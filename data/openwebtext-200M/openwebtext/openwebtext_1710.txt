Figure of Eadgyth from 1510 .
She ate lots of fish , rode frequently , may have suffered from a disease or an eating disorder at 10 and regularly moved around the chalky uplands of southern England , presumably as she followed her regal father around his kingdom .
Analysis of remains found in a German cathedral have not only confirm they belonged to the granddaughter of the English king Alfred the Great but also given an insight into the life and times of a Saxon princess .
Eadgyth ( roughly pronounced Edith ) was packed off by her brother as a diplomatic gift to Otto , the king of Saxony , more than 1,000 years ago .
She died aged 36 and her remains were thought to have been lost forever until body parts were found wrapped in silk in a lead coffin two years ago .
Earlier this year the skeletal fragments were brought back to Britain , and experts at Bristol University will today spell out why they are sure the remains are those of Eadgyth and what they know of her life .
Mark Horton , an archaeology professor at Bristol , said it was " incredibly exciting " to confirm that the bones were the princess 's and to find out more about her life .
" This period was when England was really formed , " he said .
" We do n't know much about these dark age queens and princesses .
This has created a connection with one of them . "
Eadgyth was born in Wessex in 910 into one of the most powerful families in England .
She was daughter of Edward the Elder , and half - sister to Athelstan , the first king of all England .
In 929 Athelstan sent her and her sister , Adiva , off to Otto and invited him to take his pick , sealing an alliance between two of the rising stars of the Saxon world .
Eadgyth was chosen and the couple had at least two children before she died in 946 .
Chroniclers of the time paid tribute to her beauty and recorded how devoted Otto was to her .
She was also praised for her good works .
Eadgyth was buried in a monastery , but her bones were moved several times before being interred in an elaborate tomb in Magdeburg Cathedral in Saxony - Anhalt in 1510 .
It had been assumed that the bones had vanished and the tomb was empty , but in 2008 German archaeologists opened it and found it contained a lead box holding skeletal remains .
The challenge for the archaeologists was to show that the remains , which had been moved so often , and could easily have been substituted by others , were those of Eadgyth .
A study of the bones at the University of Mainz confirmed that the remains belonged to a single female , who died between 30 and 40 .
One of the femur heads suggested the individual was a frequent horse rider , hinting at her nobility .
Analysis of the bones suggested she enjoyed a high - protein diet , including a large quantity of fish , which again suggested she was an aristocrat .
It proved impossible to extract DNA from the remains – and the problem then , anyway , would have been fbut finding a sample of a descendant to try to match them to .
Unfortunately vital parts were missing , including hands , feet and much of the skull .
But crucial scientific evidence came from the study of the teeth preserved in the upper jaw .
A technique measuring the strontium and oxygen isotopes mineralised in the teeth as they are formed was used .
The value of these isotopes depends on the local environment and its underlying geology – this valuable data is effectively " locked into " the teeth .
Studying tiny samples of enamel allowed scientists to work out that she must have spent time in Wessex 's chalky uplands .
Horton said it had been possible to map almost month by month where the woman had lived as a child and were able to check this against what is known about Eadgyth 's youth .
But the findings added detail to what was known .
He said : " Eadgyth seems to have spent the first eight years of her life in southern England , but changed her domicile frequently , matching quite variable strontium ratios in her teeth .
Only from the age of nine , the isotope values remain constant .
" Eadgyth must have moved around the kingdom following her father , King Edward the Elder during his reign .
When her mother was divorced in 919 – Eadgyth was between nine and ten at that point –both were banished to a monastery , maybe Winchester or Wilton in Salisbury . "
Trauma was also indicated in her skeleton around this same age , suggesting a dramatic change in her circumstances .
She may at this time have suffered a disease or eating disorder , said the scientists .
More tests will be carried out on the material found in the coffin but the princess will be laid to rest later this year when the bones are reburied in Magdeburg Cathedral .
A year after railing about the high tax burden on wealthy New Yorkers , Rush Limbaugh , the conservative radio talk - show host , is severing one more tie with New York , selling his lushly decorated Fifth Avenue penthouse to an undisclosed buyer .
Mr. Limbaugh 's 10 - room condominium , which features a 30 - foot - wide living room with fireplace and four terraces overlooking Central Park at East 86th Street , went into contract Thursday for a bit under the final $ 12.95 million asking price , brokers said .
One ...
With “ developing ” and wealthy nations now battling over obtaining their fair share of global carbon emissions , the belief that all people will someday enjoy the standard of living of the wealthy nations has become an unmistakable fantasy .
Human societies are already in overshoot , consuming the resources of one and a third earths every year .
If everyone on earth were to consume as much as people in the United States , humanity would be consuming the resources of five planet earths and there would soon be little of nature – or us – left .
Yet the rising and very numerous middle classes in rapidly industrializing nations such as Brazil , India , and China are joining the shopping spree .
Meanwhile one fourth of humanity , 1.4 billion , live on $ 1.25 or less per day and are unable to meet their basic needs .
The belief that the poor nations and poor people of the earth would eventually catch up and enjoy an abundant standard of living has allowed well - meaning people in the wealthy nations to act as if their own high incomes and consumption were unrelated to the poverty of others .
Now that the limits of the earth are at hand the question “ What is my fair share ? ” is getting tough to avoid .
I want an answer to this question .
I do n’t want to participate in destroying nature and I do n’t want to be responsible for other people living with hunger .
But , I do want to live .
How much can I have ?
To discover my fair share I started with statistics from the World Bank ( World Development Indicators : 2008 ) .
The average per capita gross national income for the world in 2008 , equalized by “ purchasing power parity ” , was $ 10,357 .
The purchasing power parity correction makes it easy to compare income in different countries , despite the fact that the same amount of money can buy much more in some countries than others .
For example , you could buy half a dozen bananas in India for the same amount of money that would get you one banana in New York City ( example from Norm Myers and Jennifer Kent in their book The New Consumers ) .
The purchasing power parity correction rate for India is 5.35 ( as of 2002 ) .
The international standard is the U.S. dollar so the same amount of money goes 5.35 times further in India than in the U.S.
In other words if you are in the U.S. you can think of the $ 10,357 average world income as actual U.S. dollars .
If you are in any other country , then you must use the purchasing power parity correction for your country .
But , the figure of $ 10,357 is the average gross national income , which is not the same as personal income because it includes things like the average amount of money your government spends on infrastructure .
In 2008 gross national income in the U.S. was $ 46,970 , but U.S. personal income before taxes was $ 40,189 and spendable income was $ 35,486 ( Bureau of Economic Analysis , bea.gov ) .
According to Myers and Kent , actual purchasing power for the world in 2002 was 60 % of gross national income , corrected for purchasing power parity ( and 70 % for the U.S. ) .
Let ’s say then that my actual purchasing power would be roughly $ 6500 ( somewhere between 60 % and 70 % of $ 10,357 ) .
Whoops !
What about Carbon ?
But , wait !
There ’s a problem .
At current levels of world income humanity is producing such a large quantity of greenhouse gases that we are threatening the continuation of human civilization and much of life on earth .
The Global Humanitarian Forum , a think tank directed by former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan , estimates that global warming is already causing 300,000 human deaths per year .
To reduce greenhouse gases either income and related production must be reduced from the current world average ( meaning I ’d get less than $ 6500 ) , world population must drop significantly , or every dollar spent must result in much less carbon entering the stratosphere .
Damage to the environment is commonly calculated by multiplying these three factors ( i.e. Impact =Population x Affluence x Technology ) .
Both population ( .7 % per year ) and income ( 1.4 % per year ) are growing .
The most palatable option for the world ’s rich is the third option , commonly known as reducing carbon intensity .
Carbon intensity can be decreased by increasing efficiency ( producing goods and services with less energy ) and by using non-carbon energy sources like solar power .
Over the past 25 years carbon intensity has improved by almost 23 % worldwide .
But , this downward trend has not been consistent over the years .
Since the year 2000 carbon intensity has worsened worldwide .
With worsening carbon intensity , increasing income , and increasing population the total amount of carbon going into the atmosphere has increased by 3.5 % per year since 2000 ( up from under 1 % in the 1990s ) .
This rate of increase is far higher than the rates assumed in any of the models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in making its predictions of future global warming .
Even with the Kyoto Protocol , no part of the world has succeeded in diminishing its carbon emissions .
Prosperity Without Growth , a recent report from the United Kingdom ’s Sustainable Development Commission , has calculated the improvements in carbon intensity that would be necessary to offset projected growth in population and income between now and 2050 and still reduce carbon in the atmosphere down to 450 ppm .
While in 2007 carbon intensity was at 768 grams of carbon dioxide per dollar we would need to get down to 36 grams per dollar by 2050 .
In other words carbon intensity would need to improve by 21 times !
Remember that 25 years of technological improvements between 1980 and 2005 were only able to improve emissions 1.3 times ( from 1000 to 768 grams carbon dioxide per dollar ) .
This projection allows for slow income growth , but no equalization of income between rich and poor countries .
If world income were to equalize at current European Union levels by 2050 , allowing no income increases in the developed world , carbon intensity would need to diminish to 14 grams carbon dioxide per dollar , 55 times better than today .
This last scenario presumes no income growth in the European Union , a loss in income for the U.S. , and large gains in income throughout the developing world .
Prosperity Without Growth concludes that these levels of improvement in carbon intensity are not feasible and that economic growth cannot safely continue .
Worldwatch attempted to put similar figures into perspective by pointing out that for everyone on the Earth to live at the EU levels expected in 2050 if “ normal ” growth continues we would need cars capable of getting 700 or 800 miles per gallon !
It looks like even my fair share of $ 6500 is too much unless a revolution in technology dropped carbon intensity down to nearly nothing .
Since new technologies take decades to come into common usage , the hope for such a revolution is just a fantasy , albeit a popular and dangerous one .
The only other alternative – and this is just a personal solution – would be for me to find a way to spend my dollars on products and services that emit almost no carbon .
Shrinking Ecological Footprints
Carbon emissions are not the only constraint on growth .
Globalized industrial patriarchy has been stripping the earth of every “ resource ” and is already butting up against other shortages such as water .
The resource thieves in the “ developed ” world , myself included , must cut back their lifestyles .
The world average gross income of $ 10,357 gives us a rough and too high upper limit and a clear message that drastic lifestyle cuts are called for since most people in the developed world have far higher incomes than this .
Ideally , entire nations will take up the challenge to quickly dismantle their polluting systems and adopt new ways of life that involve far less consumption .
While we as individuals are pressing for the massive social change needed , we can begin the process by changing own way of life and setting an example for others .
But , where to start ?
Whether setting about change at a national level or an individual level , a measure that quantifies how much different activities take from the earth is necessary .
Here ’s where calculating national or individual ecological footprints can help .
With an ecological footprint analysis , the resources required to produce the specific products and services consumed can be estimated and translated into a land equivalent , measured in square yards , square meters , acres or hectares .
For example , a pound of potatoes requires about 33 square yards of land if grown using industrial farming methods .
The potato plants themselves use a small growing space , but the chemical input , farm machinery , and transportation to market all contribute to the footprint or land area required to produce the potatoes .
Similarly , a kilowatt hour of electricity from the grid uses 31 square yards of land , while the solar equivalent takes under a third of a yard .
A full ecological footprint for a nation or an individual is the land equivalent for everything consumed in a year .
In the United States the average ecological footprint for each person is 23 acres .
But , if you divide the amount of productive land on the earth ( 2.8 billion acres excluding polar regions , deserts and deep sea ) by the earth ’s population of over 6 billion , the bioproductive land available to each person to produce everything consumed would be 5 acres .
Therefore , in the U.S. we are each using 18 acres of land more than the earth can spare for us .
These figures do not provide land for all the other species on the planet , so each person ’s 5 acre allotment must be cut back further .
Jim Merkel ’s excellent book , Radical Simplicity , provides detailed instructions for calculating your own ecological footprint , along with tables that show the land equivalent required for a wide range of products and services .
As a longtime practitioner of radical simplicity Merkel has lived on $ 5000 and an ecological footprint of 3 acres of land for many years .
His book describes scenarios for a life lived with a 1 acre , 3 acre , or 6 acre ecological footprint .
On 3 acres , an amount that is enough less than the world personal allotment of 5 acres to allow at least some room for wildlife , the sample lifestyle is far removed from that of the typical American .
While plenty of veggies , fruit , beans and grains could be eaten , meat , dairy products , juice , and alcohol would be excluded from the diet because they require too many resources .
The living space would be quite small ( 150 square feet or so ) in a very energy efficient building such as a straw bale house .
A very small allotment of fuel oil or firewood for heating would be possible .
Transportation would be largely by bicycle or on foot with 50 miles of bus travel and a couple of gallons of gasoline allotted per month .
Air travel would be impossible .
Returning to Traditional Lifeways : The Real Sustainability Revolution
If all of this sounds like returning to a third world way of life , then you are correct .
The average ecological footprint of the low income nations is under 2.5 acres .
The peoples of both Africa ( 3.4 acres ) and Asia / Pacific ( 4 acres ) consume less than their share of the Earth ’s biocapacity while those in Latin America ( 6 acres ) and the Middle East / Central Asia ( 5.7 acres ) slightly exceed their share .
People are obviously capable of living on less than a 5 acre footprint .
Although some people in the global South have far too few resources , this does not mean that one cannot live well without overdrawing the Earth ’s biocapacity .
Deprivation results when traditional peoples have their ways of life disrupted by thefts of land , water , or other resources , as has happened to many , thanks to the powerful forces of first colonization and now globalization .
Where necessary resources are still available and communities are left intact , traditional and truly sustainable ways of life continue ( See Ecofeminism by Maria Mies and Vandana Shiva , 1993 ) .
The peasants and indigenous peoples still living largely traditional lives in direct interaction with the Earth and each other are the models that those of us living in the heart of globalized industrial patriarchy need .
Although small scale , traditional cultures may ( or may not ) have problematic patriarchal social structures , these cultures are able to maintain the Earth ’s fertility and health and do not require huge amounts of energy from dangerous energy sources .
People immersed in globalized industrial patriarchy view traditional ways of life as inferior because these lifeways have been the target of an enormous smear campaign since the era of European colonization and then the inception of industry .
Traditional people ( and this includes all our ancestors ) leave the land and their traditions when the powerful forces of industrializing , colonizing or globalizing patriarchy take the land and destroy their communities .
Forced into cities or other participation in the globalized patriarchy , the propaganda of the dominating culture eventually persuades most displaced people that the old ways of life are inferior or too hard .
But , now it is time to reverse this process !
We can recognize the value of traditional ways of life linked directly to nature and local communities , dismantle globalized industrial patriarchy , and build new subsistence cultures .
The traditional lifeways of indigenous peoples , peasants of the global South , and our own ancestors are our models for sustainability .
Many of these small - scale , traditional cultures are also models for equalizing distribution of resources and more equitable social relationships .
Some have matriarchal social structures ( matrilineal , matrilocal ) and these cultures deserve the closest study .
Low - tech , modern inventions like bio-intensive gardening and perhaps bicycling can also help us to build subsistence cultures , as can social practices like consensus decision - making and consciousness raising .
In contrast , the vision of “ sustainability ” put forward by most of the political and educated classes of the industrialized world leaves many of the deadly bases of the dominant society untouched : industrialization , consumerism , capitalism , inequity , domination , patriarchy .
Almost all the books , government reports , and even non-governmental organizations proposing solutions to climate change assume that industrialized society must continue .
They call for major changes in practice – energy efficiency , recycling , de- carbonizing energy sources , even sometimes for an end to inequity – but do not address the roots of the problem .
How can a system based in domination ( patriarchy ) and greed ( capitalism ) and therefore dedicated to giving more power and more goodies to some people create equity among people and live in balance with the Earth ?
Why would a sane people who care for the earth want to gamble that an aberrant way of life can be reined in enough to preserve the climate when there are existing ways of life that have worked for our species for thousands of years ?
Perhaps there may ( or may not ) be ways to live with the earth that could include some benefits from modern technology , but revolutionary changes are needed , not a new consumerism and more of the same old patriarchy .
Only by getting rid of the social elements that have created the climate crisis , poverty , and ecological overshoot – patriarchy , capitalism , domination , consumerism – will we save the Earth and save our Selves .
Writing about my fair share has not been easy , but the writing is the easy part .
How will I ever get my income and ecological footprint down to a level that does not hurt the Earth and steal from much of humanity ?
One step at a time is my only answer .
The largest part of our ecological footprint here at Cedar Hill comes from the miles driven in two four wheel drive vehicles , the firewood burnt for heating the house , and , to a lesser extent , the food we eat .
Our automobile usage seems hard to modify at the present moment due to our remote location , rough roads , lack of public transportation and a commitment to eldercare for my mother .
We are currently creating window quilts and sealing up the house more effectively to reduce firewood use .
We ’re also growing more of our food on site and moving away from trucking in garden inputs .
Fortunately , reducing income does have a clear upside : less time spent working for money and more time available for fighting patriarchy , spending time in nature , and working and playing on the homestead !
“ AN EIGHT - YEAR -OLD today sees the internet with about as much fascination as you see the toilet , ” says Dean Kamen , an inventor and entrepreneur .
“ To kids , they 're the same .
Nothing magical , nothing exciting , just there when they need it .
That 's how quickly technology changes — and it is n't just moving fast , it 's moving at an accelerating rate . ”
Mr Kamen knows all about speed .
Over 40 frantic years of inventing , he has amassed more than 440 patents worldwide , saved thousands of lives and created at least one cultural icon — the balancing Segway scooter .
Now he is turning his attention to nurturing the next generation of innovators .
“ I 'm helping to create an army of kids that is going to build industries you and I wo n't understand , ” he says .
“ In 10 or 20 years , one of these kids is going to cure cancer or make an engine that does n't pollute .
And as they receive their Nobel prize , someone is going to ask them what made them do it . ”
Their answer , Mr Kamen hopes , will name - check FIRST ( For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology ) , a glitzy robotics competition that he started in 1989 and which now attracts over 200,000 entrants annually from schools in 56 countries .
Working in teams supervised by a professional scientist or engineer , children construct and control robots in a series of competitive challenges , egged on by cheerleaders , screaming parents and the prospect of scholarships worth $ 12.2 m in 2010 alone .
If that all sounds suspiciously similar to American high - school sports , it is no accident .
“ I want kids to realise that engineering and problem solving are every bit as fun and rewarding as bounce , bounce , bounce , throw , ” says Mr Kamen .
“ I want FIRST to compete with the Superbowl , the World Series and the Olympics .
The next generation of real wealth is going to be produced in fields like proteomics , genomics and nanotechnology .
For that you need world - class technology people , and if kids do n't get on the train very early , it 's left the station . ”
Despite his focus on the future , Mr Kamen 's corner office at DEKA , his design and research company based in Manchester , New Hampshire , is crammed with icons of scientific and technological history .
There 's a Galilean thermometer on his desk and Einstein memorabilia in every corner .
Fading cartoons of his Segway adorn the bare brick walls .
Mr Kamen is a man who lives science , breathes technology and can't quite understand why everyone else does n't feel the same way .
“ If you look at the way science and technology are presented today , it 's worse than they just do n't get their fair share of time , ” he says .
“ It 's like somebody brilliantly set out to undermine any prospect for the average kid— especially girls and minorities — to feel excited about science .
When children see a scientist on television , it 's either a squeaky , geeky misfit kid or a middle - aged white male with frizzy hair and a German accent . ”
With the exception of his native New York vowels , Mr Kamen 's stereotype sounds like a self - portrait , such is the extent to which he conforms to the cliché of the mad scientist .
From a hexagonal , high - tech base on his own private island ( the self - proclaimed Empire of North Dumpling ) , he hatches grandiose plans to save humanity .
Traffic - busting electric vehicles !
Devices that promise free power from waste !
Machines to remove salt from seawater !
Then there are the gadgets .
He is the inventor of the iBot , a stair - climbing wheelchair , and has built gizmos for the American army including robot arms and fin - like prosthetics that allow soldiers to swim at twice their usual speed .
Lighting the way
Such a larger - than - life existence seems appropriate for a self - taught inventor whose father drew cartoons for Weird Science magazine in the 1950s .
Once a squeaky , geeky misfit kid himself , his inventing career began at the age of 16 , when he devised a dynamic lighting system that could respond to sound .
He then wangled his way into the Hayden Planetarium in New York and convinced the director to buy several of the machines for $ 2,000 each .
When his elder brother , a medical student , complained of the difficulties in administering insulin to diabetics , Mr Kamen dropped out of college and created the world 's first wearable drug- infusion pump .
“ I built these pumps and I thought within a year all diabetics would wear them , ” he says .
In fact , it took more than 15 years to go from the first prototype to widespread medical use .
In 1971 Mr Kamen set up a company to manufacture the pumps , and in 1982 he sold it to Baxter International , a medical - equipment firm .
He then founded DEKA , a contract - research firm , and went on to design a home - dialysis machine that scaled down existing devices from the size of a washing machine to something no bigger than a shoebox .
As with the portable infusion pump , this freed patients from having to make regular hospital visits for treatment , and took more than a decade to reach the market .
( This year Baxter and America 's Food & Drug Administration conducted a recall of some HomeChoice machines following reports of serious injuries and at least one death linked to its use . )
Technology is easy to develop .
Developing a new attitude , moving the culture , is the difficult part
Next came the iBot Transporter , a self - balancing , six - wheeled robotic wheelchair capable of going up and down stairs , navigating difficult terrain and “ standing ” to raise its user to eye level with other people .
Co-developed by DEKA and Independence Technology , a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson , a health - care giant , the wheelchairs cost $ 26,000 each .
They have transformed hundreds of lives , and inspire fierce loyalty among their users , but are no longer manufactured .
The invention for which Mr Kamen is best known is the Segway Transporter , a gloriously over - engineered stand - up scooter that had the misfortune to emerge just after the dotcom crash in 2001 , just as the disillusioned technology industry was looking for the next big thing .
Before its unveiling , Mr Kamen 's mysterious new invention was the subject of feverish speculation .
Steve Jobs of Apple said it was “ as big a deal as the PC ” and John Doerr , a venture capitalist , mused that it would be “ bigger than the internet ” .
It was , in fact , a rather clever two - wheeled , self - balancing scooter , using technology similar to the iBot .
But after all the hype it could not possibly live up to expectations .
Nine years on the Segway has yet to sell as many units as the firm predicted for its first nine months .
Segways glide through theme parks , around warehouses and along Silicon Valley pavements , but are seldom seen elsewhere .
Segway Inc , the company established to commercialise the technology , was sold to a British firm earlier this year .
That does not mean the idea was fundamentally wrong , Mr Kamen insists .
“ Cities were made to be highly dense environments for pedestrians , while the car is a piece of hardware that was optimised to go really far , really fast , ” he says .
Over half the world 's population now lives in cities , he notes .
“ I do n't know if people will be using Segways to get around cities in 20 years ' time , but I do know they wo n't be using cars .
The financial , emotional , political and environmental costs will be prohibitive . ”
Despite the sluggish acceptance of his medical innovations and the sniggering at his Segways , Mr Kamen is pressing on with other new ideas .
If it takes a few years for society to catch up with his futuristic visions , so be it .
His latest invention is an electrical generator based on a 19th - century idea — an unusually efficient kind of engine , called a Stirling engine — which never caught on .
“ With the Stirling , we 've built the world 's neatest little high reliability package that will turn any form of waste into power , ” he says .
He has experimented with Stirling engines in electric cars and motorbikes , but his real target is the developing world .
In trials in Bangladesh , a village used one of the engines to generate electricity for nearly six months using only cow dung for fuel .
The generator has a sidekick : a water - purification machine , called Slingshot .
One of these rugged devices can turn 1,000 litres a day of contaminated groundwater , polluted river water or seawater into drinking water .
“ You can wipe out 50 % of all human diseases just by giving everybody clean water , ” says Mr Kamen .
“ My fantasy is to give everybody electricity without destroying the environment , and to use some of that electricity to give everybody water in a sustainable way . ”
But moving the machines into mass production has proved problematic .
“ When you 're trying to get electricity to a few billion people who 've never had electricity , or who are sick and dying because they 've never had clean water , it 's not a technology problem , ” says Mr Kamen .
“ It 's an infrastructure , mindset , logistics and sustainability problem that has so many dimensions to it . ”
The health - care firms that license Mr Kamen 's other inventions are not well placed to market his water and power machines where they are needed most .
“ They 're interested in health care and interested in my projects , ” he explains .
“ But in many cases they have no capacity to deliver and sustain these technologies .
There are 206 countries out there , but most medical - device companies do business only in the world 's richest 40 or 50 . ”
Once again , Mr Kamen has had more trouble than he anticipated in trying to take an idea from a successful prototype to a successful product .
“ Technology is easy to develop , ” he says .
“ Developing a new attitude , moving the culture from one mental model to another , that 's the difficult part .
You give people a solution to a problem and the great irony to me is that even though they 're unhappy , they have high inertia .
People do n't like change .
The reason it takes technology 15 or 20 years to come in is because 15 years is the time it takes a kid who saw it when he was young to become a functioning adult . ”
If at first you do n't succeed …
Which brings him back to FIRST , the invention of which Mr Kamen is most proud .
“ It really is an invention because it was a different way to attack a fundamental social problem , ” he says .
“ For any one product I worked on , if I did n't do it , someone else would have .
Maybe they would have done it a little later , or a little differently , but they would have done it .
But when I look out in the stands at tens of thousands of kids each year during FIRST , I see all the scientists that are going to work on the really exciting stuff that 's going to happen over the next 15 years .
They will be making materials that have no resistance and can carry millions of amps , creating materials that can make , store and transform energy , understanding how to build at a molecular level to synthesise proteins and fix health problems , literally by engineering life . ”
Throughout his career Mr Kamen has been an instigator , proposing new ideas that have not always been well received .
Over 1 m children have taken part in FIRST 's contests over the years , and Mr Kamen hopes that they will instigate big changes of their own .
But as the Emperor of North Dumpling has found repeatedly , there is a big difference between coming up with an idea and making it happen .
Image caption Fricker 's lawyer said he would appeal against the sentence
A Swiss man has been sentenced to five months in jail and three strokes of a cane for spray - painting graffiti on a train in Singapore .
Oliver Fricker , 32 , a software consultant , admitted breaking into a depot and vandalising the train .
The judge called it a serious breach of security .
Caning in Singapore involves being struck with a wooden stick on the back of the thigh , which can leave permanent scars .
Amnesty International called the sentence barbaric .
Accomplice
Judge See Kee Oon said Fricker 's actions were " calculated criminal conduct " .
" He was fully conscious of the criminal nature of the act and must be prepared to face the consequences , " the judge said .
Singapore says it is still hunting for a second man , UK national Lloyd Dane Alexander , who it believes took part in the spray - painting .
Fricker was arrested on 25 May , eight days after the incident and two days before he was to leave for a new job in Switzerland .
Prosecutors said the pair spray - painted the words " McKoy " and " Banos " on two carriages - a signature that has featured in graffiti works in other countries .
It is not clear if the two men are the duo behind the other works , or imitators .
Vandalism in Singapore carries a fine of up to S$ 2,000 ( $ 1,437 ) or up to three years in jail , in addition to three to eight strokes of a cane .
New Labour never give up .
Even out of government , they are still looking for groups of individuals who , they believe , are just salivating at the prospect of the chance to carry a shiny new ID card .
The latest group lucky enough to enter their sights just happens to be the transgendered .
The Identity Documents Bill , which is intended to assert the Coalition ’s new position vis -à - vis matters like identity cards is currently at the Committee stage in the House of Commons .
On Tuesday , Labour MP and one - time Identity Minister Meg Hillier was on her feet proposing an amendment , which stated : " Any ID card issued to a transgendered person , which is valid immediately before the day on which this Act is passed , shall continue to be valid until the Secretary of State has laid before both Houses of Parliament a report to the effect that the Secretary of State is satisfied that an identity document in the assigned gender is available for issue to a transgendered person . "
Clear ?
The point she was attempting to get at was that individuals who are in the process of transitioning – that is , mid gender re-assignment – could face embarrassing situations due to the fact that they might wish to maintain the façade of one gender at work , whilst being fully " out " to friends and family .
Labour had previously made provision for transgendered individuals to be allowed to own two ID cards , one in each gender .
The amendment was then taken out and given a good kicking , in polite parliamentary style , by two Lib Dems : the new MP for Cambridge , Julian Huppert , and Lynne Featherstone , Junior Minister responsible for the Equality brief .
Huppert instantly spotted the logic failure at the heart of Hillier ’s proposal .
While the amendment was intended to prevent a particular group being " outed " , the fact that this amendment would make the transgendered the only group of UK citizens in the country still carrying identity cards would be a de facto outing by the government .
He also introduced an intriguing notion and marker for future debate , suggesting that maybe the simplest solution was not more bureaucracy , but the removal of gender identity from any documents unless it was absolutely necessary .
Lynne Featherstone was equally in no mood to give ground .
She pointed out that " this clause would have no practical effect except for requiring the Secretary of State to lay an unnecessary report before both Houses of Parliament .
I am sure that is not what the hon .
Lady intended , but that would be the effect of the new clause . "
The amendment was withdrawn , with Hillier grumbling aloud about the lack of consultation and an evidence - based policy on the part of the Coalition .
Bootnote
According to Meg Hillier ’s constituency site , she is " currently a junior minister at the Home Office " .
This may come as news to the Coalition , who may be working under the misapprehension that Labour Members of Parliament had been removed from offices of state when the last administration departed , in early May .
Perhaps this is not the case – and Ms Hillier is still secretly beavering away beneath their very noses . ®

Kinekt Design launched their first product , a beautiful modern ring called the Gear Ring , inspired by small mechanisms .
The idea comes from Glen Liberman , who wanted to create a complex object that you can play with while wearing it .
The result is a stainless steel ring with 6 gears that turn as you spin the outer rims .
The Gear Ring is made from matte stainless steel , 316L , and is available in the US ring sizes 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 , but soon you ’ll find it also in 5,6,7 and 8 .

Man the lifeboats
The great ship of state is steaming full - speed - ahead towards a colossal iceberg .
When it goes down , everyone aboard and anyone nearby will get sucked down into an icy totalitarian tomb along with it .
Unconstitutional usurpations of liberty and property are getting signed by the president of the USA so fast it is hard to keep track – and the mainstream media is n’t even trying ( mostly because the legislative sponsors also own the media , but that ’s another story altogether ) .
Just about the time I think I need to strap on my life jacket and swim away from impending doom , I find more people than I imagined launching lifeboats .
This is wonderful news .
I am thrilled to share bits of it with you .
The Tenth Amendment Center takes its name from that part of The Bill of Rights that says , “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or the people . ”
This is one exciting place that I cannot recommend highly enough .
There IS a lot going on .
People ARE using the law of the land to defend liberties whose protection was written into the Constitution 230 years ago .
From there you can find articles and links to other activities and actions that say there are a lot of us out there and there is hope that there just might be some free countries left when the dust settles on the nightmare from DC .
It will get a lot tougher if / when they take the uncontrolled Internet away from us , but for now you can see a lot of activity and more resistance to statism than you might have felt from your immediate surroundings and heard on your evening news .
Michael Boldin put it together in a great article at the Campaign for Liberty .
I found most of the list below linked in that article .
Here ’s his list and more … a heartening bunch for sure .
12 states have passed 10th amendment resolutions .
25 states passed laws and resolutions nullifying the Real ID act .
7 states have passed firearms freedom acts .
14 states have legalized medical marijuana .
28 states are dabbling with health care freedom .
I could spend longer building this list , but suffice it to say , “ The news is good ” .

I 'll be honest : " Vincent and the Doctor " was the first time I 've fallen in love with Doctor Who this season .
It had a strong emotional arc , a visceral horror , and humor that felt completely un -forced .
Spoilers ahead ...

( BTW I wanted to hold off posting this until our current technical glitches were behind us .
Hence the delay , which I apologize for .
Sadly , the glitches seem to show no sign of abating . )
I should add that I have n't disliked any of this year 's Doctor Who episodes .
There 's been no " Fear Her " this year .
It 's all been quite good , and apart from minor quibbles — like , what the blazes was up with the Smilers in " The Beast Below " ? —
I 've mostly enjoyed every episode on its own terms .
I would cheerfully concede that every episode this year has been above average for the series as a whole .
But still , a lot of the storytelling has felt a bit been - there - done - that ... until " Vincent and the Doctor . "
Which I could n't stop obsessing about , both while watching and for a long time afterwards .
Advertisement
At first blush , " Vincent And The Doctor " is just another one of the show 's " meeting famous historical personnages " outings , which have included Charles Dickens , Queen Victoria , William Shakespeare and Agatha Christie in the past .
It 's only once you get sunk into it that it feels like a very different beast altogether .
This is entirely due to Richard Curtis ' uncompromising script and Tony Curran 's performance as Vincent Van Gogh .
Unlike the other historical figures the show 's visited , Vincent feels heart - breakingly real and complicated , and not at all a pastiche .
The " tormented genius " thing is a total cliche , but Curtis and Curran manage to infuse it with extra dimensions .
This episode 's version of Van Gogh is n't just tortured by the loathing of his fellow humans — although the scene where the grieving mother throws rocks at him early on is horrifying — but he's also wracked with realistically - depicted depression .
And even in his cheerful moments , he 's convinced that he's not a very good painter , and that anybody who claims to like his paintings is automatically suspect .
And yet , even though Vincent has a rock - bottom opinion of his own skill and talent , he 's still as ambitious as hell .
He wants to capture the raw energy of nature in a way that no other painter has .
He feels as though nature is shouting at him to capture its majesty .
And he 's bursting with strong opinions about how painters should try to represent the things that normal eyes can't see .
He 's a huge contradiction — utterly arrogant , and yet full of self - loathing and self - deprecation .
In other words , he 's an artist .
And Curtis builds an entire plot around the idea that Vincent really does see the world differently , and this allows him to see the Monster Of The Week , the Krafayis .
Which looks like a vengeful giant chicken , but at least it 's no Ergon .
It 's a neat idea to turn Van Gogh 's " special " vision into the crux of the plot .
And then the Krafayis turns out to be blind and an outcast from its own kind , thus making it sort of the monster equivalent of Van Gogh in a sense .
Van Gogh does for the creature what he 'll do for himself , all too soon — put it out of its misery .

Van Gogh 's impending suicide hangs over the whole thing like a shroud , and the episode takes a less - is - more approach to showing the depression that will claim him — there 's really only one short scene of Vincent sobbing and screaming at the Doctor to get out , but the suicide is referred to obliquely enough times that it 's impossible to forget .
The episode 's themes all come together in this absolutely breathtaking clip , where Van Gogh manages to show Amy and the Doctor how he really does view the night sky .
It 's like his painting come to life , and it 's both wild and joyful .
You 're left wondering how a man who can see so vividly would choose to kill himself .
And as if in keeping with the material , this is one of the more arty Doctor Whos in general — the chase scene , with the Doctor fleeing the Krafayis and only able to see it through the mirror on his godmother 's old gadget , is brilliantly gray - tinged with the dawn light , and yet it feels utterly kinetic and sharp .
And the splashes of color , from the sunflowers and Amy 's scarf among other things , burst out of the picture .

And not surprisingly from the co-writer of every single Blackadder episode , the humor in this one is also great , including the Doctor 's weird jokes about representational versus non-representational art , Gainsborough and Picasso .
" If there 's one thing I can't stand , it 's an unpunctual alien attack . "
And the scene where the Doctor and Bill Nighy admire each other 's bow ties .
And the whole " could you breathe more quietly " bit inside the confessional .
I think one reason why I loved this episode more than most of the others this year is because it felt , effortlessly , like it was about something .
I mean , " The Beast Below " was a fairly blunt political allegory , and you can pull out messages from some of the other episodes this year .
But " Vincent and the Doctor " felt as though it was exploring a universal set of themes in a uniquely personal way , and it did n't offer any easy answers .
And then there 's the ending , which is one of the most amazingly brave things I 've ever seen .
It could so easily have been a horrible , cheesy disaster — the Doctor takes Van Gogh forward to the present , so he can see how much people come to admire him .
But it does n't feel cheap at all — it 's the artist 's ultimate dream come to life , being able to see yourself admired by strangers long after you 're gone .
A kind of immortality .
I can't imagine watching the scene where Nighy explains Van Gogh 's stature to the artist himself without getting choked up .

And then Van Gogh goes and kills himself at age 37 anyway , because even knowing that he 's destined for greatness does n't really change anything in the end .
As the Doctor puts it , they added to Van Gogh 's store of good things , but that does n't always change the bad things .
The only changes they 've managed to make in Van Gogh 's legacy are minor ones : the monster is no longer in the church , and one painting of flowers is inscribed to Amy .
I feel like this is one of the Who episodes that I 'll get something new out of every time I watch it , partly because it reflects what you bring to it .
Brilliant stuff .

It is fun to run a monopoly .
But in the long run , it can be a lot less enjoyable to own one .
Why ?
Companies change as they grow larger and more profitable .
Bureaucracy and success slow innovation .
Will this new product hurt an old one ?
If so , should we delay , or price it very high ?
Old monopolists find themselves outrun by newer companies with no stake in the old ways .
Bosses of monopolies are highly unlikely to view themselves as lucky rather than brilliant .
Being better than everyone else , they act haughtily toward competitors and customers alike .
People start looking for a way to even the playing field .
Eventually , the antitrust lawyers arrive .
With them comes the threat of management sclerosis , because the lawyers ’ presence affects corporate behavior .
Once a company comes to understand that being too successful may be bad for its future , it is really hard to stay on the cutting edge .
This week , the French Competition Authority officially declared Google a monopoly .
That conclusion is hardly novel , but the decision appears to go beyond any previous official ruling in the United States or elsewhere .
In a region widely criticized for its human rights record , a handful of activists in Kyrgyzstan are attempting to enact significant reforms in how the state defends transgender individuals from harassment .
Seizing on what they say is a liberal intermission in Kyrgyzstan ’s transition from autocracy to parliamentary democracy – before elections this fall – they are fighting for the right to change the gender markers in their government - issued documents .
“ Transgender individuals in Kyrgyzstan often struggle to find employment ; many are unable to open bank accounts or sign legal documents because their appearances do n’t match the gender in their passports , ” says Dahn Pak , a transgender man .
Experts on LGBT ( Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender ) issues say a clear procedural framework to change a person ’s gender on paper would be the first step in ending the discrimination .
A Ministry of Health working group composed of legal and medical experts along with LGBT activists has discussed the changes since 2007 .
Though , legally , Kyrgyz citizens have the right to change their sexual identification , “ there are no mechanisms for implementation of this law .
The lack of relevant documents that define this process is a barrier to exercise this right , ” says Erik Iriskulbekov , a lawyer at the Adilet Legal Clinic in Bishkek and member of the Ministry of Health ’s working group .
Under existing legislation , transgender individuals are required to submit a medical form to their local civil registry certifying them as “ transsexuals ” in order to change their documents .
But the form in question does not exist , activists complain .
The process thus leaves their gender ambiguous .
“ One person denied the right to change his documents was told in court , ‘ No penis , No passport , ’ and the judge struck his gavel .
They said this in court ! ” exclaims Akram Kubanychbek , a member of the Ministry of Health ’s working group .
Kubanychbek is a transgender man who changed his passport ’s gender marker with the help of an inexperienced yet compassionate bureaucrat .
At a Geneva meeting in early May , the United Nations Human Rights Council provided recommendations to improve women ’s rights , including provisions to end the discrimination of women based on sexual orientation .
Kyrgyz government representatives at the meeting , known in UN parlance as a Universal Periodic Review , accepted the recommendations .
The Health Ministry working group is now waiting for the interim government to implement the recommendations .
The change is not required to go before a parliamentary vote .
Anna Kirey , an expert on LGBT rights in the former Soviet Union , is hopeful that the interim government ’s acceptance of the UN recommendations is a move forward in solidifying the rights of transgender people .
She says she is surprised the new government is even considering the modified legislation .
“ It ’s unusual for a Central Asian country to accept any [ recommended approaches ] to sexual orientation , ” Kirey says .
“ I feel the new government is going to give us a lot more space for bringing LGBT issues into a more mainstream human rights agenda . ”
[ Anna Kirey formerly worked as a writer for EurasiaNet.org . ]
But conservative public perceptions toward the LGBT community may be scaring the new government away from legislating change .
The hesitation is fueled by concerns over public backlash and rampant homophobia , says one activist who asked not to be identified .
Moreover , activists and legal experts remain skeptical of the interim government ’s ability to enact change on such a sensitive political issue given the breadth of other urgent problems facing the country .
The government is too weak , says Iriskulbekov , the human rights lawyer .
“ We are kind of lost .
That is the general feeling , ” says Syinat Sultanalieva , director of Labrys , a Bishkek - based non-profit LGBT advocacy group .
“ Before , I was sure we would get this done .
We had strong mechanisms for influence within the government – basically we knew our so - called enemy .
But this time it is very unclear .
Even though the interim government is more liberal , it does n’t mean much because unfortunately they are not the legitimate government , ” she said before a June 27 referendum where Kyrgyz voters accepted the government of Roza Otunbayeva .
A new parliament is expected to convene in the fall .
Nevertheless , now is the time to press for reform , says Alex Mamytov , a project coordinator at the Youth Human Rights Group and a transgender man .
“ One of the rules of advocacy is that if there is change in the government , you have the best shot at lobbying to make positive changes in the first two or three months .
That is what we want to do , ” Mamytov tells EurasiaNet.org .
July 2 , 2010  --
Seven weeks after a vicious sulfuric acid attack , Katie Piper readied for her release from the hospital .
The 26 - year - old former model and aspiring television presenter was burned beyond recognition when a stranger threw acid in her face on a London street in March 2008 .
" The pain was so bad I thought this guy 's thrown a match at me ...
I thought I must be a big orange fireball because it 's so painful , " she recalled .
" I remember bits of my face were coming off and bits were coming away , and my clothes were all evaporating and I was panicking .
I was banging on the windows of the shops and people were scared . "
Security cameras captured the incident and police learned that Piper 's boyfriend , Danny Lynch -- a 33 - year - old martial arts enthusiast Piper had started dating just two weeks earlier , had hired a henchman to throw the acid at the stunning model .
" This is when my life changed completely , forever … " she said , " This is when I lost my beautiful face . "
The acid melted all of the skin on her face , neck and hands and when she arrived at the hospital , she was missing an ear and parts of her nose , and was blind in one eye .
Piper 's doctors began a series of reconstructive surgeries , including a revolutionary skin graft to reconstruct her face .

But even after a marathon of reconstructive surgeries , psychological hurdles remained .
Piper , whose looks were the key to her aspiring career as a model , had n't seen a mirror since the day she was assaulted .
" I remember I had no eyelids and it was just the actual eyeballs round -- all exposed , and ... [ I ] had no nose , " Piper said .
" It was just ... it was so difficult , so alien . "
" She looked at [ her face ] and burst into tears , " said her father , David Piper .
" And she looked at me and said , ' It 's not me .
It 's not the face I was born with . ' "
In shock , Piper asked for a moment alone before the ride to her family 's home in Andover , England .
" I was alone in the room .
And I was praying and I was talking to God and I knew God had a plan for me , I knew he was taking me on a journey , " she said .
" And I decided how hard it was going to get , I was going to keep on that journey .

Piper 's Road to Recovery
Piper 's road to recovery was long and filled with many more trips to the hospital .
At home , she was forced to wear a plastic mask 23 hours a day to help her wounds heal .
The attack had stolen the carefree woman 's identity and crushed her spirit .
" I 've never been like this where there 's no point in waking up , " she said .
" I thought I was invincible , lived for the moment and loved life . "
Piper 's mother , Diane , quit her job to focus on her daughter 's care .
" I thought , ' Well , I 'll have to give up work .
Kate wo n't want to go anywhere .
She wo n't want to be seen by anybody .
She 'll become a recluse .
I will give up my life ; I will stay at home with her , ' And that was the future .
An empty future , " Diane Piper said .
But as Piper settled in at home , the fear did not wear off .
She was terrified of anyone approaching the house .
Even the doorbell was paralyzing .
" It was like having a child again , instead of having a woman , " her father said .
" If somebody dropped a tray , she would nearly come off the bed .
... She was so frightened of men , generally , and just anything that was scary .
And she had terrible days of , you know , hallucinations . "
Visions of Attackers Haunt Model
Beyond a forest of medical concerns , Piper also obsessively worried about the legal proceedings against Lynch , who authorities said had a history of violence and had paid Stefan Sylvestre to throw the acid at Piper .
" In the first few months at home , every night I 'd have nightmares about my attackers , " she said .
" I would see them over me , I 'd wake up screaming . "
By day , a glance at her reflection in the mirror sparked a firestorm of anger .
" My appearance is a constant reminder of what he did to me .
And almost like I belong to him , because it 's not really my face -- it 's the one he created through the attack , " Piper said .
" I think that 's like the only thing I feel I belong to , is him .
I always have , like , his marks all over my face , all over my body .
I 'll never be like the person I was born to be like -- the person I 'm supposed to be . "
" It was really hard , " said Piper 's younger sister Suzy .
" One day ... you sort of thought , ' Oh , you know , maybe she 's getting better . '
And then it could be even just half an hour later ... she would n't speak or she would be really upset or she'd be angry .
It was like a roller coaster . "
For over a year , Piper only left her home for trips to the hospital .
She dreaded going out in public , even shopping at the mall , because people stared .
Burned Model Celebrates Triumphant Journey
Slowly , Piper began rearranging her life .
" She sort of reached this conscious decision ... when she said , ' I am not going to be a victim .
I 'm going to be a survivor , ' " David Piper said .
Eighteen months after the incident , the former self - described " party girl " decided to throw a party for those who were a part of her terrible but triumphant journey .
" I 'd accepted that this was me .
This was my new , beautiful face , " she said .
" I 'd had a lot of help from the people that really mattered .
I wanted to thank them in a way that I could ... and I knew it would mean a lot to those people to see me enjoying myself and out .
I think that was a reward to them and to me as well . "
" I never dreamed that we'd see her like that again , " said Suzy .
" And so to look at her I just thought that it 's Kate again .
She 's back , you know .
And it was so nice . "
Her next milestone was leaving the house alone .
Piper took a short walk into town .
It was an emotional moment for Piper and her mother .
" I think I 've got a chance to build a life , and I do n't know if it 's going to be that easy , but I want to try .

Piper 's Plans for the Future
Piper first told her story in a British television documentary , " My Beautiful Face , " which gave her the platform to rebuild her life .
She now wants to help other burn victims receive the same extensive rehab that she did .
" We actually talk about it now -- she wants to set up a clinic here in London so , you know , anyone who is burnt can go to this clinic for as much rehab as possible , " said best friend Kay Little .
" I think she 's actually probably got a brighter future now than she had as a , you know , as a model and , and TV presenter . "
Piper admits that before the incident , she was self - obsessed .
" I was the most important thing in my life .
There was always something in my life that I was missing and I never knew what that hole was .
And after my accident I found a faith and , and I learned to believe in God and I started to pray …
And that void has been filled in my life , " she said .
" I feel enriched in that way through the accident .
And I think it 's taught me that I do n't want to be a cliche ... it has taught me that , you know , looks are n't everything . "
A jury found Stefan Sylvestre , the man who threw the acid , guilty of causing bodily harm .
He received a life sentence , with a minimum of 12 years in prison .
Piper 's ex-boyfriend David Lynch , who orchestrated the attack , received two life sentences , and will serve at least 16 years in jail .
" I 've got some terrible memories that will live with me forever , " Piper said .
" But slowly I 'm replacing them with some fantastic memories that nobody can take away . "

AT&T killed all - you - can - eat wireless data .
Which sadly was inevitable .
But if I 'm paying for bytes like I do for minutes , why do n't I get rollover data , too ?
Advertisement
The premise of AT&T's new wireless data plans is simple .
They 've gone to the same pricing model for data that they 've always had for voice .
Just like paying $ 40 for 450 minutes of talk time or $ 60 for 900 minutes , you pay $ 15 for 200 megabytes , or $ 25 for 2 gigabytes of data .
You 're buying a set amount of data for a fixed price , so you pay per byte , just like you pay per minute .
Same deal .
It breaks down like this :
Advertisement
AT&T is the only major carrier in the US to offer rollover minutes as a standard perk .
Any minutes you do n't use " roll over , " banking them to use later , like on a rainy day when you 're really bored and just want to sit on the phone for hours .
You pay for 1400 minutes a month , but only talk for 950 .
Those leftover 450 minutes are added to your general pool of minutes , so you 'd have 1850 to use the following month .
The net effect is that you 're legitimately buying the minutes , in the same way you purchase a 12 - pack of soda for $ 5 .
If AT&T is going to count bytes like minutes , you should get rollover bytes .
If you pay for 2 gigs of data , you should get 2 gigs of data .
If you only use 500 megabytes that month , the leftover 1.5 GB should rollover to the next month .
Particularly since there 's no middle ground between the two new plans — there 's a massive gulf , 1000 percent wide , between 200MB and 2GB .
So a lot of iPhone users are stuck , since they use somewhere between 200MB and 2 GB of data — not skimpy enough to grab the cheaper $ 15 - a - month plan , but not anything approaching 2GB .
( A $ 20 500 MB plan would be dead on for most iPhone owners , I think — which is probably why it does n't exist . )

Rollover data would make AT&T 's argument that the new plans are about value — not simply strangling the most hardcore data users taxing the network — way more convincing , since it would make the plans address the issue of network capacity in a tangible way .
Unfortunately , it 's highly unlikely that AT&T is particularly interested in fairness , or at least in the idea of you actually using all the data you pay for .
AT&T senior VP of data and voice products Mark Collins ' response about why they 're charging $ 20 extra for the privilege of tethering says it all :
That capability is enabling something you can't do today .
You can use one device and get multiple connections so it 's more useful to you .
You 're going to use more data so the price is based on the value that will be delivered .
[ emphasis mine ]
Advertisement
That does n't make any sense at face value , because you 're paying for every byte of data you consume , and the tethering fee does n't give include additional data — it comes out of the 2GB you 're already paying for .
The subtext is that AT&T does n't actually expect most people to use that 2GB , and in fact , they do n't want you to — which is they make it more expensive to make it easier to use .
Look , I 'll pay per byte .
Just give me all the bytes I pay for .

The study used data on the distribution of galaxies
Scientists have made their most accurate measurement yet of the mass of a mysterious neutrino particle .
Neutrinos are sometimes known as " ghost particles " because they interact so weakly with other forms of matter .
Previous experiments had shown that neutrinos have a mass , but it was so tiny that it was very hard to measure .
Using data from the largest ever survey of galaxies , researchers put the mass of a neutrino at no greater than 0.28 electron volts .
This is less than a billionth of the mass of a single hydrogen atom , the scientists say .
Their nickname is fitting : a neutrino is capable of passing through a light - year ( about six trillion miles ) of lead without hitting a single atom .
It is remarkable that the distribution of galaxies on huge scales can tell us about the mass of the tiny neutrinos Professor Ofer Lahav , UCL
The results are to be published in the journal Physical Review Letters and will be presented at the Weizmann UK conference at University College London ( UCL ) this week .
" Back in 2002 , we put an upper limit on the neutrino mass of 1.8 electron volts .
So this is an improvement by a factor of six , " said co-author Professor Ofer Lahav , from UCL .
" It is remarkable that the distribution of galaxies on huge scales can tell us about the mass of the tiny neutrinos . "
The work resulted from the PhD thesis of UCL scientist Shaun Thomas , working with Professor Lahav and Dr Filipe Abdalla .
Scientists used the largest ever 3D map of galaxies in the Universe , based on data gathered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
Ocean waves
They were able to determine a new upper limit for the neutrino particle by analysing the distribution of galaxies across the Universe .
The matter in the cosmos naturally forms into " clumps " of galaxy groups and clusters .
As neutrinos are extremely light they move across the Universe at great speeds .
This has the effect of smoothing out the natural " clumpiness " of matter , the research team says .
Professor Lahav likens this to ocean waves smoothing out a pile of sand on a beach .
By analysing the extent to which this " smoothing - out " of galaxies has taken place , scientists were able to work out the upper limits of neutrino mass .
Professor Lahav believes neutrinos are a minor component of cold dark matter , the mysterious " stuff " which comprises some 25 % of the Universe and more than 80 % of matter in the Universe .
" The neutrino is squeezed into that slice [ of the Universe ] that is dark matter .
But it probably accounts for less than one percent of that dark matter , " he told BBC News .
The neutrino particle comes in three " flavours " : muon , tau and electron .
In a recent experiment , physicists caught a neutrino in the act of changing from one type to another .
Image caption The Minos experiment was set up to study neutrino oscillations
The finding by researchers on the Opera experiment in Italy provides a missing piece in the puzzle that has challenged scientists for decades .
In the 1960s , US scientist Ray Davis observed far fewer neutrinos arriving at the Earth from the Sun than models predicted .
Either the models were wrong , or something was happening to the neutrinos on their way .
A possible solution to the puzzle was provided in 1969 , when theorists suggested that chameleon - like oscillatory changes between different types of neutrinos could be responsible for the apparent deficit .
Several experiments have observed the disappearance of muon neutrinos , confirming the oscillation hypothesis .
But until the results from Opera , no observations of the appearance of a tau - neutrino in a pure muon - neutrino beam have been observed .
Another project , called Minos , recently reported results which point to a fundamental difference between neutrinos and their anti-matter counterparts , known as " anti-neutrinos " .
In the experiment , a beam of muon anti-neutrinos was fired from the Fermilab particle accelerator in Chicago through the Earth to the Soudan underground lab in Minnesota .
They found a relatively large difference in the way neutrinos and anti-neutrinos oscillated between one type and another .
This difference could not be explained by the established theory of particle physics , known as the Standard Model .

As a species , we like to think we make rational decisions .
More likely is that we pick comforting mental images and demand them from the world , then invent backward rationalizations for our actions and their unintended consequences .
Whenever you ’re on a project and things go wrong for you , it makes sense to stop what you ’re doing and re-trace your steps .
As part of that , you ’re going to eventually question the assumptions you made in approaching the project .
With the demise of the 20th century , we saw some of the roughest times for humanity fade away — except they ’re still here .
The last 100 years has been a time of the most radical change since humanity ’s inception , for us .
We ’ve had some great heights ( air travel , space flight , DNA , digital computing ) and also some great lows ( two world wars , genocides , dumbing down of culture ) .
Although the signs are still faint , there ’s evidence that our future may run into trouble .
Particularly , there ’s the troubling convergence of these factors :
Our population keeps growing .
Our politics keep getting more deceptive and corrupt .
Pollution keeps increasing .
We keep using more land for more humans .
With globalization and the loss of culture , the international corporations and big media keep getting more powerful .
Despite being liberal democracies , our governments have now become a form of “ soft fascism ” : the Nanny State .
Some uninformed people will tell you that “ slippery slope ” arguments , or the idea that letting one thing slide leads to more things sliding , are a logical fallacy .
To my mind it ’s more accurate to say that slippery slope arguments are often misapplied .
One area they ’re not is increase .
When laws requiring us to wear seatbelts were passed , we were told they were not going to be used as an excuse to pull over motorists and profit by ticketing them .
Can anyone claim that ’s the case anymore ?
Our population increases .
Our economies increase .
Each time we legalize some oddity , for example medical marijuana , the onrush of people forces the policy to expand even more .
Soon we ’re on that slippery slope .
This blog exists to question an important myth , which is that we are rational as a species .
We are not — mainly because it ’s unclear if we ’re ( a ) in charge of ourselves , in any meaningful sense and ( b ) actually intending the results of our actions .
To an informed observer , it seems more likely that we are reacting to changes in our reality , and striking back against it monkey - style with assertions of what we ’d like to believe .
Then to make ourselves sound competent , we invent as many rational reasons ( “ justification , ” “ rationalization ” ) as we can — thinking backward from effect to cause .
I ’m going to tackle a series of our big myths , starting in this post with the myth of our rationality itself .
But you can look forward to me tackling :
Equality
Consumerism
Diversity
Free speech
Profit motive
Eco-stewardship
Let the blood of sacred cows renew the grass beneath our feet which , we are surprised to find , exists independent of our conscious minds .

In addition to expunging the kids ' records , judicial leaders need to get moving on 43 reform recommendations from the Interbranch Commission on Juvenile Justice .
The panel 's report issued in late May calls for an overhaul of the juvenile - justice system to prevent a repeat of the scandal .
The proposals include assuring that juvenile defendants have lawyers , and that judges and other stakeholders in the legal community are held more accountable .
At least one Israeli - other than Shalom Hanoch whose signature is affixed to the title of this article ( taken from his song " Waiting for the Messiah " ) - has reached the conclusion that Israeli public opinion is dumb .
That person is the prime minister , and he is correct .
If Benjamin Netanyahu believes he can tell Israelis for years that the blockade of the Gaza Strip is a security need , an Israeli interest , and then on one ordinary day he can simply claim the exact , but the exact , opposite - that lifting the blockade is in Israel 's interest , a means of weakening Hamas and a recipe for securing the release of Gilad Shalit - then he clearly thinks the public is dumb .
( Even if his bureau now contends he had spoken out against the blockade , he of course never did a thing to lift it . )
If the Israeli public accepts all of Netanyahu 's initial claims with alarming apathy and blind obedience and then hastens to automatically adopt the exact opposite , then the prime minister is correct in his conclusion .
And if the public is not even insulted by its prime minister 's humiliating , disparaging and arrogant treatment of it , then indeed this is " an accident for the country " as the unfortunate policeman says to Artzieli the son , in the abovementioned song .
Take a look at what one rickety Turkish ship can do .
A partial suspension of the blockade on Gaza - partial , because the gates remain closed to exports and one and a half million people continue to be imprisoned - in one fell swoop revealed to us a series of depressing conclusions about ourselves .
The most depressing of all is that there is no public opinion and there is no government in Israel ; it is a state in receivership whose political decisions are taken from the outside .
Starting with the speech at Bar - Ilan University , and continuing on to the freezing of construction in the territories , the establishment of a committee of inquiry into the flotilla incident ( and even its composition ) , up to the easing of the blockade - all of these are imported decisions , made in America .
They are not blue and white .
Even the fate of King 's Garden ( Al - Bustan ) in the Silwan neighborhood of East Jerusalem will be decided in the U.S. State Department .
Therefore those who complain about people who turn to parties abroad and try to shake Israel up via international elements , who are labeled as " traitors , " would do well to remember that there is no where else to turn - Israel proves by its very own deeds that its fate will be decided from outside its borders .
Israel has also proven once again this week that " only by force " is its only language .
The blockade should have been lifted a long time ago and its lifting could have been presented as a daring Israeli initiative , as a humanitarian response to the needs of Gazans , as a positive declaration of intentions .
In this way , it would also have been possible to gain some credit among world and Palestinian public opinion .
But no , we will not ease the blockade unless they force us to do so .
And when the United States forced our hand , once again our decision could be seen as nothing else but an embarrassing Israeli capitulation .
So here we transmit the same message yet again , both to our friends and to our enemies :
Only by force .
Send yet another semi-violent flotilla , and the alleviation of the sanctions will be extended even further .
As chilling as it may sound , even just a few Qassam rockets could help us remember Gaza 's existence .
Above all :
The day the president of the United States decides to put an end to the Israeli occupation , the occupation will cease .
The public also accepts without question that it has a prime minister who never ever tells it the truth .
We 've never had a prime minister like Netanyahu , who never reveals what he 's thinking .
How does he really feel about the blockade ?
What he told us yesterday ?
What he is saying today ?
That is was not actually essential ?
That it was helpful ?
That it was harmful ?
Nor is anyone demanding of him that he express anything other than the spin intended to placate Washington .
The public is dumb , forgive me for the expression , because it accepts everything .
Blockade ?
Let there be a blockade .
No blockade ?
So there wo n't be one .
Until yesterday , we were told there was no blockade , today they tell the public that the blockade has been lifted - anything goes .
Anything goes in a society that has sunk to the depths of apathy , as if it were in a coma .
Could it be worse ?
Certainly .
There is still a generation here that remembers other periods in which there was leadership and an opposition and clear alternatives ; not like today .
There were days when ideological arguments took place , not like today ; days when civilian protests were staged , not like today .
The next generation will not know any of that .
For a generation fed by newspapers on trains and stupefying television , demanding that the leaders lead and the politicians speak the truth will soon sound like something out of musty history books .
But perhaps there is nothing bad without good .
Particularly as the trucks filled with Israeli goods pass through the crossing points , perhaps the blockade of our thoughts - which we brought upon ourselves - will also open up .
Having lost hope thanks to Netanyahu 's deceit and trickery , perhaps we will finally start to ask :
Where to ?
And why ?
 June 5 , 2010 -- Scientists who advised the World Health Organization on its influenza policies and recommendations — including the decision to proclaim the so - called swine flu a " pandemic " had close ties to companies that manufacture vaccines and antiviral medicines like Tamiflu , a fact that WHO did not publicly disclose .
The links between the advisors and the companies that make money from vaccines and flu treatments were detailed in a report published online by the British medical journal BMJ , which investigated the advisors ' role in WHO 's policy .
The report by Deborah Cohen , features editor of BMJ , and Philip Carter , a journalist with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in London , acknowledged that flu experts do " need to work with industry to develop the best possible drugs for illnesses , " but said that allowing industry experts to have a role in the formulation of public health policy was a slippery slope .
And worse , Cohen and Carter said , was the failure of WHO officials to disclose the conflicts of interest or even identify the members of its advisory committee .
In a statement , WHO 's secretary - general Margaret Chan , MD , MPH , said the purpose of keeping the committee members anonymous " is to protect the integrity and independence of the members while doing this critical work — but also to ensure transparency by publicly providing the names of the members as well as information about any interest declared by them at the appropriate time . "
And in the U.S. a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services defended WHO 's handling of the pandemic .
" The WHO handled the outbreak in a very measured and appropriate manner , " he said .
" Their decisions were driven by the existing and evolving conditions at the time and what the best scientific information was telling us .
It 's very easy to look back through a 20 - 20 lens and essentially be an armchair quarterback . "
Addressing the possibility of industry - influence on WHO 's decisions , the spokesman said , " The WHO based its decisions on strong public health considerations and I do n't think there was any indication from our perspective that their decisions were influenced by industry in any way . "
The H1N1 pandemic , which will mark its one - year anniversary on June 11 , " could , of course , have been far worse , " Cohen and Carter wrote .
" Planning for the worst while hoping for the best remains a sensible approach .
But our investigation has revealed damaging issues .
If these are not addressed , H1N1 may yet claim its biggest victim — the credibility of the WHO and the trust in the global public health system . "
And the medical journal was n't the only entity going on record with a critical assessment of WHO .
A report from the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly published on the same day the BMJ report was released called into question WHO 's handling of the H1N1 pandemic .
An official Council of Europe inquiry led by Paul Flynn , a British member of parliament , concluded that the " Parliamentary Assembly is alarmed about the way in which the H1N1 influenza pandemic has been handled , not only by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , but also by the competent health authorities at the level of the European Union and at national level . "
World Health Organization and H1N1 Flu
Flynn 's team stopped short of saying that WHO had bungled the pandemic , but did conclude that some of WHO 's actions led to the " waste of large sums of public money , and also unjustified scares and fears about health risks faced by the European public at large . "
Infectious disease specialists contacted by ABC News / MedPage Today agreed that the lack of disclosure was troubling , but there was little criticism of the WHO 's decision declare the worldwide H1N1 outbreak a pandemic , nor were there many knocks about WHO 's handling of the pandemic .
" I do find these investigations troubling , when the only way WHO could be exonerated is if there had been tens of millions dead , " said John Barry , a distinguished scholar at Tulane University and author of The Great Influenza .
" And then we'd have investigations about how ineffective they were . "
" While I agree WHO should have disclosed any relationship between advisors and industry , " he continued , " based on what WHO actually did , I find it absurd to accuse them of having been influenced by the drug industry .
Antivirals , though hardly a magic bullet , are the only drug option .
And a recommendation to stockpile them was the only option . "
John Bartlett , MD , founding director of the Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies at Johns Hopkins , echoed those sentiments .
That conflicts of interest are prevalent among influenza experts " is not at all surprising to me since the people in medicine who know most about flu are often conflicted because they also are advisors to pharma and often do the big trials that are funded by pharma . "
Bartlett said he was not an authority on influenza , but added , " The colleagues I know who do this work often / usually have these connections , but that is usually good for better pharma and good for better WHO advice . "
Addressing concerns that the pandemic was declared to profit pharmaceutical companies , Barry said that " if anything WHO was slow to make that call .
And if you know anything about the history of the influenza virus , again it had no option .
1918 saw a very mild spring wave , quite comparable to what we experienced in 2009 .
It turned virulent months later . "
" This is a classic case of 20 - 20 hindsight , with some witch hunting thrown in , " Barry said .
Dr. John Treanor , a vaccine expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center , in Rochester , N.Y. , agreed that WHO 's preparations were justified .
" I think even the authors [ of the BMJ report ] would have to agree that there really was no choice here but to prepare for a pandemic , " he said .
" If there had been a severe pandemic and there had been no preparations , the outcome ( and the outcry ) would have been far worse . "
World Health Organization and H1N1 Flu
Although some of the WHO 's advisors received compensation from manufacturers of the same antivirals and vaccines recommended for use during the H1N1 pandemic , Treanor noted that there are few options available for combating influenza .
" You can tweak the plans — how much antivirals , what kinds , where is the vaccine coming from , who should be vaccinated first , should you close schools , etc. — but the basic elements are going to be the same , " he said .
" So I do n't see the argument here as whether WHO made the right recommendation at the time , regardless of who was advising them — they clearly did . "
Arthur Reingold , MD , head of the division of epidemiology at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health and head of the California Emerging Infections Program , said , " WHO would have received identical advice [ regarding ] the need to stockpile antiviral drugs and speed the development of vaccines from any competent expert in the field without industry ties . "
But not all researchers were willing to give WHO a free pass on its handling of H1N1 .
Henry Miller , MD , a biotechnology expert at Stanford University 's Hoover Institution , said WHO made a number of mistakes , and its declaration of a pandemic was one of them .
That said , Miller added , " the stockpiling of anti-flu medicines and the production of vaccine were n't among [ WHO 's mistakes ] . "
Cohen and Carter detailed WHO 's pandemic influenza preparation starting in 1999 , when a preparedness plan was drafted by six researchers in collaboration with the European Scientific Working Group on Influenza ( ESWI ) .
Over the next decade , according to their investigation , WHO failed to disclose industry ties among researchers advising the organization .
The document drafted in 1999 did not include information on conflicts of interest .
Cohen and Carter pointed out that ESWI is funded entirely by Roche , which makes Tamiflu ( oseltamivir ) and that two of the authors of the document had participated in Roche - sponsored events in the previous year .
Both were also involved in a randomized controlled trial of Tamiflu supported by the company .
In 2002 , WHO called together flu experts to craft guidelines for the use of vaccines and antivirals during an influenza pandemic .
The panel included representatives of Roche and Aventis Pasteur ( now Sanofi - Pasteur ) , which makes flu vaccine , and three experts who had been named in marketing material for Tamiflu .
The resulting report , which advised stockpiling antivirals , was published in 2004 , and the main author , Frederick Hayden , MD , of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville , confirmed that Roche was paying him for lectures and consulting when the report was produced and published .
Several additions to the report did not include information about conflicts of interest , according to Cohen and Carter .
" WHO has failed to provide any details about whether such conflicts were declared by the relevant experts and what , if anything , was done about them , " they wrote .
Compounding this lack of transparency is the fact that the 16 members of the emergency committee that has been advising WHO during the H1N1 pandemic have remained anonymous , at least officially .
The chair is known to be John MacKenzie of Curtin University in Perth , Australia .
The BMJ investigation turned up another three members , including Arnold Monto , M.D. , of the University of Michigan School of Public Health ; John Wood , Ph.D. , of the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in the U.K. ; and Masato Tashiro , M.D. , Ph.D. , director of the WHO collaborating center for surveillance and research on influenza in Tokyo .
Wood and Tashiro said they have no conflicts of interest , but Monto has received speaker 's fees from GlaxoSmithKline , maker of another antiviral , Relenza ( zanamivir ) .
According to the University of Rochester 's Treanor , the important issue to consider is not whether WHO made the right decisions about the H1N1 pandemic — because he believes they made the right recommendations at the time — but " the much more tricky and generic question about how to appropriately separate the interests of the pharmaceutical industry from the interests of public health , while at the same time being able to take advantage of existing expertise on the issues , the bulk of which resides in individuals with some kind of ties to industry . "
" In our current system of healthcare , " Treanor said , " the responsibility for demonstrating that these interventions are safe and effective lies with the manufacturer .
Hence , individuals with the greatest experience and insight into these interventions will almost always either be employees of industry or individuals paid by industry to conduct studies . "
However , according to Philip Alcabes , associate professor of epidemiology at City University of New York Hunter College , investigations should go far beyond the question of whether potential links to drug companies went unpublicized .
" Even when nobody is directly in the pay of a corporation , policy decisions are too - often made by members of the Big Public Health party , " said Alcabes .
" H1N1 flu was a great example . "
When evaluating advice from a panel of experts , Treanor said it 's important to consider the fact that researcher 's will always view the products they do work on in a positive light , even if they were n't paid by industry .
" After all , " Treanor said , " it 's much more fun to be involved in the development of an effective product than one that does n't work . "
Finally , Dr. Donald A. Henderson , who served for three years as Director of the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness in the Bush administration and who is perhaps best known for his role in leading the effort to eradicate smallpox , brings the perspective of long experience to analysis of WHO 's handling of H1N1 .
Henderson , who is now a professor of medicine and public health at the University of Pittsburgh , agreed that too much antivirals were stockpiled and too many vaccines produced , and when that happens the body politic demands " someone or some organization must be blamed -- in this case , WHO has been named , and its policy of using experts who may not have disclosed possible relationships with relevant pharmaceutical companies .
However , WHO is not an authoritarian and all - knowledgeable body as witness the fact that a number of different countries ( e.g. USA , U.K. , Sweden , Canada and a number of others ) convened their own expert committees and reached different conclusions as to how much vaccine and antiviral products they would buy and policies for their use .
" So , why is WHO singled out ?
Each national body and expert group is more comfortable ascribing mistakes in strategy or policy to someone else .
WHO is a handy whipping post .
I would characterize this focus on WHO as a ' cheap shot . ' "

The Other Shore
An insight into my first experience with the entheogen 5 - methoxy - dimethyltryptamine ( most commonly known as 5 - MeO - DMT ) , a powerful tryptamine .
Objective analysis of the experience is complicated since the effects are volatile , and minimal dosage changes can induce violent differences .
Nonetheless , I hope this short essay will be useful to those interested on researching 5 - MeO - DMT beyond a purely scientific drive .
The substance was obtained in freebase powder form from the supplier , synthesized in Asia .
The chemical arrived tightly packed inside a sealed zip plastic bag , along an informational sheet , clearly labeled indicating the scientific denomination of the substance and its unsuitability for human consumption .
This is to comply with public health laws in the country of origin , and likely elsewhere .
The total net amount was 250 milligrams .
The physical appearance of 5 - MeO - DMT is a white crystal powder with distinct bitter smell and taste , intense and noticeable even if mixed with any other substance .
It vaporizes at a relatively low temperature , leaving a brown to black dark residue .
It is disgusting to insufflate , although in my experience it did n't cause any abnormal nasal drip , but the after taste and feeling in the throat is definitely unpleasant .
Because of its effects , the user will unlikely notice this after onset , much less during peak or afterwards .
With threshold doses it is definitely noticeable .
Mixed with other vapors , the taste and smell can be concealed , for example with tobacco .
This method of intake is n't recommended , though , since it is n't possible to have precise knowledge of the true amount of chemical being vaporized .
I was introduced to research chemicals by a good North American friend , who has experience with LSD and Psilocybin , and a single experience with 5 - MeO - DMT itself , among other span of substances including several prescription drugs ( CNS depressants , narcotic analgesics , et cetera ) .
Without previous experience with psychedelics , I was warned about the intensity of 5 - MeO - DMT , and the potentially unwise choice as a first experience .
It became evident that it could either drive me away from psychedelics altogether , or the complete opposite .
Nonetheless , the night of 4th July 2009 I was determined to try this tryptamine and prepared myself , while restless at 3:00 AM , to experiment its effects .
From the experiences I read online , and my friend 's advice , I realized it would be a likely extreme experience which could put my mind off limits and induce a deep state of trance , with the potential panic and terrifying dysphoria of near - death states .
As the reader might be able to understand in this report , this was accurate but unlikely to fully express the intensity of the experience .
It is world shattering , in several aspects .
I would , personally , advice any potential user of this drug to simply be psychologically prepared to let go , and surrender ego and control , and accept that , once its effects are in full motion , it is absolutely impossible to grasp any control of your own life and consciousness , feeling utterly helpless and in vulnerable awe .
It will be overwhelming .
It was 4th July of 2009 , at 3:00 AM .
A comrade ( to be referred as Subject B ) had gone out to a club at the beach and I received a call with the news : he was free for the rest of the night and did n't have anything better to do .
In the past few days I had commented about 5 - MeO - DMT , as well as introduced him to methylone ( an emphatogen , analogue of MDMA ) .
He had no experience with psychedelics whatsoever , and only did moderate , sporadic use of cocaine .
He is emotionally and intellectually immature , and definitely unfamiliar with any spiritual or philosophical aspects that tryptamines and other psychedelics have , and currently not capable of understanding the meaning of introspection .
He might seem like a clearly unsuitable ``sitter '' , and it was definitely impossible for him to grasp the purpose and true meaning of the substance , but nonetheless , experimenting with someone who is completely unaware and unsuspecting of its sheer power , while ethically questionable for some , remains as scientifically interesting .
No expectations means no disappointments .
Once Subject
B arrived , I decided to prepare doses using a somewhat reliable measurement reference , given the lack of a milligram scale .
The first dose would be taken through inhaling its vapors , via a syringe prepared for this purpose ( had its side opened wide and cut to allow full air flow ) and an aluminum spoon .
Aluminum foil would have been a more suitable option ( due to shorter heating time ) but this was unavailable at the time .
The second dose was to be insufflated .
The approximate doses were 10 - 12mg and 15 - 20 mg respectively .
I did insufflate a higher amount , albeit it is impossible to accurately calculate the difference .
In the report the reader will be able to discern my experience from that of my trip companion .
A comfortable sofa and low trip - hop music would provide the medium to relax and remain comfortable during the experience .
A small flex light was used to provide a smooth , less intense illumination for the room .
I prepared myself to inhale the vapors of an approximate 10 mg dose within an aluminum spoon .
After heating up the metal with a normal lighter and holding the syringe , I started breathing deeply as soon as the vapors started emerging from the melting crystals .
The smell struck intensely , it was mildly foul and unpleasant , bitter .
I instantly felt a rush and the room seemed to vibrate for moments , my heart rate subtly raised , and I lied on the sofa , waiting for the inevitable onset of a more intense experience .
I felt my body vibrate and my hands tremble with subtlety , I was confused if I could be the only one noticing this .
I embraced myself and decided to concentrate on whatever psychological and more transcendental effects were about to be unfold .
And then I lost perception of time and space , It was mild and inspiring awe .
I felt my mind was beginning to be unconscious of my body , and I was sweating but felt comfortable , even cold .
I could feel myself alienated from the room , the background music , the presence of a person there .
I was alone , in an extent of the word I had n't known before , even if I 'm a person who enjoys meditation and solitude .
I needed a more intense trip .
I could see there was much more waiting at the other side of wherever I was heading to .
I was n't as brave anymore , I knew something potentially terrible but admirable was waiting there .
For some reason , I remembered two occasions in my life when I almost drowned ; I did n't feel asphyxia , only the sensation of being helpless and out of control , watching my existence ending right there .
Still , I knew there was more to this .
I was n't convinced if it was the intensity I could expect from the substance , therefore I instantly became more determined to experiment a higher dose as soon as the effects would wear off .
How wrong was I , thinking it could be foolishly played with , but grateful to disregard the potential risks , leaving only fate to decide the outcome for the next dose through insufflation .
Subject B did n't understand the intention of the trip or purpose of the substance , therefore in the next subsection , only the shallow effects he experienced will be explained , before I proceed to describe , if even possible at all , my own experience with the insufflated dose .
This was it .
I was worried , concerned about what was truly beyond the outer limits of my mind and existence .
Was I truly empty in the inside ?
Are we part of a greater identity or energy ?
Are we just a bunch of meaningless life forms moving hysterically in some planet lost among the stars ?
Honestly , I was thinking it was negative to draw too many conclusions and theories beforehand .
I knew the unknown awaited me .
It was too late to turn back and walk away .
``Let the chips fall where they may .
'' Whether I was being more philosophical or spiritual than necessary was moot .
The white crystalline powder , so incredibly minuscule yet powerful and inspiring of respect and concern , was waiting on a metal cardboard .
An amount of approximately 10mg , the size of a match head .
As I instruct Subject B to forget about any expectations and simply concentrate to enjoy the experience , whatever it might be , I ask myself if It 's a good idea , and if he will be prepared to deal with any potential effects it might have on him , if it will shatter his world and identity in ways he wo n't be able to couple with .
Too late to turn back , never repent .
He snorts the tiny amount of powder and instantly feels displeased .
Subject B reports it is bitter , unpleasant to taste , and hurts .
While lying on the sofa , I instruct him to relax , and ask how he is feeling .
About 2 - 3 minutes post - insufflation , Subject B reports feeling a rush .
I notice his sight seems to be definitely changing .
He complains of the bad taste and hurting nose , and drinks a glass of water .
I observe and suggest to simply relax and try to overcome those feelings .
About 5 minutes post - insufflation , he starts staring in fixed places and grins , pointing to the ceiling and wall .
I avoid interfering , he seems to be having visuals of some type .
Subject B reports the walls are vibrating or moving , and the light in the ceiling seemed strange to him , he was unable to recall it was a light , and then was amused to find out what it was .
He remains silent in gaps , grinning and smiling .
I 'm glad he is enjoying it , and realize it might have been a threshold dose .
I talk to my North American friend over the Internet and confirm this .
Lacking a milligram scale is definitely suboptimal , I realize I will be doing a higher dose , while aware of the risks .
He has somewhat poor coordination .
The effect at 10 minutes seems to be wearing off , and it was definitely a mild experience for him .
At 15 minutes he is definitely capable of normal psychomotor operation .
Overall it seems he might be holding details of the experience to himself .
It 's time for me to proceed with the insufflated second dose .
I prepare approximately 15 - 20 mg of the powder , wondering if I will ever be the same again or come back .
I hold the syringe tube in my nose and insufflate the powder deeply , continuing to inhale any remains of the powder , as quickly as I could possibly can .
The feeling of its bitter taste and sensation in the nose strikes me .
It is surely unpleasant .
I drink a glass of water , and suddenly within 2 minutes , I start feeling my connection to the physical world is slowly fading away .
My eyes feel powerless , and I decide to lie in the sofa .
Lights go off .
That was it .
The beginning of the real end .
Onset : 2 minutes
At the moment of writing these words , it is still difficult to recall the immersion into the brutal experience I was entering , and Subject B was and would be oblivious to it .
This was a journey to Death , but the depths of my own mind .
My body vibrated and trembled much more noticeably to me than it did with the smoked first dose .
It was an incredible rush , I could feel blood traveling across my body , I could feel my nerves , my muscles , every single pore of my skin , every drop of sweat in my hands .
Blood felt like ice , I was entering some sort of sensorial coma , but I was still able to see and hear , even though it all seemed far away .
I close my eyes and feel like this had to end , I was parting ways from my existence as I knew it , and it was terrifying .
Plateau : 5 - 10 minutesI realized I had n't felt such fear ever before in my life .
It was true terror , but something made me feel comfortable .
There was no way out , no easy escape , no cheating .
I had to let go and accept any potential outcome , and so I did .
Gradually I was feeling cold and transported elsewhere , I felt my body was succumbing and my mind had been projected out of it into a void , some sort of space where my perception of time was no longer working or reliable .
Everything physical felt meaningless , there was true force there , a power the likes of something I had never seen before .
I started having flashbacks , thoughts of my life , the troubles and destruction I caused to the lives of different people , those who loved and hated me , the different decisions and my moral code , I became suddenly convinced this was an opportunity to reconsider several aspects of this all , and meditate over what was valuable and truly important in life .
It would be impossible to accurately determine the duration of the peak and its effects , my perception of time was severely disturbed and it could have been a lifetime , or a few minutes .
My blood still felt like solid matter , I felt like a puppet master moving my own strings , able to instruct my hands to clench and move , but not able to feel them or care at all .
Everything seemed connected in some way , and then I focused on looking inside .
I never really believed in love , and thought myself to be unable to feel it or even become truly affectionate .
In this regard , most experiences of psychedelics I 've read about , including those with 5 - MeO - DMT , mention a consciousness of an universal energy and love .
To me , it was interesting to see that , while I was n't capable of determining the full extent or implications of ``love ' ' as other beings see it , I was able to detect the energy and drive behind the actions of those who are fond of us at a deep level , beyond any shallow attractions or feelings .
Possibly the effects were wearing off after 30 minutes to an hour after the initial coming up , and I was still in an apparent state of coma , unable to feel my heart rate or breathing .
Letting myself go was a good decision , panicking would have been useless and ruined the experience .
Deeply within my mind I came to realize I would likely never be the same person again .
I was given a look at death , the opportunity to take a profound introspection , a journey to my life .
But I was slowly fading back to the physical existence .
Mixed feelings of being grateful to survive and still sorry to leave the higher plane of existence and consciousness .
I struggled to be able to bring the most of that ability to the world I had known for years .
The monologue of Kurtz in Apocalypse Now ( based in the ``Heart of Darkness ' ' novel by Joseph Conrad ) came to my mind : I had been shot with a diamond bullet straight through my forehead .
There would be no more time and energy wasting , I was convinced about what was the purpose of my existence .
At this point , any tribulation in the world seems unimportant and ridiculous , and everything remains in balance out of our perception .
As Shulgin described one of his own experiences once , ' here I gaze upon the entire universe ' .
Alexandrines of Angelus Silesius , XVII CenturyThe far most gleaming light of this world can be seenBest from the darkest place where thou hast ever been .
Who would believe this true ?
From darkness light is wrought , Life out of death , and Something out of Nought .
The sun sets all in motion , makes even the planets dance .
You are not part of all unless you too advance .
Truly , who all this world would accurately seeMust now Democritus , now Heraclitus be .
Man , all that you desire within you lies concealed ;
You simply have not wrought until it be revealed .
As sternly as thou wilt , bind me by thousand chains ; The true self that is I unfettered still remains .
That man is well entitled to bear the rank of kingsWho under own dominion his strength and senses brings .
The present point in time , to him who seeketh blissSeemeth much more prolonged than all the future is .
There 's nought to spur thee on ; thou art the turning wheel
That spins of its own force , nor any rest may steal .
To be alone is good .
Be not gregariousAnd thou wilt everywhere walk in a wilderness .
The unencompassed man , like immortality , Uninfluenced remains by all externity .
The world contains thee not ; a universe thou art , That with thee , in thyself so firmly holds thee barred .
The devil in his way is just as good as we .
The qualities he lacks ?
Will and serenity .
We are so well imbued with immortality , Whether we will or not , immortal we must be .
The wise man , when he dies , no cry for heaven makes .
He has but come from there before his spirit breaks .
I say that nothing dies ; rather , another lifeBy dying is bestowed , though it be lived in strife .
The world 's a battleplace , the wreathlet and the crownNot his who fears to fight , nor glory nor renown .
Death will I not acknowledge , although I died each hour , Each time would only place new life within my power .
Oh folly !
Man will strive for time unto his deathYet for eternity will never waste a breath !
The silkworm works and spins until it learns to fly .
For shame , that as thou art upon the earth dost lie !
In your desires I marvel day plays so great a roleSince I have never known a sunset in my soul .
Note : this section has been written 2 months and 13 days after the experience , and describes the alterations in visual and psychological perception , lucid dreaming and after effects , as well as a second experience with a threshold dose .
Shortly after the experience , in a span of approximately two weeks , I experienced vivid lucid dreams , with a highly unusual frequency and even more strange scenarios .
The only thing I could recall as being remotely similar are post-clinical doses of Modafinil , in the range of 300 to 400 milligrams in a single dose , before sleep .
These doses would awake me in the course of the next four to five hours , albeit feeling refreshed , like after a long , sound sleep .
The impact on heart rate was evident at times , although within healthy boundaries , and always easily controlled with Lorazepam , if necessary at all .
In contrast , 5 - MeO - DMT was absolutely different .
It was a neverending rollercoaster of vivid dreaming , while being aware and conscious of this state , fully able to recall even the most small detail with precision .
I would be able to sleep through the full eight hours cycle , even though the first day it was quite unnerving .
In regards to perception , the first two weeks felt like the awakening after a long term coma .
Everything seemed more alive than ever , even the smallest things .
It took time to become used to this higher level of awareness , and initially , it was extremely distracting and paranoid .
Insects were especially annoying in that sense , because of tracers .
Visually , I could focus on an object , sentient or not , and visualize the slightest movement , leaving a trace describing its trajectory from the origin to the new position .
It had no color nor real visual properties , it was just something you could feel .
It could be described as the ability to detect movement without complex processing , without reasoning , but mere visualization .
Breathing , the rush of blood in the limbs , the wind , the sound waves , my own heart rate and internal organs .
Suddenly , I also felt more alive than ever , a synchronization of body and mind the likes I had n't seen or cared to perceive before .
The thought of being able to instruct my heart to stop and be concerned that it would actually do so , came to my mind .
The boundaries between what I once perceived as real and surreal got blurred beyond repair .
Now there was an ordinary reality , and something else , inhuman , right there .
Recently I decided to experience with a minimum threshold dose , smoked mixed with tobacco .
Possibly less than 10 milligrams .
The now familiar ' bliss ' came back , that characteristic force , feeling like you are being shot through a space cannon .
A state of introspection and focus , but also unconditional love for the mere being .
Albeit of less intense nature , I was able to appreciate the sense of detachment and time lost its widely accepted , yet mistaken , linear nature .
That day I decided to experiment with a dose of 200 milligrams of Modafinil , and the lucid dreaming was back at full motion .
There are other effects I 've been noticing lately , perception - wise , but it is extremely difficult to describe them with words .
These include psychological changes , namely a more objective perception of feelings and emotions in one self and other people , which is both positive and negative since it involves a degree of detachment from people , which some might consider dangerous or conflictive .
Immediately after the peak , during the experience with the second dose , a clear image came to my mind .
It was n't a reflection resulting from any complex pattern of thought or consideration .
It simply appeared , straight out of that inexplicable nowhere , the void , which I had just experienced .
I could see myself , at the side of a seemingly large river , without any surroundings , nor capable of seeing its beginning or end .
Then , at the other side , I could see myself as well .
A difference emerged , something lead me to realize it was the person , my ego , before I was taken to the void .
It was my old self .
I could n't swim there , I was standing still , unable to move , speak or react in any way .
And suddenly , doubt and confusion came to me , while in absolute awe , feeling out of control and helpless .
I was n't convinced if I wanted to meet me at the other side .
Was it truly meant to happen that way ?
Did I want to come back ?
Would I ever be the same person ?
Absolute uncertainty .
Forget about those worries of losing your money to a sinking economy , a disastrous legal and social system , a corrupted justice and society , a world of shallow perceptions .
It was my identity , my ego .
I was alone , my existence isolated in one place in the middle of a void , in nowhere .
It was terrifying but beautiful at the same time , the only certain thing , if it even mattered at all , was that , if I ever came back to what I knew before , I would never forget this moment in my whole life .
The rest was all uncertainty .
I knew it was hopeless to fall in despair , to cry out for help or panic .
I decided to let go , I lost all hope and then I realized that was freedom .
Pure and crystalline .
Genius .
There 's no empirical procedure , no mathematical model , no absolute truth or explanation , which can express what I felt there , so terrifying , overwhelming and world shattering , but beautiful and joyous , existential .
Now I try to meditate and consider what the river meant , the depths .
In all honesty , I realized that , had the dose been higher , instead of standing still at the side of the river , I would have stepped into the water , driven by an external force and command , and possibly be transported in a whirlwind to a point of no return .
This is the only hope for the next experiment with this amazing and mysterious tryptamine .
I do n't feel like experimenting with it again in the short term , not because of the fear and panic , of the loss of control and identity , but because it will take time and meditation to fully understand its power and consequences .
I do n't feel the need for another trip , but I 'll be looking forward to take myself to the next level and let myself go , and experience whatever is beyond this world of shallow perceptions .
I miss the feeling of being shot through an enormous Einstein - Rosen bridge into the outer Universe , and see its energy and power , that overwhelming stimuli for the senses .
To look at the world beyond time and space .
Above everything , immutable and incorruptible .
After spending quite some time looking for an answer to this vision quest of sorts , I came across the concept of the Higan in Buddhism .
My American friend was quick to provide an array of references to read , and so I did .
Higan means ' the other shore ' , and hence the title of this section ( originally ' The River ' ) .
It 's an euphemism for the Enlightenment , meaning ' One crosses from this shore of ignorance and suffering to the other shore of Enlightenment and peace ' .
How , without any previous knowledge nor memory ( including what is known as a cryptomnesia or memory bias of any kind ) I could have a vision of this concept , escapes my understanding .
I have no explanation , but I 've seen enough to refuse thinking it 's just a coincidence .
Hopefully , 5 - MeO - DMT wo n't have any true detrimental effects to physical health .
Even in the face of potential adversity caused by this chemical , I assume the responsibility and consequences of my decision to experiment with this and other research chemicals .
I might as well die of cancer , in a car accident , parachuting , shot or overdosing on routine and procrastination .
Either way , we are all doomed anyhow .
Last March General David Petraeus , then head of Central Command , sought to undercut his own testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee that was critical of Israel by intriguing with a rightwing writer to put out a different story , in emails obtained by Mondoweiss .
The emails show Petraeus encouraging Max Boot of Commentary to write a story – and offering the neoconservative writer choice details about his views on the Holocaust :
Does it help if folks know that I hosted Elie Wiesel and his wife at our quarters last Sun night ?!
And that I will be the speaker at the 65th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camps in mid-Apr at the Capitol Dome …
Petraeus passed the emails along himself through carelessness last March .
He pasted a Boot column from Commentary ’s blog into in an " FYI " email he sent to an activist who is highly critical of the U.S. ’s special relationship with Israel .
Some of the general ’s emails to Boot were attached to the bottom of the story .
The activist , James Morris , shared the emails with me .
The tale :
Back on March 13 , Mark Perry broke the explosive story that Gen. David Petraeus was echoing Joe Biden ’s view that the special relationship with Israel is endangering Americans .
Perry said that Petraeus had sent aides to the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the White House to tell him that the U.S. ’s inability to stand up to Israel was hurting Americans across the Middle East .
Perry reported that Petraeus was asking that Israel and Palestine be included under his Central Command ( rather than under Europe , as they are now ) .
On March 16 , neocon Max Boot , who is on the Council of Foreign Relations and holds militarist pro-Israel views ( he ’s an American Jew born in Russia ) , sought to refute Perry ’s post at the Commentary blog :
" I asked a military officer who is familiar with the briefing in question and with Petraeus ’s thinking on the issue to clarify matters .
He told me that Perry ’s item was ‘ incorrect . ’ "
Boot quoted the unnamed officer at some length apologizing for Israel :
he did not suggest that Petraeus was mainly blaming Israel and its settlements for the lack of progress .
They are , he said , “ one of many issues , among which also is the unwillingness to recognize Israel and the unwillingness to confront the extremists who threaten Israelis . ”
That ’s about what I expected : Petraeus holds a much more realistic and nuanced view than the one attributed to him by terrorist groupie Mark Perry .
I suspect this unnamed officer was Petraeus himself– based on the emails .
But we ’ll get to them in a minute .
That same day , Tuesday , March 16 , Petraeus testified before Congress , and on Thursday the 18th , MJ Rosenberg at Media Matters wrote a piece celebrating Petraeus ’s realist views on Israel / Palestine .
He noted that Petraeus is spoken of as a Republican candidate for President and contrasted Petraeus ’s views to Sarah Palin’s .
On March 19 , Morris sent Petraeus an email congratulating him on his views on Israel / Palestine .
And the same day , Petraeus responded to Morris with one word , " FYI " , and the Commentary piece by Boot .
The commanding general obviously did n’t realize it , but his copy of the Commentary piece was pasted in above his email correspondence with the author , Max Boot , and Gfoeller .
On March 20 , James Morris wrote back to Petraeus to try and engage some more .
This time Petraeus sent him this note :
" Thanks , James .
Frankly , I ’d like to let all this die down at this point , if that ’s possible !
All best -"
Morris wrote back , " I understand , but please keep in mind ( which I am sure you do anyway ) the consequences if the Israel lobby is successful in getting US into another war for Israel with Iran .
Also please keep in mind that your staff was spot on with what was conveyed in that posture report … . "
James Morris first shared the exchange with me in May .
My bad ; I did n’t read it .
Then after the McChrystal blow - up last week , he bugged me in his subject line , Did you read my exchange with Petraeus , and this time I had a look .
Two activists of the Popular Front of India ( PFI ) were arrested on Monday in connection with the attack on a professor at Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam district .
Sources said 12 others , most of them with extremist links , were also taken into custody for interrogation .
Ashraf , 37 , of Mundeth , Mekalady , and Jaffar , 28 , of Eramaloor , Kothamangalam , were remanded to judicial custody by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court , Muvattupuzha .
The right palm of T.J. Joseph , 53 , professor of Malayalam in the Newman College , Thodupuzha , was chopped off by the assailants on Sunday .
He , along with his mother and sister , was returning home from church when a gang of six waylaid his car and attacked him with an axe .
Professor Joseph underwent two lengthy micro-vascular surgeries at the Specialists Hospital , Kochi , and the severed palm was ‘ reconstructed and re-grafted ' .
Hospital sources said he was conscious and that his condition was stable .
He is recovering in the intensive - care unit .
Professor Joseph has been under suspension following a controversy over disparaging remarks about religious beliefs in an examination question paper he prepared for undergraduate students in the college .
A team led by Muvattupuzha Deputy Superintendent of Police Sabu Mathew is probing the attack .
T. Vikram , Superintendent of Police , Ernakulam Rural , who was camping in the area , said : “ We have talked to church leaders to convince them that an all - out effort is being made to nab the culprits . ”
Meanwhile , the Muslim Aikya Vedi took out a march to the Muvattupuzha police station claiming that its activists did not have any role in the attack .
Police presence was intensified at Muvattupuzha and Thodupuzha .
The attack has caused widespread shock and outrage across Kerala .
Several organisations , cutting across political and religious divides , have condemned it and called for stern steps to prevent recurrence of such incidents .
Many Muslim organisations , including the Indian Union Muslim League , condemned the attack and urged the government to take action against the culprits .
After the controversy over the question paper arose , Prof. Joseph was arrested for allegedly fomenting communal disturbances .
In the question paper , he had used a passage about an imaginary dialogue between God and Muhammad , and the students were asked to comment .
Certain Muslim organisations , assuming that ‘ Muhammad ' in the passage was Prophet Muhammad , took offence and staged protest rallies and clamoured for action against the professor .
Stones were thrown at the college run by the Christian church .
The college management apologised and , on the government 's instruction , Prof .
Joseph was placed under suspension for a year .
The police registered a case against him .
He went into hiding , but after a couple of weeks he was arrested under Section 295 of the Indian Penal Code ( for causing communal hatred ) .
He was later released on bail .
Freddy Patel to appear before disciplinary panel of GMC , which has power to strike him off register
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The pathologist whose initial examination suggested that Ian Tomlinson died of a heart attack during the G20 protests in London is facing accusations that he conducted four other autopsies incompetently .
Dr Mohmed Saeed Sulema Patel , known as Freddy Patel , will appear this week before a disciplinary panel of the General Medical Council , which has the power to strike him off the professional register .
The identities of the deceased in the postmortem examinations have not been disclosed in advance of the hearing , but they do not include Tomlinson because his case is under active consideration by the Crown Prosecution Service .
It is possible that the four autopsies relate to fewer than four deaths , because more than one examination is sometimes performed on a body .
Patel has performed autopsies in contentious cases in London for two decades , some involving deaths in police custody .
Tomlinson , 47 , a newspaper seller , was allegedly assaulted by police during the G20 protests in the City of London in April 2009 .
He had been walking home from work when he was confronted by officers .
The incident was captured on video and broadcast on the Guardian 's website .
No officer has been charged in relation to Tomlinson 's death .
The CPS has been considering a file sent to it by the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) since last August .
Patel concluded Tomlinson had had a heart attack , implying his death was unrelated to any injuries sustained when he fell on to the pavement .
A second autopsy , commissioned by the IPCC , found the cause of death was more likely to be abdominal bleeding – an injury consistent with a fall or assault .
Tomlinson 's death triggered complaints about excessive police force and highlighted concern over the independence of coroners ' investigations .
Patel 's professional record and findings were the subject of severe criticism at the time .
Another of the high - profile deaths for which Patel carried out an autopsy was that of Sally White , 38 , whose body was discovered locked in a bedroom in the Camden flat of Anthony Hardy , a 52 - year - old alcoholic with psychiatric problems .
The case was treated as suspicious until Patel detailed the cause of death as a heart attack .
Hardy went on to kill Elizabeth Valad , 29 , and Brigette MacClennan , 34 .
Patel 's medical work is already restricted .
He has been suspended from the Home Office register of accredited forensic pathologists and barred from carrying out postmortem examinations in " suspicious death " cases .
Patel , who qualified as a doctor initially at the University of Zambia in 1974 , was registered to practise in Britain in 1988 .
In 1999 he was disciplined by the GMC after discussing , outside an inquest hearing , the medical history of Roger Sylvester , who died in police custody .
He told reporters : " I am aware from the medical records held at Whittington hospital that Mr Sylvester was a user of crack cocaine . "
Sylvester 's family were devastated by the claim and denied that he been a user .
The advance GMC notice of this hearing says that its fitness to practise panel will " inquire into allegations that , whilst working as a consultant forensic pathologist , Dr Mohmed Patel 's conduct in carrying our four postmortems was irresponsible … "
It adds that itwas " not of the standard expected of a competent Home Office registered forensic pathologist and that in one case his conduct was liable to bring the profession into disrepute " .
Deborah Coles , of the charity Inquest , said : " This [ GMC ] case raises two important questions : how robust is the decision - making process adopted by coroners when instructing pathologists , and what checks and balances exist to deal with concerns about an individual pathologist 's conduct in contentious cases . "
Patel has previously defended his work .
" As far as I know , my findings [ in the White case ] stand as they were , and I was n't criticised , " he said last year .
He declined to comment about the hearing .
" I ca n't say anything , " he said .
MLITA , Lebanon —
A young boy ducks under a barricade to have his photo taken next to an Israeli tank .
A father puts his baby daughter ’s hand on the trigger of a piece of artillery .
A Shiite sheikh , in full religious dress , strolls past a map of “ Occupied Palestine . ”
Two women silently sob at the site where former Hezbollah leader Abbas al - Musawi , now dead , was said to have prayed .
It ’s opening day at Hezbollah ’s war museum in the southern Lebanese town of Mlita .
Museum construction is n’t finished yet — workers are still putting a cafeteria together and the gift shop lies empty — but Hezbollah officials opened it anyway to mark the 10 - year anniversary of Israel ’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon .
“ The Israeli forces occupied those hills , ” said museum tour guide Abu Ahmed , who said he was under orders not to give his full name .
“ The hurricane of the resistance attacked the eight Israeli teams and drove them into the abyss . ”
In fact , the museum ’s centerpiece is an exhibit called “ The Abyss . ”
It ’s a cratered area , surrounded by a ramp for visitors , covered with overturned Israeli tanks and leftover Israeli munitions .
Planning for the museum began in 2006 .
It now sits on a hilltop that served as a main staging ground for Hezbollah operations against Israel .
On opening day recently , the museum was jammed with supporters of the militant group .
Many carried green and white Hezbollah flags .
Others wore Hezbollah hats .
Traffic was clogged a mile down the country road with cars of revelers .
“ Today is the liberation day , ” said Abu Ahmed , referring to the national holiday marking the anniversary of the Israeli withdrawal , “ like the Fourth of July ! ”
Behind “ The Abyss , ” visitors are welcome to walk through the forested area where Hezbollah forces based their operations against Israel .
Wandering down the path , visitors see a mock up of a Hezbollah field hospital , a tribute to suicide bombers , and an elaborate cave system where fighters lived , prayed , and planned operations .
Another exhibit was designed to show off the extent of Hezbollah ’s arsenal , with rocket launchers and anti-tank systems on display .
For Lebanon ’s beleaguered south , which has been on the front lines of wars , both civil and international , for generations , this was a rare day of celebration .
The set up of the museum fed that sense of festiveness , showing off the might of the militant group that is a pariah in the eyes of many in the West .
“ I feel proud because what ’s done here is for the sake of the people living here , ” said one visitor , Mohammed Jammoul , standing in front of a poster with the images of Israel ’s leadership .
“ Israel is our enemy .
We dream of hitting her with every single weapon we have . ”
The museum displays paint a picture of Hezbollah as a powerful fighting force , rather than a scrappy militia .
In many ways , Hezbollah has matured since the days when it would launch small - scale missions against the Israeli military in the 1990s .
Along with its allies , it is now a dominant force in Lebanon ’s electoral politics .
Hezbollah leaders can be heard often on television bragging about the increased reach of the group ’s arsenal .
There is little mention of the great imbalance that still exists between Israeli military capabilities and Hezbollah ’s more modest abilities .
Despite a celebratory air , the museum opened with the threat of renewed violence hanging heavily over the event .
Last month , Israeli officials accused Syria of supplying Hezbollah with scud missiles .
On the weekend of the opening , Israel carried out a massive military drill just over the border , during which Hezbollah said it was going on high alert .
Whether there will be another war this summer has become a favorite topic of speculation among many Lebanese .
Still , though , officials seemed determined to used the event to look backward at the militant group ’s past accomplishments .
“ We chose this museum to refresh the memory of the other Lebanese of the resistance , ” said Sheikh Ali Daher , a Hezbollah spokesman .
“ To our people , this day signals the day of dignity , the day that all people stood together for their liberty . ”
The main indoor exhibition hall was designed to educate visitors about Israel — albeit with a Hezbollah slant .
A photo of Israeli soldiers in tears topped a poster with facts about the Israeli military .
Another poster showed satellite images of major Israeli cities .
Tour guide Abu Ahmed boasted that the poster illustrated the depth of Hezbollah ’s knowledge about its enemy .
Several minutes on Google Earth would yield the same set of images .
Outside the main indoor exhibition area , visitors can climb a set of stairs and enjoy a commanding view of the surrounding area .
From that vantage point , Rami Hassan , a museum guide who pointedly noted his willingness to give his full name , gazed off in the direction of Israel .
“ I do n’t see Israel , ” he said , smiling .
“ I only see Occupied Palestine . ”
Editor 's note :
In the fourth century B.C. , Alexander the Great forged a path from Greece through the modern Middle East to Persia .
It was a path of conquest that empires would follow through the ages .
Traces of each can be seen today in the culture , monuments , continuing military presence and people along the route , which ended for Alexander in Babylon , in modern - day Iraq .
In this project , GlobalPost correspondent Theodore May sets out to see how Alexander ’s influence lives on .
He will be blogging about his travels at Backpacking to Babylon .
Why did n't Netanyahu stay in US ?
It turns out Obama did n’t want him to use the White House as a stage to present Israel ’s side of the story .
In the hubbub surrounding the “ battle of the flotilla , ” Netanyahu ’s quick reversal of his decision to remain in the United States has been largely ignored .
It turns out that Obama told him to leave because he did n’t want Netanyahu to use the White House as a stage on which to present Israel ’s side of the story .
The flotilla violence caught Netanyahu in the midst of a diplomatic trip to North America .
He was in the Canadian capital of Ottawa at the time , about to leave for Washington for a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama .
The meeting was to have been a way for Obama to make up for the humiliation he dealt Netanyahu on his last visit , when he refused to be seen with the Israeli leader in public .
Netanyahu announced immediately after the flotilla news broke that he would remain in North America and would meet with Obama as scheduled .
However , within minutes after media reported Netanyahu would continue with his trip as scheduled , he abruptly announced a change of plan and set off immediately for Israel to “ deal with the flotilla crisis . ”
Behind the scenes , it was Obama officials who caused the turnabout .
Globes cites sources in both Jerusalem and Washington who say that Obama officials gave a clear message to Netanyahu ’s people : “ Do n’t come . ”
Officials in both Washington and Jerusalem deny that this was the case .
Some sources said that it was precisely the high - profile nature of the visit that scared the Americans .
The White House did not wish Obama to be seen sharing the stage with the leader of the country that was under international attack for having “ attacked peace activists . ”
Netanyahu , for his part , was looking forward to explaining to the world from Washington that the violent activists on the boat in question were “ terror activists ” with ties to Hamas and Al - Qaeda , who attempted to lynch the minimally - armed soldiers as they rappelled down down their helicopter .
ATLANTA -- University of Georgia athletic director Damon Evans repeatedly referred to his position at the school before his arrest on a drunken driving charge and asked the patrol officer if there was " anything you can do without arresting me , " according to a police report released Friday .
Evans told the Georgia State Patrol officer several times he was the school 's athletic director before he was arrested late Wednesday and charged with DUI and failure to maintain a lane , according to the report .
Also arrested with him was 28 - year - old Courtney Fuhrmann , who was charged with disorderly conduct .
Georgia athletic director Damon Evans apologized for his DUI arrest in a news conference Thursday .

" I am not trying to bribe you but I am the athletic director of the University of Georgia , " Evans said , according to the officer identified in the report as M. Cabe .
The officer also said that Evans asked to be taken to a motel instead of jail or to be let off with a warning .
According to the report , Evans later said : " I am not trying to bribe you , but is there anything you can do without arresting me ? "
In the report , the officer noted he found a " red pair of lady 's panties between [ Evans ' ] legs . "
When he asked Evans , a 40 - year - old married father of two children , what he was doing with the underwear , Evans said : " She took them off and I held them because I was just trying to get her home , " according to the report .
Evans told the officer that Fuhrmann was nothing more than a friend , according to the report .
But the officer said that Fuhrmann later told him that the two had been seeing each other for " only a week or so . "
" Just to let you know , it will be erased because he is the athletic director of UGA and he has that power , " Fuhrmann told the officer , according to the report .
She was charged with disorderly conduct after police said she repeatedly ignored warnings to stay inside the 2009 BMW while the trooper was conducting the field sobriety test and later acting " combative " in the back seat of the patrol car , according to the report .
" I apologize and do n't want to use my influence but she is trying to protect me , " the officer said Evans told him .
Fuhrmann told the Associated Press on Friday the charges against her are a " misunderstanding from what the media is portraying it as " but declined to speak further .
Evans and his attorney Steve Weiner did not immediately return calls seeking comment , but Evans apologized for the incident during a news conference in Athens on Thursday and said he " failed miserably . "
" My behavior and my actions are not indicative of what we teach our student athletes , " he said .
" My actions have put a black cloud over our storied program . "
School president Michael Adams said in a statement Thursday he was extremely disappointed , but will not decide on disciplinary measures until there is a full review by the university staff and legal office .
A UGA spokesman declined to comment Friday on the allegations in the police report .
A bleary - eyed Evans told the officer he drank two vodka martinis at a restaurant and another at a nearby bar , according to the report .
The officer noted that Evans had " red , bloodshot , watery eyes and droopy eyelids " and that he fumbled through his cards and dropped some of the items before he handed over his license .
" I feel pretty good , " he told the officer , before laughing for no apparent reason , according to the report .
The trooper said Evans later told him : " We go through life and we all drink and jump in a car . "
Evans -- a former Georgia football player -- became head of the athletic department in 2004 , replacing Vince Dooley , who was forced to step aside after a nasty spat with Adams .
Dooley had been at the school for 40 years , including 25 years as athletic director .
Evans became the Southeastern Conference 's first black athletic director and immediately shook up the department .
He bolstered the department 's bottom line but also reduced the number of associate and assistant athletics directors and fired three of Dooley 's longtime lieutenants .
He was the public face of the school 's athletic department , and starred in a taped message played at every home football game that urges fans not to drive under the influence .
" If you drink and drive , you lose , " he says .
Evans , who is set to appear in Atlanta Municipal Court on July 12 , was arrested minutes before a new five - year contract extension that raised his annual pay to $ 550,000 was to take effect .
By the time he was escorted to the Atlanta jail , the officer said in the report , Evans began to " cry uncontrollably . "

One of our alleged sources , a young US intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , has been detained and shipped to a US military prison in Kuwait , where he is being held without trail .
Mr. Manning is alleged to have acted according to his conscious and leaked to us the Collateral Murder video and the video of a massacre that took place in Afghanistan last year at Garani .
The Garani massacre , which we are still working on , killed over 100 people , mostly children .
Mr. Manning allegedly also sent us 260,000 classified US Department cables , reporting on the actions of US Embassy 's engaging in abusive actions all over the world .
We have denied the allegation , but the US government is acting as if the allegation is true and we do have a lot of other material that exposes human rights abuses by the United States government .
Mr. Manning was allegedly exposed after talking to an unrelated " journalist " who then worked with the US government to detain him .
Some background on the Manning case :

[ WARNING : giant insect picture . ]
This is now the third in our series of amazing animal facts .
If you have n’t already seen our others be sure to check them out .
Here we present 15 more interesting , and sometimes bizarre , facts about the animal kingdom .
Be sure to mention your own favorites that are missing from this list in the comments .
Here are the first two lists :
10 Amazing Animal Facts
Another 10 Amazing Animal Facts
1 Facts 1 – 5
1 . The tuatara ( pictured above ) is a lizard - like creature endemic to New Zealand , and it is thought to have existed for at least 200 million years ( if you believe in evolution , or 6,000 years if you believe in special creation ) .
The most fascinating aspect of tuataras is their third eye – complete with lens , cornea , rods and nerve tissue connecting it to their brain .
This suggests that the eye was a fully functioning eye in times gone by .
By six months of age the eye is covered by scales .
Pictured above is a baby tuatara .
Tuataras are the only remaining species of the sphenodontia genus .
2 . Another fascinating fact about ants is that some species send their queen into neighboring nests , where she will bite the head off the resident queen and begin laying her own eggs to take over .
3 . On average , sharks kill 10 humans every year .
But here is the thing : approximately 100 people die each year when they are stepped on by cows .
Remember that next time you are in a field of cattle .
4. Woodpeckers slam their heads into wood at a rate of 20 pecks per second .
What protects them from injury is a spongy area that sits behind their beaks and acts as a shock absorber .
5 . In the seventeenth century , when anti-Catholicism and anti-papacy was rife throughout the puritan world , puritans would stuff wicker effigies of the Pope with live cats and then set it on fire – taking much glee in the screaming anguish of the poor cats .
2 Facts 6 – 10
6 . Unlike most animals , the word for butterfly in European languages do not resemble each other .
In German it is schmetterling , in French it is papillon , in Spanish it is mariposa , in Italian it is farfalla , in Dutch it is vlinder , and in portuguese it is borboleta .
7 . To vomit , some frogs spew out their entire stomach , rinse it off with their right hand , and then push it back in .
8 . The hoatzin ( pronounced watseen ) bird is a vegetarian which , due to its strict vegetable diet , has stomachs similar to a cows to help it digest .
The need for large amounts of food makes these birds very heavy , and consequently bad fliers .
The rather beautiful bird is pictured above .
9 . Manatees have two teets beneath their forelimbs , which is very likely to be the cause of the many tales of mermaids heard around the world in the days of great sea voyages .
10 .
Here is one for all the animal rights activists .
The giant tortoise was often killed for its delicious oil , which was considered by the Dutch the only way to make the flesh of the now extinct Dodo bird palatable .
The flesh of the giant turtle is sufficient to feed several men and virtually every part of it is a taste sensation ( including the bone marrow and eggs ) .
3 Facts 11 – 15
11 . Tappen is the name given to a plug made of leaves , resin and fat which bears prepare and insert into their rectum prior to their three months winter dormition .
This is to stop insects from intruding and laying their eggs .
12 . An ant chamber can be up to 10 feet deep .
Each chamber within the vast network is designed for a different task .
The bottom chamber is for eggs , while others are for larvae , the queen , new queens and food storage .
13 . Bats manage to hang upside down with ease because their claws lock on to the branch or object from which they hang .
When a bat dies like this , it stays in place with its toes locked .
14 . The double headed Eagle symbol of the byzantine empire has a special meaning .
One head symbolizes old Imperial Rome , and the other symbolizes Constantinople , the capital of the Byzantine empire , and colloquially known as the New Rome .
15 .
The giant weta is a New Zealand insect which can grow a body ( excluding legs ) to the size of a mouse .
It is also , on average , heavier than a sparrow .
It is rather a horrifying looking creature , but unlike its also quite large relatives which are found all over New Zealand , the giant weta is confined to small islands .
The picture above shows an adult human holding a weta , which gives a good indication of its size .
Wetas are harmless and only bite when in danger .
( NaturalNews )
A civil rights lawyer is threatening to sue the Texas Department of State Health Services for secretly handing over genetic data on 800 newborns to the U.S. military for a law enforcement database .
Jim Harrington , director of the Texas Civil Rights Project , only recently settled a lawsuit with the department for collecting the DNA in the first place without parents ' consent .
After it became known that hospitals were taking blood samples from the heels of newborn infants and storing them indefinitely , Harrington and four parents took the state to court over unlawful search and seizure .
The case was settled when the department agreed to destroy 5.3 million blood samples .
After the case became public , the Texas Legislature passed a law requiring health workers to inform parents before taking such blood samples , giving them a chance to opt out .
According to Harrington , the Department of Health Services never admitted during negotiations that any off - site use had been made of the blood samples .
" I can't tell you how many times we sat there , and they said no law enforcement , " Harrington said .
" They said , ' It 's only about medical research , it 's only about medical research . " " This is the worst case of bad faith I have dealt with as a lawyer , " he said .
Recently , however , thediscovered information on the department 's web site indicating that 800 of the samples had been sent ( without identifying information ) to the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory database project .
The genetic material might help identify " ethnic or ancestral origins of unidentified corpses using mitochondrial DNA , " said department spokesperson Carrie Williams , defending the decision to participate in the program .
" We believed it was an important research project that could potentially help in missing persons cases .
" Regarding why no one was notified that DNA collected without consent was being sent to the military , she said , " We do n't publicize every agency initiative or contract , and obviously this is a sensitive topic .
" Harrington has threatened another lawsuit unless the samples are destroyed .

Im Verhältnis zu früheren Katastrophen wie Eschede oder Brühl sind die Pannen bei der Deutschen Bahn am Wochenende noch glimpflich verlaufen .
Zum Glück gab es beim Ausfall der Klimaanlagen in drei ICE - Zügen keine Todesfälle .
Doch erneut bringen technische Pannen das Staatsunternehmen in Schwierigkeiten .
Die Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt wegen des Verdachts der fahrlässigen Körperverletzung und unterlassener Hilfeleistung .
Pro Bahn spricht von Systemproblem
Ursachen können vielfältig sein
ICE 2 ist unzuverlässiger als der Vorgänger
Notfallfenster wären technisch möglich
Die Ursache für die Ausfälle ist bisher unklar .
Die Bahn erklärt nur , dass nun nach jeder Wartung und Reparatur noch ein Extrablick auf die Klimaanlage geworfen werde .
Dem Fahrgastverband Pro Bahn liegen nach eigenen Angaben Berichte über den Ausfall von Klimaanlagen in allen ICE - Baureihen vor .
„ Wir hatten am Montag viele Eingaben von Fahrgästen , die über konkrete Vorfälle in allen Baureihen und Zuggattungen berichten “ , sagte der Rechtsexperte des Verbraucherverbandes , Rainer Engel , am Dienstag .
„ Schwerpunkt ist allerdings die zweite Bauserie , die kurz vor einer Generalrevision steht .
Es handelt sich eindeutig um ein Systemproblem .
“ In der Tat spricht einiges dafür , dass die Pannen bei der Deutschen Bahn hausgemacht sind .
Die sommerliche Hitze könne kaum das Problem sein .
Dass Klimaanlagen trotz extremer Temperaturen und Geschwindigkeiten von bis zu 300 Kilometern pro Stunde einwandfrei funktionieren können , beweisen die Hochgeschwindigkeitszüge in Spanien Russland oder im Nahen Osten .
Experten vermuten , dass der reihenweise Ausfall von Klimaanlagen und Lüftung an der mangelhaften Wartung liege .
Mögliche Fehlerquellen gibt es viele , wie Markus Hecht , Professor und Leiter des Fachgebiets Schienenfahrzeuge am Institut für Land - und Seeverkehr der FU Berlin , erläutert .
Kühlflüssigkeit könnte gefehlt haben , die Lüftungsfilter könnten verstopft gewesen oder die Energieversorgung der Personenwagen ausgefallen sein .
Die Bordbatterien liefern nur kurzzeitig Strom für Klima und Lüftung .
Seiner Meinung nach ist es ein Problem , dass die Bahn ihre Züge selbst wartet .
Wer dafür eigene Mitarbeiter einsetzt , müsse auf die Kosten achten .
Im Zweifelsfall wird also in diesem Punkt gespart .
Wenn die Bahn stattdessen externe Firmen beauftragen würde , könnte sie ihrerseits Druck auf die Firmen ausüben , sagt Hecht .
„ Ich zahle die Rechnung nur , wenn ich dann ein halbes Jahr keine Panne habe . “
Private Bahnunternehmen würden dies mit Erfolg tun .
„ Ein Autofahrer sollte seinen Wagen auch lieber nicht selbst reparieren “ , meint der Institutsleiter .
Die ICE - 2 - Züge müssten laut Hecht außerdem dringend modernisiert werden .
Sie seien zwar jünger als die erste Baureihe , hätten im Gegensatz zu den Vorläufern aber keine umfassende Revision hinter sich .
Es fehlt eine zeitgemäße Diagnosetechnik , die sofort über alle relevanten Pannen informiert .
Die Sensoren erkennen bisher beispielsweise Fehler bei den Toiletten und Bremsen , bei der Klimaanlage dagegen sind die gelieferten Daten zu wenig detailliert .
Der Vorsitzende des Bundestags - Verkehrsausschusses , Winfried Hermann ( Grüne ) , sagte in der „ Neuen Presse “ , die Bahn habe zu lange bei der Wartung und Modernisierungen gespart .
Dies sei eine „ Spätfolge des angestrebten Börsenganges “ .
Ziel sei eine schöne Börsenbilanz gewesen .
Bezahlen müssten das am Ende die Kunden .
Es sei schon lange bekannt , „ dass die Technik der ICE - 2 - Züge nicht mehr die beste ist , dass sie dringend modernisiert werden müsste , gerade auch die Klimaanlagen “ , sagte Hermann .
Bei der Deutschen
Bahn sind meistens erst Katastrophen nötig , damit ein System verbessert wird .
So wird auch erst jetzt über Notfallfenster im ICE nachgedacht , die die Schaffner bei ähnlichen Problemen öffnen könnten .
Zugexperte Hecht sagt , diese könnte ohne Probleme eingebaut werden .
In Hochgeschwindigkeitszügen wie dem ICE gibt es solche Fenster bisher nicht – zum einen wegen des Komforts der Fahrgäste .
Andererseits würde bei zu hohen Geschwindigkeiten der Luftwiderstand so immens steigen , dass die Bahn die Energie nicht mehr aufwenden könnte , die für den Antrieb notwendig wäre .
Falls es jedoch in den Wagen so heiß wie am vergangenen Wochenende werden sollte , wäre eine geringere Zuggeschwindigkeit sicher das geringere Problem .
Vielleicht werden ja in der künftigen ICE - Generation Notfallfenster eingebaut .
Bis dahin müssen Züge zur Not am nächstmöglichen Bahnhof halten , wie Konzernchef Rüdiger Grube anordnete .
Die Fahrgäste müssten dann auf andere Züge verteilt werden .
Bundesverkehrsminister Peter Ramsauer ( CSU ) hat eine klare Forderung an das Unternehmen , das unter seine Kontrolle fällt : „ Ich erwarte von der Deutsche Bahn , dass die Züge bei minus 40 Grad genauso zuverlässig fahren wie bei plus 40 Grad . “
Behavioral economist Dan Ariely 's
The Upside of Irrationality is the followup to his wildly successful ( and wonderful ) Predictably Irrational , a book summarizing his many years of ground - breaking research on the ways in which people reliably behave in ways that run contrary to their best interests ( something that flies in the face of neoclassical economic orthodoxy ) .
Upside of Irrationality is a mostly successful attempt to transform the scientific critique of the " rational consumer " principal into practical advice for living a better life .
" Mostly successful " only because some of our habitual irrationality is fundamentally insurmountable — there 's almost nothing we can do to mitigate it .
But even when Ariely fails to deliver easy - to - follow advice for improving our lives , he still does deliver the same thought - provoking , fascinating experimental evidence for irrationality itself .
For example , the sections on online dating ( the return on your investment in an online dating service is so poor that you might as well not bother ) and charitable giving ( it 's nearly impossible to feel the visceral sympathy for a million sufferers in some terrible genocide that you feel for a man choking to death at the next table ) are both engrossing and well - written , but the advice that Ariely gives on both amounts to , " Be aware that you 're apt to make a bad decision in these situations . "
On the other hand , there are sections in which the science of irrationality is readily converted into practical techniques for living better , and these really shine .
My favorite is the section on adaptation , that is , the way in which both terrible pain and incredible delights fade down to a kind of baseline normal over time .
Ariely points out that adaptation can be slowed or even prevented through intermittent exposure to the underlying stimulus — that is , if you take a break , the emotional sensation comes back with nearly full force .
Here 's where our intuitive response is really wrong : we have a tendency to indulge our pleasures without respite , and to take frequent breaks from those things that make us miserable .
This is exactly backwards .
If you want to maximize your pleasure — a great dessert , the delight of furnishing your first real apartment after graduation , a wonderful new relationship — you should trickle it into your life , with frequent breaks for your adaptive response to diminish .
If you want to minimize your pain — an unpleasant chore , an awful trip — you should continue straight through without a break , because every time you stop , your adaptive response resets and you experience the discomfort anew .
Also outstanding is the section on motivation in the workplace , and the way in which imbuing work - tasks with even a little meaning can make them much easier to complete and much more satisfying .
There are several pieces of good , practical information here , all couched in Ariely 's breezy , easy to read style .
Even if Ariely 's research does n't always neatly translate into simple heuristics , he 's such an interesting writer and thinker that I 'll read anything he writes .

When you hear the word burn , what does your mind think of ?
Sunburn ?
Burns from touching hot objects ?
Those are the most common ways to get a burn .
Summer is here and many people are flocking to the beaches to enjoy the warm weather .
Sometimes , it takes a while for a sun burn to make itself present .
A person might not feel the sunburn until a few hours after they ’ve gotten out of the sun .
By then , they ’ll feel the heat and the tightness of their skin and then realize they have gotten a sun burn .
Not all burns happen because of the sun though .
Burns happen when the skin comes into contact with anything hot .
You might grab a pot or pan from the stove and not realize how hot the handle is until it ’s too late .
Hot grease and even boiling water can burn skin if you spill it on yourself .
Three degrees of burns
First degree burns are mild and will only cause the skin to turn a light shade of red .
It may be a bit painful , and can take anywhere from three to six days before it heals .
Second degree burns are a bit worse .
Not only can second degree burns turn the skin red , they can also cause blisters , swelling , and the skin can start peeling .
The worst of the burns is the third degree burn .
These are quite serious , as they can actually cause the skin to char .
Third degree burns can cause damage to the nerves , and burn the skin well below the top layer .
How To Treat Burns
If you ’ve got a first or second degree burn , you ’ll be able to treat them yourself .
However , if you get a third degree burn , get to the doctor or the hospital right away .
There are many ways to treat first and second degree burns at home .
These natural burn remedies are easy and inexpensive .
When you first get burned , or when you first realize you ’ve gotten a sun burn , it ’s best to lower the temperature of the burnt skin .
Cool compresses , a cool bath , or a milk bath ( mixture of milk and water ) can do this .
Leave the cool compress or stay in the cool bath for about 15 to 30 minutes and it should relieve some of the pain and discomfort .
You do n’t want to get the compress or water too cold , as this can actually make the discomfort of the burn worse .
A great household item that can relieve burns is honey .
First wash the burn area with cool water and soap , then apply the honey to the burn .
Honey is good to use on burns that have caused blisters , because when a blister pops , there ’s a slight chance that it can get infected .
The honey will stop any infections and will also help the wound to heal .
Another food item that helps with second degree burns is papaya .
Certain enzymes are present in the papaya that remove dead cells from the wounded area .
One of the more common natural burn remedies is Aloe Vera .
Aloe Vera is an ingredient found in many body lotions on the market today .
Aloe Vera is very soothing on the burnt skin and can promote healing .
Fresh aloe Vera in combination with vitamin E makes for faster healing .
You can cut some fresh leaves from an aloe Vera plant and apply it to the burnt skin .
When the area begins to heal break open a vitamin E capsule and apply the liquid to the area .
This combination will prevent the wound from scarring .
The healing process of a burn may be sped up by what you eat .
A high protein and high calorie diet may help the burn to heal faster .
When the skin is burned , this causes a loss in micro nutrients the body needs , such as zinc , copper , and selenium .
When these micro nutrients are lower than they should be , the risk of infection is greater .
Other vitamins that are important in the healing process are vitamin C , vitamin B complex , arginine , and glutamine .
Additional natural burn remedies include the following :
St. John ’s Wort
Mint
Calendula
Witch Hazel
Mustard
Egg whites
Eating citrus fruits
Eating broccoli
Eating potatoes
Burns are never fun to get , but they do happen from time to time .
Whether you get burned from the sun , from grabbing a very hot item , or spilling hot liquids on yourself , the natural remedies above may help relieve some of the pain and discomfort .
Remember to always apply sunscreen when you go outside .
And if you get a severe third degree burn , seek medical attention immediately .

Marty Turco is quickly discovering the harsh realities of the free agent market facing him as he departs the Dallas area :
He might not be worth as much as he'd like to think he is .
ESPN is reporting that the Flyers have reached out to Marty and offered him a 3 year deal worth only a total of $ 6 million .
Last year with the Dallas Stars he made $ 5.4 million and had a cap hit of $ 5.7 on a deal he signed in the first year back from the lockout .
This is from the E.J. Hradek Blog :
Before turning his eye to Nabokov , however , Holmgren had quietly received the green light from Dallas to speak to another soon - to - be - free netminder , Stars UFA Marty Turco .
In fact , Holmgren offered Turco a three - year deal worth roughly $ 6 million ( or a bit more than $ 2 million per season ) .
The 34 - year - old Turco , who confirmed the offer via text message , politely declined , opting Thursday to test the market .
" Quietly received the green light "
Brandon Worley wonders if this is borderline tampering ...
ESPN 's Pierre LeBrun shakes this off and says it 's o.k. , since the Dallas Stars " gave permission " to the Flyers to make an offer to Turco .
I still do n't understand how that would work , since the Flyers would n't be able to sign him to that offer anyways , since he 's still under contract by the Stars .
One option would be that if Turco did agree with the offer , then the Stars would likely trade his rights to Philadelphia in exchange for a conditional draft pick .
Even if that were the case , it still feels as if the two teams are dancing on a fine line with tampering .
If it leads to the Stars getting a conditional draft pick , it 's hard to be all that upset about it because we 've already resigned ourselves to the fact that he 's leaving without compensation , but it is a pretty dicey issue .

Even though it looks unlikely , how would you feel about Marty Turco in orange ?

Europe must focus on growth as well as cutting spending to reduce national deficits , US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has told the BBC .
Speaking in Washington ahead of G8 and G20 meetings this weekend in Canada , Mr Geithner said that world leaders must concentrate on the " paramount " challenges of growth and confidence .
He added the world could not rely as much on the US as it has in the past .
The European Union says securing growth " remains a priority " .
Analysis
Should we tighten our belts now or might we starve the patient if we do it too quickly ?
There is general agreement among the G20 leaders that they do need to fix the public finances , which have been weakened by bank rescues , government stimulus packages and the tax revenue lost because of the recession .
The issue is timing .
President Obama has warned about what he sees as the danger of austerity too soon , a risk of renewed recession and economic hardship .
But it is the European Union that has been at the sharp end of financial market concerns , and it is unwilling to divert from the austerity path it has chosen .

The Group of Eight and Group of 20 rich and developing nations are assembling on Friday for three days of talks .
The leaders of the G8 countries - Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia , the UK and the US - are meeting in Muskoka , Ontario on Friday and Saturday to discuss help for poor countries .
Later on Saturday , in Toronto , the G20 will open talks on how best to emerge from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , and will conclude the summit on Sunday .
Many European governments , including the UK , have implemented severe austerity measures in recent weeks in order to cut debt levels .
UK Prime Minister David Cameron , who has arrived in Canada along with other leaders , said in an article for the Globe and Mail newspaper : " No - one can doubt the biggest promise we have to deliver : fixing the global economy . "
" I believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control , " he added .
Herman van Rompuy , the president of the European Council , said that the EU 's key words this weekend would be " growth , confidence and medium term " .
" The restoring of confidence in budgetary policies go hand in hand with effective growth strategies , " he said ahead of the meetings .
Growth challenge
When asked if Europe faced the possibility of Japanese - style stagnation if it carries on with debt reduction policies , Mr Geithner said " Europe has the capacity to prevent that " .
But he added : " Europe can make a choice to put in place the reforms and policies that will provide the possibility of stronger growth rates in the future .
" This meeting gives us the chance to sit together and look at whether we 've got a broad strategy across countries that 's going to strengthen this recovery . "
" Our job is to make sure we 're all sitting there together to focus on this challenge of growth and confidence because growth and confidence are paramount . "
Some commentators in Europe argue that austerity measures should only be introduced once strong growth has been secured in the wake of the global downturn .
This was a more widely - held position until the Greek debt crisis focused policymakers ' minds on cutting debt levels .
The Greek crisis showed that governments with high levels of debt find it very difficult to borrow money from international investors , money that they need to service existing debts .
Common goals
In a letter to G20 leaders last week , US President Barack Obama warned against cutting national debts too quickly , arguing it would put economic recovery at risk .
WHAT IS THE G20 ?
Originally set up after the Asian financial crisis in 1999 as a forum for finance ministers and central bankers
The first top - tier G20 meeting of world leaders was held in 2008 to discuss an international response to the global recession
The G20 includes Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey , the UK , the US , and also includes the EU
They are also regularly joined by Spain and the Netherlands as well as representatives from international bodies such as the World Bank , the IMF and the WTO .
We must learn from the mistakes of the past , he wrote .
While he did not name any particular government , and acknowledged that government finances need to be improved , he is clearly uneasy about the timing of such austerity measures .
But Mr Geithner said the US and Europe " have much more in common than we have differences " .
" We all agree that we have to restore responsibility to our fiscal positions .
Everyone agrees that those deficits have to come down over time to a level that 's sustainable , " he said .
But he said that the US and Europe would take " different paths , at a different pace " in order to reach the common goal .
" It 's going to require different things as we have different strengths and weaknesses , " he said .
Mr Geithner said the US was not in a position to work out what were the best policies for European countries to pursue .
The treasury secretary said the US had laid out " very ambitious plans as well " to cut its deficit .
But he said the US was in a stronger position than many other economies to cut its debt levels .
" We 're in the very good position of being able to deliver relatively strong growth rates [ compared ] to what we 're seeing in other major economies , " he said .
The Ali Forney Center ’s newly opened shelter for homeless LGBT youth in Astoria Queens was defaced last night with anti-gay graffiti .
At 6 am this morning , two of the residents of the shelter discovered the slurs which included ; " We do n't want gay people here " written on the exterior of the shelter , and " Gay Shelter " written on the site ’s door ( see attached JPG ) .
" I am infuriated that someone would target our kids in this cowardly way " says Carl Siciliano , Executive Director of the Ali Forney Center , the nation ’s largest organization serving homeless LGBT youth .
" The young people who come to us for help and shelter have already experienced terrible hardship , and I will not stand for them to be further abused . "
The Ali Forney Center ( AFC ) is working with the New York City Anti-Violence Project , with City Council Speaker Christine Quinn , and with local Councilmember Peter Vallone on devising strategies to protect its residents from further attacks .
AFC has also reached out to the local police precinct and the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force who are now conducting an investigation into the incident .

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Samsung Wave Autorun.inf Posted by Sean @ 13:50 GMT
More and more mobile phones are shipping with Windows installation files on microSD cards rather than on CD - ROMs .
All that 's needed to sync your phone with your PC is to connect the phone , detect it as a removable USB drive , and then run the installer .
Many phone vendors also include an autorun.inf file to assist the process .
Unfortunately , autorun.inf files can be infected during the production process , and microSD cards are n't read - only .
Engadget is reporting that at least some German models of Samsung 's Wave , a Linux based " iPhone killer " , are shipping with an infected autorun.inf and a file called slmvsrv.exe .
The file 's MD5 is bb9818d76fe60e68608e2a1e7bc6666 b and we detect it as Trojan .
Generic.3932466 .
We have telemetry indicating this is in the wild ( but quite limited ) .
This is yet another example of infected devices which will spread to your computer .

A Senate inquiry into the adequacy of privacy laws will soon begin , sparked by recent online privacy controversies and the government 's plans to snoop on web users ' internet communications .
The inquiry , pushed through by the Greens , will examine privacy protections and data collection on social networking sites and the data collection activities of private companies and government agencies .
A report will be delivered by October 20 .
Green Senator Scott Ludlam wants an inquiry into privacy laws .
The recent string of online data collection controversies - such as the Facebook uproar and Google Wi-Fi snooping scandal - has shown there is a need to update privacy laws in line with the next generation of internet applications , according to the Greens .
Social networking site Facebook has recently come under fire for making it difficult for users to put limits on how far the information they upload is shared .
Google has also come under scrutiny from privacy authorities around the world for the wireless connection data it gathered while compiling images for its Street View service .
Apple released the latest major version of its Web browser , Safari 5 , earlier this week .
Along with several new features — one of them somewhat controversial — the update was said to pack a number of performance improvements , including DNS pre-fetching and optimizations to Safari 's Nitro JavaScript engine .
" Safari continues to lead the pack in performance , " Apple SVP of worldwide marketing , Phil Schiller , said in a statement .
We decided to put those claims to the test , pitting Safari against leading browsers on both Mac OS X and Windows 7 .
Included in our tests are a number of JavaScript benchmarks , including the WebKit team 's SunSpider , Google 's V8 Benchmark , and Mozilla 's Dromaeo .
We also took a look at graphics acceleration performance using Microsoft 's HTML5 " Flying Images " speed demo .
The tests were run on the latest stable versions of Safari , Chrome , Firefox , and Opera on Mac OS X 10.6.3 running on a 3.0GHz , 8 - core Mac Pro with 10 GB RAM and two ATI Radeon 2600XT GPUs .
The tests were also run on Windows 7 on a 2.67 GHz Core 2 Duo PC with 4 GB of RAM and an ATI 4830 GPU .
On our Windows 7 rig we had a recent development build of Chrome ( as opposed to the latest stable version ) , and we also ran the tests using IE8 and a developer preview of IE9 .
Right off bat , our tests more or less confirmed Apple 's JavaScript speed claims on Mac OS X .
" Powered by the Nitro JavaScript engine , Safari 5 on the Mac runs JavaScript 30 percent faster than Safari 4 , three percent faster than Chrome 5.0 , and over twice as fast as Firefox 3.6 , " according to a statement released by the company .
We found Safari to be about four percent faster than Chrome , and slightly faster than Opera .
However , Firefox continues to lag significantly behind the other three browsers on raw JavaScript performance — Safari was nearly three times faster on our testbed .
However , looking at the other common JavaScript benchmarks , Safari did n't fare so well .
Chrome was nearly twice as fast as Safari running the V8 Benchmark suite , which attempts to simulate the kind of code that large - scale , next - generation Web apps would use .
Even Opera bested Safari on these tests by a significant margin .
Unsurprisingly , Firefox trailed much farther behind the other three browsers — Safari is 6 x faster , Opera is 8 x faster , and Chrome is nearly 12 x faster on these benchmarks .
The most surprising results , however , come from the Dromaeo JavaScript tests .
Safari was more than twice as fast as Firefox , but Opera was nearly 11 times faster than Safari , and Chrome was a whopping 23 times faster .
Looking closer at the individual tests , Both Chrome and Opera performed far , far better on regular expressions tests than Safari .
Optimizing regular expressions was something that the WebKit team had done two years ago to push the performance of earlier versions of its Nitro ( née Squirrel Fish Extreme ) engine , but both Opera and especially Chrome have made significant improvements since then .
Our own Ryan Paul explained that V8's approach to regular expressions spends more time on regex compilation to extract faster performance .
Regexes are n't necessarily that common on all websites , but are commonly used for form input validation .
Google 's implementation provides the biggest boost to regexes that are iterated repeatedly over larger data sets — quite similar to those used in benchmarking .
The benchmarks may weigh the results a little too heavily on regex performance , but from the looks of it , the WebKit team definitely has its work cut out for it to catch up on this particular optimization .
Another surprising result came from running one of the speed demos from Microsoft 's Internet Explorer 9 Test Drive page .
The Flying Images demo uses a number of browser icons arranged in three - dimensional space , and spins the arrangement around .
Pointing the cursor in the middle of the browser window forces the perspective to exaggerate , taxing the graphics drawing code .
Chrome only managed to animate five frames per second .
Safari was twice as fast at 11 fps , but Firefox was faster still at 17 fps .
Opera was the dark horse in this test , turning in a staggering 51 fps .
To Safari 's credit , however , it rendered the demo far better than Opera .
On the other hand , Firefox 's rendering was just as good with much smoother animation .
Given Apple 's focus on accelerating 3D CSS Transforms and otherwise leveraging the GPU for more performance , and its push to replace Flash with HTML5 and related standards , it seems unusual that Safari did n't perform better on this test .
On Windows , Safari ran just slightly slower than the development build of Chrome 6 installed when running the SunSpider benchmarks — a sign that Chrome 's fast pace of development is retuning dividends .
No surprise that IE8 just plain sucked , but the preview of IE9 shows promise .
The patterns on V8 Bench and Dromaeo were repeated on Windows , with Chrome having a massive lead on these tests .
IE9 again shows some promise of decent performance , besting Firefox , but it 's still not on par with either Safari or Opera .
The Flying Images demo results again surprised us .
Apple specifically mentioned limited GPU acceleration as one of the features for the Windows version of Safari 5 .
However , Safari tied for dead last place on this test with Chrome — which has n't done much if anything to leverage GPU acceleration — at a measly 3 fps .
Firefox was far faster at 12 fps , and Opera was far faster yet again with 28 fps .
However , IE9 turned in a mind - blowing 64 fps .
Again , given Apple 's promotion of newer Web standards for animation , the fact that this demo runs 6 times slower on Mac OS X on much more capable hardware has to be embarrassing .
Overall , Safari 5 is quite snappy , and does feel faster than Safari 4 — especially on Windows .
Though Safari's Nitro JavaScript engine may have a very slight raw performance advantage , the benchmarks we ran show that Apple and the WebKit team certainly have some areas where it can improve — both in JavaScript performance characteristics as well as optimizing performance for animation and other graphics rendering .
All this fierce competition among Apple , Microsoft , Google , Mozilla , and Opera for " fastest " browser , though , ultimately benefits all users in the long run .
Natural Back Pain Relief With a Simple Stretch
Lower back pain is one of the most common physical complaints today .
In fact , nine out of ten Americans will experience back pain sometime in their life .
There are many causes of low back pain , but one surprising cause is a tight muscle that is the deepest in the body , the psoas .
The best relief for the psoas is a massage , however there are not many people who know how to do this correctly .
Here are two stretches that might be of help for your low back pain .
The iliopsoas is actually two muscles , the psoas major and the psoas minor .
For this I will use psoas , the common name .
The psoas is the deepest muscle in the body .
It attaches on the inside of the spine at the lower back , the first through fifth lumbar and comes forward through the abdominal cavity to the inside of the point of the hip bone in the front , the anterior superior iliac spine or asis .
From there it continues around the front of the hip structure near to where the thigh comes in , and on around to the very upper inside of the thigh bone .
For the most part it is only accessible for massage or manipulation just to the inside of the asis and into the abdomen a little until it dives too deep into the abdominal cavity to press into .
On a very thin person this could be close to the navel .
It can also be reached where it attaches on the thigh behind or posterior to the inguinal ligament and the gracilis or what is commonly referred to as the groin .
Many massage schools teach that releasing the psoas with trigger point type work anywhere on the muscle will release the whole muscle .
I have found this to be only partly true .
Having the psoas worked by someone that is good at finding it and not over working it can bring an amazing opening to the abdomen , back and hips .
I have seen many low back problems resolve with this type of massage .
Working the psoas attachment on the upper inner thigh can be truly amazing , and not too hard to do on yourself .
The best stretch I know of for the psoas requires a little help .
The person needs no skill at all , just to be able to move slowly and to respond to your instructions .
Start by lying down on a massage table or high bed .
You do n’t need that much room , just so your leg can be hanging off the side with the knee bent and the foot hanging down , or if you are lower , so that the top of the foot is on the floor .
Relax the leg completely so that the knee drops down as far as it will to the side of the table .
Have the other leg extended fully so it is flat .
Your helper then takes your foot in one hand drawing it up and slightly and towards your head .
With the other hand they gently and very slowly draw the knee down .
Instruct them carefully as this is a very strong stretch and they could easily hurt you .
You might want to have them move in stages , moving just a little and stopping so you can relax all the areas involved assessing weather you need more movement or not .
It is okay if your back arches slightly .
Be careful not to overdo the stretch .
Be patient and try the stretch again another day .
I ca n’t over stress the importance of not over stretching this muscle .
Most likely it has n’t ever had a good stretch , so give it time to let you know what it needs .
The other psoas stretch can be done on your own .
Lie on your back and bend your right knee so that the foot is off to the right side with the knee at a ninety degree angle .
Use your left foot on the right knee to gently press the knee down .
Your back will almost definitely arch while you do this which is preferable .
The same cautions apply as with the previous stretch , so be careful !
As I mentioned earlier , a psoas massage is a better relief for the lower back .
Maybe I can write an article on how to do that sometime .
There is a lot more information on how to naturally treat low back pain in my Self Adjusting Technique DVD .
The ebook is almost done and should be available within a week .
Let me know if you would like a copy and I will give you a discount for pre-requesting it .
The net 's authority over names is now set to add .xxx to the set of global top level domains like .com and .net , thanks to a June 25 board vote that looks to put an end a five - year battle over the controversial addition to the net .
ICANN originally approved the proposal in 2005 , then later rejected it after political meddling by the U.S.
Last week , ICANN reluctantly said it would approve the proposal following an arbitration panel ruling that found ICANN failed to follow its own policies and changed its mind on the domain only after the U.S. government threatened its control over domain names .
The .xxx domain is opposed by both religious groups and much of the porn industry .
The former consider it an endorsement of morally repugnant material , while the latter fear that governments will try to force porn sites off of other domains like .com into a porn ghetto .
Even when .xxx is finally approved , new or existing adult sites will not have to use .xxx .
Any legislation in the U.S. to compel such a move would likely be struck down by the Supreme Court on free speech grounds , given how the court ruled on a website - labeling provision pushed by the U.S. government in the Clinton administration .
Now certainly , the internet does n't need any more porn .
And it does n't need a .xxx domain .
But ICANN 's ruling on June 25 to push along the application is the right one – ICM Registry , which is sponsoring .xxx , followed the rules , as an independent arbitration panel ruled ( . pdf ) in February .
Now , ICANN staff will quickly make sure the application is still valid , that ICM is financially stable , and then move to contract negotiations and likely final approval by the board .
ICANN 's scope of power is limited – making sure the net 's naming system works well and safely .
It controls and publishes the root file , which tells the net 's directory where to find the authoritative lookups for top - level domains such as .com , .tv , .uk , etc .
When the Bush administration told ICANN it would not let .xxx into the root file , ICANN buckled and changed its mind , instead of standing up for its independent authority .
The neutral body overseeing the net needs to demonstrate that it plays no favorites and will not tolerate meddling from governments , even the U.S. government , which still retains oversight authority over the name group .
ICANN does n't seem particularly happy about it , in no small part because it is publicly having to reverse itself again , and in part because it thinks it ought to have the power to decide what 's in the public interest .
This is especially true now that ICANN is looking to radically expand the number of top - level domains , in part to alleviate the crunch .
Most likely , it will become , like .info , a low - rent home for sites run by hackers who want to infect your computer with malware .
But oddly , that 's actually all right .
An easily avoided , bad neighborhood in a big , big world run on principles of openness and fairness is better than having the net devolve into a Disneyland run by the whims of whomever happens to be in charge or who is swayed by threats from whatever country happens to have the most carrier fleets .
So here 's to .xxx .
May it live and be mostly ignored .

This week on Dress Code , we 're taking it on : the bra , in all its catileverd , underwired , full - cupped , convertible , molded , contoured , minimizing , padded , push - up , strapless , full - figured , 18 - hour glory .

Among the many complicated conundrums of modern existence , few are more baffling , more overwhelming , more disspiriting than the brassiere .
Symbol or reality , it 's problematic : fit , shape , color - all these provide a source of stress we do n't need .
And yet , the bra is a wonderful feat of engineering , and one capable of greatly enhancing our comfort .
Now , there are a lot of bad things we can say about the Internet , but bra-shopping is one of those times when it shows its worth : for convenience and sheer variety , we 've never had it so good , bra-wise .
What follows is just a start , a mere toe - dip into the sea that is bras .
And here , more than ever , I 'm counting on your collective expertise for advice on sourcing , shopping and fitting - so let 's bring on the brain trust !
Here , a few basic questions that the bra necessarily suggests :
Do you need a bra ?
" Need " is perhaps the wrong word ; few of us will die without brassieres , and many women lived many millennia without them .
That said , many of us are more comfortable with the support .
My mom never wore a bra ; she was small - busted and did n't like them .
On the other hand , I did object when my dad 's cousin , an aging radical , went into our bags at a family reunion and threw out everyone 's bras behind our backs as an act against the patriarchy .
Some people use the " pencil " rule but like most rules , it 's totally arbitrary .
Do what you want .
( Not in the " go to hell " way . )

Bra Fitting :
You 've all heard the stats : 80 % of us wear the wrong bra size .
In the grand scheme of things , this is not a tragedy .
However , as anyone who 's watched What Not to Wear can tell you , a properly - fitting bra can make you a lot more comfortable and does all kinds of magical things to posture and clothes .
Even if you do n't care about lifting , separating , miniminzing or maximizing , the support 's nice - and if you want any of the above , well , a good bra can do that too .
If you can , get a professional fitting .
Whether it's from the intimates department of a department store , just about any lingerie boutique , a " fitting specialist " ( Google it ! ) or the Orthodox guy on the Lower East Side who can size you up at ten paces , they 'll often surprise you with their magical revelations about back - size and cup ratio .
If you do n't have access to one of these miracle workers , do n't fret .
Grab a measuring tape and let 's roll .
1 . Pull the measuring tape around your back and across the fullest part of your bust .
Make sure the measuring tape around your back remains parallel to the floor .
Measure the total number of inches and make a note .
Advertisement
2 . Now , extend the measuring tape around your back and under your arms , still making sure that the tape remains parallel to the floor .
With your arms down , place the tape just above your bust where your breast starts .
Measure the total number of inches and record it .
This measurement is your band size .
3. Subtract the second measurement from the first measurement .
The difference is your cup size .
For example , if your first measurement was 39 " and your second measurement was 35 " , you would use this equation : 39 " - 35 " = 4 " .
According to the chart below , you would be a D cup .
If you did n't end up with a whole number , round up to the nearest whole inch .
Advertisement
1 - inch difference A Cup
2 - inch difference B Cup
3 - inch difference C Cup
4 - inch difference D Cup
5 - inch difference DD Cup
6 - inch difference F Cup
Is this exact ?
No .
But it 's a good starting - point .
A well - fitting bra should feel snug , but not binding .
It should not cut into your breasts or your shoulders .
The front center should rest near your sternum , and the back bit should rest on or near your shoulder blades .
Your breasts should not spill out from either top nor bottom , and the straps should sit firmly and comfortably on your shoulders .
When you try one that fits , you 'll know the difference .
Keep in mind that bra straps are not what provides support : the sling , along with the cups and hooks , does .
( The straps are there to raise the breasts . )

Bra Terminology : A Partial Glossary
Underwire : A thin , flexible wire which provides added support .
Underwire can be either mesh ( the most common ) or seamless .
Advertisement
Convertible Bra :
Often a strapless with detachable straps , so that you can switch 'em around and wear under strapless , racerback , halter and asymmetrical tops .
Contour Bra :
A contour bra has molded cups : they 're padded or lined and have underwire .
Some women like them under clothes because they create a symmetrical look .
Advertisement
Molded Bra :
This bra , which has machine - molded cups , can be either soft - cup or underwire , with a more natural look than the contour .
Demi-Cup Bra : Demi bras cover the nipple and and part of the breast , but because they do n't have much coverage , are better for smaller busts .
Full - Coverage Bra aka Full - Cup : the most supportive , the full - cup does just what the name implies .
Advertisement
Minimizer Bra : Can compress breasts up to 1 cup size smaller .
Padded Bra : Contains padded lining , thicker at the base for a natural look .
Push - up Bra :
These tend to use underwire , some padding , and an angled cup to squeeze the boobs up .
Cami Bra or Bandeau : Basically , a strip of stretchy fabric .
Good for the small - busted among us and can sometimes even do double - duty as a cami under something low - cut .
Not , however , terribly supportive .
Adhesive Bra :
This is , generally speaking , not for everyday use .
Literally a bra that sticks to your skin , it 's great for strapless , backless or other evening situations where you do n't want to show strap .
A " breast petal " is a smaller version : basically , individual adhesive cups for each breast .
Think of it as a less painful alternative to the old masking - tape trick .
Advertisement
T- Shirt Bra : A T- Shirt bra is generally molded , frequently seamless , and designed to not show under thin fabric .
Clear Bra Straps :
About ten years ago , these were ubiquitous .
They 're weird , both because they 're rubbery , and because they 're generally still visible .
However , they 're a popular summer choice for some who neither want to grapple with strapless , nor show any obvious lingerie .
Concealer Strap :
A little clip that can do some of the work of a convertible , pinching straps together to help them work under a racerback or cross - back top .
Advertisement
Strapless Bra :
I am convinced that the perfect strapless has yet to be invented and am still resigned to pulling and tugging at them on those few occasions when I feel I have no alternative .
Full - Figured Bra :
This generally has a deeper cup and more coverage .
This one really has more to do with the shape of the breast than the back - size ; a fuller breast shape may be more comfy in one of these babies .
Nursing Bra :
As the name implies , a nursing bra has a tearaway cup that allows easy nursing access and re-dressing .
Advertisement
Sports Bra :
I recommend actually consulting at a sports store , and trying on a few .
Sports bras are not the monoboob monolith they once were .
In fact , your needs will vary depending on your activity level .
There are three basic kinds : compression bras , encapsulated compression bras , and adjustable encapsulated compression bras .
If you 're small - busted ( A or B ) a compression bra should work .
Otherwise , an encapsulated or adjustable encapsulated bra , with individual cups , is a more supportive choice .
Women with larger chests should also look out for a racerback .
No matter what , it should n't feel uncomfortably binding or restrict movement !

Bra FAQ :
What 's Bra Turnover ?
Technically , you should replace bras every six months .
I find this too painful , but really , if you 're down to the last hook and the straps are losing their elasticity , they 're not doing their job .
Save ones with sentimental value .
Obviously , if your size has changed due to hormones , weight gain or any number of factors , take note : your breast size is often one of the first things to change .
Advertisement
Care ?
Try to give your bras a day off so the elastic can rebound .
Ideally , hand - wash with a delicate detergent , and then air - dry .
Shaking them with cool water in a large jar , then rinsing , is a good method , but I must confess to usually doing mine all at once in the bathtub and stirring everything around with a big dedicated wooden spoon like Mrs. Buckets in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory when she sings " Cheer Up , Charlie . "
The washing machine really does shorten their life - span like an all - lard diet , but if you must : use a delicates bag ( available at any place you can find laundry bags ) , use the delicates cycle , and whatever you do , do n't stick them in the dryer .
How many bras should you own ?
The bare minimum bra wardrobe would probably consist of :
4 " everyday bras " - the style you wear every day .
Minimalists recommend black and white .
True minimalists would say to get them all in a shade that matches your skin - tone , so you can wear them all under anything .
I say , make sure there 's one skin - tone guy in there .

1 convertible .
For all your weird - shirt needs .
Ideally , this can turn into a strapless .
If you wear lots of low - cut stuff , consider a deep - plunge bra .
And while we 're at it , one with not - ugly straps is always nice .
Especially if , like me , you loathe strapless .
Advertisement
What should I wear under what ?
When in doubt , the skin - tone comes close to being all - purpose , color - wise .
Under something gossamer - fine , if you do n't like lines , wear a tee - shirt bra .
And a good convertible bra should take care of the rest .
Can I show strap ?
At work , let 's go with no .
In general , do as you like : right now , there 's a major strap - showin ' , 90 's - revivin ' free - for - all going on across the land , so no one blinks .
My personal rule is , make sure it 's deliberate ; something pretty showing is very different from a stray strap in a muddy shade of beige .

If you 're big - busted : a few things to look for are comfort straps , full - coverage , and " plus sizes , " which is confusingly used to mean both cup and back sizes , depending on the brand .
Of course , the real trick with larger bras is to find ones that are not just functional , but attractive .
A few favorites are Bali's ( specifically the uber - comfy " Downtime " ) Wacoal ( which has a range of options , both attractive and utilitarian ) , and - do n't laugh - Frederick 's of Hollywood .
I know : I was skeptical too .
But one of my friends , who 's very particular about sexy lingerie and happens to be an F cup , swears by it .
And she was right !
( Plus , you can pick up a sexy elf costume while you 're at it . )
If you 're looking for something a bit higher - end , Chantelle makes really pretty bras up to an H cup .
If you 're small - busted : while you can get away with something less structured - and more delicate ! - a lot of women like the more defined look of bras with structured cups .
Obviously , you can wear padding if you like it , but do n't feel you need to !
Those bras designed for " petites " are often a good resource - contrary to what the name implies , they generally come in a range of back sizes .

If you 're petite : Lula Lu is a site devoted smaller proportions : the straps are closer , the backs small , and , incidentally , sizes are from AAA .
Wacoal also makes a line of well - priced petite bras that a friend was recently raving about .
If , like some of us , you 've got a small frame and a larger cup size , Bravissimo is a good resource .
If you 're plus - sized :
There are lines devoted to larger proportions and back - sizes .
And , many are great : one friend swears by HipsandCurves .
While as in all things Victoria 's Secret , people seem divided , their Cacique line has a wide range of styles that run from 36C to 48DDD , F , G , and H . Other good options can be found at BareNecessities.com .
But there 's a lot out there !

If your breasts are unevenly sized :
This is a common issue !
In general , any bra with a stretchy cup will be a more comfortable choice .
No manufacturer seems to make bras with different cup - sizes , so , generally , it 's easiest to fit to your larger cup and then buy a little insert ( called , horribly , a " cookie " ) that slips under the smaller breast so's they can comfortably share a bra .
If you 've had a mastectomy : there are a lot of options for post - mastectomy bras - think , whole websites devoted to it - most of which involve removable padding on one or both cups .
A few good resources : Jodee.com and TLC .
Specialty bras .
There are a few things you can do to " customize " your bras .
If you have a hard time finding bras that fit your back , a bra extender may be able to help .
Basically , it 's a flexible band that attaches to the bra's closure and makes it wider .
We 've already talked about the " cookie " phenomenon , but it really can work to even out cleavage if that 's something that worries you .
( Both these accessories are inexpensive and can be easily found online .
Here 's one source . )
Remember : there are hundreds of specialty bra fitters that work specifically to help women find unusual sizes , and this is one case where the Internet is a lifesaver .
And in a pinch ( and with a lot of disposable income ) there is always the ultimate in luxury : custom brassieres .

Arizona state Treasurer Dean Martin proposed the creation of tent cities to help deal with the expected increase of illegal immigrants in the state .
Ariz .
pol wants immigrant ' tent city '
Arizona state Treasurer Dean Martin , a Republican candidate for governor , called on Tuesday for the creation of statewide tent cities to house the expected increase in the number of illegal immigrants expected to be arrested under the state ’s controversial new immigration law .
Martin offered the proposal during a news conference , suggesting the camp - like setups would be similar to the existing tent city jails in Maricopa County that frequently hold DUI offenders and inmates moved out of crowded county jails .

His proposal is in response to growing concerns in Arizona that the cash - strapped state cannot afford to enforce the new immigration law that goes into effect next month .
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , one of the new law ’s strongest defenders , has for years maintained tent city jails in Phoenix , which frequently receive favorable news coverage and have proven politically popular .
Martin is trailing Gov. Jan Brewer in the state ’s Republican primary after her reelection prospects were boosted by signing the widely popular immigration bill .
Martin attacked Brewer during the news conference , contending that she ’s not truly committed to securing the border .
Martin said Brewer only began paying attention to the issue “ when she started doing election - year polling . ”
Image caption Security across Toronto has been heightened ahead of the summit
A man in Toronto has been charged with possession of explosives in what police say is an arrest related to a G20 summit in the Canadian city .
Police said Byron Sonne , aged 37 , was held after a raid on a home in midtown Toronto on Tuesday .
His partner , Kristen Peterson , also 37 , has also been charged .
Police said the investigation was part of the ongoing effort to ensure " a safe and secure G20 Summit " held in Toronto this weekend .
Ms Peterson was charged on Thursday with possession of an explosive device and possession of a weapon .
Publication ban
Local media said more than 50 officers were involved in the raid on the couple 's home .
Police officials said they executed a search warrant which led to the arrest of Mr Sonne .
He was charged on Wednesday with intimidation , threats against the justice system , possession of dangerous weapons and mischief .
Details of his court appearance on Wednesday are subject to a publication ban .
In a statement , Canada 's Integrated Security Unit ( ISU ) , which is responsible for the security of the G20 summit , said : " There is no risk to public safety . "
The ISU Police declined to give further details about the arrest .
Mr Sonne is expected to appear again in court later this week for a bail hearing .
( CNN ) -- Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick urged a school district to revise its policy allowing students as young as in elementary schools to get condoms if they are believed to be sexually active .
" It is simply not age appropriate to have a program in place for such young children , not to mention not having parents of such young children involved , " Patrick said in a statement .
" Comprehensive reproductive health education needs to be done in an age appropriate manner . "
The policy -- passed this month -- has no minimum age on supplying condoms to students .
It allows nurses to give condoms to students they think are sexually active after counseling and education without informing their parents .
Provincetown school district superintendent , Beth Singer , who wrote the policy , said she wanted to ensure students of all ages requesting condoms get information on their use .
" Sex has no age limit .
It 's an individual scenario for each person , " Singer said .
" We ca n 't put out an age for using condoms . "
Singer said the policy is being misunderstood and was never intended for elementary school students .
It makes it clear that " we are against ( students ) being sexually active , " she said .
The superintendent urged parents to discuss sex issues with their children , including letting them know that abstinence is the only safeguard .
A Provincetown school committee voted unanimously for the policy June 10 .
It was due to go into effect in the fall , but the committee plans to re-examine its wording amid the concerns .
Some parents in the school district decried the policy , saying it encourages children to be sexually active .
" This policy is stripping children of their innocence and making them more vulnerable to sexual predators , " said Sherri Smitt , whose daughter graduated from Provincetown High School .
Evelyn Reilly of the Massachusetts Family Institute called the policy " absurd " and said it does not give parents a say .
" Sex ed allows parents to make the decision to opt their child out , this policy is essentially saying it's not the parents business if their child is having sex , " Reilly said .
" It is emotionally , physically and psychologically disturbing . "
CNN 's Vivienne Foley contributed to this report .
John McCain continues , comically , to move far to the right on immigration reform , for the noble purpose of winning his own primary .
The former champion of creating paths to citizenship for illegal immigrants now just barks " no amnesty , " like everyone .
In case anyone forgot : John McCain and Ted Kennedy worked together in 2007 to create a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would work to secure the border but also create a process to move most illegal immigrants towards legality , which seemed like a better option than arresting millions and millions of people .
McCain then shifted towards a more balanced and " tough sounding " position earlier this year : " complete the danged fence , " the very thing he thought was a stupid idea three years ago .
No one would ever sneak across again , save a few million .
This would cost a lot of money , too .
Now we have this :
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) said Tuesday he would favor immigration reform that would deport many of the residents of the United States who are here illegally .
McCain , who at one point had been the top Republican advocate for immigration legislation promising a pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants , said he favored establishing a guest worker program .
But McCain expressed opposition to any program that would give illegal immigrants a way to become citizens .
" No amnesty .
Many of them need to be sent back , " McCain said during an interview on KQTH - FM in Tucson , Ariz .
Well , when the Senator ( probably ) wins his illustrious fifth term this November , he can coordinate this mass arrest process , how about that ?
He 'll put in a budget request for " 10,000,000 nets , like for capturing butterfies , eh? eh ? " before realizing that his primary is over and he can stop caring about this for another five years .

Exclusive : Iranian Nuke Scientist Is En Route to Iran Shahram Amiri , who defected to the US , boarded flight to Qatar Tuesday .
July 14 , 2010  --
The CIA has lost one of its most valued former spies .
Iranian nuclear scientist Shahram Amiri , who defected to the US , is now on his way back home to Tehran after a very messy and public re-defection .
ABC News obtained exclusive photos of Amiri leaving Washington 's Dulles International Airport late Tuesday night on a commercial flight to Doha , Qatar , en route to Iran .
Amiri was escorted directly to the jetway entrance by a security officer .
He was flanked by what appeared to be a U.S. official and a representative from the Pakistani Embassy in Washington .
_He boarded the Qatar Airways flight ahead of the other passengers , and spoke only to his companions .
After more than a year in the US , Amiri claimed he had never really defected .
In a series of videos released on the internet , he insisted that he had been kidnapped , drugged and tortured by the CIA .
The US flatly denies that it ever held Amiri against his will .
" Let me say that Mr. Amiri has been in the United States of his own free will , " said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
" And he is free to go . "
Clinton said that Amiri was actually scheduled to travel to Iran on Monday " but was unable to make all the of the necessary arrangements to reach Iran through transit countries . "
U.S. officials tell ABC News that Amiri defected in the spring of 2009 after working for several years for the CIA while still inside the Iranian nuclear program .
But officials say that after Amiri was re-located to Tucson , Arizona he began to have second thoughts .
In a battle of videos posted on YouTube , first by the Iranians and then the CIA , Amiri changed his story three times .
First , he told Iranian TV via computer phone he had been kidnapped .
Then , in a CIA - produced video , Amiri said he was happy to be in the US .
Later , he again claimed he was trying to elude US agents so he could be reunited with his wife and son in Iran .
" In case anything happens to me or if I do not make it back home safely , the responsibility will solely rest on the officials of the United States , " Amiri said in one of the videos .

" This happens all the time , " said Bob Baer , a former CIA officer who worked in the Middle East .
" Defectors come up with a good idea to make a lot of money , and then once the boredom sets in and the loneliness , they want to get back in touch with the family .
They realize it was a huge mistake . "
Amiri Leaves for Iran , Americans Still Held by Iranians
On Monday evening Amiri showed up in Washington , DC at the Iranian interest section of the Pakistani embassy .
Because the US and Iran do not have full diplomatic relations , Iran does not maintain its own embassy in Washington .
Before his flight home , Amiri told Iranian television he had finally escaped from the hands of US intelligence , something US intelligence officials say he had to say to avoid being imprisoned or executed upon his return to Tehran .
" If they want to keep up the pretense that he was kidnapped , " said Baer , " I think they 'll probably keep him alive .
I think they 'll give him a couple of years as a public hero .
After that I can't tell you . "

The case of the returned defector allows the US to again ask Iran to release the three young American hikers it is holding as spies , as well as to raise the issue of former FBI agent Robert Levinson , who has been missing in Iran for three years .

The White House and leading lawmakers came to an agreement Monday about how to end the ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military , likely speeding the end of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
Backers were optimistic that they could this week attach the amendment to a broader defense funding bill expected to pass this year .
The bill would n't immediately repeal the Clinton - era policy .
Rather , it would take effect as soon as a Pentagon review is complete and the president signs off on the military 's recommendations for how to undertake the change in policy .
President Barack Obama and Pentagon leaders have already said they were committed to ending the policy and allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces .
But in order to lift the ban , Congress must act as well .
If the proposed legislation becomes law , the change can occur once the review is finished .
Gay rights activists have been frustrated with the pace of the repeal effort and lack of progress on other items on their agenda , and they cheered Monday 's development as a big step forward .
" We are on the brink of historic action to both strengthen our military and respect the service of lesbian and gay troops , " said Joe Solmonese , president of the Human Rights Campaign .
A petroleum engineer who ’s worked in the oil industry tells me BP is doing the minimum to clean up the oil and everything it can to protect its bottom line .
According to the engineer , here ’s what BP should be doing right now to mitigate the damage .
If the President were to put BP into temporary receivership , he ’d have the power to get BP to :
1. Stop releasing dispersants .
So - called dispersants are toxic , and it ’s crazy to add more poison to the Gulf .
Dispersants do nothing to assist the environment in naturally cleaning the oil ; their main use is PR .
They reduce the number of ugly pictures of birds covered in pure black crude .
Dispersants break the thick layer of crude into smaller globs , but that does n’t help the Gulf and its wildlife .
Most of the crude just mixes with the water to produce a goop that looks like chocolate ice cream but is highly poisonous .
2. Mobilize every possible tanker to siphon up crude from as close to the leak points as possible .
Oil industry leaders as John Hofmeister ( president of Shell Oil from 2005 until 2008 ) have recommended this , but inexplicably neither BP nor the federal government are talking about even trying this idea .
BP currently has only one spot where they have inserted a tube into a riser , or pipe , that is leaking oil from the sea floor .
The company is gathering the crude oil and siphoning it up to a drill ship for storage .
They should have at least a dozen collectors .
BP has 24 tankers that are being used to make money for BP , not for clean - up duty .
( President Obama should also use all necessary federal power — or money , and send BP the bill — to put as many tankers and refineries from other companies on the task . )
Mile - long pipes could be dangled down into the crude spewing from the wellhead and at each breach in the riser pipe , and the tankers could pump the crude mixed with water back into the tankers .
They could then separate the crude and water in the tanker , and pump the water out on the spot .
This should continue until each tanker is full of oil .
The crude should then be taken to a refinery for processing , as other tankers take their place .
Submersibles can be used to monitor the uptake into the dangling pipes , moving them as needed to keep them picking up as much crude as possible .
Even after some separation time in the tankers , the crude will be contaminated with water beyond the typical water contamination levels acceptable at refineries .
This would drive up the price of gas in the short term .
The president will need to go on TV and ask all Americans to cut their gasoline and energy usage in half , as an emergency response to the disaster in the Gulf , so that tankers and refineries can enact these far - from - perfect cleanup measures .
3. Restart work on the second pressure relief well .
BP did start work on two relief wells as the government requested , but the second has been shut down to cannabalize parts from it for the primary well kill effort .
The President must order BP to spend whatever money it takes to get another blow out preventer on site , to re-start work on the second pressure relief well .
A recent blow - out off the coast of Australia required five pressure relief wells to successfully shut it down .

In emotional and personal testimony , an ex-Justice official who quit over the handling of a voter intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party accused his former employer of instructing attorneys in the civil rights division to ignore cases that involve black defendants and white victims .
J. Christian Adams , testifying Tuesday before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights , said that " over and over and over again , " the department showed " hostility " toward those cases .
He described the Black Panther case as one example of that -- he defended the legitimacy of the suit and said his " blood boiled " when he heard a Justice official claim the case was n't solid .
" It is false , " Adams said of the claim .
" We abetted wrongdoing and abandoned law - abiding citizens , " he later testified .
The department abandoned the New Black Panther case last year .
It stemmed from an incident on Election Day in 2008 in Philadelphia , where members of the party were videotaped in front of a polling place , dressed in military - style uniforms and allegedly hurling racial slurs while one brandished a night stick .
The Bush Justice Department brought the first case against three members of the group , accusing them in a civil complaint of violating the Voter Rights Act .
The Obama administration initially pursued the case , winning a default judgment in federal court in April 2009 when the Black Panther members did not appear in court .
But then the administration moved to dismiss the charges the following month after getting one of the New Black Panther members to agree to not carry a " deadly weapon " near a polling place until 2012 .
In a statement Tuesday , a Justice spokesman said the civil rights division determined " the facts and the law did not support pursuing claims " against the two other defendants and denied Adams ' allegations .
" The department makes enforcement decisions based on the merits , not the race , gender or ethnicity of any party involved .
We are committed to comprehensive and vigorous enforcement of both the civil and criminal provisions of the federal laws that prohibit voter intimidation , " the spokesman said .
The Civil Rights Commission , which subpoenaed Adams , has been probing the incident since last year .
Adams said he ignored department directives not to testify and eventually quit after he heard Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez testify that there were concerns the Black Panther case was not supported by the facts .
Adams has described the case as open - and - shut and said Tuesday that it was a " very low moment " to hear Perez make that claim .
But he described the department 's hostility toward that and other cases involving black defendants as " pervasive . "
Adams cited hostility in the department toward a 2007 voting rights case against a black official in Mississippi who was accused of trying to intimidate voters .
Adams said that when the Black Panther case came up , he heard officials in the department say it was " no big deal " and " media - generated " and point to " Fox News " as the source .
But as the investigation unfolded , he said he discovered " indications " that the Black Panther Party was doing the " same thing " to supporters of former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primary season in early 2008 .
He urged the commission to pursue testimony from other Justice officials to corroborate his story .
It 's unclear how far the commission will get .
The commissioners want to hear from Christopher Coates , the former chief of the Justice Department 's voting section , but the commission claims the Justice Department is blocking Coates from testifying about why the case was dropped .
In a written statement last week , the department questioned the motives of Adams , now an attorney in Virginia and a blogger for Pajamas Media .
" It is not uncommon for attorneys with the department to have good faith disagreements about the appropriate course of action in a particular case , although it is regrettable when a former department attorney distorts the facts and makes baseless allegations to promote his or her agenda , " the statement said .
Adams said Tuesday that his personal views played no part in his handling of the case .
He also said he did not fight to testify before the commission but resigned after the department would not take action to quash the subpoena .
As we reported on Friday , a critical bill that was unable to pass this past week was the extension of unemployment benefits to millions of Americans currently collecting a $ 1,200 average monthly stipend from the US government for sitting on their couch and not paying their mortgage .
As a result of this huge hit to endless governmental spending of future unearned money , the WSJ reports that " a total of 1.3 million unemployed Americans will have lost their assistance by the end of this week . "
Furthermore , the cumulative number of people whose extended benefits are set to run out absent this extension , will reach 2 million in two weeks , and continue rising : as a reminder the DOL reported over 5.2 million Americans currently on Extended Benefits and EUC ( Tier 1 - 4 ) .
The net result is yet another hit to the US ledger , as soon 2 million Americans will no longer recycle $ 1,200 per month into the economy .
In other words , beginning in July , there will be $ 2.4 billion less spent each month by America 's jobless on such necessities as LCD TVs ( that critical 4th one for the shoe closet ) , iPads and cool looking iPhones that have cool gizmos but refuse to hold a conversation the second the phone is touched the " wrong " way .
As the number of jobless whose benefits expire grows , the full impact of lost money will progressively increase , and absent some last minute compromise , the monthly loss will promptly hit $ 5 billion per month .
Annualized this is a hit of $ 60 billion to " consumption " , and represents roughly 120 million iPads not purchased , and about half a percentage point of GDP ( ignoring various downstream multiplier effects ) .
Worst of all , as these people surge back into the labor force , the unemployment rate is about to spike by nearly 1 % , up to 10.5 % .
From the WSJ :
On Thursday , Senate Democrats failed to secure the 60 votes needed to break off a GOP - led filibuster .
Sen. Ben Nelson ( D. , Neb . ) voted with Republicans in a 57 - 41 roll call .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D. , Nev. ) said this third vote on the matter would be the last , allowing the Senate to move on to modest legislation cutting taxes for small businesses .
The collapse of the wide - ranging legislation means that a total of 1.3 million unemployed Americans will have lost their assistance by the end of this week .
It will also leave a number of states with large budget holes they had expected to fill with federal cash to help with Medicaid costs .
Up in the air are other provisions that were to be included in the legislation , including some $ 50 billion in new taxes designed to help offset its cost .
They included an increase in levies paid by private investment groups , including hedge - fund firms and real - estate partnerships , a provision long sought by some Democrats that will likely return another day .
Under a program initially enacted last year — which expired June 2 — jobless workers could receive up to 99 weeks of aid , including 26 weeks of basic assistance provided by states plus longer - term federal payments .
The Labor Department estimates that the long - term unemployed , meaning those out of a job for at least six months , make up 46 % of all jobless workers in the U.S .
And like every other stimulus program , there are those who focus on possible cons from the program end ...
There are economic risks in ending benefits .
Workers receiving them tend to funnel money back into the economy immediately , helping prop up demand and jobs .
In addition , said Harvard economist Lawrence Katz , if workers are unable to find work and no longer eligible for unemployment benefits , some will turn to other government programs , such as disability and Social Security .
" If you 're really concerned about the long - term deficit , you should be really concerned about the long - term unemployed , " Mr. Katz said .
and pros ...
Other economists argue that extended benefits have played a part in keeping people out of the labor force .
" There 's a very large body of research that says that more generous benefits and benefits that last longer … encourage people to stay out of work longer , " said Bruce Meyer , an economist and public policy professor at the University of Chicago .
James Sherk , a labor economics analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank , said that while it could be argued that the benefits made available last year were too extensive , cutting off workers who expected to receive the full 99 weeks of benefits is n't ideal either .
" You do n't sort of pull the rug out from someone halfway through , " he said .
In our view , what will happen is that the 1.3 million who had gotten used to receiving benefits ( and for whom we certainly feel sorry , as once again expectations and reality under the current administration diverge in a dramatic fashion ) and had no desire to look for work , will immediately flood back into the labor force to find some job , any job , that pays even remotely as well as what the government did .
What this means is that the total labor force ( which incidentally dropped by 322,000 From April to May ) of 154.393 million , is about to grow by at least 1.3 million , and as much as 2 million , in July .
And since census employment peaked , and the number of employed will stay flat ( at best ) at 139.420 million , the expansion in the total labor force , will increase the unemployment rate by almost 1 % in just a month , growing from 9.7 % in May to 10.5 % in July .
That number will be reported in late August .
But by then the sequel to the Great Depression v2 movie will be playing in every theater across the land , and this number will be the least of our worries .

defining the female gaze
In response to something I posted recently about “ the female gaze , ” I got an email from a male reader who appeared to believe that “ the female gaze ” refers to “ movies women like to watch . ”
It does n’t .
Not even close .
But his email got my thinking that perhaps I need to explain what “ the female gaze ” is about , and why it ’s become so much more important to me lately .
There ’s a lot of detailed information available about the concept of “ the gaze ” and “ the male gaze ” — this TV Tropes page will be illuminating to someone with an interest in pop culture — and the obvious retronym of “ the female gaze , ” and there ’s no point in me parroting it .
But in extreme brief , the male gaze was coined by Laura Mulvey in a 1970s feminist critique of film , but it has since been retconned into applying to all realms of visual art .
The very basic idea is that throughout Western art , from the Renaissance painters through modern film , television , advertising , videogames , and comic books , there is an unspoken assumption underlying the vast majority of the work that the viewer / reader / consumer / player is male and heterosexual , because the creators have been and are , in the vast majority , male and heterosexual .
And if a straight woman or a homosexual man wants to appreciate these works , she or he must at least temporarily assume the perspective of a straight man .
( We can presume , I think , that the fact that in some instances , a lesbian woman would n’t need to adjust her perspective to fully appreciate these works is an entirely accidental matter of circumstance : because the creators were not consciously crafting a work to represent male heterosexual perspective , there seems to be no likelihood that they consciously considered that lesbian women would identify with their work . )
So , when it comes to TV and film and other pop culture , the way the male gaze manifests itself is in such hideous examples as these , all recent , and all of which infuriated me :
= In Marmaduke , ostensibly a children ’s movie , male household pets get hot and bothered over human women , and the camera looks at female animals the same way other films look at human woman : gauzy , slo - mo ; it makes them ( supposedly ) sultry and seductive and provocative .
A male director and male screenwriters were “ naturally ” compelled to create a story about a male dog , from the male dog ’s perspective , with the perspectives of the two female dogs he romances all but ignored as unimportant : what is important is what Marmaduke wants , what Marmaduke does , what Marmaduke learns .
= The interesting twist of the gay male gaze of director Michael Patrick King turned the normally lovely female stars of Sex and the City 2 into hideous freaks .
It ’s the terrible flip side of the usual hetero male gaze on beautiful women , which typically fetishizes them , reduces them to body parts .
King does n’t find women sexually attractive , so he makes them ugly and freakish .
= At a very popular gossip site ( which I wo n’t link to ) , a certain young celebrity ( whose name I wo n’t mention ) who may have gained a little weight is discussed in appalling terms that reduce her to less - than - human status .
She is
a lump of shit .
This little butterball is just nothing but grease and fat and vodka .
She ’d be a good fuel source .
Probably burn for at least a month .
This is meant to be “ funny . ”
But it ’s also meant to remind this celeb that she is only useful as long as men want to look at her .
= Playboy gleefully catalogues how “ breast shapes ” have gone in and out of fashion in the postwar period ( as discussed at Jezebel ) .
Women cannot change the shape of their breasts , of course — aside from some very narrow changes that implants can create — so what ’s really changing is the appearance of the breast that the male gaze is willing to gaze at .
= Bret Easton Ellis recently insisted that women cannot be successful as film directors because they lack a “ male gaze ” ; the medium , Ellis believes :
really is built for the male gaze and for a male sensibility … .
We ’re watching , and we ’re aroused by looking , whereas I do n’t think women respond that way to films , just because of how they ’re built .
And therein is one particularly insidious assumption of the male gaze : that women are not aroused by looking at men .
You ’ll find this idea parroted by lots of people — including lots of women ! — who will say things like , “ Well , of course there are more female nudes : the female body is simply more beautiful than the male body , which is weird and strange . ”
The notion is self - perpetuating , because as long as art ( in all its many incarnations , from fine art to videogames ) fails to look at men as beautiful and worth looking at , viewers will not learn how to appreciate men as beautiful and worth looking at .
Yes , beauty is in the eye of the beholder , but it ’s also something we learn .
( Look : “ Vincent and the Doctor ” just demonstrated wonderfully that people had to learn how to find Van Gogh ’s paintings beautiful ! )
Now , caveats :
The male gaze is not necessarily lascivious ( though sometimes it is ) — women ’s bodies are beautiful .
And critiquing the male gaze is not to say that there ’s anything wrong with straight men finding women beautiful .
The problem with the male gaze — and the desperate need for a more prominent female gaze — is its dominance , not just visually but as the provider of the perspective .
Because most filmmakers and TV creators are still straight men , we are still bombarded with stories that , even when they are ostensibly about women are still really about women seen from a male perspective .
( And I should say , “ stories that are about straight women ” ; mainstream stories about lesbian women are all but nonexistent , from any perspective . )
It results in movies such as The Ugly Truth , which appears to give us two sides of a battle - of - the - sexes coin but actually only smacks down the female side while giving the male side a hearty , approving slap on the back .
And like Knocked Up , which seems almost ignorant of the stuff of women ’s experiences even where it directly impacts on the story ( such as the female protagonist , an adult woman , appearing to have never been to a gynecologist prior to her manifesting as a character in a pregnancy comedy ) .
And even the good and great movies are still overwhelmingly from a hetero - male perspective — why are we limiting our art this way ?
It ’s when you see a movie that embodies the female gaze that you realize how startling it is to get that new perspective .
Floria Sigismondi’s
The Runaways is all about girls claiming and using their sexuality for their own purposes and their own needs .
Jane Campion ’s Bright Star looks with desire on Ben Whishaw ’s John Keats from the fully engaged perspective of Abbie Cornish ’s Fanny Brawne , not only with her eye but with her mind as well .
Andrea Arnold ’s astonishing movies Fish Tank and Red Road are n’t only female - gazy : they ’re actually about women looking at men .
It ’s no wonder , perhaps , that in the story linked above , Bret Easton Ellis admits that he is totally stymied by The Runaways and Fish Tank .
I imagine that for some men who are so used to having their perspective be considered the “ norm , ” the “ default , ” it can be disconcerting to see themselves removed from the center of the universe .
If art is meant to be disturbing — and we still think that way , do n’t we ?
that art should be unsettling ?
— men like Ellis should welcome a new viewpoint .
As should anyone who truly cares about film and TV as mediums for telling important stories .
You labor to fill the day with activities ; you create more tasks for tomorrow than the ones you have completed today ; you hyper - intentionally force productivity ( yet you have not defined what it is that you are trying to produce ) ; you make plans to make more money ; you make career plans ; you make retirement plans ; and you make plans to make more plans … .
But where are you going and what are you becoming ?
Are you merely surviving the day or are you living it ?
“ It is no measure of health to be well - adjusted to a sick society . ” ~ Jiddu Krishnamurti
If you are normal ( and normal is not healthy ) , you are struggling with the tension between who you are and the silent pressures of social conventions .
As a Chinese Proverb says , “ Tension is who you think you should be .
Relaxation is who you are . ”
This may not be a conscious struggle but it is certainly one that is being fought ; all at the expense of your self .
“ The greatest hazard of all , losing one ’s self , can occur very quietly in the world , as if it were nothing at all .
No other loss can occur so quietly ; any other loss — an arm , a leg , five dollars , a wife , etc. — is sure to be noticed . ” ~ Soren Kierkegaard
Your authentic self is slowly and quietly being covered by outside influences .
Social conventions tell you to study business ( not the arts ) , find a career that pays well , buy things , make more money , buy more things , save for retirement , stop working , and die at age 74 .
Sounds depressing and deterministic does n’t it ?
But this is not you …
Or is it ?
Surely this is not a description of The Change Blog reader , or the blogger who writes about personal development , or the person who lives and breathes the habits of Zen …
Or is it ?
Social conventions need not be those of your parents !
There are plenty of modern behaviors and distractions , including social media , for example , taking you farther away from your self every day :
You seek to be inspired — you seek to make some kind of change — or perhaps you seek to inspire others to change .
Do blogs , Twitter , Facebook , and Linked In help you to find yourself or do they provide short bursts of inspiration that are consumed quickly , leaving you hungry for more ?
They may help you to harness the power of now , but do they carry you forward to the next moment ?
There is an ever - present deluge of information and messages telling you to “ be somebody ; ” but is this somebody you ?
Are you perpetuating this message by telling others to be somebody ?
“ Happiness is your nature .
It is not wrong to desire it .
What is wrong is seeking it outside when it is inside . ” ~ Ramana Maharishi
We are all told ( and often believe ) that happiness is manufactured and productivity is created ; but happiness and productivity are not creations — they are results :
Like happiness , productivity “ happens ” and each is a natural byproduct of being and becoming the authentic self .
If , for example , you enjoy what you do , you are naturally willing to spend more time and energy on the particular activity … and be quite good at it !
You therefore become self - fulfilled and contented ; thus you spend even more time and energy on the activity .
This is true , radiating and self - feeding happiness and productivity … and it all begins with self - knowledge and self - awareness — not from the study of others ’ habits .
“ Money is only a tool .
It will take you wherever you wish , but it will not replace you as the driver . ” ~ Ayn Rand
Another silent and distracting message coming from social conventions occurs and recurs in the world of personal finance .
For example , the ultimate financial illusion ( I mean objective ! ) is financial freedom .
The abstract meaning of financial freedom is the acquisition of a sum of money large enough to replace income earned during your working years .
This idea of freedom is that your accumulated money will enable you to stop working and begin acting as your self .
But why must you stop working ?
Why must you wait decades to become your self ?
Why not be your self and work ?
Is this not true freedom , being the self ?
Conflicted , myself , between the financial and the philosopher , I began to ask myself questions : Can freedom be procured by financial means ?
Are there not people who consider themselves rich and free , yet they are in financial poverty ?
In contrast , are there not those who are financially wealthy but enslaved by physical world pursuits ?
Why must one sacrifice two - thirds of their life working in a career they do not love to reach a monetary goal , then discover that money is not the answer to life ’s questions ?
I stopped using financial planning software for clients and prospective clients last year because all it did was generate dozens of pages of reports that implicitly stated that the client must use their life as a tool for a money plan .
This is backwards !
Money is a tool for a life plan !
“ A human being is a deciding being . ” ~ Viktor Frankl
I discovered that all planning , whether it is financial , retirement , career or even for a vacation or holiday , is not about planning or plans — it is about being , knowing , acting as , and becoming the authentic self …
Here are a few other discoveries to help you form your own path ( actually these are not really discoveries — they are truths that already existed — truths that I uncovered once I removed the covers of social conventions , media noise and language ) :
There is no such thing as Financial Freedom
Money is a tool , not a goal .
Too many people make their life a tool for a money plan , whereas money should be made a tool for a life plan .
How many of your goals are money - centered ?
If you want to stop surviving and begin living , you must never make any goal centered upon money .
This is what makes the conventional idea of financial freedom such the paradox : People think that money buys freedom .
Actually , the pursuit of money creates a form of slavery ; and once this financial goal is reached , if it ever is reached , the tragic realization that freedom has not been obtained drains ( and slowly kills ) the authentic self .
Freedom , if properly defined , cannot be procured by financial means .
Form your own definition of freedom without any reference to money .
Define Words for Yourself
What is success ?
What is wealth ?
What is happiness ?
If the meanings of words are not defined by you , then you are following the paved road of social conventions .
If the path already exists , it is not yours .
A few years ago , I followed my own advice to define words for myself : I defined retirement , for example , as “ doing what I want , when I want , within reason . ”
At that moment , at age 37 , I realized I was already retired by my definition !
Of course , the key phrase is “ within reason ; ” but the realization that I was already retired , that my freedom was not defined by monetary means , was extremely liberating .
I discovered I was free , but not by monetary means !
Stop Planning and Start Discovering Yourself
If you spend your time and energy on aligning who you are with what you do , you will be on your way to true freedom .
The path to self - discovery never really ends but it is the producer of meaning and purpose ; therefore the persistent effort and long duration of the journey is actually welcomed , rather than disdained .
There is no hurry or proper entry point , just jump in !
Like career planning and financial planning , prudent self - discovery is a process of “ get rich slow . ”
In this case , however , “ rich ” is not a financial term — it is the state and trait of being and becoming the authentic self .
There is no career planning ; there is no retirement planning ; there is only life planning .
If there is something you would do for little or no money , what would it be ?
Do this thing as much as possible and be the best you can be at it .
Your honesty and self - feeding fulfillment will enable opportunities you ca n’t see at this moment .
There is no secret formula to life , and often the discovery of who you are is a process of discovering who you are not .
This is all the plan you need :
Make a slow and deliberate effort to find a career that is YOU .
“ I hope that posterity will judge me kindly , not only as to the things which I have explained , but also to those which I have intentionally omitted so as to leave to others the pleasure of discovery . ” ~ Rene Descartes
I could go on but I do not want to distract you any further from beginning ( or continuing ) your own path to a meaningful existence — of discovering , being and becoming your authentic self .
I also would love to hear about your path .
Who are you , where are you now and where are you going ?
Are you surviving or are you living each day .

Image caption Mr Adriaenssens said the seizure of case files had caused panic
A Catholic Church - backed commission of inquiry into clerical sexual abuse in Belgium has announced it is shutting down in protest at police raids .
Commission head Peter Adriaenssens said the commission had been used as " bait " by state prosecutors .
Offices were searched last week and all of the panel 's 475 case files removed .
Many of the files removed contained information from alleged abuse victims who had spoken in confidence .
Mr Adriaenssens , a child psychiatrist who only took over eight weeks ago , expressed concern at what could have motivated the authorities .
We received e-mails , telephone calls in the past few hours from people who are panicking about what will happen with their private details Peter Adriaenssens , Commission head
" They could only act in that way with the sentiment that we were in the wrong or that we were trying to conceal the cases , " he said .
" This while I made a point of working in complete transparency . "
Three raids were carried out on Thursday at the request of the Brussels prosecutor 's office .
Searches were conducted at the archbishop 's palace and the home of a former archbishop .
A number of bishops were detained for questioning and their phones , computers and other materials confiscated , a lawyer for the Mechelen - Brussels archdiocese said .
The Belgian Church was shaken in April when the Bishop of Bruges , Roger Vangheluwe , resigned and admitted to having sexually abused a boy before and after becoming a bishop .
' Panic calls '
" I 'm mostly shocked for all these people who gave us their trust , " said Mr Adriaenssens .
" And up until [ Wednesday ] evening , if they 'd asked me is it possible that they [ the police ] would arrive and take everything away , just take everything away , I would have reassured them [ that this would not happen ] . "
He added that people who had spoken to the commission in confidence were " panicking " .
" We received e-mails , telephone calls in the past few hours from people who are panicking about what will happen with their private details , " he said
" Will their parents find out ?
Will they read their story in the newspapers ?
Will their spouse , who was n't really aware , now find out via the media or the justice department ? "
On Sunday , Pope Benedict XVI denounced the raids as " deplorable " .
Belgian Justice Minister Stefaan
De Clerck responded to criticism robustly , saying normal procedures were followed .
" We must not turn this into a diplomatic incident , " he said .
" The bishops were treated completely normally ... and it is false to say that they received no food or drink . "
Editor 's note : Roland S. Martin , a CNN political analyst , is a nationally syndicated columnist and author of " Listening to the Spirit Within : 50 Perspectives on Faith , " and the new book , " The First : President Barack Obama 's Road to the White House . "
He is a commentator for TV One Cable Network and host of a Sunday morning news show .
( CNN ) -- Based on the hundreds of e-mails , Facebook comments and Tweets I 've read in response to my denunciation of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell 's decision to honor Confederates for their involvement in the Civil War -- which was based on the desire to continue slavery -- the one consistent thing that supporters of the proclamation offer up as a defense is that these individuals were fighting for what they believed in and defending their homeland .
In criticizing me for saying that celebrating the Confederates was akin to honoring Nazi soldiers for killing of Jews during the Holocaust , Rob Wagner said , " I am simply defending the honor and dignity of men who were given no choice other than to fight , some as young as thirteen . "
Sherry Callahan said that supporting the Confederacy is " our history .
Not hate ; it 's about heritage and history . "
Javier Ramirez called slavery evil , but prefaced his remarks by saying that " Confederate soldiers were never seen as terrorists by [ President Abraham ] Lincoln or U.S. generals on the battlefield .
They were accorded POW status , they were never tried for war crimes .
Not once did Confederate soldiers do any damage to civilians or their property in their invasion of the north .
The same is not true of Union soldiers . "
Realskirkland sent me a Tweet saying , " Slavery is appalling , but was not the only reason for the CW [ Civil War ] .
Those men , while misguided on some fronts stood up for what they felt was right .
They embodied that American ideal that the states have a right to govern themselves .
THAT is what a confederate soldier stood for . "
If you take all of these comments , do n't they sound eerily similar to what we hear today from Muslim extremists who have pledged their lives to defend the honor of Allah and to defeat the infidels in the West ?
When you make the argument that the South was angry with the North for " invading " its " homeland , " Osama bin Laden has said the same about U.S. soldiers being on Arab soil .
He has objected to our bases in Saudi Arabia , and that 's one of the reasons he has launched his jihad against us .
Is there really that much of a difference between him and the Confederates ?
Same language ; same cause ; same effect .
If a Confederate soldier was merely doing his job in defending his homeland , honor and heritage , what are we to say about young Muslim radicals who say the exact same thing as their rationale for strapping bombs on their bodies and blowing up cafes and buildings ?
If the Sons of Confederate Veterans use as a talking point the vicious manner in which people in the South were treated by the North , does n't that sound exactly like the Taliban saying they want to kill Americans for the slaughter of innocent people in Afghanistan ?
Defenders of the Confederacy say that innocent people were killed in the Civil War ; has n't the same argument been presented by Muslim radicals in Iraq , Afghanistan and other places where the U.S. has tangled with terrorists ?
We can't on the one hand justify the actions of Confederates as being their duty as valiant men of the South , and then condemn the Muslim extremists who want to see Americans die a brutal death .
These men are held up as honorable by their brethren , so why do Americans see them as different from our homegrown terrorists ?
The fundamental problem with extremism is that when you 're on the side that is fanatical , all of your actions make sense to you , and you are fluent in trying to justify every action .
Every position of those you oppose is a personal affront that calls for you to do what you think is necessary to protect yourself and your family .
Just as radical Muslims have a warped sense of religion , Confederate supporters have a delusional view of what is honorable .
The terrorists are willing to kill their own to prove their point , and the Confederates were just as willing in the Civil War to take up arms against their fellow Americans to justify their point .
Even if you 're a relative of one of the 9/11 hijackers , that man was an out - and - out terrorist , and nothing you can say will change that .
And if your great - great - great - granddaddy was a Confederate who stood up for Southern ideals , he too was a terrorist .
They are the same .
As a matter of conscience , I will not justify , understand or accept the atrocious view of Muslim terrorists that their actions represent a just war .
They are reprehensible , and their actions a sin against humanity .
And I will never , under any circumstances , cast Confederates as heroic figures who should be honored and revered .
No -- they were , and forever will be , domestic terrorists .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin .
It seems incredible that in the last days , a fundamental right of the whole of humanity , the freedom of association , has been denounced by the New York Times and all major opinion sources , even as a national political figure was reluctant to defend his own statements in favor of the idea , and then distanced himself from the notion .
Has such a fundamental principle of liberty become unsayable ?
Or perhaps it is not so incredible .
An overweening government , in an age of despotism such as ours , must deny such a fundamental right simply because it is one of those core issues that speaks to who is in charge : the state or individuals .
We live in anti-liberal times , when individual choice is highly suspect .
The driving legislative ethos is toward making all actions required or forbidden , with less and less room for human volition .
Simply put , we no longer trust the idea of freedom .
We ca n’t even imagine how it would work .
What a distance we have travelled from the Age of Reason to our own times .
Referencing the great controversy about the 1964 Civil Rights Act , Karen De Coster put the issue to rest by turning Rachel Maddow ’s question on its head .
She demanded to know whether a white businessman has the right to refuse service to a black man .
Karen asked : does a black businessman have the right to refuse service to a Klan member ?
I do n’t think anyone would dispute that right .
How a person uses the right to associate ( which necessarily means the right not to associate ) is a matter of individual choice profoundly influenced by the cultural context .
That a person has the right to make these choices on his or her own cannot be denied by anyone who believes in liberty .
The right to exclude is not something incidental .
It is core to the functioning of civilization .
If I use proprietary software , I ca n’t download it without signing a contractual agreement .
If I refuse to sign , the company does n’t have to sell it to me .
And why ?
Because it is their software and they set the terms of use .
Period .
There is nothing more to say .
If you run a blog that accepts comments , you know how important this right is .
You have to be able to exclude spam or ban IP addresses of trolls or otherwise include and exclude based on whether a person ’s contribution adds value .
Every venue on the internet that calls forth public participation knows this .
Without this right , any forum could collapse , having been taken over by bad elements .
We exercise the right to exclude every day .
If you go to lunch , some people come and some people do not .
When you have a dinner party , you are careful to include some people and necessarily exclude others .
Some restaurants expect and demand shoes and shirts and even coats and ties .
The New York Times includes some articles and excludes others , includes some people in its editorial meetings and excludes others .
When business hires , some people make the cut and others do not .
It is the same with college admissions , church membership , fraternities , civic clubs , and nearly every other association .
They all exercise the right to exclude .
It is central to the organization of every aspect of life .
If this right is denied , what do we get in its place ?
Coercion and compulsion .
People are forced together by the state , with one group required at the point of a gun to serve another group .
This is involuntary servitude , expressly prohibited by the 13th amendment .
One presumes that a freedom - loving people will always be against that .
As Larry Elder says : " This is freedom 101 . "
What about the claim that government should regulate the grounds of exclusion ?
Let ’s say , for example , that we do not deny the general right of free association , but narrow its range to address a particular injustice .
Is that plausible ?
Well , freedom is a bit like life , something that is or is not .
Slicing and dicing it according to political priorities is exceedingly dangerous .
It perpetrates social division , leads to arbitrary power , mandates a form of slavery , and turns the tables on who precisely is in charge in society .
In fact , for the government to presume to regulate the “ grounds ” of any decision - making is chilling .
It presumes the right and ability of government bureaucrats to read minds , as if they can know the real motivation behind every action , regardless of what the decision maker claims .
This is how banks in the last decades came to give out mortgage loans promiscuously : they were trying to throw off regulators looking for any sign of racial discrimination .
And , of course , this mind - reading trick is not arbitrary .
It is dictated by political pressure .
It is hardly surprising , then , that since the Act passed in 1964 , the grounds that the regulators say they can discern and thereby forbid have proliferated and are now completely out of control .
Has this strategy really increased social well - being , or has it exacerbated conflict among groups that the state has exploited to its own ends ?
But do we dare let property owners make such decisions by themselves ?
From a historical point of view , the injustice against blacks was perpetrated mostly by governments .
Private business does not go in for race - based policies , because it means excluding paying customers .
And this is precisely why racialists , nationalists , and hard - core bigots have always opposed liberal capitalism : it includes and excludes based on the cash nexus and without regard to features that collectivists of all sorts regard as important .
In the imagined utopias of the national socialists , the champions of commerce are hanged from lampposts as race traitors and enemies of the nation .
That ’s because the market tends toward an ever - evolving , ever - changing tapestry of association , with patterns that cannot be known in advance and should not be regulated by federal masters .
In contrast , government ’s attempts to regulate association lead to disorder and social calamities .
As Thomas Paine explained : “ In those associations which men promiscuously form for the purpose of trade or of any concern , in which government is totally out of the question , and in which they act merely on the principles of society , we see how naturally the various parties unite ; and this shows , by comparison , that governments , so far from always being the cause or means of order , are often the destruction of it . ”
This is precisely why libertarians were right to oppose these provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
They strike at the heart of freedom , and with an extremely high social cost .
One is not surprised that thoughtless and anti-intellectual organs of opinion would seek to deny this .
But what has surprised me is the speed with which supposed libertarians , especially in the ambit of DC , have been quick to distance themselves from the principle of the freedom of association .
I take this not as a measure of intellectual bankruptcy , but as a sign of the fear that so many have , in an age of despotic control , of speaking truth to power .

Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) has allowed scientists to watch areas of the brain “ light up ” in response to various stimuli .
And this has told them about where in the brain certain responses reside — like where fear resides .
But fMRI has limitations .
The lighting up of certain brain regions leads to increased blood flow to active areas , and this is what you see in an fMRI image .
But scientists only knew this as a correlation , not causation — meaning they were n’t sure if increased blood flow happened because neurons were firing .
But a study published today in Nature has finally brought vindication .
Using a technique called optogenetics , they were able to turn on genetically engineered brain cells in rats using a blue light delivered directly to those cells via an optic fiber .
And then they put the rats in an fMRI and saw that the blood flow indeed matched precisely those excited cells .
This shows that neural excitation is what produces the fMRI images of active brain areas .
Being able to control individual neurons with light has not only justified fMRI , but has opened up an entirely new way to study the brain .
Optogenetics works at micro scale , and fMRI covers wide regions of the brain — together this means that scientists have a way to intervene and experiment with entire brain circuits , to finally see how a certain type of brain cell affects the wider global activity of the entire brain .

There are new versions of the PlayStation 3 coming , with new hard drive sizes and new colours .
And as is custom , they 're hitting Japan first .
Advertisement
First things first : in Japan , the PS3 will cease to be made available in 120GB and 250 GB sizes , and instead come in 160 GB and 320 GB versions .
These new models will be released in Japan on July 29 , and for the first time will see the PS3 Slim available in two colours : the existing black and " Classic White " .
Advertisement
The 160 GB model will cost ¥ 29,980 ( USD $ 340 ) , while the 320 GB version will retail for ¥ 34,980 ( USD $ 400 ) .
As of now , details on this expansion to the PS3 range have been confined to the Japanese market ; we 'll update should we hear anything of Sony 's plans for the PAL regions or North America .
UPDATE -
As you 'd expect , both Sony Computer Entertainment America and Europe have nothing to say at the moment , telling us " We 'll consider every possibility based on the market demands , but have nothing to announce at this point in time . "
A nonstick alternative to Teflon® is baked enamel cookware , or porcelain cookware .
This cookware is inert at all temperatures , is dishwasher safe , and according to many professionals , cooks all types of food superbly .
Stainless steel , aluminum and cast iron are other alternatives , though these require cooking oil to prevent sticking .
If you own pet birds , Teflon® and nonstick cookware is not recommended .
Note that stovetop burner drip pans may also have nonstick coatings .
These drip pans can reach very high temperatures .
While DuPont remains insistent that Teflon® is safe and inert with proper use , it voluntarily pledged to substantially reduce environmental emissions and to phase PFOA out by 2015 .
DuPont also urges consumers to use Teflon® responsibly and considers overheating or burning food abusive use of the cookware .
Teflon® , and all cookware that uses nonstick coatings , should not be preheated .
Use low - to - medium heat and do not allow food or oil to burn .
According to peer - reviewed studies as reported by the EWG , nonstick cookware , including Teflon® , begins outgassing particles at 396 °F ( 202.2°C ) .
Related chemicals used in the process of non-stick cookware are sometimes referred to as " Teflon® chemicals " or perfluorinated chemicals .
This family of chemicals includes fluorotelomers , used in non-stick food packaging and stain resistant products for clothing , furniture , and carpets .
Fluorotelomers break down to PFOA in the environment and bloodstream , but PFOA does not break down .
Studies have revealed that 95 % of all men , women and children in the United States have traces of PFOA in their blood due to exposure to various industrial products that use this nonstick chemical .
PFOA has also been found in the environment and in wildlife .
DuPont ’s own research suggested a link between PFOA and rare birth defects in animals .
Of the seven pregnant women at the West Virginia plant , two of the seven babies born bore similar serious birth defects .
In response to the EWG petition , the EPA fined DuPont 16.5 million US dollars ( USD ) in December 2005 for failing to report the dangers of PFOA .
In April 2003 , the Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) filed a petition with the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to take action against DuPont for what it classified as an 18 - year cover - up regarding the dangers of the Teflon® chemical PFOA .
Factory workers exposed to PFOA inside the Teflon® plants had high levels of the manmade , indestructible chemical in their blood .
This included seven pregnant women and their fetuses , which also showed elevated levels of PFOA .
Though DuPont is quick to point out the safety of Teflon® and to distance it from the chemical PFOA , studies show Teflon® cookware releases PFOA when heated to 680 °F ( 360 °C ) .
This temperature can be reached fairly quickly , for example , a forgotten pan is left empty preheating on a very hot burner .
DuPont acknowledges this , but points out that this is incorrect use of the cookware .
One of the main chemicals used in the manufacturing process of Teflon® and other nonstick pans is perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) also known as C - 8 .
This chemical has led to cancer and birth defects in lab animals , and may have led to birth defects in DuPont plant workers .
In 2005 , an independent panel reporting to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) declared PFOA a likely human carcinogen .
Teflon® flu creates flu - like symptoms of chills , headache , fever and nausea .
Usually , symptoms subside within a few days , and chances are many people who have experienced it mistook it for the flu .
However , there are also more serious risks .
The nonstick coating used in DuPont ’s Teflon® pans has been found to release one or more of 15 different toxic gases when heated to certain temperatures , but is generally safe when used according to manufacturers ' specifications .
Which chemicals are released depends on the temperature of the pan .
This outgassing can be fatal to pet birds and can cause " polymer fume flu , " also known as " Teflon® flu , " in humans .

marxp October 24 , 2015 I inhaled a big dose of Teflon fumes - water evaporated from pan I was using to steam vegetables - about two weeks ago and have been suffering symptoms since , and they are not abating - sinus pain , some nosebleeds , watering eyes , itching eyes , chest tightness .
I have an overall sense of having been poisoned .
My response ?
Anger .
This stuff is highly toxic and I will not use Teflon again , knowingly .
Also , I do n't want to sit around waiting to get sicker .
I am looking at positive ways to detox these poisons outta my body .
A friend says sauna them out , so I 've joined a health club and start tomorrow .
Any other suggestions on how to detox ?

Here 's a tip for making breakfast that could be useful to those who fry bacon in a pan first , then fry eggs in the same pan second , and of course who wish to avoid teflon .
Thus is what follows .
I 'm talking about any kind of pan other than teflon coated , e.g. , cast iron , stainless steel , ceramic , even those old 50's era aluminum electric skillets .
For any of these you 've no doubt noticed that the bacon will leave adhering bits and a partly protein film .
This is what makes trouble with frying eggs since they will bond to this bacon residue .
To avoid this , and if you are n't afraid of aluminum , put down a piece of foil spanning the clean pan , and fry the bacon on that .
It actually works better for the frying itself than the bare pan because of improved heat distribution .
When the bacon is done , pick up the foil and spill off however much bacon grease you need for the eggs .
Now eggs cooked in classic form will be much easier to flip .

Teflon or any non -stick pan is not the biggest source of bad chemistry when cooking .
Take a look at what happens to the various cooking oils and foods when they get heated to 450 Deg F or higher .
There are all the food additives that are messing up our endocrine system .
In my humble opinion , if Teflon is treated with respect and used within reasonable limits the Teflon pans made in the last 10 years will be safe .
Warning : Cooking may be hazardous to your health .
anon939533 March 14 , 2014 I stopped using Teflon kitchenware years ago in an effort to reduce my exposure to toxins .
I use only stainless steel , cast iron and heat safe glass / crockery .
I really do n't have an issue with food sticking .
I cook on low or medium heat , depending on the type of food .
If it sticks , I soak the dish in hot , soapy water for a while , then go over it with a scrubber - voila , clean dish .
I can't help thinking an increasing number of folks are just plain lazy .
anon932303 February 11 , 2014 Chemophobia is the real culprit here .
anon924469 January 4 , 2014 I simply had to post once reading this .
I have a degree in physics and I do n't know of anyone who would describe me as delusional or over - paranoid when it comes to the toxicity of things .
Meaning I am not pedantic about safety .
( I use microwaves , etc. )
However , I can say with about 95 percent certainty that from the moment I have been using non-stick pans I have been getting sick and for years have been unable to explain it .
I switched them out and have honestly been feeling much better .
I do n't have night sweats , my cough has subsided , my headaches are gone and I do n't feel dizzy or lethargic .
I am still in disbelief that these are being sold .
It 's shocking .
I urge everyone to petition to their governments to have these banned .

All the people who continue to use teflon obviously have n't had teflon poisoning , and poisoning is what it is , not " flu . "
Having suffered from it personally , I will not have the stuff in the house !
It is n't just the cookware ; a lot of kids clothes , especially the school uniforms , are now impregnated with the damn stuff .
If you 're quite happy to have your kids walking around in a bunch of chemicals , breathing in the fumes when you have them in the dryer and cooking their meals in poison coated pans , then you carry on .
But more should be done to make people aware of the risks .

None of the comments on here show any sign of anyone searching for the real " truth " .
For example , one commenter said she does n't buy Tefal any more because of the dangerous chemicals from Dupont 's C - 8 .
Dupont does n't make the Teflon® for Tefal .
One commenter stated that the nonstick chemical was detected worldwide because of Dupont Teflon® frying pans .
3 M used this in all their Scotchguard fabric protection for carpets and clothing .
That 's how it got into the environment .
Dupont recycles all C - 8 it uses because it is very expensive to buy or make .
Panic and herd mentality is all this is .

We mostly use cast iron skillets .
Occasionally though , we do use a Teflon pan when sticking is an issue .
The pan has seen better days and we 've been looking for a replacement for some time .
But every time we 're in the store I always think " is n't there some kind of safety problem with Teflon ? "
Thanks to this article , we 'll never buy another Teflon anything .

I completely agree with the poster who talked about everyone arguing about the little things .
The fact of the matter is a company is selling a product that is harmful to our health : cookware !
It 's stuff that gets used on a daily basis .
Open your eyes , people .
What happened to the companies that made asbestos , or lead paint ?
The government shut them down and banned those materials and products .
Why ?
Because they are harmful to our health .
And we were n't cooking with asbestos or lead paint .
The next thing you know , people are going to say parents letting their kids eat lead paint chips are negligent .
Will people just wake up and open their eyes ?
The companies making teflon cookware do n't care about people 's health .
They have n't done all the research and only care about making money .
They care about taking money from our pockets .
The fact that just a little may come out in cooking is wrong .
Sure , only a little bit is released each time , but how many times a year do you use your teflon coated cookware ?
How many years will you continue using it ?
Do some math :
Take the number of times you have used your teflon and add it to the number of times you will use your teflon in future and multiply the small amount released each time you cook .
Calculate those numbers and you 'll find anyone who used teflon to cook is carrying around or will contain within themselves a large amount of these cancer causing chemicals .
All I 'm saying is we need to open our eyes , and wake up to the fact we are being sold harmful products just because companies make millions or billions .
Then these companies pay off the US government .
If anyone says companies do n't do that or that companies are not responsible , they are most likely an employee of one of the companies .
And if companies are n't responsible for the products they sell , I should be allowed to sell a gun without warning .
There is no difference .
We all know what a gun does , and we all know what cookware does .
That would be like me saying I 'm not responsible for my actions because I 'm just reacting based on other people actions .
Open your eyes to the truth , people !
Come on !

My husband just accidentally let water boil on a Pampered Chef nonstick pan - the nonstick surface is DuPont ( shame on Pampered Chef .
I thought their stuff would be better ) .
We were just sitting in the living room , when I asked him what was cooking ?
Then I saw the smoke hovering near the kitchen ceiling lights .
When I went into the kitchen to check things out , I realized it was the nonstick pan .
So , I freaked out and put it on the deck outside ( and tried not to breathe ) .
Then , my husband and I turned on all of the fans and opened all of the windows .
For years , he has wanted to buy nonstick pans .
But I know his forgetful ways , so I 've been putting my foot down .
Eventually he convinced me I was nuts and that it would be so nice to have a nonstick pan in the house .
So , I bought him one .
Now I regret that purchase .
Anyway , here I am with the windows open and I 'm sitting in an upstairs room next to an open window as I type , reading scary comments and hoping that I did n't inhale enough of those fumes to cause any poisoning .

For anyone who is interested , I have teflon coated pans but I also have had a minute piece of teflon in my head for 21 years .
It was placed there by a neuro surgeon when I had trigeminal neuralgia to separate a blood vessel from an artery which was causing me acute pain .
So far , this piece of teflon has never caused me any problems .
On the other hand , I have never overheated a teflon pan .

I was just wondering if you thought it was safe to add teflon dry lube powder to the gas mixture in my car .
I thought it would act as an upper cylinder lubricant .
I added some to the 8 quarts of oil my vehicle uses .
Actually , this was a dry lube spray that I bought from home depot and it said something about hydrocarbons as the propellant .
I do n't know , but I was feeling a little sick when I got home .
Now , I have a little dizziness and my head feels like it 's going to explode .
But , it might have to do with the fact that I also took a benadryl , dollar store ( rest and relax ) bottled drink with two cups of coffee .

While Teflon was still ' young ' in the 70s , we received a sample of ' mold release spray ' for injection molding machines .
Since we had no use for it , I took it home to use as a spray - on lubricant .
Living in Germany then , cigarettes were already costly so I made my own with a machine that used preformed tubes and an injector for the tobacco .
The shaped steel press that compressed the tobacco rubbed on the hard plastic case so I sprayed the case with the mold release spray , never considering that it might end up in the tobacco ; it did .
Over a period of weeks , I became weaker and had random headaches until finally one day I felt I might faint .
Our plant nurse checked my blood pressure and found systolic and diastolic pressures wide over the normal range and sent me toward home via taxi making it clear I was not to drive .
I stopped at two doctors ' offices ; the first found my BP very low , the second an hour later very high ; it was oscillating in waves .
The third doctor , who was quite young , had studied industrial poisoning and over the weekend , made a list of materials on which he queried me the following Monday .
Teflon was on that list and I immediately connected the spray and my cigarettes ; these produce momentary temperatures of up to 1100 degrees F . A component of Teflon when breaking down from heat bears a relationship to the ' nerve gas ' used in war .
It was weeks before my BP had somewhat stabilized and the cardiac arrhythmia I developed did n't subside for 30 years and then only because other cardiac problems required the use of Atenolol for treatment .
Needless to say , we have no Teflon cookware .

Heating coated cookware enough to degrade the coating is way past the flash point of most cooking oils , which means you will most probably set fire in your kitchen before having some polymer byproduct fumes in the air .

There is more dangerous stuff lurking in there .

As for post 10's couch analogy ?
Couches are n't designed to be placed over a flame for a prolonged period .

Yes , leaving a stove on unattended is a fire hazard .
But that 's not what these stories are about .
This is about the poison hazard , which is an entirely different issue and happens every time a pot is heated with nothing in it , while a fire is rare even under those circumstances .
There is a very real issue that people are trying to discuss , and calling them idiots and telling them to get out of the kitchen is ignorant of a significant danger and entirely off - point .
ra459 March 27 , 2011 I was in the USAF in the early 60's .
The earliest form of teflon was used back then for wire insulation in hi-temp locations .
We had an AF directive that came out in ' 62 that warned of the fumes from burning teflon to be deadly , citing the death of an electronics tech who had laid a cigarette on telon strippings in an ashtray at his workbench .

Putting saucepans on stove and letting them boil dry is negligent and the resulting fire could be far worse than the fumes from the burning Teflon .
The other thing is that we eat much more other unhealthy stuff , like too much oil and fat , too much salt , too much sugar and too much junk food .
We live in a polluted environment if we live in a large city .

Having teflon on your cooking utensils is one thing but how about eating it ?

Another surprising use is fireworks .
We all know what happens to teflon frying pans when they get too hot , but how hot does a firework get and how much teflon is in your average firework ?
I have written to various dental hygiene companies asking about their products contents and if they contain teflon .
The answer from one was to change their website so now you do n't know if their floss has teflon , but none have answered .

Or you tried to make popcorn in a Teflon pan and set it on fire in under two minutes ?
Given I 've never had a problem with any Teflon coated ( electric ) popcorn popper I 've ever owned , I 'd say you managed to start a grease fire that consumed non -stick coating .
I have special ire for the individual who recommends boiling water with baking soda and then tasting it .
Of course it tastes like crap , have you ever tasted baking soda ?
Why do n't you taste clean boiled water .
And really , boiled water in cast iron tastes bad ?
Why on earth would you boil water in cast iron .

If you had any clue about how to use cast iron , you 'd know it 's only as good as the seasoning process you 've put it through and that it 's terrible for liquids .
Cast iron for bacon , cornbread or steaks is fantastic however .
So to reiterate , if you can't be bothered to attend to your cookware while you have a fire operating or can't manage to keep it from otherwise melting .
perhaps you should stick to dry cereal or jars of Gerber baby food .

So , my story is not very frightening .
I have inhaled just a little bit of fumes , just a sniff .
And I was in the same apartment in the next room for about two hours after that ( having opened windows wide , of course ) .
I was really afraid of the symptoms other people reported here and took my temperature - it raised just a little bit , to 37C ( normal is 36.6 Celsius ) , which likely was due to placebo effect , so , i suppose , was the slight dizziness ( i really wound up myself quite a bit , reading too much stuff online and medical forums ) .
Then I went jogging for 40 minutes or so ( I figured , it would be better if I got more fresh air while my apartment was being ventilated ) and felt pretty well after that .
The bottom line is , I did n't get any of the hardcore symptoms which are usually associated with ' teflon fever ' , not in four hours , not during the next day .
So , if you have not been inhaling the fumes for a really prolonged amount of time , if you were not taking deep breaths of the fumes and were exposed to the fumes for a couple of minutes or so , chances are , you will not get sick .
Just take note of what you feel , take your temperature , just in case , go get some fresh air and do not overreact .
And , of course , try not to do stupid things like leaving non-stick cookware heating empty .
I put my pan on the heater , and then some things distracted me and I ended up reading some JavaScript - related blog in the next room until I smelled the smoke .
If you cook - you cook , do not mess around with heaters .
And if you have burned your non-stick pan and the lid is on the pan - do not take it off and sniff it like I did - it's an impulse of habit you 've got to resist .
Hope this post helps someone in the same situation as was mine .
Here you go , folks : I inhaled a bit of fumes and lived , so there 's hope for you .
Do not get too frightened .
P.S. I am most certainly not saying that inhaling the stuff is safe .
It says online that the fumes contain two military - grade poisonous gases .
I think that 's a big concern , and DuPont should really come up with a new non -stick polymer which has much higher melting temperatures .
This many cases of poisoning has to make them think again about what they are selling .

anon85944 May 23 , 2010 I am still recovering from my bout with the so - called Teflon Flu ( Its really a toxic poisoning . )
I was boiling water , went outside for a few minutes , came back inside the house and deeply inhaled a most awful , gagging smell of chemicals .
As if that were n't bad enough , I sniffed around the kitchen even more to find where the smell was coming from .
It was coming from the pot that the water was boiling in - it had not boiled dry .
I quickly took the pan outside .
About seven hours later , I started to feel burning in my chest that lasted about 5 1/2 hours .
That subsided , but my stomach was very sore .
A few hours later , I got the most intense headache imaginable , started vomiting , and was really very sick .
My husband called my mom , and they debated whether to take me to the Emergency Room .
The vomiting continued for about four hours , and the headache lasted three days .
During this time I was extremely exhausted .
This exhaustion , the scatter - brained or floaty head feeling , and sensitive stomach continued .
I finally went to see the doctor ( two days ago ) , told him what happened with the pan , and he confirmed that I indeed was suffering from the toxic effects of this Teflon pan .
I am now undergoing treatment to get rid of these toxic substances from my body .
Why is it okay for these things to be sold ?
For us to buy and expose ourselves and our families to ?
These reports are n't new .
According to my doctor , there have been reports as early as 1975 .
Tell you family and friends , for their own sakes , to throw away their non -stick pans .

Last night , I fell accidentally fell asleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 4 a .m. to an extremely hot living room / kitchen and a red hot burner with a scorched non -stick tefal pan .
It appears I nodded off on the couch waiting for water to boil .
I am horrified .
I must have slept for almost six hours , breathing the toxic fumes for six whole hours .
I quickly turned off the burner and opened the balcony door to ventilate .
I stayed outside for a good hour just getting fresh air .
My apartment smells like burnt chemicals and plastic .
The smell is in everything fabric .
When I took a shower I could smell it all over my skin .
I appear to have developed the polymer fume flu - headache , an unproductive cough which developed about eight hours after I woke up and opened up the door to ventilate .
I keep having hot flashes mixed sweats and mini-fevers .
My eyes are burning and I have bad sinus pain and a headache .
I have lower back pain in my kidney area under my ribs .
I feel nauseous , and I can taste the chemical smell in the mucus drainage from my sinuses .
My heart is racing , probably from the exposure and from the anxiety of reading all the horrible things about Teflon and its breakdown products when superheated .
I immediately phoned our local poison control , who said to make an appointment to see my physician , but that I would probably be OK .
Apparently this happens a lot to seniors and old folks .
When I saw my physician he said I have inhalation exposure and that the amount of teflon coating on the pan was very small and I was lucky that I did n't start a fire .
I have two small cats who appear to be unaffected .
My doctor said that it is a good sign that the cats are OK , but if they died or got sick , then I should get myself to a hospital asap .
I have thrown out my non -stick tefal pans and will only ever cook with stainless steel and always use an egg timer when using the stovetop !

I sprayed Teflon for 2 1/2 years .
I and everyone in my dept .
got sick every day for about two to three hours after work .
After I left that job I started having shortness of breath problems .
It got worse every year .
I do not smoke .
Now I take medication three times a day for COPD .
I think it was the Teflon , but I can not prove it .

I had a neighbor who was in the middle of a law suit with dupont because of lung damage and cancer .
She had let her pan boil dry and became very ill from the teflon fumes .
She lived for five years after this happened and never did get to settle in court .
I wonder if teflon is causing so many of our young people to have add , adhd , ocd and other learning problems .
I know more kids on meds now than ever before .
Something is causing it .
anon47143 October 2 , 2009 I remember several years ago DuPont had agreed to to phase out Teflon cookware .
But the Bush administration must have let them get out of it or extend the already generous time frame to sell it down .
Now it 's extended to 2012 ?
DuPont has a gazillion bucks ; I think they can afford to get out of the cookware business if they can't find a safe alternative non-stick coating .

I 'm pretty sure I left my pan unattended for over 3 hours , this past Wednesday morning in my one - bedroom apartment .
It 's now Friday and I 'm still having chest pains .
And I coughed up some phlegm with blood this morning .
I really do n't want to go to the doctor , being that they said in the article that the symptoms will go away .
But it almost feels like bronchitis .
Anyone else have any input ?
anon35744 July 7 , 2009 how about the smoke caused by an unattended teflon pot that SOMEONE forgot and was left burning on the stove for 3 hours ???
I am concerned for my dogs and cats !

Thanks to this article .
I now know why I became very sick , and why my 9 year old Cenegal parrot , Rico , died .
I came home from work just the other night , hungry and tired .
I decided to put on a pot of water to make some pasta .
I sat on the couch and within 2 minutes I nodded off .
I woke up an hour or so later to a horrible stench lingering through the house .
I ran to the kitchen to find the pot , which was a teflon coated product , empty and sizzling on the hot stove .
I retreated the pot to the back burner and opened the windows .
Devastated by the chance that I could have burned my house down , I decided just to go to bed .
Before heading to the bedroom , I noticed Rico laying on the bottom of his cage , dead .
I was very disappointed at myself since I had a slight feeling that what I had done may have contributed to his death .
Saddened , I went to bed around 1 am .
6:30 am , I awoke to an extremely nauseating feeling in my stomach .
I went to the bathroom where I was forced to vomit .
My head ached miserably , and I was very short of breath .
Attempting to get a couple of more hours of sleep , I headed back to bed .
Thirty minutes later , I started shivering .
Then sweating .
My heart was beating rapidly .
I felt extremely ill .
Finally , I was up for the day , felt like I had gotten the flu .
I refrained from going to work .
I knew that somehow what occurred the night before was causing me to feel this way .
After research on the internet , my curiosity was over .
Apparently teflon is harmful both in humans and sadly , our pets .
Fortunately , the " teflon flu " symptoms only lasted 24 hours .
But I assure you , I will be discarding all my teflon products and replacing them with new ones .
Thank you for the information .

This year , I ’ve eaten mountains and mountains of these freakish , skinny spikes .
They pop up everywhere , like those annoyingly smart kids in class with their arms up after every question .
This fabulous springtime gift keeps on giving here in mid-May , and can be manipulated in many ways .
Just do n’t ask me how to manipulate the smell of asparagus urine .
( I hear it ’s genetic . )
I cooked about 75 of these fougasse for the Athens Farmers Market last Saturday and they were a real crowd pleaser .
It ’s called a “ Stuffed Fougasse ” ( Foo- gaazzz ) , mimicking an Italian calzone but French in origin .
I , of course , have taken this idea on a peculiar path in my continuous effort to bastardize every recipe known to humans .
This recipe is spectacularly Goonish in its richness and crunch .
It can easily be put into your back pocket for ease of travel ( depending on how large your ass is ) .
Stuffed fougasse in its vertically larval stage and after , in its beautifully transformed “ butterfly - gasse ” stage .
This asparagus fougasse is a folded package of 7 - ounce dough stuffed with a pudding made of whole - milk ricotta cheese , sauteed leeks , blanched whole grain mustard seeds , Dijon mustard , chopped pistachios and grated Parmigiano - Reggiano .
The key is to constantly taste the pudding mixture until it suits you .
I then cover it with a little Gruyere .
I do this because my convection oven turns the cheese pudding dark brown .
The asparagus will cook beautifully for 7 to 10 minutes at 450 degrees on a parchment - covered upside - down cookie sheet that has been pre-heated .
( Note to buyers of commercially raised asparagus : you may want to take a potato peeler and skin those corporate spears to make the asparagus less “ bark - like ” before cooking .
See directions on this previous post . )
That is my insitefully meticulous recipe .

This Friday , June 25th , it will have been sixty years since the beginning of the Korean War in 1950 .
After decades of Japanese occupation , Korea was divided in two by Allied Forces at the end of World War II , with the south administered by the U.S. and the north by Soviet Russia .
Deep divisions built over several years , leading to skirmishes and finally an invasion by North Korean troops on June 25th , 1950 .
The United Nations sent troops and support from 21 countries to support South Korea , primarily from the United States and Britain .
The war lasted for three years , with large advances and retreats on both sides , and many casualties .
Hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers were killed .
The two Koreas are technically still at war since hostilities ended in a ceasefire , not a peace treaty in 1953 .
Though it is often referred to as " The Forgotten War " , I hope this collection of photographs helps us to remember the events of 1950 - 53 , those involved , and the legacy that still remains , sixty years later .

The Jist is an art , philosophy , and culture zine released quarterly .
Surely you ’ve heard the ads , wedged between Steve Poizner ’s cries of “ Liberal ! ” and Meg Whitman ’s attempts to sound tough .
“ And we do n’t even have the right to vote on it ! ” whine the indignant actors , as if they ’re victims of an evil government conspiracy .
Do n’t be fooled .
These ads , like the rest of PG&E ’s estimated $ 45 million campaign to pass Proposition 16 , are full of lies .
PG&E calls the measure the Taxpayers ’ Right to Vote Act , but it ’s really the PG&E Monopoly Protection Act .
So we ca n’t resist another reminder to vote no .
The proposition would force local governments to gain approval from two - thirds of voters before creating a local utility , like those in Santa Clara and Palo Alto , or a community choice energy program like the one Marin just started .
PG&E wants voters to believe it ’s just making sure they have a say .
What a crock .
If that were the case , it would have set the vote threshold at a simple majority .
We might even have supported it .
But a two - thirds requirement means the will of 66 percent of voters can be thwarted by 34 percent , making any proposal easy to defeat .
Do n’t take our word for it .
PG&E ’s CEO told shareholders that the purpose of Proposition 16 is to save the expense of fighting every city that wants to defect .
Groups like the Chamber of Commerce should be ashamed about backing this scam .
The fact is some government utilities are beneficial to the public .
Ask anybody from Santa Clara if they ’d like to trade their city utility for PG&E , whose residential customers , by one estimate , pay an average of 84 percent more per kilowatt hour than Santa Clara residents .
Voters already have a lot of opportunities to weigh in on big decisions like forming utilities , which do n’t happen overnight .
There are public meetings , and often a bond measure is needed .
Residents can circulate petitions for a referendum if a bad plan gets passed .
But these projects are often started not by government run amok but at the behest of residents who want sources of power that are cheaper and greener than what PG&E provides .
One thing that ’s clear about PG&E ’s campaign is where it got the $ 45 million for all those ads .
From you .
Unless you ’re lucky enough to live in a PG&E - free city like Santa Clara .
Exercise your right to vote on Proposition 16 : Say no .
Tell PG&E to stop spending your money to thwart your best interests — and to stop lying .
" The question must be admitted whether the immense costs that , for example , arise from excessive consumption of food , can be permanently paid out of the consolidated health system , " said Marco Wanderwitz , the conservative MP for the state of Saxony .

Any ideas ?
Via : WREG :
Something is killing crops , trees , even weeds and nobody can explain why .
Farmers are scratching their heads and some are worried their crops may be lost to the mysterious plague .
It ’s happening along a large swath of land near the Shelby and Tipton county border along Herring Hill Road and elsewhere near the Mississippi River bottoms .
Tiny dots appear to have burned onto leaves of all types of plants , and they appear different depending on the plant .
On corn stalks , the dots seem to turn white in the center .
On other plants , a white dust speckles the leaves and then destroys the green life underneath .
“ We found it all in the herbs , in the flowers , in the plum tree , in the weeds , ” said organic farmer Toni Holt .
“ It ’s apparently in everything . ”
Holt grows organic produce that she sells at area farmers ’ markets .
As she and other farmers inspect the new growth covered in the perplexing plague , they fear their entire crop may be lost .
Less than ten miles from Holt ’s crops , the damage could possibly hit hundreds of acres of corn at Wilder Farms .
It appears to have hit everything in its path .
There does not seem to be anything in common with the affected plants .
The Holts raise organic crops , so they do n’t spray pesticides on any of their fruits and vegetables .
The first thought among some was a new parasite or insect caused the damage , but Wilder farms sprays pesticides and the damage there is exactly the same .
Farmers first noticed the damaging dots over the weekend .
Then Holt came home to find baby birds dead in their nests .
“ There are two dead birds hanging out of two different bird houses , so we ’re concerned about that .
We do n’t know if it ’s related , but it ’s alarming , ” said Holt .
“ We ’ve got horses , we ’re concerned about the horses on the grass .
We ’ve got chickens .
We sell our eggs at the market . ”
Farmers we spoke with are convinced something in the air caused this damage .
They ’re asking the USDA and other experts to look into the problem , and so are we .

This is a page about how I got my HTC Evo ’s Battery life to extend from 5 hours to 12 + hours .
This highlights everything you need to do :
How I saved a bunch of battery by making these changes to my HTC Evo
This is what I did to get my HTC Evo ’s battery from 5 hours to give or take 12 hours of constant use ( Depends on how you use it 4G Obviously will kill the battery faster ) .
I have yet to try it on only standby .
This is how I did it including links .
Note : Doing all this you will see no difference in your phones performance other than battery life .
First lets start with the “ look ” of your HTC Evo .
Change your wallpaper to a nice solid preferably dark color but any non live wallpaper will do .
Then make it so that you only have 1 - 3 syncing widgets on all of your homescreens / widgets that in general update themselves without you doing anything .
The Main HTC Widget that comes on the first homescreen is actually the best one to have as it will automatically update itself even if you do not have the Widget on a homescreen so I am just keeping that one .
After you have done that you will need to do one of the most important things that will give you some insain battery life .
Make 6 Widgets ( You should already have 4 of these but make the other two ) for Airplane Mode , 3g , 4g , Wireless , Bluetooth , and GPS .
You can make this by either holding your finger down on the homescreen on a blank spot or click the + in the bottom right hand corner of your screen .
Got to Shortcuts > Settings > then tap on the one that you want to make into a widget , make a widget of Airplane Mode , 3G , 4G , Wireless , Bluetooth , and GPS .
Now do n’t get lazy on me , you need to turn on / off each one when not in use this is an extremely important part , If your not using a setting TURN IT OFF !
You will doing this save quite a lot of battery .
And if your not using 3g or 4g turn on airplane mode , this will stop your Evo from looking for the signals saving tons of battery life .
You can still turn on Wi -Fi so all your apps that need internet will still work .
This is great if your going to sleep and leave your Evo on as an alarm clock .
Go into Settings ( By hitting the menu button on a homescreen then settings ) > Sound and Display > Brightness >
And change it to 10 % or less on the bar I keep mine almost as low as possible then change it higher when I ’m outside in the sun .
Then go to Settings > Sound and Display > Notification Flash and turn it off all the ones you will not need to be notified right away .
This will save battery because of the waste of all the energy to keep that light blinking for useless things .
Go to Settings > Account&Sync>
And click on all the accounts under manage accounts that you do not need to sync .
And after that turn off Background Data and Auto - sync IF AND ONLY IF you want to manualy sync your Email , Sms , Ect .
This helps A LOT but will become a pain in the butt .
You do not need to use this to get 12 Hours but you could get much more battery if you do .
Also if it does n’t bother you turn off the touch screen keyboards vibrate ability , to be more clear whenever you hit a button on the onscreen keyboard the phone vibrates .
This wastes battery if you are fine just typing and not having your phone move around underneath you so to turn this off go to Settings > Language & Keyboard > Touch Input > Text Input > and turn off Vibrate when typing .
Now for the most important parts , Go to Settings > Wireless & Networks >
Wi-Fi and click off Network Notification .
You do n’t need to have your phone constantly looking for different Wi -Fi networks when your already connected .
You will see no difference but you will save on battery .
Go to Settings > Wireless &Network > Mobile Networks and turn off Data Roaming and Enable always - on Mobile Data .
Data
Roaming you always look for the best signal for service so it uses a lot of power and No one knows what Always - on Mobile Data does but it saves a lot of battery and I have seen no difference in performance .
Then after you do this go to Data Roaming and if you have a good sprint service where you are turn Roaming to Sprint only ( Basically turning it off ) this makes your phones extremely efficient as it does not look for the highest service and uses the least amount of energy looking for a signal .
It seems that some EVOs were incorrectly set to GSM before they were shipped .
This causes the phone to constantly search for a GSM network to connect to , which of course drains the battery .
To check the preset network type on your EVO , bring up the dialer and press * # * # 4 6 3 6 # * # * to open a Testing menu .
Tap “ Phone information ” and scroll down until you see “ Set preferred network type ” followed by a drop - down menu .
If “ GSM auto ( PRL ) ” is selected , then tap it and choose “ CDMA auto ( PRL ) ” instead .
Reboot your EVO and make sure your choice is still active .
After all that you should have great battery life but you have to “ Root ” your device to get the most out of it .
Go to this link with your HTC Evo ’s build in browser .
http://unrevoked.com/
now after you download the app run it and you should now have a “ Rooted ” phone .
You cannot install custom Roms but you can install apps that you can only use on a rooted phone .
Go and get the [ Overclock Widget ] ( http://www.androlib.com/android.application.org-freecoder-widgets-overclock-zww.aspx) , it is free and allows you to change the speed of your CPU to fit how hard you are working it so it uses the least amount of Battery .
This saves a lot of battery life .
Now put the Overclock Widget on your homescreen tap it and go into advanced settings .
Make the Min for “ Screen On Freq Setting ” 576000 and the Max for 998400 .
Turn on “ Differ Freq Screen Off ” and go to the “ Screen Off Freq Setting ” And make the Max and Min 245000 .
In the “ Advanced Settings ” Turn on “ Use Your Frequencies ” .
Go to “ Operation ” and click on “ Auto start on boot ” and then hit Save .
Your almost there !
Now all you have to do is go to Settings > Sound & Display > Screen timeout and turn it to 30 Second .
Lastly download from the Market “ iGauge Battery ” to check your battery level .
Now make a few more shortcuts .
Shortcuts > Settings > and make two shortcuts one for Running Services and Battery use .
Running Services so you can turn off all those wasting apps and Battery use to monitor your services that are using your battery and to see how long you have been unplugged .
Now We all Know about AutoKillers so head on over and download http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-rechild-advancedtaskkiller-jCEw.aspx.
Once Downloaded open it up and look for these files you have to put on your ignore list or else all your hard work fallowing this guide is for nothing .
Look for the apps currently running called “ Advanced Task Killer Free ” “ OverclockWidget ” and “ Superuser Permissions ” then long tap ( Hold click whatever you want to call it ) on each one and click ignore .
This will allow these apps to not be killed by the AutoKiller .
Go around and do the same thing to your other apps that you do n’t want to be closed .
After that hit the Menu button >
Settings and turn on Autostart under “ Startup ” .
Then scroll down to “ Autokill ” switch the Auto Kill Level to Safe and turn the Auto Kill Frequency to Whenever the screen turns off .
Now another problem is Partial Wake which is when your phone ’s display is off but Wifi , 3G , ect are still on and running .
This sucks out unneeded power just to keep those programs updating .
To do this type again * # * # 4636 # * # * in your dialer .
Then go to Battery Usage > Other Usage > Patial Wake Usage .
After you do that look underneath for any apps that are still running .
If you fallowed this guide you should n’t see any that you specifically have n’t allowed to keep running because you should have turned off auto sync ect earlier in the guide .
But if you see anything running that is taking more than 5 % batter either uninstall it , Make sure Autokiller sees it and can stop it , or turn off its autosync .
There is a but that has Flickr autosync perminantly keeping your phone on Partial Wake Mode .
To turn this off go to Settings > Accounts & Sync >
And click the green circle next to Flickr to turn it off .
( Thank Stillaftermath for showing me this )
Now whenever your not using your phone just put it into sleep mode by hitting the power button and your done !
You will now get 12 Hours of Battery of Constant use with your HTC Evo the phone that people say has bad Battery life .
You sure showed them !
Also not only is your Battery life Amazing but it charges crazy fast too .
The fastest I got it to charge was in 2 hours from 5 % battery left .
That was with All Radios Turned off ( Wifi , Bluetooth , 3G , 4G , GPS , and in Airplane Mode ) .

Questions to Make this “ Guide ” Better :
Is there any app that lets me see my Battery level * and * time my phone has been uncscreenshot ( Already got app ) and post my results because right now I ’m using two different apps to keep track of eachharged ?
So I can take athing .
( iGauge for battery level and shortcut to running apps for how long its been unplugged )
If you have any other suggestions please comment .

NOTE : * Still working on this Guide it will constantly change .
I will Blog about the Changes .
I concluded my earlier remarks on rigged markets and captive markets by offering this quick gloss on the free - market anti-capitalist thesis : that the recognizable patterns of capitalist economics result from the fact that certain key markets – importantly , the labor market , housing rental market , and other key markets are rigged markets – and in particular , indirectly - created captive markets , in which working - class folks in need of houses or jobs are driven into a market where they are systematically stripped of resources and alternatives , faced by artificially high costs , and generally constrained to negotiate with incumbent market players who have been placed in an artificially advantageous position over them through repeated government interventions in their favor .
Claims like this – that big government tends to disproportionately benefit big business at the expense of ordinary workers , by creating rigged markets and concentrating access to resources – may be controversial in libertarian circles now ; but they are hardly unusual in the long view of libertarian history .
Before the 20th century coalitions against the New Deal and Soviet Communism , libertarian writers , from Smith to Bastiat to Spencer , had little interest in tailoring their politics to conservative or pro-business measurements .
They frequently identified capitalists , and their protectionist policies , as among the most dangerous enemies of free exchange and property rights .
The individualist Anarchist Benjamin Tucker , writing in 1888 , [ ] called for Absolute Free Trade … laissez faire the universal rule , while describing this doctrine of complete laissez faire and free competition a form of Anarchistic socialism .
Let ’s bracket discussion of that semantic decision for the moment ; the important contribution is Tucker ’s identification and analysis of four great areas where government intervention artificially created or encouraged class monopolies – concentrating wealth and access to factors of production into the hands of a politically - select class insulated from competition , and prohibiting workers from organizing mutualistic alternatives .
The Big Four monopolies Tucker identified as central to the Gilded Age economy were :
The Land Monopoly – government concentration of ownership of land and natural resources through the enforcement of legally - fabricated land titles ( such as preferential land grants to politically - connected speculators , or literally feudal land claims in Europe ) .
Since Tucker , the land monopoly , already key to the Gilded Age economy , has radically expanded – with the frequent nationalization of mineral and fossil fuel resources throughout , and the emergence of local zoning codes , complex housing construction codes , land - use restrictions , “ Urban Renewal , ” municipal “ development ” rackets and Kelo - style eminent domain seizures , and a host of local policies intended to keep real estate prices high and permanently rising .
In a freed market , land ownership would be based entirely on labor - based homesteading and consensual transfer , rather than on military conquest , titles of nobility , sweetheart “ development ” deals , or eminent domain seizures , and land would tend ( ceteris paribus ) to be more widely distributed , with more small individual ownership , dramatically less expensive , with more ownership free and clear , and could as easily be based on sweat equity and homesteading of unused land , without the need for any commercial cash exchange .
The Money Monopoly – government control over the money supply , artificially limiting the issue of money and credit to a government - approved banking cartel .
Tucker saw this as the source of both monopoly profits for the incumbent banks , and the artificial restriction of access to capital to those large , established businesses which the large , established banks preferred to deal with , while suppressing competition from mutual credit associations and other means by which workers might be able to pool their own resources and access credit on more advantageous terms than those offered by commercial banks .
Tucker , in 1888 , was writing about the Money Monopoly before the Federal Reserve or the conversion to a pure fiat currency , before the SEC , FDIC , TARP , banking holidays , bailouts , or the myriad other means by which government has insulated big bankers and financiers from market consequences , or erected regulatory barriers to entry which insulate politically - approved business models from market competition .
The Patent Monopoly – government grants of monopoly privileges to patent - holders and copyright holders .
Tucker argued that patents and copyrights did not represent a legitimate private property claim for their holders , since it did not protect any tangible property that the patent - holder could be deprived of , but rather prohibited other market actors from peacefully using their own tangible property to offer a good or service that imitated or duplicated the product being offered by the holder of the so - called Intellectual Property .
These prohibitions , enforced with the explicit purpose of suppressing market competition and ratcheting up prices , in order to secure a long period of monopoly profits for the IP - holder , now constitute more or less the entire business model of Fortune 500 companies like General Electric , Pfizer , Microsoft , or Disney , and have only gotten longer and harsher in their legal sanctions , as IP monopolists have insisted on the need for more and more insulation from free market competition .
The Protective Tariff – Tucker identified the tariff as a monopoly in the sense that it artificially protected politically - favored domestic producers from foreign competition .
While the tariff has declined noticeably in political and economic importance since the 1880s , tariffs remain a distorting force within limited domains ( for example , agriculture ) , and the specific mechanism of import tariffs is much less important , for Tucker ’s purposes , than the overarching aim of protecting connected incumbents – whether through tariffs on incoming foreign goods , export subsidies to outgoing domestic goods , through political manipulation of fiat currency exchange rates , or through other means .
As I ’ve tried to indicate , Tucker ’s Big Four remain pervasive , and at least three of those four have in fact dramatically expanded their scope and invasiveness since Tucker ’s original description of them .
If we were to try to make a similar list of all the major ways in which local , state , federal and foreign governments now intervene to protect incumbent interests and place barriers to entry against potential competitors , there ’s no knowing how many monopolies we ’d be dealing in ; but I think that there are at least four new major monopolies , in addition to Tucker ’s original four , which are worthy of special notice for their pervasiveness and importance to the overall structure of the state - regulated economy .
First , the agribusiness monopoly : since the New Deal , an extensive system of government cartels , subsidies to ratchet up prices for sale in American markets , more subsidies to artifically lower prices for export , surplus buy - up programs , [ ] irrigation projects , and the like have tended to ratchet up food prices for local consumers , to make importing and exporting produce over tremendous distances artificially attractive , to distort agricultural production towards the vegetable and animal products that can most successfully attract subsidies and government support projects , to favor large - scale monocrop cultivation over smaller - scale farming , and generally to concentrate agriculture into factory farming and industrialized agribusiness .
Second , the security monopoly : because of government ’s massive expansion of standing military forces , and paramilitary police forces , the past century has seen the creation of a gigantic industry full of monopsonistic , government - driven rigged markets , with nominally private companies subsisting largely or entirely on tax - funded government contracts – companies like Lockheed - Martin , General Dynamics , Raytheon , the rest of the military - industrial complex , and the growing number of companies ( such as Taser ) who cater primarily to government police forces or other Homeland Security agencies .
Third , the infrastructure monopoly : that is , federal , state , or local government monopolization , tax subsidies , and allocation of access to transportation and communications infrastructure .
So , for example , the monopoly offers a benefit to big - box retailers like Wal - Mart , whose business models are enabled by , and dependent on , government subsidies to road - building and maintenance , and the resulting artificially low costs of long - haul trucking .
Similarly , incumbent media companies have built empires in part because access to broadcast bandwidth has been restricted and politically allocated through the FCC , while access to cable , telephone , and fiber - optic bandwidth has been tightly controlled and restricted through local governments ’ monopoly concessions to incumbent cable and telecommunications companies .
Fourth , we might add regulatory protectionism : the proliferation of commercial regulations , government bureaucracy and red tape , business license fees , byzantine tax codes , government - enforced professional licensure cartels and fees ( for everything from taxi- driving to hair braiding to interior design ) – all of which , cumulatively , tend to benefit established businesses at the expense of new upstarts , to protect those who can afford the fees and lawyers and accountants necessary to meet the requirements from competition by those who cannot , and generally to the poor out of enterpreneurial opportunities , independent professions and more autonomous alternatives to conventional wage labor .
In addition , we should also mention the structural effects of mass criminalization , incarceration , and deportation of socially or economically marginalized people .
Activist libertarians have often condemned , on a moral level * the government ’s War on Drugs , or Border Apartheid , or other government efforts to criminalize the poor and subject them to imprisonment for victimless crimes .
As well they should — these government wars are nothing more than massive violence and cruelty directed against innocent people .
But there has not yet been enough recognition of the structural , economic by - products of government policies which , for example , lock 1 out of every 3 African - American men in a cage , potentially for years at a time , taking away years of their working life and permanently stigmatizing them as they try to reenter the labor market and civil society , or which constantly threaten undocumented immigrants with the threat of arrest , imprisonment , and exile from their homes and livelihoods .
Such massive government violence , dispossession , and constraint on livelihoods is sure to have massive impacts on the conditions under which many poor and legally - vulnerable people enter into labor markets , housing markets , and all other areas of economic life .
This is , of course , only the beginning .
You could easily subdivide some of these monopolies into smaller monopolies ; and there are no doubt many more broad classes of monopoly which could be mentioned .
But I think that Tucker ’s Big Four , which are still present and have mostly grown in their size and importance since Tucker ’s day , and these new Big Five , alongside them , get us a lot closer to understanding why so many markets work the way they work .
They are , in any case , enough to make the point , and also to raise some likely objections from conventionally pro-capitalist libertarians , which we had better deal with before we spend too much time elaborating on the subject .
I ’ll be turning to some of those objections in the next instalment .
Mr Ging said the attack was the latest sign of growing levels of extremism in Gaza .
He said it provides further evidence " of the urgency to change the circumstances on the ground that are generating such extremism . "
A 13 - year - old Pennsylvania girl was treated in the hospital after police say she had an at - home abortion with a lead pencil before giving her fetus to her 30 - year - old boyfriend to bury .
Hospital officials in Polk Township called authorities when they were treating the girl they believed to be “ recently pregnant . ”
When they questioned the child , she admitted to aborting her baby with the pencil earlier that week .
According to a criminal complaint 30 - year - old Michael Lisk , believed to be the child ’s boyfriend , instructed her to “ push really hard ” while having the contractions until the child gave birth on a toilet .
Police report that Lisk then instructed the girl to wrap the fetus in a plastic bag until he arrived to bury it in his backyard .
When police arrived to question him , he reportedly dug up the body for them and described his relationship with the child as a “ marriage where you have sex all the time . ”
He faces charges of rape of a child , statutory sexual assault , involuntary deviate sexual intercourse , aggravated indecent assault , corruption of a minor , concealing the death of a child and abuse of a corpse .
The girl has not been charged and is still receiving medical treatment for her injuries .

PORTLAND – A woman who told police that she was raped by a group of black men Monday night alongside the Back Cove trail admitted Tuesday that she made up the story , said Police Chief James Craig .
Police issued a summons ordering Maryanne Morin , 22 , of Portland to appear in court to face a charge of filing a false report , a misdemeanor punishable by as much as one year in jail and a $ 2,000 fine .
Morin could not be reached for comment Tuesday night .
Additional Photos Police Chief James Craig holds a news conference Tuesday along Back Cove to appeal for witnesses to come forward in a rape reported in the area , a few hours before the woman admitted she made up the story .

Before learning that the woman had changed her story , Craig held a news conference at Back Cove and appealed for witnesses to come forward .
He became furious later Tuesday , and said he will push for the maximum punishment .
“ I pride myself on being transparent and educating the community on crime so they can be safe , but when it ’s a false report of a crime , it creates unnecessary anxiety , ” Craig said .
“ Then , when you attach a false reporting of a particular race , it even creates another situation suggesting a particular group is responsible for a particular type of crime , ” he said .
Morin initially reported that she was walking on the trail along Baxter Boulevard at 9:30 p.m.
Monday when five black men in their 20s started making lewd comments to her .
They then grabbed her , held her down and sexually assaulted her , she told police .
Morin said they ran when a passing motorist yelled at them .
She reported that she made her way home and told her roommate , who called police .
The report was startling because Back Cove is a popular place for joggers , walkers and bicyclists and attracts hundreds of people on summer evenings .
There were other aspects of the case that raised questions .
For instance , police said , Morin refused to go to the hospital , where health care workers could have collected DNA samples to aid in the investigation .
Police confiscated her clothing to examine it for evidence , but could not force her to go to the hospital , said Lt. Gary Rogers .
Police said they must treat such reports as credible until they ’re proven otherwise , and officers doubted that someone would make up such a horrendous story .
Craig said that because of the severity of the alleged crime , he opted to hold a news conference Tuesday afternoon in the Preble Street Extension parking lot , at the south edge of the trail .
As Craig was appealing for witnesses , detectives were re-interviewing Morin .
She admitted to making up the story , he said later .
Morin told officers that the report was related to a fight she had had with her partner , though Craig could n’t explain her motivation beyond that .
Craig would not comment when asked whether the department or any officers should have scrutinized her report sooner and more carefully .
The incident feeds some residents ’ suspicions and reinforces prejudice , Craig said .
When he meets with groups of elderly Portland residents , many complain about escalating crime and blame it on immigrants , Craig said .
He points out that , statistically , the vast majority of crimes in the city are not committed by immigrants .
Morin is black , Craig said , but the racial implications of the false report remain .
“ A bias is a bias and it ’s wrong , ” he said .
Rachel Talbot Ross , president of the Portland chapter of the NAACP , called the incident “ heart - wrenching . ”
“ It continues to support the notion that race is a proxy for criminality , ” she said .
“ We ’re feeding into racial stereotypes that encourage fear of African - American men . ”
Although one would hope that a black woman would know better , racism can exist even within a race , she said .
“ That ’s how insidious racism is .
There is an element that is internalized , ” she said .
The incident also could make it harder for victims of sexual assault to be taken seriously , said the head of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
Craig said his officers will continue to treat reports of sexual assault very seriously , regardless of this incident .

Update , 10 June 2013 : Vindicated !
I ’ve been in San Francisco for a day or so , on my way up to O’Reilly ’s Foo Camp .
This in itself is already happy - making , but when I found myself jetlagged and wide - awake in yesterday ’s dawny gloaming and realized where I was ( three blocks from the flagship Apple Store ) and what day it was ( !! ) , my schedule for the day was foreordained .
I performed quick ablutions , picked up a tall coffee to go , and met free - at - last Tom Coates a little after six in the morning , on what was already a nontrivial line .
Lots of free energy drinks , doughnuts , and burritos and eight hours later , I was ushered into The Presence ; after the usual provisioning and activation hassles , I left the store with a gorgeous , brand - spankin ’ - new iPhone 4 .
And it truly is gorgeous , y’know ?
In its formal qualities , this Mk IV represents a significant advance over the last iteration — which I never cared for , as it looked and felt cheap — and a return to Jony Ive ’s long - term effort to reinscribe a Ramsian design ethic in the market for 21st century consumer products .
As an object , it just about can not be faulted .
Mmmmm .
Oh , but that interface .
Or more particularly , the design of applications and utilities .
The worrisome signs that first cropped up in the iPhone 3G Compass app , and clouded the otherwise lovely iPad interaction experience , are here in spades .
What ’s going on here is an unusual , unusually false and timid choice that , in the aggregate , amounts to nothing less than a renunciation of what these devices are for , how we think of them , and the ways in which they might be used .
I ’m talking about the persistent skeuomorphic design cues that spoor applications like Calendar , Compass , iBooks and the truly awful Notes .
The iPhone and iPad , as I argued on the launch of the original in 2007 , are history ’s first full - fledged everyware devices — post - PC interface devices of enormous power and grace — and here somebody in Apple ’s UX shop has saddled them with the most awful and mawkish and flat - out tacky visual cues .
You can credibly accuse Cupertino of any number of sins over the course of the last thirty years , but tackiness has not ordinarily numbered among them .
Dig , however , the page - curl animation ( beautifully rendered , but stick - in - the - craw wrong ) in iBooks .
Feast your eyes on the leatherette Executive Desk Blotter nonsense going on in Notes .
Open up Calendar , with its twee spiral - bound conceit , and gaze into the face of Fear .
What are these but misguided coddles , patronizing crutches , interactively horseless carriages ?
Lookit : a networked , digital , interactive copy of , say , the Tao Te Ching is simultaneously more and less than the one I keep on my shelf .
You give up the tangible , phenomenological isness of the book , and in return you ’re afforded an extraordinary new range of capabilities .
Should n’t the interface , y’know , reflect this ?
A digital book read in Kindle for iPad sure does , as does a text saved to the ( wonderful , indispensable ) Instapaper Pro .
The same thing , of course , is true of networked , digital , interactive compasses and datebooks and notepads .
If anything , the case is even less ambivalent here , because in all of these instances the digital version is all - but - unalloyed in its superiority over the analogue alternative .
On the iPad , only Maps seems to have something of the quality of a true network - age cartography viewer .
I want to use the strongest language here .
This is a terribly disappointing renunciation of possibility on Apple ’s part , a failure to articulate an interface - design vocabulary as “ futuristic ” as , and harmonious with , the formal vocabulary of the physical devices themselves .
One of the deepest principles of interaction design I observe is that , except in special cases , the articulation of a user interface should suggest something of a device , service or application ’s capabilities and affordances .
This is clearly , thoroughly and intentionally undermined in Apple ’s current suite of iOS offerings .
What Apple has to do now is find the visual language that explains the difference between a networked text and a book , a networked calendar entry and a page leaf , or a networked locational fix and a compass heading , and does so for a mass audience of tens or hundreds of millions of non-science - fiction - reading , non-interface - geek human users .
The current direction is inexplicable , even cowardly , and the task sketched here is by no means easy .
But if anybody can do this , it ’s the organization that made generations of otherwise arcane propositions comprehensible to ordinary people , that got out far enough ahead of the technology that their offerings Just Worked .
Application interfaces as effortlessly twenty - minutes - into - the - future as every other aspect of the iPad experience ?
Now that truly would be revolutionary and magical .
I do n’t think it ’s too much to ask for , or to expect .
Despite the squawks of the Conservative party , a programme about the history of heckling was transmitted on Monday on BBC3 .
The party 's head of communications , Guy Black , had protested that the BBC had departed so far from its duty of impartiality that three hecklers had been fitted with microphones and incited to shout : " Michael Howard is a liar " , " You ca n't trust the Tories " , and " You can only trust Tony Blair " .
Being marooned in a house which cannot get BBC3 I was unable to see this programme , but the information in the Tory complaint struck me as very odd .
What on earth does the shouting of these prearranged slogans have to do with the art of heckling ?
This is n't heckling : it is simply abuse , heckling 's meagre and impoverished second cousin .
One needs to ask , as no doubt the programme did , what heckling means .
The primary definition refers to processes in the textile trade , where to heckle was to tease or comb out flax or hemp fibres , to go through them , as might be said , with a fine - tooth comb .
The leap across to the secondary meaning - to interrupt political speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions - was made in Scotland , and specifically perhaps in Dundee , a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and stroppy element in the workforce .
By 1800 , according to an account by Graham Ogilvy in Billy Kay 's anthology The Dundee Book , they were already operating as a powerful trade union .
To some extent , a local employer noted in 1809 , they controlled the trade , dictating wages , conditions and bonuses ( mostly taking the form of drink ) , all enforced by combination and strike .
The heckling shop , said another observer , was frequently the arena of violent harangue and ferocious debate .
One heckler would be given the task of reading out the day 's news while the others worked .
What they did when they moved from factory floor to public meeting had a second relevance .
" Heckling " then was a method of firing off questions designed to tease or comb out truths that politicians might wish to conceal or avoid .
Perhaps the most famous heckle of the last 50 years was uttered by some anonymous hero in the dockyard town of Chatham , where Harold Wilson was making a speech .
Having hymned the nation 's maritime glories , Wilson asked what he meant to be a purely rhetorical question : " And why am I saying all this ? "
To which a voice from the back of the hall replied , " Because you are in Chatham " - thus teasing , if not yanking , out the essential truth that Wilson was simply buttering them up because he wanted their votes .
The best of the heckling , though born out of animosity , was seasoned by spontaneous wit .
And the best of the victim speakers enjoyed it : they would seize on a heckle and turn it by some crowd - pleasing retort to their advantage .
Wilson himself - as quoted in Brewer 's Politics , edited by Nicholas Comfort - was an acknowledged expert in this technique .
Heckler ( interrupting a passage in a Wilson speech about Labour 's spending plans ) : " What about Vietnam ? " Wilson : " The government has no plans to increase public expenditure in Vietnam " .
Heckler : " Rubbish ! " Wilson : " I 'll come to your special interest in a minute , sir . "
Heckler ( a supporter of white supremacy in Rhodesia ) : " Why are you talking to savages ? "
Wilson : " We do n't talk to savages .
We just let them into our meetings . "
But while letting a heckler in was one thing , letting a heckler dominate was quite another .
That was graphically demonstrated at a meeting in the Fulham byelection campaign of 1986 .
Denis
Healey , the star attraction , in his ripest , most rubicund form , suggesting a man who had come direct from a rather good dinner , was repeatedly assailed by a spirited heckler - I think over Ireland .
Eventually , gazing on him benignly , Denis suggested that since he had such firm views on the way these things should be run , perhaps he would like to tell us what he would do were he in charge .
Old hands gasped .
They knew the rule that you must n't ever offer the floor to your opponent .
Leaping on to his chair and launching a torrential tirade , the heckler seemed unstoppable , until a staunch staff member of the party newspaper Labour Weekly set off a slow handclap which drowned him out .
Interruptions from individual hecklers , as opposed to disruptive claques , used to be one of the lures to turn up at political meetings .
Since nowadays spontaneity has been more or less steamrollered out of such open public meetings as still occur , the art of the cut - and - thrust intervention and the sharp unplotted riposte has more or less disappeared .
The gaiety of nations is diminished by its demise .

BREAKING SOUNDS : Nots 3 LP
Killer Memphis noise punk band NOTS strikes again with their signature brand of poignant paranoia on their third album 3 . ” Roughly 30 minutes of minimalist No-wave terror emerges from the forceful , impending doom of political commentary delivered over hellscape post - punk .
Throbbing bass , psychedelic stabbing guitar , spooky synth , and ever - steady drums are cloaked in a vocal echo that slaps back exponentially with gang - vocal poetry that rattles around your brain , back and forth between the left and right ears , until the next song tugs you into another dark , inescapable chamber .
It ’s as if NOTS wants to teach society a lesson .

ALBUM STREAM : Nun The Dome LP
It is instructive that NUN released their first single five years ago with a track named ‘ Cronenberg ’ .
Their new LP THE DOME opens with a track named ‘ Wake In Fright ’ , and presents a conceptual framework inspired by R. Buckminster Fuller that arms the record with a cohesive horror .
On THE DOME , NUN ’s development echoes the first wave of post - punk and Industrial music , from the malevolent broken electronics of Throbbing Gristle to the sensual trance of Chris and Cosey , or Human League ’s journey from the turgid grind of ‘ Being Boiled ’ to the giddy synth - pop of DARE .

VIDEO FEED : Passions : The Mick Ronson Story
With all the well deserved hype about the Beside Bowie documentary , ( just released on Hulu ) do n’t overlook another gem .
In a 2017 episode of the UK TV series Passions , Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet visits Ronson / Bowie historical sites , while interviewing Bowie fans and associates .
Kemp ’s eloquent and wonderfully melodramatic presentation is sometimes funny , in its painfully sincere deification of his hero .
When interviewing John Cambridge of pre-Bowie band The Rats , I was floored to hear clips of another early 70 ’s heavy metal project called merely Ronno .
Fitting , because Ronno is some trademark Mick Ronson balls out rock ‘ n ’ roll !
What , ...

TRACK PREMIERE : Cafe Racer " Two Times A Day "
Chicago 's Cafe Racer have come a long way over the past few years , from the remains of the glorious Gross Pointe , known as one of the city 's finest noisy garage punk bands , came this vastly different new project from Michael Santana ( and an entirely new ensemble ) , who have made huge strides in an immensely challenging new direction .
Gone is the desperation - packed punk grovel and sneer , and in comes the luscious hypnotic waves of Jesus And Mary Chain - style phenobarbital downer grooves .
" Some Candy Talking " is the reference point here , and it 's great pivot stylistically , and their intense ...

BREAKING SOUNDS : Holograms Surrender LP
Stockholm 's icy minimalists , and abysmal post punk envelope - pushers , Holograms are back with Surrender , their third full - length and first for Push My Buttons , and its just in time for the winter freeze to set in here in America .
Jutting out from behind a thunderous backbone and delicate and spidery guitar interplay , you instantly hear Robert Smith 's inflection , but Holograms are really a lot more complex than a simple rip off , as each track develops it's own personality , and it just gets darker and bleaker from there .
From jarring post punk anthems to somber and sludgy death rock cavity - fillers , this ...

RIP : David Peel - NYC Legend / Punk Icon
I wish I could say something profound in memory of David Peel .
If there was a Brain Lapse # 2 , he would have been interviewed along with Giorgio Moroder ( the bubblegum years ) , the October Cherries guys , and the Hudson Brothers .
But now David ’s dead .
It speaks volumes that Peel is completely unknown outside of counterculture circles .
As an artist , he was dismissed and ignored .
The Trouser Press Record Guide could have squeezed him in between their entries for the Pedaljets and Pegboy … but they did n’t .
The 1300 + page All Music Guide to Rock omitted him in print between Ann Peebles ...

Mark … Thank - You for you contribution !
We are all motivated in one way or another and we can all inspire and influence others – this is human nature .
Working on an under - funded difficult project with an overworked team however it may not seem this way !
While there no are no magic - motivation wands here are a few considerations that may help .
People are Smart
What do people have to gain from being part of a project ?
If the answer is nothing they will figure this out pretty quickly and all the tricks in the books wo n’t help .
In some management training people are taught to manipulate others but unless a genuine win-win is offered this wo n’t get you very far .
Start by assuming people are smart and offer them something they need .
It ’s all About Needs
There are no lazy people , only people meeting their needs in ways you may not like .
Human needs are universal , not strategies for other things and are what drive all human behavior .
As a project manger ( dare I say leader ) ask what needs you can meet with limited resources .
If you have no budget to reward people , do n’t panic – financial rewards are actually very poor motivators compared to intrinsic rewards .
Creativity , appreciation ( a “ thank you ” does n’t cost a penny ) , meaning , respect , autonomy , consideration , belonging and fun are all big drivers for example .
Can you tap into any of these on a project to bring out the best in people ?
Meaning and Emotional Management
What inspires and motivates people is not normally facts and data but emotional content .
What is the “ heart ” of a project ?
How can you connect the big picture of what people care about to the daily grind to make it meaningful … and well , less of a grind ?
Authentic Management
If you believe in a project and are authentic and passionate about it you will inspire others .
Motivation begins at home and leadership is n’t a set of tricks but about who you are .
Get your own motivation in order and others will follow .
Note that words not enough to do this and that you must build leadership presence through passion , experience and embodied practices to really motivate .
Matrix Team Management
Working with virtual or matrix teams brought together for a short period also presents certain challenges .
The lack of embodied communication distance creates should be avoided where possible with face - to - face meetings being best with Skype , phone and e-mail in descending order of usefulness in motivating .
In such contexts the importance of listening and good communication skills is paramount .
Time and time again I have seen technically proficient leaders fail because they lack the necessary people management and leadership skills .
Good quality management training is necessary to build this skill set ; it wo n’t just come naturally for most people .
So : assume people are smart , look for win-wins , meet people ’s intrinsic needs , appeal to emotions , get your own house in order and watch out for disembodied communication and poor listening and you ’ll have no problem motivating even “ lazy ” people .

You might have heard that Mark Twain ’s autobiography is going to be published this fall — the real one , not the abridged , expurgated , censored , compromised , cleaned - up , Sunday school superintendent version that ’s circulated over the years .
5,000 pages of sheer bile , cussedness , and truth - telling is what ’s promised , and I ’m ready to pre-order Volume One .
Twain famously stipulated that it not be published till one hundred years after his death in 1910 , and here we are .
How time flies when you ’re destroying America !
It seems like only yesterday when we were an embiggened nation and had some great people among us .
They were n’t the majority , of course , but the ones we had were prime .
Especially that fierce Civil War era crop .
Besides
Twain there was , lessee , off the top of my head , Abraham Lincoln , and Frederick Douglass , and Ulysses S. Grant , and William Tecumseh Sherman , and John Brown , and Harriet Tubman , and Ambrose Bierce and …
That ’s not so many , you say .
Oh yeah ?
Try naming eight great Americans living right now .
G’head .
Try it .
Okay , try naming three .
I remind you that Johnny Cash already kicked the bucket and Hunter S. Thompson shot himself .
But Muhammad
Ali ’s still alive , so that ’s one .
Oh , and Cesar Milan became an American citizen , did n’t he ?
So that ’s two .
In the unlikely event that you can think of a third candidate , please forward your bright idea to sic@exiledonline.com .
When the publication of the Twain autobiography was announced , the press tended to focus on certain eye - popping details the tome reveals about the author ’s old age .
The electric sex toy bought for him by his secretary / mistress , Isabel Van Kleek Lyon , for starters , and the colorfully insulting language he used to describe her after the affair ended .
Apparently it is n’t generally known that Mark Twain was an old rip .
Which means people are n’t reading Twain anymore , or anyway , they are n’t reading him with any real attention to detail .
Even the milder stuff assigned in high school English classes is ripe , blasphemous , hilarious , and heartening .
Sure , they do n’t assign you Twain ’s “ Some Thoughts on the Science of Onanism ” .
But The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is plenty lively , with exhilarating stuff on every page .
Here , for instance , is Huck ’s first - person description of his father , the malevolent town drunk :
He was most fifty , and he looked it .
His hair was long and tangled and greasy , and hung down , and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines .
It was all black , no grey ; so was his long mixed - up whiskers .
There war n’t no color in his face , where his face showed ; it was white ; not like another man ’s white , but a white to make a body sick , a white to make a body ’s flesh crawl — a tree - toad white , a fishbelly white .
As for his clothes — just rags , that was all .
This is why kids should study literature .
It does a child good to read a frank , straightforward assessment of a parental figure like that .
It means you do n’t have to lie to yourself , see ; you can acknowledge , in your own mind , what you ’re experiencing , even if you have to disavow it aloud in order to get along in society .
Huck ’s all for the necessary lie , even the merely convenient lie , which provides cover while you ’re making plans to escape whatever rotten situation you ’re stuck in through no fault of your own .
He conveys the genuine danger of being honest with others :
I says to myself , I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks , though I ain’t had no experience , and ca n’t say for certain ; but it looks so to me , anyway ; and yet here ’s a case where I ’m blest if it do n’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie .
I must lay it by in my mind , and think it over some time or other , it ’s so kind of strange and unregular .
I never see nothing like it .
Well , I says to myself at last I ’m a - going to chance it ; I ’ll up and tell the truth this time , though it does seem most like setting down on a keg of powder and touching it off just to see where you ’ll go to .
You know who ’d understand Twain , and could get him across to these addled new generations ?
The Coen brothers .
They ’re the filmmakers who could actually get away with putting Huckleberry Finn — notoriously un-adaptable — on screen .
They ’re working on True Grit right now ( adapting the Charles Portis novel , not remaking the wacky John Wayne movie version ) , which would be good practice , getting them into the properly tough - minded period mood to do Twain .
They ’re not afraid of episodic structures , strong dialects , regional specificity , humor and horror inextricably mixed , honest representations of weird American ways .
And they were already inspired by Twain in their creation of the cowboy Stranger played by Sam Elliott in The Big Lebowski ; by their own account , they were trying to evoke the “ earthiness ” of Twain .
Always on the right track , those guys !
( Hey , I almost forgot the Coen brothers !
That ’s two more great not - dead Americans , so we ’ve got four .
Woo - hoo !
Do I hear five ?
Anybody ? )
Most film and TV adaptations of Twain ’s work are mushy and coy and filled with cheap Americana that makes you feel tired , with everyone saying “ Shucks ! ” all the time .
So far the only decent Twain adaptation I know of was a brilliant six - minute mash - up on The Simpsons with Bart as Tom Sawyer and Nelson as Huck Finn .
( I wish I could remember more precisely the dialogue about the harsh - sounding food of the 19th century South .
Something along the lines of , “ You want some cornpone ?
Flapjacks ?
Hardtack ? Fatback ? ” )
You have to admire Twain for having the savvy to suggest that his uncensored autobiography is such hot stuff , such pure Tabasco , it must be withheld from the public for a century , when presumably everyone savaged in its pages would be long gone .
Twain knew the drama of the deathbed memoir ; he ’d arranged to publish the memoirs of his friend and personal hero , Ulysses S. Grant .
Grant achieved the most epic deathbed - memoir ever , famously writing it while dying in agony from cancer of the throat .
Bad investments and fraudulent business partners had bankrupted Grant , and he wanted the money for his family .
He finished the weighty tome just days before expiring , and he saved his family from penury , and he got a lot of posthumous raves from admiring critics and military experts , who said , essentially , “ Hot damn , he sure was a clear thinker and a good describer of strategy and tactics and battles for a guy dying in agony from cancer of the throat . ”
People did stuff like that then , sometimes ; heroic stuff .
This is not to say that reading 5,000 pages by elderly Mark Twain will be any picnic , even for his biggest admirer ( me ) .
Late - life
Twain is pretty rough .
By then he was , as they always say , “ bitter . ”
Like his pal Grant , he got swept up in the get - rich - quick fever of the Gilded Age and lost his shirt , as well as his house , and had to go on endless speaking tours to try to recoup .
His beloved wife Olivia died ; his children kept dying too ; only one of four outlived him .
As his notoriously high “ animal spirits ” faded , his affection for reprehensible humanity dissipated as well , and he began to roast them unsparingly in prose .
He ’d come to hate the Christian God too , and went after him “ with a pen warmed up in Hell . ”
All perfectly understandable , but you still have to brace yourself a bit when a great writer attacks .
Here ’s what old Mark Twain thought of humanity : “ Oh , we are a nasty little lot — and to think there are people who would like to save us and continue us .
It wo n’t happen if I have any influence . ”
There ’ll be lot more like that in the autobiography , reviling us for what liars we are , what cowards , what fools , what hypocrites , what sycophants , what conformists , what cruel bastards , what greedy sloppy pigs , with apologies to pigs for insulting them .
But it ’ll be good for us to read .
Twain is exactly what we need right now , a necessary corrective .
We ’ve revived all the rotten vices of the Gilded Age , but with none of the ferocious virtues that made it interesting .
We ’re more damnable now than when Twain was alive , which he would ’ve hardly thought possible , but there it is .

Almost besting Morgan Spurlock ’s supposed discovery of Osama bin Laden as 2007 ’s most insane pop-cultural crossover , Vanity Fair is reporting that Beck might have played a tangential role in the double suicide of artists Theresa Duncan and her boyfriend , Jeremy Blake .
In January ’s issue , Nancy Jo Sales traces the last steps of the couple leading up to their deaths this past July .
According to Sales , Duncan was devastated after the singer reneged on a promise to star in Alice Underground , a film she was directing .
“ Beck and I met repeatedly to discuss the film , ” she e-mailed a friend in 2003 .
But when he backed out later , she blamed it on his being a Scientologist and claimed members of his church repeatedly harassed her and Blake .
( The VF story says she complained about late - night hang - up phone calls and weird men staking out the couple ’s house . )
“ We never met to discuss doing her film , ” Beck writes in an e-mail to VF , referring to Duncan as “ a passing acquaintance . ”
Weird , though , because Duncan had pictures of herself and Blake enjoying a day at the beach with Beck and his wife , Marissa Ribisi , purportedly taken in 2004 .
( VF even published one of them . )
Duncan reportedly said that Beck had told her he wanted to leave the Church of Scientology and thought starring in her movie might be a way to do it .
“ [ Beck ] really , really tried to get away…using going to New York to be in Alice Underground … He told me he wanted to leave the cult desperately . ”
Wrong again , says Beck : “ That ’s ridiculous .
Totally false …
Had we been closer and discussed anything as personal as religion , I would have only had positive things to say about Scientology . ”
But now blogger Emmanuelle Richard points us to a translated 2003 Italian interview with Beck that seems to undermine his credibility a little .
Here he is talking excitedly about making his acting debut in a movie that sounds a lot like Duncan ’s Alice Underground :
“ It will be full of energy and full of characters : some kind of Alice in Wonderland set in the seventies .
It still does n’t have a title .
The director is a friend of mine , and it will be her directorial debut .
But I trust her .
We will begin shooting in the fall . ”
The controversy does n’t end there , apparently .
Blog SoMA reports that the Vanity Fair article ’s original author , John Connolly , was pulled off the story , and it was given to Sales , who ’s the ex-wife of Father Frank Morales , a friend to Duncan and Blake who was there when Duncan ’s body was discovered in her East Village apartment .
What the hell is going on here ?
We have no idea !

How Well Did Beck Know Theresa Duncan and Jeremy Blake ?
WASHINGTON -- Former Canadian press baron Conrad Black won a significant , but incomplete legal victory Thursday when the United States Supreme Court vacated an appeals court ruling that upheld his 2007 convictions on defrauding Hollinger International Inc .
In a decision that could affect dozens of other white - collar crime cases in the United States , the high court found flaws in the controversial “ honest services ” statute used to prosecute Mr. Black on charges of mail fraud .
His case has been remanded back to the Chicago - based 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to be reconsidered .
“ He knows of the news and is quite elated by it , ” Miguel Estrada , Mr. Black ’s Washington - based lawyer , said in an interview .
“ We are coming to the end of a long and painful period . ”
Mr. Estrada said he will seek bail for Mr. Black , who is serving a six - and - a - half - year sentence in a Florida prison , within the next few days .
The ruling in Mr. Black ’s case came in tandem with a separate , but related , decision in the fraud case of Jeffrey Skilling , the former chief of failed energy giant Enron Corp .
The Supreme Court set aside Skilling ’s own honest services conviction and placed new limits on a law prosecutors have relied on to pursue American executives accused of corporate malfeasance .
In Mr. Black ’s case , the court found that instructions to the jury at his 2007 trial rested on an “ improper construction ” of a section in federal fraud law which makes it illegal “ to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services . ”
The 28 - word Criminal Code provision was central to Mr. Black ’s conviction on three counts of mail fraud for arranging US $ 6.1 - million in payments to himself and his associates from Hollinger International , where he was chairman and CEO .
In its ruling on Skilling , which guided its decision in Mr. Black ’s case , the Supreme Court determined that the honest services provision “ properly confined , criminalizes only schemes to defraud that involve bribes or kickbacks . ”
The Supreme Court said in a footnote to its ruling that the fraud scheme alleged at Mr. Black ’s trial did not involve bribes or kickbacks .
The high court said instructions given to the jury at Mr. Black ’s trial were “ indeed incorrect ” and that defence lawyers had the right to raise objections on appeal , overturning the finding by the appeals court .
Mr. Black ’s convictions on mail fraud still “ technically ” stand , said Mr. Estrada , but the Supreme Court ’s determination on the limits of the honest services provision throws the jury verdict into question .
“ While the jury verdict has not been technically vacated , it has been found to be in error , ” Mr. Estrada said .
“ The convictions should be tossed ...
It is literally impossible for the government to establish that the error [ at trial ] did not harm Conrad Black . ”
Mr. Black had appealed to the Supreme Court jointly with John Boultbee and Mark Kipnis , his ex-colleagues at Chicago - based Hollinger International Inc .
At Mr. Black ’s trial , the Supreme Court noted , the jury was told Mr. Black and his co-defendants were guilty of honest services fraud if they misused their positions for private gain and “ knowingly and intentionally ” breached their duties of loyalty to the company .
Whatever the outcome of the Jon Burge perjury and obstruction of justice trial , the legal battles that have swirled around him for more than 20 years , and that have cost the city millions of dollars , will drag on .
“ Not only legal battles , but political battles , ” said Flint Taylor , who represents several men who accused Mr. Burge and others of torturing them while at Area 2 violent - crimes unit of the police department on the Far South Side in the 1970s and ’ 80s .
“ This is just one phase in the long struggle against police torture . ”
The jury will resume deliberations Monday , and Mr. Taylor said that he plans to file a federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Burge , Mayor Richard M. Daley , LeRoy Martin , a former police superintendent , and the “ cast of characters ” who worked as detectives under Mr. Burge , 62 .
The suit will be filed , he said , on behalf of Ronald Kitchen , a Burge accuser whose murder conviction was overturned .
Meanwhile , Representative Danny K. Davis , Democrat of Illinois , is pushing for federal legislation that would make police torture a federal crime without a statute of limitations .

Machine Learning Tutorial Lecture Spectral clustering is a technique for finding group structure in data .
It is based on viewing the data points as nodes of a connected graph and clusters are found by partitioning this graph , based on its spectral decomposition , into subgraphs that posses some desirable properties .
My plan for this talk is to give a review of the main spectral clustering algorithms , demonstrate their abilities and limitations and offer some insight into when the method can be expected to be successful .
No previous knowledge is assumed , and anyone who is interested in clustering ( or fun applications of linear algebra ) might find this talk interesting .
A footlong cheeseburger for $ 4 .
You can't beat that with a stick hardened artery !
I mean you could , but that would be f*** ing disgusting and you better believe I 'd scream like a little girl if I saw you do it .
Carl 's Jr. simply could n't sit still too long while KFC hopped into the sandwich game with their Double Down from days ago .
It looks like they 're trying to make some waves with this new " Footlong Cheeseburger " they 're testing out at one of my local Santa Ana , CA , locations .
The sandwich comes along with some chuckles , to say the least .
It sells for $ 4 ( the plain cheeseburger ) , and the deluxe is set at $ 4.50 ( comes with all the fixings , lettuce , tomatoes , onions ) .
The combo meals are set at $ 6.50 for the cheeseburger version and $ 7.00 for the deluxe footlong .
The 12 - inch burger is wrapped like a sandwich , and sticks out of most of the to - go bags offered up at the location , so it was definitely an interesting sight .
I 'm not sure how well the burger will fair , it 's basically just a few patties and ingredients mimicking a sub sandwich , which may end up not helping its overall appeal .
So it 's basically three cheeseburgers laid end to end on a sub bun .
I 'm not even gonna lie , that sounds fattening .
And delicious .
Where were you on this , Subway ?
Eat fresh my ass -- you eatin ' rotten !
Hit the jump for a couple recon shots of the actual burger .

Israel agreed on Thursday to ease its land blockade on the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip , hoping to quell growing international criticism following a deadly sea raid .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office released few details about the changes in its three - year - old blockade , and it was not clear whether any firm decisions had been made .
The only item singled out in its statement was a plan to allow in desperately needed construction materials for civilian projects , but only under international supervision .
Israel has barely allowed in materials like cement and steel , arguing that Hamas militants could use them to build weapons and fortifications .
That policy has prevented Gaza from rebuilding after Israel ’s fierce war in the territory last year .
There was no mention in the statement of any change in other damaging aspects of the blockade , like bans on exports or allowing in raw materials used in industrial production .
Israel ’s naval blockade will also remain in force .
The statement noted that Israel would “ continue existing security procedures to prevent the inflow of weapons and war materiel . ”
Netanyahu has repeatedly warned that if the naval closure is lifted , Hamas would turn Gaza into an “ Iranian port . ”
Israel has been scrambling to find ways to ease the blockade since a May 31 raid on a blockade - busting flotilla turned deadly .
The deaths of nine Turkish activists on board one of the ships drew international attention to the blockade and provoked much anger against Israel worldwide .
Israeli naval commandos said they were forced to open fire after they were attacked by a violent mob of activists on board the ship .
The activists say they acted in self - defense .
Israel , with Egypt ’s cooperation , imposed the blockade three years ago after the Hamas movement , which killed hundreds of Israelis in suicide attacks , violently wrested control of Gaza .
For the most part , only basic humanitarian goods have been allowed in .
But the blockade failed to achieve its aims of stanching the flow of weapons to Gaza or weakening Hamas .
A network of smuggling tunnels under the Egypt - Gaza border became a conduit for both weapons and commercial goods sold at black market prices .
Gazans sank deeper into poverty , turning their anger against Israel and not their Hamas rulers .
The partial lifting of the siege did not satisfy Hamas .
“ We want a real lifting of the siege , not window - dressing , ” said Hamas lawmaker Salah Bardawil .
In the West Bank , the rival pro-Western Palestinian government of President Mahmoud Abbas also rejected the Israeli decision .
Negotiator Saeb Erekat said the closure should be ended altogether .
“ The siege is collective punishment and it must be lifted . ”
Amid the heavy international criticism that followed the Israeli naval raid , Egypt opened its land border crossing with Gaza -- the main gateway for some residents to enter and exit the crowded territory .
But most Gazans remained confined to the territory because Egyptian officials say they have let in only about 10,000 people with special travel permits , such as students and people with foreign passports .
Scott Welch was like any executive in top - level management .
Big salary , very driven .
The thing is , Welch had an unusual obsession with tropical plants .
So much so that he ended up embezzling millions of dollars from Wachovia to feed his habit .
We 're talking about a fascination with flora and fauna , here .
In a new piece from the Charlotte Observer , courtesy of NY Mag , we learn how Welch managed to screw his employer out of $ 11.2 million so he could landscape his home with lavish plants :
NY Mag : Scott Welch loved to landscape .
Neighbors say the Welches had new palm trees delivered every year , and county records show there used to be a large lighthouse statue in their backyard .
Welch had [ local stonemason Delmar ]
Dove build stone walls , do irrigation work , and even add brick tiling to the doghouse .
As if brick tiling to a doghouse was n't enough , Welch apparently took a liking to Abraham Lincoln 's birthplace , building a ridicuously expensive log -cabin for his children to play in :
He also commissioned a $ 77,000 log - cabin playhouse for his children .
And he might not have stopped there !
He might have kept adding birdbaths , koi ponds , and maybe even bougainvillea and hibiscus bushes and assorted other tropical plants — despite the fact that , as indicated by the fact that his palm trees need to be replenished annually when they should have been fine given the proper care , according to North Carolina 's Gary 's Nursery , Welch 's passion was ironically and tragically impeded by a terrible brown thumb — were he not laid off in 2008 , at which point the company reviewed his expense forms and discovered he had been billing them for his hobby .
Welch is now facing up to 30 years in prison for his lavish shopping spree .
According to the Charlotte Observer article , he apparently had an obsession with landscaping and kept wanting to out - do himself each time he funnelled money from Wachovia to do more decorating .
Author 's Note :
This topic was suggested to me by Dom after he had a discussion with a Danish reporter about Frans Nielsen .
I took the Viking by the horns and wrote this article on the current state of Danish hockey .
In the South Park episode " Canada on Strike , " the people of Denmark are referred to as the " Canadians of Europe . "
With the new influx of hockey talent from this tiny Scandinavian country with a population smaller than that of the Boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn combined , it looks as if Denmark is really on its way to becoming the Canadians of Europe .
Continuing on my Scandinavian themed posts , in a way the Islanders are ground breaking here .
They were the first NHL team to employ a Danish skater .
Frans Nielsen was drafted in the 3rd round of 2002 while playing for Malmo of the Elitserien .
Little did we know back then that at the ripe old age of 26 , Frans would become the elder statesman of a new influx of talent from the Jutland .
Following Frans over first were Jannik Hansen of the Vancouver Canucks , Morten Madsen of the Wild and Peter Regin of the Ottawa Senators .
They were quickly followed by St. Louis 1st rounder Lars Eller , former Top 10 pick Mikkel Bødker of the Phoenix Coyotes , and Dallas defensemen Phillip Larsen , who made his NHL debut this season at 20 .
Lets take a closer look at the emergence of this somewhat unlikely burgeoning hockey powerhouse .
The Current State of Danish Hockey
Denmark is on the hockey upswing right now .
They 've been playing in the top division of the World Championships since 2003 .
2003 was the country 's first time playing in the top international division and peaked with a 10th place finish in 2007 .
2007 also saw Denmark 's highest IIHF ranking at 12 , a position they held until the end of this past World Championships .
Unfortunately the high finishes in the WC and IIHF ranking was n't enough to give them home ice advantage in the Olympic Qualifiers , which went to Norway , Germany and Latvia .
Denmark was drawn in the group against Norway , Kazakhstan and France .
Norway ( With all theirs top players except Ole - Kristian Tollefsen ) proceeded to defeat Denmark ( Without Nielsen , Regin , Hansen , Bodker and Morten Madsen ) , Kazakhstan and France , taking their place in Vancouver .
Danish hockey is rising though .
They have six legitimate NHLers right now with Frans Nielsen , Peter Regin , Mikkel Bodker , Lars Eller , Jannik Hansen and Phillip Larsen .
We here at Lighthouse Hockey know how good Nielsen is , and Regin is developing into a slightly taller version of Frans .
Hansen is a useful player for Vancouver .
Eller and Bodker both have the chance to be top end scorers in the NHL and have tons of potential .
The Stars liked Larsen enough to give him a 3 - year NHL deal and give him a baptism of fire towards the end of the season .
Expect him to be on the Stars ' blueline next season .
There are a couple of highly thought of prospects that have n't panned out as well though .
Former Wild pick Morten Madsen and former Blue Jackets prospect Kirill Starkov both failed at making an impact in their attempts at North American hockey .
While Madsen has seen success playing for MoDo in Sweden , Starkov 's star has fallen precipitously .
In two seasons he went from playing in the AHL , to the KHL , then the Elitserien and now will be playing back in Denmark next year .
Madsen still has a bright future , at 23 he can make a very productive career for himself in Sweden and playing for the National team .
In this past year 's World Championships , the national team also produced some impressive scalps with their victories over the USA and Finland .
In spite of arguably the two biggest hockey wins in the country 's history , their failure to advance past the quarterfinals and lack of an Olympics actually saw Denmark loose a spot in the IIHF rankings from 12 to 13 .
Germany , the team that was 13 going into the Olympics , rose all the way to 9 thanks to a purely home ice fueled run to the Semi-Finals of the WC .
The WC roster boasted four of the six NHLers ( Hansen was playing with the Canucks and Bodker with the Coyotes in the playoffs ) and had only four players on the roster over the age of 30 .
Denmark is continuing to develop hockey talent .
In the past three drafts , they have more first rounders than the Czech Republic , Norway , Slovakia , Belarus , Latvia , Germany and Switzerland , all countries that appeared in the Olympics ahead of Denmark .
There are also several prospect that are a year or two away from contributing to their teams in Oliver Lauridsen ( Philidelphia , oddly enough playing at St. Cloud State ) and draft - eligible prospects Jesper Jensen , Patrick Bjorkstrand and Patrick Hertzberg .
They have a legitimate chance to not only be at Sochi in 2014 but surprise some people if they make it there .
The Swedish Proving Ground
While most of the Danish players spend a good portion of their time in youth programs and developmental clubs in Denmark , the best got to cut their teeth in the Elitserien .
The first to go was Frans Nielsen , beginning with Malmo and then with Timra prior to signing with the Islanders in 2006 .
Nielsen credits his time in Sweden as the reason he is such a sound two - way player .
In an interview with Chris Botta for Islander 's Point Blank back in March he said the following :
They play a lot of trap hockey in the Swedish League , but either way I think it ’s the best defensive league in the world .
When I first got there , I did n’t know much about defense .
In Denmark , I had the puck a lot .
But Malmo put me on the fourth line and told me , ‘ Just focus on not letting the other team score . ’
The Swedes completely taught me how to be a responsible two - way forward .
That ’s where I also learned how to win faceoffs .
By the last season in Sweden , I was top - five in the league .
When I first got there , I could n’t beat anybody on a draw .
Likewise , Regin followed his buddy Franz to Timra in 2005 .
Regin served a three year apprenticeship with Timra prior to signing with Ottawa in 2008 .
For his first two seasons , Regin got the Nielsen treatment of " Just play on the fourth line an think about your D kid , " but in the 2007 - 2008 season he was given more offensive opportunities as the center on the 2nd line where he put up a decent line of 12 G/19 A/31 Pts in 55 games .
This made him Timra 's 3rd highest scorer behind Riku Hahl and Mika Pyorala .
Prior to coming to North America this past season , Lars Eller played two seasons for Frolunda in the Elitserien after going through the youth ranks there .
Phillip Larsen is also a product of Frolunda 's youth system and played in parts of four seasons ( He made his Frolunda debut at 16 ) in the Elitserien prior to signing with Dallas .
Currently there are only three Danes that will play in next season 's Elitserien : Madsen , Mads Bodker and Julien Jakobsen .
There are several Danish players in the wings playing in either the SuperElit ( The top U - 20 League ) and the J - 18 Elit .
Sweden will continue to be the place to go for the young Danish player to prove himself .
A couple of Danes have chosen to forgo the Swedish route and come and play in the CHL .
This has proven to have somewhat mixed results .
Jannik Hansen played for the Portland Winterhawks in 2005 - 2006 where he put up about a point per game .
He 's bounced between Vancouver and Manitoba for the past four seasons .
Morten Madsen lit up the Q for 100 points with Victriaville in 2006 - 2007 after leaving Frolunda in the Elitserien .
He was unable to translate that scoring success to the pro game and has since left the Wild organization for MoDo .
Mikkel Bodker joined Kitchner of the OHL from Frolunda as well and like Madsen has had a tough time translating his offensive ability to the North American pro game .
So far it looks like the Elitserien is the better route for Danes to go in order to be successful in the NHL .
The Herning Phenomenon and Familial Connections
The city of Herning is situated almost in the geographical center of Denmark .
It is a small city of just under 46,000 people .
It is also the home of Frans Nielsen , Peter Regin , Kasper Degn , Mads Kristiansen , Daniel Nielsen ( No relation to Frans that I know of ) , Stefan Lassen , and Frederik Andersen , all of whom were on the 2010 World Championship roster for Denmark .
Also born in Herning is former Danish National team player Simon Nielsen ( Frans ' brother ) and rising stars Patrick Bjorkstrand , Rasmus Nielsen , Andres Jensen and Patrick Hertzberg .
All these players went thought the youth program at Herning IK Blue Foxes .
Not since Moose Jaw , Saskatchewan , has a relatively unknown place turn into a hockey factory .
How did this small municipality produce so much good hockey talent ?
Two words : Frits Nielsen .
Frans ' Papa can be considered kind of the Godfather of Danish hockey .
After a seven year career playing for Herning , the elder Nielsen settled into coaching .
In 1984 , he took over as head coach of Herning IK , a post he would hold until the 1995 - 1996 season .
Since then he 's been intimately involved in player development at the club , seeing one of his sons develop into an NHL player and the other , Simon , represent his country as one of Denmark 's goalies at the 2007 and 2008 World Championships .
Frits ' two prized pupils , Frans and Regin , continue to give back to the community .
They are hosting the youth summer camp in Herning as they begin to groom the next generation of Danish hockey .
Another interesting aspect of Danish hockey is it tends to run in the family , as niche sports tend to do in all countries .
Not only do you have the Nielsen clan from Herning but Lars Eller 's father Olaf played defense for Denmark and is currently the head coach at a second division club .
Mikkel Bodker 's brother Mads plays for Rogle , Kenny Jonsson 's old club , who were just relegated from the Elitserien this past season .
Kirill Starkov 's father was a Russian professional player that moved to Denmark late in his career and stayed once he retired .
Jannik Hansen 's father Bent was a former Danish national Team player as was current national team goalie Frederik Andersen's .
The Future of Danish Hockey
" Denmark probably would have made the Olympics if they had all their guys , " said THN European correspondent Risto Pakarinen of the qualifying tourney , which took place during the NHL season .
" It 's a shame they did n't , they play really good hockey and have several good young players . "
That was in The Hockey News ' Olympic preview and it is probably true .
They had the unfortunate task of facing a Norway team with Mats Zuccarello Aasen , Patrick Thoresen , Mads Hansen , Jonas Holos , Anders Bastiensen and Tore Vikingstad in Oslo .
They have a better chance of qualifying for Sochi .
Their current ranking of 13th has them one ranking away , and a bad tournament from Lativa , Norway or Belarus from gaining a home ice qualifying round ( Olympic qualifying is the top 8 teams , the home nation and then the winners of three qualification stages for the field of 12 nations ) .
A good showing at next years World Championships could catapult them past the rapidly declining Latvia or Belarus for a spot in the 10 - 12 range .
A bigger concern for the Danes though is the continual poor showing at the World Junior Championships .
This past year in the second tier they lost in the final game of their group to Germany , who were subsequently promoted with Norway to the first tier replacing the relegated Latvia and Austria .
In the U - 18 Championships , they lost to Norway in the Second Tier .
The Norwegians were promoted along with Germany again to the first tier replacing Latvia ( Again ) and Belarus .
The two major stumbling blocks in Denmark 's way to becoming a hockey power are the NHL season and the neighbors to the north , Norway .
The NHL playoffs coincide directly with the IIHF World Championships .
Since Olympic qualification is based directly on performance in the WC , Denmark needs a good showing in each of the WC leading up to qualification .
They wo n't be able to do that if Frans Nielsen , Peter Regin , Lars Eller , Jannik Hansen and Mikkel Bodker are playing playoff hockey .
Unlike a Russia , USA , Canada or even a Czech Republic , right now Denmark just does n't have the depth of personnel to replace those names .
The recurring theme this past year for Denmark was loosing out to the Norwegians to get to the big show , whether it was the Olympics , WJC or the U - 18 tournaments .
Norway is also an emerging hockey power and has one thing the Danes do n't have as much of : money .
The North Sea oil reserves have given Norway a large war chest and the national team 's appearance at the Olympics have the formerly hockey - ambivalent nation starting to take notice .
The biggest publicity Norwegian hockey got was when captain Tommy Jakobsen carried the flag at the opening ceremonies .
The biggest advantage the Norwegians have over Denmark is most of their stars play in Europe .
While the Danes will have their top six players in North America next year , the Norwegians will have a maximum of three , Zuccarello Aasen , Holos and possibly Patrick Thoresen
So What Now ?
The talent gap between the nations in Europe is closing .
Danish hockey is on the rise , thanks to a still young generation of talented and skilled forwards lead by " Old Man " Frans Nielsen .
One can only hope that they will get the chance as a nation to show their skills on the biggest stage in four years at Sochi ( Hopefully not at the expense of Norway ) .
As of right now , Denmark has a very good chance to surpass traditional hockey powers like Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Latvia , Belarus and Kazakhstan as the core talent of these countries gets older .
At this past year 's WC , the Danish team 's average age was 26.25 years , but it was only 24.26 if you do n't include 42 year old Jesper Duus .
The Czechs average age was 27.52 , Slovakia 27.62 , Kazakhstan 28.44 and Belarus 27.09 .
Latvia bucked the trend with 25.01 , but the only reason they were n't in the relegation round is they were also in a group with Italy .
These countries are n't producing the high end young talent they once did since money to the hockey development programs have dried up .
Non-traditional hockey countries like Denmark , Switzerland and Norway are producing good young talent and have the potential to pass these countries in the not too distant future .
At the hearing yesterday , Mr. Breen said that on the afternoon of Sept. 10 , Mr. Elgindy contacted his broker at Salomon Smith Barney and asked him to sell $ 300,000 in stock in his children 's trust funds .
During the Sept. 10 conversation , Mr. Elgindy predicted that the Dow Jones industrial average , which at the time stood at about 9,600 , would soon crash to below 3,000 , Mr. Breen said .
Mr. Elgindy was unable to sell the stock before markets closed Sept. 10 , and it was instead sold Sept. 18 , the first day that markets reopened for trading after the attacks , Mr. Breen said .
The Salomon Smith Barney broker contacted the F.B.I. after the attacks to report the conversation , Mr. Breen said .
He did not identify the broker .
A spokesman for Salomon Smith Barney confirmed that Mr. Elgindy was a client but said that Salomon did not comment on matters relating to its clients .
Mr. Elgindy also transferred more than $ 700,000 to Lebanon in the months after the attacks , Mr. Breen said .
When F.B.I. agents raided Mr. Elgindy 's home outside San Diego on Wednesday , Mr. Breen said , they found $ 43,000 in cash , as well as a loose diamond and faxes indicating that Mr. Elgindy had been tipped about the raid and had given his wife a power of attorney to liquidate his assets .
Ms. Knight , Mr. Elgindy 's lawyer , denied that Mr. Elgindy had any prior knowledge of the attacks .
Mr. Elgindy 's wife is from Louisiana , Ms. Knight said , adding that his mother was a pediatrician and his father a professor .
'' Tony is n't political at all , '' she said .
'' He 's a capitalist .
He 's not going to move to a third world country . ''
Senior law enforcement officials said yesterday that investigators had no hard evidence that Mr. Elgindy had advance information about the Sept. 11 attacks .
So far , they have not found anyone who had prior knowledge of the attacks , they said .
But they said the investigation into why Mr. Elgindy tried to sell the shares in his children 's trust accounts before Sept. 11 had raised questions that had not been fully answered .
Mr. Elgindy has been an active supporter of Muslim causes .
In 1999 , he arranged to bring 30 Muslim refugees from Kosovo to the United States , according to The Daily Herald of Chicago .
Mr. Elgindy said the violence in Kosovo , Serbia 's southern province , appalled him , comparing it to the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado .
'' Take Columbine , have it occur five times a day for a year , and that 's Kosovo , '' Mr. Elgindy told The Daily Herald .
Half a million Israelis live on stolen West Bank land
By Danny Richardson
14 July 2010
The civil rights organisation B’Tselem states that more than half a million Israeli settlers are living on land situated within the West Bank .
A report finds there are an estimated 300,000 people living in 121 official settlements , plus 100,000 in smaller unofficial “ outposts ” .
The remainder in the 12 Jerusalem neighbourhoods annexed to the Jerusalem Municipality .
This represents a total control of 42.8 percent of West Bank land , equalling 2,399,824 dunam , ( 1 dunam = 1000 square meters )
Outposts are settlements built without government approval , but with the support of various government ministries , the army , and the Civil Administration .
The annexed Jerusalem neighbourhoods are part of a scheme meant to separate Jerusalem from the West Bank .
By Hook and by Crook : Israeli Settlement Policy in the West Bank , is an update to the B’Tselem 2002 report , Land Grab : Israel ’s Settlement Policy in the West Bank .
It was compiled using official state documents , cross-checked data from the Civil Administration , the settlements jurisdictional area and aerial photos taken in 2009 .
In spite of the obstacles placed in its way , the report sets out in detail the historical expansion of settlements , official and unofficial , into the West Bank .
It documents the methods used by successive Israeli governments since 1967 to illegally take control of land in the West Bank , the majority of which was known to be owned privately by Palestinians who were prevented from claiming back their land .
It argues that this land grab is “ an instrumental , cynical , and even criminal approach to international law , local legislation , Israeli military orders and Israeli law ” .
The construction of settlements is a state run operation .
From the misappropriation of the land , turning a blind eye to the lack of building regulations , the building of roads , power and water treatment plants and security fences , through to enticing Israeli citizens to populate the settlements , various offices of state ensure the construction goes ahead unimpeded .
By classifying settlements as National Priority " A " , the future settlers are given enormous non means - tested enticements to relocate .
Cash incentives allow settlers to purchase quality inexpensive apartments that become linked to an automatic subsidised mortgage .
Wide ranging benefits in education and community benefits are also on offer .
Teachers receive higher salaries .
Unemployment is lower than in Israel proper .
The gross monthly income in settler households was 10 percent higher in 2006 .
Grants , subsidies and tax breaks for industry and agriculture also makes living and operating a business in a settlement a financially better prospect .
The communities and local authorities receive better and larger grants .
Establishing day care centres , libraries and community centres all fare better than in Israel .
The full costs of meeting the incentives cannot be ascertained , virtually impossible , the report says , due to government ministries obscuring details in documentation concerning settlement projects within their budgets .
The report , written and researched by Eyal Hareuveni , displays the growth in the official settlements from the solitary Kfar Etzion settlement established in 1967 , to the 121 with a population of 301,202 by the end of 2009 .
An article in Haaretz in February 2010 noted that within the 2009 figures , 66 percent of settlements showed a higher increase in population than in Israel itself .
These figures are for officially recognised settlements only .
To give an indication of the scale of this expansion , Hareuveni uses the growth between 2001 and 2009 in the area of the three largest West Bank settlements .
Modi ’in Illit grew by78 percent , Betar Illit by 55 percent and Ma’ale Adumim by 34 percent .
Many of the settlements borders exceed the original jurisdictional orders , so the actual areas taken by the settlements will be even greater .
The 200 strategically - placed settlements that connect to each other and Israel by an elaborate system of road works have created territorial islands that come under Israeli control .
This makes it impossible for Palestinians to move about freely .
The construction of the separation barrier wall has been deliberately placed outside the Green Line .
It not only breaks up communities , but — using the abuse of official military orders in an occupied territory — allows Israel to snatch fertile land belonging to Palestinians .
The establishment of “ illegal outposts ” , which began after the 1967 War , escalated in 1996 , following a government decision that new settlements would require the approval of the entire government .
Outposts are built without building plans or any official jurisdictional borders , but still benefit from state help .
B’Tselem ’s report estimates the outposts control 16,000 dunam , 7,000 of which is plundered private Palestinian land .
All the West Bank land used for settlements , authorised or not , was obtained by various methods of double dealing using a dubious legal framework to achieve the political desires of the Israeli state .
The report severely criticises the Israeli legal establishment for not only allowing the illegal constructions to go ahead , but placing it within the Israeli legal framework .
In an Internet introduction to “ Land Grab ” ( 2002 ) , B’Tselem takes issue with the legal discrimination practiced in the occupied West Bank .
It notes , “ The Israeli administration has applied most aspects of Israeli law to the settlers and the settlements , thus effectively annexing them to the State of Israel .
This has taken place although in formal terms the West Bank is not part of the State of Israel , and the law in effect there is Jordanian law and military legislation .
This annexation has resulted in a regime of legalized separation and discrimination .
This regime is based on the existence of two separate legal systems in the same territory , with the rights of individuals being determined by their nationality . ”
The 2010 report goes further , claiming the interpretation that the State Attorney 's Office gave to the concept “ state land ” in the Ottoman Land Law contradicted explicit statutory provisions and judgments of the British Mandatory Supreme Court .
Behind a “ legal cloak ” , using a combination of methods — claiming land for “ military needs ” , declaring or registering land as “ state land ” , and expropriating land for “ public needs ” — the Israeli state has gained approximately half of the West Bank .
In the cases of the “ outposts ” , the Israeli judiciary have done nothing to uphold the law and return land seized directly by settlers to their legal owners .
A system of banditry is carried out without punishment .
Yet the law is used ruthlessly to remove Palestinians from their property or to demolish Palestinian homes and structures that do not have the correct permits attached to their construction .
The use of military requisition orders began after the 1967 occupation and continued unabated for a decade : “ This contention was made because international humanitarian law permits the occupying country to appropriate property under private ownership for military purposes , but on a temporary basis only .
Appropriation of this kind does not grant property rights , and the occupying country is not permitted to sell the assets it appropriated .
Fifty - six settlements , some of which began as Nahal ( youth cadre ) army bases that were subsequently declared civilian sites , were built on the appropriated land . ”
After a court case over the Elon Moreh settlement in 1979 questioning this practice , it was meant to be curtailed .
But no land appropriated by military order has been returned to its Palestinian owners , and a further 11 settlements were established on military acquired land .
Requisitioning land and naming it “ state owned land ” became the main practice after Elon Moreh .
The process to rename Palestinian land as state land began by applying a very narrow interpretation of Ottoman Law .
By claiming the Israel Defence Force Commander to be the sovereign in the territories , and contradicting judgments made by the British Mandate Supreme Court concerning cultivation and ownership of the land , the Israeli Civil Administration took possession of more than 16 percent of the West Bank .
By freezing the registration of West Bank property at the Land Registration Office in 1968 , any land could be claimed as state land .
In 1984 the military commander took on more powers to “ retroactively ” broaden the definition of government property .
Land requisitioned as military land was later declared state land and then designated for settlement use or kept in reserve for new settlements .
By fencing off any farmland surrounding the settlements borders , Palestinians were prevented from working it .
The land then became classed as “ uncultivated ” , passing over to settlers for their use .
The report leaves the reader in no doubt concerning past and present US administrations ’ acquiescence to Israel ’s settlement activity , by disregarding several agreements specifying a halt to building and the removal of the outposts .
President Barak Obama ’s recent praise of Netanyahu as a man of peace , a man notorious for his support for expanding the settlements , highlights the disregard his administration has for the rights of Palestinians .
Since the US - sponsored Oslo “ Peace process ” began in 1993 , the settler population in the West Bank , not counting East Jerusalem , has almost trebled .

With Defense Department officials forever trying to convince Americans that the military ’s role in Iraq will be coming to an end “ on schedule ” at the end of 2011 , the US State Department is hastily assembling its own army of contractors to continue the war past the end of the Status of Forces Agreement deadline .
State Department officials were already floating the idea of creating a “ combat force ” of their own for the purposes of continuing the war past 2011 , but now they are talking of fielding their own army as part of the “ transition . ”
Some seven years after the initial invasion , US dominance of Iraqi affairs remains enormous , and the State Department plans to continue this dominance seem predicated on keeping an army on the ground .
And if that army is n’t the US Army , one will simply be created out of wholecloth .
Incoming US Ambassador to Iraq Jim Jeffrey has suggested that America ’s “ diplomatic presence ” across Iraq will need to be maintained for at least another 3 - 5 years after the US troops leave in 2011 .
In effect this plan would keep the war going past the “ firm ” 2011 deadline .
Beyond combat operations , the State Department also intends to take over police training operations in Iraq .
The legality of having the State Department conducting what are in effect military operations is unclear , but such objections do not appear to have been seriously considered by the administration .

At the sprawling red shirt encampment in central bank , Buddhist monks clad in their distinctive saffron robes mingle with men wearing helmets walking around with sharpened bamboo sticks .
Just about every night , rumours sweep the the sprawling encampment of tents , sounds trucks and makeshift stalls that a long anticipated crackdown is imminent .
The men stare at the three - metre barricades made of tyres , bamboo poles and rubble that surround much of the encampment , about the size of a large city park , waiting to pelt soldiers armed with assault rifles with pellets from their sling shots and thrusts of their bamboo spears .
The monks are there for moral support , and to receive “ merit ” from the red shirts , who have occupied some of the most expensive real estate in Thailand for the past seven weeks in their campaign for early elections .
“ Making merit ” involves giving an offering — food , some spare change to a monk — perhaps in the hope of a more accommodating afterlife , should death suddenly intervene .
As it well could on the barricades when you ’re fending off automatic weapons fire with a bamboo stick .
But the presence of Buddhist monks at the rallies — including some carrying sharpened sticks — is unsettling to many in Thailand , where monks are supposed to be politically neutral .
They are not even supposed to vote .
Amnart Buasiri , director of the Secretariat of the Sangha Supreme Council , the clergy ’s governing body called on police to arrest monks for taking part in the red shirt rallies , which are illegal under emergency decrees imposed after the protests turned violent three weeks ago .
It should come as no surprise that monks are joining the red shirt movement ( though it ’s difficult to check their authenticity ) .
They often come from the same social strata as the protesters — the rural poor and urban working class .
Their hero , former premier Thaksin Shinawatra , ousted in a 2006 coup and now living abroad to avoid jail on a corruption conviction , is a devout Buddhist aligned with the powerful Dhammakaya movement .
During the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 , this monastic community famously collected gold jewelry to enable Thailand to pay off its debts to the IMF .
Dhammakaya was also major force in the formation of the Thaksin ’s populist Thai Rak Thai party , which has banned .
The Thai political divide that broadly pits this underclass against what they call an establishment elite is beginning to be reflected in religion .
Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva ’s government relies for support on the Muslim - dominated provinces of southern Thailand along with an establishment that includes Buddhist leaders appointed by the crown .
On Friday , the security agency in charge of dealing with the political crisis ( CRES ) said a rocket - propelled grenade attack last month near the Defence Ministry actually targeted the Temple of the Emerald Buddha , part of the Grand Palace complex in Bangkok , which historically has functioned as a kind of personal chapel for the royal family .
The government has been stepping up accusations recently that the red shirt movement has republican leanings and some of its leaders are part of a network to overthrow the monarchy in their drive to upend the establishment .
The red shirts deny they are against the monarchy .
Thai monks have been less politically active than in other Asian nations where Buddhism is strong –in neighbouring Myanmar , for instance , monks have often been at the forefront of protests against the junta there .
That could be changing .
Some of the dozen or so monks staying in the red shirt encampment say they are there to maintain an atmosphere of nonviolence and uphold Buddhist principles .
If the army moves in they say they will stand in front of the red shirts and plead for no bloodshed .

The French military base in Abu Dhabi has been hailed as a historic first in a region of strategic importance .
But the question of whether Sharia laws should apply on it has left French and Emirati officials bogged down in frantic negotiations .

Dubbed the “ Peace Camp , ” the French military base is situated in Abu Dhabi , one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE ( United Arab Emirates ) .
In terms of geopolitical real estate , the French military could not have secured a more strategic site : the base lies on the banks of the Strait of Hormuz , a narrow waterway between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman , through which 40 percent of the region ’s oil shipments pass .
More critically , across the narrow waterway lies Iran , a country that has expressed its strong disapproval over the French military presence in its backyard .
But a year after its much celebrated inauguration , a problem seems to have arisen between the French military officials and their new hosts , one that is still being frantically resolved .
On Wednesday , the leading French daily , Le Monde , reported that intense negotiations between French and Abu Dhabi officials were underway to ensure that Abu Dhabi laws , essentially Islamic or Sharia laws , do not apply to French military personnel and their families stationed on the base .
In a report titled “ Abu Dhabi base : France confronts the application of Sharia law , ” the paper noted that Sharia provides for the death penalty , which is banned in France and other EU countries .
More generally , the report noted , Sharia law comprises a range of penalties “ inconsistent with ( French ) republican principles ” .
When contacted by FRANCE 24 , French Defense Ministry spokesman Laurent Teisseire downplayed the sensitivities of the negotiations .
He noted that France and Abu Dhabi currently have a defense agreement which was signed in 1995 .

According to Teisseire , given the high level of defense cooperation and deals between the two countries , the 15 - year - old agreement , he said , needed an update .
He also expressed confidence that the two countries would arrive at a negotiated deal .
France and the UAE , the world ’s third - largest oil exporter , have extensive mutual defense and business interests .
The UAE in recent times has been diversifying its military suppliers and the Gulf nation also plans to build a number of nuclear reactors to meet its growing energy diversification needs .
French defense groups , as well as Areva , the French nuclear reactor maker , are vying for key UAE contracts .
First French base in the Mideast
With their negotiations over the Abu Dhabi military base camp , French military officials , in many ways , are entering unchartered waters .
The base , located at three sites on the outskirts of the Abu Dhabi city of Port Zayed , is the first French permanent military base to be opened in 50 years .
It is also France ’s first military base in the Middle East .
All of France ’s other overseas military bases are in former French colonies in Africa .
When it comes to France ’s business and defense interests in its former African colonies , the rules – or the lack thereof – have been characterized by what the French call Françafrique , a term used to refer to the sort of opaque , backroom network of personal , business and political links that have traditionally marked French - African policies .
Half - a- century ago , the application of French law on its African bases was a given .
In the case of the US , which has extensive bases in the area referred to as “ Centcom ” ( Central Command ) by the Pentagon , US Defense officials sign a Status of Forces Agreement , called SOFA , with host governments .
SOFA stipulates that US military personnel are subject to US military justice , according to John Pike , director of globalsecurity.org , a US - based defense and intelligence site .
SOFA came under heavy criticism following the 1995 kidnapping and rape of a Japanese girl by three US military officials .
But US military orders on various bases , according to Pike , also change with local customs and cultures .
During the 1990 Gulf War , for example , female US military officials could not leave the Prince Sultan base in Al Kharj , Saudi Arabia , without an abaya , or all - enveloping female garb .
Alcohol is prohibited on many US bases in the Mideast and some bases have strict night curfews .
It remains to be seen if the French , who pride themselves on their uncompromising adherence to the French way of life , can strike the requisite compromises in their new base in the Mideast and whether the negotiated compromise will be conducted transparently , indicating a clear break from the old French way of doing defense business .

Today , Tuesday June 15 , is a day the NDP ” ˜s Jack Layton will face a leadership test .
He is poised to make a decision to punish one of his MPs and it could stain his leadership for a long time to come .
The party is in a state of near hysteria over what should have been a minor flap .
But when the question of Israel and the Palestinians is involved , nothing is simple .
The pro-Israel lobby and its friends are masters of taking advantage of any situation to promote their cause and vilify Israel ’s critics .
And it does n’t matter if the victim is an icon of progressive politics .
In this case Vancouver East MP Libby Davies got bushwacked by a pro-Israel activist posing as a neutral – if not pro-Palestinian – blogger .
After a rally for the Palestinians criticizing Israel ’s deadly assault on the aid flotilla , a man approached Libby asking for an interview .
As she always does , because she never hides her views , she complied .
He immediately set her up with what he called a “ background question . ”
He asked when the occupation began , 1948 or 1967 .
Libby hesitated then said 1948 .
She made the point that the date was not important – that whatever the date the occupation was the longest in the world – and far too long .
The next day the interview appeared on YouTube .
But in 24 hours it had gone nowhere – just 28 views .
Then the most vociferous supporter of Israel in the NDP caucus , Thomas Mulcair , got wind of it and it escalated out of control .
He went on a relentless campaign to punish Libby .
The spin he helped create was that if Libby believed the occupation began in 1948 then she , ipso facto , believes that Israel has no right to exist .
Libby has always gone to great lengths to make it clear that she supports Israel ’s right to exist and the two - state solution endorsed by the NDP .
But suddenly Jack Layton was in full - panic mode .
He apologized to the Israeli ambassador .
He hung Libby out to dry .
He forced her to issue a public apology .
Apology ?
For what ?
Some have criticized Libby ’s statement as evidence that she does not know the history of the occupation which most mainstream commentators date from 1967 – when Israel militarily occupied the West bank , Gaza and the Golan Heights .
But Libby ’s problem was not that she did n’t know enough .
She knew too much .
It is part of the unquestioned history of Israel that during the time leading up to its formal establishment by UN resolution 181 there was a massive , forced expulsion of 750,000 Palestinian Arabs from the land designated for the Jewish state .
The resolution explicitly banned any such expulsion .
The Arab population of that land had equal rights to it .
So when did the occupation begin ?
Certainly the Arab families who were forced from their homes , farms and villages by Israeli terrorist groups like the Irgun believe their land was occupied .
They still do .
That is the basis for their demand of the Right of Return .
In any case Libby ’s point in the interview was the correct one : whenever you date the occupation one thing is clear .
It is a grotesque violation of international law , human rights and numerous UN resolutions which Israel , with the carte blanche support of the US and Canada , contemptuously ignores .
Here ’s where the question of leadership comes in .
Jack Layton has said virtually nothing about the hideous blockade of Gaza – what commentators call an outdoor prison .
Why ?
Because he is does not , apparently , have the political courage to take an independent stand on Canadian foreign policy .
He said virtually nothing when eleven aid activists were murdered ( some of them executed at close range or shot in the back ) by Israeli commandos .
But suddenly he is fully engaged in the issue because one of his most trusted and ethical MPs got suckered into making a controversial statement .
Mr. Layton needs to rethink which is more important – the vicious blockade of Gaza , and the collective punishment of 1.5 million people .
Or a careless remark by an MP admired across the country for her courage and openness .
The irony is that Libby is being punished for doing exactly what Jack Layton should be doing : defending the human rights of a people suffering under the oppression of an Apartheid regime .
No one said leadership is easy .
Jack Layton should back off , tell Thomas Mulcair to quit exposing the party to public ridicule , and maybe consider taking a stand , with Libby , on behalf of the Palestinians of Gaza .
He might be pleasantly surprised at the response of Canadians .

HELLO RUSSIA : New Zealand has become the first country to start negotiating a free trade deal with Russia .
New Zealand has scored a trade coup by becoming the first country to start negotiating a free trade deal with Russia .
While the Russian market is currently small for New Zealand – around $ 200 million a year – the potential is seen as huge by our trade negotiators .
However , they warn it could be two or more years before the talks yield a result .
Trade Negotiations Minister Tim Groser spearheaded the effort to put New Zealand at the top of Russia 's list for a free trade agreement .
Speaking from Moscow last night , he said while the decision to launch talks was a breakthrough , they would not be easy .
The talks will also include discussions around extending free trade to Belarus and Kazakhstan .
A free trade deal would be a first for Russia , which is not yet a member of the World Trade Organisation .
It is seen as a potentially lucrative market – the world 's fifth - largest food importer and among the world 's largest importers of meat and dairy products .
The outgoing tourism market is growing – around 11 million Russians holiday in other countries each year , but less than 1 per cent of them come to New Zealand .
The education sector also has potential – tens of thousands of Russian students study overseas each year , but only about 1000 of them come here .
Most of what New Zealand exports to Russia is agricultural produce and New Zealand goods currently face stiff trade barriers .
But Mr Groser said there had also been surprising inroads by " clever New Zealanders " , including fashion designer Karen Walker , who has three stores in Moscow , along with Pumpkin Patch and Icebreaker .
After talks in Moscow yesterday , Russia agreed to proceed to a formal trade agreement with New Zealand , subject to an initial discussion .
Online auction giant eBay just can’t seem to catch a break : XPRT Venture has filed a lawsuit in Delaware seeking a whopping $ 3.8 billion in damages , claiming the company stole trade secrets from six XPRT patents and integrated them into its own payment systems .
The suit targets PayPal , Mill Me Later , StubHub , and Shopping.com , along with parent company eBay .
The suit dates all the way back to September 2001 , when the inventors of the patents ( George Likourezos and Michael A. Scaturro ) shared the patent - pending information with eBay under assurances of confidentiality .
The suit alleges eBay then broke that agreement and used techniques covered in the patents in its own online payment systems .
Instead , eBay went ahead and applied for its own patents without acknowledging XPRT ’s prior art .
“ XPRT claims that eBay ’s upper management knew or should have known , that the unauthorized use of Inventors ’ confidential and proprietary material ran the risk of patent infringement if XPRT ’s patent applications issued as patents , ” said attorneys Kelley Drye & Warren — who are representing XPRT — in a statement .
The suit contains nine counts : infringement claims on six XPRT patents , along with claims of conversion , misappropriation of trade secrets , and unjust enrichment .
The lawsuit lands at a particularly awkward time for Meg Whitman , who was eBay ’s CEO at the time of the alleged infringement .
Whitman is currently mounting a campaign for governor of California .

A monitoring well located on the ocean side of the Pilgrim Nuclear Station in Plymouth has registered elevated levels of the radioactive isotope tritium .
The tritium detected was still well below the Environmental Protection Agency ’s maximum allowable level in drinking water and does not pose a risk to health or safety , said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
David Tarantino , Pilgrim spokesman , said that a team of environmental engineers , chemists , maintenance , and operations specialists , and others are now trying to pinpoint the source of the tritium .
“ It ’s in an area where there ’s lots of underground systems that carry radioactive water , but we ca n’t even say for certain that it ’s a leaking system yet , ’’ he said .
Another source of tritium contamination occurs during washout , he said , when tritium leaves the plant in water vapor and returns to the ground in rain .
Pilgrim has 12 monitoring wells as part of a ground water protection initiative that the nuclear industry started after several high - profile cases of tritium leakage at the Indian Point nuclear plant in New York and the Braidwood nuclear power plant in Illinois .
Earlier this year , a leak was discovered at Vermont Yankee in Vernon , Vt .
Neil Sheehan , a spokesman for the NRC , said that the problem at Vermont Yankee was more significant than the one at Pilgrim appears to be .
“ These are fairly low levels here , ’’ Sheehan said .
“ The concern for us is whenever they see evidence for tritium above these low threshold limits , they immediately begin a process of trying to identify the source . ’’
Tarantino said that water samples were also being provided to the state Department of Public Health and that careful monitoring was ongoing of the wells onsite , as well as in offsite places , such as the ocean , to ensure that contaminated water is not leaving the property .
Pilgrim is seeking a 20 - year license renewal .
Sheehan said it was possible , but not likely , that the discovery of elevated tritium levels would play a role in whether the plant receives approval .
Ralph Andersen — senior director of radiation , safety , and environmental protection at the Nuclear Energy Institute , a trade organization for the nuclear industry — said that the detection of the tritium was evidence the system was working .

Down with jet lag
The active agent metyrapone influences corticosterone synthesis and enables faster adaptation to altered circadian rhythms
Journeys across several time zones make our internal body clocks go haywire .
We feel exhausted and tense , and our sleep pattern is out of synch .
As scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry have now succeeded in demonstrating for mice , the clocks associated with individual organs in the body adapt to the new time at different speeds .
As a result , the body ’s physiological processes are no longer coordinated .
The adrenal gland plays a key role in this process .
When the researchers switched off the adrenal clock or manipulated the synthesis of corticosterone by the adrenal gland with the help of metyrapone , the rodents adapted more quickly to the altered circadian rhythm .
These insights could pave the way for a new approach to the hormonal treatment of the effects of jet lag and shift work .

Be they professional footballers on their way to the World Cup in South Africa or ordinary holidaymakers : people who cross several time zones by jet are prone to certain symptoms for a few days after the flight .
During the day , they are crippled with exhaustion ; at night they lie awake tossing and turning , unable to sleep , and many of the body ’s functions are activated at the wrong time .
What we have here is a clear case of jet lag .
Our " internal body clock " , which still beats to our old rhythm of day and night , must adapt to the new external time .
The process works , however : after a few days , we feel in synch with the outside world again .
The problems that arise with jet lag are a clear example of how external influences can disrupt our internal body clock .
An entire network of molecular clocks found in the different organs coordinate the body ’s various physiological processes ranging from the heart beat , temperature , sleep requirement and hormone balance to behaviour .
All of these clocks are controlled by the master pacemaker of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei ( SCN ) , which synchronises all of the body ’s " peripheral " clocks with the outside world .
At molecular level , all of the clocks are based on a handful of " clock " genes and proteins that regulate each other interactively and thus generate a molecular time signal in the form of a circadian rhythm - a term which originates from the Latin for approximately ( circa ) and day ( dies ) .
Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry have for the first time systematically studied how individual " clock " genes and the internal clocks of the different organs synchronise with the new external time in the case of jet lag .
The researchers were surprised by their findings .
" The internal clocks and the ‘ clock ’ genes adapt to the altered external influences at varying speeds , " says Gregor Eichele , Director of the Institute ’s Genes and Behaviour Department .
" When an organism suffers from jet lag , it would appear that the entire clock mechanism fails to tick at the right rhythm .
As a result , numerous physiological processes are no longer coordinated . "
Adrenal clock stabilises the status quo
As the Göttingen - based researchers discovered , the adrenal clock plays a key role in the body ’s adaptation to a new circadian rhythm .
When the scientists switched off the adrenal clock in mice , the rodents adapted their behaviour more quickly to the new time and made a more rapid return to their laps on the wheel in synch with the new external time .
Therefore , a functioning adrenal clock keeps the organism in a temporally stable state and halts the excessively rapid adaptation of the central clock in the SCN .
Physiologically , this makes complete sense .
Sporadic light changes - a dark stormy sky or dark cinema - do not disrupt the entire clock mechanism .
In the case of jet lag , however , this is precisely what causes the problem .
It is not necessary , however , to switch off the entire adrenal clock to enable the mice to better recover from jet lag .
The experiments carried out by the researchers give reason to hope that a less drastic solution may be possible .
The adrenal gland produces a series of important hormones , including adrenaline , noradrenaline and corticosterone ( cortisol in humans ) .
Completely switching off the adrenal clock would not , therefore , be advisable .
" The time - dependent release of corticosterone was crucial in enabling our rodents to adapt more quickly to the new time , " explains Eichele .
When the scientists administered the active agent metyrapone to the mice , their corticosterone rhythm changed as did their sleeping / waking rhythm .
" If the mice were given metyrapone at the right time , they adapted faster to the disturbed circadian rhythm .
While the ‘ sleep hormone ’ melatonin , which is commonly used to treat jet lag , mainly acts by generating tiredness and is therefore more suitable for use when flying east than west , with metyrapone , the mice ’s internal clock can be turned both forwards and back , " explains junior scientist Silke Kießling .
New treatment approaches
The insights of the Göttingen scientists could produce an entirely new approach to the treatment of jet lag in the future .
Metyrapone is already approved as a medication for the treatment of the overproduction of glucocorticoids and mineralcorticoids .
However , it remains to be demonstrated in " field trials " and tests in the sleep laboratory whether the administration of metyrapone is suitable for the treatment of jet lag , and whether it has any side effects in humans .
" Our results from the mouse model are not necessarily transferable to humans , " stresses Henrik Oster , who heads the research group " Circadian Rhythms " .
" With our mouse mutants , we have an excellent system on which we can base our search for chronobiologically effective substances .
However , it remains to be confirmed by clinical studies whether these are as effective in humans as they are in nocturnal animals like mice . "
The carbon footprint of bananas :
80g CO2e each
480g CO2e per kilo
Bananas are a great food for anyone who cares about their carbon footprint .
For just 80g of CO2e you get a whole lot of nutrition : 140 calories as well as stacks of vitamin C , vitamin B6 , potassium and dietary fibre .
All in all , a fantastic component of a low - carbon diet .
Bananas are good for just about everyone – athletes , tennis pros , people with high blood pressure , everyday cycle commuters in search of an energy top - up , or anyone wishing to chalk up their recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables per day .
There are three main reasons that bananas have such small carbon footprints compared with the nourishment they provide :
• They are grown in natural sunlight , which means that no energy - intensive hot - housing is required .
• They keep well , so although they are often grown thousands of miles from the end consumer , they are transported by boats , which per kilo of freight transported emit only 1 % as much CO2 as planes do .
• There is hardly any packaging , if any , because they provide their own .
( You might sometimes see a bunch in a light plastic bag or wrapper , but this probably pays for itself carbon - wise by reducing the chance of customers ruining the fruit when they try to split a bunch . )
None of which is to say that bananas are too good to be true .
Of the hundreds of banana varieties in existence , almost all the ones we get to eat are of the ' Cavendish ' variety .
The adoption of this monoculture in the pursuit of maximum , cheapest yields has been criticised for degrading land and requiring liberal use of pesticides and fungicides – sometimes at the expense of plantation workers .
Furthermore , although land is dramatically better used for bananas than , say , beef in terms of nutrition per hectare , there are still parts of the world in which forests are being cleared for banana plantations .
That said , Fairtrade or organic bananas are widely available .
Choose those and you are likely to be buying a food that is about as green as it gets – as long as you do n't let them rot in your fruit bowl , that is .
If you find yourself with bananas on the turn , they are great in cakes and smoothies .

Arizona , How About a Real Solution ?
Arizona ’s new immigration law is stirring up a lot of controversy , though almost none of it , in truth , focuses on anything of ultimate relevance .
Here are the basics , coming from CNN after Governor Jan Brewer – using her magical , mystical political powers – made the new rules “ law ” with the whisk of her pen ( the politicians ’ and bureaucrats ’ version of a wand ) :
“ The bill requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect that they ’re in the United States illegally .
It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them .
“ The Republican governor also issued an executive order that requires additional training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling or discrimination .
“ ’ This training will include what does and does not constitute reasonable suspicion that a person is not legally present in the United States , ’ Brewer said after signing the bill .
“ ’ Racial profiling is illegal .
It is illegal in America , and it ’s certainly illegal in Arizona , ’ Brewer said . ”
Without even going any further , we can point out several huge discrepencies and falsehoods in this line of thought .
Let alone that it is utterly repugnant that any human being should be “ required ” of what is essentially a band of armed marauding and stealing thugs ( government ) that they carry papers or identification of any kind whatsoever , but does anyone really believe that those carrying out the government ’s orders along the “ border ” with Mexico are not going to more heavily scrutinize bronze - skinned , black - haired people instead of whites , negroes , orientals , or those of other outward ethnicity ?
If so , I ’d like to sell you some green cheese straight from the moon .
And just what constitutes being “ in the United States ? ”
All that the “ United States ” is comprised of is an arbitrary geographical region over which a variety of governments arrogantly proclaim jurisdiction , under the ridiculously lame excuse that someone ’s “ right to vote ” makes such an arrangement legitimate .
No one , under any guise whatsoever , can claim control over another ’s life , liberty , or property with any degree of righteousness .
But witness the governor ’s oh - so sanctimonious claims as to the conduct she promises from Arizona police :
“ Brewer ’s executive order was in response to critics who argue that the new law will lead to racial profiling , saying that most police officers do n’t have enough training to look past race while investigating a person ’s legal status .
“ ’As committed as I am to protecting our state from crime associated with illegal immigration , I am equally committed to holding law enforcement accountable should this stature ever be misused to violate an individual ’s rights , ’ Brewer said .
“ She added that the law would probably be challenged in courts and that there are those outside Arizona who have an interest in seeing the state fail with the new measure .
“ ’We can not give them that chance .
We must use this new tool wisely and fight for our safety with the honor Arizona deserves . ’ ”
Wow .
Delusion city .
News for the Governor : Governments automatically and inherently violate individual rights , and that most certainly includes the police .
And do you really view groups of people who come from a different government ’s conquered realm who may speak a different language than you as a threat ?
You seem to , since you openly state that you view this new “ law ” as a “ fight for our safety . ”
Even many of the opponents of the Arizona government ’s new policy are n’t thinking straight , however .
Here ’s Obama and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson both chiming in :
“ ’ Our failure to act responsible at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others .
That includes , for example , the recent efforts in Arizona , which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans , as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe , ’ the president said at a naturalization ceremony for 24 members of the military .
“ Brewer ’s counterpart in neighboring New Mexico , Gov. Bill Richardson , called the new law ‘ a terrible piece of legislation . ’
“ ’ It ’s against the democratic ideals of this country , ” he told CNN ’s “ Situation Room . ”
‘ It ’s a step backwards .
It ’s impractical . ”
More disconnection from reality that amounts to mere weasel words on both counts :
My idea of “ basic notions of fairness , ” Obama , is to just be left the hell alone , period .
And the “ trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe , ” is a cruel lie , and an illusion .
Have n’t the government courts in all 50 “ states ” plus the federal courts already ruled unambiguously and unanimously that the police and government in general are not there and do not exist to protect anyone .
They exist so that con-men like you get to stay in power .
As for Richardson , your “ democratic ideals ” are nothing more nor less than a shotgun wedding – an offer no one is allowed to refuse – even if they choose , like myself , to not vote and be a part of your criminal cabal .
And “ country ? ”
What “ country ? ”
That ’s a notion , as I demonstrated earlier , that ’s just all in your head .
It ’s an illusion , though an artfully constructed one .
The notion that any person , regardless of what part of the world they com from , may be targeted by a government for arrest , imprisonment , or whatever form of aggression and punishment , simply because they ’re not in their “ proper realm , ” is , I submit to you , hideous .
Especially when we recognize that in truth , the only reason governments develop and enforce such rules – other than an occasional true xenophobe — is so that their welfare - state dependency schemes , and foreign diplomatic and militaristic adventurism and “ nation - building ” can continue unabated .
An end to such tyrannical government actions would remove any and all excuses for treating immigrants as criminals – and that would diminish government ’s power significantly ( not to mention then expose who the true racists are , since the only remaining supporters would then have to demonstrate their true colors ) .
Real solutions require we live in a rational reality .
Immigration laws are not the answer , nor are dismantling welfare programs and ending overseas military occupations in and of themselves .
The real ultimate solution is the one almost no one dares to talk about .
The total end of government altogether .
The American Empire is alive and well — and as expansive as ever .
We have established more than 700 military bases across the world , largely encircling the peripheries of Russia and China , which are now central to the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts .
The Cold War in the aftermath of World War II drove the expansion as we searched for security — and markets , to be sure .
Perhaps we now are the largest imperial power the world ever has known .
Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan trivializes the once - massive naval and air facility at Cam Ranh Bay during the Vietnam War , and we have developed “ permanent ” mega - bases in Iraq .
We engage in denial , and euphemisms abound .
Stumping for the colonial takeover of the Philippines in 1901 , Theodore Roosevelt , so fashionable today , insisted that “ there is not an imperialist in the country .
… Expansion ?
Yes . …
Expansion has been the law of our national growth . ”
Chalmers Johnson reminds us of Democrat Woodrow Wilson ’s liberal “ idealist imperialism , ” which would make the world safe for democracy .
( See Johnson ’s “ The Sorrows of Empire : Militarism , Secrecy , and the End of the Republic ” and other works . )
Deceit comes from the top .
Johnson cites neoconservative journalist Charles Krauthammer , who , as we embarked on the Afghanistan war , touted the British model and remarked that “ Afghanistan and other troubled lands today cry out for the sort of enlightened foreign administration once provided by self - confident Englishmen in jodhpurs and pith helmets . ”
Oh ?
Then why did the British with their jodhpurs and pith helmets fail in Afghanistan , as did the Russians , whether Cossacks with swords or Soviets with missiles ?
Why did the British ignominiously retreat from their empire , and why did the Soviets tuck tail and leave Afghanistan in the 1980s ?
Rather pathetic models , and hardly to be emulated , one would think .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently visited the Republic of Georgia , which Russia had invaded in 2008 in helping establish independence for two breakaway provinces .
George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice expressed outrage and sympathy for the Georgians — who sit astride the oil - rich Caucasus .
We are still at it , now in a “ bipartisan ” manner , pushing for , or appearing to push for , NATO membership for Georgia .
When asked to specify why Georgia was so important for the United States , Clinton responded with glittering generalities of support — no blank check here , only evasion .
Clinton ardently courted an informal alliance .
She reiterated the U.S. “ commitment ” to Georgia ’s sovereignty and territorial integrity .
Further , she said that the U.S. “ does not recognize spheres of influence ” — meaning Russian .
In one sense , the statement reflected our foreign policy since 1945 , while we of course maintained and expanded our own spheres of influence .
The Monroe Doctrine since the 19th century offers ample evidence , and then add the Truman Doctrine , NATO and the now - forgotten CENTO and SEATO .
The Soviet Union is history , but Russia has maintained its “ spheres of influence . ”
After the collapse of communism , Georgia and Russia renewed their economic ties , but tensions over the country ’s European ambitions , the desire of some political groups to join NATO , the discord over Georgian involvement with Chechen rebels , and Russian ambitions for the provinces of South Ossetia left Russia less than thrilled with the Georgian government .
The 2008 invasion underlined Moscow ’s determination to maintain its own “ sphere of influence . ”
The Obama administration is thoroughly committed to defense of the empire it inherited ; there is no or little retreat from the mindless expansion of American ambition .
Teddy Roosevelt would be proud .
Why are supporters of Barack Obama dismayed and shocked by his Afghanistan course , when , after all , in his 2008 campaign he promised nothing less ?
In his first presidential campaign debate with John McCain , Obama said : “ We have seen Afghanistan worsen , deteriorate .
We need more troops there .
We need more resources there . …
So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan . ”
Democrats and liberals so fear the war - loving right that they believe they must have their own adventures .
But this is not 1961 , when President John F. Kennedy told an enthralled nation that we “ we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe , in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty . ”
And thus he brought the Vietnam quagmire .
There are limits to our power ; sadly , presidential candidates will not utter that truth , whatever painful adventures we have had .
Obama might remember what he said in 2002 : “ I do n’t oppose all wars .
What I am opposed to is a dumb war .
What I am opposed to is a rash war . ”
Our diminished capacities and resources make such endeavors problematic .
We cannot ignore present realities and forget the past .
Republican National Chairman Michael Steele recently attacked the Obama administration ’s Afghanistan war efforts in a thoughtful statement .
Typically , the media jumped on him — NPR called it his “ gaffe ” — and his speech contained the media ’s Sound Bite of the Week : “ a war of Obama ’s choosing . ”
Steele ’s remarks , which include a larger criticism of the war , are worth reading in full .
[ Editor ’s note : Click here to see a transcript of Steele ’s comment . ]
Even a stopped clock is right twice a day .
The Republican ever - ready war hawks assailed Steele , who has no visible supporters within his party , let alone among Democrats .
( He is unlikely to lose his position because of this flap ; his presence is useful electorally . )
William Kristol invoked our Eleventh Commandment that political differences over foreign policy stop at the water ’s edge ( has he heard of the Internet ? ) — the usual ploy to thwart debate .
Kristol called Steele ’s remarks an “ affront ” to the Republican Party and to our “ commitment to our soldiers . ”
Sen .
McCain and his cohorts metaphorically grabbed the microphone and assailed Steele because he undermined and assaulted the basic imperial behavior of the past six decades .
Sen. Lindsay Graham , McCain ’s faithful sidekick , said , “ This is not President Obama ’s war , this is America ’s war . ”
But Steele may have been playing good politics .
The Afghanistan war is increasingly unpopular , even though for now his critique has not gained traction .
Sadly , there is little debate over the war in Afghanistan , as there is little about foreign policy generally .
Steele confronted a longstanding consensus that supports our imperial expansion — again , supported by real and imagined security interests , magnified by economic considerations , not least of which is the health of our domestic “ defense industry ” enterprise .
Our foreign policy course hardly arouses Congress , which has not raised any serious discussion since the Senate ratified the NATO treaty in 1949 , or when Congress organized to cut off funding for the Vietnam conflict .
The Senate Armed Services Committee fulfilled McCain ’s prediction that Gen. David Petraeus would be quickly and unanimously confirmed as military commander in Afghanistan .
Sen .
Robert Byrd ’s death diminished the opposition , leaving few in the Senate with the will or courage to challenge U.S. policy in that war .
As Petraeus took command of the “ international ” forces in Afghanistan , he declared that “ we are in this to win . ”
Obama ’s promise to begin withdrawing troops in July 2011 may be politely ignored .
We can be sure the general did not undertake this command to dismantle an American army .
President Obama may look back nostalgically on the simplicity of sacking Gen. Stanley McChrystal .
London mayor tells assembly he is arguing against ' dramatic and deep cuts ' in the capital
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Boris Johnson , the London mayor , today expressed fears that the government will " cut into the bone and sinew " of London 's economy which could see some of his flagship projects scrapped and frontline police numbers cut .
The Conservative mayor argued today that the Conservative - led coalition should protect London from the full scale of spending cuts being imposed on other areas because of " substantial savings " he is seeking to make at the Greater London authority .
The mayor , who served his first two years under a Labour government , issued a special pleading for the capital in light of its role as the " motor " that drives the engine of the UK economy , despite giving his backing to the coalition government 's plans to drastically cut back spending to rectify " the shambles " left by the previous government .
He told the London assembly today he is trying to " make the case " to the government against " dramatic and deep cuts " to London .
The mayor , who has made tackling crime and improving London transport two of his key objectives for the mayoralty , told members : " It would be a great mistake to cut frontline policing in this city and it would be a disastrous mistake to cut investment in transport infrastructure . "
The mayor is particularly concerned that vital tube upgrades and the £ 16bn Crossrail project – an east - to - west rail link across the capital which will increase London 's rail capacity by 10 % , remain unscathed .
Doubts about the future of Crossrail first surfaced in the runup to the general election when the then Tory shadow minister for London , Justine Greening , was unable to guarantee that the scheme would continue .
However , the mayor scotched uncertainty about the major infrastructure project , which is already underway , when he told the assembly he had spoken last month to Philip Hammond , the transport secretary , who had told him that the " whole project was going ahead as planned " , and had also secured reassurances from the prime minister , David Cameron .
Today , Johnson seemed less sure of the project 's footing as he rammed home the importance of the transport infrastructure projects going ahead .
" It is very easy to cancel these projects without incurring huge political unpopularity , " said Johnson .
" But such decisions would do huge long - term damage to London . "
Johnson believes that his efforts to cut waste and make efficiencies over the past two years should convince that cuts across the UK should not be made " pari passu " ( on an equal footing ) .
In comments that are likely to infuriate local government , which has collectively achieved billions of savings through waste cutting and efficiency gains , Johnson told the assembly : " It is quite wrong to treat us [ London ] in the same way as other more spendthrift areas of Whitehall . "
Earlier this year , Johnson appointed an adviser on a salary of £ 127,784 tasked with cutting billions of waste at the Greater London authority .
The mayor is also spending £ 1.8 m on consultants to restructure the finances of the soon - to - be abolished London Development Agency , which Johnson wants to bring in - house .
Nicholas Griffin , a former managing partner at City consultants Deloitte , told a London assembly committee yesterday that the Conservative mayor plans to cut back office functions at the strategic London body by 20 % – equivalent to almost £ 450 m over two years .
Johnson has cited a cull of jobs across GLA bodies , including more than 100 of rank - and - file staff at City Hall , as part of his drive to make efficiencies .
But John Biggs , deputy leader of the Labour group , pointed out that the mayor has at the same time increased the number of his senior team on top salaries of more than £ 100,000 to 18 .

The study of laughter provides a novel approach to the mechanisms and evolution of vocal production , perception and social behavior
Consider the bizarre events of the 1962 outbreak of contagious laughter in Tanganyika .
What began as an isolated fit of laughter ( and sometimes crying ) in a group of 12 - to 18 - year - old schoolgirls rapidly rose to epidemic proportions .
Contagious laughter propagated from one individual to the next , eventually infecting adjacent communities .
The epidemic was so severe that it required the closing of schools .
It lasted for six months .
The Tanganyikan laughter epidemic is a dramatic example of the infectious power of laughter - something that many of us may have experienced in our own lives .
Many readers will be familiar with the laugh tracks of television situation comedies - attempts to stimulate contagious laughter in viewers - and the difficulty of extinguishing their own " laugh jags , " fits of nearly uncontrollable laughter .
Have you ever been overcome by a comparable urge to chant " hello - hello - hello ? "
Rather than dismissing contagious laughter as a behavioral curiosity , we should recognize it and other laugh - related phenomena as clues to broader and deeper issues .
Clearly , laughter is a powerful and pervasive part of our lives - an important component of that biobehavioral bedrock of our species known as human nature .
Laughter 's significance has been recognized at various times and in various ways by such scientific and philosophical dignitaries as Aristotle , Kant , Darwin , Bergson and Freud .
Yet aside from a general appreciation that laughter is good for us -" the best medicine " - and is somehow associated with humor , we know little about laughter itself .
My approach to understanding laughter is one that a visiting extraterrestrial might take were it to encounter a group of laughing human beings .
What would the visitor make of the large bipedal animals emitting paroxysms of sound from a toothy vent in their faces ?
A reasonable approach would be to describe the simplest and most obvious aspects of the noisy behavior : its physical characteristics , the rules that govern its expression , characteristics of the animals emitting the sounds ( such as gender ) , the mechanism of sound production , and whether similar sounds are made by related species .
To Earthlings this naturalistic approach is known as ethology - a biologically oriented scientific discipline devoted to understanding what animals do and how and why they do it .
Ethologists treat behavior as an evolutionary adaptation .
The species - wide distribution of laughter and its stereotypical ( and simple ) structure suggests that the behavior has strong genetic and neurophysiological bases - qualities attractive to those who wish to understand the mechanisms and natural history of behavior .
During the past eight years I have been observing human laughter in various natural habitats - shopping malls , classrooms , sidewalks , offices and cocktail parties - with the investigative spirit of our hypothetical alien .
Observing everyday behavior in these settings has provided an opportunity to appreciate laughter as a social vocalization of the human animal .
These studies have produced some unexpected insights into the phenomenon of human laughter - its social nature , the lawful relationship between laughter and speech , gender differences and the biological basis of contagion .
Laugh Structure
One of my first goals was to describe the sonic structure of human laughter .
This proved to be more difficult than !
expected .
Like other spontaneous acts , laughter often disappears when one attempts to observe it , especially in the laboratory .
Some unconventional approaches were called for .
Although I could occasionally elicit laughter from friends and colleagues during playful conversations , I was often forced to engage in shameless hamming ( something that graduate school did not prepare me for ) .
One of the most productive approaches was to encounter people in public places and simply ask them to laugh .
The request was usually answered with a burst of laughter .
About half of the laughing subjects reported that they could not laugh on command .
Indeed , we have much less conscious control over laughter than over speech .
It is easy to say " ha - ha - ha , " but difficult to laugh on cue .
We do not " speak " laughter .
In collaboration with an undergraduate assistant , Yvonne Yong , I took the recordings to the Sound Laboratory of the National Zoo in Washington , D.C.
Here the laughs were analyzed with a sound spectrograph , a device that translates a sound into an image that reveals the changes in frequency and intensity of the sound over time .
Giggles , shrieks and belly laughs replaced the laboratory 's usual sonic fare of indigo bunting songs and the calls of golden lion tamarins .
Laboratory workers gave us quizzical looks but politely refrained from asking about the origins of the sounds .
The sound spectra revealed the distinct signature of laughter .
A laugh is characterized by a series of short vowel - like notes ( syllables ) , each about 75 milliseconds long , that are repeated at regular intervals about 210 milliseconds apart .
A specific vowel sound does not define laughter , but similar vowel sounds are typically used for the notes of a given laugh .
For example , laughs have the structure of " ha - ha - ha " or " ho- ho - ho , " but not " ha - ho - ha - ho . "
There are intrinsic constraints against producing such laughs .
Try to simulate a " ha - ho - ha - ho " laugh - it should feel quite unnatural .
When there are variations in the notes , they most often involve the first or last note in a sequence .
Thus , " cha - ha - ha " or " ha - ha - ho " laughs are possible variants .
The explosively voiced blasts of a laugh have a strong harmonic structure , with each harmonic being a multiple of a low ( fundamental ) frequency .
The harmonic structure is revealed in a sound spectrogram by the evenly spaced stacks of short horizontal lines in the spectrum , the lowest of which is the fundamental frequency .
Given their higher - pitched voices , it is not surprising that the laughter of females has a higher fundamental frequency ( about 502 hertz ) than male laughter ( about 276 hertz ) .
Whether it is a deep belly laugh or a high - pitched titter , however , all human laughter is a variation of this basic form .
It is this structure that allows us to recognize laughter in spite of individual differences .
The notes and internote intervals carry most of the information that allows us to identify a sound as laughter .
If the sounds between laugh notes are edited out of a tape recording - leaving the notes separated by intervals of silence - a laugh still sounds normal .
The internote time interval carries information , but the internote expiratory sounds do not .
If the notes are removed from a recording and the gaps between intervals are closed , all that remains of laughter is a long , breathy sigh .
The stereotypic structure of a laugh is , at least in part , a result of the limitations of our vocal apparatus .
It is difficult to laugh with abnormally long note durations , such as " haaa - haaa - haaa , " or abnormally short durations ( much less than 75 milliseconds in length ) .
Likewise , normal note durations with abnormally long or short internote intervals do not occur .
Try to produce a natural laugh with a long internote interval , such as " ha------ha------ha. "
As with the natural rhythms of walking or running , there are only so many ways to laugh .
The structural simplicity of a laugh is also suggested by its reversibility .
A short segment of laughter -" ha - ha - ha " - played backward on a tape recorder still sounds rather like " ha - ha - ha . "
Indeed the sound spectrum of a laugh is similar whether scanned from left to right or from right to left - a laugh note has a high degree of temporal symmetry .
Yet one aspect of a laugh that is not symmetrical is its loudness .
Laughter is characterized by a decrescendo in which the laugh notes that are late in a sequence are usually lower in amplitude than earlier notes ( presumably because we run out of air ) .
Recordings of laughter played backward produce a bizarre - sounding crescendo .
Chimpanzee Laughter
There is a common misperception that laughter is exclusive to human beings .
From at least the time of Darwin , however , it has been known that chimpanzees and other great apes perform a laugh - like vocalization when tickled or during play
To pursue the details of this primate laughter , I teamed up with Kim Bard , who is nursery director and caregiver for young chimpanzees at the Yerkes Regional Primate Center in Atlanta .
It is a pleasure to be able to play with young chimpanzees in the pursuit of one 's science .
Chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) laughter differs in many ways from its human counterpart .
The vowel - like notes of human laughter are performed by chopping a single expiration , whereas chimpanzee laughter is a breathy panting vocalization that is produced during each brief expiration and inspiration .
Unlike human laughter , the laughter of a chimpanzee lacks discrete , vowel - like notes that have sharp leading and trailing edges on sound spectra .
Chimpanzee laughter has the sound and cadence of a handsaw cutting wood .
The sounds of chimpanzee and human laughter are sufficiently different that without viewing the characteristic " play face " and source of stimulation ( such as play and tickle ) , naive human beings may be unable to identify the chimpanzee vocalization as laughter .
You can experience the difference in production between the two forms of laughter by placing a hand on your abdomen and comparing the abdominal pulsations of chimpanzee - like panting with the smoother act of speaking " ha - ha - ha " during a single expiration .
People laugh as we speak .
If chimpanzees laugh as they speak , by producing one laugh sound per expiration and inspiration , we have identified an important and previously unrecognized constraint on the evolution of speech and language in chimpanzees and presumably other great apes .
The close coupling of laughter to breathing in chimpanzees may be evidence of a more general limitation on these animals to speak .
( In contrast to the success of teaching hundreds of signs to chimpanzees , efforts to teach them to speak English have produced meager results . )
Indeed , the inability to modulate expiratory airflow may be at least as limiting to speech as the structure of the vocal tracts of nonhuman primates .
Breathy , panting laughter is probably the primal form that dates back to the common ancestor of all great apes and people .
Human beings evolved their characteristic laughter after branching from an ancestor in common with chimpanzees ( estimated to be around six million years ago , according to DNA hybridization data ) .
It is noteworthy that chimpanzee laughter occurs almost exclusively during physical contact , or during the threat of such contact , during chasing games , wrestling or tickling .
( The individual being chased laughs the most . )
Although people laugh when tickled , most adult human laughter occurs during conversation , typically in the absence of physical contact .
Social and Linguistic Context
Laughter is a decidedly social signal , not an egocentric expression of emotion .
In the absence of stimulating media ( television , radio or books ) , people are about 30 times more likely to laugh when they are in a social situation than when they are alone .
Indeed people are more likely to smile or talk to themselves than they are to laugh when they are alone .
Aside from the obvious implication that sociality can enhance laughter and perhaps one 's mood , these observations indicate that laughter has a social function .
What can we say about laughter as communication ?
In an attempt to gather some clues , my colleagues and I have collected observations on 1,200 instances of naturally occurring human laughter .
Three undergraduate assistants ( Lisa Greisman , Tina Runyan , Michelle Bowers ) and I wandered various public gathering places where we eavesdropped on groups of laughing people .
We carefully took note of the principals engaged in the behavior - the gender of the speaker and the audience , whether the speaker or the audience laughed and what was said immediately before the laughter .
Contrary to our expectations we found that most conversational laughter is not a response to structured attempts at humor , such as jokes or stories .
Less than 20 percent of the laughter in our sample was a response to anything resembling a formal effort at humor .
Most of the laughter seemed to follow rather banal remarks , such as " Look , it 's Andre , " " Are you sure ? " and " It was nice meeting you too . "
Even our " greatest hits , " the funniest of the 1,200 pre-laugh comments were not necessarily howlers : " You do n't have to drink , just buy us drinks , " " She 's got a sex disorder - she does n't like sex , " and " Do you date within your species ? "
Mutual playfulness , in - roup feeling and positive emotional tone - not comedy - mark the social settings of most naturally occurring laughter .
Research that focuses only on the response of an audience to jokes ( a common laboratory scenario ) targets only a small subset of laughter .
One of the key features of natural laughter is its placement in speech .
Laughter is not randomly scattered throughout the speech stream .
The speaker and the audience seldom interrupt the phrase structure of speech with laughter .
In our sample of 1,200 laughs there were only eight interruptions of speech by laughter , all of them by the speaker .
Thus a speaker may say " You are going where ?... ha-ha , " but rarely " You are going ... ha - ha ... where ? "
The occurrence of laughter during pauses at the end of phrases suggests that a lawful and probably neurologically based process governs the placement of laughter in speech - a process in which speech has priority access to the single vocalization channel .
The strong and orderly relationship between laughter and speech is akin to punctuation in written communication ( and is called the punctuation effect ) .
Our field study revealed other clues about laughter in human communication .
A counterintuitive finding was that the average speaker laughs about 46 percent more often than the audience .
This finding reveals the limits of analyses that report only audience behavior - the typical approach of humor research - and neglect the social nature of the laughing relationship .
The gender of the principals involved plays a large role in determining the amount of speaker laughter .
Whether they are speakers or audiences ( in mixed - sex groups ) , females laugh more often than males .
Female speakers laugh 127 percent more than their male audience .
In contrast , male speakers laugh about 7 percent less than their female audience .
Neither males nor females laugh as much to female speakers as they do to male speakers .
( The lot of the female comedian is not an easy one - whether her audience is male or female . )
These gender differences in the pattern of laughter are at least as strong as those noted for speech by the linguist Deborah Tannen of Georgetown University .
The limited cross-cultural evidence suggests that males are the leading humor producers and that females are the leading laughers .
These differences are already present by the time that joking first appears around six years of age .
What message is being conveyed by a laughing speaker or a laughing audience ?
In some respects laughter may be a signal of dominance / submission or acceptance / rejection .
Consider the distinction between laughing with and laughing at someone .
Valuable insights about laughter 's social function will come from studies of laughter in groups of people who differ in social rank and gender .
A response of laughter by the audience may affirm or negate the spirit of the speaker 's message .
" Polite " laughter , for example , may be a forced effort on the part of the audience to signal their accord with the speaker , quite the opposite of the indignant " ha ! " A speaker , in other cases , may buffer an aggressive comment with laughter or deliver a remark using " laugh - speak , " a consciously controlled hybrid of laughter and speech .
Talk - show hosts , who are experts at shaping the course of a conversation , commonly use laugh - speak .
In this sense laughter may modify the behavior of others by shaping the emotional tone of a conversation .
Laugh Tracks and Contagion
The use of laughter to evoke laughter or a positive mood is familiar to viewers of situation comedy shows on television .
" Laugh tracks " ( dubbed - in sounds of laughter ) have accompanied most " sitcoms " since 7:00 p.m. ( Eastern Standard Time ) on September 9 , 1950 .
On that evening the Hank McCune Show - comedy about " a likeable blunderer , a devilish fellow who tries to cut corners only to find himself the sucker " - first used a laugh track to compensate for the absence of a live audience .
Despite the fact that the show was short - lived , the television industry discovered the power of laughter to evoke audience laughter .
The recording Industry recognized the seductive power of laughter shortly after World War I with the distribution of the OKeh Laugh Record , which consisted of trumpet playing that was intermittently interrupted by laughter
It remains one of the most successful novelty records of all time .
Acknowledging the commercial potential of this novelty market , Louis Armstrong , Sidney Bechet , Woody Herman and Spike Jones all attempted to cash in with laugh records of their own .
In the intervening years social scientists have confirmed that laugh tracks do indeed increase audience laughter and the audience 's rating of the humorousness of the comedy material .
However , scientists did not consider that , in the absence of a joke or a remark , laughter by itself can evoke laughter .
This is a key element in the propagation of contagious laughter .
I recently performed some investigations of the phenomenon of contagious laughter in an undergraduate psychology classroom .
The stimulus was a " laugh box " - a small battery - operated record player from a novelty store - that emitted an 18 - second span of laughter .
The " canned " laughter was played 10 times , with the beginning of each segment separated by a one - minute interval .
On the first stimulus nearly half of the students reported that they responded with laughter themselves .
( More than 90 percent reported smiling on the first stimulus . )
However , the effectiveness of the stimulus declined with each repetition until only 3 of the 128 students laughed on the tenth trial .
By that point about 75 percent of the students rated the laugh stimulus as " obnoxious . "
The negative effect of the repeated stimulus seems to go beyond the response expected from the recurrent exposure to a generic auditory stimulus , such as " Hello , my name is George . "
The reaction may reflect the deep biological significance of laughter , which in this case may be perceived as jeering or ridicule .
( Colleagues whose offices adjoin my own can attest to the aversiveness of periodic canned laughter .
Personally , find myself wincing every time one of the laugh boxes in my office is accidently activated . )
Certainly it is pleasurable to laugh at or with people , but it is quite unpleasant to be laughed at , or to be the recipient of a scornful " ha . "
Court fools and presidential aides learn early in their careers that it is safer to laugh with the boss than at him or her .
The efficacy of laughter alone to elicit laughter raises the intriguing possibility that human beings have auditory " feature detectors " - neural circuits that respond exclusively to this species - typical vocalization .
In turn , the feature detector triggers the neural circuits that generate the stereotyped action pattern of laughter .
This mechanism , involving a laugh detector that drives a laugh generator , may be the foundation of contagious laughter .
( Contagious yawning appears to involve a similar process in the visual domain . )
Those who attempt to explain away their laugh - evoked ( contagious ) laughter as nothing more than a response to a " funny " stimulus are saying that they laughed in response to a stimulus that made them laugh , a circular argument .
The structural simplicity and species - typical character of laughter makes it a prime candidate for the evolution of such a laugh detection and releasing process .
Future psychophysical studies must determine which of laughter 's parameters - note structure , note duration , internote interval and amplitude dynamics - are necessary for the perception of laughter and the activation of the hypothetical laugh detector or releasing mechanism .
Similar detectors may have evolved for universal phonemic features of speech but the variability and complexity of language and the absence of a contagious response to assay the activation of the detectors will make their discovery more difficult .
Future Directions
Now that the critical dimensions of laughter as a social stimulus and motor act have been identified , we can pursue a variety of promising issues .
Consider " pathological laughter , " a frequent and often vaguely described medical symptom .
Damage to a wide variety of brain regions produces abnormal laughter , a result consistent with the diverse emotional , respiratory , motor , cognitive and communicative aspects of the act .
The most common cases of pathological laughter are found in pseudobulbar palsy , gelastic epilepsy and psychiatric illness .
However , pathological laughter has also been reported in multiple sclerosis , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Lou Gehrig 's disease ) , and cases of tumors and lesions ( especially in the limbic system and the brain stem ) .
Particularly mystifying to both patient and clinician are sudden bursts of laughter that are not associated with a feeling of mirth or an environmental stimulus .
Here we have a segregation of the emotional , cognitive and motor mechanisms of laughter .
Other cases are more subtle .
Some people with forebrain damage have their readjustment to society impeded by a tendency to laugh at almost anything - breaches in laugh etiquette have more serious consequences than one might think .
Using our improved descriptive tools , we can now specify more precisely what is " abnormal , " " pathological " or " inappropriate " about these cases ( whether it is sonic structure , placement in speech , social context , contagion sensitivity , perception or relation to humor ) .
We may even discover new laugh - related syndromes .
The next time that you or a friend have one beer too many , you may research the age - old question of alcohol effects - while taking careful notes on a cocktail napkin , of course .
Do alcohol , " laughing gas " and other drugs known to increase laughter simply lower the threshold for laughter , or do they alter its pattern or quality ?
In aphasia ( a disorder of language production or perception ) is there sparing of laughter and , if so , which of laughter 's several dimensions are spared ?
Does vocal laughter punctuate the signed speech of the congenitally deaf , in whom there is not a shared organ of expression ?
The left cerebral hemisphere has a specialized role in language - is this also true of the production or perception of laughter ?
Many developmental issues remain open .
Laughter typically appears in human babies around 3 - 1/ 2 to 4 months of age , but we know little about the details of the developmental process .
Must babies hear their own laughter or the laughter of others for laughter to mature ?
If so , is there a critical period during which such laughter must be experienced ?
The report of laughter in a few congenitally deaf - blind children suggests that at least some features of laughter develop without benefit of auditory and visual stimulation , evidence of a strong maturational and genetic basis .
For a more satisfying account of laugh acquisition , we must conduct high - resolution studies that contrast the development of normal and hearing - impaired children .
All of us have encountered people with bizarre - sounding laughter .
What is different about such laughter and what does this tell us about the mechanism of normal laugh production ?
Do these odd types of laughter run in families ?
If so , what is the nature of its development and heritability ?
In my otherwise forgettable high - school physics class there was a kid who brayed like a donkey when he laughed .
Where is Roger now that I need him ?
Comparative studies may provide clues about both the evolution and social function of laughter .
Does the low level of conscious control that we have over our own laughter reflect the typical level of control that non-uman animals have over their own species - typical vocalizations ?
Do the great apes show the sexually dimorphic or contagious laughter described in human beings ?
Does the pattern of laughter vary with rank within a troop ?
Aside from the great apes , do other animals produce laugh - like vocalizations ?
How do the neurobehavioral mechanisms of laugh production vary between species ?
Tickle may be a kind of Rosetta Stone for such comparative laugh research because it triggers laugh - like vocalizations in all of the great apes and perhaps other species .
Can you tickle your pet dog or cat ?
How can you tell ?
Is a laugh - evoking stimulus that works equally well in a variety of species the ultimate example of " low " humor ?
Laughter research is still in its infancy , an exciting time when the frontiers are near at hand and accessible with modest resources .
Certainly much of the research described in this article can be replicated or extended by almost anyone , making it suitable for college or even high school research projects .
Laughter research is a reminder that not all science concerns arcane or narrow problems .
We should resist neglecting or trivializing the commonplace .
There are rewards for approaching nature with a naive curiosity and attempting to see the familiar in new ways .

Brian Duffy , whose photographs helped define the mood of the Swinging Sixties , has died aged 76 .
Together with David Bailey and Terence Donovan , Duffy formed part of the trinity of photographers who became as famous as the models , musicians and film stars they worked with .
He had been suffering from lung disease .
Like Bailey and Donovan , Duffy was born in London 's East End .
He studied dress design at St Martin 's School of Art and worked as a fashion artist for Harper 's Bazaar before turning to photography .
He was one of just a handful of photographers to shoot two Pirelli calenders , and was credited for his inventive approach to fashion photography .
His work also spanned reportage and advertising , including two award - winning campaigns for Benson & Hedges and Smirnoff in the 1970s .
He shot three David Bowie album covers , including Aladdin Sane .
In 1979 , Duffy decided to give up photography and burned many of his negatives in a bin .
But he resumed taking pictures in 2009 , and in January the story of his career was the subject of the BBC documentary The Man Who Shot the 60s .
He is survived by his wife , June , two sons and two daughters .

ABOUT 500 protesters took part in a demonstration in Dublin yesterday calling for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador to Ireland and safe passage for the Rachel Corrie aid vessel which is en route to Gaza .
The protesters marched under Palestinian and Turkish flags , following five coffins symbolising some of those who lost their lives on Monday when an aid flotilla carrying supplies intended for Gaza was raided by Israeli commandos .
Starting at the Central Bank plaza , the protest moved to the Dáil before reaching the Israeli embassy where demonstrators staged a sit - down protest and observed a minute ’s silence for the nine activists who died .
A group of protesters vowed to stay overnight to surround and shut down the embassy .
Among those who addressed the crowd were Irish passport - holder Issam Ben Ali , originally from Libya , who was one of those in the flotilla , Labour TD Joe Costello and Rev Patrick Comerford .
March organiser and chairman of the Irish Anti-War Movement Richard Boyd Barrett said Israel ’s attempts to justify its actions as self - defence had to be utterly rejected .
“ The victims of Israel ’s brutal attack were humanitarian and peace activists , whose only crime was seeking to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza , ” he said .
“ Here in Ireland , we must demand that our Government takes genuine action against Israel .
Words of criticism or a rap over the knuckles from Micheál Martin are not enough .
The Israeli ambassador should be expelled from this country and all trade and diplomatic links with Israel must be severed . ”
Jerusalem ( CNN ) -- Jerusalem municipal officials Tuesday defended the demolition of three Palestinian homes -- including one that was inhabited -- in two East Jerusalem neighborhoods , saying they were built without legal permits and the demolitions were court - ordered .
However , Palestinians expressed outrage at the actions , with a member of the Fatah revolutionary council calling Monday 's demolitions " a clear statement " from the Israeli government on the Mideast peace process .
The Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions group said one of the homes , in the Beit Hanina area , was inhabited , although the family was not home at the time .
The demolition is the first this year of an inhabited home , according to group spokeswoman Sahar Varbi , and four of the six people who lived there are children .
In the Issawaieh village , two uninhabited homes under construction and a shed were razed .
One house was being built by a single mother of five , who fainted on the scene of the demolition and was taken to a local hospital .
" I have been building this house since 16 years ago , " Bassem Abu Rimaileh , who owned one of the other demolished Issawaieh homes , said Tuesday .
" I was saving money slowly to build this house and live with my family , " he said .
" I was surprised when the municipality workers and border police showed up this morning without a prior warning except 10 days ago , saying that I had [ a ] demolition order and demolished the house .
I did not have enough time to resort to [ the ] legal process to stop this demolition order .
I am a father of six children and have been saving all my life to live in this house . "
Such demolitions typically feature a large number of border police and special forces officers and use bulldozers to raze the structures .
The Beit Hanina home was built on the rubble of previous construction , demolished in January 2008 , according to Stephan Miller , spokesman for Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat .
The former mayor had signed the administrative demolition order , and regional courts denied requests to delay it , Miller said .
All the Issawaieh structures were being built in an area where construction is not allowed , Miller said .
A regional court denied a request to stay the demolition of one , he said .
Housing in East Jerusalem has become a hot - button issue in the Mideast peace process .
In March , the Israeli government announced the construction of 1,600 housing units in East Jerusalem as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden was visiting the Jewish state .
The announcement outraged the Obama administration and led to the Palestinian withdrawal from agreed - upon indirect negotiations with Israel .
In a visit later that month to the United States , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was presented with a set of concessions that the White House wanted to see Israel make in an effort to restart negotiations with the Palestinians .
Neither government detailed what the exact nature of the concessions were , but sources on both sides said a halt in East Jerusalem construction was among the demands from the Obama administration .
However , Netanyahu has said there will be no freeze on building in East Jerusalem .
Israel seized East Jerusalem from Jordan during the Six - Day War in 1967 and considers it part of its sovereign capital -- a claim not recognized by the international community .
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the future capital of their state .
The demolitions come a day after Jerusalem municipal officials announced the construction of 32 settlement units in East Jerusalem .
Fatah revolutionary council member Dimitri Dilani said the demolitions are taking place shortly before the visit of U.S. President Barack Obama 's Mideast envoy , George Mitchell , and are " a clear statement from the right - wing Israeli government vis-a - vis the peace process , the indirect talks . "
He said he also believes that the demolitions come as a result of the meeting between Obama and Netanyahu " in which , obviously , Prime Minister Netanyahu has received some leeway in breaking international law and violating our rights as people under occupation in East Jerusalem , " Dilani said .

Transformers 2 was a nonsensical train wreck .
Cast and crew promised the next would be better ( possibly even scripted ! ) .
Well , the NASCAR vehicles in Jalopnik - reader Dylan 's Transformers 3 set photos indicate otherwise .
Maybe they 'll only fight while turning left .

Yes , we ran set photos from Transformers 3 filming in Chicago earlier , but they did n't include the horror of NASCAR vehicles on set .
As we all know , the way for alien robots to be inconspicuous in a major urban area is to hide in plain sight disguised as brightly painted race cars .
We 're counting at least three different cars , which means maybe they 'll be a deliciously stereotyped trio of hilarious redneck robots .
Hey , it worked with knock - down , drag - out , smack - you - in - the - face funny stereotypes of black people in the form of the Beat and Trax twins from TF2 .

Just think of the marketing machine that 'll crank up when these these bad boys hit the silver screen .
NASCAR and Transformers , together at last , pummeling you into a whimpering heap of consumer submission .

A Minnesota woman , Jammie Thomas - Rasset , faced similar allegations and fought the recording industry in two federal trials .
Earlier this year , a judge reduced a jury award of $ 1.9 million for the industry to $ 54,000 in her second trial , and the industry offered to settle the case with her for $ 25,000 .
Thomas - Rasset rejected the settlement , and the case is now poised to go to trial for a third time .
The lawsuit by the record labels against Tenenbaum was only the second in the nation to go to trial in a federal court .
Nonetheless , Nesson praised Gertner for “ recognizing the abusiveness of the copyright litigation campaign being conducted ’’ by the recording and movie industries against people who illegally download music and films .
Tenenbaum ’s lawyer , Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson , said he is inclined to appeal the $ 67,500 award as still unconstitutionally excessive to the First Circuit Court of Appeals but must speak first with his client .
Gertner ’s ruling “ appropriately recognized the egregious conduct ’’ of Tenenbaum but dismissed the “ profound economic and artistic harm ’’ to the recording industry from illegal music sharing , the statement said .
The RIAA said it would “ contest this ruling ’’ but declined to specify how .
The Recording Industry Association of America , a Washington - based trade group that represents the record labels , issued a statement saying , “ With this decision , the court has substituted its judgment for that of 10 jurors as well as Congress . ’’
“ It ’s basically equally unpayable to me , ’’ said the 26 - year - old doctoral student in physics and former Providence resident who infringed on the copyrights of songs such as Nirvana ’s “ Come as You Are ’ ’ and Beck ’s “ Loser . ’’
Tenenbaum , who had not read the decision when a reporter called him yesterday afternoon , said he welcomed any reduction but he could not afford $ 67,500 either .
Congress , she said , never envisioned that the Digital Theft Deterrence Act of 1999 would subject people like Tenenbaum to huge statutory damages for violating copyright law through illegal file sharing .
But the reduction , she said , also sends an equally important message that the constitutional protection against grossly excessive punitive awards in civil suits protects not only big corporations but “ ordinary people like Joel Tenenbaum . ’’
“ There is no question that this reduced award is still severe , even harsh , ’’ she wrote in a 62 - page order .
“ It not only adequately compensates the plaintiffs for the relatively minor harm that Tenenbaum caused them ; it sends a strong message that those who exploit peer - to - peer networks to unlawfully download and distribute copyrighted works run the risk of in curring substantial damages awards . ’’
US District Court Judge Nancy Gertner ruled that the amount a federal jury ordered Joel Tenenbaum to pay last July was “ unconstitutionally excessive ’’ in light of what she described as the modest harm caused to the record labels .
She cut the award to $ 67,500 , one - tenth the original sum .
In a major setback for the recording industry , a Boston judge yesterday slashed by 90 percent a $ 675,000 damages award that a Boston University graduate student had been ordered to pay to four record labels for illegally downloading 30 songs and sharing them online .
Tenenbaum is among thousands of people in recent years to receive letters from the RIAA demanding payment for illegal file sharing .
The vast majority have settled out of court for $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 .
In Tenenbaum ’s case , the jury reached its verdict the day after he unapologetically admitted from the witness stand that he had illegally downloaded and shared hundreds of songs from 1999 to at least 2007 through peer - to - peer networks .
The record labels presented evidence that he shared thousands of files .
Under the federal statute , Tenenbaum could have been ordered to pay as much as $ 150,000 for each song , or a total of $ 4.5 million , because the jury concluded that the infringements were “ willful . ’’
The law required that jurors award at least $ 750 for each infringement .
The jury ended up awarding the labels $ 22,500 for each infringement , or $ 675,000 total .
Nesson had argued in February that Tenenbaum caused no more than $ 21 in damages to the labels for downloading and sharing 30 songs .
If Tenenbaum had bought the songs legally on iTunes , Nesson explained , the student would have paid 99 cents for each , and the record labels would have received 70 cents from Apple .
In her ruling , Gertner wrote that Tenenbaum flouted the law for years by illegally sharing music online .
His behavior , she wrote , was “ hardly exemplary . ’’
Nonetheless , she said , his actions were roughly comparable to those of Thomas - Rasset .
After her second trial , a federal judge slashed the award for each infringement to $ 2,250 , three times the statutory minimum of $ 750 .
Gertner said that sum seemed appropriate and cut the award for each of Tenenbaum ’s infringements to that amount .
“ Some will undoubtedly murmur that my decision to draw the constitutional line at $ 2,250 per infringed work is to some extent arbitrary , ’’ Gertner wrote .
But the total of $ 67,500 , she said , is “ higher than I might have awarded in my own independent judgment and is the maximum that the Constitution will permit given the facts of this case . ’’
Gertner rejected a key argument by the record labels that one cannot look at Tenenbaum ’s actions in isolation given the economic impact of illegal downloading on the industry .
“ While the plaintiffs argue that they have lost billions of dollars in revenue due to file sharing , the jury was not permitted to punish Tenenbaum for harm caused by other infringers , ’’ she wrote .
Andrew Beckerman - Rodau , a professor at Suffolk Law School who specializes in intellectual property law , said yesterday that judges frequently reduce damages awards by jurors who are sometimes swayed by emotion .
In this case , he said , it was hard for a jury to come up with a reasonable award because Congress set up a broad range of penalties for copyright infringements like Tenenbaum ’s — from $ 750 to $ 150,000 per song .
The four labels that won the damages award are Sony BMG Music Entertainment , Warner Bros .
Records Inc. , Arista Records LLC , and UMG Recordings Inc .
After years of suing thousands of people for allegedly stealing music online — a tactic that created a public relations nightmare for the recording industry — the RIAA announced in December 2008 that it was going to stop filing suits .
But it said it would continue to litigate cases that already were making their way through courts .

The team is looking for a sarcophagus like this one discovered 100 years ago
A lost ancient Egyptian tomb has been rediscovered by archaeologists in the desert sands south of Cairo .
The 3,300 - year - old tomb is believed to belong to a mayor of the ancient capital of Memphis .
It was originally discovered by artefact hunters in the 19th Century , who then lost the tomb 's location .
The tomb was located by a team of Egyptian researchers after a five - year search and they are hopeful mummified remains are still inside .
Nile hunt carvings
The tomb belongs to Ptahmes , who was also army chief , overseer of the treasury and a royal scribe under the Pharaohs Seti I and his son Ramses II , during the 13th Century BC .
" Since 1885 the tomb has been covered in sand and no - one knew about it , " Professor Ola el - Aguizy of Cairo University said .
" It is important because this tomb was the lost tomb . "
The 70 m - long tomb , located in the Saqarra necropolis , contains carvings depicting Ptahmes and his family hunting and fishing on the Nile River .
The team is still looking for the main chamber where it is believed the mummified remains and sarcophagus of the occupants may still remain .
AMSTERDAM , June 3 ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Dutch cyclists chatting on the mobile phones are an ubiquitous site in the bike - friendly city of Amsterdam and soon they will be able to charge their mobiles with bike power .
Nokia
Oyj introduced a bicycle charger on Thursday aimed at developing countries with limited access to electricity , but the cellphone maker said the idea could catch on in Europe where cycling for work , shopping and errands is a common lifestyle .
“ We are targeting the initial rollout in the developing markets , but we do , of course , see the potential outside of these countries , ” said Nokia spokesman Leo McKay .
“ In cities like Amsterdam for instance , where bicycles are probably the most common means of transportation , the supply of free , environmentally friendly power is pretty much limitless . ”
The charger will go on sale for about 15 euros later this year , Nokia said .

An optimist is someone who looks at the bright side of life and expects good things to happen .
A ‘ cock - eyed ’ optimist is one who believes , against all the odds , that everything will turn out all right in the end .
Against this , the pessimist looks at the dark side of life and expects bad things to happen .
A ‘dyed in the wool ’ pessimist is one who believes that everything will turn out badly in the end .
On the face of it , pessimists seems to have sober reason on their side .
For the pessimist , we have to be realistic , and the fact is that everything will eventually come crashing down .
Entropy takes care of the end of things , and that end is increasingly chaotic .
All systems move from a more to a less ordered state , until finally , they cease to exist .
Our lives are like this .
We are little anti-entropy machines , and our living bodies try to keep back the encroaching disintegration .
In this they are successful for awhile , but , in the end , our bodies succumb to the forces of decay and finally move to the disordered state we call death .
For the pessimist , the world is a disaster waiting to happen , and the optimist is simply living in an illusion .
Some systematic differences have been pointed out between the two approaches to life .
First is the old saw about whether the bottle of wine is half full or half empty .
The truth is that the bottle is both half full and half empty , and it is entirely up to the person whether to be happy or sad about this .
It is the individual ’s choice to be happy having half a bottle left , or sad that it is half gone .
Another difference between them is that the pessimist sees negative outcomes as the norm , while the optimist sees positive outcomes as the norm .
The result is that when an obstacle arises , the optimist sees it as a temporary and local problem that can be overcome .
The pessimist sees a problem or obstacle as what is to be expected , and getting a good result as the exception .
It might be argued that the pessimist has the right in this , because , if one predicts a bad result that does not materialize , one is pleasantly surprised , whereas , if the bad result occurs , one takes it as only what is to be expected and is therefore not so affected by it as an optimist would be .
Despite this , there is currently much discussion about the value of optimism as an operational principle .
It is claimed that the optimistic person is happier than the pessimist , travels more hopefully , is healthier and lives longer .
In addition , the optimist is said to be more resilient and better able to cope with life ’s setbacks .
It is true that bad things can happen and often do , but the opposite is also true .
The optimist does not have to be ‘ cock - eyed ’ .
It is possible to be a realist and a moderate optimist at the same time .
Optimism is more about maintaining a positive attitude than anything else .
Pessimists do not pursue difficult projects because they are sure that they will fail before starting .
It is hard to get moving on a project when what is before one ’s mind are all the things that might , and probably will , go wrong .
An optimist has a ‘ can do ’ approach that concentrates more on success than failure , while recognizing the problems more as opportunities to make progress than as crippling setbacks .
The sort of optimism that pessimists decry is really a silly kind of unjustified belief that the future will bring whatever one hopes will come to pass .
However , another kind of optimism is not a matter of belief but of attitude .
It is really more about having faith in one ’s own competence than a matter of belief .
It is the feeling that one will be able to cope with whatever happens as it comes along .
Of course , there will come a time when one will not be able to cope with some disaster or another .
However , the optimist does not let that stop him or her from acting to prevent it or to pursue some other course of action , even while knowing that eventually everything comes to nothing .
My conclusion , therefore , is that the rational choice is for optimism , despite the fact that nothing lasts and all accomplishments eventually come to nothing .
I would summarize my position as long term pessimism combined with short term optimism .
And since our lives are short , it is best , from a practical point of view , to cultivate optimism as a modus operandi for our lives .
To expect disaster and failure as the norm may protect one from being too disappointed when things go wrong , but that is no way to live .
It is always possible to look at the world pessimistically or optimistically .
The choice is ours .

Another sign of the imminent return of the Deutsche Mark comes this weekend courtesy of BoersenNEWS.de , one of the largest German stock market portals .
Due to popular demand , the portal has reintroduced quotations in DEM , alongside those in EUR : " Due to the ongoing Euro crisis many investors expect the return of the Deutsche Mark .
A recent survey , showed that 39 % of 1,364 börsennews .de users , would like the good old Deutsche Mark reintroduced .
Börsennews.de has responded and will immediately display share prices in Euro and Deutsche Mark . "
The commentary on this symbolic switch is enough to indicate just how the majority of Germany feels about this issue : " With the symbolic reinstatement of the Deutsche Mark Börsennews .
de is not supporting to the abolition of the Euro , however the desire of many citizens for economic security .
One thing is clear , the German Mark represented the economically strong and healthy Germany .
The Euro represents a cracked economic system , not only throughout the world , in Europe , but above all in Germany . "
We could n't have said it better ourselves .
Suddenly , Jim Rickards ' observation that Germany and Russia could be very well considering a new gold - and oil - backed currency , does not seem all that very ludicrous to us .
In fact , should the two countries indeed be in such deliberations ( and for their literal recent proximity , look no further than the seating chart in this year 's Mayday parade in Moscow ) , the end of fiat could be approaching much faster than previously expected .
More from BoersenNews.de :
There is , of course , no way of knowing what new challenges and new possibilities will emerge over the next 40 years .
There is no way of knowing how life will be different in 2050 .
But if we do what ’s required in our own time , I am confident the future will be brighter for our people , and our country .
Such confidence stems largely from the genius of America .
From our earliest days , we have reimagined and remade ourselves again and again .
Colonists in the 1750s could n’t have imagined that 40 years later , they would be living in a nation , independent of empire .
Farmers in the first decades of the 19th century could n’t have imagined that 40 years later , their continent would be crisscrossed by a railroad linking Eastern ports to Western markets .
More recently , my parents ’ generation could n’t have imagined , as children , a world transformed by the Internet .
That we have constantly transformed ourselves is a testament to our people — our entrepreneurs and innovators , scientists and engineers , dreamers , tinkerers and makers of things .
It is also a testament to our times .
For thousands of years , people on every continent lived much the same way their parents and grandparents lived .
But over the past few centuries , the pace of change has steadily picked up , and today new technologies and innovations are coming faster than ever , replacing the ones that preceded them .
Much of the innovation reshaping our world comes from the private sector .
Rightly so .
Our businesses have always been a force for dynamism .
But there is also a role for government in helping us adapt to — and shape — the future .
From the Erie Canal to space exploration to what became the Internet , we ’ve always come together to spur transformation .
That is a commitment my administration has upheld .
Over the past year , we ’ve made the largest investment in basic research funding in history ; it ’s an investment with the potential to spark new technologies , new treatments and new breakthroughs we ca n’t foresee .
Beyond our investments in basic research , I believe a greater focus in two areas — education and energy — can help fortify America to meet the tests and seize the opportunities of the century that lies ahead .
In the 19th century , we built land - grant institutions to prepare an agricultural nation for an industrializing world .
In the 20th century , we sent a generation of veterans to college on the G.I.
Bill , laying the groundwork for our great middle class and decades of prosperity .
Today , a similar commitment is required , not only to prepare our kids to outcompete workers around the world , but to prepare America to outcompete nations around the world .
That is why we ’ve taken steps to increase Pell Grants and ensure they keep pace with inflation , making college — and advanced training — more affordable for countless students .
That ’s why we ended a status quo that handed out billions of dollars to banks to act as unnecessary middlemen in administering student loans , and made the repayment of loans more manageable for students so they do n’t graduate with crushing debts .
And that ’s why we ’re undertaking a Race to the Top in America ’s schools , challenging states to compete for tax dollars to help them deliver better results in the classroom .
Just as we are rising to meet our education challenge , we must rise to meet our energy challenge .
From Franklin ’s experiments with lightning to the research labs of today , we ’ve always sought out new forms of energy .
As I write this , the tragic oil spill along the Gulf Coast is threatening livelihoods and America ’s precious natural bounty , making the need for clean energy all the more urgent .
Meanwhile , other nations — from China to Germany — are racing to build a clean energy future , recognizing that it holds the key to new jobs and new industries in this young century .
If we hope to continue leading the global economy , America must place first in that race .
That ’s why we ’re making the most significant investment in clean energy in history , offering grants to companies that produce wind turbines and solar panels , helping us double renewable energy production in the coming years .
That ’s why we ’ve helped forge one historic agreement — and are on track to produce a second — to dramatically increase the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks .
And that ’s why I ’ll keep fighting for comprehensive energy and climate legislation — to unleash the potential of clean energy for our economy , our security and our environment .
When I was sworn into office , I had a chance to request objects from some of America ’s finest museums to put on display in the White House .
One of my requests was for patent models from the Smithsonian National Museum of American History : Samuel Morse ’s 1849 design for a telegraph register ; Henry Williams ’ 1877 design for a steamboat wheel ; and John A. Peer ’s 1874 design for a gear - cutting machine .
They rest on the bookshelves in the Oval Office , and I see them every day .
For me , they are a reminder of what has always defined America ’s people : our spirit ; a restless searching for the right solution to any problem ; an inclination to dream big dreams , and an insistence on making those dreams come true ; an enduring faith , even in the darkest hours , that brighter days lie ahead .
That is the genius of America .
And that ’s why , even though I can’t predict what will happen over the next 40 years , I am — and always will be — full of hope about what the future holds .
Barack Obama is the president of the United States .
Britain is " on the road to ruin " unless action is taken in the Budget on Tuesday to cut the deficit , Chancellor George Osborne has told the BBC .
Mr Osborne said the coalition had inherited " a truly awful financial situation " and he would set out a four - year plan to deal with it .
Tough action was " unavoidable " but he aimed to provide " prosperity for all " .
He also announced ex-Labour minister John Hutton would head a commission into public sector pensions .
Mr Osborne told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that Mr Hutton 's involvement would mean the commission into future pensions would be independent and have cross -party input .
' Decisive action '
The chancellor refused to give more details of the coming Budget , although the BBC understands it will include Conservative election proposals to ease National Insurance for new businesses .
It is expected the employers ' threshold for NI will rise slightly - by £ 21 and Universities Minister David Willetts confirmed on the BBC's Politics
Show there would be measures to boost firms outside the South East of England .
This is expected to take the form of a three - year scheme to exempt start - up firms elsewhere in the UK from paying NI for the first 10 people employed .
Mr Osborne did not comment when asked about that suggestion , but did confirm there would be a levy on banks and an increase in non-business capital gains tax .
Asked about the " badness " of the Budget , he said : " I do n't see it as badness , I see it as decisive action to deal with Britain 's record budget deficit .
Analysis
All eyes on Budget day will be on the chancellor but watch closely too the Liberal Democrat benches .
The word from the Treasury is that the budget was signed off not only by David Cameron and George Osborne , but also by Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander .
The implicit message - the Lib Dems are fully signed up to the cuts package .
Only , perhaps that should read - the Lib Dem leadership are fully signed up .
For when the Lib Dem chief secretary Danny Alexander unveiled his £ 2bn cuts package earlier this week - just one solitary Lib Dem rose to support him .
There 's also been a deafening silence from other senior Lib Dems .
Has anyone heard much from Paddy Ashdown , Ming Campbell or Charles Kennedy recently ?
Labour too sense the Lib Dems are getting the jitters .
Hence Ed Milliband 's depiction of Nick Clegg as a " crypto Tory " .
So come Budget day - expect Mr Clegg to be casting anxious glances over his shoulder towards his own party .
What should be in the Budget ?
Nick Robinson : Why Hutton ?
Hutton to head review of pensions
" We sit here as the country in Europe with the largest budget deficit of any major economy at a time when markets and investors and business are looking around the world at countries that can't control their debts .
" And so we 've got to deal with that .
In that sense it's an unavoidable budget , but what I 'm determined to do is to make sure that the measures are tough but they 're also fair and that we 're all in this together and that , as a country , we take the steps necessary to actually provide the prosperity for the future . "
But amid continuing speculation about large scale spending cuts , Labour leadership hopeful Ed Balls warned that the government was on course to " repeat the mistakes of the 1930s " .
He said the cuts and tax rises set to be announced in Tuesday 's Budget - which he expected to include VAT increases - showed the " unfairness " of the Conservative - Liberal Democrat government 's policies .
Fellow Labour leadership contender Andy Burnham said the Lib Dems had " sold their souls " for jobs in government .
Shadow chancellor Alistair Darling said the Conservatives were " using the current circumstances " as an excuse to make " ideologically driven " cuts they had planned anyway and were " using " the Lib Dems " as cover " .
While Mr Osborne declined to set out more detail of what would be in Tuesday 's Budget , Prime Minister David Cameron has already suggested public sector pay and pensions will have to be restrained .
He said the budget deficit could not be dealt with by " just hitting either the rich or the welfare scrounger " and the Budget would be when " the rubber really hits the road " .
Senior Tories and Lib Dems signed off the Budget on Friday with Mr Cameron , Chancellor George Osborne , Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander all present .
Forecaster 's warning
The involvement of so many high level figures from the two parties is being seen as an attempt to show the coalition is fully on board with the decisions to be announced in Mr Osborne 's first Budget , on Tuesday .
One area of possible unhappiness among Lib Dems might be raising VAT - deputy leader Simon Hughes said " all " Lib Dems have been against it " because it 's what 's called a regressive tax , everyone pays it irrespective of the wealth you have " .
Asked if it would be acceptable for the Budget to include an increase VAT , he said : " It wo n't be the most desirable outcome . "
There have been suggestions some state benefits could be frozen and a survey by ComRes for the Independent on Sunday found 53 % of the public backed stripping child benefit from wealthier families - including 47 % of Labour voters - with 42 % opposed to the idea .
But the government 's poverty adviser , Labour MP Frank Field , said he was opposed to means - testing child benefit , which costs taxpayers about £ 11bn a year .
So many of the factors are not under the chancellor 's control .
The two most important are the animal spirits of the British middle classes , and luck Bruce Anderson , The Independent Read your comments Read more comment and analysis from around the web at See Also
Meanwhile , the influential economic forecaster the Ernst and Young Item Club , which uses the Treasury 's own models to make its predictions , said £ 48 bn worth of spending cuts and tax rises were needed to eradicate the part of the deficit which would not melt away with economic recovery .
Mr Osborne confirmed that Capital Gains
Tax would rise in the Budget , despite a free market think tank , the Adam Smith Institute , warning it could actually cost the government as much as £ 2.48 bn in lost revenues .
It argues that higher tax rates will discourage individuals from selling assets , denying the government the CGT they would gain from the sale .
About a year ago , Kent Wilson wrote an article which mentioned the tendency of certain teams to draft an atypically large number of players from certain leagues .
The article is actually is actually entitled " The Best Player Available Myth , " so that right there should give you an idea of what it 's about .
The whole article is well worth a read but I 'm going to focus on the following excerpt from that article for today 's piece :
" This may be why clubs develop what I call " fishing holes " , by which I mean they concentrate their scouting in certain amateur / developmental leagues ( for the Flames , it 's the WHL / CHL ) - they can become familiar with the relative degree and value of the competition and therefore can more capably gauge a prospects level of performance . "
Now , the Flames are an extreme example drafting more players from one league ( WHL ) than any other NHL club but it is true that all teams have their own " fishing holes , " i.e. areas where they draft proportionally more players than the rest of the league .
After the jump we 'll take a look at the tendencies for all thirty NHL teams .
What I 've done in the following charts is taken all of the players selected in the last five NHL entry drafts ( 2005 - 2009 ) and calculated what percentage of draftees were taken from each league .
Here are the percentages for each of the leagues :
The next several charts will group teams by division and look at how much their draft tendencies diverge from the NHL norms listed above .
Each chart will be colour - coded with " hot " spots ( marked in red ) and " cold " spots ( marked in blue ) .
The more pronounced the shading is , the more that team diverges from the league norm .
If the team stays within 2 % of the league average , there is no shading , a difference of 2 - 5 % gets light shading , 5 - 10 % more pronounced and 10 % + is brightly coloured .
I 'll use the WHL as an example : a team that drafted between 14.01 % and 18.01 % of their prospects from the WHL receives no shading .
Between 11.01 % and 14.01 % would be shaded lightly blue , 6.01 % and 11.01 % a more pronounced blue and anything less than 6.01 % bright blue .
Between 18.01 % and 21.01 % would be shaded lightly red , 21.01 % and 26.01 % a more pronounced red and 26.01 % or more , bright red .
One of the fun ways that this data may help is in looking at prospects leading up to the draft .
The Oilers , for instance , have a couple of second round picks and I know that I 'll be taking a closer look at the Swedish prospects slated for the second round a bit more closely as we approach the draft .
Here 's a quick synopsis of each team 's favourite and least favourite spots relative to league average :
And now , just a few quick notes on some things I found interesting :
The Los Angeles Kings had the most draft picks of any team over the last five years with 46 .
They also happen to diverge less from league norms than many of the other clubs .
This should warn us to take the data with a grain of salt , especially the areas that are lightly shaded .
The sample size here just is n't very large .
No one had fewer draft picks than the Vancouver Canucks who ended up with only 29 .
In that the draft was seven rounds all five years , a team would have 35 picks if they made no trades and always signed their first round picks .
Several teams took one player from a less prominent league .
The Thrashers took one player from the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League , the Bluejackets one from the Manitoba Junior Hockey League , the Avalanche one player from a Norwegian league , the Kings one from the Quebec Junior AAA Hockey League , the Wild one from a Belarussian league , the Devils one from the Atlantic Junior Hockey League , the Rangers one from the Western Ontario Junior B Hockey League and the Maple Leafs one from the Alberta AAA Midget Hockey League .
And then there 's the Senators .
They selected one player from the Kootneay International Junior Hockey League , one player from a Latvian league and one player from a Canadian high school .
They 're also one of two teams - the other is Chicago - who have all three of the CHL leagues as " cold spots . "
The Boston Bruins , Phoenix Coyotes and New York Rangers drafted 11 Czechs over the last five years .
The rest of the NHL drafted 14 .
NHL teams took more players out of the BCHL than they did out of the Czech Republic and more out of the AJHL than they did out of Slovakia .
Those leagues are really hurting for young talent .
The Dallas Stars must take kids out of the smaller leagues on purpose .
Their " hot spots " are the BCHL , the OPJHL , US high school and US midget .
All of those players are on track to go the NCAA route but the Stars may also feel that those players get fewer views from other teams and thus they have a better chance at uncovering a very talented player .
The Pittsburgh Penguins did n't select a single player from the WHL in the last five years .
Darryl Sutter stands in awe of their foolishness .
The Minnesota Wild and Calgary Flames love players from the WHL .
Somewhat surprisingly , the Oilers really do n't and yet they still trusted their WHL scout and took Cameron Abney .
So weird .
In perhaps the least surprising revelation on the chart , the Wild also love US high schoolers .
The Carolina Hurricanes have n't taken a single player from a US high school or the USHL ( outside of the U18 team ) .
I wonder if they bother scouting that area .
The next project will be to check the hot spots for these teams and see if they 've had more success than usual finding good players in these areas , so look for that sometime before the draft .

It is important to begin these impressions of Venezuela by explaining that our time in this country , in which we have been lucky enough to get beneath the surface , has confirmed suspicions that 90 per cent of what we hear about Venezuela in Australia is utter nonsense .
It ’s not in the paper it is on the wall - the US is at war with Venezuela , the country with the world ’s largest oil reserves and the fourth largest of natural gas .
The US has had control of these resources since their discovery over a hundred years ago via hand - picked dictatorships and false democracies .
They have lost control of this country , thanks , not to Chavez , but to the poor majority he inspires .
However , US strategy is clear , and thinking back to Australian media and the information we receive about Venezuela , I fear they are winning .
It ’s a simple yet sophisticated strategy used against many countries to justify interference or attack .
Since the failed US - backed coup against the democratically elected President Chavez in April of 2002 , the US have switched to Plan B , which is a campaign to swing global public opinion , through its influence over international media , against the Chavez government to justify overthrowing it .
It ’s working .
Of course this strategy is in combination with funding opposition groups and supporting disruption .
Many locals believe there are US - trained Colombian para- militants carrying out random killings in the country to help create a feeling of insecurity under Chavez rule .
The media tactics are clever and need no truth .
For example , un - named US officials will release a statement that Venezuela is supporting FARC rebels in Colombia , which receives headline treatment on the news .
A few days later a quiet press release is issued stating that actually they have no evidence of this , and of course the second release is deemed ‘ un - newsworthy ’ and the public are none the wiser .
A good example of this slanted international reporting is when Chavez moved to change the constitution to allow presidents to sit more than one term .
It was reported as the power hungry dictator not willing to let go of power and was international news .
Yet , Colombia tried to do the same and it did n’t make mainstream news .
It is also worth noting that most countries , including Australia , have a system where their leader can sit as many term as they like as long as they are democratically elected .
It was barely reported at all that the Chavez government actually proposed a more democratic system than we have by including the provision that as soon as a president is half way through their term anyone can call a referendum to expel them if they collect signatures of 20 per cent of the electorate .
This provision has already been used unsuccessfully by the opposition .
In the first few weeks of 2005 more than 50 articles were published in major US newspapers and programs shown on TV in the US about Venezuela , more than 85 per cent of the consulted “ experts ” quoted in these articles were connected to institutions or publications of the opposition . [ 1 ]
The USA also sanctioned Venezuela for not sufficiently supporting their war in Iraq in the form that no US companies could sell arms or military technology to Venezuela .
As such , Venezuela has been forced to look to other countries for military development , something the US now uses to argue that Venezuela is becoming a rogue state .
The US is also surrounding Venezuela militarily , increasing its presence in Brazil , Peru and the Caribbean , and establishing seven new bases in Colombia .
Many fear that Colombia is becoming ‘ an Israel of South America , ’ a place from which to wage war and control the area .
Things have worsened under the Obama presidency , which is not to blame Obama .
US international policy is state policy , not party policy , it matters little which party is governing .
Strategy may change but policy does n’t .
History shows policy has n’t changed for a couple centuries , a relative moderate like Kennedy was in office when Cuba was invaded as was Carter when the US waged war on the poor of Central America for a decade .
The only hope is that they have left it too late and the Chavez government is too popular , that enough people around the world realise most US international policy is based on lies and imperialist interests .
If global media undergoes a revolution of its own and begins to search for truth before headlines and advertising dollars , then this could offer a lifeline also .
So anyway , I began my time here with a head full of negative impressions and cynicism about the ‘ revolution ’ led by Chavez .
I had also been told that Caracas is “ the scariest place on earth ” and from another it was “ officially the worst city I ’ve ever been to . ”
I was expecting to find Caracas interesting , but not to like it .
The drive from the airport was spectacular , as we left the coast and wound up the steep valleys where the deep green dense jungle meets the multi-coloured barrios ( slums ) that somehow cling to the slopes like lichen to a cliff .
I was reminded of pictures I had seen in magazines .
The hillside barrios are so densely built and effectively home - made that they look as though if one dwelling toppled thousands would go with it .
In fact , a few years ago a landslide buried 20,000 people in this area and left hundreds of thousands homeless .
The barrios grow organically as people find some vacant land and begin to populate it .
Often these people are immigrants from countries such as Peru , Bolivia and Colombia seeking a better life .
Of Venezuela ’s 26 million inhabitants , four million are Colombians .
We had signed up for a ten day study tour organised by the Australia – Venezuela Solidarity Network , not because we are members , but because we saw it as an excellent way to learn as much as possible about the country in a short amount of time .
We met up with the rest of the group ; there were about fifteen of us .
I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity of the group , which included representatives of various Australian unions including the CFMEU and the MUA , a lawyer from Montreal , an Amnesty International employee , a high school teacher and a student and writer from Texas .
On the first night we also met an interesting French couple , the 82 year old Luis and his wife Anne .
Luis is a veteran of the French resistance in WWII and led a column of guerrillas under ‘ Che ’ in the Cuban revolution .
They also lived in San Salvador for four years during the Salvadoran civil war , working in the French embassy before it was abolished and sheltering children orphaned by the war .
Day two began with a lecture from Marcelo , a senior academic at the Central University in Caracas , on the history of Venezuela from the first known human inhabitation thousands of years ago , through the Spanish conquest up to the present .
The afternoon consisted of a free tour of the centre of Caracas complete with about 20 actors and 10 guides .
The free tours are part of Venezuela ’s bicentenary celebrations .
This year marks 200 years since Simon Bolivar liberated Venezuela from Spanish rule .
The tour was brilliant every time we walked 100 yards to another site there were actors waiting to portray the story .
The tour ended on the bridge that saw protesters shot during the 2002 coup .
Local media edited film of protesters who were shooting at opposition snipers , to make appear as though they were shooting at those who were actually victims of the snipers .
Of course these were the images CNN and Fox showed the world .
The next ‘ Postcard to TT ’ will explain more about the 2002 coup , the rise to power of Chavez and what the revolution actually means .
The next day we enjoyed a free classical concert of music from the 19th century related to the country ’s independence .
We saw Hotel Alba , which was the Hilton but has now been taken over by its workers .
There are beautiful murals everywhere in Caracas telling all sorts of stories .
In the afternoon we had a talk from an expert on the Venezuelan labour movement , including union movements , co-operatives and the reclamation of factories by workers .
A few things that stand out walking about Caracas are that utilisation of any free space , including under over - passes where I have seen public chess playing areas that have many tables complete with pieces .
There are also stalls everywhere selling books .
These book stalls often include small publications of individual national laws and the constitution .
Clothes shops also appear different as the mannequins are of all shapes and sizes , as opposed to back home in Australia where they tend to all be verging on anorexic .
Three days in and I love Caracas .
It has a brilliant buzz , it is different to any other city I have seen , there is colour everywhere and we have n’t had even the slightest negative experience …
Part II
For decades before the failed Chavez - led coup in 1992 Venezuela had a false democracy .
The false democracy was a two party system where the two parties were virtually identical and had an agreement to switch power each election ( every five years ) .
The agreement was known as the ‘ Punto Fijo Pact ’ .
This period followed one of several long dictatorships .
The seed for revolution had been planted long before Chavez .
Venezuela is a rich country , yet most of its people are poor .
There is a huge gap between rich and poor .
This is the strength of Chavez as he appears to represent the poor majority , in action as well as word .
It would be rare to find a rich Venezuelan who supports Chavez as those who hold the wealth rarely want it redistributed .
It has been in the interests of many internal power brokers and of the US for Venezuela to be completely oil dependent , which it now is .
This dependency ensures a steady flow of oil to the US and a need to import US goods ( Venezuela is the most ‘ Americanised ’ country I have been to , there are US goods everywhere ) .
The riches of the oil boom effectively killed off agriculture and other industries .
Chavez was leading part of a growing group within the army , known as the Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement ( MBR 200 ) who were disgusted by the corruption and abuse in the army and the government .
The 200 part of the name is due to the year the group formed being the 200th anniversary of the birth of Simon Bolivar .
In 1989 an IMF neo-liberal privatisation package caused an uprising known as “ Caracazo ” after the poor suburb it started in .
The package resulted in significantly greater costs for the poor , including the doubling of fuel prices overnight .
Presidential candidate Perez campaigned on the promise of not agreeing to the package and won .
His first action as President was to ratify the package .
This caused massive protests and Perez responded by ordering random massacres in the poor barrios .
Constitutional rights were suspended on an indefinite basis , human rights abuses became the norm and thousands were killed .
The MBR 200 group within the army refused to participate in the massacres .
It is worth noting that the Perez era was described by the US as a “ model democracy ” even during the violent crack downs and the polls that showed 84 per cent of the population were against the government .
These events increased the urgency for the MBR 200 group within the army , that and the fact that they believed they were close to being found out .
Chavez led a coup with MBR 200 against Perez , failed and was imprisoned .
Chavez was allowed to speak to the media to call off the coup and he did something almost unheard of in Venezuelan history .
Basically he said , “ I did it , this is why I did it , I failed and I take full responsibility for my actions . ”
People liked his honesty .
He also told his followers to lay down their weapons and that they would not win this way and then said the two words that became the two words that would be repeated throughout the barrios as a transmission of hope for change , “ por ahora ” ( for now ) .
He said , “ We have failed , for now . ”
The fuse Chavez lit with the words “ por ahora ” ignited hope particularly within Venezuela ’s poorer communities which continued to burn during his two years in prison .
He was eventually released due to public pressure .
After his release he quietly spent about four years travelling to basically every village in the country and talking to people in relatively impromptu meetings .
Grassroots support for Chavez grew rapidly and much to the surprise of the opposition Chavez won the election in 1998 .
The elections saw many who had never bothered to vote before turn out to have their say .
A US - backed coup to overthrow Chavez in 2002 succeeded for two days before civilian and army support for Chavez had him back in the presidency .
There is constant plotting against Chavez , but his empowerment of the disempowered seems to be keeping him in government .
His support for community councils and participatory democracy has involved thousands who were never politically represented before .
Voting is up significantly with stalls for electoral enrollment in every metro station and in many other public places , complete with electronic finger - printing .
The Chavez revolution is an experiment that is constantly evolving .
It is establishing structures which every year become less top - down .
The end goal is a socialist participatory democracy .
Who knows if it will work or if internal or external forces will allow us to see if it can , but for now it is undoubtedly improving life for the majority of Venezuelans and its progress should be of interest to people everywhere .
Our fourth day in Caracas was the day we tested the medical system of Venezuela from the inside .
Anna awoke with a brutal tooth ache and a molar that had all but turned black .
It seemed it may be something serious .
We had heard that Chavez had introduced free health care for all , but what would it be like ?
I have to admit I was thinking “ oh fuck , of all the places to have a medical emergency , why did it have to be Caracas ? ”
We found out where the closest ‘ Barrio Adentro ’ was and fortunately it was at the university in walking distance .
‘ Barrio Adentro ’ means something like ‘ within the neighbourhood ’ and is the system of having free health clinics in every area to ensure everyone has access to medical help .
Many of the doctors are Cuban , as Venezuela has a shortage of doctors ( well a shortage who are willing to live and work in the poor areas anyway ) .
Cuba and Venezuela have a deal where they swap oil for doctors .
We wandered in and found the dental section where they took our names and told us it would not be a long wait .
After about five minutes a dentist came in to the waiting room and gave a 20 minute Powerpoint presentation on dental problems and appropriate care .
From the presentation we both thought the problem may be an abscess under the tooth .
Five minutes later we were called in and discovered we had diagnosed it correctly .
After x-rays , drilling and much analysis the dentist decided it was a very bad abscess that extended below the tooth and we would be best with a specialist .
The two hours of help was free and we were referred to a specialist based at the Red Cross building in the city centre .
At the specialists we saw another dentist but unfortunately the specialist himself was n’t there .
They decided it was too bad and we should return to see the specialist the following day .
So Anna spent the night with more hole than tooth and we returned the next day .
To our dismay the specialist was seriously ill .
We were referred to a private clinic a couple hundred yards away where we were seen instantly by a brilliant dentist called Isabel , and so began six sessions of drilling , cleaning , root - canalling and rebuilding .
I am glad to say it all ended well and we feel very grateful that a couple foreigners should be treated so well and that what could have turned out as a ‘ fly home situation ’ ended up fine .
We have met a few people now who are anti-Chavez , including the dentist Isabel .
She describes him as “ crazy man . ”
However , the only reason we have been given so far as to why he is so bad is that it is very difficult to get hold of US Dollars in Venezuela at the moment making overseas travel very difficult due to the low value of the Bolivar .
The next day on our way to a meeting at BanMujer we passed a large vacant site in the city centre that is to be developed but not for another year or so .
As such , the government is paying a small cooperative of unemployed the minimum wage to grow vegetables on the site to be sold cheaply at the edge of the site .
It struck me as a great use of a couple hectares of temporarily useless land .
It got me thinking about the Myer site in Hobart .
BanMujer is a women ’s bank established by the Chavez government .
It provides low interest loans ( lower than current inflation ) to women in extreme poverty .
In fact the official interest rate is 19 % and the BanMujer rate is 6 % .
Small groups or families can receive loans of 5,000 bolivars ( $ 1,250 ) and cooperatives up to 50,000 bolivars ( $ 12,500 ) .
Approximately 50 per cent of the loans go to small scale agricultural projects .
Recipients have four years to pay off the loan and if they do so they are automatically entitled to another loan 50 per cent larger .
Projects and bank staff can involve men , but they must be run by women .
For example , a cooperative must have two women for every man and decisions must be taken by women .
Bank staff undertake assessments of the proposals of potential recipients and of reasons why recipients have not made their payments .
If they find that payments have not been made due to external factors rather than the negligence of the recipient (s ) an assistance plan is provided .
The bank provided other benefits in addition to a financial leg - up .
Project candidates have to do their own economic feasibility studies ( with guidance ) and the bank provides training and education , in areas such as running cooperatives , accounting , women ’s health , sexual education and women ’s medicine .
Due to another couple hours at the dentist we arrived late for the meeting at the Indigenous Parliament of Latin America with one of Venezuela ’s three representatives Yuis Aray .
We were there long enough to catch some interesting points .
She believes that the Chavez government has greatly improved the recognition of the country ’s indigenous peoples , thought to be only a few per cent at most unlike Ecuador , Peru or Bolivia to the south , which have high percentages of indigenous .
She explained that in the past few years , history and school book have stopped referring to the indigenous in the past tense and now more appropriately use the present .
How strange it must have been reading about your people as if they no longer existed .
Yuis described some of the old beliefs of the Venezuelan indigenous , which set the imagination ablaze .
They believed that everything could talk - the plants , animals , rocks and rivers .
As such , every word was spiritual as everything else in the world could hear that word .
Everything within Pachamama ( Mother Earth ) is linked and every word has meaning .
So every word is a deep commitment as everything within Mother Earth will respond to those words .
Part III
Next we headed on an overnight bus to Puerto Ordaz in the east , which is basically the industrial heart of Venezuela .
It is a huge , like Bell Bay multiplied by a hundred .
Even though it did n’t drop under 30 degrees during our time in Venezuela the long distance buses keep an internal temperature of around minus 30 .
We arrived at the station at about 8 am only to find the buses we had booked to drive us around for two days unavailable due to strikes over annual bonuses .
Anna was happy that we had to catch a taxi to our first destination mainly because the taxi driver was playing some prime 80s tunes mixed to a catchy techno beat and thus the car became a party for a short time .
We visited a ceramic brick factory that has been reclaimed by the workers .
It is a couple months away from resuming production after sabotage by the owners .
The motivation of the workers to make the factory work as a cooperative in partnership with the government was impressive .
On the way back to the hotel we visited an area of vacant land claimed by several hundred landless families .
They were having their weekly community meetings when we arrived unannounced and as such we did n’t have very long talking with them .
The area of land had been private land .
When they moved in the owner appeared and starting trying to charge them rent , which no one paid .
The owner then complained to the authorities , who investigated the case and found the owner had n’t been paying land tax for over a decade and decided the land therefore was n’t his .
The land now belongs to the community .
The living conditions are very basic , some are still living in tents , but the community is new and is organising .
As they organise they are able to improve the area and gain governmental assistance .
We saw a similar community nearby that was older where the government has now built the residents proper dwellings and installed services .
This is the aim for the new community .
All the people we spoke to were passionate Chavez supporters who believe for the first time their interests are a concern of their government and their leader .
Just outside Puerto Ordaz is a huge nature reserve , which contains several large waterfalls , beautiful forest and wild monkeys .
The water that feeds the waterfalls comes from a huge hydroelectric scheme that supplies a whopping 68 per cent of Venezuela ’s electricity .
Severe drought over the past year or so is causing electricity shortages throughout the country .
Back in Caracas we wandered about ‘ Barrio Veinte Tres de Enero ’ ( Neighbourhood January 23 ) with a community leader and spoke to locals about their organisation through community councils and the general progress in the area .
This area has been well organised as a community since long before Chavez and was an important area in past uprisings .
The 56 buildings that make up the Barrio were built in the fifties to house the army under the dictatorship of Marcos Perez Jimenez .
In 1959 there was a general uprising against the Jimenez , partly organised by a naval admiral but also by many left - wing organisations and the Communist party of Venezuela ( PCV ) .
Jimenez was overthrown and apparently fled the country in such a hurry he left suitcases full of Treasury money on the runway .
He lived out his days in luxury in Spain .
With the overthrow of Jimenez poor people invaded these new buildings as construction had just finished .
The locals say that the keys were all hanging on a wall so each family grabbed a key and kept trying doors until the key worked .
The name of the barrio was initially ‘ 12th December , ’ marking the date construction of the buildings finished .
However , the community renamed it ‘ 23 January ’ to celebrate the date of the overthrow of the dictator , Perez Jimenez .
On May Day we marched and partied with several hundred thousand others for several kilometres through the heart of Caracas .
The atmosphere was amazing , as the river of red t- shirts flooded through the city overflowing with song , goodwill and hope .
There were rumours that Chavez was coming , but it turned out he was in another country at a conference at the time .
On the last morning of the organised part of the trip we had a talk by , and discussions with , Eva Golinger who has written several books on Venezuela , particularly US interference .
Eva is a Venezuelan - American attorney who has spent years obtaining top - secret documents from the CIA , State Department and other departments under the Freedom of Information Act .
The documents leave no doubt regarding US support for the 2002 coup against Chavez and their continuing financial and logistical support for various anti-Chavez movements and media outlets .
Her books include the The Chavez Code and Bush versus Chavez .
It was fascinating and depressing to hear factual accounts of the depth of US involvement in Venezuela and other countries in the region .
I left the discussion almost without hope for Latin America , with the feeling that if any government tries to act for its own people , to improve the life of its poor or to regulate multinationals socially and environmentally , they would likely only last a few years before the US managed to orchestrate their downfall .
This is exactly what has happened in almost every Latin American country over the last century , for example in Nicaragua , Guatemala , El Salvador , Colombia , Brazil and the list goes on .
Yet , this is why Venezuela is so interesting .
It has survived the interference longer than is historically normal .
Needless to say Eva receives regular death threats , for the crime of revealing truth .
In the afternoon we took a detoxification from depressing information and caught the cable car up Pico el Avila .
Caracas flows along a deep valley with mountains of approximately 2000 m in height .
This is one of those mountains , covered in dense dark green forest , which must afford the city some oxygen amongst the carbon monoxide .
Seeing over the other side was a pleasant surprise , it slopes steeply downward past small indigenous agricultural plots to the turquoise ocean , which I had n’t realised we were so close to .
With a few days left we bussed up and down tiny winding roads to Colonia Tovar , which is , of all things , a German village in the middle of Venezuela .
It was founded in the early 19th century and it was only in the 1940 ’s that Spanish became the official language and marriage outside the community was permitted .
It was a surreal place and it did feel a bit wrong being in such a place when in Venezuela , but we climbed a nearby mountain and the forest was stunning , like rainforest but with tall palms interspersed through it .
Our time in Venezuela finished with a taxi ride of death .
The trip was an hour and a half and was almost entirely on tiny roads with no barriers and ravines hundreds of metres deep off the edge .
Our driver seemed to be trying for a record time and we were getting thrown around so much that our seatbelts were locked almost the entire journey .
In addition , my bladder was close to bursting point and I could n’t remember how to say piss in Spanish and for some reason was embarrassed to use the word urinate .
I guess I just imagined someone in Australia saying , “ Excuse me , I need to urinate . ”
After several painful minutes I solved the internal crisis , managing to find the words for “ I need a tree to go behind . ”
I arrived in Venezuela with a fair amount of cynicism but with a desire to hear the other side of the story , that is to say the pro-Chavez , pro-revolution , pro-socialism side .
I leave Venezuela unsure if the Bolivarian experiment can work , though impressed by what I have seen of it .
Hoping the experiment will be allowed to plot its own course by the US , Europe and large corporate interests in particular , is pointless .
Venezuela will not be left alone .
I only hope they fail in their interference and in the process awaken more citizens of the world to the true motivations behind trying to stop a democratic nation ’s shift to a more socialist society .
The world should watch Venezuela with interest , and in my opinion , with hope .
Simply because the capitalist liberal - democracy that dominates our world promotes inequality and is unsustainable .
If another way is or is n’t possible it may become a life - line or a lesson to all of us .

Here 's a story from Australia this morning that describes a credit - card scam that has bilked 3,500 McDonald 's customers out of some $ 2.5 million .
Although the story is from a credible news source , do not ask me to vouch for its authenticity ... or to even believe it .
That 's because I 'm not in my believing place right now , having just digested this other McDonald 's - related story from Australia about how that country 's David Thorne -- already " famous " for trying to pay a bill with a drawing of a seven - legged spider -- has copped to pulling another one over on the Internet two weeks ago .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
From the second story :
A FAKE memo claiming McDonald 's stores deliberately rip off customers has been revealed to be the work of the same prankster behind an infamous e-mail about a seven - legged spider .
The document , mocked - up with an official McDonald 's Australia letterhead and signed by fictitious managing director " Robert Trugabe " , outlines a secret plan to save money by leaving items out of drive - through orders .
" If the girls leave one item out of every second or third order , this adds up to several thousand dollars per week revenue , " it says .
The memo is a fake -- " Robert Trugabe " is a play on the name of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and the memo 's signature was Mugabe 's copied from Wikipedia -- yet that did n't stop " outrage " spreading through the blogosphere via such mainstream sites as The Consumerist and Reddit .
Both of those sites , to their credit , were among those quick to call shenanigans -- in Reddit 's case , literally -- but the " story " was out there and you can be certain it will live on as truth in the minds of many .
McDonald 's had to go so far as to place a denial on its homepage in Australia .
As hoaxer Thorne put it to the Aussie media : " The fastest and easiest way to feed anything , true or stupid , to the Internet machine is through Reddit . "
Or through any number of similar sites , if we want to be fair ; after all , that much ballyhooed wisdom of the crowds is often blunted by gullibility .
And here 's the worst part , at least for me , a working journalist :
It 's only a matter of time before I fall for one of these things myself , much as TechCrunch did recently at the hands of the Facebook 's merry pranksters .
Suffering this fate is a real fear of mine , not that I - might - lose - my - job - today kind of real , but more bothersome than say the fear of spiders .
Oh , that story about the credit - card scam targeting McDonald 's customers ?
I do really believe it , so you Aussies might want to consider Burger King in the short run .

Vancouver is among the least affordable housing markets in the world , according to a report by the Frontier Centre for Public Policy .

Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners Hurrah !
Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
That hardly comes as news to Vancouver families trapped between rents they can barely afford and the increasingly unobtainable dream of home ownership .
What appears to have been forgotten among the near - daily headlines about systematic renovictions and spiraling house prices is that for much of the last century , a third form of housing tenure frequently filled the gap between ownership and rental .
It 's called co-operative housing .
More than 90,000 such homes were developed during the mid-20th century .
But outside of Quebec , almost none are being built today .
As part of an ongoing exploration of affordable housing alternatives , The Tyee and The Tyee Solutions Society invited a panel of co-op housing experts to discuss the question : Could co-op housing be reinvented for the 21st century ?
Over the next few days , The Tyee will present some of the intriguing ideas that emerged from that wide - ranging discussion .
But first , here 's an overview of the problem , how co-ops work , and an introduction to our panel of experts .
World 's least affordable homes
Here are the facts leading to the inescapable conclusion that there is no longer any corner of Vancouver where a working - class family can afford a home .
A median Vancouver household earns about $ 64,000 a year , according to Statistics Canada .
A typical bank will loan that working family somewhere in the range of $ 260,000 toward the purchase of a primary residence .
A detached bungalow on the West Side costs an average of $ 1.15 million , according to a 2010 survey by Royal LePage .
That 's more than four times what a median working family can afford .
A West Side condo costs $ 725,000 , according to the survey .
That 's almost three times what a working family can afford .
A detached home on the East Side costs $ 674,000 .
That 's more than twice what a family can afford .
And an East Side condo costs $ 402,000 , or about one and a half times what a family can afford .
Put another way , a typical Vancouver family would have to save $ 140,000 in order to make a down payment on an entry - level home .
Since few working families are capable of saving that kind of cash , most remain trapped in the rental market .
And with so few households exiting the rental market over the past few years , Vancouver rents have begun to skyrocket -- especially for multi-bedroom homes .
An average three - bedroom apartment in the West End now fetches $ 2,589 a month , according to a recent Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp survey .
Co-ops once filled the gap
Until about two decades ago , co-operative housing filled much of the gap between home ownership and rental .
A housing co-operative -- or " co-op " -- is a multi- unit property owned by its residents .
But unlike a condominium , where owners hold stratified titles to individual units , co-op residents are shareholders in a legal entity that owns the building .
The shareholders are called members , and the holding company is called a co-operative association .
Each member also holds occupancy rights to a specific suite .
There are several types of co-operative associations .
Market rate co-ops function much like condominiums : the share price of a market rate co-op rises or falls on the open market .
Though common among Northern European cities that share Vancouver - style affordability problems , market rate co-ops are relatively rare in Canada .
Limited equity co-ops have rules that limit share prices in an attempt to maintain affordability .
Limited equity co-ops offer most of the privileges of ownership -- including the monthly savings realized once the mortgage is repaid -- but not the right to make capital gains in a rising market .
No-equity co-ops provide some of the privileges of ownership -- such as secure tenure and protection against market - driven rental increases -- but function more like rental apartments .
There is a very low purchase price -- comparable to a rental security deposit -- and a monthly fee paid in lieu of rent .
Federal and provincial governments encouraged the construction of limited equity and no-equity co-ops throughout the 1970s and 1980s via an evolving series of funding programs .
The legacy of those programs remains : there are 91,890 units in 2,221 co-operative associations across the nation , according to the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada .
British Columbia is home to 14,698 units in 264 co-operatives .
Much of that financial support was contingent on the provision of some units ( often between 15 and 20 per cent ) to low - income residents .
As a result , most co-ops are mixed - income communities .
At the same time , these requirements also led many Canadians to confuse co-ops with social housing .
Could co-ops be reinvented ?
Federal and provincial ( except in Quebec ) support for co-ops died in the 1990s , and most developers turned their attentions to the increasingly lucrative condo market .
The co-op federation estimates that outside of Quebec , no more than 300 new co-op units have been created in the past decade .
As part of its ongoing exploration of affordable housing options , The Tyee and its sister organization , the Tyee Solutions Society , convened a daylong discussion among nine co-op experts .
The participants included :
Stewart Anderson , manager of Aboriginal Banking , Vancity Community Investment Division ;
Thom Armstrong , executive director of the Co-op Housing Federation of B.C. ;
Nicholas Gazzard , executive director of the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada ;
Cameron Gray , recently retired as managing director of the Department of Social Development at the City of Vancouver ;
Darren Kitchen , government relations director of the Co-op Housing Federation of B.C. ;
Catherine Ludgate , manager of Social Finance at Vancity Capital ;
Jim O'Dea , a principal of Terra Housing Consultants ;
Catherine Porter , president of the board of directors of the Co-op Housing Federation of B.C. ;
Tim Pringle , director of special projects for the Real Estate Foundation of B.C. ; and
Stuart Thomas , a principal of Terra Housing Consultants .
The Tyee asked the group a relatively simple question : Could co-operative housing be reinvented for the 21st century ?
There was no simple answer , of course , but the wide - ranging discussion produced several intriguing ideas .
Over the next few days , we 'll present three of those ideas :
The invention of a shared - equity ownership model , the reallocation of existing government funding , and the reconstitution of hundreds of tiny co-operatives into larger associations .
' The payback is downstream '
Here 's what a few of the panelists had to say about the current state of co-op housing .
Darren Kitchen described the role co-ops have played this way :
" I think co-ops are important because I think there 's a real lack of choice in terms of housing tenure that people can access .
Not everyone can afford -- most people can't afford -- a condominium or single family home , and renting is inherently insecure and not prone to building any kind of stability in people 's lives , " Kitchen said .
" And I think , between those two extremes , a model that provides ownership , responsibility , community and vitally , security of tenure , is an important piece in ensuring people have access to a variety of choices of tenure rather than the two that we seem to have been stuck in for the past 20 years , " Kitchen added .
City Hall veteran Cameron Gray recalled that co-ops were viewed differently before the condo boom .
" This was seen as affordable home ownership .
Even though it was a rental model -- no equity -- it was seen as a home ownership structure in the sense that once the mortgage was paid off the members benefited from it just like anyone with a house , " Gray said .
Jim O'Dea said public misperception has hobbled co-op development .
" I think the biggest problem that co-ops have always had -- and sometimes the press is to blame for this , by the way -- is that most people do n't understand the community concept .
They do n't understand the difference between equity co-ops and non-profit co-ops ... they mash them all together , " O'Dea said .
" People do n't understand the mix of populations , mix of economic conditions , " O'Dea continued .
" When I moved into a co-op back in 1980 , I got on the front page of the Vancouver Sun .
They questioned why should I be in a co-op because I was a high - income earner . "
Thom Armstrong made a case that the cultural advantages were as valuable as the economic incentives .
" I think co-ops are important to talk about because it's a rare intersection between individual empowerment and collective equity .
And there 's not a lot of opportunities to experience that intersection in a way that builds the kind of communities that you can build with housing co-ops .
But I also think they can be the catalyst for other forms of cooperation and community economic development .
And that 's something that as a movement perhaps we have n't explored as fully as we could have , " Armstrong said .
And Nicholas Gazzard , who flew from Ottawa to join the discussion , was among the first to point a finger toward government .
" The reason we have n't seen housing co-ops develop in the last , say 15 years , is n't because they 're culturally passé , but because the economic and policy environment has n't favored their development as part of an affordable housing strategy , " Gazzard said .
" It 's been much easier for government to simply go to non-profit providers and developers and say , ' Here 's some money , bring some assets to the table up - front . '
That 's what we 're looking for , easy , simple , out of the box .
Co-ops are not that simple .
The payback is downstream , not upfront . "

Conditions favorable to life may once have existed all over Mars , the European Space Agency said Friday .
Two spacecraft have found evidence that liquid water was widespread over the red planet .
The ESA 's Mars Express and NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have discovered hydrated silicate minerals in the northern lowlands of Mars , a clear indication that water once flowed there , the ESA said .
The two spacecraft had previously found thousands of small outcrops in the planet 's southern hemisphere where rock minerals had been altered by water , it said .
Many of these outcrops are in the form of hydrated clay minerals known as phyllosilicates .
They indicate the planet 's southern hemisphere was once much warmer and wetter than it is today .
No such sites had been found in the northern lowlands until this week , the ESA said .
The northern lowlands are covered in thick blankets of lava and sediments up to several kilometers thick and that had hampered efforts to probe what lay beneath .
The ESA 's Mars Express found the first hints of water in the northern plains , but the outcrops were small and more detailed observations were needed to confirm the evidence , the ESA said .
NASA 's Orbiter provided higher resolution data that showed at least nine northern craters with phyllosilicates or other hydrated silicates , the ESA said .
The finding was reported this week in the journal Science .
Those minerals formed in wet environments and were identical to those found in the southern hemisphere .
" We can now say that the planet was altered on a global scale by liquid water more than 4 billion years ago , " said the report 's lead author , John Carter of the University of Paris .
Scientists said it 's difficult to draw conclusions about the type of environment that existed on Mars when it had water , but they do have some clues .
The sites " are rich in iron and magnesium , but less in aluminum .
Together with the close proximity of olivine , which is easily modified by water , this indicates that the exposure to water lasted only tens to hundreds of millions of years , " said Jean - Pierre Bibring , the OMEGA principal investigator from the University of Paris .
The scientists ' search concentrated on 91 sizeable craters where incoming asteroids have punched down the planet 's surface by several kilometers , exposing " ancient crustal material , " the ESA said .
The results could also suggest sites for future Mars landers , because evidence of water during the planet 's early history suggests conditions in those spots may have been favorable to the evolution of primitive life , the ESA said .

So here 's your chance .
Choose , but choose wisely : future generations will mock you if you screw this up .
( CNN ) --
As oil continues to pour into the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion , comfort may come from an unusual direction : the largest oil spill in history .
Between five and 10 million barrels of oil poured into the Persian Gulf in 1991 when Iraqi troops , retreating from their occupation of Kuwait , set fire to desert oil wells and opened the valves on oil rigs and pipelines .
The spill -- at least five times the most recent estimate of that spilled in the Gulf of Mexico -- devastated marine wildlife and coastal habitats in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia .
Yet , against all the odds , the Persian Gulf appears to have shown amazing resilience in response to the ecological disaster .
Nicolas Pilcher is a marine specialist with the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
He was in neighboring Saudi Arabia as oil began washing ashore on the beaches .
It had flowed south along the coast from Kuwait .
" It was huge , " Pilcher told CNN .
" It 's hard to describe for people who were n't there but it was basically a coast of black . "
By the time Saudi authorities and international contractors initiated clean - up efforts , pumping oil from the sea into holding areas , much of the oil had sunk , evaporated or washed up on beaches , according to Pilcher .
" You would see oil on the beach or along the shoreline in the water , but it was n't there for more than about a month , " he said .
But oil slicks had an immediate and catastrophic impact on local wildlife .
Christophe Tourenq , science and research manager at the World Wildlife Fund 's UAE office told CNN that researchers estimate 30,000 water birds were killed by the oil .
Fish eggs and larvae were killed by slicks , which in turn reduced the breeding success of some bird species by 50 percent in the year after the spill , he said .
More on oil spills : Read about Spain 's ' Coast of Death '
But , according to researchers , in the years following the spill the Gulf 's ecosystem began to make a remarkable comeback .
A 2008 joint German - Saudi research paper on the effects of oil pollution in the Persian Gulf stated that by 1994 , fish and bird populations had returned to pre-spill levels .
Whale , dolphin and turtle populations were largely unaffected , according to the same study .
The fishing industry was decimated after the oil spill and Iraqi mines made the Gulf a no - go area for Kuwaiti and Saudi fishermen .
But , it too , had started to show signs of improvement by 1994 , the same study shows , and is widely considered to have made a full recovery from the after effects of the spill today .
" What they found , and they 've found in other places in the world , is that nature does recover , " said Pilcher .
Although a colossal amount of oil was released into the Gulf , Pilcher said up to half may have simply disappeared from the water by a combination of evaporation and degradation by bacteria in the sea .
In the Persian Gulf , the local climate -- very hot and humid for most of the year -- would have helped .
Abdul Nabi Al - Ghadban of Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research has studied the impact of the spill .
He told CNN : " If you have a higher air / water temperature the lighter fraction of the oil , which is more toxic , evaporates , and the heavy fraction , which is least toxic , goes to the bottom . "
" That 's why with an incident like the Exxon Valdez , although in terms of volume it was far less than the spill in the Arabian Gulf , in that part of the world , because of the colder water the impact can be stronger .
" The lighter fraction stays there for a longer period and can inflict a lot of damage compared with hot areas . "
Nonetheless , the oil spill has left the Gulf with some scars that have not yet healed .
Ghadban said coral reefs have been damaged , particularly off the coast of Saudi Arabia .
And the heavier oil fractions , which do n't evaporate or dissolve , have sunk into coastal sediments .
A 2003 U.S. study found huge quantities of oil in the sediment of salt marshes , mudflats and mangroves on the coast of Saudi Arabia .
Laila Hayat , of Kuwaiti activists Green Line Environmental Group , told CNN she feared that oil buried in beach sands could be released by the erosive action of coastal currents .
It 's a fear shared by Ghadban , who said studies are being carried out to test the likelihood of that occurring .
So , can any lessons from the Persian Gulf spill be applied to the ongoing Gulf of Mexico spill ?
According to the latest U.S. government estimates , up to 855,000 barrels of oil have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico since a 5,000 - foot - deep well erupted after an explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20 .
Gulf Coast Oil Spill
" There are probably similarities [ between the spills ] , although it 's too early to tell , " said Pilcher .
" One issue in the Gulf of Mexico is the sunken oil -- whether that ever makes it up on the surface and on the shores , or will it just sink to the bottom .
" In terms of the clean up , I think some coastal habitats are just way too fragile to be touched .
" Some of those coastal marshes will probably be more damaged by clean - up activities than they would be if they were left to deal with the disaster on their own . "
For Ghadban , the lessons from the 1991 oil spill are all too relevant to the Gulf of Mexico spill .
" If you have an offshore operation you need to have a good contingency plan in case of spillage , damage , earthquake , or a problem with the pipeline .
" We learned the lesson that we have to have an action plan -- you have to expect the unexpected . "
Israel ’s disastrous raid in international waters Monday on a Turkish - flagged flotilla carrying humanitarian supplies to Gaza has resurrected a long - running debate over whether Washington ’s close alliance with the Jewish state really serves U.S. strategic interests .
Ironically , one negative answer was provided in Jerusalem Tuesday by none other than the head of Israel ’s vaunted foreign - intelligence agency , Mossad .
Noting , among other things , the disappearance of the Soviet and Western blocs with the end of the Cold War , Mossad chief Meir Dagan told members of the Israeli parliament ’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Tuesday that " Israel is gradually turning from an asset to the United States to a burden . "
That view was emphatically re-asserted the following day by one of Washington ’s most highly respected and centrist Middle East analysts in an essay entitled " Israel as a Strategic Liability ? " that instantly became must - reading for regional specialists both in and outside the administration of President Barack Obama .
" At the best of times , an Israeli government that pursues the path to peace provides some intelligence , some minor advances in military technology , and a potential source of stabilizing military power that could help Arab states like Jordan , " wrote Anthony Cordesman , a long - time fixture of the foreign policy establishment at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) .
" It is time Israel realized that it has obligations to the United States , as well as the United States to Israel , and that it ( has to ) become far more careful about the extent to which it test ( s ) the limits of U.S. patience and exploits the support of American Jews , " he went on , noting the Israeli government " should be sensitive to the fact that its actions directly affect U.S. strategic interests in the Arab and Muslim worlds … "
" This does not mean taking a single action that undercuts Israeli security , but it does mean realizing that Israel should show enough discretion to reflect the fact that it is a tertiary U.S. strategic interest in a complex and demanding world , " he wrote .
" Israel ’s government should act on the understanding that the long - term nature of the U.S. - Israel strategic relationship will depend on Israel clearly and actively seeking peace with the Palestinians – the kind of peace that is in Israel ’s own strategic interests , " he added .
Cordesman ’s observations were not new .
Indeed , some variant of them have been expressed with increasing frequency by a growing number of mainstream analysts over the last four years , particularly since the tactically successful but strategically disastrous military campaigns conducted by Israel in Lebanon in 2006 and in Gaza 2008 - 9 .
But the fact that Cordesman , a former national security adviser to the staunchly pro-Israel 2008 Republican presidential candidate , Sen .
John McCain , felt moved to write so bluntly about the issue in the immediate aftermath of the lethal Israeli raid on Mavi Marmara suggests that the tide of elite opinion regarding the value of virtually unconditional support for Israel — especially for a government as aggressive as that of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu — is turning .
" Tony Cordesman ’s authority derives as much from the fact that he is resolutely dispassionate and non-partisan as it does from his expertise , which is unmatched , " said Amb .
Charles Freeman , a top - ranked retired diplomat who renounced his appointment last year to chair the National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) in the face of intense opposition by the right - wing leadership of the so - called " Israel Lobby . "
" When someone as balanced and centrist as Tony Cordesman begins to worry about the extent to which Israel is making itself into a strategic burden for the United States , Israel should pause for some self - reflection , " Freeman told IPS .
Stephen Walt , a Harvard international - relations professor and co-author with University of Chicago Prof .
John Mearsheimer of the controversial 2007 book , The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , agreed .
" The fact that Cordesman would say this publicly is a sign that attitudes and discourse are changing , " he said .
" Lots of people in the national security establishment — and especially the Pentagon and intelligence services — have understood that Israel was n’t an asset , but nobody wanted to say so because they knew it might hurt their careers . "
" It will be interesting to see how Cordesman is treated in the future , and whether more people will be inclined to say what they really think , " he added .
The notion that Israel and its actions had since the Cold War increasingly become a " strategic liability " to U.S. interests in the region was a central thesis of Walt ’s and Mearsheimer ’s book , which came under immediate and sustained attack by the right - wing leadership of the Jewish and Christian Zionist communities .
The book itself was based on an article by the same name that the two men published in the London Review of Books in 2006 after a number of influential U.S. periodicals rejected it , apparently due to concerns that it was too controversial .
Yet , in the wake of the Lebanon and Gaza military offensives , the election of Netanyahu ’s right - wing government and its resistance to the kind of two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict favored by successive U.S. administration , the question of Israel ’s strategic value has become increasingly pertinent .
Already on the eve of Obama ’s inauguration , the influential National Journal ran a symposium on the question : " Is Israel a Strategic Liability for the United States ? " in which a surprising number of respected national security analysts answered in the affirmative .
When the Netanyahu government announced new Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden in March , the issue re-surfaced with a vengeance .
Biden himself was reported by the Israeli press as telling Netanyahu that such provocations endangered the lives of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A few weeks later , the chief of the U.S. Central Command ( CentCom ) , Gen. David Petraeus , warned lawmakers that " perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel … foments anti- American sentiment " throughout the region and had an " enormous effect " on " the strategic context in which we operate . "
The beneficiaries , he said , include Iran , al - Qaeda , and other radical Islamist groups .
In his essay , Cordesman insisted that Washington ’s commitment to Israel , which he identified as largely " moral and ethical " given their shared democratic values and the legacy of the Nazi Holocaust , " is not one that will be abandoned . "
" At the same time , " he went on , " the depth of America ’s moral commitment does not … mean that the United States should extend support to an Israeli government when that government fails to credibly pursue peace with its neighbors . "
" … It does not mean that the United States should be passive when Israel makes a series of major blunders — such as persisting in the strategic bombing of Lebanon during the Israeli - Hezbollah conflict , escalating its attack on Gaza long after it had achieved its key objectives , embarrassing the U.S. president by announcing the expansion of Israeli building programs in East Jerusalem at a critical moment in U.S. efforts to put Israeli - Palestinian peace talks back on track , or sending commandos to seize a Turkish ship in a horribly mismanaged effort to halt the ‘ peace flotilla ’ going to Gaza , " he wrote .
( Inter Press Service )
When I was a little girl , like most little girls , I used to love to draw a house with smoke that whirled out the chimney like telephone cord and a triangular - skirted mummy with her husband and two children .
I saw her as the ' me ' of the future .
A blueprint for life .
And I did n't much change that view until a few years ago , when I realised not everything works out like wax - crayon dreams .
Sure , at 43 , I have the home , and there 's often been a man in the picture , but as for children , there are none .
Not because I ever had to face learning I was infertile .
Neither did I postpone pregnancy to concentrate on a career , only to thud back down to earth on finding the egg - timer had run dry .
It 's just that while navigating my way through the thoroughly modern maze of serial monogamy , with all its deceptive bends and dead ends , I never reached the let 's - make - babies stage with anyone .
Not even when I was married - a brief , precarious union in which it seemed unwise to use parenthood as Polyfilla .
As for other long - term relationships , the men I loved were n't ready for babies .
And never would I have got pregnant ' accidentally ' .
For me , that seemed an utterly joyless option .
Nor was it in my nature to nag a man into nappydom .
Even now , when I watch the sketch show Spoons , and that guy asks his girlfriend , ' Do you want a lager / lunch / lift to work ? ' and she screams , ' No , I want a fucking baby , ' I positively cower .
And hit the mute button .
Maybe it 's because she sounds so aggressive , so raw .
Or maybe it 's because she screeches the words I rarely so much as whispered .
I suppose I did n't dump ditherers because I was n't a strategist .
I simply saw baby love as something that , if you were fortunate , grew out of romantic love ( which is why planning to have a child solo was , for me , always a non-starter ) .
Perhaps too , while I wanted to rock the cradle , I simply was n't confident enough to rock the boat .
Fearful of swapping a love - in for a break - up , I hung on in there , hoping things would change .
They never did .
And because that journey featured no ultimatum - filled arguments , no medica l procedures , no miscarriages and no mourning , it lacked a degree of drama .
Thus , it became an impalpable , unacknowledged sadness .
What a contributor to the book Beyond Childlessness ( Rodale , £ 13 ) aptly christened ' a creeping non-choice ' .
Which is why I wonder if it 's ever legitimate to seek sympathy , merely because my baby - making possibilities came to nothing .
' Of course it is , because it 's actually a very big something , ' says Liz Scott , fertility counsellor at the Assisted Conception Unit of the Lister Hospital .
' Many people are secretly carrying around a lot of grief about childlessness because whatever the cause - whether they never met the right man or perhaps IVF did n't succeed - it still comes down to the same thing ... the loss of a dream child .
And while most people recognise the grieving process when it comes to other life events - the death of a loved one or the loss of a home , even a career - society does n't offer the same kind of support in these cases , and it can be a very insular , isolating process . '
Certainly these days , reasons for involuntary childlessness are many and varied .
Whereas years ago , a diagnosis of infertility was accompanied by the slamming shut of a heavy door , now , with so many treatments and options available , that door is left ajar and a shaft of light shines through .
But procedures are n't always successful .
IVF can fail .
Raised hopes can turn to razed dreams .
Others stories of childlessness are shaped by circumstance .
I know a woman who met someone who already had children .
He did n't want more and the question of whether to leave him in the hope of finding a partner who did , was complicated by her age - at 35 , would she be happier staying put and accepting childlessness rather than risking loneliness ?
Another friend starting seeing a divorcé who , although he had children , was n't averse to having more , but had already had a vasectomy .
She wondered when would be the right time to ask if he'd ever consider a reversal ?
Before they got serious ?
After ?
Would it even work ?
Yet while there are many reasons why you might not have a ' Baby on Board ' sticker slapped in your rear window ( sometimes those things really do seem like a badge of honour ) , still , I find people make snap judgments .
You 're either pitied ( poor thing , she must have dodgy ovaries ) or judged ( there 's more to life than sports cars and spas ) .
In my case , as a journalist and shoe - junkie , it 's usually assumed I have both expensively shod feet in the careerist camp , when in fact , with no family in the frame , it just seemed sensible to work in a creatively fulfilling job and pay off my mortgage .
There have been times when dealing with childlessness has hit home harder , often in the most seemingly inconsequential of moments .
Like when someone wants to play the if - you - show - me - your - kiddie - snaps - I 'll - show - you - mine game .
When you tell them that unfortunately , things did n't work out that way , jokiness often ensues .
Then , swiftly , it 's dismissed .
Perhaps they do n't understand , having never walked in my Jimmy Choos .
Perhaps they understand only too well - a world without those sunbeam faces on that clutched snapshot is not one they care to contemplate .
And as is so often the case with things we dislike confronting , we ignore it .
However , it 's hardly an uncommon experience .
According to a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) , when women in their early twenties were interviewed between 1982 - 84 , five per cent said they did n't want children , yet four times as many were childless by their late thirties - that 's one in five women born in the baby boom , a rate of childlessness double that of their mothers .
What 's more , it 's projected that almost one quarter of women born in 1973 will be childless by the age of 45 .
But as Rachel Black , co-author with Louise Scull of Beyond Childlessness , which explores the reflections of over 200 women 's experiences of involuntary childlessness , says , ' Before writing the book , I felt society 's and the media 's silence contributed to my own sense of alienation and isolation surrounding childlessness .
It 's not a subject that lends itself well to " 10 ways to solve your problem " type boxes because it goes to the very core of what it means to be a woman and no handy hints can resolve what , for many , takes years of work to reach a point where it feels OK .
' You do n't hear many high - profile women discuss it either , ' she continues .
' With the notable exceptions of Anthea Turner , Dillie Keane and author Hilary Mantel , I do n't know of any others who have " come out " .
Yet celebrities seem to talk openly about children they 've adopted .
Somehow , this perpetuates the idea that involuntary childlessness is about failure .
Something to be kept under wraps .
A deadly secret .
We need to break through the wall of silence .'
Recently , I felt compelled to try , and wrote a piece for Vogue about childlessness as a product of misaligned life moments .
It was like dropping a stone in a glassy pond .
Ripples spread out .
Emails poured in .
People passed it on to friends , who passed it on to friends abroad .
I was inundated with messages saying thanks for being brave enough to talk about it .
And while I have no wish to become the flag - bearer for the non-mothers union , I 'm happy if it helps to start unravelling knots of pain .
' I 've always wanted to tell people that I had n't chosen to be childless , ' said one woman , ' Yet I 've felt I could n't voice it .
By being open , you 've made it more socially acceptable . '
How sad that she felt it 's been such a taboo .
That said , currently the subject is being aired largely because some high - level number - crunching has been going down .
The IPPR has suggested a demographic crisis could be on the horizon , with too few babies being born to support an ageing population .
Secret agonies , it seems , could turn into a government problem .
One of the reasons cited for many women delaying conception and so having fewer babies , or no children at all , is that young mothers suffer a ' fertility penalty ' and end up earning considerably less than their childless counterparts , which is the reason the IPPR is calling for greater family - friendly entitlements and more state - supported childcare .
Personally , I think the changing nature of relationships has played a huge part , too .
I know plenty of 30 - somethings who 've clocked up a goodly number of longish relationships that never resulted in hitchings or hatchings .
Unlike in my parents ' day , we may jump into bed quicker but , if it 's not working out , we rarely lie on the bed we 've made .
We surf for new dates .
We search for upgrades .
We expect more .
And sometimes we get less .
With many more Britons living solo ( singletons occupy nearly a third of all homes ) and less financial interdependence between the sexes , dating has become ever more removed from mating .
And if I 'm honest , no matter how much I thought I wanted a traditional family set - up , armed with my own income and high expectations , I was easily drawn to alpha males who had yet to develop their nesting instincts .
Why , for example , did I spend nearly three years in my mid-thirties with a divinely handsome Frenchman eight years my junior , who I knew in my heart of hearts was n't ready for marriage and children ?
Answer : because he was a divinely handsome Frenchman eight years my junior .
Eventually , I lost him to a new job in Paris and a Porsche , as I always knew I would .
But I choose to treasure the romantic times together , however fleeting , however unfruitful , and realise I must own - and honour - my past dating decisions .
But perhaps , then , rather than simply incentivising would - be mothers , we need to pause and consider the nature of modern relationships .
Ask ourselves - both men and women - what we are ultimately seeking from them , not least because some of my 40 - something male friends , who years ago would have run for the hills at the sight of a baby wipe , are all at sea being single and childless .
We also have to take on board our love affair with kidulthood .
Stuart Gall , director of Biofusion , a company that 's recently launched Plan Ahead ( www.life-style-choices.com), a mail - order fertility test , says : ' Many people look much younger than their counterparts in previous generations and we 've become so accustomed to opening the pages of Hello !
and seeing 40 - plus celebs with their babies , there 's this perception that in fertility terms , we 've become biologically younger too .
The fact is we have n't and people need to understand that .
Which is why we 've designed this test to offer a predictive assessment of the number of eggs in a woman 's ovaries because ovarian reserve is a key factor in a woman 's potential to get pregnant .
This can help her make an informed decision about whether to try for a baby sooner rather than later . '
Some geneticists predict that for future generations it will be more common for young women to remove and freeze some of their healthy eggs .
However , Dr Gillian Lockwood , medical director of Midland Fertility Services , who headed the team that helped bring the UK 's first 'ice twins ' into the world , stresses it 's not an insurance policy .
' I'm very happy to offer the procedure to my young cancer patients because this may be their only chance of having their own baby .
But I would hate any woman who was in a position to have a child , and who knew that being a biological mum was a very impoprtant part of her life plan , to put it on ice in the expectation that it would be OK .
' However , I 've had a few patients recently who 've come to me at the end of a long relationship that they assumed was going to result in marriage and children and it has n't , and now they do n't want to be on a first date having to ask a chap about his thoughts on babies .
Yet at the same time they know time is running out .
And as I take the view that having options is one of the most empowering aspects of people 's lives , and because biological time is so unkind to women , I would rather a woman was in a position to make those choices than finding that her choices had been taken away .
' It 's important to realise these are not selfish women who want to " have it all " , ' she adds .
' Commitment - phobe men can be an extraordinary problem for many of today 's women .
Although interestingly , in many cases , when the man in a partnership was less keen to be a parent than his partner and then a baby comes along , he suddenly turns into the most doting of fathers . '
For me , it 's too late for hi-tech hedging .
What 's been important however , is dealing with the feeling that I have n't fulfilled a fundamental part of being female .
This may sound strange but I really wanted to experience giving birth , a visceral act that binds us to the cycle of life .
When I see that stock soap opera scene of a sweating , swearing , screaming woman , knees to camera , I can't help thinking , it 's odd I 'll never know what that 's like .
As Liz Scott says : ' It 's such a primitive drive , it connects to your sense of self .
And this can take quite a knock after an infertility diagnosis or failure to have a child . '
However , where I differ from women with physiological problems is that while they 're often angry at their bodies for letting them down , I used to feel the opposite .
That I 'd let down my fit , healthy body .
That I 'd cast a shadow of futility over my fertility .
But over time , I 've come to realise that identity - and femininity - are n't governed solely by the experience of being a mother , but by the courage to be yourself , whatever your situation .
I do think mothers could help non-mothers a bit more .
Because in truth , it is often they who have , albeit inadvertently , hurt me the most .
Particularly stinging is the breezily flung sentiment that it's not until you 've had a child that you experience real love .
Maybe .
But when you love passionately - and try to live compassionately - that 's a bloody hard assessment to accept with a cheery nod of the head .
I also get a bit twitchy constantly hearing how mothers get a raw deal at work .
I know , I know they have genuine struggles , but the grass is n't always greener on the other side of the playpen .
During 15 years working in offices , I was rarely able to take two consecutive weeks ' holiday , yet other staff were on maternity leave , a couple for the third time in five years .
I remember wanting to scream , ' Maybe I just need a couple of weeks off - a sabbatical even - to get over not having a baby . '
But I did n't .
I kept my head down and stayed mum .
The only occasions I do bite back is when , after expressing my horror at some catastrophic piece of world news - children being murdered , maimed or abused - women , who know I do n't have kids , reply , ' Of course , this is so much harder to take when you 're a mother . '
I explain I 'm expressing shock and sympathy on account of being human , which I rather hope is some kind of qualification .
Being shut out hurts .
Being included helps .
Enormously .
As does straightforward acknowledgement of your unchosen situation .
When my friend Deborah said in a completely no-messing fashion , ' Yes , it 's a shame you did n't have children .
You would have been a great mother , ' it was truly liberating .
An answer that helped me to start letting go .
And I have .
Now , I 'm ready to stretch my freedom until it screams for mercy .
I want to travel .
Take photographs .
Write books .
Polish my pointe work at ballet class .
Flirt .
Laugh .
Take myself lightly .
Indeed , as odd as this sounds , even if I had the chance to settle down , I would decline the offer .
Because after years of low - level yearning , emotionally , the moment has passed .
And in a spirit of acceptance , I think I 've discovered a state of grace .
And a taste for adventure .
Some things tug at my coattails still .
Baby - cradling .
Kissing an infant 's vellum - soft head .
And at the other end of life 's story , I imagine when the time comes to ensure my parents are cared for , having had no children of my own , it may seem like I 've skipped a stage .
And raise the question , ' Who will care for me ? '
To whom will I leave my precious belongings / home / photographs of me as a child / vintage ( by then ) shoe - mountain ?
Also tough are high days and Christmas holidays .
However cool you are with it , there 's always that nose - on - a - sweetshop - window moment .
When I last stayed at Deb 's for Christmas , I woke up in a teenager 's bedroom beneath a Coca - Cola mobile with the words ' It 's The Real Thing ' spinning above my head .
As family Christmases go , I knew it was n't , nor ever would it be .
But how I loved them for sharing it with me .
And how I loved the younger boys for insisting I christen their Robosapien ( Chico from Pop Idol got their vote , as you 're asking ) .
What 's more , when I drove away , after the two of them hugged me goodbye , I realised that while they may not be mine , that giant , wonderful , un - shy embrace was a very real thing after all ....

From his treatment , Kendall Gibson would seem to be one of the state of Virginia 's most dangerous prisoners .
For more than 10 years he has lived in segregation at the Greensville Correctional Center , spending at least 23 hours every day in a cell the size of a gas station bathroom .
In a temporary home for the worst of the worst - inmates too violent or disruptive to live among the rest of society 's outcasts - he has been a permanent fixture .
He is there , he says , not for his crimes but for a crime he will not commit - a crime against God .
The only thing imposing about Gibson is his long black dreadlocks , resting on the front of his shoulders so they wo n't drag the ground as he shuffles along in his orange jumpsuit .
It is his hair - winding locks he considers a measure of his Rastafarian faith - that makes him a threat , according to Virginia Department of Corrections Operating Procedure No. 864.1 .
The rule took effect on Dec. 15 , 1999 .
Inmates had two choices : cut their hair no longer than their collars and shave their beards , or be placed in administrative segregation .
In the beginning , Gibson was among as many as 40 inmates who opted for confinement over cutting .
By 2003 , when a handful of the inmates filed a federal lawsuit against the department over their detention , 23 remained in segregation .
The lawsuit failed .
Some cracked under the pressure of constant isolation with no visits from loved ones , educational or religious programs or commissary .
Some went home .
Today , it is difficult to tell exactly how many remain in isolation .
The Department of Corrections will not volunteer the information but has confirmed 10 names given to The Associated Press by a group of Rastafarian inmates .
Not everyone can handle it , Gibson says .
For those weak in mind or spirit , the walls can easily close in on them .
" People always ask how I can smile in a place so negative , " he says .
The Rastafarian God , Jah , " is my answer .
Without Jah in my life I would n't be able to handle it . "
More of a way of life
Like most of the Rastafarians in segregation , Gibson did not become a believer until after he entered prison .
He was 18 and had a long time to do , sentenced to 47 years on robbery , abduction and gun charges .
Gibson had always loved the " peaceful vibes of Rastafari livity , " or belief system , but like many he knew the movement by the hair , the music and the ganja , or cannabis .
In prison , he met others who taught him the spiritual aspects .
He took on the name Ras - Talawa Tafari , a strong leader who inspires awe .
Rastafari draws from the Bible , mixing in African and Caribbean cultural influences .
It is considered by many more of a way of life or movement than a religion .
They preach unity with god , nature and each other , but are loosely organized and followers are free to worship with other congregations .
Rastafarians regard Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I , who was known as Ras Tafari before he rose to power in 1930 , as the second coming of Christ .
They believe Jah inhabits them so there it no real need for a church .
They smoke marijuana as a sacrament and adhere to a vegetarian diet .
While some view growing their hair as optional , most Rastafarians see it as demanded by the Nazarite Vow in the Bible ( Numbers 6:5 ) , " There shall no razor come upon his head . "
Gibson never entertained the thought of cutting his hair when the policy was announced or during the 10 long years since .
" Jah did n't lead I to feel that this plight was burden enough to bow , " he says .
A person must be willing to stand up and fight for a worthy cause , he says , echoing Rastafarian messenger Bob Marley 's rhythmic chant " Get up .
Stand up .
Stand up for your rights . "
Gibson longs to hear such reggae music .
A clear analog radio that picks up about nine stations is his only luxury in his small cell , but the island music does n't get much air time in these parts .
His days are long but compact .
Five days a week , he is led in restraints to an outside cage that resembles a dog kennel for an hour of recreation .
Otherwise , he only leaves his 8 - by - 10 cell for three , 20 - minute showers each week .
His cinderblock walls are off - white or gray , depending on the way the light hits them .
The cell is freshly painted , drowning out the smell of his Dove soap resting on his one - piece sink - toilet unit .
If he stands on top of his mounted stainless steel bed , Gibson can peak out the window , where he can see inmates in the general population recreation yard in the distance .
He prefers to stare into the woods just beyond the razor - wife fence .
On occasion he spies a deer grazing in the field .
The segregation unit has 16 cells , and although the inmates cannot see each other , they often talk .
Gibson is amazed at what he calls their pure confusion and senseless babbling - obsession with the lives of movie stars and rappers and sports figures .
And then there are the other Rastafarians .
" These people may have my physical body confined , but I refuse to surrender my mind and spirit , " says Allen McRae , also known as Ras-Solomon Tafari , who is serving 20 years for cocaine possession .
Elton Williams , who is behind bars for armed robbery , gets the question all the time from inmates pulling stints in segregation .
Would n't it be easier just to cut his hair ?
His answer : " My very soul depends on the decisions I make . "
Williams , 31 , likens it to a Christian who is told that , for security reasons , he must denounce Christ .
Williams is set to leave prison in December ; he could cut his hair until then , he says , but what would happen to his soul ?
Then there was Ivan Sparks , a 59 - year - old Rastafarian elder who refused to cut his hair and was sent into segregation at Buckingham Correctional Center .
He never left it - except to die at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center last fall , of prostate cancer .
Rules in place
The way Department of Corrections officials see it , the inmates could come out of segregation any time they wish .
They made a choice to go to segregation instead of cutting their hair , spokesman Larry Traylor says .
Should they decide to comply with the grooming policy , they could return to general population .
" Rules must be in place in order to have a secure , safe environment for everyone , " Traylor said .
" An inmate that will not follow the rules jeopardizes normal prison operations and is potentially a danger to other inmates and staff . "
Virginia is among only about a dozen states , mostly in the South , that limit the length of inmates ' hair and beards , according to the American Correctional Chaplains Association .
A handful of those allow religious accommodations for Rastafarians , Muslims , Sikhs , native Americans and others whose religious beliefs prohibit shaving or cutting their hair .
There is no hair policy for federal prisoners .
The U.S. Supreme Court has said that constitutional protections , like the right to practice religion , do not end at the prison gates .
Congress has said institutions can restrict religious liberties only for compelling reasons , like security , but the policies must be the least restrictive means to accomplish that .
Still , inmates have rarely been successful in challenging prison grooming policies .
An American Indian inmate spent a year in his cell and lost other privileges before a federal appeals court ruled in 2005 that the California prison system 's ban on long hair violated his religious freedom .
In a 2002 case , a group of Rastafarian and Muslim federal inmates who were housed in Virginia prisons challenged the grooming policy and a federal court ordered the Bureau of Prisons to transfer them to other facilities that did not have such policies .
The court also required the federal prison system to evaluate inmates ' religious beliefs and refrain from sending them to Virginia or other states with burdensome grooming policies .
In the case filed by the Virginia state prisoners , a federal appeals court ruled in 2008 that the Department of Corrections ' argument that inmates could hide weapons and other contraband in long hair or easily change their appearance upon escape was compelling enough reason to require trimmed hair .
Kent Willis , executive director of the Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union , which represented the inmates , said the outcome was deeply disappointing because he knew the sincerest believers would be those who would be punished most severely .
" This has a disturbingly mean - spirited aspect to it , " Willis says .
" This is not about corrections .
This is not about security , but it 's about punishment .
In this instance , people are being punished for their religious beliefs . "
Today , the department cuts each inmate 's hair when he enters prison .
If he refuses , the use of " reasonable force and restraints " is authorized .
If the inmate grows his hair back and refuses to cut it , he is sent to segregation .
Thomas Fitzgerald , 52 , had grown his locks for 10 years before he was sent to prison for possession of a firearm by a felon .
He said he started going bald after his hair was unceremoniously shorn from his head , and he is convinced that there is a connection .
The last time he saw his locks they were being stuffed into a red biohazard plastic bag .
He asked to send them home for a proper burial ; his request was denied .
Fitzgerald has chosen to abide by the grooming policy so that he can work toward growing the Rastafarian community inside the prison and when he is released in three years .
But it is hard to shake the humiliation : " Every day is a real struggle for me , because I perceive shaving my face a serious act of mutilation to myself , " he says .
Upful vibrations
With his prison - issue eyeglasses , scrawny frame and boyish smile , Gibson looks much less of a menace than the prisoners stacking lunch trays just outside the glass - walled visitation room .
Even less intimidating are his words - talk of love , faith , " upful vibrations " and , most perplexing of all , happiness .
Now 38 , he is proud of the things he has accomplished while behind bars .
Gibson quit school at 15 , but once in prison he completed vocational training in building maintenance and carpentry and in 1994 got his GED , the equivalent of a high school diploma , which he said gave him an " irie , " or peaceful and happy feeling .
Gibson 's five co-defendants are out of prison now .
He has been denied parole 12 times for the same reason , the serious nature of his crime , but he knows his refusal to bow to the grooming policy probably played a role in that .
" Life is what we make of it , " he says .
" Jah give each person the fullness of free will to create our own personal heaven or hell and joy or pain . "
He tries " to create good irie vibes of joy and not of pain . "
He has bad days , but he tries not to brood , even though he remains in isolation , year after year , as those who murder , rape and maim other inmates are rotated in and out .
He has now been in isolation nearly 4,000 days .
He begins each one with prayer , reading scripture and meditation .
At night , when the lights are out , he listens to rodents scampering through the ducts .
Sometimes they run across his cell floor and he cringes .
When it is quiet he can hear a train chugging by , and he allows his mind to wonder briefly what is on it , and where it is going .
Dena Potter is an Associated Press writer .
Arjen Robben made a promise yesterday to not dive next season .
The Dutchman has been criticised for going to ground too easily , particularly against Liverpool in February when José Reina raised his hand , while Didier Drogba 's recent tumbling has further damaged Chelsea 's reputation for fair play .
" Those things happened , " said Robben .
" Diving has been a very big issue this season , I think .
Everyone has his opinion about it .
I have mine .
You have yours .
I do n't want to look back .
I want to look forward .
Next season I wo n't be in the headlines for diving again .
That 's a promise .
Next year you wo n't write about me diving again . "
Robben said the regularity with which he fell last season was because of his mental state , created by bad experiences in 2004 - 05 .
" If you look back to the season before this , I had three injuries , " he said .
" I think people forget that sometimes .
At that time I had comments like : ' You have to jump sometimes ' and ' you have to avoid getting kicked ' because I broke my foot three times .
Sometimes you just jump out of the way .
Sometimes maybe the style of jumping or falling is not the nicest but I have n't been kicked this season and that 's a good thing .
I 'm not a diver .
I know that .
Next season I 'll just carry on the way I play and I wo n't change my game at any time . "
The flak Robben endured for his style of avoiding injury this season - with Chelsea 's manager Jose Mourinho believed to have been unhappy about it - means Robben could be forgiven for seeking refuge by leaving Stamford Bridge .
With the arrival of Michael Ballack imminent , a move would seem logical but Robben feels he still has a lot to offer .
" People forget I 'm still only 22 .
I have a lot of confidence .
I 'm not afraid about losing my place .
Maybe with some extra world - class players coming in it 's going to be even harder but I am very confident . "
Should We Abolish the OLCC ?
In this week 's Mercury ( hitting the streets this afternoon ) I write about the conflicted role of theas both the distributor of alcohol and the regulator of its consumption .
The agency itself is a leftover from the repeal of Prohibition , when a few states were worried about a rapid spread of drunkenness and decided to enforce their own temperance laws and controls on sales .
That gave rise to the 19 states that are currently " control states , " where a state agency has a monopoly in selling some or all alcoholic beverages .
Here , liquor stores are state - run , and the OLCC handles wholesaling of beer and wine to distributors collects taxes on beer and wine sales .
As you may guess , this bothers some people who do n't like the state running things .
Today 's editorial in the Oregonian takes what it calls " a hard look at liquor sales " in Oregon .
Editorial page editor Bob " DUII " Caldwell and friends mention , but stop short of endorsing , Chris Dudley 's proposal to abolish the OLCC 's monopoly on liquor sales .
They point to a pair of initiatives that could see the ballot in Washington ( another control state ) this fall , which would put liquor sales into private hands .
Costco is a big backer of that initiative , and began petitioning its shoppers in May .
And on Friday , July 9 , Jeff Alworth posted a call to " Kill the OLCC " to his Beervana blog .
He draws attention to another recent Oregonian op - ed by vintner William Hatcher that calls for completely dismantling the organization .
He also links to a piece by the Bend Bulletin 's Nick Budnick about a private audit that found some pretty damning evidence of inefficiencies within the labyrinthine organization .
If the OLCC stops running liquor stores , the state misses out on the markup from hard - liquor sales .
But if places like Safeway can sell it , the state can still slap a heavy tax on the stuff .

Cancer : More Care , More Cost , Less Cure
by Bill Sardi
Recently by Bill Sardi : Who Will Watch the Watchers ?
Health authorities do n’t foresee any cancer cures on the horizon .
The World Health Organization estimates annual cancer cases will rise from 12.7 million to 21 million , and cancer deaths will jump from 7.6 million to more than 13 million , by the year 2030 .
That ’s over 35,000 people dying of cancer every day .
Over those two decades , world population is projected to increase from 7.01 billion to 9.30 billion , a rise of about 30 % , while cancer cases and deaths will increase by 65 — 70 % .
Advancing age is the harbinger of cancer
Despite concerns over carcinogens in the environment — cancer - causing agents such as herbicides , asbestos , and hormones — cancer is an age - related disease .
Cancer was not a major health problem when life expectancy was 48 years for a newborn American child in the year 1900 .
But the life expectancy of Americans has risen upwards to nearly 80 years today and cancer affects nearly every extended family in America .
Living longer increases the risk for cancer many fold .
Sixty percent of all cancer occurs in persons over age 65 years .
While the overall rate of cancer hovers at 204 per 100,000 for adults under age 65 , it is 2225 per 100,000 for adults over age 65 .
That ’s 11 times greater risk !
This is why it has been said that an anti-aging pill would likely reduce the incidence of cancer better than any treatment for existing tumors .
Slow the rate of aging so the onset of age - related diseases like cancer is delayed by 7 years or so , and you also spare Medicare from inevitable insolvency .
The prospect of an anti-aging pill may not be too far away .
Cellular debris called lipofuscin that accumulates with advancing age has been reversed with a nutriceutical in a human , suggesting biological aging can even be reversed .
One step forward , two steps back
With no single therapy expected to cure cancer , care of cancer patients today looks like an expensive menu of toxic treatments that offer marginal benefit .
The five - year survival for all types of cancer is only about 43 % .
Meanwhile , the cost of cancer care has risen astronomically .
News headlines herald the introduction of gene - targeted cancer drugs and promising anti-cancer vaccines which only increase survival by a few months .
Lung cancer dominates cancer statistics
Lung cancer still comprises the majority of cancers and the decline in tobacco use has done more to reduce the incidence and mortality from cancer overall .
About 21 % of Americans smoke tobacco today compared to 45 % in 1954 .
Also , women have backed away from taking hormone replacement pills , which has resulted in a dramatic decline in breast cancer cases and deaths .
These examples serve as evidence that significant advances that are being made in cancer are on the side of prevention , not treatment .
More infuriating , while major efforts are made to prevent cancer , U.S. cigarette manufacturers are reported to place more cancer - causing nitrosamines , about triple the amount found in cigarette brands in Australia , Canada or the United Kingdom .
Even more maddening is the fact that menthol , a flavored tobacco additive used to mask the bitter taste and reduce the harshness of cigarette smoke , increases the delivery of tobacco carcinogens to the human body .
This may help explain why males in Japan who smoke incessantly do n’t develop lung cancer at anywhere near the same rate as Americans .
The odds of developing lung cancer in the US are 40 times greater among smokers than non-smokers compared to a 3.5 times increased risk in Japan .
Furthermore , it appears the cancer threat posed by nitrosamines in cigarettes can be completely negated by the use of vitamin C pills .
But little or nothing is said about this , possibly because it may give smokers license to keep smoking .
Promising drugs that disappoint
Drug companies are being rewarded for developing blockbuster anti-cancer drugs that are more of a financial success than a cure .
If the current trend continues , cancer patients in the year 2030 will take a dozen drugs at the cost of thousands of dollars per day to add less than a year to their survival .
The burgeoning cost of cancer care comes at a time when the health insurance system is fast becoming insolvent .
The need is for 10 - cent cures , not the expensive drugs now in the cancer pipeline .
Pharmaceutical companies act as if there will be endless money to pay for drugs that do n’t cure .
Desperate cancer patients are left holding their breath for a breakthrough in cancer treatment .
Breast cancer patients hear of a breakthrough — an anti-cancer vaccine .
But it wo n’t likely be available for another decade .
There is an effort to speed up the approval for anti-cancer drugs , which now have a median approval time of 7 years .
However , the gold - standard for anti-cancer therapy is five - year survival .
Rushing towards approval will likely produce even more ineffective and problematic drugs .
The FDA approves cancer drugs if they temporarily shrink a tumor by at least 50 % even though they do not improve survival .
Many existing anti-cancer drugs should be retrospectively disapproved because they inevitably produce tumor resistance and destruction of the patient ’s immune system .
Detecting cancer earlier : a new test
It must be particularly galling to the cancer care industry that a hound can sniff out cancer more reliably than most modern cancer screening technologies .
In a recent study , a Belgian Malinois shepherd , a breed of dog with a powerful sense of smell , was able to accurately detect cancer in 63 of 66 cases by the smell of the patient ’s urine .
Researchers still do n’t know what molecule in the urine of cancer patients alerts the dog .
On a more encouraging note , a British company has developed a test that makes it possible to detect cancer at a much earlier stage .
Generally , conventional cancer detection tools find tumors when they are about two - thirds of the way through their development .
For example , lung tumors can be the size of a tennis ball before detection .
The earliest screening detection is only picking up cancer after more than 20 cell divisions , while death normally comes after about 40 .
The new test , just now becoming available , detects signals emitted by the cancer patient ’s immune system — autoantibodies — that are the earliest molecular sign of cancer .
The problem is , without effective treatments , what good is early detection ?
What is needed is true prevention , not more treatment .
Pouring water on the wrong fire
A major misdirection of modern cancer therapy is that it is focused on treating the initial tumor rather than the circulating tumor cells that have escaped into the blood circulation .
Imagine fire fighters dousing flames on a burning house while flames spread to neighboring homes without a drop of water being poured on them .
Targeting tumor cells in circulation is what is needed .
This means boosting the sometimes sluggish immune system to actively engulf or destroy roaming tumor cells .
Cancer vaccines are purported to do just that , but they appear to be of limited value .
Researchers admit cancer vaccines " will never be a stand - alone therapy " and will need to be combined with standard treatments and immune boosters .
Vaccines against prostate and breast cancer are widely trumpeted by the news media .
Provenge , the recently approved anti-prostate cancer vaccine , involves re-injection of the patients own white blood cells back into their circulation and is said to add 4.5 months to survival time at an anticipated cost ranging from $ 30,000 to $ 90,000 .
The public generally believes vaccines are intended to prevent disease .
However , this anti-prostate cancer vaccine is n’t intended to prevent prostate cancer , it is only intended for use in advanced stages of the disease .
The best 10 - cent cure : vitamin D
It appears the cancer industry favors complicated and expensive therapies over simple inexpensive cures .
This is certainly true for prostate cancer .
Why remove the patient ’s own immune cells when they can be stimulated in a dramatic manner by vitamin D? Vitamin D has a striking effect upon progression of prostate cancer , particularly among patients with a low - circulating level of vitamin D to begin with .
It is the patients ’ best 10 - cent cancer cure .
In lieu of sunlight , it appears supplemental vitamin D is fast becoming a universal anti-cancer agent that should be employed for both prevention and therapy .
The problem is that vitamin D’s anti-tumor effect is often reduced in late stages of cancer .
The vitamin D receptor located on the cell wall , to which vitamin D binds ( attaches ) , often becomes insensitive to vitamin D in advanced - stage cancer .
However , the co-administration of vitamin E succinate and / or resveratrol increases vitamin D cell receptor protein and its sensitivity to vitamin D itself .
Other natural molecules that enhance the anti-cancer action of vitamin D are menthol , a component of peppermint oil , curcumin from turmeric spice , and gamma tocotrienol , another form of vitamin E .
Another important tip to optimize vitamin D is to make sure your intake of magnesium is adequate .
Depletion of magnesium reduces blood concentration of vitamin D. Magnesium supplementation increases vitamin D levels .
Some smartly designed vitamin D supplements provide magnesium .
A ray of hope : anti-angiogenesis
In 1998 , New York Times science reporter Gina Kolata asked Nobel Prize - winning scientist James Watson what was new in the world of science , he replied , “ Judah Folkman and angiogenesis , that ’s what ’s new .
Judah is going to cure cancer in two years . ”
That became a news headline that encircled the globe .
Actually , Dr. Folkman had proposed the idea of starving growing tumors by cutting off their blood supply in 1971 .
Today so - called anti-angiogenic drugs are undergoing human study and the first such drug ( Avastin , bevacizumab ) was approved for use in 2004 .
Millions of cancer patients now receive drugs intended to inhibit new blood vessel formation associated with tumor growth .
As background information , when you incur a cut in your skin , chemical growth factors are released in that area which weaken nearby blood vessels , which then sprout new tributaries in the direction of the wound .
This is all part of a natural wound - healing mechanism .
When the wound is healed , the new blood vessels recede .
But in cancer these new blood vessels persist , to provide oxygen and nutrients for tumor growth .
Surgical removal of a solid tumor only produces more wound healing chemicals that further stimulates angiogenesis ( new blood vessel formation ) .
The new blood vessels become a conduit for cancer cells to escape , spread and develop into distant tumors called metastases .
Inhibit the new blood vessels ( anti-angiogenesis ) and the tumor cannot grow beyond the size of a few millimeters .
The trick is to do this without totally inhibiting the regenerative ( wound healing ) processes in the body .
In 2005 , Nature magazine published a major review of the field of angiogenesis research and predicted that " angiogenesis research will probably change the face of medicine in the next decades " with more than 500 million people worldwide predicted to benefit from anti-angiogenesis drugs .
However , nearly four decades after Dr. Folkman ’s discovery of angiogenesis and tumor growth , researchers sadly admit " the clinical benefits of anti-angiogenesis therapy are modest and usually measured in weeks or months . "
The response to anti-angiogenic therapy is only transient .
Yet the cancer industry arrogantly describes the achievements of researchers involved in this field as " remarkable . "
Enter Dr. William Li of the Angiogenesis Foundation in Boston .
Dr. Li is an understudy of Dr. Judah Folkman .
Dr. Li says tumors are generally out of control by the time anti-angiogenesis therapy is administered .
Earlier intervention is what is needed .
His research shows that certain foods , herbs and spices contain natural anti-angiogenesis agents that in many instances are more potent than some of the widely - touted anti-angiogenic drugs .
Dr. Li shows a slide in his online presentation of the most potent natural anti-angiogenic agents discovered so far .
Presented in descending order they are : vitamin E , tea leaves , turmeric , glucosamine , green tea , olive , brassica ( cruciferous vegetables ) , red grapes , garlic , soy and berries .
The Angiogenesis Foundation is in the process of identifying and scoring varieties of plant foods for their anti-angiogenic properties .

# 1 yungchin commented on 2008 - 02 - 27 : Hi , nice post .
I 'd be interested to read more about how you 've set up version control on your home dir ( could make a nice blog post ? :) ) .
I have n't figured out a manageable way yet ( using bzr ) - there are always lots of new files appearing that have to go to your ignore - list , or something like that ...
Thanks !

# 2 Eliot commented on 2008 - 03 - 26 : yungchin ,
thanks .
i am still refining the process of how to use the version control .
i plan to post about it sometime soon .
please let me know what solution you go with as well .
# 3 manuel quinta commented on 2008 - 10 - 17 : I use rdiff - backup since years to make backups over ssh , and i'am happy with it .
we used rsnapshot on our server , to make a backup over ssh .
but it took a lot of cpu ?
also we did a crazy missconfiguration , as we wanted to stop the hourly backup , because of the cpu load .
wenn you suspend the hourly backup , it will not make a daily ... it just stoped to make any backup !
we did only see it by incident a half a year later , but we did not lose any data !
luckely !
# 4 Eliot commented on 2008 - 10 - 17 : manuel , Thanks for the notes on your experiences .
# 5 Chris Wilper commented on 2008 - 12-01 : Note on rdiff - backup , for transparency , there is a FUSE implementation called archfs that allows you to mount all snapshots in a read - only filesystem .
It 's a little rough around the edges , but I 've been impressed now that I 've got it to work .
It occurs to me that it should be possible to run rdiff - backup against the fuse - exposed snapshots , in order , skipping the ones you do n't want .
Have n't tried it , but it would be an interesting experiment ...
# 6 Eliot commented on 2008 - 12-08 : Chris , thanks a lot for the information .
Please feel free to leave a link to your notes if you 've posted any .
# 7 johnP commented on 2009 - 06 - 18 :
We 've been using rdiff - backup for a few months .
Our requirements are for a cross platform , cheap , solution , so anything that required hard - link support could n't be considered .
Personally , I 'd wipe all the MS - windows server machines , but our customers would be mad .
We 're mostly * NIX for production systems , with a few Windows dev VMs .
In that time , we 've recovered from " oops " moments twice .
Once was during an email system upgrade that could n't be completed and the other was while screwing with an Alfresco system permissions model that failed in the end .
Backups rock , but folks here already know that .
Has anyone solved the remote Windows backup issue in a good free way that can actually be restored without loss of user and group permissions ?
rdiff - backup is mostly good , but there are a few problems .
Large file differencing does n't work in our experience .
If it does n't crash , you 'll get a completely new copy .
We tried backing up complete Xen image files this way .
We got around this issue by mounting the IMG files on the host and pushing the rdiff - backup to another system on the same LAN .
Complete system backups are 2 - 3 minutes now .
That works for Xen , but not VirtualBox with a Vista - 64 host .
Any ideas ?
# 8 Eliot commented on 2009 - 06 - 22 : johnP , Thank you for adding your experience with rdiff - backup .
I 'm sorry I can't be of any to help to you .
Maybe another visitor will have ideas .
# 9 Jakob Malm commented on 2009 - 07-07 : I 've been using rdiff - backup for my home system since March 2008 and am overall happy with it .
I 've had to restore single files a few times , and though that procedure is not _very_ straightforward , it 's been easy enough to figure out how to do it the few times I 've needed it .
The FUSE file system seems interesting .
My biggest gripe with rdiff - backup is that backing up large files like VirtualBox disk images takes very long .
Since there is no progress indication , and I do backups manually ( when I see a need for it ) , this can be a bit frustrating .
But I have n't experienced any problems with it like johnP writes , and the resulting increment files appear to be reasonably small .
# 10 Eliot commented on 2009 - 07 - 08 : Jakob , thanks for adding your experience also .
Good to hear rdiff - backup makes you happy .
# 11 koolnyze commented on 2009 - 10 - 09 : I have been using rdiff - backup for a long time and it seems to be working well .
# 12 Maccy commented on 2010 - 01 - 11 : I have been using rdiff - backup for a couple of years now with just a few restore operations and so far i am lucky with it .
Recently i did a small trial on changing meta data of media files such as comments on jpeg 's or ID3 - tags on mp3 or OGG files .
Since rdiff - backup is storing only diffs even on binary files , i expected the diffs to be tiny .
However , the diffs i got so far are roughly halve the size of the original file when i changed a few characters .
The background for this is the question whether media data should have a rsync or a rdiff backup .
Currently I 'm doing rsync on my pictures ( jpg ) and audio files ( ogg ) .
My plan was to change this to rdiff , basically to be save against deletion of the files .
This would be a perfect solution if rdiff - backup would find the real differences in the file , e.g. the changed matadata .
Otherwise it will mess up my backup system with a lot of unnecessary data .
So for the time beeing i will keep rsync for media data and rdiff - backup for all the other files .
# 13 Leho Kraav commented on 2010 - 03 - 27 : hi thanks for the write - up .
i think i'll be going rsnapshot for gentoo server backup strategy .
is it possible to get an rss feed for the comments of this post ?
# 14 Eliot commented on 2010 - 03 - 27 : Leho Kraav : thanks , a comments feed is a good idea .
i will try to add it this weekend .
UPDATE : I 've created the comments feed .
See above for the feed link .
# 15 Leho Kraav commented on 2010 - 03 - 29 : is there a better way to test the feed than giving them kudos to the author !?
i thinks not !

I forgot to filter the spam from the feed .
It should be fixed now .

Thank you for your clear break down .. much time saved :) on what would have been a wild - goose - chase considering I just need a traditional backup set - up .
# 18 Richard commented on 2010 - 05 - 20 : http://old.nabble.com/Differences-between-rsnapshot-and-rdiff-backup-td15282022.html
Did you write this too ?
This guy is referencing to the O'Reilly " Backup & Recovery " book .
# 19 Eliot commented on 2010 - 05 - 21 : Richard : yes , that was my message to the mailing list , before I posted this on my blog .
Yeah I forgot to include that I used that book as a reference .
I updated the post above to include the book reference and links to the discussions on the two mailing lists .
# 20 Harland commented on 2010 - 06 - 17 : I have been using rdiff - backup for over 3yrs .
It works well for etc , var , and home and I have restored home files because of user error a number of times ; it works well but dont get an average user to do it .
I came up with and use a hybrid solution with rsnapshot for these PITA cases .
I use rdiff - backup to take daily snapshots on the same host to a different disk , which are then rsync'd to a server ( I know rdiff - backup can do this , but trial and sweat have chosen ) .
I then use rsnapshot for hourly and daily snapshots and let the user have at it .
When ' they ' do something and lose their ' most needed ' file , they just look into the rsnapshot ' copies ' and pullout the one they need .
If they have to go back further than a week ( which almost never happens ) , then I can dig it out of rdiff - backup ' copies ' and dump it on their host .
Yes it takes a little extra space to have the extra ' copy ' but for ease of use , this saves ( my ) time / effort .
And just for fun , I still do quarterly tarballs incase doom sets in = ) .
I would love an hybrid of these two excellent programs , but can python and perl really be friends ...
Whats really needed is filemanager plugin to display the snapshots ' on a right click context menu for a given file or directory .
# 21 Howard commented on 2010 - 06 - 28 :
Thanks for the excellent writeup .
Whilst habitually following bu solutions , I find it pretty confusing re : pro/con of the multiple solutions .
Pretty well settled on rdiff - backup as I run five o/s on the same box and chrono backup is not very meaningful for me .
I would note that newbies to command line backup , probably want to prefix their command with ' time ' to obtain elapsed data .
Also , you really need to figure out the right parms for backup AND ( test it ! ) RESTORE , then incorporate them into a script .
Else , a great chance you will forget the parms !
One other recommendation : do a bare metal backup with something like clonezilla .
You do not need to change it unless you modify your partitions , but great peace of mind having redundancy to recover from a disaster !
Howard addl argument for CLI vs GUI : I have had good luck with ctl-c to KILL cli backups , not so good luck with gui ( Lucky Backup one of the exceptions ) .
# 22 Travis H. commented on 2010 - 07 - 17 :
Hey there , I 'm working on a disk - to - disk backup utility , called hdb ( hard drive backup ) : http://www.subspacefield.org/security/hdb/
I link to a variety of related tools , including duplicity , which may interest you .
I 'm a security weenie , and you can tell from my choice of technologies ( SHA - 512 hashes and encrypted backup media ) .
If you 're interested at all in high - speed disk - to - disk backups , then you might want to check out the tool and mlist .
It 's in alpha right now - so you can easily make suggestions that will affect its fate - but progressing rapidly .
Written 100 % in pure ruby ... no modules , nothing to install , just plop the script in ~ / bin and you 're done .
# 23 ændrük commented on 2010 - 08 - 12 :
Thanks for the explanation .
I 've heard several recommendations for both of these and never was clear on their differences .
# 24 JohnP commented on 2010 - 10 - 24 : Has anyone looked at bigsync ( C http://code.google.com/p/bigsync/) or BigSync ( perl http://stefan.hoefer.ch/projects/bigsync/5-bigsync-an-overview) or xdelta ( http://freshmeat.net/projects/xdelta/) for efficient large file backups ?
I 'm still looking for a cross platform , script - able way to deal with virtual machine image files .
We 're still using rdiff - backup here .
Complete VM backups only take about 2 - 3 minutes per day , but changes in our VM technology is forcing a revisit .
I 'm doing performance testing of some alternate solutions now and will post results to my blog when they are complete .
# 25 Steve Robbins commented on 2010 - 11- 06 : Nice comparison .
After reading your blog I think I 'm much more inclined right now to using rdiff - backup as my preferred backup software
# 26 JohnP commented on 2011 - 01 - 12 : For folks interested in a GUI , Back - In - Time seems to be rsnapshot with a GUI .
Deployed this on Mom's Linux machine and it is working very nicely with hourly , daily , weekly and monthly snapshots .
Nice if you are limited to * NIX file systems .
The automatic " smart " snapshot management of Back - In - Time is nice .
Duplicati is a GUI for Duplicity .
I found Duplicati to be extremely slow for both Full and incremental backups .
That 's an understatement , actually .
8.5 hours for a 100 GB backup seems excessive to me .
The only GUI I 've seen for rdif - backup is a web server - based solution .
Ew .
And in limited tests , rdiff - backup on Win64 to Win64 ( both truecrypted disk partitions ) of 18 GB virtual machines does only store the differences involved .
Truecrypt is n't really important to the tests , since both partitions were mounted to drive letters during the test .
Anyway , I wrote up my experiences with Duplicati vs Rdiff - backup in a blog entry .
# 27 Michael commented on 2011 - 01 - 15 : I would like the hard link - based implementation of rsnapshot for independent backups that would be simpler to recover .
However , I ended up rejecting it because it is based on the seriously flawed include / exclude rules of rsync ( sensitivity to trailing '/'s , etc , IIRC ) which are confusing , easy to get wrong , and often difficult to get right , even when you think you understand it .
For compatibility reasons , this design flaw in rsync will never be fixed .
In contrast , the author of rdiff - backup , using librsync rather than rsync itself , was free to implement a different , more straightforward approach to specifying files to be included or excluded , and did so .
This was for me a deciding factor , and I think it deserves a place in your list .
The only minor gripe I have with rdiff - backup is that it 's rather slow , but that 's not a major issue if you can leave it running , e.g. , at lunchtime .
# 28 Michael commented on 2011 -01 - 15 :
As an update on the last post , I just noticed that another Mike made the same point about ease of use at http://www.mail-archive.com/rdiff-backup-users@nongnu.org/msg02917.html
" Unlike rsync , rdiff - backup was written originally for backups .
It has sensible defaults ( so no need for the - av  - delete -e > ssh options ) and fewer quirks ( for instance , no distinction between < destination > , < destination >/ , and < destination >/. ) . "
A subsequent commenter pointed out the same approach I ended up using to cope with the fact that intermediate rdiff - backups could not be deleted ( i.e. you have to keep all the incremental backups back to the oldest one you need to keep ) : use separate repositories for short - and long - term backups .
I would still prefer an rdiff - backup implemented using hard links , but would not use rbackup and its crufty , embrangled rsync interface .
# 29 Aaron Boyd commented on 2011 - 12 - 21 : Great summary -- thank you .
Had I found your writeup earlier , I would have made my choice faster .
I came to the same conclusion for the same reasons and am liking rsnapshot .
rdiff - backup seemed better in most ways , but the inability to preserve my oldest backups ( when space becomes tight ) was a deal breaker .
# 30 leobard commented on 2012 - 02 - 26 : hey , I just evaluate buying a new linux fileserver for home .
I am using dirvish since years and it works fine for me .
Your observations about dirvish ring a bell - its a useful and well - done tool and easygoing but a bit awkward to setup .
The new hardware options I evaluate ( synology ds212 j or netgear readynas duo ) seem to slightly play better with rsnapshot .
conclusion : your post showed up in google on firstpage for " dirvish rsnapshot " and your summary was an excellent thinking I can build upon !
thanks !
__I will go for rsnapshot__ .
( and for home server hardware : __synology .
there are cookbooks to get rsnapshot running , but as its just a perl script piggybacking rsync , it should run on anything linux .
I was looking for a NAS and backup box for less than 200 $ and it has 15 Watt power drain with a fairly decent linux on top , so synology floats my boat )
# 31 nogi commented on 2012 - 08 - 07 : and " storebackup " ?
anyone use it ?
# 32 Pykler commented on 2013-01 - 19 : I use rsnapshot too and I love it .
I do like the fact that rdiff - backup makes deltas of files and I am thinking in the near future I might implement both ( since I like the daily , monthly , etc ... ) .
My idea is : rdiff - backup to pull in the files , and do an rsnapshot on the output of the rdiff - backup directory .
deploying these backups back out in the case of disaster recovery might be a small pain ... but not too hard for a small shell script wrapper to handle .
Thanks for the cool review .
# 33 Not a name commented on 2013 - 01 - 31 : I ran rdiff - backup for years , but the requirement that both the server and the client have to run compatible versions of rdiff - backup proved to be just too frustrating .
I have moved to rsnapshot because it has no such requirement .
I have also come to prefer the very transparent hard - link approach that rsnapshot uses .
# 34 Anselm Christophersen commented on 2013 - 11 - 20 : Long read , but worth it .
I started out with rdiff - backup , but as I 'm planning on setting up a solution that can backup my entire home dir ( ~500 GB and growing ) , speed IS a factor for me .
As well , the factor that I 'll be able to delete individual revisions is a big plus for me .
( Seems I 'll have to exclude virtual machines though , as I imagine they will make the backups grow very large - but that 's not a deal breaker for me , as I usually use VMs to do Windows Testing , and nothing more . )
# 35 Thomas commented on 2014 - 03 - 10 : setup : several linux computers ( ubuntu 10.04 lts ) running in home office / family home , windows running on virtualbox vm's only .
Notebook with 1 TB harddisk primary work - machine , often out - of - the - office at customer 's , since the need for offline collaboration .
Server is now 7 years old , but still sufficient with 1TB data disks and 2TB hot - swap backup - disks .
Drawback : Data consumption EXPLODES whenever directories are renamed .
Using mercurial , unison , rdiff - backup and tar for 5 + years now ( since I abandonded Windows ) , and being VERY pleased with all solutions .
Before rdiff - backup had ALL my personal data ( source code , scans , letters , projects , spreadsheets , pictures , fotos , measurement data files ... ) in yearly folders ( e.g. " 2007 - thomas " , " 2008 - thomas " , ... ) , each of those is a mercurial " project " ( so " 2007 - thomas/.hg /... " etc ) and on demand synchronized to a server ( mercurial on apache ) , also used to collaborate a yearly folder over several machines , e.g. when I do work ( edit documents , add scanned correspondence ) for my wife andrea ( e.g. get folder " 2013 - andrea " to my machine with hg pull , hg update , then edit the documents , when I 'm done i push it back to the server , then my wife pulls it back to her computer again and does a merge ) .
This works also nicely when off - line from server , e.g. she works at her office and I 'm working with her folders at the same time ... ) .
Because yearly folders got to big for mercurial ( 4 GB ++ ) to handle , switched to rdiff - backup and yearly folders with mass - data ( e.g. 2013 - thomas - massdata containing , photos , family videos , large measurement data files , etc ) .
These are backed - up on demand using rdiff - backup .
Un-personal data ( software installation packages , documentation ) stored in file - system only on same server , excerpts synchronized to mobile computer using unison only ( e.g. documentation I need to take to work with ) .
Backing up EVERYTHING above on server on backup - harddisks ( rotating schedule ) inserted into hot - swap drive bay using just UNISON .
No need for historical incremental backups since all version history is already maintained in the mercurial repositories , rdiff - backup folders and virtualbox snapshots .
Excerpt from unison preference , / srv/data is all the data to back - up , / srv/ bak2 is the mounted backup drive destination , keep changed or deleted files in / srv/bak2/data.unisonbak root = / srv/data root = / srv /bak2 / data force = / srv/data backuplocation = central backupdir = /srv/bak2/data.unisonbak

All the above personal / un - personal data is NOT in the home directory , only soft - linked to as it resides on another partition , system partition is 32 GB with i.e.

# 36 Josiah Johnston commented on 2016 - 06-03 :
Has anyone checked out rbackup ?
Their aim is to combine the simple automation features of rsnapshot with the disk benefits of rdiff - backup .
I know this is an old thread , but these issues are still relevant and not definitively resolved .
I set up rsnapshot as an alternative to my lab 's time machine for a mac os x file server a few weeks ago and have been pretty happy .
Subsequent research has pointed me to rbackup as being even better , but I have n't found many reviews of it yet .
My lab is also considering using a cloud file service like dropbox or google drive for education , but I do n't trust them to keep the only copies of our data .
I 'm considering using them as the primary network drive for non- sensitive data , and having a backup fileserver do pulls from those services and use rbackup to keep snapshots of it .

First off , a letter !
Apologizing for lateness ( of which he also warned me earlier ) but also beautifully introducing the package .
In his own words ---
" So what are you getting ?
2 wine glasses - wth ?
Yes , wine glasses ... not only that , with a bunch of winery logos plastered all over them .
They happen to be a number of good ones up in the Dry Creek Appellation of Sonoma County .
I figured you may need them for the major gifts I 'm giving .
A map of a number of the wineries in Napa Valley .
I live here ... and then chose wine from our neighbor , Sonoma County .
But trust me , it 's good shit .
First off , I got you a bottle of Mietz Claret .
A Claret , in this case , is roughly half Cabernet Sauvignon and half Cab Franc .
All in all , a very good wine and I got the winery owner to sign it ... with a very confused look on her face as she signed it Happy Arbitrary Day .
Second , I got you a bottle of De La Montoya Pin Up Desire .
It 's a good wine with a modern pin-up on the label . "
They look marvelous .
I plan to enjoy one with a friend soon , and perhaps save the other to celebrate Arbitrary Day 2011 .
PARIS — Parisians and tourists enjoying a meal at one of the restaurants in the famous “ Fauchon ” gourmet shop in central Paris might be surprised at the freshness of the honey served with their tea and other meals .
It is fresh and delicious because it comes from the roof of the nearby Paris Opera .
The beehives atop of the Opéra Garnier are just one of an increasing set of hives sprouting atop roofs around Paris in an effort to save bees , their honey , and their impact on our food and environment .
The Opera beehives belong to Jean Paucton , 77 , who still likes to climb up to the rooftop of the Opéra in the center of Paris to visit his bees .
“ Paris is perfect for them , ” Paucton explained .
“ The average temperature during the year is 13 [ degrees Celsius , 55 degrees Fahrenheit ] and there are lots of gardens : the Tuileries , the Luxembourg Gardens , La Villette basin , the Bois de Boulogne … ”
Paucton was not always a beekeeper .
He used to be an Opéra props man .
It was then that he bought his first beehive , and put it on the balcony of his Parisian apartment .
But his neighbors were not too happy .
“ People are afraid of bees but they are actually quite nice , ” Pauchton said .
A friend of his told him to put the hive on the roof of the Opéra so that the bees would not bother anyone anymore .
He did so , and a few weeks later , a friend of a friend came up to take a picture of the beehive .
“ It turned out it was the famous French photographer Yann Arthus - Bertand ! ” Pauchton laughed .
“ The photo was published in the French magazine Paris Match . ”
Paucton ’s rooftop bee - keeping idea has become a trend and now beehives are located all over Paris .
They have taken up residence on the roof of the newly renovated Grand Palais on the Champs Elysée , the brainstorm of beekeeper Nicolas Géant .
“ I went to the team of the Grand Palais with the project and they were enthusiastic , ” recalled young man .
Géant owns a shop where he sells beehives other Parisians .
“ Urban beekeeping is the future of apiculture , ” he said .
“ Most of the beekeepers have taken their hives back to the city because they realized bees were dying 30 percent more in the countryside . ”
It may seem paradoxical but pollution in the countryside is more toxic to bees than in the cities , especially in Paris .
“ For 10 years now , the city of Paris has banned all the chemical products from its gardens , ” Géant explained .
As beekeepers , both Nicolas Géant and Paucton are well aware of the damage caused to the bees by chemical products .
They try to increase the public ’s awareness of their disappearance and its consequences by organizing visits of their beehives .
“ My goal is , and always will be , to make people understand that bees are essential to human beings . ”
Géant said .
The National Union of French Apiculture ( UNAF ) reported recently that 35 percent of food and 65 percent of its diversity directly depend on bees ’ pollination .
The latest data released by the organization is however not optimistic .
Since 1995 , 30 percent of bee colonies have been disappearing every year .
Over the past 10 years , 15,000 professional beekeepers have been forced to stop their activity .
The project entitled “ The bee : Environment sentinel ” launched in December 2005 , proved that the future of beekeeping is urban apiculture .
Beehives have been placed in various French cities to preserve beekeeping and to educate people , including children , who come visit the bees .
Still , there is a tendency to think that the honey made in the city cannot be as good as that harvested in the countryside .
“ They ’re wrong ! ” Géant said .
“ It ’s the opposite ! ” Analyses made on the honey of the Grand Palais showed that there were traces of dandelions in last year ’s harvest .
“ There are lime trees , chestnuts , acacias in Paris .
It ’s a diversity you ca n’t find anywhere else , ” Jean Paucton added .
In the countryside , the honey is made of only one species because of single - crop farming .
That is why the honey of the Opéra is known for its flavor .
The price of that taste is a bit more than $ 18 for barely a quarter of a pound .
In other words : very expensive .
Erica , a young blond girl from Sweden and a customer in the famous “ Fauchon ” restaurant , is attracted to the tiny jars with home - made labels reading “ Harvested from the roof of the Paris Opera . ”
Erica is sold : “ It ’s very Parisian , right ?
It will make a great gift ! ”
The first harvest of the Grand Palais honey , on the contrary , was given to the museum ’s employees and to journalists .
But he 2010 harvest will be the first to be sold at the museum ’s boutique .
“ The earnings will exclusively go to the Grand Palais , ” Géant said .
Back at the Fauchon shop , Anthony , the manager , explained that sometimes people come just for the honey of the Opéra .
“ They know exactly what they want , ” he said .
And rooftop beekeeping is expanding .
Géant recently placed beehives on the roof of the fashionable Louis Vuitton boutique on the Champs Elysées and will place a few others on the top of a tower in La Défense later this year .
Paris may be soon known for its honey and bees as well as for its “ blinding lights . ”
At least at Fauchon , Mary from Ohio knows exactly what she wants : honey “ made in Paris . ”

What is " normal " when it comes to foods ?
Shut up and swallow your Soylent Green
In its never - ending attempt to fabricate " mental disorders " out of every human activity , the psychiatric industry is now pushing the most ridiculous disease they 've invented yet :
This is no joke :
If you focus on eating healthy foods , you 're " mentally diseased " and probably need some sort of chemical treatment involving powerful psychotropic drugs .
The Guardian newspaper reports , " Fixation with healthy eating can be sign of serious psychological disorder " and goes on to claim this " disease " is called orthorexia nervosa -- which is basically just Latin for " nervous about correct eating .
" But they can't just called it " nervous healthy eating disorder " because that does n't sound like they know what they 're talking about .
So they translate it into Latin where it sounds smart ( even though it is n't ) .
That 's where most disease names come from :
Doctors just describe the symptoms they see with a name like osteoporosis ( which means " bones with holes in them " ) .
Getting back to this fabricated " orthorexia " disease , the Guardian goes on to report , " Orthorexics commonly have rigid rules around eating .
Refusing to touch sugar , salt , caffeine , alcohol , wheat , gluten , yeast , soya , corn and dairy foods is just the start of their diet restrictions .
Any foods that have come into contact with pesticides , herbicides or contain artificial additives are also out .
" Wait a second .
Yep .
According to these experts .
If you actually take special care to avoid pesticides , herbicides and genetically modified ingredients like soy and sugar , there 's something wrong with you .
But did you notice that eating junk food is assumed to be " normal ? "
If you eat processed junk foods laced with synthetic chemicals , that 's okay with them .
The mental patients are the ones who choose organic , natural foods , apparently .
I told you this was coming .
Years ago , I warned NaturalNews readers that an attempt might soon be under way to outlaw broccoli because of its anti-cancer phytonutrients .
This mental health assault on health - conscious consumers is part of that agenda .
It 's an effort toby declaring them to be mentally unstable and therefore justify carting them off to mental institutions where they will be injected with psychiatric drugs and fed institutional food that 's all processed , dead and full of toxic chemicals .
The Guardian even goes to the ridiculous extreme of saying , " The obsession about which foods are " good " and which are " bad " means orthorexics can end up malnourished .
" Follow the non-logic on this , if you can : Eating " good " foods will cause malnutrition !
Eating bad foods , I suppose , is assumed to provide all the nutrients you need .
That 's about as crazy a statement on nutrition as I 've ever read .
No wonder people are so diseased today :
The mainstream media is telling them that eating health food is a mental disorder that will cause malnutrition !
It 's just like I reported years ago :
You 're not supposed to question your food , folks .
Sit down , shut up , dig in and chow down .
Stop thinking about what you 're eating and just do what you 're told by the mainstream media and its processed food advertisers .
Questioning the health properties of your junk food is a mental disorder , did n't you know ?
And if you " obsess " over foods ( by doing such things as reading the ingredients labels , for example ) , then you 're weird .
Maybe even sick .
That 's the message they 're broadcasting now .
Junk food eaters are " normal " and " sane " and " nourished . "
But health food eaters are diseased , abnormal and malnourished .
But why , you ask , would they attack healthy eaters ?
People like Dr. Gabriel Cousens can tell you why : Eating junk foods keeps you dumbed down and easy to control , you see .
It literally messes with your mind , numbing your senses with MSG , aspartame and yeast extract .
People who subsist on junk foods are docile and quickly lose the ability to think for themselves .
They go along with whatever they 're told by the TV or those in apparent positions of authority , never questioning their actions or what 's really happening in the world around them .
In contrast to that , people who eat health - enhancing natural foods -- with all the medicinal nutrients still intact -- begin to awaken their minds and spirits .
Over time , they begin to question the reality around them and they pursue more enlightened explorations of topics like community , nature , ethics , philosophy and the big picture of things that are happening in the world .
They become " aware " and can start to see the very fabric of the Matrix , so to speak .
This , of course , is a huge danger to those who run our consumption - based society becausecombined with suggestibility .
For people to keep blindly buying foods , medicines , health insurance and consumer goods , they need to have their higher brain functions switched off .
Processed junk foods laced with toxic chemicals just happens to achieve that rather nicely .
Why do you think dead , processed foods remain the default meals in public schools , hospitals and prisons ?
It 's because dead foods turn off higher levels of awareness and keep people focused on whatever distractions you can feed their brains :
Television , violence , fear , sports , sex and so on .
But that does n't make it normal in my book :
The real " normal " is an empowered , healthy , awakened person nourished with living foods and operating as a sovereign citizen in a free world .
because over time it opens up a whole new perspective on the fabric of reality .
It sets you free to think for yourself .
Butbecause it keeps you trapped in a fabricated reality where your life experiences are fabricated by consumer product companies who hijack your senses with designer chemicals ( like MSG ) that fool your brain into thinking you 're eating real food .
But do n't expect to be popular with mainstream mental health " experts " or dieticians -- they 're all being programmed to consider you to be " crazy " because you do n't follow their mainstream diets of dead foods laced with synthetic chemicals .
But you and I know the truth here :
We are the normal ones .
The junk food eaters are the real mental patients , and the only way to wake them up to the real world is to start feeding them living foods .
Some people are ready to take the red pill , and others are n't .
All you can do is show them the door .
They must open it themselves .
In the mean time , try to avoid the mental health agents who are trying to label you as having a mental disorder just because you pay attention to what you put in your body .
There 's nothing wrong with avoiding sugar , soy , MSG , aspartame , HFCS and other toxic chemicals in the food supply .
In fact , your very life depends on it .

About Clustergrams
In 2002 , Matthias Schonlau published in “ The Stata Journal ” an article named “ The Clustergram : A graph for visualizing hierarchical and .
As explained in the abstract :
In hierarchical cluster analysis dendrogram graphs are used to visualize how clusters are formed .
I propose an alternative graph named “ clustergram ” to examine how cluster members are assigned to clusters as the number of clusters increases .
This graph is useful in exploratory analysis for non-hierarchical clustering algorithms like k-means and for hierarchical cluster algorithms when the number of observations is large enough to make dendrograms impractical .
A similar article was later written and was ( maybe ) published in “ computational statistics ” .
Both articles gives some nice background to known methods like k-means and methods for hierarchical clustering , and then goes on to present examples of using these methods ( with the Clustergarm ) to analyse some datasets .
Personally , I understand the clustergram to be a type of parallel coordinates plot where each observation is given a vector .
The vector contains the observation ’s location according to how many clusters the dataset was split into .
The scale of the vector is the scale of the first principal component of the data .
Clustergram in R ( a basic function )
After finding out about this method of visualization , I was hunted by the curiosity to play with it a bit .
Therefore , and since I did n’t find any implementation of the graph in R , I went about writing the code to implement it .
The code only works for kmeans , but it shows how such a plot can be produced , and could be later modified so to offer methods that will connect with different clustering algorithms .
How does the function work :
The function I present here gets a data .
frame / matrix with a row for each observation , and the variable dimensions present in the columns .
The function assumes the data is scaled .
The function then goes about calculating the cluster centers for our data , for varying number of clusters .
For each cluster iteration , the cluster centers are multiplied by the first loading of the principal components of the original data .
Thus offering a weighted mean of the each cluster center dimensions that might give a decent representation of that cluster ( this method has the known limitations of using the first component of a PCA for dimensionality reduction , but I wo n’t go into that in this post ) .
Finally all of our data points are ordered according to their respective cluster first component , and plotted against the number of clusters ( thus creating the clustergram ) .
My thank goes to Hadley Wickham for offering some good tips on how to prepare the graph .
Here is the code ( example follows )
The R function can be downloaded from here
Corrections and remarks can be added in the comments bellow , or on the github code page .
Example on the iris dataset
The iris data set is a favorite example of many R bloggers when writing about R accessors , Data Exporting , Data importing , and for different visualization techniques .
So it seemed only natural to experiment on it here .
source ( " https://www.r-statistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/source_https.r.txt " )
#
Making sure we can source code from github source_https ( " https://raw.github.com/talgalili/R-code-snippets/master/clustergram.r " ) data( iris ) set.seed ( 250 ) par( cex.lab = 1.5 , cex.main = 1.2 ) Data
Here is the output : Looking at the image we can notice a few interesting things .
We notice that one of the clusters formed ( the lower one ) stays as is no matter how many clusters we are allowing ( except for one observation that goes way and then beck ) .
We can also see that the second split is a solid one ( in the sense that it splits the first cluster into two clusters which are not " close " to each other , and that about half the observations goes to each of the new clusters ) .
And then notice how moving to 5 clusters makes almost no difference .
Lastly , notice how when going for 8 clusters , we are practically left with 4 clusters ( remember - this is according the mean of cluster centers by the loading of the first component of the PCA on the data )
If I where to take something from this graph , I would say I have a strong tendency to use 3 - 4 clusters on this data .
But wait , did our clustering algorithm do a stable job ?
Let 's try running the algorithm 6 more times ( each run will have a different starting point for the clusters ) source ( " https://www.r-statistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/source_https.r.txt " )
#
Making sure we can source code from github source_https ( " https://raw.github.com/talgalili/R-code-snippets/master/clustergram.r " ) set.seed ( 500 ) Data Resulting with : ( press the image to enlarge it ) Repeating the analysis offers even more insights .
First , it would appear that until 3 clusters , the algorithm gives rather stable results .
From 4 onwards we get various outcomes at each iteration .
At some of the cases , we got 3 clusters when we asked for 4 or even 5 clusters .
Reviewing the new plots , I would prefer to go with the 3 clusters option .
Noting how the two " upper " clusters might have similar properties while the lower cluster is quite distinct from the other two .
By the way , the Iris data set is composed of three types of flowers .
I imagine the kmeans had done a decent job in distinguishing the three .
Limitation of the method ( and a possible way to overcome it ?!)
It is worth noting that the current way the algorithm is built has a fundamental limitation :
The plot is good for detecting a situation where there are several clusters but each of them is clearly " bigger " then the one before it ( on the first principal component of the data ) .
For example , let 's create a dataset with 3 clusters , each one is taken from a normal distribution with a higher mean : source ( " https://www.r-statistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/source_https.r.txt " )
#
Making sure we can source code from github source_https ( " https://raw.github.com/talgalili/R-code-snippets/master/clustergram.r " ) set.seed ( 250 ) Data
The resulting plot for this is the following :
The image shows a clear distinction between three ranks of clusters .
There is no doubt ( for me ) from looking at this image , that three clusters would be the correct number of clusters .
But what if the clusters where different but did n't have an ordering to them ?
For example , look at the following 4 dimensional data : source ( " https://www.r-statistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/source_https.r.txt " )
#
Making sure we can source code from github source_https ( " https://raw.github.com/talgalili/R-code-snippets/master/clustergram.r " ) set.seed ( 250 ) Data
In this situation , it is not clear from the location of the clusters on the Y axis that we are dealing with 4 clusters .
But what is interesting , is that through the growing number of clusters , we can notice that there are 4 " strands " of data points moving more or less together ( until we reached 4 clusters , at which point the clusters started breaking up ) .
Another hope for handling this might be using the color of the lines in some way , but I have n't yet figured out how .
Clustergram with ggplot2 Hadley Wickham has kindly played with recreating the clustergram using the ggplot2 engine .
You can see the result here :
http://gist.github.com/439761
And this is what he wrote about it in the comments : I ’ve broken it down into three components :
* run the clustering algorithm and get predictions ( many_kmeans and all_hclust )
* produce the data for the clustergram ( clustergram )
* plot it ( plot.clustergram )
I do n’t think I have the logic behind the y- position adjustment quite right though .
Conclusions ( some rules of thumb and questions for the future )
In a first look , it would appear that the clustergram can be of use .
I can imagine using this graph to quickly run various clustering algorithms and then compare them to each other and review their stability ( In the way I just demonstrated in the example above ) .
The three rules of thumb I have noticed by now are : Look at the location of the cluster points on the Y axis .
See when they remain stable , when they start flying around , and what happens to them in higher number of clusters ( do they re-group together ) Observe the strands of the datapoints .
Even if the clusters centers are not ordered , the lines for each item might ( needs more research and thinking ) tend to move together - hinting at the real number of clusters
Run the plot multiple times to observe the stability of the cluster formation ( and location )
Yet there is more work to be done and questions to seek answers to :
The code needs to be extended to offer methods to various clustering algorithms .
How can the colors of the lines be used better ?
How can this be done using other graphical engines ( ggplot2/ lattice ? ) - ( Update : look at Hadley 's reply in the comments )
: look at Hadley 's reply in the comments )
What to do in case the first principal component does n't capture enough of the data ?
( maybe plot this graph to all the relevant components .
but then - how do you make conclusions of it ? )
What other uses / conclusions can be made based on this graph ?
I am looking forward to reading your input / ideas in the comments ( or in reply posts ) .
There are billions of photos on Flickr , which is a whole lotta pretty to look at .
But , if you ’re a budding photographer , how do you get noticed ?

The single biggest personal finance lesson that anyone can learn is that of delayed gratification .
Delayed gratification means that you hold off buying that new cell phone for a while so that you can pay cash for your car in a few years .
Delayed gratification means that you spend the evening reading a book or learning a new skill instead of merely watching television .
Delayed gratification means that you immediately save some of your paycheck instead of even giving yourself the possibility of spending it now .
The more often you practice delayed gratification , the sweeter the gratification becomes later and the more possibilities unfold in your life .
Delayed gratification brings financial stability and with it , lower stress .
It brings the realization of bigger dreams , too .
It ’s one of the things that I most want to integrate into the lives of my children .
The question is obvious : how do you possibly teach delayed gratification to a four year old ?
Over the last few years , I ’ve been saving little tactics I ’ve heard about here and there for just this purpose and , lately , I ’ve been putting them to work on Joe .
Here are some of the tactics – and how a four year old boy has responded to them .
The Treat Test
I often do this with both Joe and his two year old sister at the same time .
I sit them both down and say , “ Who wants an M&M ? ” ( one of their favorite treats ! )
I then say , “ You have a choice .
You can either have one M&M now – or you can have two M&Ms in three minutes .
Which do you want ? ”
( I ’ve altered the delay a few times . )
My daughter always chooses to have one right away , but she ’s just two .
My son , on the other hand , usually chooses to wait .
Sometimes , if the timeframe is too long , he ’ll ask for it now , but he ’ll usually find something else to do to distract himself until he can have more M&Ms later on .
Mister Noodle
I essentially do a variation on the “ Mister Noodle ” sketch from Sesame Street , in which the children give “ Mister Noodle ” step - by - step instructions on how to complete a task .
Together , we come up with some sort of large project that we want to accomplish .
For example , we might decide that we want to make a giant birthday card for Mom that includes a rainbow and pictures of all of the family members in it .
From there , we go through all of the steps we have to go through to complete the project .
First , we need to get out the supplies , but we need to get all of the supplies out before we move on .
Then , we think about what we ’re going to draw – and perhaps even sketch it out lightly in pencil first .
Once we have the design , we do all of the painting .
Then , if we wish , we add collage elements by looking for the elements we want in old magazines and cutting them out .
We then glue on the collage elements .
We then leave the card out to dry and put all of the supplies away .
If we focused entirely on just our goal , Joe would turn out a lower - quality card than if we focused entirely on each step as we went along .
If we spend some time now delaying the “ gratification ” of slapping paint on the card and instead think about what we want in the end , we wind up with a much better card .
Joe is just now beginning to see the benefits of this type of planning .
I ’ve seen it pop up in his thinking about other things recently , particularly in terms of buidling projects with the Magna - Tiles .
focus on the individual steps towards a long term goal
Visual Savings
One big thing we ’ve done is focus strongly on what we call “ visual savings . ”
As I ’ve mentioned before , we gave our son a
translucent piggy bank for his fourth birthday and instituted a weekly allowance – a small amount of money given to him each week that ’s not tied to any specific chore or action .
He just receives it as a way of learning money management skills .
A portion of that allowance is “ saved ” for a known goal .
He ’ll identify a toy that he wants .
Each week , he saves a portion of his allowance for that toy .
Recently , for example , he had been saving for a particular Iron Man toy .
We identify how much it costs and tell him how much he ’ll have to save up for it .
He puts his allowance in each week and also sometimes adds some “ found money ” to it .
He watches the money build up .
We talk about the toy he ’s saving for and how much it will take to reach that goal .
At first , he was very impatient and would change his goals all the time so that he was saving for a lower - cost toy .
In the last few months , though , he ’s really started to see the benefits of saving for a better toy .
He saved for months for his current Iron Man toy and , for him , the patience really paid off .
Reward Hard Work Instead of Results
My son spent most of an hour picking weeds from our front garden over the weekend .
He did n’t do a perfect job by any means – he missed some weeds and picked a few flowers in the process .
But rather than criticizing his results , I just complimented his efforts .
“ Wow , Joe !
You spent a ton of time weeding and now , because of your hard work , the garden looks great ! ”
I then bent down with him to help him finish and simply showed him which ones were flowers and where some of the missed weeds were , not in any sort of a scolding way , but in a “ Hey , Joe , check this out ! ” kind of way .
The focus is on the effort , not on the results .
I fully intend to do the same thing when he ’s in school .
If I see him studying his school materials , thinking about what he ’s learning , and asking questions related to them , then I know he ’s learning and that earns the praise .
The report card ?
That ’s not nearly as important to me .
But do n’t we want our children to have great results ?
Of course we do , but great results are a reward unto themselves .
Plus , great results are often the endgame of a lot of hard work .
If you ’ve worked hard , you will get great results as a matter of course .
Our focus is in making sure our children learn the value in working hard , not just chase results .
Working hard builds great things .
Chasing results ends up like Wall Street , circa October 2008 .
WOUNDED Australian soldiers Heath Jamieson and Seamus Donaghue will soon be skiing towards the south pole , but on Monday they stood still in London with thousands of others to remember the war dead .
The pair , about to embark on an epic charity trek with Prince Harry , joined recent Victoria Cross recipient Daniel Keighran at the Australian war memorial in Hyde Park .
Corporal Keighran – who last week met the Queen – read the Remembrance Day service ode before a crowd of 100 including High Commissioner Mike Rann .
After , he had a quiet chat with fellow Afghanistan veterans Private Jamieson and Corporal Donaghue reflecting on the lives lost in Europe 100 years ago .
But Pte Jamieson , 35 , and Cpl Donaghue , 30 , will soon be focused solely on supporting survivors of war .
After an official farewell function with Prince Harry on Thursday they ’ll fly to Cape Town and on to Antarctica before trekking 335 km to the south pole to raise funds for wounded soldiers .
Neither had skied before they started training for the three - week adventure 12 months ago .
They ’ll race as part of a mixed Australia - Canadian team against soldiers representing Britain and the United States .
The cross-country contest will be for bragging rights only – which is just as well given their comparative lack of snow skills .
“ It ’s not like we ’ll be fighting tooth - and - nail to get down there first , ” Pte Jamieson told AAP .
“ We did a bit of training in Norway about a month ago and the Norwegians paid us out for our ( poor ) skiing ability . ”

The word PALACE is derived from the Latin name Palātium , for Palatine Hill , one of the seven hills in Rome .
A palace is a grand residence , especially a royal residence or the home of a head of state or some other h
igh - ranking dignitary , such as a bishop or archbishop .
In many parts of Europe , the term is also applied to relatively large urban buildings built as the private mansions of the aristocracy .
Here is a collection of top 10 palaces around the world .
10 . Winter Palace , St. Petersburg , Russia
The Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg , Russia was the official residence of the Russian Tsars .
It was designed by many architects , most notably Bartolomeo Rastrelli , in what came to be known as the Elizabethan Baroque style ; the green - and - white palace has the shape of an elongated rectangle .
The palace has been calculated to contain 1,786 doors , 1,945 windows , 1,500 rooms and 117 staircases .
Its principal façade is 250 m long and 100 ft high .
9. Summer Palace , Beijing , China
The Summer Palace is the largest and best - preserved imperial garden in China .
Its Chinese name , YiHeYuan , translates as ‘ Garden of Nurtured Harmony ’ or ‘ Garden for Maintaining Health and Harmony ’ .
As its name implies , the Summer Palace was used as a summer residence by China ’s imperial rulers – as a retreat from the main imperial palace now known as the Palace Museum ( or ‘ Forbidden City ’ ) – a pleasure ground in the countryside , yet near to the city .
8. Schonbrunn Palace , Vienna , Austria
Schönbrunn Palace is a former imperial summer residence in Vienna , Austria .
Schönbrunn Palace with its surrounding buildings and the huge park is one of the most significant cultural monuments in Austria .
The castle was build to rival French Versailles in Baroque beauty and importance .
7. Potala Palace , Lhasa , Tibet
The Potala Palace , winter palace of the Dalai Lama since the 7th century , symbolizes Tibetan Buddhism and its central role in the traditional administration of Tibet .
The complex , comprising the White and Red Palaces with their ancillary buildings , is built on Red Mountain in the center of Lhasa Valley , at an altitude of 3,700m .
6. Imperial Palace , Tokyo , Japan
Tokyo Imperial Palace is the main residence of the Emperor of Japan .
It is a large park - like area located in Chiyoda , Tokyo close to Tokyo Station and contains various buildings such as the main palace and the private residences of the imperial family .
The total area including the gardens is 7.41 square kilometers .
5. Taj Lake Palace , Udaipur , India
Udaipur , the jewel of Rajasthan , has a regal feeling even in the streets and marketplace , a sense of pride surrounding every shop and square .
Lake Palace ( formerly known as Jag Niwas ) is a luxury hotel , of 83 rooms and suites featuring white marble walls , located on a natural foundation of 4 acres rock , which sits on a private island in the middle of Lake Pichola .
The hotel operates a boat which transports guests to the hotel from a jetty at the City Palace .
4. Dolmabahce Palace , Istanbul , Turkey
The Dolmabahçe Palace in Istanbul , Turkey , located at the European side of the Bosporus , served as the main administrative center of the Ottoman Empire .
The palace is composed of three parts ; the Mabeyn - i Hümâyûn ( the quarters reserved for the men ) , Muayede Salonu ( the ceremonial halls ) and the Harem - i Hümâyûn ( the apartments of the family of the Sultan ) .
The palace has an area of 45,000 m2 , and contains 285 rooms , 46 halls , 6 baths and 68 toilets .
3. Chateau de Versailles , Versailles , France
The Palace of Versailles was the official residence of the Kings of France .
It was originally a hunting lodge , built in 1624 , by Louis XIII .
It was expanded by Louis XIV beginning in 1669 .
He used it as a little lodge as a secret refuge for his amorous trysts with the lovely Louise de la Valliere and built a fairy tale park around it .
Jules Hardouin Mansart , the king ’s principal architect , drew the plans to enlarge what was turning more and more into a palace from A Thousand and One Nights .
2. Buckingham Palace , London
Buckingham Palace is the official London residence of the British monarch .
Located in the City of Westminster , the palace is a setting for state occasions and royal hospitality .
It has been a rallying point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and crisis .
1. Blenheim Palace , Oxfordshire , United Kingdom
Blenheim Palace is home to the 11th Duke and Duchess of Marlborough and the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill .
Set in 2100 acres of beautiful parkland landscaped by ‘ Capability ’ Brown , the magnificent Palace is surrounded by sweeping lawns , award - winning formal gardens and the great Lake , offering a unforgettable day out for all .
Combating crisis conditions on several fronts , President Obama renewed a call to Congress to pass much needed jobs legislation .
In a letter to members of the House and Senate , the president stressed the need to take action now : “ We can not afford to slide backwards just as our recovery is taking hold .
We must take these emergency measures . ”
Powerful corporate interests in Congress however are blocking legislation .
The New York Times claims that some representatives of both parties are holding extension of unemployment benefits hostage to tax cuts for the rich .
In an editorial they said , “ Some senators , including Democrats , have balked at an unrelated provision that would begin to close a tax loophole enjoyed by some of the richest Americans .
You heard right .
Desperately needed unemployment benefits have been held hostage to a tax break for the rich , and the Senate ’s Democratic leadership has had to delay and finagle to get its own caucus in line . ”
The political wrangling has deprived recently 325,000 workers of benefits .
The House of Representatives recently passed a scaled - back jobs package , the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act .
A similar bill remains stalled in the Senate .
The president ’s new push centers on job creation , tax incentives to small business , aid to states facing deficit crisis and a new extension of unemployment benefits .
White House initiatives in this regard have been repeatedly scaled back by Congress .
The AFL - CIO indicated its strong support for job creation and recession fighting legislation , pointing out that if Congress fails to act on unemployment insurance , “ 8.2 million workers will exhaust their benefits by the end of 2010 . ”
The labor federation signaled its support to the recent legislative initiatives of Sens. Max Baucus , D - Mont. , and Sherrod Brown , D - Ohio .
Baucus has proposed financial assistance to states , local infrastructure proposals and extension of unemployment benefits .
Brown has proposed an amendment “ to the appropriations bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that would extend the COBRA subsidy for laid - off workers . ”
However , some conservative Democrats along with Republicans have balked at these and other measures using deficit reduction as an excuse .
“ Late last week , several Democrats said they were unwilling to support the jobs package before the Senate , which includes several administration priorities .
Among them : provisions to revive emergency benefits for unemployed workers , which expired June 2 , as well as $ 24 billion in state aid that Obama has called critical to averting ‘ massive layoffs ’ of public - sector workers . ”
The National Conference of Mayors convention joined the call for federal action on jobs .
Its president , Burnsville , Minn. , Mayor Elizabeth Kautz , said , “ If this country is indeed emerging from a recession as national economists say , many , many people in our cities do n’t feel it .
The jobs picture in our cities is still dire , and we need immediate federal action to make sure the recovery arrives on Main Street . ”
Unemployment figures indicate that “ 148 of the nation ’s 363 metropolitan areas will still have unemployment rates above 10 percent by the end of this year , with 110 metro areas facing double - digit unemployment by the end of 2011 . ”
Economists have warned that a double dip recession is in store if Congress fails to act .

A MELBOURNE man who stabbed three people while surrounded during a fight in the CBD used excessive self - defence , a judge says .
Cory Bricker flashed a knife he was carrying after seeing a group of people fighting near the Crazy Horse adult cinema in Elizabeth
St in the early hours of June 24 , 2008 .
He soon found himself surrounded by the group , the Victorian County Court heard .
A fight began and Bricker was punched .
As he tried to defend himself he stabbed Daniel Langman and 19 - year - old Hope Walter .
Both required hospital treatment , with Ms Walter suffering lacerations to her abdomen and cheek and a wound to her forearm that required surgery .
Bricker fled the fight and was chased by two men to the kitchen of a nearby Subway restaurant .
One of the men threw drink bottles at Bricker and yelled at him that he had stabbed his friend .
Bricker stabbed the man , causing him cuts , the court heard .
Bricker today was sentenced to 236 days in prison , the amount of time he had already served .
Judge Gabriele Cannon said Bricker used the knife in excessive self - defence against a number of aggressive people .
" You were faced with a group greatly outnumbering you , that seemed to be intent on confronting you , '' she said .
" The conduct in which you engaged was excessive self - defence . ''
Judge Cannon said Bricker might well have had a viable defence and had spared the community time and money through his guilty plea .
Bricker , 40 , of Sunshine , pleaded guilty to two counts of recklessly causing serious injury and one count of recklessly causing injury .
He had been convicted of carrying a knife in 2006 , the court heard .
Prosecutors did not submit that Bricker should serve any further jail time .
Secession As Startup : Providing Examples & Competition
When we think of secession , we often think of it as mainly being about regional autonomy for a cultural minority who are being oppressed within a larger state .
The immediate and primary result of such secession is freedom and self - government for that minority .
The United States , for example , was a frontier nation of independent pioneers that had a major culture clash with the distant and aristocratic British , and so they revolted .
The most visible result of that American Revolution was the formation of the United States of America – freedom and self - government for Americans .
Yet there is another way to look at secession , based on the economics of the invisible , where events are like icebergs , their effects mainly lurking beneath the surface .
This way is to look at the long - term consequences that secession has on the entire world .
America did not merely secede and copy the governing documents or style of the United Kingdom .
Rather , it innovated , creating a system based on the English Common Law , yet different , one with explicit checks and balances to restrain government , and with no place for a monarch .
It was an experiment with a more radical form of democracy than existed anywhere in the 18th - century world .
And it was an incredibly successful experiment , as the combination of that innovative rule - set and the empty frontier resulted in America growing rapidly in population , wealth , and influence .
During the open immigration periods of the 19th century , some years saw over a million new immigrants arrive “ yearning to breathe free ” .
As a result , the new American state had influence far beyond its shores .
This influence occured in two major ways .
First , America served as a test of the brand - new American Constitution , and the Founding Fathers ’ philosophy about the role of government .
By showing that it worked well in practice , political philosophers , politicians , voters , and revolutionaries around the world were ( slowly ) convinced that this was the best government technology to be had .
Second , America dramatically outcompeted existing states , based on the simple metric of net migration .
Those million + people a year who went to America can be thought of as customers of government services voting with their feet , which means that other countries were losing market share .
You may not be used to thinking of government in this sort of economic and business framework , but it is a core part of our philosophy here at Let A Thousand Nations Bloom , and we find it provides a unique and refreshing angle on government .
In this case , it shows us the invisible , long - term effects of the American Revolution .
Because , just like any sensible business that loses market share to an upstart competitor , the nations of the world responded .
In many cases by imitating parts of the US that seemed to work – by moving away from monarchy and to more egalitarian , democratic societies .
So it may well be that the greatest effect of the formation of America was on non-Americans !
New ventures ( here in Silicon Valley we call them “ Startups ” ) have the same effect in any industry .
Startups are tests of new ideas ( part of the trial - and - error learning process of the market ) , and when their examples are successful , larger companies take up the ideas .
These larger companies are motivated to do this through the fear of competition – because if they innovate , the startups will grow and take their market share and become the new market leaders .
Thus the startups ’ greatest influence , in the long run , is on the customers of the market leaders – not their direct usefulness to their own customers .
Trial and error and the growth of what works and ending of what does n’t is how a healthy industry works , and for awhile , the government industry worked that way .
Unfortunately , for a variety of reasons ( running out of new land , countries joining into large federations , citizens less willing to engage in revolution ) , there is n’t much room for startup governments any more .
So we lack new experiments which could find us new government technologies that might be as much better as today ’s democracies as the US Constitution was compared to the awkward monarchy / democracy hybrids of the time .
And that is why we care about secession and related topics – because the world needs startup governments to make progress .

Migration
Wrap-up
The console itself may be an attractive package , but Microsoft really skimped on the extras this time round .
While we did n't expect the new wireless controller to add anything more than a coat of gloss black ( sorry , fighting fans , it 's the same ol ' D - pad ) , we 're surprised you do n't get HD playback out of the box .
Where the Xbox 360 Elite came with not only a switchable component / composite HD A/V cable but an HDMI cord to boot , the new Xbox 360 has only a set of composite wires that do n't support even 480 p resolution .
If you expected the new Xbox 360 to be any faster , you 're mostly out of luck -- the silicon 's clocked at the same speed , for starts , and the 250GB hard drive was neck and neck with the Elite 's 120 GB during a battery of tests , like this 4.6GB Street Fighter IV install .
The new Xbox 360 sadly does n't have gigabit ethernet to speed networking up , but we did get favorable results out of the 802.11n
WiFi card .
Compared to a 100 megabit wired connection on a neighboring Elite , the wireless posted slightly more erratic transfer rates and was occasionally susceptible to lag , but still averaged 1.7MB / sec downloads ( compared to 1.9MB / sec ) on a fast AT&T U - Verse connection -- we 'd certainly be happy with most games ( save fighters ) over wireless .
The one place the new Xbox 360 did show considerable improvement was the optical disc drive -- the Stealthbox consistently loaded DVDs and game levels two seconds faster -- but we 'd hesitate to recommend the system on that basis alone , as historically Microsoft has shipped consoles with a variety of different drives .
We 'd already heard the new Valhalla was pretty dang power - friendly , but that did n't keep us from performing a few tests of our own -- and sure enough , it 's the most energy efficient unit we 've seen .
While it still draws a tad more current than a PS3 Slim , playing games and DVDs require fewer watts , and as you can plainly see in the chart above , it wipes the floor with our Elite .
The Stealthbox is just as " whisper quiet " as Microsoft promised , too -- though it 's definitely audible when playing games from DVD , the system 's blissfully silent as long as you first install them to the hard drive .
The only thing amiss was the electromagnetic signature we detected when firing our infrared temperature gun -- you 'd think that using less energy , the console would generate less heat , but our unit was often burning hot to the touch .
Given Microsoft 's storied history of hardware failure , we 'd never think of leaving an Xbox in a cabinet or stacked with other A/V components and that has n't changed one bit with this model .
If you 're buying an Xbox for the very first time , data migration wo n't concern you in the least , but on the off - chance you 're thinking of springing for a new system you should know that , and we thought we 'd include this brief guide .
There are now three ways to move your data over , assuming you do n't want to download it all again : USB , the transfer cable , or by simply sticking in your old hard drive .
USB is the cheapest way to move content by far -- just insert an USB thumbdrive or external HDD , and the Xbox can partition up to 16GB worth of storage .
Thing is , you can't move savegames and DLC a la carte , as your profile always has to come along for the ride .
If you 've only got a small USB key , it could take ages to ferry everything over .
The Xbox 360 Hard Drive Data Migration Transfer Kit ( yes , that 's seriously the full name ) makes things easier , as you can move an entire drive 's worth of content in one fell swoop , but it costs $ 20 at retail .
Thankfully , Microsoft made these practically disposable a few years back in what used to be single - use transfer kits , and you can find the now - bidrectional cables for pennies on eBay .
Last but not least , as we just discovered , you can simply rip open your old Xbox 360 hard drive and slot it into the case , at which point it will be immediately recognized .
Needless to say , we do n't recommend this route for a variety of reasons ... we hear Microsoft 's warranty support service does n't take kindly to freely bouncing hard drives .
The new Xbox 360 is a sleek , stylish contraption , shiny black from head to cords , but it does n't offer quite enough to make it an obvious upgrade for those who 've bought one before .
If the screeching cries of your existing unit are driving you up the wall , or if you need a more energy efficient system with integrated wireless , sure , but if you 've already invested in the Xbox ecosystem , purchased add - on hard drives and more , you 'll find little to justify the $ 300 price -- until your existing console throws the dreaded RRoD , or perhaps an E74 .
That said , this is the best Xbox 360 ever made , bar none , and if you 've yet to join the Xbox party -- and do n't mind springing for an HDMI cable -- this is definitely the one .
While our Xbox 360 Elite came with HDMI and component A/V cables we 've been informed that Microsoft has since stopped shipping HD - capable cables with new Elite models .
We have updated the comparison chart to reflect that .
If Israel does indeed follow through with this , this could be a major breakthrough for getting humanitarian aid to Gaza Palestinians :
JERUSALEM —
While still insisting that its blockade of Gaza is essential to its security , the Israeli government is now shifting its position , “ exploring new ways ” of allowing goods to reach the coastal enclave , an Israeli official said Thursday .
Describing the latest thinking within the government on the condition of anonymity , because he was not authorized to discuss it publicly , the official said Israel was determined to have every ship heading to Gaza inspected to prevent the smuggling of rockets and other weapons .
But at the same time , he said , the government wanted to facilitate the entry of civilian goods .
The government ’s new flexibility follows a week of unrelenting international outrage over Israel ’s commando raid on a flotilla of pro-Palestinian activists , which left nine dead , and reports that senior officials in the Obama administration were calling for a “ new approach ” in Gaza and had concluded that the blockade was untenable .
President Obama added to the pressure on Israel in an interview with Larry King that was broadcast Thursday night .
While declining to condemn the raid , he said , “ What ’s important right now is that we break out of the current impasse , use this tragedy as an opportunity so that we figure out how we meet Israel ’s security concerns , but at the same time start opening up opportunity for Palestinians . ”

Image caption Icelanders are aware that their volcanic ash has hurt the country 's image
First the Icesave bank left savers out of pocket , then a volcano spread ash across Europe , grounding flights - but now Iceland is fighting back .
The Icelandic government has thrown its weight behind an internet campaign to brighten up the country 's image .
Icelanders have gone online en masse , to tell the world how much they love their country .
Thursday's " Iceland Hour " was aimed at kick - starting Icelandic tourism , following many cancellations .
The head of the " Inspired by Iceland " internet campaign , Einar Karl Haraldsson , told BBC News that tens of thousands of e-cards had been sent between 1300 and 1400 GMT .
He said half a million people had viewed the videos on the campaign website and " there have been two million hits on Twitter " , the popular social network .
" We can already say there has been an enormous response , " he said .
Mr Haraldsson , an aide to Iceland 's tourism minister , said tourist bookings were " better than ever " before the eruption of Eyjafjallajokull in April , but then slumped by about 15 % .
The volcano spewed out clouds of ash , which led to airlines grounding their planes for fear it could damage jet engines .
It was the biggest shutdown of airspace in Europe since World War II , and affected at least 10 million passengers worldwide .
The Icelandic Foreign Ministry said the 320,000 inhabitants of the world 's northernmost nation were encouraged to " go online and send messages to friends around the globe about what they like most about Iceland " .

BBC News
National flags are everywhere .
Watercooler chat is of little else .
And then there are all those e-mails inviting you to join the office sweepstake .
It 's not hard to spot the signs , even for a football refusenik .
There are those who begin the countdown to the next World Cup almost as soon as the new champions hoist the trophy aloft .
And then there are those who only clock that it's that time again at the last minute .
So what are the indications that a global football tournament is about to begin ?
1. NEW WORDS ENTER THE LEXICON
In 2002 , the word " metatarsal " suddenly entered the mainstream , such was the focus on David Beckham 's broken foot .
Four years later , the wives and girlfriends ' ostentatious stint in Baden - Baden , Germany , brought the nickname Wag into common parlance .
2006 - era Wags Adrian Beard , author of the Language of Sport , says certain words tend to catch on because of cultural repetition and " playfulness " with language .
" The interesting thing about metatarsal is we had a specialist medical term being applied to a highly non-medical group of people .
It got to the stage where Rooney and Beckham were almost defined by the term , " he says .
It 's hard to predict which words will spring from the South African tournament as language reacts to , rather than sets , the agenda .
" It will probably emerge - in terms of England coverage - from key figures in the team , who they are playing and where they are playing .
But sometimes we get quite a creative blend of words .
Because the World Cup is in South Africa , words from Afrikaans might come into play too . "
But there is a huge repertoire for play , and not just with language .
" After all , who could predict the Mexican wave in 1986 or Johan Cruyff 's famous turn in 1974 ? "
2 . SUPERMARKET QUEUES BEFORE KICK -OFF . and empty streets during big games .
Retailers dub this " World Cup rush hour " - those frantic pre-match minutes when fans rush to stock up on beer and snacks .
Supermarkets are well - versed in the phenomenon , and profit from it with beer promotions focused around those twin pastimes of watching footie and barbecuing meat .
Malcolm Pinkerton , senior analyst at retail analyst Verdict , says the World Cup always boosts sales of convenience and party foods , helped by special offers .
While it is hard to quantify how much supermarket spending is directly related to the tournament , it is estimated that in 2006 , about £ 1.25 bn was spent on World Cup - related products in Britain .
" People might be watching the game on one day at the weekend , which will take trade away from the High Street , " says Mr Pinkerton .
" But it 's a mixed bag , because there could be a pent - up demand , with lots of people wanting to go shopping the day after or the following weekend . "
3 . EXPANDING WAISTLINES
Playing football may be good for the health .
Watching it , on the other hand , can pile on the pounds .
Men 's
Health magazine estimates a die - hard World Cup fan could gain 2st and 7lb ( 15.7kg ) if they watch every game between 11 June and 11 July .
TV and grazing go hand in hand
It bases this gain on the assumption that a British man watching a game with friends will drink , on average , four cans of lager and eat three slices of a pizza , half a bag of nacho chips and half a pot of dip - adding up to 1,913.5 kcal .
That 's two - thirds of the recommended daily calorie intake for men , and almost the entire daily intake for women .
In contrast , the energy expended while watching - even accounting for gesticulating , shouting and leaping to one 's feet every so often - is just 215.5 kcals .
More realistically , a less dedicated football fan who only watches the seven possible England games - providing the team reaches the final - could put on just over 3lb ( 1.72kg ) .
4 . UNLIKELY FOOTBALL FANS Normally , football and churchgoing are not synonymous .
But the World Cup fuses a spiritual bond between two very different Sunday activities .
In Hexham , Northumberland , the Reverend David Flavell has put up giant TV screens in the Trinity Methodist Church so his congregation can watch England matches en masse , in a smoke and alcohol - free " family friendly " atmosphere .
" We 're using the football theme to get the Gospel message across , " says Mr Flavell , who has tailored his sermons accordingly .
Elsewhere , the Bishop of Croydon , the Right Reverend Nick Baines , has written a series of " football prayers " which call for those in the tournament to be " guided , guarded and protected " .
And should it all go wrong on the day , there is even a prayer for England fans : " Lord , as all around are gripped with World Cup fever , bless us with understanding , strengthen us with patience and grant us the gift of sympathy if needed .
Amen . "
5 . CHICK FLICKS ON TV A tidal wave of football - focused television is about to break .
In the 2006 World Cup , an estimated 376 channels worldwide broadcast the event , generating 73,072 hours of matches , build - ups and punditry .
" If all the 2006 coverage were shown on just one channel , it would take over eight years to broadcast non-stop , " says a Fifa spokesman .
But there are words of comfort for footie - averse viewers from Jonathan Bowman , editor of TV and Satellite week .
" With digital broadcasting there is now plenty of choice .
Channels that wo n't be showing the World Cup are making deliberate efforts to target non-football fans - like Channel 4 starting Big Brother early or Living TV's new series of Britain 's Next Top Model . "
And those that do show games have tailored their schedules accordingly .
" You 'll notice the absence of high - profile series on BBC One and ITV .
That 's because , as the World Cup progresses , you can't predict which channel gets to show which play - off .
" So no football - showing channel wants to commit to an expensive drama series , because episodes would have to be postponed to make way for an important match . "
And female - friendly films and shows are often scheduled against the big games .
For Saturday 's clash between England and the United States on ITV , C4 screens back - to - back Come Dine With Me episodes followed by Sense and Sensibility .
And for the England v Algeria match next Friday , the BBC charts Queen Victoria 's love life while Five has a Kevin Costner romance .
6 . EMPTY DESKS
Companies will be bracing themselves for Wednesday 23 June , a red - letter day for pulling a sickie .
This is when England play their last first round match against Slovenia at 3 pm .
AND it is the third day of Wimbledon .
Is one flag ever enough ?
Better news for employers is that absenteeism could be limited due to England 's other first round matches scheduled for the evening or weekend .
However , experts say the World Cup could dent productivity in other ways .
With a vast number of football - themed websites and chatrooms , many fans may find they spend more and more time online during work hours .
Employment law expert Joe Shelston estimates lost time could have cost UK firms as much as £ 4bn during the 2006 World Cup .
But Gert de Beer , of Deloitte , suggests ways employers can work with , rather than against the World Cup , such as flexible hours and screening rooms on site .
An employee perception survey among 500 Deloitte 's South African employees showed people were even willing to work longer hours if they could watch some matches during work time .
7 . RISE OF THE INSTANT EXPERT
Suddenly the most unlikely people - who normally would n't be caught dead watching Match of the Day - have an opinion , on Capello 's defensive strategy .
And watercooler conversations once taken up with the finer points of EastEnders now centre on whether there is indeed a curse of the captain .
Football is not a subject you need to have any academic qualifications to talk about
Dr Mark Griffiths
The phenomenon of the instant expert is partly down to insecurities about " not belonging " , says psychologist and football expert Dr Mark Griffiths , of Nottingham Trent University .
" Everybody wants to belong and because everyone else seems to be following the World Cup , it 's natural that you will want to join in - even if you do n't normally follow the game .
Otherwise you risk being left out of the office conversation .
" But there are other factors that help - football is not a subject you need to have any academic qualifications to talk about , so it 's easy to be an expert - or appear to be one , albeit not under particularly close scrutiny .
" Also , the World Cup gives everybody a chance to get behind their national teams and express their patriotism .
It 's a powerful unifying event . "
But because it only comes around every four years , chances are many of today 's experts will lose interest once the final whistle blows - just as tennis courts suddenly fill for the two weeks of Wimbledon .
" If people do n't normally follow the game , their expertise is likely to be a fairly short - lived experience , " he says .
" Chances are they 'll soon be back to talking about EastEnders once the World Cup is over . "
8 . DREADFUL FOOTBALL SONGS
There 's no official World Cup single , which means a flood of releases from rival songs seeking football anthem status , including : Will Mr Rascal win the battle of the World Cup singles ?
England 's On The Way , Neil " Men Behaving Badly / Bob the Builder " Morrissey 's reworking of 1982 hit The Lion Sleeps Tonight .
It 's already been rendered out - of - date with lyrics such as : " Rio , Ashley and Big John Terry - three lions score tonight ! "
We Are The England Fans , Black " Agadoo " Lace 's reversioning of their party hit I Am The Music Man
Three Lions , rerecorded by David Baddiel , Frank Skinner and Ian Broudie - of the Lightning Seeds - with Robbie Williams and Russell Brand on guest vocals
Roar for England , by Deepak Khazanchi , the first bhangra - flavoured England song
And Shout , Dizzee Rascal and James Corden 's rap reworking of the Tears For Fears ' hit With a high profile appearance on last Saturday 's Britain 's Got Talent final , and much exposure in the tabloid newspapers , the duo - backed by Simon Cowell - are being tipped for the number one slot by this Sunday .
9 . ST GEORGE'S CROSS ON EVERYTHING
Not only are England flags much in evidence - more on that below - but the red and white livery crops up all over the place .
Perhaps not for the Scottish market Because the beautiful game is far more than a sporting contest , it is a marketing opportunity of the highest order .
It 's not just Fifa 's official sponsors and partners - such as Coca - Cola , Adidas , Visa and McDonald 's - who stand to benefit , says Graham Hales of Interbrand .
The clever brands are those which manage to associate themselves in the public mind with the World Cup , by successfully linking their products to the feel - good factor of an international sporting event .
It 's why Mars , official sponsor of the England team , now - literally - wrap their bars in the cross of St George .
10 . PROLIFERATION OF FLAGS
They flutter on cars and vans , are draped from the windows of homes and pubs , and flag bunting bedecks the streets .
Even David Cameron has announced the red-and - white St George 's cross is to fly above Downing Street for the duration of the World Cup .
Going large in support Chris Deegan , of Turtle and Pearce - one of the UK 's oldest flag manufacturers - has noticed a big upsurge in demand for St George flags , mainly from companies who want to fly the national colours over their corporate HQs .
Among recent orders are flags for the Ritz and Claridges hotels .
While the twin - packs of flags for car windows are imported " by the container load " from China , his George flags are made from Admiralty - approved cloth and individually sewn from seven separate pieces - and are priced accordingly .
Among those splashing out hundreds is James Yeoman , landlord of the Willow Tree in Winchester , who has draped a floor - to - ceiling St George 's flag over the pub entrance , with a slit in the middle for customers to walk though .
It will stay in place until England is out of the World Cup .
" It 's always good to show your support for England - we just wanted to be bigger and better , " says Mr Yeoman .
Whatever the size , the sentiments remain the same , says Chris Deegan .
" It 's about showing which team you support , and also a statement of national pride . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
Even my local takeaway in Chorlton village has made up their own England team .
We now have Wayne ' Roogan Josh ' upfront , supported by Jermain ' Dofeaza ' and Frank ' Lamb Parsanda ' in midfield to name but a few .
The whole team has been named after curries .

In Scotland you can tell the World Cup is on as there is an upsurge in the wearing of Scotland tops and flags even though we 're not in it .
This is to counter the endless references to England ( and 1966 in particular ) on TV and everywhere else .

It means my mum gets a refresher course in the basics of the game and a wall chart of her own .

It seems that all the programmes I like are being held over until after the football is over - serious documentaries being the principal victims .
More mature viewers and gossip - haters are simply not being catered for .
Thank goodness it will be light late and I can go out with my camera , or sit in the garden with a good book .

Yesterday we had it confirmed that Shogun 2 : Total War is to come out next year .
Today we have the first trailer .
Where “ trailer ” means , “ a man sticking a knife in a map . ”
So there ’s some analysis of what this could mean below .
There ’s also some rather lovely promotional art stuff that you can enjoy .
Before we dissect this , it ’s worth watching the trailer in full .
So here you go :
What are the implications of these details released by Sega and Creative Assembly ?
I ’d argue they are three - fold .
1 ) A Man : A man is very likely to appear as a character within the game .
Perhaps this man , seemingly of Japanese origins , may be a character against whom you fight .
Or perhaps he could be the man you fight as .
Maybe he offers advice to you as you play ?
Or perhaps he is simply a beard to aim for .
2 ) A Map : Maps have formed an essential part of strategy gaming for years , so perhaps this simple hand - drawn map is an indication from CA that they do not intend to deviate from this in their new game .
While we cannot infer there definitely will be a map in the game , I ’m willing to predict that map fans wo n’t be disappointed .
3 ) A Knife : Knives wielded by men have often been used throughout cultural history to denote the penis .
Here we see an angry man waving his knife / penis in his hand , then stabbing it into the map .
It is reasonable to infer that this represents the man ’s desire to “ fuck ” the map .
In representing sex in this violent fashion , where the map / vagina is penetrated by the knife / penis , we are made aware that this man intends to impose his will upon the lands represented in the map .
In this sense he is aiming to “ conquer ” them .
In conclusion , the angry man wants to have sex with a map .
Shogun 2 : Total War comes out in 2011 .
Pee -wee Herman ’s comeback began with a stage show , and quickly moved on to Leno appearance and Twitter debut .
And now his revival is ascending to even greater heights .
Paul Reubens will work with Judd Apatow on an untitled Pee- wee Herman feature that Reubens will write with Paul Rust ( Inglorious Basterds and I Love You , Beth Cooper ) .
Apatow will produce - but not direct - the project , which he believes will provide humans an important service .
“ Let ’s face it , the world needs more Pee - wee Herman , ” Apatow said .
“ I am so excited to be working with Paul Reubens – who is an extraordinary and groundbreaking actor and writer .
It ’s so great to watch him return with such relevance . ”
The movie ’s plot will see Herman on a road trip taking part in a “ gigantic adventure , ” probably with Seth Rogen and Christopher Mintz - Plasse as his neurotic buddies who are scared of girls and do n’t want to deal with the realities of life .

Londonderry will try to lay part of its unquiet history to rest later this month when two events coincide : the city 's final representation in its attempt to be named UK City of Culture and the report of the Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday .
Poignantly , a central part of the city 's bid will be the £ 6 m conversion of what was formerly Ebrington Barracks into a multi-venue arts centre .
In its previous incarnation this was the military headquarters that co-ordinated British paratroopers alleged to have killed 13 young Irish men , five of them teenagers , during a civil rights demonstration in the Catholic Bogside area in 1972 .
The Saville report will be published on 15 June ; and the bid – which points the way to a hopeful future – will be made a day later .
For the three decades after Bloody Sunday – 30 January 1972 – the 1,000 British troops garrisoned in Ebrington were , in effect , under siege .
But by summer 2011 , Ebrington , ceded to the Office of the First Minister of Northern Ireland in 2004 when the Army finally left , will be an arts centre .
The former parade ground , today still with its helicopter landing markings , will become an open - air performance space bigger than Trafalgar Square .
On its east side , the main Clocktower GHQ building will be a major contemporary art gallery , extended with a naturally lit gallery at its rear ; negotiations with the Tate for a long - term collaboration are near completion .
On the square 's north side , the former military hospital will be a museum and archive centre .
On the south side will be studios , cafés , bars and a sports centre .
On Ebrington 's western edge a new £ 13.4 m footbridge , paid for by the EU 's Shared Space Programme , is being erected across the Foyle .
It will open at the end of this year as the Peace Bridge , in defiance of the area 's long history of division .
As a 12 - year - old in 1971 , living in Waterside , Brendan McMenamin could wander in and out of Ebrington , where he was taught how to use a Lee Enfield rifle by friendly soldiers , but within a few months that neighbourliness ended .
Mr McMenamin is now Londonderry 's arts officer .
" This is a small city of little more than 100,000 people , and it's also Ireland 's youngest , " he says .
" Thirty - seven per cent of the population are under 35 and it has become diverse , with over 100 different communities .
Most of Derry were n't born on Bloody Sunday or have come to live here since .
We want Saville to put all that behind us . "
The Museum of Free Derry opened three years ago in the Bogside with objects from those involved in the civil rights movement of the Sixties and Seventies .
It is run by volunteers , including John Kelly , whose brother Michael was , at 17 , the youngest casualty on Bloody Sunday .
" I see my brother 's death as a human rights issue , not sectarian , " Mr Kelly says .
" Saville is about setting the truth free and we want a declaration of innocence for our people .
I 'm a Derry man , never left the place and I love it , but it 's a major city and we want it to be City of Culture , not for the old history but for the new . "

Alpha Protocol apparently performed too poorly to receive a sequel , but developer Obsidian wo n't be put down .
In fact , it wants to get involved with Chrono Trigger , arguably one of the most beloved RPG names of all time .
Apparently , the studio was in talks with Square Enix regarding a game , so this is a thing that might happen .
“ We were talking to Square for quite awhile , ” says CEO Feargus Urquhart .
“ You make RPGs , we make RPGs , it would be great to see what we could do together .
And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs .
And , so it kind of all ended up fitting together . ”
Obsidian is currently making Dungeon Siege 3 for Square Enix and I simply hope it fares better than Alpha Protocol did .
You know , in that I hope it 's actually good .
While we wait to see how that game fares , what would you say to an Obsidian - developed Chrono Trigger ?
Would that even work , do you think ?

The developers say that the update includes fixes for several security issues and advise all users to upgrade to the latest release as soon as possible .
However , the OpenOffice.org Security Team Bulletin , has yet to be updated with details of the vulnerabilities .
According Florian Effenberger , the OpenOffice.org Marketing Project Leader , further details on the security fixes will be announced " in a few days " .
More details about the release can be found in the release announcement and release notes .

The drawings , which emerged at the Comic - Con event in San Diego , also include Simpsons versions of the Tardis , a Weeping Angel and a Dalek .
Sources at the BBC have reportedly admitted that they are " impressed " with the pictures but also insisted that there are currently no plans for a crossover .
" It 's great that people in the US love Matt and Karen , " one insider said .
" Getting the two iconic shows together is a fun idea .
But it 's not something in the pipeline at the moment . "

Two historical figures -- the legendary warrior - monk Benkei ( left ) and the warrior Ushiwakamaru , a.k.a.
Minamoto no Yoshitsune ( right ) -- have emerged in a pair of fields in the Aomori prefecture town of Inakadate .
For nearly 20 years , the town has prided itself as home to Japan 's finest rice crop art , which is created by carefully arranging different colors of rice plants in the field .

In 37 - plus seasons as owner , Steinbrenner led the Yankees to seven World Series championships , 11 American League pennants and 16 AL East titles .
" He was and always will be as much of a New York Yankee as Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio , Mickey Mantle , Yogi Berra , Whitey Ford and all of the other Yankee legends , " baseball commissioner Bud Selig said .
" Although we would have disagreements over the years , they never interfered with our friendship and commitment to each other .
Our friendship was built on loyalty and trust and it never wavered . "
New York was 11 years removed from its last championship when he headed a group that bought the team from CBS Inc. on Jan. 3 , 1973 , for about $ 10 million .
He revolutionized the franchise -- and sports -- by starting his own television network and ballpark food company .
Forbes now values the Yankees at $ 1.6 billion , trailing only Manchester United ( $ 1.8 billion ) and the Dallas Cowboys ( $ 1.65 billion ) .
" He was an incredible and charitable man , " his family said in a statement .
" He was a visionary and a giant in the world of sports .
He took a great but struggling franchise and turned it into a champion again . "
The Steinbrenner family said that funeral arrangements will be private ; however , details about an additional public service will be announced at a later date .
Flags were lowered to half - staff at New York 's City Hall and a marquee outside the $ 1.5 billion Yankee Stadium -- " the house that George built " -- honored " George M. Steinbrenner III , 1930 - 2010 . "
He ruled with obsessive dedication to detail , overseeing everything from trades to the air blowers that kept his ballparks spotless .
He admittedly was overbearing , screaming at all from commissioners to managers to secretaries .
His reign was interrupted for suspensions , including a 15 - month ban in 1974 after his guilty plea to conspiring to make illegal contributions to President Richard Nixon 's re-election campaign .
He was pardoned 15 years later by President Ronald Reagan .
Steinbrenner 's death on the day of the All - Star Game was the second in three days to rock the Yankees .
Bob Sheppard , the team 's revered public address announcer from 1951 to 2007 , died Sunday at 99 .
The Yankees said they will wear patches on their uniforms honoring the memory of Steinbrenner and Sheppard .
The Steinbrenner patch will be worn above the interlocking NY on the pinstriped home uniform and above the " York " on the road grays .
The patch commemorating Sheppard will be worn on the left sleeve of the home and away uniforms .
A video tribute was shown at the All - Star Game and players bowed their heads during a moment of silence before the national anthem was played at Angel Stadium .
The Yankees wore black armbands , and the U.S. , Canadian and California flags were lowered to half - staff .
" It 's a difficult time , on a great day for baseball , the All - Star Game , something everyone looks to , " Yankees and AL manager Joe Girardi said .
" A great man in baseball passed .
He 's meant so much to not only this organization , but to the game of baseball , and to all of us personally . "
The son of a shipping magnate , Steinbrenner lived up to his billing as " The Boss , " a nickname he earned and clearly enjoyed as he ruled with an iron fist .
While he lived in Tampa he was a staple on the front pages of New York newspapers .
" He was truly the most influential and innovative owner in all of sports , " former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said .
" He made the Yankees a source of great pride in being a New Yorker . "
Steinbrenner 's mansion , on a leafy street in an older neighborhood of south Tampa , was quiet Tuesday .
Private security guards milled around on the empty circular driveway inside the gates .
A police officer turned away reporters along the narrow street .
News vehicles lined the other side of the street .
" The passing of George Steinbrenner marks the end of an era in New York City baseball history , " rival Mets owners Fred and Jeff Wilpon and Saul Katz said .
" George was a larger - than - life figure and a force in the industry . "
Steinbrenner was known for feuds , clashing with Berra and hiring manager Billy Martin five times while repeatedly fighting with him .
But as his health declined , Steinbrenner let sons Hal and Hank run more of the family business .
Steinbrenner was in fragile health for years , resulting in fewer public appearances and pronouncements .
Yet dressed in his trademark navy blue blazer and white turtleneck , he was the model of success .
" Few people have had a bigger impact on New York over the past four decades than George Steinbrenner , " Mayor Michael Bloomberg said .
" George had a deep love for New York , and his steely determination to succeed combined with his deep respect and appreciation for talent and hard work made him a quintessential New Yorker . "
He appeared at the new Yankee Stadium just four times : the 2009 opener , the first two games of last year 's World Series and this year 's home opener , when captain Derek Jeter and Girardi went to his suite and personally delivered his seventh World Series ring .
" He was very emotional , " said Hal Steinbrenner , his father 's successor as managing general partner .
Jeter said Tuesday that Opening Day was the last time he saw George Steinbrenner .
" I think he 's a father figure to everyone that was in our organization in the past or present , because he really took care of his players , " Jeter said .
" I remember my first , second year , I was on third base and got doubled off on a line drive in the infield and we won the game .
After the game he was yelling at me for , ' Do n't ever get doubled off again .
We won the game , but he expected perfection , and that rubbed off .
And whether it was the players , the front office , the people working at the stadium , did n't make a difference .
He expected perfection . "
Until the end , Steinbrenner demanded championships .
He barbed Joe Torre during the 2007 AL playoffs , then let the popular manager leave after another loss in the opening round .
The team responded last year by winning another title .
" I will always remember George Steinbrenner as a passionate man , a tough boss , a true visionary , a great humanitarian , and a dear friend , " Torre said .
" It 's only fitting that he went out as a world champ . "
ANCHORAGE , Alaska , July 22 ( UPI ) --
An Alaskan man has been charged with intentionally ramming his jet boat into breaching humpback whales in the state 's southeast waters , authorities said .
Kevin B. Carle , 44 , was charged with a federal misdemeanor for violating the Endangered Species Act by " knowingly harassing , pursuing and harming whales , " the Anchorage Daily News reported Thursday .

Prosecutors say Carle was piloting a 34 - foot jet boat used to ferry loggers between logging camps and Craig , Alaska , in April 2008 when the first collision took place .
He rammed a second whale in September of that year , prosecutors allege .
Authorities would not say why they thought Carle rammed the whales .
" I would not even want to speculate on the motive , " Julie Speegle , a spokeswoman for NOAA Fisheries in Alaska , said .
" Suffice it to say that , according to a witness , it was intentional . "
A plea agreement calls for Carle to plead guilty in exchange for two years probation and a $ 1,000 fine , the Daily News reported .
La muerte de Horacio Adrián Gil ( 40 ) en Mysore , India , el 5 de febrero pasado sorprendió a familiares y amigos .
Pero la conmoción fue aún mayor cuando el cuerpo llegó a Argentina : estaba embalsamado y le faltaban los órganos .
“ Chicho ” , como lo conocían en San Telmo , había salido del país el 15 de diciembre de 2009 .
Hablaba inglés , francés y chino ( “ le gustaba mucho la cultura Oriental ” , recuerda su amigo Gustavo Celedoni ) y llegó a la India el 12 de enero .
No está claro que pasó la noche de su muerte : fue a un bar , tomó algo con un amigo inglés y se fue a dormir .
Ya de madrugada , el inglés notó que le costaba respirar y llamó a una ambulancia , pero Gil falleció camino al hospital .
La causa fue caratulada como “ muerte dudosa ” , aunque luego la autopsia que se le practicó en la India determinó que había fallecido por una isquemia .
Los familiares denuncian que es incompleta , y por eso esperan la llegada de las muestras de hígado , riñón , pulmón y corazón para hacer una segunda autopsia .
“ No sabemos qué pasó con él , si fue víctima del tráfico de órganos o si se los sacaron para que no se sepa de qué murió ” , dice la mamá , María Inés Loréfice .
“ Desde Cancillería no nos dan respuesta .
Hace un mes que no tenemos noticias ” , se queja .
Fuentes de Cancillería dijeron a Clarín que “ se prestó y se sigue prestando toda la asistencia consular del caso ” .

An Irish - owned boat laden with humanitarian supplies is continuing its journey towards Gaza despite Israel ’s insistence it will not allow any vessel break its blockade on the territory .
The MV Rachel Corrie , which has five Irish citizens aboard , including Nobel peace laureate Mairéad Corrigan - Maguire and former UN official Denis Halliday , is currently in Libyan waters some 640 km ( 400 miles ) from Gaza .
The Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign tonight dismissed some reports that the boat was due to dock in Turkey and insisted it intends to maintain course with no stops until it reaches the Gazan port .
The boat , which is captained by Eric Harcis , is travelling at approximately 402 kms ( 250 miles ) a day and expects to reach Gaza by Saturday .
Film - maker Fiona Thompson from Dundalk and husband and wife Derek and Jenny Graham from Co Mayo are also on board .
“ I spoke to Derek and he said they were going full throttle towards Gaza , ” Freda Hughes from the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign said today .
“ Originally the boat was lagging behind the rest of the flotilla , now it looks like the one surviving member that might get to Gaza . "
Ms Hughes said the activists would not accede to an Israeli request unloading the ship ’s cargo at Ashdod port for transport to Gaza was not a deal the activists would strike with Israel , as the ship is carrying banned building materials including cement which would not be delivered .
“ It ’s bringing aid to Gaza that ’s not allowed such as medical equipment and construction materials .
If it docks in Ashdod , none of this aid will reach Gaza ” .
Speaking from the ship today , Dennis Halliday said : “ We want to emphasise that our aim is not provocation but getting our aid cargo into Gaza ” .
We are calling on the UN to inspect the cargo and escort us into Gaza , he said , adding “ we all remain in good spirits ” .
Irish officials have been maintaining close contact with the 1,200 - ton boat which was supposed to join the aid flotilla raided by Israeli commandos on Monday but was delayed due to mechanical problems .
“ We have continued to make it clear to the Israeli government . . . that we want maximum restraint and we do not want any interception in international waters , ” Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said .
“ It has been a terrible week in terms of the loss of life and there is now an obligation on all involved to reduce tension . . .
It is extremely important that we do not have a repeat of what happened earlier this week . ”
Israel ’s ambassador to Ireland , Zion Evrony , has said Israel does not expect any confrontation or violence when the MV Rachel Corrie approaches the exclusion zone .
The storming of the six - ship flotilla by Israeli commandos on Monday resulted in the deaths of nine activists and prompted renewed international criticism of Israel ’s blockade .

NEW ORLEANS --
A federal grand jury today indicted 3 current and 2 former New Orleans police officers in
, who was shot to death in the chaotic days after Hurricane Katrina , U.S. Attorney Jim Letten announced .
Glover was shot and his body was left in a car behind the Algiers levee , which was torched by the officers , according to the 11 - count indictment .
Former police officer David Warren , a rookie at the time , is charged with shooting and killing Glover .
He was arrested and is set to appear for a bond hearing today before a magistrate judge , where prosecutors are expected to ask that he be held without bond until trial , the Times - Picayune reports .
Of the massive ensemble that Lost employed over the last six years , I think Josh Holloway is in the best position to vault into stardom after the show ended its run last week .
His manly brand of Southern swagger is suited to fill a void in a Hollywood that often looks overseas for rugged masculinity ( see Jason Statham , Sam Worthington , Christian Bale , Russell Crowe ) .
It seems Marvel took notice : it is rumored that the studio talking with Holloway about starring in an upcoming film .
There ’s no word on which character he might play , but it is exciting news nonetheless .
Marvel Studios is really the place to be if you ’re looking to launch a film career ( though the pay might not be great ) .
Hit the jump for speculation on roles that might fit the Holloway profile , including Ant - Man , Hawkeye , and Dum Dum Dugan .
I know precious little about the greater Marvel universe ( merde ) , so these suggestions come from the source of the rumor , Avengers News .
Here are some quick character bios courtesy of Wikipedia .
ANT -MAN
Henry Pym is a biochemist initially married to a Hungarian woman , Maria Trovaya , who is later killed by the Hungarian Secret Police .
Shortly afterward , Pym discovers what he calls “ Pym particles , ” a rare group of subatomic particles from which he formulates a size - altering formula .
Testing the solution on himself , Pym discovers that one type of particles shrinks objects while the other restores an object to its natural size .
Pym shrinks himself to the size of an insect and has a dangerous encounter with ants from a nearby anthill .
After restoring himself and undertaking an exhaustive study of ants , Pym constructs a cybernetic helmet that allows him to communicate with and control ants .
Pym designs a costume and reinvents himself as the superhero Ant - Man .
I like the idea of Holloway - led Ant - Man film best , if only because Edgar Wright ( Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World ) has long been attached to the project .
HAWKEYE
Clint Barton was an orphan , and ran away from the orphanage as a pre-teen to join the circus as a carnival performer , where he was trained in the use of the bow and arrow by the Swordsman and Trickshot .
When he discovered that his mentors were both criminals he rejected them , leading to a beating by Swordsman which left Barton badly injured and hospitalized .
Years later , he saw Iron Man in action , and was inspired and decided to become a costumed hero called Hawkeye .
It was rumored awhile back that Jeremy Renner ( The Hurt Locker ) was in talks for Hawkeye , and I can see Holloway and Renner being recruited for the same roles : in my ideal world , the comic company could find vehicles for both .
DUM DUM DUGAN
Dugan was born in Boston , Massachusetts .
During World War II , while working as a circus strongman , Dugan helps Nick Fury and Sam “ Happy ” Sawyer escape the Nazis during a mission recounted in issue 34 .
Dugan later joins the British Army , and when Sawyer is charged with creating Fury ’s First Attack Squad , also known as the Howling Commandos , Sawyer invites Dugan to become second in command .
His exceptional strength saves the day in several of his adventures in the Sgt.
Fury comic books .
As far as Dugan goes , I think I ’d like a mustachioed Holloway .
It is worth wondering if Holloway can translate his screen presence into lasting star power .
He did play the same character on a beloved television show for six years ( 121 episodes ) , after all .
Will you be able to see him as anyone but Sawyer ?
If so , which Marvel character would you like to see him play ?
UK Solar Market to Increase 5x This Year and 30 x by 2015 ?
June 7th , 2010 by Zachary Shahan
[ social_buttons ]
Feed - in tariffs ( FiT ) have hit the UK and they are predicted to create a big boost for solar energy .
A new report by PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts a five - fold increase in demand for photovoltaic ( PV ) solar panels this year as a result .
1GW of Solar Energy in UK by 2015
The new report is titled
On the brink of a bright future ?
and predicts that the UK solar market can hit 1GW by 2015 .
At the end of 2009 , only 32MW of solar energy were installed in the UK ( 0.3 % of total renewable energy in the country ) , but with a new FiT scheme that could increase 30 times , the experts predict .
Changes in the Solar Industry
With a massive increase in demand , the professional quality of the solar industry is expected to improve in the UK as well .
“ The significant expansion that may be just around the corner will change today ’s ‘ cottage industry ’ into a much more professionally organised sector .
The PV market will become more sophisticated with more complex products and a greater focus on accountability for system performance , ” Daniel Guttmann , renewables director at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said .
Mr. Guttman warns that if the industry does n’t change quickly , however , the UK could miss out on the possibilities created here .
“ The industry will need to adapt and develop quickly to ensure that as much of the opportunity in terms of job and value creation is captured within the UK .
Companies that have been successful so far have benefited from investment in order to fund expansion .
Further investment will be required in order to train for and fund the rapid expansion expected . ”
Can the UK Catch Up to Germany ?
Increasing installed solar energy capacity 5 times this year and 30 times by 2015 is quite significant , but even with this forecast PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts that the UK wo n’t hit Germany ’s current solar capacity until 2020 .
Nonetheless , this will at least put them on the same playing field .

As an origami admirer with extremely limited skills ( and even more limited patience ) , I 'm always impressed by the artists who pull off works of art from paper .
In the case of Brian Chan , however , I 'm beyond impressed - I 'm absolutely floored .
The artist accomplishes beautiful creatures from across the animal kingdom , but takes his work one step further by folding likeness of some of the most celebrated characters from the four corners of fandom .
From comic books to anime and video games , Chan 's work on both his Web site and Flickr account demonstrates a talent worth celebrating .
After the jump , feast your eyes on a gallery of some of his raddest pop culture origami ( or origami period ) that you have ever seen .
55 storeys up , this infinity pool could glide you straight over the edge of Singapore , if not the world .
It 's part of the $ 6 billion Marina Bay Sands Skypark hotel , which just opened this week .

Ok , so if you were really to propel yourself over the edge , you 'd fall into a catchment - area which sends the excess water straight back into the pool .
But where 's the fun in that ?
The pool itself is three times the length of an Olympic - sized pool , and is the largest pool in the world at that height reportedly .
Another world record has been broken , with the hotel also becoming the most expensive hotel — knocking Abu Dhabi's Emirates Palace Hotel off it pedestal , which cost a measly $ 3 billion to build back in 2004 .

The pool runs across three of the hotel 's towers , which feature indoor canals , casinos , shops , theaters and a museum .
As well as the hotel rooms you 'd expect .
Do n't expect to be staying here on your next visit to Singapore though , as entrance to the casino alone costs $ 70 .
[ La Repubblica via DesignBoom ]
UPDATE : Apparently the casino charge is only to residents of Singapore , whose government wishes to deter them from gambling .
Foreigners can enter the casino for free — though to look off the observation deck , that 'll cost $ 20 .

It is not clear if the tar balls drifted from the spill or were carried on a ship
Tar balls have landed on a Texas beach , meaning oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill has hit all five US Gulf states .
Tests identified the small amount of tar found on the Bolivar Peninsula , north - east of Galveston , as coming from BP 's blown - out well off Louisiana .
But officials said it was unclear if it had drifted hundreds of kilometres from the leak site or had fallen from ships taking part in the clean - up operation .
Up to 60,000 barrels of oil a day have leaked into the Gulf since 22 April .
BP has said its oil - capture systems collected or burnt off 24,980 barrels of oil on Monday , according to the Reuters news agency .
Over the past week , efforts to clean up the spill have been hampered by the first hurricane of the Atlantic season , Hurricane Alex .
Separately , BP said it could cover the costs of the clean - up and compensation claims without selling new shares , amid rumours that a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund was about to buy a stake .
Relief wells
The commander of the US Coast Guard in the Galveston region , Capt Marcus Woodring , said about five gallons ( 19 litres ) of tar balls from the Deepwater Horizon leak had been found on Saturday .
But he said it was impossible to confirm whether they had drifted from the site of the leak , about 550 miles ( 885 km ) away , or had dropped off one of the ships carrying collected oil to Texas to be processed .
We 're cautiously optimistic this is an anomaly Joe Jaworski , Mayor of Galveston Inside an oil industry nightmare
The joint BP - US government response team said there were doubts that the oil had drifted all the way from the spill .
" The testing found that the oil was lightly weathered , raising doubts that the oil traversed the Gulf from the spill source , " a statement said .
Galveston 's mayor , Joe Jaworski , said he was hopeful the analysis was correct and that the tar balls were not a sign of more oil to come .
" This is good news .
The water looks good .
We 're cautiously optimistic this is an anomaly , " he said .
Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson meanwhile promised in a statement that any of the state 's coastline affected by the spill " will be cleaned up quickly and BP will be picking up the tab " .
The coasts of four other US Gulf states - Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida - have so far been more seriously affected by the spill .
Tar balls and oily water were spotted on Monday near the mouth of Lake Pontchartrain , a large lake to the north of New Orleans , in Louisiana .

The world 's largest skimmer is one recent arrival to the Gulf
Rough weather since Hurricane Alex passed through the Gulf , to the south of the spill , has hampered clean - up operations for the last week .
Tests of a giant tanker refitted to scoop up oil have been inconclusive because of high seas , the ship 's operators said .
The first of two relief wells being drilled to permanently cap the well is seven days ahead of schedule , but officials said on Tuesday that it was still likely to be mid-August before the operation could be completed .
In the meantime , some of the leaking oil is being piped to the surface from a cap over part of the well .
BP spokesman Mark Proegler has said the company hopes to connect " by the end of the week " a third tanker , Helix Producer , to its collection system to increase capacity to 53,000 barrels a day from the current limit of 28,000 .
The Helix Producer will form part of a new collection system involving a so - called floating riser and four vessels which will be able to disconnect and reconnect quickly , reducing the time lost when collection is halted because of rough seas .
The new system should be able to handle up to 80,000 barrels of oil a day .
The Deepwater Horizon rig - operated by Transocean on behalf of BP and its partners - exploded on 20 April and later sank with the loss of 11 lives , leading to the worst oil spill in US history .
US scientists estimate 35 - 60,000 barrels per day are leaking from the well , about one mile ( 1.6 km ) below the surface of the water .
PRESIDENT MARY McAleese and her officials were left red - faced last night after it was learned that remarks she made on Tuesday night in Turkey linking that country with Drogheda were based on local myth and not fact .
The comments were made during a state dinner in the capital , Ankara , as part of a four - day official visit .
Mrs McAleese told VIP guests Turkey had helped Ireland during the Famine .
She said : “ During that famine , Turkey ’s then leader Sultan Abdul Majid sent three ships loaded with food to Ireland .
The cargo was unloaded in a port called Drogheda and since then , at the insistence of the people , the star and crescent of your country forms part of the town ’s coat of arms . ”
Local historians in Drogheda have been left wondering where the President ’s scriptwriters unearthed the details .
Liam Reilly , an administrator with the Old Drogheda Society based in the town ’s Millmount Museum , said last night the comments were incorrect .
“ There are no records with the Drogheda Port Authority of this ever happening .
Drogheda historians can trace the star and crescent back to 1210 when the British governor of Ireland , King John Lackland , granted the town its first charter , ” he said .
Spokeswoman for Mrs McAleese Sheila Clarke said : “ While included in good faith on information supplied , it is now accepted that the reference . . . would not appear to be based on sound historical fact . ”
Simply put , this is an excellent biography of Nietzsche , and a model of what a philosophical biography should be .
Young offers a smooth integration of biographical detail and philosophical analysis so that one can readily see how Nietzsche 's life and thought informed one another .
He stakes out some controversial interpretive claims , but even setting these aside , Young has produced a study that must be read by every Nietzsche scholar and by anyone interested more generally in the shaping of the modern philosophical landscape .
Among other Nietzsche biographies available in English , Young 's biography improves hugely upon Safranski ( 2002 ) and Hollingdale ( 1965 ) , and sizably upon both Kaufmann ( 1950 ) and Hayman ( 1980 ) in scope and detail .
It is a difficult balance to achieve , but Young has a keen sense of exactly how much detail to relate without becoming tedious and tiresome .
He vividly describes the particulars of Nietzsche 's very real " living concerns " -- his fragile health , his financial limits , his changing relations with family and friends , and his constant quest to find the atmospheric conditions for his work -- without reducing Nietzsche 's thoughts to these concerns .
Young preserves this balance by alternating between sections of mainly biographical material and sections with more substantive philosophical analysis .
He usefully enlists a wide array of materials , from Nietzsche 's notebooks to the correspondence of his various acquaintances ( both with Nietzsche and with one another ) in order to illuminate Nietzsche 's life and thought .
And so we are provided with helpful accounts of the relevant historical and political circumstances , including the events of the Franco - Prussian war , Bismarck 's rise to power , and the growth of Bayreuth and the Wagner industry .
At the same time , we are given stimulating and informed philosophical discussions of Hölderlin , Schopenhauer , and ( once again ) Wagner .
All of these discussions combine to provide a rich sense of Nietzsche 's circumstances -- social , historical , and intellectual .
As an example of one of the revealing historical insights Young provides , consider his discussion of Nietzsche 's relation to the " Life - Reform Movement " ( Lebensreform Bewegung ) in Germany .
This movement was expressed in many forms , but its adherents generally seem to have promoted a new generation of " free spirits , " a return to nature , freedom from the entrapments of industrial civil society , new forms of spirituality , and formations of communes .
They were basically 19th - century hippies , as Young notes , and though it would certainly be a mistake to categorize Nietzsche as just another hippie , it is nevertheless instructive to view Nietzsche 's own discussions of free spirits , along with his many plans for forming philosophical communes and his dietary advice , against the backdrop of this larger social movement .
In so viewing him , he becomes less of a lone voice in the wilderness and more of a very distinctive voice in a chorus demanding cultural reform .
It is furthermore to Young 's great credit that he devotes ample insight and space to the importance of music to Nietzsche .
Cambridge UP has made Nietzsche 's own music available on the web , and Young frequently alludes to various pieces , explains their significance , and reviews how they were received by various parties .
It should be recognized that Nietzsche 's music has received an undeservedly bad rap -- some notable musicians , such as Lizst , quite liked it .
Young also sensibly and sensitively treats at length Nietzsche 's changing attitudes towards women , both toward the women he knew personally and toward the whole " species , " as Nietzsche might have put it .
Basically , it ends up looking like Nietzsche ranked as something of a 19th - century feminist until Lou Salome jilted him , and then he turned toward misogyny in varying strengths .
When it comes to the philosophical analysis of Nietzsche 's thought , Young 's book is also instructive , and his close detective work integrating letters and notebooks with Nietzsche 's published works leads to several intriguing and compelling observations .
So , for instance , Young sorts out passages that lend themselves toward a " postmodern " reading of Nietzsche ( which holds , basically , that since " reality " itself arises out of discourse , all interpretations of " it " are equal ) and carefully compares them to companion notebook entries and other discussions with an eye toward a realist view that Nietzsche also voiced , namely : that many different interpretations of a genuinely real world may be said to be equally valid , with respect to our needs or concerns at a given time ( a " pluralist " reading ) .
It is a hard interpretive call to make , given the mercurial nature of some of the texts , and Nietzsche may have slid back and forth between the two views , but in the end Young makes a compelling case for taking the pluralist reading as predominant .
" Reality , " as he suggests on Nietzsche 's behalf ,
is multi-aspected .
Some perspectives ( not all , of course ) genuinely reveal aspects of reality .
The more genuine perspectives one has command of , the more ' knowledgeable ' one is , the closer one comes to the -- unattainable but inspiring -- goal of ' completing science ' ( 475 -6 ) .
( The same could be said of the goal of ' completing an understanding of Nietzsche 's thought , ' come to think of it . )
But there are three distinctive interpretive claims
Young makes that are sure to invite challenges from the specialists .
( The first two claims will be familiar to those who have already read Young 's Nietzsche 's Philosophy of Religion . )
The first is that an overarching aim of Nietzsche 's philosophy is to provide " a new religious outlook to re-found culture " ( 181 , my emphasis ) .
This may seem a wholly implausible claim to make on behalf of the man who wrote " God is dead " and was the author of the Antichrist .
But what is meant by " religious " ?
If we suppose that what Young means is not much more than having a certain reverential attitude toward , well , something , then the claim is quite plausible .
For Nietzsche certainly had that : he revered many things , including life , nobility , health , hardness , strength , and cultural achievement .
And there certainly is a religious fervor permeating Zarathustra as well as Nietzsche 's other passionate texts .
So , to the extent that Young means only to say that Nietzsche had a kinda religiousy outlook upon what he understood as virtues , he is surely right .
But in fact Young often means more than just this .
He thinks Nietzsche maintains that the " higher men " will need to raise up divine beings , at least as heuristics to guide their efforts and orient their post - Christian society , and he comes awfully close to claiming that Nietzsche proposes a return to Greek polytheism ( 518 ) .
That is a bit much .
Surely , one thinks , we can draw some distinction between the sort of " life - attitude " Nietzsche advocates and a temperament that is more properly understood as religious -- a distinction arising perhaps from the icy intellect Nietzsche thinks one must have in order to see things properly .
It is hard to imagine returning to our idols , even as heuristics , once we have seen through them .
The second controversial interpretive claim is that Nietzsche , far from trying to demolish traditional morality , was out to " re- found " the sorts of values we might today identify with communitarianism .
Young returns to this claim frequently throughout his book , and it must be said that he gathers up surprisingly good evidence for it .
Nietzsche did see himself as a " good European , " and consistently despised the growing German Reich , so it is no stretch to see his overall concerns as cosmopolitan .
But in the end , on Young 's reading , when we find out that Nietzsche wants a society infused with compassion and high culture , and that he might look favorably upon one that finds its unity in a shared effort to combat global warming (! - 479 ) , one is left wondering whether Nietzsche has been tamed into something more familiar and friendly to our own moral sensibilities .
Indeed , why would Nietzsche prophesy that someday his name would be associated with " something frightful -- of a crisis like no other on earth , of the profoundest collision of conscience , of a decision evoked against everything that until then had been believed in , demanded , sanctified " -- if in the end all he wanted to establish was that we as a community need to care more about one another and about higher culture ?
Young writes , thinking of Zarathustra , " For the ideal leader , indeed for any truly healthy person , the prosperity of the community ( of humanity ) as a whole is the defining meaning of their lives .
For the healthy person , personal meaning is communal meaning " ( 516 ) .
But this would mean that very little of Young 's Nietzsche would present much of a challenge to any contemporary liberal , which should alert us to the possibility that something important has gone missing .
When Nietzsche urged that we move beyond good and evil , did he really just mean trading in the Ten Commandments for the Green Party ?
The third controversial claim is that , by the end of his life , Nietzsche had repudiated the " will to power " doctrine , or at least had backed off it so that it was only a claim about the value of health to bring happiness to a human life .
This brings us to a fine example of Young 's sleuthing through texts .
The short version of Young 's careful account ( over 536 - 549 ) is that Nietzsche started working on a sizable , definitive work entitled The Will to Power in 1885 .
It was to be his theory of everything .
And so we find , in notes and publications continuing through 1888 , many attempts to advance the will to power as a metaphysical doctrine .
But in letters to his friends Nietzsche began to confess that the project was not coming together as he had hoped , and indeed " had gone down the plug hole [ ins Wasser gefallen ] . "
Some of his materials were repackaged into what became Twilight of the Idols , and other materials were designated for a new multi-volume work , the Revaluation of All Values .
According to Young 's account , the change in strategy resulted principally from Nietzsche ( a ) recognizing that the will to power doctrine , in its most sweeping , metaphysical guise , was simply implausible , as well as ( b ) coming to conclude that the overly systematic nature of the enterprise was in conflict with his own philosophical temperament .
Vestiges of the will to power doctrine remain in Nietzsche 's mature account of what constitutes a healthy psychology , Young maintains , but the big systematic metaphysics finally disappears from his horizon .
I find Young 's arguments for this claim compelling ( though I do not fully agree with his account of Nietzschean health ) .
A reviewer for the New York Times complained that Young 's book is marred by frequent references to pop culture and recent politics .
Indeed one will find scattered mention of the Iraq war , iPhones , and Second Life avatars .
This is mainly only a matter of taste ( dry classicism vs. juicy immanence ) , but one serious danger with being " too timely " is that one might misread one 's own times , or become swept up in them .
Thus the reader is surprised to come across someone who has reduced his carbon footprint by knitting sweaters and relying on windmills used as an example of a latter - day Nietzschean argonaut ; he is equally surprised by the speculation that Nietzsche would have been buoyed by U.S. President Barack Obama 's potential for providing " spiritual leadership with global power " ( 333n ) .
There also are a couple of simply bizarre tangential observations , such as that Robert Mugabe 's violence perpetrated on his own people is somehow related to his own good health , and that the " stench " of the Nazis is still present in the Nietzsche Archive house in Weimar .
These invite some head scratching , to be sure .
But enough carping over minor infelicities .
I stand by my earlier claim that this is the very model of a philosophical biography .
Indeed , Young 's work will be the principal biographical reference for this and the next generation of Nietzsche scholars .
After that , of course , we scholars will need to tell the story all over again to ourselves .
Eternal return of the same , you know ? [ 1 ]
A recent jury verdict in a major sex discrimination lawsuit against the drug maker Novartis serves as a reminder that the nation still has a way to go in eradicating the unfair treatment of women in employment .
The federal class - action lawsuit involved claims that Novartis discriminated against female sales employees in pay and promotions  especially women who became pregnant and took maternity leave .
After a five - week trial , the jury of five women and four men ruled against the company and required it to pay $ 3.36 million in compensatory damages to 12 of the women who testified .
Individual awards ranged from $ 50,000 to nearly $ 600,000 .
Nearly 5,600 other female employees will be eligible to apply to a court - appointed special master for similar individual damages , which , in total , could exceed $ 200 million when the reckoning is over .
In addition , the jury held Novartis liable for $ 250 million in punitive damages for its discriminatory conduct .
The judge is expected to rule shortly on awards of back pay .
Beyond the negative reflection on one company ’s practices , and the deterrent to bad behavior by others , the case contains a timely message for Congress .
WASHINGTON ( PAI ) –
Is single - payer government - run health care – a key cause for 21 international unions and 500 other labor organizations and a bugaboo for the health insurers and the Radical Right – in the massive health care overhaul Congress approved on party - line votes and President Barack Obama signed ?
Its top senatorial proponent , Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders , says the answer is “ yes , ” even though the words “ single payer ” are n’t written down .
And there are some conditions that must be met before single - payer systems are up and running .
Interviews with Sanders , his staff and some experts in the health care field disclose the law has a provision allowing states , under certain conditions , to establish their own alternative state - run health care systems , starting in 2017 .
States would have to get federal waivers to establish their own systems .
But within broad guidelines , states could set up whatever they want , including single - payer .
The state alternative systems must meet certain conditions , Sanders ’ top health care legislative staffers say .
One condition – that all states must in 2014 establish health care “ exchanges ” to cover those who otherwise are not covered – may make it harder to switch to single - payer , the staffers admit .
After all , they point out , the states would in essence have to establish one system that year , and then tear it down and replace it with another , and that ’s heavy lifting for state legislators , the Sanders staffers admit .
Sanders is trying to build a coalition to change the date for the alternative systems to 2014 , too .
The key requirement states must meet , the staffers say , is that any alternative health care system , including single - payer , “ must do as much or more ” for health care users “ as the existing program does , ” referring to the exchanges .
“ The idea is that if a state puts together a health care plan – and it could be any type of a plan , including single - payer – as long as they could demonstrate that it would cover as many people , that the coverage would be at least as good , and that it would be at least as affordable , they ’d get the waiver from operating the exchange , ” Sanders ’ top legislative aide told Press Associates Union News Service .
“ Then all the tax subsidies ” for health care in the overhaul bill “ would go to single - payer instead – as long as individuals would n’t have to pay more , ” he added .
The prospect of being allowed to experiment pushed several states into probing single - payer and other alternatives on their own , before the 2017 date , says Rachel Rosen DeGolia , executive director of Cleveland - based Universal Health Care Action Now , a longtime advocate of single - payer – including single - payer state by state .
Those states include California , Pennsylvania , Vermont and Connecticut :
In California , the California Nurses Association / National Nurses Organizing Committee – now a large part of 155,000 - member National Nurses United – pushed two statewide single - payer bills through the Democratic - run legislature since the start of the decade .
Both were vetoed by GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Vermont extended its state - run health care system to cover 95 % of state residents during the administration of former Democratic Gov. Howard Dean , a physician .
Its legislature just approved a measure to study both single - payer and the “ public option . ”
The public option , which would have put the federal government in competition with the health insurers for covering the uninsured , was dropped from the health care overhaul at the insistence of a “ swing ” lawmaker , Sen. Joseph Lieberman , Ind.- Conn .
Otherwise , he would have voted “ no , ” killing the bill .
Ironically , Lieberman ’s Connecticut – which houses headquarters of several large insurers – is considering alternatives , too .
Faced with threatened huge health insurance rate hikes last year , the Democratic - run legislature passed and GOP Gov. M. Jodi Rell signed a measure to extend the public option there , DeGolia says .
In Pennsylvania , a bipartisan coalition of 34 state senators signed onto a bill to explore single - payer , and is putting pressure on the state senate ’s health committee chairman to hold hearings .
That lawmaker is from Pittsburgh , headquarters of the Steelworkers .
USW , led by Canadian native Leo Gerard , whose nation got single - payer province by province , is one of the most - outspoken backers of single - payer .
Meanwhile , Ellen Shaffer , a former congressional staffer specializing in health care who now co-heads the Center for Policy Analysis , warns progressives not to sit on their hands this fall , lest the GOP win back Congress – and undo prior progress .
“ While we share the long - term goal of a universal ‘ Medicare for all ’ system , too many on the left are ignoring the important improvements to access and quality of care that the new law will achieve – and the policy space that it creates to go further in the future , ” she writes in a recent blog .
“ Women in particular have important reasons to stay active , including the need to defend new laws that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against them , ” Shaffer adds .

Snapper 's serves authentic Gulf seafood .
Its shrimp po ' boy is famous — " dees shrimp are n't shrimps " — and it's worth the $ 9.95 .
This year is different .
There 's an oil spill out of control in the Gulf of Mexico .
I 'm the only customer in the restaurant .
I ordered the Seafood Platter — fried fish , shrimp , oysters and stuffed crab .
The waiter asked , " Would you like that with tartar sauce , cocktail sauce or BP oil ? "
He 's said this joke so many times lately , he does n't even wait for a laugh .
" It will get better , " he said .
" It better get better or else . "
They 've had to raise the price of a shrimp po ' boy to $ 10.95 .
There 's a ban on fishing in the Mississippi Sound off the Biloxi coastline .
It takes more time and money to go farther out to catch fish , and there are fewer fish to catch , so prices are up all down the line .
Fear of the BP oil spill has caught Biloxi in a stranglehold .
It 's choking the biggest parts of Biloxi 's economy — tourism , seafood and casinos .
Biloxi is the gambling capital of the Redneck Riviera .
It has the longest man -made beach in the world .
The sand is snowy white .
Biloxi is home to the best - tasting fried oyster sandwiches .
Biloxi swears you wo n't find any better recreational fishing anywhere .
There 's a lot of fun in Biloxi .
Now hope is on hold while the BP oil spill shakes the local economy .
Casino action is down , the beach is empty , restaurants are laying off waiters and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality says it 's not safe to fish off the coastline .
It 's anybody 's guess how long Biloxi will reel from the oil spill .
Sure , hurricanes — like Camille in 1969 and Katrina in 2005 — shook Biloxi .
But strong people rebuild from a storm .
BP 's oil spill may put Biloxi on the ropes for nobody knows how long .
Every morning federal and state safety officials inspect fresh fish , shrimp and oysters coming to market from nighttime fishing trips .
The seafood is safe to eat .
My seafood platter was terrific .
Yet people , tourists and natives alike , are reluctant to buy it .
Burgers and penny slots
Burger business is booming in this beach town that calls itself the " Seafood Capital of the World . "
With that unrelenting deep - water gusher , even gambling is risky business .
Upscale hotels are still doing well .
I could n't get a room at the Beau Rivage or Hard Rock , but I pretty much had the run of the Treasure Bay Casino and Hotel .
I played penny slot machines surrounded by women and seniors smoking cigarettes , drinking and eating , all at the same time .
I did n't know they still made penny slots .
One bright afternoon , I walked along the sand from the Treasure Bay to the Beau Rivage .
I 'd like to think it was a few miles , but it 's probably shorter .
I did n't pass one person swimming , playing Frisbee , soaking up the sun or looking for buried treasure with a metal detector .
The beach was dead empty .
No people .
No tar balls or oil , either .
If you did n't know that a monster oil spill was looming offshore , you never would have guessed it .
The only thing that looks weird was no people .
That 's what is so frustrating to Biloxi business owners .
Biloxi does n't sit directly on the Gulf of Mexico .
It is protected by the Mississippi Sound .
There are outer islands and reefs that kept the BP oil spill at a distance , so far , for the most part .
The TV news talks about families changing their Gulf vacation plans from Biloxi and heading to the other side of Florida or Disney World .
There is a swimming advisory , but nobody will stop you if you want to swim or boogie board in the surf .
Deckhand vents in song
The Sailfish " Live Marine Adventure Cruise " holds 50 people , and most summers you had to board early to get a seat .
The day I went — five people .
Before we left dock , a deckhand unpacked his guitar and performed an angry song about the oil spill .
He 's not angry at BP , though .
He 's had it with TV news and newspapers .
He thinks the media are scaring people to death and ruining Biloxi business when there 's no need for alarm .
Not yet .
Something 's happening in the Gulf of Mexico ,
There 's a big oil spill , hell , where will it go ?
The media is chasing it like a big show
But the Lord in Heaven 's the only one who knows .
Well it ai n't nothing but a big con job ,
Everybody 's hoping for a big oil blob .
One said there was oil in Mississippi
Another said the governor wo n't get on his knees ,
I ain't saying that it 's a good thing .
Just tell the truth like the song that I sing .
The deckhand works for tips .
Fewer tourists , less money for him .
He said business is down around 70 percent aboard the Sailfish this summer .
He pulls in the shrimp net and explains the difference between Gulf shrimp and farm - raised shrimp from Asia - the shrimp you might find in your next po ' boy if BP does n't plug this leak soon .
" When you eat a shrimp , you 're not only tasting the shrimp , you 're tasting the water it lived in .
The Gulf of Mexico is like a gumbo with all sorts of fish , plant life and algae .
It 's the best place for shrimp .
It takes 18 months for a Gulf shrimp to grow to jumbo size and they absorb all that flavor .
" In Asia , on their shrimp farms , they have different water and it takes a shrimp only eight months to become jumbo size .
I challenge anybody to sample both shrimp and say that farm - raised shrimp tastes anywhere near as good as Gulf shrimp , " he said .
" That could be gone .
But it 's not gone yet . "

Posted by John , July 12th , 2010 - under Julia Gillard , Reaction .
Tags : Feminism
Julia Gillard ’s ascension to the Prime Ministership has exposed the fault lines of Australian feminism between the liberals and the liberationists .
Already some feminists are complaining that the attacks on Gillard are because she is a woman , not because she is a reactionary .
Some committed women unionists have swung totally behind Gillard despite the fact her policies are the antithesis of all they stand for on workers ’ rights , equal pay , equal love , the Northern Territory intervention , climate change , refugees , Palestine …
The list goes on .
For many feminists ( but not all ) it is gender that is all important , not class .
For the revolutionary left the basic issue is class , an analysis which helps explain why women are oppressed in our society .
But it also explains Gillard ’s reactionary policies .
Gillard rules for that small minority – men and , increasingly , women – who live off our labour .
They make the big decisions in society , for example about living standards and jobs and about what to produce and how much , all in the name of profit rather than satisfying human need .
In this Gillard carries on the tradition of such wonderful female ruling class politicians as Margaret Thatcher , Indira Gandhi and Golda Meir .
From the revolutionary left ’s position , the scrutiny of Gillard has been as intense as that of Rudd .
Both are the lapdogs of capital .
Gillard has been the harbinger , if this was at all possible , of Labor ’s further move to the right .
The capitulation to the big 3 mining companies , the attack on refugees , the continuation of the war in Afghanistan and of the intervention in the Northern Territory , the blind support for Israel ’s ongoing genocide of the Palestinians , the widening of the gap between men’s and women ’s wages , are all examples not of Gillard as a caring sharing woman but of her as the brutal overseer of a system that dehumanises women and men .
Her policies hurt women – women as workers , women as refugees , women as Palestinians , women as aborigines .
We on the Left criticise Gillard not because she is a woman but because she attacks women in order to serve the interests of her class .
She is part of the problem , not the solution .

I recently started listening to the E-mything Your Business Podcast which is essentially a nine - episode commercial for a book called Built to Sell : Turn Your Business Into One You Can Sell .
But it ’s not a bad commercial ; it has interesting information about the factors that can substantially increase the value of a business .
This ties in with something I ’ve said before :
Build your business to sell , even if you have no plans to .
This is because the factors that make a business attractive to potential acquirers are the same ones that make your business a better business to own : efficiency , automation , repeatable , documented , scalable , etc …
Notice I ’m not talking about building your business “ to flip . ”
Flipping implies building a shoddy company that maximizes short - term profit .
Instead , we ’re talking about building your startup to maximize its value based on factors the market values , since these factors will make it a better company to own in the both the short - and long - term .
A Product that Scales
The author , John Warrillow , says that most businesses do not scale well .
By “ scale ” he means : can the business grow very quickly without a lot of manual intervention ?
A consulting firm scales very poorly .
You ’ve likely tried consulting work or are still doing it , and you know it ’s a dollars - for - hours trade .
Nothing scalable ( or fun ) about that .
This is why you ’re thinking about a startup , right ?
The three components to a scalable business , according to John , are being :
Repeatable Teachable Valuable
Let ’s take a look at each one of these in the context of a startup .
Repeatable
In a traditional business a repeatable product / service is something that does not require a high level of expertise and customization every time you make a sale .
The sales process might be customized , but the product or service should be as cookie - cutter as you can make it .
The more repeatable , the more profit you will make with each sale , and the more valuable your company becomes .
In a startup , this means developing a product and a sales process that does not require your time .
Ideally you want the entire sales process to take place on your website with no manual intervention , including the purchase , order fulfillment , serial number generation , etc …
The ability to leave your startup on auto - pilot for a few weeks while you ’re out of town ( or working hard on new features ) means more profit per hour for you , and a higher valuation should you ever decide to sell .
The lesson : build a product that does not require customizations , and completely automate your order fulfillment process .
Teachable
In a traditional business you leverage the time of your employees .
You pay them less than you bill out , and you keep the difference .
This means that the easier your process is to teach , the easier it is to find employees who can do the work , the more employees you can hire , and the more profit you will make per sale .
In a startup you have a few avenues : hire employees or use virtual assistants ( VAs ) .
In either case it ’s the same : having a process in place to handle customer support , refunds , product fulfillment , documentation updates , forum support , website updates , etc. will result in an easier ramp - up period for new hires , and less of your time that ’s wasted in training .
The lesson : create a written for everything in your business , even if you ’re the only person doing the work .
Valuable
John talks about having a product that ’s valuable to your customers .
In a traditional business this means offering non-commodity products and services .
For a startup , this means avoiding “ me too ” products , staying away from horizontal niches , solving a pain - point , and targeting a vertical niche .
By catering to a specific audience ( plumbers , grocery store owners , psychologists , etc… ) and building a product ( and marketing ) that caters to their every need … you will build something far more valuable than if you built the same product for a massive , horizontal audience .
The lesson : stick to vertical niches .
Occupations and hobbies are best .
Charge Up Front
The other point I ’ve taken away from the podcast is the fact that businesses that are the most valuable are able to charge for their work up - front .
So instead of selling a product or service and invoicing in 30 or 60 days , the most valuable businesses charge before the product or service is supplier .
This allows for better cash - flow , potential profitability from day 1 , and no need to take out a line of credit .
Applying this to startups is a no- brainer ; most of us will charge the customer ’s credit card before we provide a product .
The real application ( and perhaps the punchline ) is to charge for your product .
There are arguments against charging for your product , but unless you have venture funding they do not apply to you .

A British researcher , Richard Lynn , claims to have found a correlation between intelligence and relgious scepticism .
In a study spanning 137 countries , Lynn found that high intelligence produced an extremely high likelihood of the rejection of religious faith .
Lynn is an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Ulster and wrote the study with John Harvey and Helmuth Nyborg , of the University of Aarhus , Denmark .
In one study cited by the men , a survey of the American National Academy of Sciences found only 7 percent believed in God .
Another survey of the Royal Society found that only 3.3 per cent believed in God while at the same time 68.5 per cent of the general UK population were believers .

Researchers Discover Relative of Best - Known Human Ancestor
Famed hominid " Lucy " no longer alone
Woranso - Mille Project in Ethiopia reveals only the second partial skeleton of A. afarensis .
June 21 , 2010
View video interviews with Yohannes Haile - Selassie of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and Tim White of University of California , Berkeley .
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
Within the coarsening base of an ancient mudstone exposure in the Afar Region of Ethiopia , researchers say they found evidence that provides new information about the best - known early human ancestor , Australopithecus afarensis .
Yohannes Haile - Selassie -- curator and head of physical anthropology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History -- and an international team of scientists dug up a 3.6 million - year - old partial skeleton of the same species as the famed hominid " Lucy . "
It 's only the second partial skeleton of A. afarensis to be recovered ; it 's 400,000 years older than Lucy and it 's male .
But just as important , the fossil remains provide conclusive proof that A. afarensis could walk upright freely without the use of its hands .
" The KSD skeleton is long sought fossil evidence , " said Haile - Selassie .
[ KSD is shorthand for ' Korsi Dora , ' the name of the locality where the skeleton was found . ]
" It complements the Laetoli footprints and incontrovertibly shows A. afarensis was an obligate bipedal since its first appearance in the fossil record . "
The new skeleton 's scientific designation is KSD - VP - 1/1 .
Researchers recovered the skeleton as part of the paleontology - focused Woranso - Mille Project that has been ongoing in the region since 2004 .
The researchers report the finding in this week 's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences early online publication .
The National Science Foundation is a major funder of the work .
Previous examinations of Lucy , who lived 3.2 million years ago , led some scientists to conclude A. afarensis was not fully adapted to upright walking .
The newly recovered fossil , nicknamed " Kadanuumuu " and pronounced " kah - DAH - noo - moo , " clears up the debate .
" Kadanuumuu " appears to be in good agreement with fossilized footprints dated to about 3.6 million years ago and discovered in Laetoli , a site in Tanzania in eastern Africa .
The footprints show that early human ancestors habitually walked upright ; there are no knuckle - impressions or signs of abducted toes .
The misinterpretation concerning Lucy 's ability to walk upright resulted largely from her small frame , said Haile - Selassie referring to her estimated 3 1 ⁄2 feet .
But " Kadanuumuu , " whose name means " big man " in the Afar language , is 5 to 5 1 / 2 feet tall and the proportion of the length of his legs to his arms compares favorably to modern humans .
Long legs are a tell - tale human characteristic of bipedalism .
" Generally speaking , the skeleton clearly shows that the emergence of advanced bipedality is not associated with the first appearance of our genus Homo , " said Haile - Selassie .
" But rather it has deep roots going back to more than 3.6 million years ago . "
" Kadanuumuu " also has most of the same skeletal parts as Lucy and others never previously known , including a significant portion of the rib cage and a nearly complete adult shoulder blade .
" ' Kadanuumuu's ' shoulder was also a major discovery , " said Haile - Selassie .
" It shows that our ancestor 's shoulder blade and rib cage were much more similar to those of modern humans than previously had been thought . "
Before now anthropologists concluded evolutionary ancestors had shoulders more like those of chimpanzees .
But " Kadanuumuu " surprised researchers by revealing a shoulder very different from chimpanzees , which are thought to be the closest living relatives of Homo sapiens .
" This tells us that chimpanzees have evolved a great deal since we shared a last common ancestor with them , " said Haile - Selassie .
Renowned Ethiopian fossil hunter Alemayehu Asfaw found the first element of " Kadanuumuu " in February 2005 at Korsi Dora , about 210 air miles northeast of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa .
The specimen was exposed on the surface and further investigation resulted in the recovery of more elements .
Excavations between 2005 and 2008 uncovered an upper arm , a collarbone , neck bones , ribs , pelvis , sacrum , a thighbone , a shinbone and the shoulder blade .
Excavations took more than five years to complete .
Publication of more results will continue as researchers complete more detailed analysis of Kadanuumuu .
Scientists from Case Western Reserve University , Ohio ; Berkeley Geochronology Center , Calif . ; Addis Ababa University , Ethiopia ; and Kent State University , Ohio contributed to this research .

GUILD WARS : GHOSTS OF ASCALON
Over the years , Dougal Keane developed a personal rule : Never adventure with people you like .
If pressed , he might modify it to : Do n’t adventure with people you ’d hate to see die .
Now , in the depths of the crypts beneath Divinity ’s Reach , he was getting his wish .
Dougal disliked his comrades intensely .
He also hated his task .
Most of all , at the moment , he hated the stifling heat of the crypts themselves .
The sweltering summer heat that enveloped Divinity ’s Reach above had stolen deep into the bowels of these hidden burial grounds , where it festered like a hidden wound .
The prevailing winds that caressed the burial ground ’s cliffside entrances might carry the stench of the warm , dry rot away from the city , but inside the crypt ’s twisting passages , Dougal had no means of escaping it .
People had been bringing their dead here since before the founding of Kryta ’s new capital , and Dougal swore he could smell the dust of every last one of them .
Their explorations had taken them into parts of the crypts that even Dougal was unaware existed .
At each branching of the path , Clagg had consulted his glowing map , then indicated they take the less - traveled option .
The smooth , polished flagstones of the Skull Gate in Divinity ’s Reach gave way to less - used paths , and finally to rooms and corridors that had been untouched since the dead were left here to desiccate centuries before the founding of the city above .
Still , as he stalked forward , brittle skull fragments of all shapes and sizes crunching beneath his feet , Dougal reminded himself that these crypts were n’t as bad as some places he had been .
The ruined temples of the Caledon Forest , or the Bloodtide Coast , its beaches awash with twitching , malevolent corpses .
Or Ascalon .
Never as bad as Ascalon .
Dougal stopped and rubbed the stubble on his chin as he scanned the bone - covered passage before him .
It opened into a wide chamber that stretched far beyond the reach of his torch ’s light .
It was clear of bones .
He did n’t like that .
He signaled for a stop , and his companions — the sylvari , the norn , and the asura riding his golem , the one who ’d hired the rest of them for this expedition — pulled up short behind him .
“ What is it ? ” snarled Clagg .
The asura was irritable when they first met , and the closed , stuffy air of the tomb had done nothing to improve his disposition .
Clagg ’s people had bubbled up from the depths of the world over two centuries ago , harbingers of the fact that the nature of Tyria was about to change .
They were a small people with oversized , flat - faced , ellipsoid heads , the width of which were made more pronounced by long ears , drooping in Clagg ’s case .
Their skin came in varying shades of gray , their large eyes a product of lives spent in magic - lit caves .
The asura arrived on the surface world not so much as refugees as settlers confident in their intellectual and magical superiority over every race they encountered .
And , Dougal had to admit to himself , they were often right in that assumption .
Clagg was seated comfortably in a harness fixed to the front of his golem , the creature a masterpiece of polished and painted stone and fitted bands of bronze .
Its articulated limbs hinged on glowing blue magical jewels that held the independent parts of the angular , headless creature together without actually touching them .
Magical force , magic beyond that which Dougal was comfortable with , held the creature together .
A single large crystal housed between its carved shoulders served as both its eyes and ears .
The sharp - faceted gem constantly swiveled around in its socket , scouring its environment for more input .
Clagg called it Breaker , and seemed more concerned about its well - being than that of the other members of the party .
“ I said , ‘ What is it ? ’ ” snarled the asura , its shark - like teeth flashing with irritation .
Dougal rarely saw an asura smile , and was never reassured when he did .
“ Something ’s wrong , ” Dougal said , keeping his voice low .
“ Humans , ” Gyda Oddsdottir muttered , shaking her head .
The silver sleigh bells woven into her long , yellow warrior ’s braid jangling loudly .
“ Always taking stock instead of taking action . ”
She set her huge hammer before her with a resounding thud , crushing a dry skull to dust .
Dougal winced , not at the norn ’s words , but at the racket she made .
At nine feet tall and bristling with weapons , she thundered down the halls , making more noise than the asura ’s golem .
This daughter of the distant snowcapped Shiverpeaks did n’t care who heard her coming : she wanted to warn them of her approach .
In the heat of the depths of the crypt , her heavily tattooed flesh dripped with a sheen of sweat .
Gyda ’s grandsires were refugees as well , fleeing from the power of one of the great Elder Dragons to the north .
The norn were a healthy , hearty , proud people , quick to anger and equally quick to forgive .
In his time since leaving Ebonhawke , Dougal had met good norn and bad norn .
The good ones treated every day as an adventure , every problem as a challenge , and every foe as a chance for personal glory .
Most people did n’t understand how dangerous the dark places of the world could be ; the norn actually relished exploring them .
Gyda , though , was definitely in the latter category of norn : boastful , judgmental , and unpleasant to those around her .
She was both bullying and insulting , as if any achievement by others diminished her own .
Dougal did n’t like it when she smiled , either .
“ The floor .
It ’s too clear , ” said Dougal , talking to Clagg but meaning it for Gyda .
“ No bones .
No one was buried here . ”
“ And that means a trap , ” said Killeen , the last member of the party , the sylvari , in her soft , melodious voice .
Dougal nodded .
The sylvari necromancer was probably the most pleasant individual of their motley krewe , himself included .
Shorter than a human but not as diminutive as the asura , her skin was a verdant green , her hair more similar to the leaves of a succulent plant than that of a human woman .
When she moved , golden pollen drifted off her .
The humanoid appearance , Dougal knew , was a lie .
Killeen and the others of her race were born fully formed from the fruit of a great white - barked tree far to the south .
There was no animal warmth to her flesh .
The sylvari were a recent addition to the world , their entire race only a little older than Dougal himself , but they had already spread far and wide , like an invading weed .
Killeen had all the traits attributed to her race : she was honest , direct , and focused .
In many ways she was better than most humans he knew .
That may have been what made Dougal most uncomfortable of all .
Killeen took Dougal ’s statement at face value , but Gyda instead snorted , “ I think you are just trying to delay us from our goal .
” The sylvari ignored Gyda but said , “ What do you think would set it off ?
” Dougal looked at the norn .
“ Not noise .
Maybe vibration , or maybe weight .
” “ The human ’s probably right , ” Clagg said , sitting in the relative safety of his armored harness .
“ I guess even a blind dredge finds a diamond some days . ”
The asura fiddled with a row of crystals set into his harness ’s front rim , then nodded to himself .
“ Ah , yes .
There it is .
Crude , but effective .
” “ What is it ? ” Dougal hated asking the question .
He knew the asura was fishing for yet another reason to explain how brilliant he was .
To an asura , the other races of the world existed primarily for heavy lifting , taking risks , and asking stupid questions .
“ If one of us were foolish enough to walk into that room , ” Clagg said , enunciating every syllable , “ it would trigger a lethal blast that could kill those present .
” Gyda harrumphed as if no explosives could slow her down , magical or otherwise .
Still , Dougal noticed , the norn ’s feet stayed rooted where they were .
“ If it is a trap , ca n’t Dougal disable it ? ” Killeen asked .
“ Is n’t that what you hired him for ? ” From any of the others , such a statement would have come laden with sarcasm and bile .
The sylvari , though , meant every word in earnest .
It was , indeed , why he was part of this expedition : his knowledge .
Of traps .
Of history .
Of the way the world used to be .
“ He hired me for my experience in recovering powerful artifacts , ” said Dougal .
Gyda let out a deep chuckle .
“ Robbing tombs , you mean .
” Dougal ignored her .
“ Does anyone have something helpful to add ? ” Dougal asked .
“ The petal - head ’s comment stands , ” said Clagg , prim as a schoolmaster , “ Thatwhy we brought you along , human .
We know the trap is there .
Now take care of it .
” Dougal reached down and picked up a skull , trying not to think about if this was an ancestor .
He aimed for a spot about in the middle of the room and touched the locket beneath his shirt for luck .
Then he pitched the skull underhand into the room .
Nothing .
He pitched another skull to a different area .
Nothing again .
He pitched a third .
Gyda rolled her eyes at his uselessness and folded her thick arms with impatience .
Clagg shook his head at him as if Dougal were an addled child .
“ Not set off by noise , ” said Dougal .
“ Not vibration or motion , either .
That leaves weight .
We should send in something heavy . ”
He looked at Gyda .
“ I will not be an experiment for you , ” said the norn quietly , her face clouded .
“ Well , then , the golem , ” said Dougal .
“ Strike that suggestion , ” snapped Clagg , “ I did not craft Breaker from scratch just to see it blown to smithereens .
This is your problem , human .
” “ You care more for that walking statue than you do for the rest of us , ” said Gyda .
“ Untrue , ” said the asura .
“ I just have less invested in you than in it . ” Killeen brightened , her eyes glowing a faint green .
“ Perhaps I can help .
” The sylvari set her chin and concentrated on a patch of the bones lining the left side of the passage .
She swung her arms and fingers in a complex pattern and spoke words that made Dougal ’s head ache slightly .
A greenish glow formed in the wall of bones and coalesced around a human - sized set of remains .
As Dougal watched , the bones detached from the surrounding patch and assembled themselves into a coherent skeleton .
The deep - green glow , rather than sinew and tendons , held it together .
The right side of its skull had been bashed in , and its jaw was missing , as was the lower part of its right arm , which terminated in a pair of jagged breaks .
It stood before them like a servant presenting itself to its betters .
Dougal shuddered as Killeen gave the creature a satisfied smile .
She gestured again , and the skeleton tottered around and stumbled off down the passage toward the room beyond .
Dougal glanced up at the bone - covered ceiling and reminded himself there had to be some stone and earth up there somewhere behind the remains — that they were n’t just moving through a tunnel carved out of a mountain of bones .
“ Hold on , ” he said , reaching toward Killeen as she smiled at the way her creation shambled away .
“ We should back up and take — ” The explosion cut him off .
The animated skeleton disappeared in a cloud of flame and smoke .
Dougal ducked down and wrapped his arms over his head as a cascade of bone fragments rained down on him , bouncing and clattering on the floor .
One flying shard of their animated helper shot into Dougal ’s heavy leather shirt and stuck there like a revenant ’s fang .
Dougal stood up and saw Clagg gazing into the cavern , pursing his lips .
“ Crude , ” the asura said .
“ But effective . ” Gyda shouldered past Dougal and laughed .
As she strode into the chamber beyond , she grinned at the scorch mark where the skeleton once stood .
“ Well done , sapling , ” she said to Killeen .
“ At leastare earning your pay .
” Dougal winced at the implicit insult .
To the group at large he said , “ We need to press on .
It may take minutes or days for this trap to reset .
It may just be a single use , but we have no way of knowing .
” Now Gyda laughed .
“ He means to say , ‘ Thank you , sylvari , for doing my job . ’
” Killeen ’s cheeks blushed a deeper green .
“ My apologies , ” she said to Dougal .
“ I did not mean to upstage you .
I did remove the trap without hurting anyone .
” Dougal grimaced .
He did n’t doubt that her apology was heartfelt , but that made it feel even worse .
He said , perhaps not as kindly as he could , “ You could have given us more fair warning , or time to back out of the explosion .
As it was , you could have brought the ceiling down on top of us .
” “ I see , ” Killeen said , thoughtful for a moment .
“ I did not intend to endanger our quest . ” “ Of course not , ” Dougal said , feeling bad for upbraiding her .
Despite himself , he could n’t help but enjoy her sincerity .
“ Perhaps it ’s the wonder of this place , ” the sylvari said , raising her chin once again .
“ It ’s fascinating .
To my people , death is an integral part of life .
We revere it wholly , even the darkest parts of it .
But we do n’t quite understand it — yet . ”
She gazed around the chamber , her eyes wide with wonder .
“ And even so , we would never build a monument like this to it . ”
“ It is not a monument to the dead but rather a testament to those who lived , ” Dougal said gently .
He felt his irritation ebbing away — toward her , at least .
“ Let ’s go . ”
Then , raising his voice to the others : “ Let ’s be careful moving forward .
We should see more traps like this .
” “ You are such an old woman , human , ” Gyda snorted .
“ My great - granddame Ulrica would not hesitate as much as you do , and she ’s been dead for seven years . ”
She kicked aside a pile of bones and held aloft a torch .
“ You worry too much .
What ’s life without danger ? ” “ Longer , ” Dougal said .
He followed the norn as she strode through the exploded room and into the chambers beyond .
He ’d worked with other norn before .
They were larger than life in many ways , but norn bullies were just like everyone else ’s .
Gyda ’s bluster was meant to cover some other deficiency .
Dougal did n’t mention the norn ’s own reluctance to enter the trapped room , despite her bragging .
“ Bah .
Such a life only seems longer , like a tasteless meal , ” concluded Gyda .
As Dougal followed her , he noticed that the air had grown slightly cooler .
Once they were all inside the next chamber , both he and the norn held their torches aloft .
The light found something thick and gray hanging among the bones at the apex of the room ’s high - arched ceiling .
Dougal held up a hand to shade his eyes against the torch and peered at the substance .
At first he thought it hanging moss , but suddenly it was clear what it was .
Webbing .
Dougal cursed .
He shouted out a warning , but Killeen ’s high - pitched scream behind him cut him off .
He spun about just in time to see the sylvari disappear into a hole in the ground .

DR Congo offensive against ADF rebels : ' Thousands flee ' Published duration 15 July 2010
image caption Nearly two million Congolese have been displaced from their homes in years of conflict in the east
About 40,000 people have fled their homes in the north - east of the Democratic Republic of Congo following fighting , UK charity Oxfam has said .
The violence erupted at the end of June when the army went on the offensive against Ugandan rebel group ADF - Nalu which is based in DR Congo .
An Oxfam spokeswoman told the BBC that whole villages had been burned down .
DR Congo agreed with Uganda earlier this year to go after all armed groups in the east of the country .
The offensive was intended to root out all " negative elements " , Kinshasa said at the time .
Eastern DR Congo , which has proliferation of rebel groups , has seen severe fighting in recent years and nearly two million people have been been forced from their homes .
The UN says some of those fleeing the recent fighting are heading towards the town of Beni in North Kivu province .
BBC Africa analyst Martin Plaut says ADF - Nalu members , who had been in the area for many years and were reported to have been living peacefully among the local villagers , reacted violently to the offensive .
" There are now skirmishes between the Congolese and the militia groups and my colleagues in the area tell me that they 're now estimating the number of displaced at 40,000 , " Oxfam 's Elli Kemp said .
She said the Congolese army is so poorly disciplined that any offensive is likely to be accompanied by rape , extortion and other atrocities .
According to the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa , the ADF - Nalu is a coalition of two armed movements opposed to the Ugandan government , which were mainly active in the 1990s .
Men More Affected than Woman by Ups and Downs of Relationships Guys have a harder time coping with relationship stress than women , study finds .
Jun. 11 , 2010  --
Contrary to popular belief , men are more affected by a rocky relationship than their female counterparts , according to new research from Wake Forest University .
Research shows that women have a harder time coping with a breakup , but the guys are the ones who feel more stress and strain when the relationship hits a rough patch , researchers found .
On the upside , men also get more of a psychological and emotional boost when the relationship is healthy .
" Common wisdom says that women are more hurt by problems in a relationship , " says Robin Simon , lead researcher on the study and a sociologist at Wake Forest , " but we found that the benefits of support [ in a relationship ] and the disadvantages of strain are exaggerated for the men . "
" Men are more sensitive than we often think they are , " she says .
For the study , Simon and co-author Anne Barrett , associate professor of sociology at Florida State University , drew on mental health and relationship data from over a thousand college - aged youths in south Florida .
They found that while men often put forth a brave front in the face of a faltering romance , they were hurting emotionally more than the women were -- they just did n't show it in the same way .
While women tend to get depressed when they are hurt or upset , men express their distress through substance use or abuse , Simon says .
In the study , the more relationship problems a guy had , the more likely he was to score high on substance abuse measures , including those that gauge emotional issues associated with drug dependence , she says .
These results may point to a societal shift in the way that young men today experience relationships , gender and relationship experts say .
" These boys are more likely to have experienced a divorce in their family , " Simon says , " and this might make them more sensitive to the ups and downs of a relationship .
They are more aware of the frailties of relationships than past generations . "
The study was published in the June edition of the Journal of Health and Social Behaviour .
Big Boys Don't Cry , They Drink
Though these findings run counter to popular wisdom about the way men handle their relationships , gender and relationship experts were not surprised by these results .
" Women are more naturally expressive , " says Audrey Nelson , author of " Code Switching : How to Talk so Men Will Listen . "
" We 'll cry , show our feelings – when a women is having a hard time , she has two or three friends she can talk to , to ease the pain .
Men have the same feelings and emotions , but they have no outlet . "
" One of the ten commandments of " masculinity " is ' thou shalt not be vulnerable , ' " she says , " so they self - medicate the feelings with drugs and alcohol and drown their vulnerability , rejection , sadness . "
Nelson says the difference between the sexes has to do with both how women and men are wired neurologically and taught socially .
Research shows that the region of a woman 's brain related to compassion and empathy is larger than a man's , she says , so " straight out of the womb she 's more nurturing . "
Then , society trains girls to express their feelings -- though not their anger , she notes -- while men are taught not to cry , not to show vulnerability .
In fact , she says " the only sanctioned emotion for men to express publicly is anger .
It 's no surprise that men turn to alcohol to numb the [ unwanted ] emotions . "
Today 's Boys : Generation Vexed ?
The young men in the study were more likely to have " mothers employed outside the home , fathers absent or dependent on the mother 's income , or a child of divorce " than past generations , Simon says .
This may be at the heart of why young men today may be more sensitive to the trials of a relationship , she says .
Alternatively , Frances Cohen Praver , an author and psychologist in Locust Valley , New York , says the gender difference might be because women are less sensitive to these issues today .
" Women are more autonomous and independent .
They need to love and be loved , but they can get love from their friends and family , " she says .
This might also be why men in the study benefited more from the support of a healthy romantic relationship -- because they were getting support they otherwise would n't get .
But the issue cannot be explained by the social support element alone , Simon warns .
" We can't tease out whether it 's their emotional development at this time in their life , or if it 's this generation , or what , " she says .
So as for what causes these emotional gender differences , " That 's the million dollar question , " she says .
T- Mobile USA ’s version of the Samsung Galaxy S , the Samsung Vibrant , has apparently leaked , albeit only in press image form .
According to Cell Phone Signal these are preview shots of the Super AMOLED smartphone , complete with T - Mobile branding and a tweaked control row underneath the touchscreen .
Those changed controls seemingly dump the hardware “ home ” key from the Galaxy S we unboxed late last week and uses the space to instead fit in two more touch - sensitive keys : home and search .
T - Mobile ’s branding is across the top of the device , but we ’re a little confused by the Galaxy S name emblazoned across the back , which you ’d think would read “ Vibrant ” if anything .
According to the latest rumors , T - Mobile are preparing to launch the Vibrant on July 21st .

An American geologist was sentenced to eight years in prison in China today on charges of stealing state secrets by brokering the sale of an oil industry database , in a case which has provoked widespread dismay .
Xue Feng was arrested more than two and a half years ago and supporters allege that state security agents tortured him .
They say the database was publicly available and classified only after its sale , underlining concerns about China 's broad , opaque and ambiguous state secrets law .
In an unusually high - profile show of concern , US ambassador Jon Huntsman attended the Beijing people 's intermediate court for Xue 's sentencing .
The embassy later released a statement urging China to release and deport the 44 - year - old naturalised US citizen .
Huntsman has visited Xue several times and Barack Obama raised the case with China 's president , Hu Jintao , when he visited last year .
Xue 's defence lawyer , Tong Wei , said the sentence was " very heavy " and that he would discuss a possible appeal with his client .
The recommended legal limit is 10 years for all but extremely serious violations .
The court also fined Xue 200,000 yuan ( £ 19,500 ) .
Three Chinese nationals were also convicted .
Li Yongbo , a manager at Beijing Licheng Zhongyou Oil Technology Development Company , was also jailed for eight years and fined 200,000 yuan .
Chen Mengjin and Li Dongxu , who worked for research institutes affiliated with state - owned PetroChina , were each jailed for two and a half years and fined 50,000 yuan .
Chinese - born Xue , who studied in Chicago and lived in Houston , brokered the sale of a database prepared by a Chinese firm and containing detailed information on the mainly state - run Chinese oil industry .
" Both Xue and IHS Energy [ the US consultancy Xue worked for ] have stated that they believed that the database was a commercially available product .
After Xue purchased the database , it was subsequently classified as a state secret , " the US - based The Dui Hua foundation , which supports the rights of prisoners , said in a statement .
" This is a very harsh sentence .
It 's a very sad day for justice in China , " added John Kamm , its executive director .
" It 's a huge disappointment and will send very real shivers up the spines of businesses that do business in China . "
Xue came to trial last year at around the time a naturalised Australian , Stern Hu , and three Chinese colleagues at Rio Tinto were detained on similar charges in a case that sparked widespread outrage .
They were subsequently convicted of receiving bribes and stealing commercial secrets .
According to draft regulations released by the government this spring , commercial secrets of major state - owned enterprises are deemed state secrets .
Xue 's case sparked particular concern because supporters say state security agents tortured him in the early weeks of his detention , stubbing out lit cigarettes on his arms and hitting him on the head with an ashtray .
Jerome Cohen , an expert in Chinese law who has advised Xue 's wife , said the evidence was so weak the prosecutor returned the case to police twice , and the court twice returned it to prosecutors .
He also criticised the length of the legal process ; Xue stood trial a year ago .
Cohen warned of " increasingly apparent , visible signs of lawlessness " in the way the authorities handled cases .
He pointed to other recent detentions including that of Gao Zhisheng , a high - profile rights lawyer , who recently emerged after almost a year 's disappearance , but vanished again weeks later .
Some believe that the case 's low profile adversely affected Xue .
It took two years to become public because although he wanted publicity his wife , who lives in the US , feared it would be counter - productive and might have repercussions for her relatives in China .
The US state department initially sought to raise the issue behind closed doors .
His wife , Nan Kang , told Associated Press : " I can't describe how I feel .
It 's definitely unacceptable . "
The couple have two children .
The traditional boundary you have with licenses is that you always are required to get approval before you move forward and that 's really complicated .
The great thing about The Old Republic is that , because we 're setting the game in the Star Wars timeline well before any of the events in the movies take place , we have a lot of latitude .
We 're also working collaboration with the people at LucasArts , who have been really great to work with .
There 's been a lot of good back and forth with them .
So we do n't really feel constrained at all in the way some developers can do when they 're dealing with licensed properties .
We kind of have the best of both worlds with The Old Republic .
We have the benefit of the iconic license with a lot of flexibility .
We 've also actually create – and this also happened with Knights Of The Old Republic – some of the prehistory of Star Wars .
So really , we have a best case scenario with Star Wars and LucasArts , and of course , the main beneficiaries of that are the fans .
In an unexpected update to his last blog post titled “ Meh ” , Geohot has announced that he , for the time being at least has kind of abandoned the whole iPhone jailbreak and unlock scene .
The reasons according to him are as follows .
Sorry , this post was probably a bad idea .
Next time I wo n’t say anything .
I miss when this blog was actually about technical things ( I ’ve been reacting too much to the feedback , which led it to the place it ’s in now ) .
I did n’t fully realize most of the current scene do n’t care unless they are getting something .
Now I do .
It ’s late tonight , I ’ll think about what to do about this in the morning .
The real reason behind no release is n’t technical .
It ’s just that it will never stop , after blackra1n , people demand unlock , after blacksn0w , people demand untethered .
I miss the days when jailbreaking and unlocking were difficult , it attracted a much higher caliber crowd .
Also , to the haters , the picture is quite obviously fake 😀
While I respect this guy for all his contributions in the past , and I understand the reasons he has put in , there is still something about this whole story which makes me wonder if Apple has something to do with this .
Maybe he was offered money ? , or maybe he was threatened with criminal charges for continuing ?
well who knows .
He showed off a untethered jailbreak for new iPhone and iPod touches back in March , followed by a jailbreak for iPad and iOS 4 Beta in April , but none of them ever saw light of day makes no sense to me .
For those of you who do n’t know , George Hotz ( Geohot ) is the guy who first unlocked the original iPhone in 2007 , followed by first jailbreak for iPhone 3GS , and then later he was the first one to provide all - in - one jailbreak / unlock solution for iPhone 3.1.2 firmware through his famous tool , named blackra1n and blacksn0w .
So where does that leave us – the iPhone 4 , iPhone 3GS ( new bootrom ) and iPod touch 3G users ?
Well , Comex ’s Spirit like jailbreak tool is now the only hope .
It will probably be released once Apple rolls out the new iOS 4.0.1 / 4.1 firmware update for iPhone 4 , 3GS and 3G .
UPDATE 1 : Geohot shuts down his iPhone public for public .
His blog now requires private invite in order to read the content .
This is what he said on Twitter :
i was just having fun but some people had to take this all way too seriously .
it ’s just a phone , and it is n’t much fun anymore .
my bio is n’t " iPhone hacker " it was just something i did occasionally when i was bored .
seriously , i think many of you care way more than me it was a cool ride , and i’ve learned a lot about a lot .
perhaps one of these days i’ll do a more formal goodbye .

A Cosmic Zoo in the Large Magellanic Cloud
Astronomers often turn their telescopes to the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) , one of the closest galaxies to our own Milky Way , in their quest to understand the Universe .
In this spectacular new image from the Wide Field Imager ( WFI ) at ESO ’s La Silla Observatory in Chile , a celestial menagerie of different objects and phenomena in part of the LMC is on display , ranging from vast globular clusters to the remains left by brilliant supernovae explosions .
This fascinating observation provides data for a wide variety of research projects unravelling the life and death of stars and the evolution of galaxies .
The Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) is only about 160 000 light - years from our own Milky Way — very close on a cosmic scale .
This proximity makes it a very important target as it can be studied in far more detail than more distant systems .
The LMC lies in the constellation of Dorado ( the Swordfish ) , deep in the southern sky and well placed for observations from ESO ’s observatories in Chile .
It is one of the galaxies forming the Local Group surrounding the Milky Way [ 1 ] .
Though enormous on a human scale , the LMC is less than one tenth the mass of our home galaxy and spans just 14 000 light - years compared to about 100 000 light - years for the Milky Way .
Astronomers refer to it as an irregular dwarf galaxy [ 2 ] .
Its irregularity , combined with its prominent central bar of stars suggests to astronomers that tidal interactions with the Milky Way and fellow Local Group galaxy , the Small Magellanic Cloud , could have distorted its shape from a classic barred spiral into its modern , more chaotic form .
This image is a mosaic of four pictures from the Wide Field Imager on the MPG / ESO 2.2 - metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile .
The image covers a region of sky more than four times as large as the full Moon .
The huge field of view of this camera makes it possible to see a very wide range of objects in the LMC in a single picture , although only a small part of the entire galaxy can be included .
Dozens of clusters of young stars can be seen as well as traces of glowing gas clouds .
Huge numbers of faint stars fill the image from edge to edge and in the background , more galaxies , far beyond the LMC , are visible .
Globular clusters are collections of hundreds of thousands to millions of stars bound by gravity into a roughly spherical shape just a few light - years across .
Many clusters orbit the Milky Way and most are ancient , over ten billion years old , and composed mainly of old red stars .
The LMC also has globular clusters and one is visible as the fuzzy white oval cluster of stars in the upper right part of the image .
This is NGC 1978 , an unusually massive globular cluster .
Unlike most other globular clusters , NGC 1978 is believed to be just 3.5 billion years old .
The presence of this kind of object in the LMC leads astronomers to think that the LMC has a more recent history of active star formation than our own Milky Way .
As well as being a vigorous region of star birth , the LMC has also seen many spectacular stellar deaths in the form of brilliant supernova explosions .
At the top right of the image , the remnant of one such supernova , a strangely shaped wispy cloud called DEM L 190 , often also referred to as N 49 , can be seen .
This giant cloud of glowing gas is the brightest supernova remnant in the LMC , and is about 30 light - years across .
At the centre , where the star once burned , now lies a magnetar , a neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field .
It was only in 1979 that satellites orbiting Earth detected a powerful gamma-ray burst from this object , drawing attention to the extreme properties of this new class of stellar exotica created by supernova explosions .
This part of the Large Magellanic Cloud is so packed with star clusters and other objects that astronomers can spend entire careers exploring it .
With so much activity , it is easy to see why astronomers are so keen to study the strange creatures in this heavenly zoo .

C# has three mathematical constants that look like constants in the C header file float.h .
Two of these are not what you might expect .
The constant double .
MaxValue in C# looks like the constant DBL_MAX in C , and indeed it is .
Both give the maximum finite value of a double , which is on the order of 10^308 .
This might lead you to believe that double .
MinValue in C# is the same as DBL_MIN in C or that double .
Epsilon in C# is the same as DBL_EPSILON .
If so , you ’re in for a surprise .
The constants DBL_MAX and double .
MaxValue are the same because there is no ambiguity over what “ max ” means : the largest finite value of a double .
But DBL_MIN and double .
MinValue are different because they minimize over different ranges .
The constant DBL_MIN is the smallest positive value of a normalized double .
The constant double .
MinValue in C# is the smallest ( i.e. most negative ) value of a double and is the negative of double .
MaxValue .
The difference between DBL_MIN and double .
MinValue is approximately the difference between 10^- 308 and - 10^308 , between a very small positive number and a very large negative number .
C has a constant DBL_EPSILON for the smallest positive double precision number x such that 1 + x does not equal 1 in machine precision .
Typically a double has about 15 figures of precision , and so DBL_EPSILON is on the order of 10 ^ - 16 .
( For a more precise description , see Anatomy of a floating point number . )
You might expect double .
Epsilon in C# corresponds to DBL_EPSILON in C.
I did , until a unit test failed on some numerical code I was porting from C++ to C#.
But in C# double .
Epsilon is the smallest positive value a ( denormalized ) double can take .
It is similar to DBL_MIN , except that double .
Epsilon is the possible smallest value of a double , not requiring normalization .
The constant DBL_MIN is on the order of 10^ - 308 while double .
Epsilon is on the order of 10^ - 324 because it allows denormalized values .
( See Anatomy of a floating point number for details of denormalized numbers . )
Incidentally , the C constants DBL_MAX , DBL_MIN , and DBL_EPSILON equal the return values of max , min , and epsilon for the C++ class numeric_limits < double > .
To summarize ,
double .
MaxValue in C# equals DBL_MAX in C .
in C# equals in C. double .
MinValue in C# equals - DBL_MAX in C .
in C# equals in C. double .
Epsilon is similar to DBL_MIN in C , but orders of magnitude smaller .
is similar to in C , but orders of magnitude smaller .
C# has no analog of DBL_EPSILON from C .
One could argue that the C# names are better than the C names .
It makes sense for double .
MinValue to be the negative of double .
MaxValue .
But the use of Epsilon was a mistake .
The term “ epsilon ” in numeric computing has long been established and is not limited to C .
It would have been better if Microsoft had used the name MinPositiveValue to be more explicit and not conflict with established terminology .

The history of the Buddhism begins with the enlightenment of the Buddha .
At the age of thirty - five , he awakened from the sleep of delusion that grips all beings in an endless vicious cycle of ignorance and unnecessary suffering ( around 528 BCE ) .
Having awakened , he decided to “ go against the current ” and communicate his liberating wakefulness to suffering beings — that is , to teach the Dharma .
For forty - five years , he crossed and recrossed central India on foot conveying his profound , brilliant wakefulness directly as well as by means of explanations that grew into a great body of spiritual , psychological , and practical doctrine .
His enlightenment as well as the doctrine leading to it have been passed down through numerous unbroken lineages of teachers , which have spread to many countries .
Many of these lineages still flourish .
At the time of the Buddha ’s death ( ca. 483 BCE ) , his Dharma was well established in central India .
There were many lay followers , but the heart of the Dharma community were the monastics , many of whom were arhats [ worthy ones , who attain Nirvana at the end of this lifetime ] .
Numerous monasteries had already been built round about such large cities as Rajagriha , Shravasti , and Vaishali .
The first to assume the Buddha ’s mantle , tradition tells , was his disciple Mahakashyapa , who had the duty of establishing an authoritative version of the Buddha ’s teachings .
Thus , during the first rainy season after the Buddha ’s death ( parinirvana ) , Mahakashyapa convoked an assembly of five hundred arhats .
At this assembly , it is said , Ananda , the Buddha ’s personal attendant , recited all of the master ’s discourses ( sutras ) , naming the place where each was given and describing the circumstances .
A monk named Upali recited all the rules and procedures the Buddha had established for the conduct of monastic life .
Mahakashyapa himself recited the matrika , lists of terms organized to provide analytical synopses of the teachings given in the sutras .
These three extensive recitations , reviewed and verified by the assembly , became the basis for the Sutra Pitaka ( Discourse Basket ) , the Vinaya Pitaka ( Discipline Basket ) , and Abhidharma Pitaka ( Special Teachings Basket ) , respectively .
The Tripitaka ( all three together ) is the core of the Buddhist scriptures .
This assembly , held at Rajagriha with the patronage of the Magadhan king Ajatashatru , is called the First Council .
In the early centuries after the Buddha ’s death , the Buddha Dharma spread throughout India and became a main force in the life of its peoples .
Its strength lay in its realized ( arhat ) teachers and large monasteries that sheltered highly developed spiritual and intellectual communities .
Monks traveled frequently between the monasteries , binding them into a powerful network .
As the Dharma spread to different parts of India , differences emerged , particularly regarding the Vinaya , or rules of conduct .
Roughly a hundred years after the First Council , such discrepancies led to a Second Council in Vaishali , in which seven hundred arhats censured ten points of lax conduct on the part of the local monks , notably the acceptance of donations of gold and silver .
In spite of this council and other efforts to maintain unity , gradually , perhaps primarily because of size alone , the Sangha divided into divergent schools .
Among the principal schools was a conservative faction , the Sthaviravada ( way of the elders ) , which held firmly to the old monastic ideal with the arhat at its center and to the original teaching of the Buddha as expressed in the Tripitaka .
Another school , the Mahasanghikas , asserted the fallibility of arhats .
It sought to weaken the authority of the monastic elite and open the Dharma gates to the lay community .
In this , as well as in certain metaphysical doctrines , the Mahasanghikas prefigured the Mahayana .
Another important school was that of the Sarvastivadins ( from Sanskrit sarva asti , “ all exists ” ) , who held the divergent view that past , present , and future realities all exist .
In all , eighteen schools with varying shades of opinion on points of doctrine or discipline developed by the end of the third century BCE .
However , all considered themselves part of the spiritual family of the Buddha and in general were accepted as such by the others .
It was not rare for monks of different schools to live or travel together .
According to the Sthaviravadin tradition ( known in Pali as the Theravada ) , which continues today in Southeast Asia , a Third Council took place in the time of King Ashoka ( r. 276-232 BCE ) at which the king declared the Sthaviravadin teachings the standard from which all other schools deviated .
Perhaps in reaction to this , the Sarvastivadins gradually migrated to the west .
They established a bastion in the city of Mathura , from which their influence continued to spread .
Over centuries , they dominated the northwest , including all of Kashmir and much of Central Asia .
Today a Sarvastivadin Vinaya lineage still survives in all the schools of Tibetan Buddhism .
King Ashoka was the third emperor of the Mauryan empire , which covered all of the Indian subcontinent but its southern tip .
His personal espousal of the Dharma and adoption of its principles for the governance of his immense realm meant a quantum leap in the spread of the Buddha ’s teaching .
The imperial government promulgated the teachings .
It supported the monasteries and sent proselytizing missions to the Hellenic states of the northwest and to Southeast Asia .
Under King Ashoka , institutions of compassion and nonviolence were established throughout much of India .
These include peaceful relations with all neighboring states , hospitals and animal hospitals , special officials to oversee the welfare of local populations , and shady rest stops for travelers .
Thus he remains today the paragon of a Buddhist ruler , and his reign is looked back upon by Buddhists as a golden age .
The Mauryan empire soon fragmented , but the Buddha Dharma continued as a dominant force throughout India in the early centuries of the common era .
The kings of the Satavahana dynasty of central India followed Ashoka in adopting the Dharma as a civilizing and unifying force in governing disparate peoples .
King Kanishka ( r. first - second centuries ) , whose vast Kushan empire , centered on Gandhara , encompassed northern India and large parts of Central Asia , was a champion of the Dharma , hailed as a second Ashoka .
Under his patronage , a Fourth Council was held , at which major new commentaries on the Tripitaka were written , largely under Sarvastivadin influence .
Under Kanishka , the Buddha Dharma was firmly planted among the Central Asian peoples whose homelands lay along the Silk Route , whence the way lay open to China .
The Kushan empire also saw the flowering of Gandharan art , which under Hellenistic influences produced Buddha images of extraordinary nobility and beauty .
Traditional accounts of the Fourth Council say that the assembly was composed of arhats under the leadership of the arhat Parshva but also under the accomplished bodhisattva Vasumitra .
Indeed it was at this time , about the beginning of the second century , that the way of the bodhisattva , or the Mahayana ( Great Vehicle ) , appeared .
It was this form of the Buddha Dharma that was to conquer the north , including China , Japan , Korea , Tibet , and Mongolia .
The most visible manifestation of the Mahayana was a new wave of sutras , scriptures claiming to be the word of the Buddha that had remained hidden until then in other realms of existence .
The Mahayana replaced the ideal of the arhat with that of the bodhisattva .
Whereas arhats sought to end confusion in themselves in order to escape samsara , bodhisattvas vowed to end confusion in themselves yet remain in samsara to liberate all other sentient beings .
The vision of spiritual life broadened beyond the controlled circumstances of cloister and study to include the wide - open situations of the world .
Correspondingly , the notion of “ buddha ” was no longer limited to a series of historical personages , the last of whom was Shakyamuni [ Siddhartha Gautama ] , but referred also to a fundamental self - existing principle of spiritual wakefulness or enlightenment .
While continuing to accept the old Tripitaka , Mahayanists regarded it as a restricted expression of the Buddha ’s teaching , and they characterized those who held to it exclusively as Hinayanists ( adherents of the Hinayana , the Small Vehicle ) .
Great masters shaped the Mahayana in the early centuries of the common era .
Outstanding among them all was Nagarjuna ( fl. second or third century ) , whose name connects him with the nagas ( serpent deities ) from whose hidden realm he is said to have retrieved the Prajnaparamita sutras , foundational Mahayana scriptures [ see pages 177 - 213 ] .
Nagarjuna was born in South India and became the head of Nalanda , the great Buddhist university ) a few miles north of Rajagriha , which was a major stronghold of the Dharma for a thousand years .
Nagarjuna ’s commentaries and treatises expounded the teachings of the Madhyamaka ( Middle Way ) , one of the two main Mahayana schools .
Another great master was Asanga ( fl. fourth century ) , who founded the other main school , the Yogachara , which focused on experience as the ultimate principle .
Through most of the Gupta period ( c. 300 - c. 600 ) , the Buddha Dharma flourished unhindered in India .
In the sixth century , however , hundreds of Buddhist monasteries were destroyed by invading Huns under King Mihirakula .
This was a serious blow , but the Dharma revived and flourished once again , mainly in northeastern India under the Pala kings ( eighth - twelfth centuries ) .
These Buddhist kings patronized the monasteries and built new scholastic centers such as Odantapuri near the Ganges some miles east of Nalanda .
Though the Hinayana had largely vanished from India by the seventh century , in this last Indian period the Mahayana continued , and yet another form — known as Mantrayana , Vajrayana , or Tantra — became dominant .
Like the Mahayana , the Vajrayana ( Diamond Vehicle ) was based on a class of scriptures ultimately attributed to the Buddha , in this case known as Tantras .
Vajrayanists regarded the Hinayana and Mahayana as successive stages on the way to the tantric level .
The Vajrayana leaped yet further than the Mahayana in acceptance of the world , holding that all experiences , including the sensual , are sacred manifestations of awakened mind , the buddha principle .
It emphasized liturgical methods of meditation , or sadhanas , in which the practitioner identified with deities symbolizing various aspects of awakened mind .
The palace of the deity , identical with the phenomenal world as a whole , was known as a mandala .
In the place of the arhat and the bodhisattva , the Vajrayana placed the siddha , the realized tantric master .
By the thirteenth century , largely as a result of violent suppression by Islamic conquerors , the Buddha Dharma was practically extinct in the land of its birth .
However , by this time Hinayana forms were firmly ensconced in Southeast Asia , and varieties of Mahayana and Vajrayana in most of the rest of Asia .
China
The Mahayana entered China through Central Asia at the beginning of the common era .
At first it was confused with indigenous Taoism , whose terms it had to borrow .
The Kuchean monk Kumarajiva ( 344-413 ) , brought to China as a prisoner of war , created a new level of precision in Chinese Buddhism .
His lucid translation and teaching resulted in the formation of the Chinese Madhyamaka school ( San - Iun , Three Treatises ) .
Paramartha ( 499-569 ) was another great translator and teacher .
His work made possible the development of the Fa-hsiang , or Chinese Yogachara , school .
Buddha Dharma ’s golden age in China was the T’ang period ( 618-907 ) .
Monasteries were numerous and powerful and had the support of the emperors .
During this time the other main Chinese Dharma schools — Hua-yen , T’ien - t’ai , Ch’an , Pure Land , and the tantric Mi-tsung — made their appearance .
In 845 , however , came a major persecution of the Dharma community , and the monasteries had to be evacuated .
Thereafter the Buddha Dharma in China never recovered its former glory .
The Sung period ( 960 - 1279 ) was a time of blending Taoist , Buddhist , and Confucian ideas and methods .
Under the Ming dynasty ( 1368 -1662 ) , a fusion of Ch’an and Pure Land opened the way for a strong lay movement .
During the Ch’ing period ( 1663-1908 ) , the Tibetan Vajrayana made its mark on Chinese Buddhism , mainly through the imperial courts .
Communist rule in the twentieth century reduced the Dharma community to a remnant , but in Taiwan the Dharma flourished , predominantly in Pure Land and other popular forms .
Korea
Buddha Dharma came to Korea from China in the fourth century CE .
It flourished after the Silla unification in the seventh century .
By the tenth century there were Korean versions of most Chinese schools .
Paramount were Ch’ao , Hua-yen , and a Vajrayana form related to the Chinese Mi-tsung .
The heyday of Korean Dharma was the Koryo period ( 932-1392 ) , during which the comprehensive Tripitaka Koreana was published .
Under the Yi dynasty ( 1392 -1910 ) , Confucianism became the state religion and the Buddha Dharma was forced into the background .
A revival came after the end of Japanese rule in 1945 , when the Won movement , a popular Buddhism much influenced by Ch’an , came to the fore .
Nowadays , a kind of syncretic Buddhism is widespread in Korea .
Japan
The Buddha Dharma was brought to japan from Korea in 522 .
It received its major impetus from the regent prince Shotoku ( r. 593-621 ) , a Japanese Ashoka .
He established Buddhism as the state religion of Japan , founded monasteries , and himself wrote important commentaries on the sutras .
Initially , it was primarily the Sanron ( San - Iun , Madhyamaka ) school that spread .
In the ninth century , six Japanese schools , originally brought from China — Kosha , Hosso , Sanron , Jojitsu , Ritsu , and Kegon — were officially recognized , with the imperial house adopting the Kegon Dharma .
During the latter part of the Heian period ( 794-1184 ) , the Tendai and tantric Shingon schools became predominant .
From the tenth to fourteenth centuries , various Pure Land sects began to prosper .
Zen ( Ch’an ) came to Japan from China toward the end or the twelfth century , and remained a vital force in Japanese cultural life ever after ; Soto and Rinzai are its two main schools .
After the appearance of the Nichiren school in the thirteenth century , no further movements developed until modern times .
All Japanese schools assimilated aspects of indigenous Shinto kami [ deities inhabiting nature ) and ancestor worship .
Since World War II , various modernizing lay movements such as Soka - gakkai and Rissho Kosei - kai have developed .
Japan today boasts an unparalleled variety or Buddhist sects .
Tibet
The Buddha Dharma of Tibet ( and Himalayan countries such as Sikkim , Bhutan , and Ladakh ) preserved and developed the Vajrayana tradition of late Indian Buddhism and joined it with the Sarvastivadin monastic rule .
The first spreading of Buddhism was initiated by King Trisong Detsen ( 755-797 ) , who invited to Tibet the Indian pandit [ learned man ]
Shantarakshita , notable for his brilliant synthesis of the Madhayamaka and Yogachara , and the great Indian siddha Padmasambhava .
The tradition of the Nyingma school stems from this time .
After a period of persecution , a second spreading came in the eleventh century , resulting in the foundation of the Kagyu and Shakya schools .
A major part of Indian Buddhist writings were translated to form the Tibetan canon , which included tantric scriptures and commentaries , preserving many texts otherwise lost .
In the fourteenth century , a reform movement resulted in the formation of the Gelukpa school , the fourth of the principal schools of Tibetan Buddhism .
By the late twentieth century , as a result of Chinese repression Buddhism in Tibet was reduced to a vestige , but it remained in Sikkim and Bhutan .
Centers of Tibetan Buddhism also developed in northern India and Nepal as well as in Europe , Australia , and North America .
Mongolia
The Mongols were definitively converted to Tibetan Buddhism in the sixteenth century .
Scriptures and liturgies were translated into Mongolian , and the four principal Tibetan schools flourished until the Communist takeover of the twentieth century .
Vietnam
Vietnam lay under Chinese influence , and the Chinese Mahayana sects of Ch’an ( Thien ) and Pure Land ( Tindo ) were well established in the country by the end of the first millennium .
Theravada was introduced b the Khmers but remained largely confined to areas along the Cambodian border .
A modern social - action – oriented movement fusing the two Mahayana sects began in Saigon in 1932 .
In 1963 Theravadans joined this movement , and a United Buddhist Congregation of Vietnam existed fleetingly .
Today Buddhists in Vietnam remain intensely involved in politics and social action .
Burma ( Myanmar )
Emissaries sent by King Ashoka in the third century BCE first brought the Dharma to Burma .
By the fifth century , the Theravada was well - established , and by the seventh century the Mahayana had appeared in regions near the Chinese border .
By the eighth century , the Vajrayana was also present , and all three forms continued to coexist until King Anaratha established the Theravada throughout the land in the eleventh century .
Pagan , the royal capital in the north , adorned with thousands upon thousands of Buddhist stupas and temples , and was the principal bastion of Buddha Dharma on earth until sacked by the Mongols in 1287 .
In succeeding centuries the Theravada continued strong , interacting closely at times with the Dharma centers of Ceylon [ Sri Lanka ] .
The Burmese form of Theravada acquired a unique flavor through its assimilation of folk beliefs connected with spirits of all kinds known as nats .
Today 85 percent of Burmese are Buddhist , and Buddhism is the official religion of the country .
Cambodia ( Kampuchea )
The Buddhism of the Sarvastivadin school spread to Cambodia in the third century BCE and reached a high point in the fifth and sixth centuries .
By the end of the eighth century , elements of Mahayana had also appeared .
Succeeding centuries brought a fusion of Buddha Dharma with Shaivite Hinduism .
In the fourteenth century , however , the Theravada was firmly imposed on the country by the royal house , and it has remained dominant .
In 1955 Prince Norodom Sihanouk sought to unite the country under the banner of king , Dharma , and socialism .
Sri Lanka ( Ceylon )
In the third century BCE , King Devanampiya Tissa turned to Theravada Buddhism .
The Sinhalese king built the Mahavihara monastery and there enshrined a branch of the Bodhi Tree that had been brought from India .
For more than two millennia since that time , the Mahavihara has been a powerful force in the Buddhism of Ceylon and other countries of Southeast Asia , notably Burma and Thailand .
The Theravada in Ceylon remains the oldest continuous Dharma tradition anywhere in the world .
Nonetheless , factions reflecting the influence of other Indian or Theravada schools played a significant role .
These centered around other great Sinhalese monasteries such as the Abhayagirivihara and the Jetavanavihara .
Mahayana and tantric influences are also traceable , and Tamil Hinduism had an ongoing influence outside the monasteries .
Associated with the Mahavihara was the preeminent teacher and writer Buddhaghosha ( fl. fourth - fifth centuries ) , whose great Vishuddimagga ( Path of Purity ) gives a definitive account of the Theravada .
In the twelfth century King Parakkambahu forcibly imposed the Mahaviharan brand of Theravada on the entire country .
The attempted conversion of the country to Christianity by Portuguese and Dutch colonists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries greatly weakened the Dharma in Ceylon but made it a rallying point for Sinhalese nationalism .
In the following centuries Sinhalese kings turned to Burma and Thailand to refresh Sinhalese monastic lineages .
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , many Europeans came to the aid of Sinhalese Buddhism .
By the time of independence in 1948 , the Theravada was again thriving in Ceylon and exercising significant influence beyond its borders .
Thailand
Some form of Hinayana Buddhism arrived in Thailand from Burma in about the sixth century ; however , the Mahayana seems to have been dominant between the eighth and thirteenth centuries .
From the eleventh century , Hinduist Khmers were a major factor in many regions of the country .
In the thirteenth century , however , the Thai royal house established Theravada Buddhism as the national religion .
Eventually , the Khmers were converted to Theravada and became strong supporters .
In the nineteenth century , the reformist Dhammayut school , characterized by strict adherence to Vinaya discipline , arose under royal influence .
Today it remains the dominant element in Thai Buddhism and has also influenced other countries of Southeast Asia .
Ninety - five percent of the Thai population is Buddhist .
The Western World
Over the last two hundred years many Western intellectuals were drawn to and influenced by Buddhism .
The exotic profundity of Buddhist thought inspired philosophers like Arthur Schopenhauer and Henri Bergson .
In the twentieth century there has been considerable attention to Buddha Dharma in academic circles , and fairly accurate translations of Buddhist texts have gradually become available since the 1930s .
A new level of understanding has come about since the 1950s as authentic Asian meditation masters have established themselves in Western countries and taken on serious Western students .
Theravada Buddhism has had a significant impact since the 1930s , Zen since the 1950s , and the tantric Buddhism of Tibet since the 1970s .
Recently Westerners have begun assuming leadership in age - old Asian lineages .
Of course , significant numbers of Asian Buddhists have reached the West as part of immigrant populations .
But thus far there has been little crossover of Buddha Dharma from this source into host cultures .

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele on Friday declared his opposition to the Afghanistan war , saying the nine - year - old conflict was of President " Obama 's choosing , " and that the mission is " probably a lost cause " – prompting at least one prominent Republican to call for his resignation .
Steele made the comments at a fundraiser in Connecticut just two days after the Senate unanimously confirmed Gen. David Petraeus as the new U.S. commander in Afghanistan .
Petraeus is taking over for Gen. Stanley McChrystal , who was ousted over his and his aides ' scornful remarks of Obama 's national security team to Rolling Stone magazine , at a time when America 's casualty rate in the war is at record high and the offensive is falling short of expectations .
" This was a war of Obama 's choosing , " Steele said .
" This is not something United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in . "
The war in Afghanistan began shortly after the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , in the first year of President George W. Bush 's first term .
Obama , at the time , was a state senator in Illinois .
" It was [ Obama ] who was trying to be cute by half by flipping a script demonizing Iraq , while saying the battle really should be in Afghanistan , " Steele said in his delivery , which was posted on YouTube .
" Well , if he 's such a student of history , has he not understood that you know that 's the one thing you do n't do , is engage in land war in Afghanistan ?
All right , because everyone who has tried , over a thousand years of history , has failed . "
Steele 's comments led William Kristol , editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard , to call upon the GOP chairman to resign over the July 4 weekend as " an act of service for the country you love . "
" At a time when Gen . Petraeus has just taken over command , when Republicans in Congress are pushing for a clean war funding resolution , when Republicans around the country are doing their best to rally their fellow citizens behind the mission , your comment is more than an embarrassment , " Kristrol said in a letter to Steele .
" It 's an affront , both to the honor of the Republican Party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission they 've been asked to take on by our elected leaders , " he wrote .
" There are , of course , those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan , and they 're certainly entitled to make their case , " Kristol added .
" But one of them should n't be the chairman of the Republican Party . "
Erick Erickson , the editor of the popular conservative website RedState.com and an opinion driver among younger Republicans , also called for Steele 's ouster .
" Michael Steele must resign .
He has lost all moral authority to lead the GOP , " Erickson said .
Fox News contributor Karl Rove , a senior White House adviser to former President George W. Bush called Steele 's comments " boneheaded , " saying the Afghanistan war was " chosen for us by the people who ran Afghanistan -- the Taliban and their allies , Al Qaeda . "
Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse said it was " simply unconscionable that Michael Steele would undermine the morale of our troops when what they need is our support and encouragement .
Michael Steele would do well to remember that we are not in Afghanistan by our own choosing , that we were attacked and that his words have consequences . "
Steele sought later to clarify his comments by noting that Obama said on the presidential campaign trail that the U.S. should concentrate fighting the war on terror in Afghanistan , not Iraq .
" Now , as president , he has indeed shifted his focus to this region , " he said in a written statement .
" That means this is his strategy .
And , for the sake of security of the free world , our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war . "
" As we have learned throughout history , winning a war in Afghanistan is a difficult task , " he added .
" We must also remember that after the tragedy of Sept. 11 , 2001 , it is also a necessary one .
That is why I supported the decision to increase our troop force and , like the entire United States Senate , I support Gen. Petraeus ' confirmation .
The stakes are too high for us to accept anything but success in Afghanistan . "
Steele has been prone to gaffes that have enraged congressional Republicans .
In the last year , he predicted the GOP wo n't win House control this fall .
He also drew GOP ire when he criticized fellow Republicans in a book that party leaders did n't know he was writing until it was published .
His GOP critics were irked further when he told them to " get a life " and " shut up . "
Earlier this year , his oversight of the RNC was called into question because of lavish spending , including money to entertain donors at a lesbian bondage club in Los Angeles .

Holland , Netherlands and the Dutch
Posted by James Briggs on March 08 , 2004
Recently in The Times Q&A section a question was asked about Netherlands vs Holland as the correct name for that country .
The answer said that Holland strictly refers only to two southern provinces .
Nederlands is the official name and appears on currency and stamps .
Incidenatlly , in spite of this , the locals still shout for Holland at international football matches !
Later , a supplementary question was published .
Today , that following extra question was answered .
I found it interesting and thought I 'd share it .
**********************************************
I was interested to read about Holland and the Netherlands ( Q&A , February 25 ) , but where do the " Dutch " come from ?
In medieval times the Germanic people with whom the ordinary Englishman most frequently came into contact were sailors who lived on the other side of the North Sea .
They probably described themselves as " Deutsch " , which was later corrupted in English and written as " Dutch " .
In contrast , the " Germanic " people with whom the English aristocracy came into contact were the aristocracy of the Holy Roman Empire .
The mutual language of communication that they used was Latin , hence the area from which they came was described as " Germania " , which later became " Germany " .
To this day , notwithstanding the atrocities of 1940 - 45 , the Dutch national anthem has references to the country 's Germanic origin - the opening lines of the anthem ( written about 1569 ) being " Wilhelmus van Nassouwe / Ben ik van Duitsen bloed " which translates as : " I am William of Nassau / Of Germanic descent " .
Martin Vlietstra , Fleet , Hampshire
From the late Middle Ages to the 16th century , when linguistic distinctions were not sharply defined , the English often
described anyone , speaking a Germanic language as " Doch " or " T( h) eutonicus " , heedless of whether the subject hailed from Antwerp , Hamburg or Nuremberg .
A survey of aliens in London in 1568 found 5,225 " Dutch parsons " but only a meagre 22 " Garmans " .
Once the northern provinces of the Habsburg Low Countries gained their political independence in the early 17th century , it became usual to distinguish between Dutch and German speakers and their cultures .
" Dutch " derives from the Middle Dutch duuts or diets which ultimately stem from the old Germanic word theudo meaning " people " .
The nomenclature for the Low Countries has long puzzled foreigners , and no wonder .
In the early modern period there were perhaps eight different ways of referring to the region , its inhabitants and cultures .

Blood drawn with a simple needle stick can be coaxed into producing stem cells that may have the ability to form any type of tissue in the body , three independent papers report in the July 2 Cell Stem Cell .
The new technique will allow scientists to tap a large , readily available source of personalized stem cells .
Because taking blood is safe , fast and efficient compared to current stem cell harvesting methods , some of which include biopsies and pretreatments with drugs , researchers hope that blood - derived stem cells could one day be used to study and treat diseases – though major safety hurdles remain .
The findings “ represent a huge and important progression in the field , ” stem cell biologist Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University in Japan and the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease in San Francisco , writes in a commentary appearing in the same issue of the journal .
Three research groups used similar methods to prod certain immune cells in human blood to become induced pluripotent stem cells .
Because they are reprogrammed adult cells , these stem cells share many of the same regenerative abilities as true embryonic stem cells but may not have as much versatility in the kinds of mature cells they can become .
But induced pluripotent cells are harvested from adults and so do n’t face the same ethical mires posed by embryo - derived stem cells .
And as techniques for manipulating induced pluripotent cells improve , some researchers think they may be just as useful .
The new studies accomplished the reprogramming feat by using viruses to deliver a four - gene cocktail that reverts the cells to a naive state in which any developmental path is open .
In theory at least , these induced pluripotent stem cells could go on to form neurons in the brain , muscle cells in the leg or beating heart cells .
Scientists ’ manipulations turned the stem cells in the new studies into several types of mature blood cells , including infection - fighting T cells .
What ’s more , all the groups showed that a batch of the stem cells implanted into mice developed into the three main types of progenitor cells found in human embryos .
In embryos , these progenitor cells give rise to different tissues .
More research is needed to determine whether these cells can be further coaxed to form fully functional tissue , says Rudolf Jaenisch of MIT and the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge , Massachusetts , who led one of the studies .
The concern is that if these cells retain traces of memory from their previous lives as blood cells , they may not be good at forming other tissue types .
Past studies have induced other kinds of mature cells to form stem cells .
The most common source has been adult skin cells called fibroblasts , which have been manipulated into stem cells and then neurons ( SN : 2/27/10 , p. 5 ) .
But harvesting fibroblasts is harder than drawing blood , requiring surgery and sutures .
What ’s more , inducing fibroblasts to form stem cells can take about a month in the lab , during which mutations can accumulate .
The new blood cell techniques can be completed in a few days .
Stanford University stem cell biologist Marius Wernig points out that the new method is still less efficient than the fibroblast technique .
“ But with improving technology , this cell type could very well replace the skin fibroblasts currently mostly used to generate induced pluripotent stem cells from patients , ” Wernig says .
Researchers are still a long way off from transplanting such stem cells or their mature offspring into people safely .
The viruses used to deliver genes into the cells may have unintended consequences , and the cells ’ long - term behavior is still unknown .
But even if the cells wo n’t be put directly into patients , Jaenisch says that the new method “ opens up access to enormous resources of collected cells from patients ” that can be used to study diseases .
For example , lab experiments with cells from these collections might be used to study why motor neurons from people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis die , or how healthy liver cells respond to a promising but potentially toxic drug .

“ I think yes , but not on the same terms they offered us before , ” Finkelchtein told ProSport ( translated by Fighters Only ) of joining forces with the UFC .
“ We will not let ourselves to get owned .
Fedor became very popular [ already ] outside the Octagon .
So , long story short :
1 . We would like to receive guaranteed payments .
I know that if we agree for percents , they will cheat us .
2. Maybe not a co-promotion ( like we offered before ) , but at least co-branding .
3 . They also will have to permit Fedor participating in Sambo competitions , and during our last negotiations UFC were ready for that term . ”
Are you reading this , Mr. Dana White ???
For years , the primary sticking point between the two parties was M - 1 Global ’s undying insistence on sharing half the profits for all Fedor produced shows .
With their meal ticket ’s abrupt exile from the land of The Invincibles , the Russians now appear willing to play ball – as long as it ’s on their ( modified ) terms .
As far as who they would prefer Fedor to face in his next outing , Finkelchtein professed it was a no - brainer .
“ We are ready to fight against anyone , but everyone agrees that the most interesting fight right now is the rematch against Fabricio Werdum .
We have one fight left on our contract , so if Strikeforce wants to extend it , they should listen to our opinion , ” Finkelstein said .
“ Fedor will fight again sometime between October and November … the only thing fans want to see is Fedor vs. Werdum II .
Fabricio himself said that he would like to rematch Fedor . ”
The reason is clear why M - 1 Global is pushing for an immediate mulligan .
Werdum not only snapped Emelianenko ’s 27 - fight win streak last month , but quickly dispelled his unparalleled aura of invincibility as well .
The best way to recapture that mojo is by violently rectifying the “ fluke ” defeat – ala what Georges St - Pierre did to Matt Serra in their UFC 83 rematch .
Still no official word on when and where Fedor will finalize his commitment to the San Jose , California based promotion .
Newspapers are slowly dying off because the cost to distribute content via newsprint — something that used to be the industry ’s biggest competitive advantage — is now a massive disadvantage .
But the editorial cycle , where writers and editors are vetted and hired ; articles are vetted and edited by these pre-screened talents ; etc .
The goal is to maintain a high level of quality and accuracy .
This comes at the expense of speed , as additional checks and approvals inherently require additional time .
Note that in the pre-digital world , this did n’t matter , because publications were only able to publish once a day anyway — they , quite literally , had all day to write , edit , and fact check articles .
But the alleged benefits — again , quality and accuracy — are supposed to be the point of differentiation between newspapers and newer media , e.g. blogs and tweets and email blasts and the like .
So when the New York Post publishes a column by Filip Bondy bemoaning how Major League Baseball veterans are relegated to the undignified designated hitter role , one expects the argument to be a home run .
Instead , we get classless claptrap .
Witness :
The DH may forever represent an unwanted demotion for older sluggers – [ Hideki ] Matsui , too , felt that way – but it is the fate of almost everyone , if they ’re good enough to hang around .
Thurman Munson was spared this indignity , in tragic fashion , dying at age 32 .
In other words : “ It ’s a good thing Thurman Munson died in a plane crash , or he would have become a designated hitter !
How awful ! ”
If this made it past the controls at a newspaper , where ’s the value in the process ?
Scareware has become such an indomitable economic force that the take down of perhaps the largest , most vertically - integrated scareware purveyor , Innovative Marketing , has had a negligible deterrent effect .
Innovative Marketing operated from 2004 through mid-2008 .
Court records show that Innovative Marketing fooled computer users into paying for fake antivirus programs worth at least $ 163,167,539.95 .
That ’s the amount the Federal Trade Commission documented as having been bank - depositedÃ‚Â by this criminal enterprise .
Last month , the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Bjorn Daniel Sundin , 31 , a U.S. citizen believed to be living in the Ukraine , Shaileshkumar P. Jain , 40 , of Sweden , and James Reno , 26 , of Amelia , Ohio , named as Innovative Marketing ’s top executives .
Reno is described in court records as the technical genius behind the operation , Sundin as the CEO and Jain as the COO .
The USDOJ is specifically going after a $ 100 million chunk of that cash believed to be sitting in a bank in Kiev , Ukraine .
Sustainable business model
So what has happened as the noose has tightened around this gang ’s collective necks ?
Online promotions for scareware has actually increased 10 fold in the first three months of this year as compared to mid-2008 when U.S. regulators dismantled the firm , says McAfee researcher Francois Paget .
Panda Security reports similar findings .
In 2008 , PandaLabs identified a total of 92,215 scareware samples .
In the first quarter of of 2009 that number soared to 111,086 — more samples in three months than in the previous 12 months put together .
In the second quarter of 2009 PandaLabs identified 374,204 .
Underscoring the continued steady rise of scareware , Microsoft ’s free Malicious Software Removal Tool cleaned scareware off 7.8 million PCs in the second half of 2009 , up from 5.3 million computers in the first six months of last year .
“ Scareware continues to flourish because itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a highly profitable and sustainable business model , ” says Sean - Paul Correll , researcher at Panda Security .
“ Innovative Marketing is the only company to be taken down and it obviously has nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t stopped the threat yet . ”
The roots of this booming cybercriminal industry can be traced back to 2005 and the escapades of Andrej Sporaw and iframeCASH.biz .
Sporaw developed a system for recruiting “ affiliates ” to infect webpages to serve up pop -up ads for which they got paid .
Vertical - integrated scare campaigns
Fast forward half a decade : Ukraine - based Innovative Marketing employed hundreds of employees collaborating as part of a multi-faceted , vertically - integrated operation to scare hundreds of thousands of victims into paying $ 30 to $ 70 for such software , according to court records .
Innovative Marketing created dummy ad agencies to place innocuous - looking ads for corporate entities like Major League Baseball , Priceline , Career Builder , the National Association of Realtors and E - Harmony .
The scammers actually had no affiliations with , nor permission from , the corporations to do this .
Clicking on such an ad triggered a fake scan showing the PC to be infested with viruses .
A pitch followed to buy a bogus clean - up and worthless antivirus protection .
Variations of this ruse continue to infest the Internet orchestrated by “ new , more discreet entities , ” says McAfee researcher Paget .
Current scareware scams revolve around :
– Blackmail .
Some scareware , referred to as “ ransomware , ” will lock out access to the victim ’s computer until the victim pays $ 70 for a “ license key ” to regain access .
“ The majority of rogues we see today essentially blackmail the computer user by disabling key Windows features , such as the registry editor or the command line — tools that could permit a savvy user to remove the rogue antivirus him - or herself , ” says Webroot researcher James Reid .
Some scareware proactively disables certain program features inÃ‚Â popular browser , messaging and even antiviurs programs designed to block malicious programs .
“ Essentially , the computer is being held hostage by the rogue , ” says Reid .
– Search results .
Tainted webpages are crafted to turn up high in the search results rankings for Google queries about celebrities and big news events .
Clicking on the tainted link triggers the fake scan and promotion .
“ This is black hat SEO — essentially , the criminals obtain stolen Web site credentials , then use those passwords to upload Web pages which display one set of information — usually it ’s a page full of ‘ hot ’ keywordsto search engine spiders / web crawlers , ie , the Google bot , and exhibit completely different behavior , ” says Webroot researcher Andrew Brandt
Usually , javascript gets launched which begins the whole “ fakealert ” behavior described as Brandt describes here .
– Social networks .
High trust and rapid bursts of communications in Facebook and Twitter make social networks ideal for getting members to click on tainted weblinks that trigger scareware .
“ Quite simply , the scareware industry is booming , ” says Roel Schouwenberg , senior researcher at Kasperky Lab .
Consumers tend to trust authoritative messages , as well as messages perceived to be from social network friends .
Ã‚Â Criminals can easily manipulate Twitter and Facebook accounts to spread tainted links that triggger scareware promos to unwitting users .
“ Legitimate antivirus suites have had a hard time blocking these things effectively , ” says Schouenberg .
“ Unless there are some big arrests – or fear for arrests – I do n’t see the situation changing . ”
Tighter merchant banking controls needed
While criminal cleverness and consumer gullibility are two major drivers , the fact remains that Innovative Marketing managed to obtain approval forÃ‚Â at least $ 163 million worth of credit card transactions , at $ 30 to 70 a pop .
This suggests that scareware purveyors are taking full advantage of global merchant banking system that ’s loosely policed , when it comes to online transactions .
Says Brandt : “ If the world can demand that Swiss banks reveal the names of customers living in countries other than Switzerland who might be violating tax laws in their home countries , then the world should also be able to demand that ISPs , payment processors , and the whole network of services and businesses that support the scareware industry be held to account for the damage they share responsibility for perpetuating . ”

With that “ metal ” casing it ’s really shaping into a device that has that original Droid 1 feel sans keyboard .
The last thing we needed was another plastic Incredible which lasts all of one pocket drop .
Stay tuned for more details …
Massachusetts federal judge Nancy Gertner just slashed the damage award against admitted P2P user Joel Tenenbaum from $ 675,000 to $ 67,500 .
In her opinion , she drew a fascinating parallel between Tenenbaum 's conduct and that of bars and restaurants who do n't pay up for a license to play music in public .
Why are n't they hit with tremendous six - figure fines ?
" The jury 's award in this case also appears egregious in light of the damages typically imposed on restaurants , bars , and other businesses that play copyrighted songs in their establishments without first acquiring the appropriate licenses , " Gertner wrote .
" These defendants are arguably more culpable than Tenenbaum .
Unlike Tenenbaum , who did not receive any direct pecuniary gain from his file - sharing , defendants in these cases play copyrighted music to create a more pleasurable atmosphere for their customers , thus generating more business and , consequently , more revenue . "
Yet , in such cases , damage awards are only 2 - 6 x the cost of a public performance license , " a ratio of statutory to actual damages far lower than the ratio present in this case . "
Gertner cites numerous cases where restaurants failed to pay up , used the music for commercial gain , and were then hauled to court .
The Spring Mount Area Bavarian Resort in Pennsylvania , for instance , was sued over its lack of a performance license back in 2008 .
The cost of license would have been $ 3,725 ; when the resort was found liable , it had to pay damages of $ 6,750 .
Other awards in similar cases include $ 30,000 , $ 34,500 , and $ 16,000 judgments .
By contrast , juries decided that sharing 30 songs on the ' Net ( with no pecuniary motivation ) was worth $ 675,000 and that sharing 24 songs might be worth anywhere from $ 220,000 to $ 1.9 million ( the two Jammie Thomas - Rasset trials in Minnesota ) .
It did n't help that both defendants lied ( and both judges called them out for it in post - trial rulings ) , but still — the sheer variability of these verdicts for basically similar cases show that juries are plucking numbers from a hat here .
When real businesses commit similar offenses , lawyers do n't show up to court and utter apocalyptic rhetoric about how unlicensed bar tunes are " killing the music business . "
And the results are n't designed to bankrupt the establishment in question .
Gertner can't understand the shocking difference in outcomes .
" I cannot conceive of any plausible rationale for the discrepancy between the level of damages imposed in public - performance cases and the damages awarded in this case , " she wrote .
" The disparity strongly suggests that the jury ’s $ 675,000 award is arbitrary and grossly excessive . "

Moss is lifted from his Lotus after his career - ending crash © Getty Images Enlarge
Sir Stirling Moss's Formula
One career ended on the 23rd April 1962 , when he crashed head - on into a grass verge during a non-championship race at Goodwood .
Photos taken immediately after show the severity of the 110 mph impact and his recovery from a lengthily coma was covered in detail by the press .
However , the lesser known side of the story is how Moss dealt with his recovery personally and what exactly happened to his brain that meant he could no longer drive a racing car on the limit .
Matters of the mind are never simple , but in a revealing new documentary set to air on BBC Four on Sunday at 9.00 pm , Richard Hammond - himself the victim of a life - changing crash while filming for Top Gear - interviews
Moss about how he dealt with losing , what was essentially , his livelihood .
Hammond meets
Moss starts by reviewing Moss 's career , with Hammond firmly in control of the questions and Moss answering with all his trademark charm and wit .
But as the subject topic turns to the crash and its aftermath , the interviewer / interviewee relationship is thrown out of the window as the pair engage in an open conversation about their accidents .
This is entirely to the programme 's benefit and allows Hammond to probe deeper into Moss 's recovery than perhaps any other presenter could .
Moss is frank and forthright - as he often is in his columns for ESPNF1 - while Hammond reveals the astounding extent of his post - traumatic amnesia .
For those familiar with Moss 's career the programme is an absolute must , but it will also appeal to anybody with even a passing interest in the workings of the mind .

In a 1995 attempt to encourage more exploration , Congress agreed to reduce the cut of the proceeds the government could collect on oil and gas drilling in deep waters .
Ten years later , despite higher oil prices and declarations from President George W. Bush that more incentives were not needed , a Republican - led Congress reduced royalties yet again .
And in a sign of how money had influenced and distorted the debate , throughout the last decade the Louisiana Congressional delegation , for a time including the state ’s current governor , Bobby Jindal , backed expanded offshore drilling so that Congress could use proceeds to pay for coastal damage caused by oil - and - gas operations .
In 2006 the delegation supported legislation giving a share of federal royalties to states that allowed drilling in federal waters off their coasts , essentially using national revenue to encourage more exploration .
At the same time that Congress called for new drilling incentives , it also gutted oversight .
From 2002 to 2008 , legislators approved budgets reducing regulatory staffing levels by more than 15 percent  despite more complex deep - water operations and Interior Department concerns , voiced in 2000 , that industry ’s extensive use of contractors and inexperienced offshore workers posed new risks in deep water .
It ’s not as if Congress did n’t know the risks .
Its own research arm , which issues frequent spill - response readiness assessments , has repeatedly cited a 2004 Coast Guard study finding that its “ oil spill response personnel did not appear to have even a basic knowledge of the equipment required to support salvage or spill clean - up operations . ”
Nevertheless , lawmakers failed to act aggressively to ensure adequate oversight .
To be fair , Congress was n’t alone .
The same criticism could be leveled at many environmental groups , which were far more interested in maintaining the exploration moratoriums in federal waters than in the safety of ongoing offshore activity .
This focus on stopping new drilling  instead of on keeping the water clean  helped give Interior the space to cater to oil companies .
As a result , regulatory proposals often received fewer than 10 public comments , mostly from industry , resulting in rules more favorable to it .

When chairman Jonney Shih unveiled the Asus Eee Pad on stage at Computex today , the crowd of journalists almost rushed the stage with excitement .
Unlike the similarly - named Asus Eee Tablet , which is designed to compete with e-Readers like the Nook and the Kindle , the Eee Pad is designed to go head - to - head with the Apple iPad .
The Eee Pad is a Windows 7 - based device that uses an Intel CULV Core 2 Duo processor and a touch - sensitive capacitive screen .
It can be used as a multimedia player , e-reader , Web - browser , or , with the help of a keyboard docking station , full - featured PC .
Asus will be releasing two versions of the Eee Pad .
The EP101TC will come with a 10 - inch screen and the EP121 will ship with a 12 - inch screen .
Asus claims both systems will deliver at least 10 hours of battery life .
Asus chairman Jonney
Shih says that tablet devices like this will bridge the conventional divide between business and consumer products .
" We envision a different kind of usage scenario , " Shih said .
" You can be both a premier professional and a housewife . "
Question is , can Asus get an Eee Pad in her hands before she buys an iPad .
No specific ship date was given .

The incredible pictures from the edge of space - taken with a £ 30 digital camera attached to a balloon
They look like pictures taken from the International Space Station .
Or at least from an expensive satellite launched by a major superpower .
But amateur astro- snapper Colin Rich got these incredible space pictures by flying his very own £ 30 camera to the edge of space - taped to a balloon .
While NASA spends hundreds of millions of pounds each year on their high tech satellites , the 27 - year - old managed to capture views of our planet from an amazing 125,000 feet ( 24 miles ) up on a digital camera purchased on Ebay .
Freelance cinematographer Colin encased a five - year - old digital camera in Styrofoam casing wrapped in duct - tape and floated it up into the planet 's stratosphere on a weather balloon .
One of the incredible photographs capturing the sun glinting behind the earth taken at 125,000 feet over the Californian Pacific coast
The picture was taken with a five year old digital camera in styrofoam casing sent into the heavens on a balloon
His crude device still travelled nearly four times higher than the cruising altitude of a jumbo jet .
Named Pacific Star 2 , the project was the pair 's second attempt at photographing earth from the edge of space and comes only four months after they began planning .
Inspired by British photographer Robert Harrison , whose pictures of earth taken from 116,000 feet stunned NASA in October 2008 , Mr Rich decided he could go one better and flew his home - made contraption 9,000 feet ( two miles ) higher .
' We launched on June 5 from a field in Oxnard , in California , ' said Colin , who works for companies like Nickelodeon in Los Angeles .
' We took our helium tank down there and inflated the latex weather balloon to three feet in diameter and then in the late afternoon we launched . '
A patchwork of farmland as Pacific Star 2 rises above California
Carrying a Canon Powershot A560 that he bought online , the digital camera was encased inside a Styrofoam rectangle tied up with duct - tape .
' It was very amateur but of course that is half the fun , ' he said .
He has been launching weather balloons into the upper atmosphere since March .
He added : ' The Styrofoam casing protected the camera from the cold and enabled it to carry on shooting video and taking pictures on the timer I had programmed
' Rising at a steady rate of around 17 knots per minute , the balloon took around one and a half hours to reach the stratosphere - the area where the Earth 's atmosphere stops and space begins .
' By the time the balloon reached 125,000 feet it had expanded by over seven times to around 24 feet .
' Then it would have burst , the parachute would have deployed and then of course we would go and recover the Styrofoam casing . '
The casing that contains the Canon Powershot A560 camera which took these remarkable pictures
Landing 20 miles from the launch site , the Pacific Star 's flight time was a little over two and a half hours and cost only £ 500 in total .
' We tracked the balloon using a GPS device similar to satellite navigation you use in your car called ' The Spot ' , ' said Colin .
' Me and my colleague William were delighted with the results .

Introduction
IPTables has always been a relatively flexible and modular firewall ; if it can't currently test for a particular packet characteristic , you have the option of writing a test or modifying an existing test .
The catch - as with so much of open source - is that most of us are n't programmers .
It turns out we do have an option that does n't require programming .
Don Cohen was kind enough to write an IPTables module that pulls any bytes you 'd like out of the packet , does some manipulation , and sees if the result is in a particular range .
For example , I can grab the Fragmentation information out of the IP header , throw away everything except the More Fragments flag , and see if that flag is set .
Without writing any C code at all . :-)
What I 'll do is introduce the core concepts here , and put in hopefully enough annotated examples that you 'll be able to write your own tests .
I wo n't be focusing on what these fields are , or why you 'd want to test them ; there are lots of ( warning - shameless plug for my employer ahead ! ) resources for doing that .
If you simply need a quick reference for the packet headers , see tcpip.pdf .
All byte positions in this article start counting at 0 as the first byte of the header .
For example , in the IP header , byte " 0 " holds the 4 bit " Version " and 4 bit " IP Header Length " , byte " 1 " holds the " TOS " field , etc .
Check the value of a 2 byte field
In it 's simplest form , u32 grabs a block of 4 bytes starting at Start , applies a mask of Mask to it , and compares the result to Range .
Here 's the syntax we 'll use for our first examples :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " Start& Mask=Range "
We 'll generally pick a " Start " value that 's 3 less than the last byte in which you 're interested .
So , if you want bytes 4 and 5 of the IP header ( the IP ID field ) , Start needs to be 5 - 3 = 2 .
Mask strips out all the stuff you do n't want ; it 's a bitmask that can be as large as 0xFFFFFFFF .
To get to our target of bytes 4 or 5 , we have to discard bytes 2 and 3 .
Here 's the mask we 'll use : 0x0000 FFFF .
We 'll actually use the shorter , and equivalent , 0xFFFF instead .
So , to test for IPID 's from 2 to 256 , the iptables command line is :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 2&0x FFFF=0x2:0x0100 "
To read this off from left to right : " Load the u32 module , and perform the following u32 tests on this packet ; grab the 4 bytes starting with byte 2 ( bytes 2 and 3 are the Total Length field , and bytes 4 and 5 are the IPID ) , apply a mask of 0x0000 FFFF ( which sets the first two bytes to all zeroes , leaving the last two bytes untouched ) , and see if that value - the IPID - falls between 2 and 256 inclusive ; if so , return true , otherwise false . "
There is no standalone IPID check in IPTables , but this is the equivalent of the " ip [ 2:2 ] >= 2 and ip [ 2:2 ] <= 256 " tcpdump / bpf filter .
I leave off actions in these examples , but you can add things like :
-j LOG -- log- prefix " ID - in-2-256 "
-j DROP
or any other action .
You can also add other tests , as we 'll do in a minute .
Don offers this test to see if the total packet length is greater than or equal to 256 .
The total length field is bytes 2 and 3 of the IP header , so our starting position is 3 - 3 =
0 .
Since we 're pulling out two bytes again , the mask will be 0xFFFF here as well .
The final test is :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 0&0xFFFF=0x100:0xFFF
F "
This is the same as :
iptables -m length -- length 256:65535
or the bpf filter
" len >= 256 "
Check the value of a 1 byte field
Much the same , except we 'll use a mask of 0x000000 FF ( or it 's shorter equivalent 0xFF ) to pull out a single byte from the 4 bytes u32 initially hands us .
Let 's say I want to test the TTL field for TTL 's below 3 to find people tracerouting to us .
Yes , there 's a ttl module , but let 's see how this would be done in u32 .
I want to end up with byte 8 of the IP header , so my starting position is 8 - 3 =
5 .
Here 's the test :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 5&0x FF=0:3 "
Which is equivalent to :
iptables -m ttl -- ttl-lt 4
or the bpf filter
" ip [ 8 ] <= 3 "
Looking at 4 bytes at once
To check a complete destination IP address , we 'll inspect bytes 16 - 19 .
Because we want all 4 bytes , we do n't need a mask at all .
Let 's see if the destination address is 224.0.0.1 :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 16=0xE0000001 "
This is equivalent to :
iptables -d 224.0.0.1/32
If we only want to look at the first three bytes ( to check if a source address is part of a given class C network ) , we 'll need to use a mask again .
The mask we 'll use is 0xFFFFFF00 , which throws away the last octet .
Let 's check if the source address ( from bytes 12 - 15 , although we 'll ignore byte 15 with the mask ) is in the class C network 192.168.15.0 ( 0xC0A80F00 ) :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 12&0xFFFFFF00=0xC0A80F00 "
Which is the same as :
iptables -s 192.168.15.0/24
Inspecting early bytes in the header
Obviously , if I want to look at the TOS field ( byte 1 of the IP header ) , I can't start at byte 1 - 3 = - 2 .
What we 'll do instead is start at byte 0 , pull out the byte we want , and then move it down to the last position for easy testing .
This is n't the only way we could do this , but it helps demonstrate a technique we 'll need in a minute .
To pull out the TOS field , I first ask u32 to give me bytes 0 - 3 by using an offset of 0 .
Now , I pull out byte 1 ( the second byte in that block ) with a mask of 0x00FF0000 .
I need to shift the TOS value down to the far right position for easy comparison .
To do this , I use a technique called , unsuprisingly , " right shift " .
The symbol for right shift is " > > " ; this is followed by the number of bits right to move the data .
If you 're unfamiliar with right shift , take a look at this tutorial from Harper College .
I want to move TOS two bytes - or 16 bits - to the right .
This is done with " >> 16 " .
Now that we have TOS in the correct position , we compare it to 0x08 ( Maximize Throughput ) :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 0&0x00FF0000 >> 16=0x08 "
which is the equivalent of :
iptables -m ttl -- tos 8
Inspecting individual bits
I 'd like to look at the " More Fragments " flag - a flag which has no existing test in iptables ( - f matches 2nd and further fragments , I want to match all fragments except the last ) .
Byte 6 contains this , so I 'll start with offset 3 and throw away bytes 3 - 5 .
Normally this would use a mask of 0x000000 FF , but I also want to discard the other bits in that last byte .
The only bit I want to keep is the third from the top ( 0010 0000 ) , so the mask I 'll use is 0x00000020 .
Now I have two choices ; move that bit down to the lowest position and compare , or leave it in its current position and compare .
To move it down , we 'll right shift 5 bits .
The final test is :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 3&0x20 >>5=1 "
If I take the other approach of leaving the bit where it is , I need to be careful about the compare value on the right .
If that bit is turned on , the compare value needs to be 0x20 as well .
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 3&0x20=0x20 "
Both approaches return true if the More Fragments flag is turned on .
Combining tests
If you want to inspect more than one aspect of a packet , use :
&&
between each test .
Moving on to the TCP header
This is a little tricky .
Let 's say I 'd like to look at bytes 4 - 7 of the TCP header ( the TCP sequence number ) .
Let 's take the simple approach first , and then look at some ways to improve this .
For our first version , let 's assume that the IP header is 20 bytes long - usually a good guess .
Our starting point is byte 4 of the tcp header that immediately follows the IP header .
Our simplistic test for whether the sequence number is 41 ( hex 29 ) might look like this :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 24=0x29 "
For packets where the IP header length is 20 , this will actually work , but there are a few problems .
Let 's fix them one by one .
First , we never check to see if the packet is even a TCP packet .
This is stored in byte 9 of the IP header , so we 'll pull 4 bytes starting at byte 6 , drop 6 - 8 , and check to see if it 's 6 .
The new rule that first checks if this is a TCP packet at all and also checks that the Sequence Number is 41 is :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 6&0x FF=0x6 && 24=0x29 "
The second problem we 've momentarily ignored is the IP header length .
True , it usually is 20 bytes long , but it can be longer , if IP options are used .
Here are the steps .
We pull the IP header length ( a nibble that shows how many 4 bytes words there are in the header , usually 5 ) out of the IP header .
We multiply it by 4 to get the number of bytes in the IP header .
We use this number to say how many bytes to jump to get to the beginning of the TCP header , and jump 4 more bytes to get to the Sequence number .
To get the header length , we need the first byte : " 0 > > 24 " , but we need to only grab the lower nibble and we need to multiply that number by 4 to get the actual number of bytes in the header .
To do the multiply , we 'll right shift 22 instead of 24 .
With this shift , we 'll need to use a mask of 0x3C instead of the 0x0 F we would have used .
The expression so far is : " 0>>22&0x3 C " .
On an IP header with no options , that expression returns 20 ; just what we 'd expect .
Now we need to tell u32 to use that number and make a jump that many bytes into the packet , a step performed by the " @ " operator .
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 6&0x FF=0x6 && 0>>22&0x3C@4=0x29 "
The " @ " grabs the number we created on its left ( 20 , normally ) and jumps that many bytes forward ( we can even do this more than once - see the TCP payload section below ) .
The 4 to its right tells u32 to grab bytes 4 - 7 , but u32 knows to pull them relative to the 20 bytes it skipped over .
This gives us the Sequence Number , even if the IP header grows because of options .
* phew *!
The last quirk to handle is fragments .
When we were only working with the IP header , this was n't an issue ; IP is designed in such a way that the IP header itself can never be fragmented .
The TCP header and application payload technically might be , and if we 're handed the second or further fragment , we might be looking not at the Sequence Number in bytes 4 - 7 , but perhaps some other part of the TCP header , or more likely , some application layer data .
What we 'll do is check that this is the first fragment ( or an unfragmented packet , the test wo n't care ) , so that we 're sure we 're looking at tcp header info .
To do this , we test the fragment offset in most ( we discard the top three flag bits ) of bytes 6 and 7 of the IP header to make sure the offset is 0 .
The test is : " 4&0x1FFF=0 "
The final expression ( check for TCP , check for unfragmented packet or first fragment , and jump over the IP header , checking that bytes 4 - 7 of the TCP header are equal to 41 ) is :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 6&0x FF=0x6 && 4&0x1 FFF=0 && 0>>22&0x3C@4=0x29 "
If the packet is , in fact , fragmented , we have one more consideration ; the fragment might be so small that the field we 're testing might have been put in a future fragment !
In this one case , it 's not an issue because every IP link should handle packets of at least 68 bytes ; even if the IP header was at its maximum of 60 bytes , the first 8 bytes of the TCP header should be included in that first fragment .
When we start testing for things further in to the packet , we 'll have to depend on u32's ability to simply return false if we ever try to ask for a value that falls outside of the packet being inspected .
Checking for values in the ICMP header
Let 's look for ICMP Host Unreachables ( ICMP , type 3 , code 1 ) .
Just as in the above example , we need to check for the Protocol field ( Protocol 1 = ICMP this time ) and that we 're looking at a complete packet or at least the first fragment : " 6&0x FF=1 && 4&0x1FFF=0 "
To check for the ICMP Type and Code , we skip over the IP header again ( " 0>>22&0x3 C@ ... " ) .
To grab the first two bytes , we 'll start at offset 0 and just right shift 16 bits .
The final test is :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 6&0xFF=1 && 4&0x1 FFF=0 && 0>>22&0x3C@0>>16=0x0301 "
Checking for values in the UDP payload
Lets try going all the way into the packet payload now , and match packets that are UDP DNS queries .
Here we 're not only going to check for destination port 53 , but we 're also going to test the top bit of byte 2 of the payload ; if set , this is a DNS query .
We start by checking that this is a UDP packet : " 6&0 x FF =17 " .
We add the now familiar check for first fragment : " 4&0x1 FFF=0 " .
To test the destination port , we grab bytes 2 and 3 from the udp header ( after jumping over the IP header as in the previous examples ) : " 0>>22&0x3C@0&0xFFFF=53 " .
If the packet has passed all of the above , we go back to check the payload ( remember we have to jump over the variable - length IP and 8 byte UDP headers " 0>>22&0x3C@8 ... " ) to make sure this is a DNS query rather than a response .
To grab the high bit from byte 2 , I 'll use offset 8 to grab the first 4 payload bytes , right shift 15 bits to deposit the Query bit in the lowest position , and throw away all the rest of the bits with a mask of 0x01 : " 0>>22&0x3C@8 >> 15&0x01=1 "
The final test is :
iptables -m u32 --u32 " 6&0x FF=17 && 4&0x1 FFF=0 && 0>>22&0x3C@0&0xFFFF=53 && 0>>22&0x3C@8>>15&0x01=1 "
Ugh .
I 've seen stellar noise that had less entropy :-)
Note that we 're doing the whole thing with u32 checks ; we could pull out the " udp " , " first / no fragment " and " port 53 " checks into other modules , and end up with this slightly more readable version :
iptables -p udp -- dport 53 \! -f -m u32 --u32 " 0>>22&0x3C@8>>15&0x01=1 "
Checking for values in the TCP payload
As with the udp payload example above , this approach is only useful if we 're absolutely certain of where our data of interest can be found .
In this example , I want to find ssh sessions , even if they 're on a port _other_ than 22 .
But wait - ssh connections are encrypted !
Sounds hopeless ?
Actually , it is n't .
The first thing to happen in an ssh connection is that the server sends a protocol string back to the client .
The protocol looks like : SSH - protoversion - softwareversion comments
The protoversion is generally 1.99 , 2.0 , or 1.5 .
The entire line , including a possible trailing carriage return and linefeed , needs to be smaller than 255 bytes .
This line _may_ have another line before it , but this would break compatibility with ssh 1.0 clients , so I 'm guessing this is uncommon .
The above information comes from draft - ietf - secsh - transport - 17.txt , if you want to see more details .
The interesting piece , as far as we 're concerned , is that " SSH - " string .
It lands in the first 4 bytes of the connection .
Bingo !
We can use the u32 module to look at only those bytes in the early part of a connection ; this is a much less intensive check than checking with the string module , and makes it feasible to look for ssh connections on any port without undue load on the firewall .
Lets get the easy stuff out of the way .
I want to check tcp packets , unfragmented ones , I 'm only interested in packets in the first 255 bytes of a connection , and established ones , obviously , and the entire packet length needs to be between 45 and 375 bytes ( think about the minimums and maximums for IP and tcp headers and ssh protocol string ) :
iptables -p tcp \! -f -m connbytes -- connbytes 0:255 -m state -- state ESTABLISHED
-m length -- length 46:375
With these restrictions , we should be inspecting very few packets ; this allows us to look at the first few packets of every connection for legitimate or rogue ssh connections .
Now u32 does its magic .
We 'll build it up from scratch .
Because we 've already checked for protocol TCP , we 'll skip 6&0x FF=0x6 .
We skip over the IP header with 0>> 22&0x3C@ :
0>>22&0x3C@
We now need to skip over the tcp header ; we pull the TCP header length from the first half of byte 12 .
Although we'd need to right shift it 28 bits to get it into the last 4 bits of our 32 bit buffer , we have to multiply this by 4 , too , to get the number of 4 - byte words this number expresses ; this is why we right shift by 26 and mask again with 0x3C :
0>>22&0x3C@ 12>>26&0x3C@
This slides us into the tcp payload portion of the packet .
As the bytes we want to test should generally be in the first 4 bytes of the packet , we just grab 4 bytes starting at 0 and compare them to 0x5353482D ( the hex equivalent of " SSH - " ) :
0>>22&0x3C@ 12>>26&0x3 C@ 0=0x5353482D
Here 's the entire test , line wrapped to save screen space :
iptables -p tcp \! -f -m connbytes -- connbytes 0:255 -m state -- state ESTABLISHED
-m length -- length 46:375 - m u32 --u32 " 0>>22&0x3C@ 12>>26&0x3 C@ 0=0x5353482 D "
Once I 've done this , I can even check for specific SSH protocol versions with -m string -- string " SSH - 1.99 " or even as specific as -m string -- string " SSH - 1.99 - OpenSSH_3.7.1p2 " .
This string match - normally very expensive in terms of processor time per packet - is n't bad at all if we 've already figured out with the previous iptables command that this is almost certainly an ssh protocol string .
By essentially requiring " SSH - " in the first 4 bytes of the connection , we avoid the problem of the string match incorrectly matching " SSH - " when someone downloads this article over port 80 .
Wrapup
With homage to Douglas Adams , Do n't Panic .
The examples we 've worked through have been annoyingly complex .
The nice part ?
You do n't have to rewrite them every time you want to inspect something else in the icmp header , or tcp payload , or anything else .
Just grab the appropriate tests from above - or the table below - and finish them off with the specific field you wanted to inspect .
Tests
First , a recap of the above , then some additional tests .
" 2&0x FFFF=0x2:0x0100 "
Test for IPID 's between 2 and 256 " 0&0x FFFF=0x100:0xFFFF "
Check for packets with 256 or more bytes .
" 5&0 x FF=0:3 " Match packets with a TTL of 3 or less .
" 16=0xE0000001 " Destination IP address is 224.0.0.1 " 12&0xFFFFFF00=0xC0A80F00 " Source IP is in the 192.168.15 .X class C network .
0&0x00FF0000 >>16=0x08
Is the TOS field 8 ( Maximize Throughput ) ?
" 3&0x20 > > 5=1 "
Is the More Fragments flag set ?
" 6&0x FF=0x6 " Is the packet a TCP packet ?
" 4&0x1 FFF=0 " Is the fragment offset 0 ?
( If so , this is either an unfragmented packet or the first fragment ) .
" 0>>22&0x3C@4=0x29 "
Is the TCP Sequence number 41 ?
( This requires the previous two checks for TCP and First Fragment as well ) " 0>>22&0x3C@0 >>16=0x0301 "
Check for ICMP type=3 and code=1 ( needs UDP and first fragment tests too )
" 0>>22&0x3C@0&0xFFFF=53 "
Is the UDP destination port 53 ?
( Check for udp and first / no fragment first ) " 0>>22&0x3C@8>> 15&0x01=1 "
Check that the UDP DNS Query bit is set ( again , check for UDP , first / no fragment , and dest port 53 first ) .
" 0>>22&0x3C@ 12>>26&0x3 C@ 0=0x5353482D "
Are the first 4 bytes of the TCP payload " SSH - " ?
( this requires a number of additional checks ; the entire line is : iptables - p tcp \! -f -m connbytes -- connbytes 0:255 -m state -- state ESTABLISHED
-m length -- length 46:375 - m u32 --u32 " 0>>22&0x3C@ 12>>26&0x3 C@ 0=0x5353482D "
And now , some new tests : " 6&0xFF=1 " Is this an ICMP packet ?
( From Don Cohen 's documentation ) " 6&0x FF =17 " Is this a UDP packet ?
" 4&0x3 FFF=0 "
Is the fragment offset 0 and MF cleared ?
( If so , this is an unfragmented packet ) .
" 4&0x3 FFF=1:0x3 FFF "
Is the fragment offset greater than 0 or MF set ?
( If so , this is a fragment ) .
0>>22&0x3C@12>>26&0x3 C@-3&0xFF=0:255
Is there any payload on this tcp packet ( check for tcp and not fragmented first ) ?
This elegant test was contributed by Don Cohen as I fumbled for a way to look for payload on a syn packet .
By simply testing to see if payload byte 0 has a value between 0 and 255 , we get true if payload byte 0 exists ( read : " if there is any payload at all " ) , and false if we 've gone beyond the end of the packet ( read : " if there is no payload " ) .
" 0>>22&0x3C@8=3000 "
Is the TCP ack field 3000 ?
( This , too , needs the TCP and First fragment checks )
" 0>>22&0x3C@10&0x80=0x80 "
Is the high order bit ( CWR ) of the TCP flag byte ( 13 ) turned on ?
( Needs TCP and first fragment checks too ) .
To see if it 's off , use =0 at the end instead of =0x80 .
" 0>>22&0x3C@10&0x40=0x40 "
Is the next bit down ( ECN - Echo ) turned on ?
Likewise , =0 to see if it 's off .
" 3&0xE0=0x20 "
Is the More Fragments bit set , and are the Reserved and Don't fragment flags cleared ?
" 3&0x20=0x20 "
This also checks if MF is set , but does n't care about Reserved or Do n't fragment .
" 3&0xE0=0x60 "
Are More Fragments and Don't fragment set , and is Reserved cleared ?
" 3&0xE0=0x80 "
Is reserved set , and are More Fragments and Don't fragment cleared ?
" 0>>22&0x3C@2&0xFFFF=0 "
Is the ICMP ID ( inside an echo request or reply packet ) 0 ?
This assumes you 've already checked that the packet is icmp , unfragmented , and an echo request or reply .
" 0>>22&0x3C@4&0xFFFF=35 "
Is the ICMP echo Sequence number 35 ?

The funny thing about Elon Musk is that he does sort of remind you of Tony Stark .
Minus the Iron Man suit .
Like the fictional Mr. Stark , Mr. Musk seems like the kind of guy every Silicon Valley hopeful wants to be .
For starters , he ’s a rocket scientist .
No , really : he helped design the Falcon 9 booster used by NASA .
He also helped create Solar City , a leader in solar power .
And he helped dream up the Tesla , the electric car that made electric cars sexy .
No wonder the film director Jon Favreau modeled his über - capitalist superhero on Mr. Musk .
There is just one small problem : Mr. Musk says he is broke .
Come again ?
Mr. Musk is a member of the PayPal Mafia  those serial entrepreneurs who , for a time , looked like the Brat Pack of the Valley .
He made a fortune as a co-founder of PayPal , the e-commerce payments system .
Not so long ago , he had more than $ 200 million in cash .
Not bad for 38 .
Now Mr. Musk , who is in the middle of a divorce , says his account is empty .
Actually , less than empty .
He says he invested his last cent in his businesses and is living off loans from his wealthy friends .
He subsists , according to court filings , on $ 200,000 a month and still flies his private jet .
Bounty Boat expedition arrives in West Timor
The crew re-creating Captain William Bligh ’s ‘ Mutiny on the Bounty ‘ have completed their expedition after arriving in Kupang , West Timor .
Australian skipper Don McIntyre , together with compatriot Dave Pryce and Britons Chris Wilde and David Wilkinson have sailed a 25ft gunter - rigged launch for the last seven weeks since leaving Tonga .
Determined to get a feel for what Bligh really went through , the expedition aboard the Bounty Boat – a seven - foot wide , open wooden vessel – saw the crew face the same deprivations as those encountered by the original crew , including no charts , only two weeks of water and little food or everyday luxuries , such as a torch and even toilet paper .
It is the first time anyone has ever successfully re-created the mutinous voyage , under the same conditions and with the same navigational equipment as Captain Bligh , who embarked on the 4,000 mile open boat journey through the Pacific Ocean 221 years ago .
Much like the original voyage the crew has encountered its fair share of challenges – they survived a knockdown and McIntyre passed three kidney stones en route .
In her first press conference after her caucus victory , Australia 's new Prime Minister Julia Gillard went as far as she could on short notice in backing down on the resources profits tax , and offering the mining industry a new round of negotiations .
The industry and the heavyweight miners must now grasp the olive branch she has offered , and proceed in good faith to negotiate an outcome that they and the Gillard Government can accept .
Gillard refused to discuss what she said were the ' ' parameters ' ' of her proposed new negotiations with the miners about a tax .
But she said that the government would :
ENTER into negotiations , rather than the ' ' consultations ' ' that were occurring under Kevin Rudd 's leadership , with resources minister Martin Ferguson back in the loop beside her new Deputy , Wayne Swan , in the talks .
CANCEL the government 's advertising campaign for the tax it had earlier announced :
CALL on the mining industry to show good faith by cancelling its advertising campaign opposing the tax :
NEITHER rule things in nor rules things out of the new negotiations :
MAINTAIN that the government would still require that the miners pay a ' ' fairer share ' ' of the wealth the resources boom is generating .
The last comment should not cause too much alarm .
At the top of the big mining groups , the concern about the new tax has been about its design and its severity , not about the concept that the tax overall would rise .
And the move by Martin Ferguson to the centre of the proposed new negotiations should be welcomed by the miners : he is respected by them , and was not closely involved in the original decision .
Post - coup talks
There is political intent , of course , as Gillard positions herself and the government for an election that could come as soon as August : if the industry accepts her proposals , the negotiations that begin will certainly run into the election campaign and beyond , potentially defusing the war that has been waged since the original tax was announced .
The key test on the government side for whether the strategy works politically will be in Western Australia and Queensland , where its polling shows that the tax is key factor in its loss of support .
But Gillard appears to have made genuine concessions , and to have done so speedily .
It was only yesterday for example , as the coup against him was gathering strength , that Kevin Rudd told parliament that while it was working to achieve a ' ' balanced ' ' outcome , '' The government is committed to the framework that it has put forward .
The framework is a profits based tax , a 40 per cent tax , a tax that also applies to existing projects and a tax capable of delivering the revenue to meet the government 's policy priorities and to broaden the base of our economy . ''
With Gillard in charge , that inflexibility appears to have gone , and it is difficult to see how the industry can reasonably ask for more from her at this stage , if it confirms that in new negotiations for a new tax all aspects other than the need for the government to raise more from the industry are up for discussion .
Miners respond
It remains to be seen however whether the industry will present a united and constructive front today .
BHP responded quickly , saying it was '' encouraged by the comments of new Prime Minister Julia Gillard , that her Government will open the doors for negotiation with the objective of achieving consensus , '' had '' immediately asked our agencies to suspend all advertising as a sign of good faith , '' and looked forward '' to working with the Government in this new way to find a solution that is in the national interest . ''
But the Association of Mining & Exploration Companies was more aggressive , with chief executive Simon Bennison stating that Gillard must immediately announce the ' ' complete withdrawal of the proposed toxic mining tax in order to restore Australia 's reputation as a safe , reliable and financially attractive place in which to invest " .

No need to look at her wrists ( Image : Jeremy Atkinson and Michelle Rowe )
Which face is more attractive ?
If you chose the face on the left , you share the tastes of most heterosexual men .
It is a composite face , or “ morph ” , made from the faces of eight women with unusually small feet .
The face on the right is a morph of eight women with unusually large feet .
It ’s quite a difference , is n’t it ?
Women with smaller feet have prettier faces , at least according to the men who took part in this study .
So do women with longer thigh bones and narrower hips , as well as women who are taller overall .
And the contest is n’t even a close one .
“ These are the most strikingly different morphs I ’ve ever seen , ” says Jeremy Atkinson , an evolutionary psychologist at the University at Albany , New York .
Atkinson and his colleague Michelle Rowe measured hand length , foot length , thigh length and hip width on 60 white female college students , then adjusted each measurement to account for individual differences in overall height .
For each of 16 body - part measurements , they selected the eight women with the shortest lengths and the eight with the longest , and constructed morphs of their faces .
These morphs were then rated for attractiveness by 77 heterosexual male students .
Advertisement
The men were three - and - a - half times as likely to pick the short - footed morph as more attractive , and almost 10 times as likely to say it was more feminine , Atkinson and Rowe found .
Similarly , they were more than 11 times as likely to pick the narrow - hipped morph as more attractive , and eight times as likely to choose the long - thighed morph , the researchers reported at a meeting of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society in Eugene , Oregon , last month .
Tough beginnings
Atkinson thinks men find these features attractive because they serve as markers of a healthy childhood .
Biologists know that stress and poor nutrition during foetal development and puberty can affect sex hormone levels and cause earlier puberty .
This can leave such women relatively short and stout , while those with a more benign childhood continue growing for longer , and attain a slenderer , more stereotypically feminine face and body , which most men find more attractive .
Atkinson ’s explanation makes sense , says David Perrett , a psychologist at the University of St. Andrews , UK , who studies facial attractiveness .
Since faces and bodies are shaped by the same hormones , he says , you should be able to predict the attractiveness of one body part by looking at another .
Complicated men
The researchers also morphed 67 men and asked 82 heterosexual women to rate the attractiveness and masculinity of morphs of eight male faces , selected , as before , by the same 16 body part measurements .
The results were less clear - cut than they had been for women : the female viewers chose morphs of men with long torsos as being more attractive , but they also thought men with small wrists were more attractive .
Women may lack a consistent preference because powerful , masculine men can be a mixed blessing , evolutionarily speaking , says Atkinson .
“ If they go for a big alpha male , they ’ll get good genes , ” he says .
“ But they may be left to raise the child themselves . ”
Indeed , the women who took part in the study were twice as likely to rate the large - wristed morph as more open to sex without love , and by the same margin opted for the small - wristed morph as a better candidate for a long - term relationship .
Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
| || ( Dagbladet ) :
Hver mandag og torsdag må sykepleierne la pasienter være pasienter og sette seg bak rattet .
Det er hjemmesykepleien på Grorud i Oslo som er beordret til turkjøring to ganger i uka .
Bilene må luftes .
Guri Stoksbjerg er en av de ufrivillige bilturistene som to ganger i uken kjører fra Grorud til Olavsgård i nabokommunen Skedsmo .
- Det er klart det føles bortkastet .
Vi bruker jo arbeidstida til en masse unødvendig kjøring .
Vi vil jo helst gjøre jobben vår .
Jeg skulle ønske vi slapp disse kjøreturene i arbeidstiden , sier hun .
Felles innkjøp
Det var ved årsskiftet at Grorud bydel anskaffet ni biler av merket Fiat Grande Uno .
Leasingavtalen varer i tre år og er en del av samkjøpsavtalen som gjelder for Oslo kommune .
Avtalen innebærer at kommunen gjennom utviklings - og kompetanseetaten ( UKE ) sentralt forhandler fram priser .
Bydelene bestiller deretter biler som er godkjent av UKE .
Da Grorud bydel ved årsskiftet skulle fornye en del av bilparken , falt valget på Fiaten fordi den er romslig , miljøvennlig og rimelig .
Men etter kort tids bruk begynte de å få problemer med bilene .
- Vi leverte bilene til verksted , men det viste seg at det ikke var noe galt med dem .
Bilene har et dieselpartikkelfilter som må « blåses ut » et par ganger i uka .
I hjemmesykepleien er det stort sett småkjøring , så bilene kommer ikke opp i de hastighetene som trengs .
For å forhindre at filtrene går tett må bilene på tur , sier sier Bente Almås , leder ved for en av avdelingene ved hjemmesykepleien i Grorud bydel .
Det hadde ingen gitt beskjed om da bydelen valgte bilene .
Da det ble oppdaget , var det for seint .
Løsningen ble å beordre personalet på langtur .
Hver mandag og torsdag setter de seg bak rattet for å « lufte bilene » , som det nå heter på pauserommet .
Det tilsvarer ni arbeidstimer i uken bare på å holde bilene kjørbare - nesten en kvart stilling .
- Det er klart at dette er en uvettig bruk av ressurser , sier Almås .
- Uhensiktsmessig -
Det er sikkert gode biler , men de egner seg ikke til bybruk .
De er svært uhensiktsmessige for oss .
Men avtalen strekker seg helt til 2013 , så vi må belage oss på mange lufteturer , sier hun .
Hun understreker imidlertid at dette ikke går ut over helsetilbudet i bydelen .
- Brukerne får de tjenestene de har krav på .
Vi tar heller inn ekstra folk om bilene må på service eller andre ting .
Det koster jo litt i drivstoff og bemanning , men den kostnaden er vi nødt til å ta .
Men vi ønsker ikke å bruke disse bilene lenger .
Vi forsøker nå å endre leasingavtalen og bytte modell , men har foreløpig ikke fått noe svar fra UKE , sier Almås .
- Da vi i juni skulle kjøpe nye biler valgte vi en annen type bil , legger hun til .
- Fulllstendig idioti
Det er en kjent sak i bilbransjen at dieselbiler med katalysator egner seg dårlig i byer .
Oslo kommune skal ha bestilt 400 av dem .
Bilekspert Jon Winding - Sørensen i Bilforlaget har liten forståelse for kommunens valg .
- I slike jobber er det fullstendig idioti å kjøpe dieselbiler med partikkelfilter .
Her burde man gått til innkjøp av bensinbiler uten slike filtre , sier Winding - Sørensen til Dagbladet .

I 2008 jublet Fiat over å ha vunnet anbudskonkurransen om kjøp , langtidsleie og administrasjon av en bilpark på over 1500 kjøretøy .
Biltypen som hjemmehjelpen på Grorud lufter ukentlig , vant i klassen småbiler .
Winding - Sørensen mener kommunens innkjøpere burde visst bedre .
Direktør Gunnar Wedde i UKE framforhandlet avtalen , men kjente ikke til problemene med partikkelfitrene .
Han henviser til Autolease , som er leverandøren av bilene .
Firmaets leder Haakon J. Marthinsen bekrefter avtalen med kommunen overfor Dagbladet .
- Vi har fått tilbakemelding om at det er åtte - ti biler av typen Fiat Punto som med veldig korte kjørelengder får problemer , sier han .
Samtaleemne Guri Stoksbjerg trives godt i hjemmesykepleien på Grorud , hvor hun har jobbet i 11 ½ år .
Men det siste halvåret har kollegene på Grorud fått et nytt samtaleemne i lunsjpausene .
- Det er jo ironisk at vi fikk nye miljøbiler , men vi ender med å kjøre to unødvendige langturer hver uke for å lufte dem .
- Det er kanskje noen av brukerne deres som kunne tenke seg en luftetur også ?
- Det kan godt tenkes , det , ja !
Image caption Jamie was locked in his world
Jamie Ponsonby cannot speak , and for years he was trapped in his own world .
But his family taught him to type and now the 13 - year - old , who has autism , can not only express himself , but also write poetry .
His mother , Serena , said this had enabled them to finally communicate with Jamie and to understand him better .
" We had no idea that there was a person in there who knew everything , " she said .
Humorous and emotional
" Through the typing we have discovered he knows all sorts of things .
" He is completely on the ball , his sense of humour is completely all there .
He has beautiful poetry , his feelings and emotions are all perfectly normal and above average for his age . "
As a family , it has allowed us to know there is someone there who knows everything that is going on Serena Ponsonby
Richard Mills , Research Autism 's research director , said that cases like Jamie 's are relatively unusual .
He said a method called facilitated intervention was first introduced in Australia in the 1970s , where someone supports a client 's hand , wrist or arm while that person uses a communicator to spell out words , phrases or sentences .
But Mr Mills said this had proved highly controversial when it was independently reviewed .
But he said independent typing did work for some .
" We know that people with autism often need a lot of processing time .
" They need things to be visual , so words typed via a keyboard tend to be better . "
Serena , from London , said that although Jamie 's typing is slow - it took him two weeks to type his autism poem - he is speeding up and needs less prompting to write .
She realised there was a problem with her son when he was around 18 months old .
An extract from Jamie 's autism poem Image caption Jamie can now communicate with his family
Do you know the real world of autism
Do you know how it feels to be autistic
Do you know what it means to be autistic
Go to my world , you will see Go to my world , you will know Go to my world , you will hear Go to my world , you will feel it Go to my world , you will detect
Go to my world , you will find out Go to my world , you will discover
" He was diagnosed at two - and - a - half , but from 18 months I knew something was not right .
He used to love music but he would start screaming when I took him to music lessons , " she said .
Over the next few years Jamie lost more and more skills , including speech .
He had limited signing ability , so communication became difficult .
Serena said : " We started him typing at nine after I read a book about someone who found it easier to type , even though she could talk .
" It struck a chord and I thought maybe it would just be a different pathway .
" We started getting him to type the words he knew how to sign and made very , very slow progress .
We often thought of giving up .
" After a couple of years he started reading signs and we saw that he could read .
" We started asking him questions and he would type all sorts of things we had no idea he knew .
" As a family it has allowed us to know there is someone there who knows everything that is going on .
" He loves going travelling , and if you know he is getting something out of it your patience is increased .
" You do n't talk to him as someone who does n't understand - his self esteem and confidence are miles better . "
Such changes have a lot of people worried , including the Securities and Exchange Commission .
It released a wide - ranging paper earlier this year seeking suggestions on how to restructure the entire equity market , and created a Division of Risk , Strategy , and Financial Innovation in part to help monitor new technologies .
A market collapse in early May — in which automated - trading systems exacerbated a sell - off that drove the Dow down more than 900 points in less than an hour , before it quickly recovered — gave two worries new public salience : that the proprietors of these algos may not be in full control of their creations , and that the strategies they pursue are , in some cases , fundamentally warping the financial markets .
In January , the NYSE fined Credit Suisse $ 150,000 for “ failing to adequately supervise the development , deployment , and operation of a proprietary algorithm . ”
The fine was a pittance , but more troubling was that the bank did n’t even know that its malfunctioning algo ( which sent hundreds of thousands of cancel - and - replace requests for orders that had n’t been made ) had crippled some of the NYSE ’s trading stations until regulators called them the next day .
This spring , a newsletter from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago warned : “ Although algorithmic trading errors have occurred , we likely have not yet seen the full breadth , magnitude , and speed with which they can be generated .
Furthermore , many such errors may be hidden from public view . ”
Bernard Donefer , a finance professor at Baruch College and the author of a study in the most recent Journal of Trading called “ Algos Gone Wild , ” contends that the speed of these equations , and their ability to reach so many markets simultaneously , could turn even a minor coding error into a spiraling disaster .
“ Another 1987 , ” he told me , referring to the epic crash caused in part by simpler automated - trading schemes .
This view puts Donefer in the minority in the financial community , which tends to have more faith in firms ’ internal risk controls .
But he thinks that without better regulation , more algo - gone - wild scenarios are inevitable .
He notes that while controls at big firms , like Citi , are generally exemplary , second - and third - tier firms present a graver risk .
The SEC wants to hire a lot more staffers , both for its new risk division and for its trading division , and it is considering new methods of tracking algorithmic trades ;
Donefer and others have suggested a tagging system for the biggest traders , which the SEC says is on the table .
The commission also may soon outlaw a practice called “ naked access , ” in which some broker - dealers offer their clients direct access to exchanges — allowing them to potentially bypass risk controls — in pursuit of faster trading .
A more widespread worry , now getting increased attention from regulators and Congress , is a strategy known as high - frequency trading .
Employers of this technique apply algorithms and other automated technology , along with real - time market data , to buy and sell so quickly ( in microseconds ) and in such quantities ( millions of trades a day ) , that they engorge themselves on penny differentials in prices .
These traders argue that they supply the market with needed liquidity and tighter spreads .
Regulators tend to agree , for the most part ; free markets have always rewarded better information , speed , and creativity .
But this technology unloads on such a massive scale , and so quickly , that they fear it could feed a dangerous and self - reinforcing volatility .
​ A retired Los Angeles Police Department deputy chief , a previous San Jose chief of police and a former superior court judge from Orange County have all signed the official ballot argument in favor of Proposition 19 , California ’s statewide measure to legalize , tax and control marijuana .
“ Outlawing marijuana has n’t stopped 100 million Americans from trying it , ” says the pro-legalization ballot argument from the veteran law enforcers .
“ But we can control it , make it harder for kids to get , weaken the cartels , focus police resources on violent crime and generate billions in revenue and savings . ”
“ We need a common sense approach to control marijuana , ” the argument reads .
The signers , Los Angeles Deputy Chief of Police Stephen Downing ( Ret. ) , San Jose Chief of Police Joseph McNamara ( Ret. ) and Judge James Gray ( Ret. ) are all members of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) , an international organization of police , prosecutors and judges who are working to change failed marijuana laws .
The three signatories are among dozens of California police officers , judges and prosecutors who are actively campaigning to help voters understand that the current prohibition on marijuana represents a grave threat to public safety by empowering the violent cartels and gangs that control the illegal market , according to Tom Angell , media relations director with LEAP .
A CBS - 5 / Survey USA poll out this week shows Prop 19 leading 50 percent to 40 percent among likely voters .
The incursion comes hours after Israeli aircraft struck at bridges and a power plant in the Gaza Strip .
Cpl Gilad Shalit was abducted by Palestinian militants during a raid on an Israeli post near Gaza on Sunday .
Israel had warned of a massive military assault if he was not freed and its tanks have been massing along the border with Gaza for several days .
It is unclear how many troops are being used in the operation , launched from the Kerem Shalom crossing near southern Gaza .
This major incursion comes less than a year after Israel pulled soldiers and thousands of settlers from Gaza , which it had first occupied in 1967 .
Since completing the withdrawal in September 2005 , the Israeli army has regularly shelled targets in Gaza in an attempt to halt the firing of rockets into Israel by Palestinian militants .
Many Palestinian militants and civilians have been killed in the shelling .
' Limited operation '
The Israeli forces have taken up position near the town of Rafah , shortly after passing Gaza 's disused international airport .
According to the BBC's Gaza correspondent , Alan Johnston , the troops ' objective appears to be fairly limited - they have not entered Rafah and are camping on farmland outside the city .
An Israeli military spokeswoman said the soldiers were planning to set up observation posts .
The Associated Press news agency quotes Palestinian witnesses as saying the troops had entered the area under the cover of tank shells .
Palestinian militants anticipating an Israeli assault have been erecting barricades and preparing hideouts and ambush positions .
A spokeswoman for the Israeli armed forces said they had not encountered any resistance from the Palestinians .
Israeli military officials have been quoted as saying Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had backed a " limited operation " targeting the " terrorist infrastructure " .
Gaza 's militants have been readying defences
Hours before the ground assault , Israeli jets attacked three bridges and a power plant in the Gaza Strip .
The Israeli military confirmed the first strike on the bridge was aimed at stopping militants from moving Cpl Shalit .
The strike on the plant plunged much of Gaza into darkness .
It is not yet clear if there were any casualties .
Cpl Gilad Shalit was captured when Palestinian militants burrowed under the Gaza border and attacked an Israeli army position , killing two soldiers .
Israel has rejected the militants ' demands for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails to be freed in exchange for information about the soldier .
' United front '
Earlier on Tuesday , rival Palestinian factions , Hamas and Fatah , agreed a document outlining a common political platform .
As part of the agreement , Hamas said it would accept a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza - while maintaining its refusal to recognise the legitimacy of Israel .
The Hamas government also authorised the Fatah leader and President of the Palestinian Authority , Mahmoud Abbas , to conduct negotiations with Israel .
A Fatah official said the aim of the deal was to present a united front in talks .
The BBC's Middle East editor , Jeremy Bowen , says there is little in the document to hint at a longer - term peace deal with Israel .
There is no peace process on the ground , he says , and the dynamic of violence in the area has outpaced efforts at peace .
