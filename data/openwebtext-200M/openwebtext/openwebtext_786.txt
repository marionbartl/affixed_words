Recently , an economist gained notoriety and filled his appointment diary with lucrative conferences by having some of his forecasts for U.S. economic data , made two years ago and looking quite eccentric at the time , come gloriously true .
This random event inspires me to put forward the sketch of a theory of rational forecasting .
Suppose that 500 of the most distinguished academic , industry , and Wall Street economists are polled for their best guess of the U.S. unemployment rate and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 12 months from now .
As each has a reputation to preserve , none will stick his neck out with an outlandish forecast that has but a tiny probability of coming out right — even though it would earn him a jackpot if it did .
Therefore , the forecasts of the 500 will cluster in a narrow range of , say , 7 –11 percent for the unemployment rate and between 7500 and 9500 for the Dow .
What is left for the 250,000 other , less - distinguished economists to do to gain fame and fortune ?
They too can offer forecasts and might put them on some record .
If they place them in the cluster and the actual outcome is in the cluster , they remain unremarked and neither gain nor lose anything .
If they go way outside the cluster and the outcome is in the cluster , nobody will remember the wrong forecast made a year earlier .
They will again gain nothing and lose nothing .
If their forecast is in the cluster and the actual outcome is way outside it , they will be in the good company of their 500 more - distinguished fellows and will again remain unremarked .
There is , therefore , a single rational forecasting mode for our undistinguished economist to adopt .
Let him think of a number for the unemployment rate and one for the Dow Jones index — say 23 percent and 4000 , respectively .
He can easily draft a scenario for the next 12 months full of horrors and glitches that would make the forecast numbers plausible .
The probability that either one of his numbers will turn out right is very small and that both will turn out right is even smaller .
As we have seen , if both his numbers are wrong , he is no worse off .
But if one is right , he is richly rewarded , while if both his numbers are right , he gets riches beyond the dreams of avarice ( RBDA ) .
In slightly more formal terms , he has access to a positive - sum game against nature .
The worst payoff is zero and the best is RBDA .
The sum is necessarily positive , for no matter how infinitesimally small the probability of a really horrible scenario , it can not be zero .
If he is rational , in the sense that his choice maximizes the expected value of the outcome , our economist must forecast horrors .
It would seem that many are in fact engaged in this positive - sum game .
Of course , the more that do so , the more the horror story becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .
This calls to mind Blaise Pascal , the seventeenth - century French philosopher who taught that it was a command of reason to be God- fearing , for the reward , eternal salvation , had infinite value and however small one judged the probability that there was a God , the probability - adjusted value of infinity was still infinity .
One might add that if one did not fear God , the smallest probability that He existed would put the expected value of eternal damnation at minus infinity .
There are , to my knowledge , no records showing how many people became God-fearing under the weight of Pascal ’s somewhat brazen appeal to canny calculation .
Nor do we know how many blood - curdling economic forecasts are the result of career planning rather than sincere professional conviction .
What we do know , though , is that such forecasts are the best method of deepening the gloom , frightening the credulous , and making the worst more probable .

Descripción enviada por el equipo del proyecto .
El terreno por ser el principio de una vaguada , presentaba una topografía accidentada y al mismo tiempo hacía que el terreno se encontrara altamente poblado de árboles y fauna .
Desde la primera visita al terreno se decidieron los dos principios de diseño : ser parte de esa naturaleza , vivirla y tocarla ; y aprovechar la vista al mar y a las fincas de café .
Para ser parte de la naturaleza decidimos hacer un recorrido largo en medio de los árboles y disfrutar de la vida en los tres niveles : bajo las copas , al nivel de las copas y sobre las copas para al mismo tiempo poder disfrutar de la vista .
Esto provocó una casa angosta para ir mezclándose en medio de los árboles y evitar excesivos trabajos de terracería por la fuerte inclinación .
En segundo lugar , se decidió ocupar el concepto de la terraza para poder sentirse al exterior la mayor parte del tiempo excepto en los espacios íntimos y los baños .
Para poder generar esta sensación quise ensayar sobre el concepto del escultor Oteitza de los vacíos encadenados , evidenciando el vacío , absorbiéndolo con unas grandes paredes de cemento que se pliegan y se convierten en el piso y que definen y separan el área vivible del espacio natural .
Para poder disfrutar de la vista , se creó un mirador mezanine de madera apoyado sobre esta gran plataforma de concreto .
Los cerramientos de la casa son agregos , parches que se desentienden de la masa de concreto para poder reforzar la idea de un solo elemento que tiene que ser protegido del clima ( la lluvia , específicamente ) , al igual que el techo , que se maneja como un gran canopy liviano y desprendido de la estructura principal .
El vidrio permite que el exterior penetre en el espacio interior .
Estéticamente , este elemento de concreto cerrado por remiendos y soportado por puntales de acero , se relaciona con la forma de construcción que se ve especialmente en el interior del país .
Donde las construcciones se van desarrollando por temporadas y se van terminando con lo que se encuentra a la mano .
Además , son tan frágiles , que dan la impresión de que se van a desbaratar con la primera tormenta , al igual que las masas de Dalí soportadas por muletas .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Nothing seems to scare bankers , or their shareholders for that matter , more than the word " nationalization . "
Fears about the underlying health of banks have run so deep in recent days that there has been rampant speculation that the U.S. government may have to go so far as effectively seize control and manage one , if not more , of the country 's largest financial institutions .
These worries sent bank stocks into their latest downward spiral Tuesday -- shares of some of the biggest banks , including Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) fell by 20 % or more .
Although shares of these and other banks bounced back sharply Wednesday , most big bank stocks are still trading well below where they began this year .
Investors are concerned about the huge losses incurred by Citi and BofA and the rising amount of taxpayer money that the government is committing to support them .
Increasing signs that regulators in Britain may have to fully take over Royal Bank of Scotland also contributed to the recent nationalization fears in the U.S. Earlier this week , RBS ( RBS ) reported a loss of more than £ 20 billion ( $ 30 billion ) for 2008 , the biggest loss in British corporate history .
Other European countries have moved to assume control of their financial institutions including Iceland and Ireland , which just last week took over Anglo Irish Bank on fears that it could collapse .
U.S. regulators , however , have been averse to the idea even though they have already pumped billions of dollars into banks and the broader financial system .
But one expert notes there is a difference between government investments and government control .
" The key to nationalization is that the government actually owns and runs the institution , but so far that is not what they are doing , " said James Barth , a professor at Auburn University who also serves as a senior finance fellow at the Milken Institute , a nonpartisan economic think tank .
" The U.S. is a long way from that sort of model . "
Of course , both Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) and Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) were effectively nationalized in early September when the government stepped in and placed the two mortgage buyers into conservatorship .
But those two firms were already companies that had federal charters and were implicitly backed by the government .
Others might contend that AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) has also been nationalized .
The government extended more than $ 150 billion in aid to the insurance giant since September .
However , even though the government does own a majority stake in AIG , the company 's management team is still trying to sell assets in order to repay its loan .
The problem with nationalization
Bank regulators , most notably Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chief Sheila Bair , have downplayed speculation in recent weeks that a major bank may have to be nationalized .
Such an action would certainly prove costly for the government .
But analysts warn that it would also wipe out common shareholders ' existing stake and effectively close the door to private investors such as leveraged buyout firms and hedge funds .
Many believe these investors could be an integral source of capital in the months ahead as banks struggle with more troubled loans .
The government may also be wary of nationalization simply because it has hardly proven effective when other nations took over large financial institutions .
France did it in the 1980s , but those efforts failed miserably , prompting the government to take those banks private again .
Some east Asian countries nationalized banks during that region 's financial crisis in the late 1990s , but those banks soon devolved into inefficient state - run institutions .
" There have been state - owned banks that have mismanaged their risk so badly that they too have failed , " said Gerard Caprio , a professor of economics at Williams College , who spent part of his career at the World Bank and Federal Reserve focusing on the financial sector .
There are other headaches that come attached with nationalizing a bank , including finding and appointing new management to run the company .
Some analysts wonder whether U.S. regulators could put a team in place that was even capable of running one large bank with massive global operations , let alone several of them .
Dwindling options
Nonetheless , the government is expected to continue to take an increasing stake in some of the nation 's biggest banks as the crisis drags on -- even if it stops short of full - blown nationalization .
The Treasury Department now owns about $ 90 billion of preferred shares and warrants in Citigroup and Bank of America , and some analysts fear that number could grow in the months ahead .
Other banks may also need a second round of funding from the government as the U.S. economy sours .
To a large extent , the federal government has become one of the few remaining sources of capital for banks as private investors stay on the sidelines .
At the same time , banks ' ability to raise money through a sale of common stock has dwindled alongside their falling stock price .
" When your stock is selling at very low levels it is an inefficient and ineffective way to raise common equity , " said Gary Townsend , president of the Chevy Chase , Md. - based Hill - Townsend Capital .
" Having to raise it in this environment is very punishing . "
More government funds could be injected directly into banks via the second half of the government 's $ 700 rescue package , but many industry observers are quick to point out that the Obama administration will take pains to limit its involvement .
" The goal is not to nationalize the private sector , but to facilitate getting everything back in the hands of the private sector , " said Barth .
" Everything is geared for the government to be involved on more or less a temporary basis . "
In an earlier article on music criticism , I suggested that writers too often try to convince themselves that the bands and records they cover are historically important .
They differentiate every sound of one four - piece , lo - fi rock band from another and then ironically group everyone together at the end of the year under some all - encompassing theme as if to claim ownership to a cultural movement .
Remember 2002 ?
It was the “ raw rock revival ” that featured The Strokes , The Hives , The White Stripes , and The Vines .
Does n’t that sound perfectly crafted for a Rolling Stone cover ?
Of course the media ’s focus on this trend subsequently helped these bands gain equal exposure , even though The Hives were somewhat of a sideshow act and The Vines just plain sucked .
Now in 2009 , we ’re being told it ’s either bands with double - v names — Wavves , Lovvers — or the litter of “ girl ” groups that pretty much sound the same — Girls , Little Girls , Dum Dum Girls .
My biggest gripe with this trend is not its ubiquity , but that the selected themes are uninteresting .
Instead of highlighting diverse musical influences , the focus is put on trivial details , like band names .
For example , 2008 was arguably one of the most successful years ever for African music .
Reissue labels like Soundway , Strut , and Analog Africa put out multiple , critically acclaimed albums that have transformed the standard box set .
African music blogs like Benn Loxo , Matsuli , Comb and Razor , and Likembe got attention in the mainstream press .
Even Metacritic ’s highest rated album of the year was from a blind African couple .
Still , no one felt compelled to tout 2008 as the year of African soul & funk .
Instead it was catalogued as a year without any real trend .
Granted , my argument is in vain .
Any trend is primarily influenced by one ’s musical tastes .
My perception of last year ’s musical output is clearly different than that of someone who does n’t like African music .
But ca n’t we spread our wings so we ’re not constantly fed bedroom noise - pop ?
Diatribe finished , here ’s my own trend alert contribution to the music community : Eastern sounds .
There is nothing novel about this trend or even really marketable to a mainstream audience .
DJs have been sampling eastern sources for decades , usually with the intent to chop it up in an electronic blend or to add rap vocals .
Usually , when they find the right breaks , they hijack the record and get out of there .
The three artists listed below are different though .
They ’re DJs and producers by trade , but they ’re also individuals on a spiritual quest — hoping to find a sense of identity in the music they collect and create .
DJ Smokestack
Arjuna Sayyed , also known as DJ Smokestack , has been to India on three occasions .
The first two trips were for spiritual guidance .
The last one was for aural pleasure .
With his portable turntable in hand , Sayyed dug through stacks of moldy , maggot - eaten record sleeves in search of Bollywood funk and disco sounds .
Despite monsoons , power outages , and cramped spaces , Sayyed came away with an unbelievable collection of local music as well as an enlightening experience .
At the end of his trip , Sayyed ’s newfound friends asked him to perform a break dance routine in front of their record store .
It ’s appropriate that one cultural exchange be followed by another .
To hear his full story and listen to some of the music he collected during his trip , check out this article he wrote for Wax Poetics .
DJ Soulscape
One of the first quotes you ’ll see on Soulscape ’s DJ - collective website is this charmingly awkward yet powerful mission statement :
It is the goal of 360 Sounds that each DJ with different characters supplies fresh music of their own repertoire with diversity even it might be a little strange for somebody .
Because they believe listening fresh music alerts creative spirits and makes our soul sound and vibrant just like having fresh vegetable sustains us healthy .
Based in Seoul , the 360 Sounds group is a bubbling mix of American hip - hop , skateboarders , graffiti artists , and club culture .
I can only guess the result is a string of awesome house parties that mirror every high school shindig depicted in American films where skaters mix with blonde bimbos and some lanky kid commands a way - too - fresh turntable setup .
As an artist , radio host , and party promoter , DJ Soulscape is one of the founding members of this young movement .
His musical contributions are clearly rooted in hip - hop and funk , but he also holds on to his heritage .
On his latest mixtape , The Sound of Seoul , he dips into soul , funk , and boogaloo , but with an especially local taste .
The music is meant to conjure up images of the Han River at midnight or the youth - filled Myung - dong street fashion district .
Like all great students of music , DJ Soulscape is both a purveyor of new sounds and an archeologist , which makes 360 Sounds a perfect blend of this and this .
Onra
I have n’t stopped listening to or talking about Onra for the past year .
His phenomenal album Les Chinoiseries , a mix between J Dilla and Cambodian Cassette Archives , finds an extremely rare middle ground between monstrous club anthem music and untouchable grace and beauty .
The personal story behind the music is equally touching .
Onra was raised in France but has family ties to Vietnam .
In 2006 , he traveled to Saigon to reconnect with the land of his grandparents .
He returned to Paris with more than two dozen records in tow and set out to create a sort of musical self - portrait .
The result is a diverse collection of gorgeous string music , hip - hop stomps , and hypnotic loops .
If there ’s any album out there that perfectly expresses the relationship of self - identity and environment , this is it .
Katie Holmes Pregnant
One of Hollywood 's hottest couples may just be expecting another child .
and his lovely wifehave both been glowing lately and speculation is running wild that she is pregnant .
The lovebirds were seen at the Ivy restaurant on January 21st .
Tom was photographed with his hand placed on his wife 's tummy and they were looking into each others eyes like two kids in love .
Katie 's rep is denying the pregnancy but time will tell .
Their friends say that if the actress is not already pregnant she will be soon .
We wonder how little Suri will feel about having another sister or brother .
Connor and Bella are older so they probably give her all the attention she wants , but if another baby comes into the picture that could change .
We doubt it !!

A Japanese spacecraft has begun a mission to help scientists understand and monitor how the Earth 's climate is changing .
Gosat is a two - tonne Earth - orbiting satellite which will map the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , and where they are .
The probe was blasted into space from the Tanegashima launch site in southern Japan on Friday .
It will orbit the planet at an altitude of 666 km during its five - year mission .
Japan 's Space Agency Jaxa says Gosat ( Global Greenhouse Observation by Satellite ) will " contribute to the international effort toward prevention of ( global ) warming " .
They say that monitoring greenhouse gases is vital to promote and support measures designed to mitigate climate change .
The Kyoto Protocol came into force in February 2005 and is a comprehensive set of rules for reducing and restricting greenhouse gas emissions .
Go to source The Gosat mission is designed to identify and monitor sources of CO2 , to support compliance with international treaties and agreements such as Kyoto .
Gosat will greatly improve monitoring of greenhouse gases
But it could also shed light on a key problem in climate science .
Only about 50 % of carbon emitted into the atmosphere , for example from fossil fuel combustion and land use , stays there .
Most of the remainder is mopped up by the forests and oceans , which act as " sinks " .
However , there appears to be a large carbon sink missing .
" Based on our best knowledge about the forest and ocean net sinks , we are ' missing ' a carbon sink of 1 - 3 petagrams , " said Paul Palmer , a collaborator on the mission from the University of Edinburgh .
For comparison , one petagram is equivalent to about one million , million kilograms .
Gosat ( also known by its Japanese name Ibuki ) will take measurements of two key greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and methane ( CH4 ) - over nearly the entire surface of the planet .
It will carry two sensors , a Fourier Transform Spectrometer ( FTS ) and a Cloud and Aerosol Imager ( CAI ) .
Emission and absorption
The FTS uses the technique of optical interference to measure greenhouse gases from space .
The CAI will capture images of the atmosphere and the Earth 's surface , characterising thin clouds and airborne vapour .
This information will be used to correct measurements made by the FTS .
Another satellite designed to carry out greenhouse gas observations is the US space agency 's ( Nasa ) OCO ( Orbiting Carbon Observatory ) satellite .
Due for launch in late February , OCO can pinpoint the key locations on the Earth 's surface where CO2 is being emitted and absorbed .
" The OCO and Gosat satellites are trying to measure the same quantity .
However , their science objectives differ in subtle ways , " Paul Palmer explained .
" The primary objective of the OCO mission is to find the CO2 sinks .
The primary objective of the Gosat mission is to identify and monitor CO2 sources , to monitor treaty compliance .
But Gosat data will also be used to quantify sinks . "

We all have a lot of media on our computers , music , movies and even Ebooks .
What you need is to put all of the media in one place so everyone in the house can access the media easily .
Network Attached Storage or NAS is the perfect solution .
There are many NAS solutions out there but many carry a large price tag .
I have found a great solution called FreeNAS .
FreeNAS is just the way it sounds – FREE Network Attached Storage .
You just need some old hardware and away you go .
FreeNAS is packaged with basic file transfer services such as CIFS ( SMB ) , NFS , AFP , FTP , SFTP , and SCP .
In addition , FreeNAS sports some more advanced backup and file synchronization services , namely rsync for * NIX users and Unison for cross- platform file synchronization .
Also included is a UPnP media server with a built - in web based control page .
This is great for sharing your media with your PS3 , Xbox360 or even your Windows Media Center computers .
FreeNAS also comes with a iTunes compatible server built in .
You can now serve all of your music to multiple computers on your network .
FreeNAS also supports iSCSI as both an initiator ( client ) and target ( server ) .
iSCSI is an alternative to Fibre Channel , common in large storage networks .
To round things out , FreeNAS also supports Dynamic DNS which periodically updates DNS servers with the NAS ’ IP address , a great feature for small home office users who use normal residential internet service which usually has a dynamic IP address .
FreeNAS ’s hardware configuration features are as complete as its software features .
FreeNAS supports software RAID in basic configurations RAID 0 , RAID 1 , RAID 5 , and JBOD and also supports complex arrays such as RAID 1+0 .
FreeNAS also supports encrypted volumes using the Geom Eli module .
This allows you to encrypt the entire hard drive ( or RAID array ) for extra security .
Since FreeNAS can be run on anything that FreeBSD runs on , the developers included some interesting and useful “ Miscellaneous ” features .
Those include a SMART Daemon , which monitors the health of SMART enabled hard drives and a Power Daemon , which monitors system loads and adjusts power states accordingly .
Also accessible via web configuration are advanced kernel tuning variables which allow advanced BSD users to tune certain kernel parameters to squeeze the maximum performance out of the hardware .
FreeNAS was easy to install , download and burn the current ISO of FreeNAS ; pop it in the CD drive ; set your BIOS to boot from CD ; and install .
The text - based install was fairly intuitive , even though the documentation was n’t 100 % clear on what the different install types were and was written for an older version of FreeNAS .
I made it through the install without problems .
The 32 MB OS did n’t take more than about 2 minutes to install on my test machine .
Once the OS is installed you can unhook that monitor and keyboard and put the FreeNAS box in a corner somewhere .
Now you grab your other computer and point your browser to the IP address of your FreeNAS box .
The web based user interface is very intuitive and easy to use .
Go through the basic setup and your network server is up and running .
There are so many configurations that you can change and setup , and it would be a lot for me to cover all of the options .
Poke around and check out the system .
FreeNAS is a cheap and easy solution for any home or small business .
It is great to house all of your MP3s and your Movies in one place .
Enjoy FreeNas and let us know if your using it today .
ORLANDO , Fla. , Jan. 18 ( UPI ) --
A couple known as SickNdehed and Psychovandal were married before fellow gaming enthusiasts at a video expo in the Orlando Science Center in Florida .
Desirai Labrada , 29 , aka SickNdehed , and John Henry , 27 , aka Psychovandal , met online playing Halo 2 , a video game about lobbing plasma grenades at aliens , the Orlando Sentinel reported Sunday .

They were married Saturday , with the bride wearing white , the groom wearing a tuxedo and the officiant dressed in the full body armor of a futuristic , alien - swatting supersoldier .
The couple had a Halo - themed wedding cake and planned to compete in a bride - versus - groom Halo tournament in the Science Center 's Cinedome .
" I just wanted my wedding to be a little more interesting than the average wedding , " said Labrada .
" Basically , I just wanted to play video games at my wedding . "
I ’ve been researching open source .NET and noticed that SharpDevelop , the free IDE for .NET on Windows , completed version 3.0 earlier this month .
Congratulations to the team .
Along with Windows Forms and ASP.NET applications in C# or Visual Basic , you get extras like support for F# , Boo and Python .
Another welcome feature is built - in support for Subversion version control .
There ’s even an ASCII table in the IDE , which brings back memories : 15 years ago every programming manual had one at the back .
SharpDevelop has two major challenges .
One is keeping up with Microsoft ; right now there are discussions about improving WPF support , for example .
The other is that Microsoft offers free Express versions of Visual Studio , which leaves SharpDevelop with those niche users for whom the Express products are unsuitable , but who do not want to pay for a full version , or who are wedded to some exclusive SharpDevelop feature .
In favour of SharpDevelop , it installs more easily and loads more quickly than Microsoft ’s effort , and certainly proves the point that native C# applications do not have to be slow .
A more interesting though less complete product is the forked MonoDevelop , which is cross platform and targets Mono , the open source implementation of .
NET .
Mono now looks good on Linux ; but the idea of WORA ( Write Once Run Anywhere ) has never really caught on in the .NET world .
How many significant Mono applications for Windows have you seen ?
My guess is that if it happens at all , it will be in the form of Silverlight / Moonlight running in the browser .
By their greed and folly they have helped to bring their ancient institutions to their knees .
They have helped to trigger a bankogenic recession that is now rippling out with appalling consequences through the wider economy .
They have come so close to causing a complete financial meltdown that it was necessary to bail them out with £ 37 billion of cash from the hard - pressed taxpayer .
And these bankers now have the cheek , the epic and obscene cheek , to say that at least some of that money – that taxpayers ' money !
– should be used to " incentivise " the former masters of the universe .
Incentivise them to do what ?
Reward them for what ?
You might as well give Lord Cardigan a bonus for the Charge of the Light Brigade .
" I think this mat would appeal people who miss a corner of nature in their appartment - perhaps if they live in an urban environment , far from parks and nature areas .

Official ground - breaking ceremonies took place for a gigantic new 500 meter diameter radio telescope in China which will allow astronomers to detect galaxies and pulsars at unprecedented distances .
The $ 102 million facility , known as the Five - hundred - meter Aperture Spherical Telescope ( FAST ) , will have a collecting area more than twice as big as the 305 meter diameter radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico , which has been the world ’s largest since it opened in 1964 .
Not only that , the new telescope will also have the ability to change its shape and move the position its focus .
Like the Arecibo telescope , the new telescope will sit in a natural depression that already is close to the shape of the collecting surface , simplifying the support structure and shielding the telescope from stray human - generated radio waves .
The location is quite remote , about 170 km by road from the Guizhou Province ’s provincial capital Guiyang , making it unusually radio- quiet , says Nan Rendong , FAST chief scientist and a researcher from the National Astronomical Observatories at the Chinese Academy of Sciences , in an article in Physicsworld.com .
The site ’s potential for long , uninterrupted observations — coupled with the telescope ’s huge size , which will give it twice the sensitivity of Arecibo — means that researchers there will be able to detect objects like weak , fast - period pulsars that are too faint to be measured accurately by smaller instruments .
“ The FAST science impact on astronomy will be extraordinary , ” Nan said , adding that although the telescope is located in China , once it is completed in 2014 it will be open to astronomers from around the world .
A system of motors attached to its 4600 panels will allow astronomers to change its shape from a sphere to a paraboloid , making it easier to move the position of the telescope ’s focus .
This will allow the south - pointing telescope to cover a broad swathe of the sky — up to 40 degrees from its zenith , compared to the 20 - degree - wide strip covered by Arecibo .
At first , however , the telescope will only be sensitive to low - frequency radio waves , less than 3 GHz .
Arecibo ’s bandwidth , by contrast , stretches up to 10 GHz .
A planned second phase of construction will extend FAST ’s range to 5 GHz , but a date for the upgrade has not yet been set .

Well , the money went somewhere - and apparently very little went into actually rebuilding Iraq :
Federal authorities examining the early , chaotic days of the $ 125 billion American - led effort to rebuild Iraq have significantly broadened their inquiry to include senior American military officers who oversaw the program , according to interviews with senior government officials and court documents .
Court records show that last month investigators subpoenaed the personal bank records of Col. Anthony B. Bell , who is now retired from the Army but who was in charge of reconstruction contracting in Iraq in 2003 and 2004 when the small operation grew into a frenzied attempt to remake the country ’s broken infrastructure .
In addition , investigators are examining the activities of Lt. Col. Ronald W. Hirtle of the Air Force , who was a senior contracting officer in Baghdad in 2004 , according to two federal officials involved in the inquiry .
It is not clear what specific evidence exists against the two men , and both said they had nothing to hide from investigators .
Yet officials say that several criminal cases over the past few years point to widespread corruption in the operation the men helped to run .
As part of the inquiry , the authorities are taking a fresh look at information given to them by Dale C. Stoffel , an American arms dealer and contractor who was killed in Iraq in late 2004 .
Before he was shot on a road north of Baghdad , Mr. Stoffel drew a portrait worthy of a pulp crime novel : tens of thousands of dollars stuffed into pizza boxes and delivered surreptitiously to the American contracting offices in Baghdad , and payoffs made in paper sacks that were scattered in “ dead drops ” around the Green Zone , the nerve center of the United States government ’s presence in Iraq , two senior federal officials said .
Mr. Stoffel , who gave investigators information about the office where Colonel Bell and Colonel Hirtle worked , was deemed credible enough that he was granted limited immunity from prosecution in exchange for his information , according to government documents obtained by The New York Times and interviews with officials and Mr. Stoffel ’s lawyer , John H. Quinn Jr .
There is no evidence that his death was related to his allegations of corruption .

China is reportedly using an increasing number of paid " Internet commentators " to scour the Internet for bad news so they can try to negate it in an attempt to control public opinion .
Chinese leaders are aware that the Internet is a place where views can be freely expressed so they pay close attention .
They use these " Internet commentators " to spread their propaganda by posting comments on websites and forums , trying to spin bad news into good news in attempts to shape public opinion .
China 's Communist Party leaders have tried to control this for years via the media .
Since extending that policy to the Internet , many websites have been blocked by a system that has been dubbed " the great firewall of China . " ( Source : bbc.co.uk )
Cyberspace is not as easy to control as traditional news outlets because comments , rumors and anonymous opinions quickly spread between Internet groups in a way that makes it hard for the government to censor .
In addition to trying to stop people from having their say , the Chinese government is attempting to change the way people think .
They use specially - trained Internet commentators -- dubbed the " 50 - cent party " -- who are paid 50 Chinese cents for each " positive " posting .
The Public Security Bureau in the city of Jiaozuo in Henan Province boasted about this approach in a recently released document that tells the story of one disgruntled citizen who posted an unfavorable comment about the police .
One of the Internet commentators reported this posting to the authorities within 10 minutes , whereupon the bureau used more than 120 people to spin the story around and change public opinion .
Chinese Internet commentators obviously need to show loyalty and support to the authorities .
A document from the hygiene department in the city of Nanning in Guzngxi province reveals a few other things they need : " they need to possess relatively good political and professional qualities , have a pioneering and enterprising spirit , and they need to be able to react quickly . "
Hiring Internet commentators began a couple of years ago by local governments who found it hard to control public opinion .
They came up with their own solution because Beijing could n't monitor and block every single piece of news .
Some experts claim that there are tens of thousands of these Internet commentators and there are reports that special centers have been set up to train them .
They have a lot of work ahead of them ; politically , the Internet is more important in China than in other societies because it 's the only public space where people can express themselves .
This concept is nothing new .
Some critics allege that the United States has been using propaganda to sway public opinion while controlling the media for years .
Information on identifying propaganda can be found from George Mason University .

Very little is known about this rimward planet ( hence the name ) and what is known only deepens the mystery of what secrets its wild and unstable atmosphere might be hiding .
Massive purple and silver clouds made primarily of a low - temperature plasma with vicious electromagnetic properties hide the planet ’s surface from both sight and sensors , while winds in excess of 380 kilometers per hour coupled with the seemingly random pockets of crushing gravity that form throughout the atmosphere keep even the bravest of researchers and scientists at bay .
Even ships as close as a high orbit have been known to disappear or be struck by plasma discharges cast off from the planet that melt through hull and shields alike , and the one research expedition daring enough to plunge headlong into the clouds of Enigma was never heard from again .

Oh god , it ’s beautiful .
Are you getting this , Marie ?
That tower , it ’s. . . oh no .

" The spirit is wandering until a proper burial has been performed .
The only way to put this into closure is to release the remains , his spirit , so that he can be taken back to his homeland in the Gila Mountains , at the head of the Gila River . "

A new study shows that pollution from automobiles and coal - fired power plants is contributing to the melting of mountain snowpacks up to a month early , exacerbating water shortages and polluting streams in the arid West .
We ’ve all seen it .
That white fluffy blanket of snow that looked so nice after it fell a couple weeks back is no longer white and fluffy .
It has been capped with a layer of dark sooty particulate matter , turning it from white to gray to black .
Having grown up in the Boston area , this was the reality of virtually every snowstorm I can recall from my youth .
But that dark , sooty particulate matter that builds up on the stale snow is not only an aesthetically unpleasing feature of urban landscapes in the winter , it happens in the North American snowscapes of the Rockies , the Sierra Nevadas and the Cascades – with far more serious consequences .
A peer - reviewed study conducted by scientists at the Department of Energy ’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , is the first to explore changes to snowmelt caused by soot pollution at a regional level .
The study , authored by Qian , Gustafson , Leung and Ghan , is scheduled to be published next month in the Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres .
The study found that particulate emissions from automobile tailpipes and industry smokestacks settles on snow - covered mountains and covers them with a dark layer that absorbs more sunlight and melts the snow faster .

“ Soot acts like tiny toaster ovens in the snowpack , and when the sun hits them , they heat up and melt the snow , ” said Charles Zender in an article at Energy & Environment ( Sub$cription req ’d. ) , an atmospheric physicist at the University of California , Irvine .
Zender peer - reviewed the Northwest Pacific National Laboratory study .
In a previous paper about the effects of dust layers on snowmelt , researchers found that dust affecting the San Juan Mountains snowpack originated in the Colorado Plateau , which includes parts of Utah , Colorado , New Mexico and Arizona .
The likely cause of this sudden uptick of dust particles was the expansion of grazing , agriculture , mining and increased recreational use of the land that is exposing soils to the wind , which in turn lifts the dirt into the atmosphere .
One of that paper ’s authors , Thomas Painter of the University of Colorado said about the phenomenon , “ Whenever we have fresh , relatively clean snow at the surface of the mountain , the runoff is muted .
As soon as the dust levels come back , you can see that the runoff starts back up . ”
Wide - ranging implications
The implications of the study ’s findings range from ecological to economic and political .
The expedited rate of snowmelt makes those dry summers of the American West that much tougher to stomach without rainfall .
And because concentrations of the particulate matter are so high in the summer months the effects on water quality could have devastating ecological impacts .
So , not only is there less water in summer months , the water that is available will have higher concentrations of dirt , ash and soot from as far away as China .
“ The important thing is the change in timing of available water , ” explained William Gustafson , an atmospheric scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and one of the study ’s primary authors .
In essence , there will be plenty of water in the early spring , when water availability is never a problem .
But come late summer , rivers are losing their water much earlier than before .
But faster runoff also means less water for farming and residential use , less potential for hydroelectric energy , shorter rafting and skiing seasons and less - than stellar fishing conditions .
For Rocky Mountain states like Colorado , Utah and Wyoming , the economic impact on the recreation industry alone , is reason alone to take this study ’s findings seriously .

But addressing the problem with real solutions is a political nightmare .
Water politics in the West is already tenuous , add to the situation drivers that begin across state and international borders , and you are left with what seems like a virtually untangleable knot .
You see , it just so happens that the changes needed in our infrastructure to clean up our automobiles , our factories , and our energy supply to mitigate the effects of rising amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , are the very same kinds of changes we need to reduce the amount of particulate emissions in the air that turns that snow black and melts it so hastily .
So we need to drive less overall , leading to less emissions and less danger : the Summit Disability Law Group can help with personal injury cases related to auto issues .

During the presidential campaign , a constant refrain of Barack Obama and other Democratic candidates was that the Bush administration had severely politicized intelligence , resulting in such disasters as the war in Iraq .
The irony of course is that , if anything , President Bush badly failed at depoliticizing a CIA that was often hostile to his agenda .
Witness the repeated leaks of classified information that undercut his policies .
It now appears Mr. Obama has appointed a highly controversial figure to head the National Intelligence Council , which is responsible for producing National Intelligence Estimates .
The news Web site Politico.com yesterday reported that it could confirm rumors that a former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia , Charles " Chas " Freeman Jr. , has been appointed chairman .
( My calls to the White House and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence produced neither confirmation nor denial . )
Without question , Mr. Freeman has a distinguished résumé , having served in a long list of State and Defense Department slots .
But also without question , he has distinctive political views and affiliations , some of which are more than eyebrow - raising .
In 1997 , Mr. Freeman succeeded George McGovern to become the president of the Middle East Policy Council .
The MEPC purports to be a nonpartisan , public - affairs group that " strives to ensure that a full range of U.S. interests and views are considered by policy makers " dealing with the Middle East .
In fact , its original name until 1991 was the American - Arab Affairs Council , and it is an influential Washington mouthpiece for Saudi Arabia .
As Mr. Freeman acknowledged in a 2006 interview with an outfit called the Saudi - US Relations Information Service , MEPC owes its endowment to the " generosity " of King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia .
Asked in the same interview about his organization 's current mission , Mr. Freeman responded , in a revealing non sequitur , that he was " delighted that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has , after a long delay , begun to make serious public relations efforts . "
A certain herd of 200 goats on a Massachusetts farm may look bucolic and quaint , but they actually comprise a living , breathing pharmaceutical factory , or " pharm . "
The goats have been genetically engineered t0 produce a blood - thinning drug in their milk , and a report from the FDA has just declared that the drug is effective and safe for human use .
An FDA advisory panel will make a recommendation this Friday on whether to approve the drug for sales ; if
the drug is approved , it would be the first application under new FDA regulations that allow animals to be genetically altered to produce drugs , model human disease , produce industrial or consumer products or improve their use as food [ USA Today ] .
The goats , which are being bred by the biotech company GTC Biotherapeutics , produce a protein called antithrombin that prevents blood clotting .
About 1 in 5,000 people do n't produce enough of the protein , putting them at risk of developing blood clots in their veins .
Such clots can be extremely painful .
If they break loose and travel through the bloodstream to the lungs or the brain , the consequences can be catastrophic .
Pregnant women with the disorder are at high risk of miscarriage or stillbirth , because of blood clots in the placenta [ AP ] .
While people with the deficiency typically manage their condition with conventional blood thinning drugs , such drugs are n't suitable for surgeries and childbirth , when the risks of blood clots are particularly high -- that 's where the new drug would come in .
GTC is also developing further studies to test the drug in patients at risk for clots in non-hereditary conditions such as coronary bypass surgery [ Reuters ] .
To make the drug , scientists at GTC put DNA for the human antithrombin protein into single cell embryos of goats .
Goat embryos with the gene were then inserted into the wombs of surrogate mothers who gave birth to baby goats carrying the new trait [ AP ] .
The transgenic female goats produce the protein in their milk , which is then refined and purified .
GTC
Biotherapeutics says that a single goat will produce more than six pounds of the protein in the course of a year , and also notes that the drug - producing trait will be naturally passed down to the next generation of goats .
Many biotech companies are investigating " pharming " techniques as a way to produce large quantities of protein drugs in a cheap way .
However , some consumer groups are deeply wary of genetically modified animals , whether their products end up in pharmacies or grocery stores .
" The regulatory process seems to have put the cart before the horse , analyzing the safety of the product before it has opined on the safety of the manufacturing process , " says Greg Jaffe of the Center for Science in the Public Interest .
" FDA clearly needs to impose cradle - to - grave conditions to prevent the goats from leaving the farm or their products from entering the food supply " [ USA Today ] .

All hot chicks love Taco Bell .
It ’s a fact .
I know , I know .
It flies in the face of all logic .
Other than maybe KFC , I can't think of a fast food joint that 's more disgustingly terrible for you .
It looks gross , smells gross , is gross .
But without fail , any time I 'm leaving a party / club / bar with one or more cute girls , it is demanded that I drive through Taco Bell ( they have to be drunk of course , otherwise their weight phobias would prevent them from indulging ) .
If my caluclations are correct , drunken hot girls make up around 61 % of Taco Bell 's late night drive thru clientele .
When I was in Europe , the girls I was with nearly drove me crazy every night asking our poor cabbies if he could drive through Taco Bell .
They just could n’t accept that there was actually a place in the civilized world that did n't have any .
Then they ’d start wistfully talking about cheesy burritos , Mexican pizzas , and beef gorditas like a bunch of stoned frat kids .
It would ’ve been creepy if it were n’t so bizarre ( and simultaneously hot ) .
I ’ve always found really hot girls pigging out kind of adorable , like the end of Footloose where all the kids who ’ve never danced before suddenly freak out on the dance floor .
But it does n’t work for me with Taco Bell .
It ’s like watching someone wax their Porsche with steel wool .
I just want to slap it out of their hands , “ It hurts me when you do this to yourself ! ”
What 's extra weird is that the over - weight girls I know do n’t adore Taco Bell .
In fact , most seem to hate it .
Whoever started Taco Bell must be a mad scientist .
He planned this all along .
Like a character in some cheesy 80's sex comedy , Mr. Bell must have created a special drug he puts in the " food " that , when combined with alcohol , makes sexy ladies ravenous for his heinous product .
I ’m telling you , you want to get a group of hot girls back to your place when the bar closes ?
Just have a sack of chalupas on hand and leave a trail of sour cream leading to your car .
Pair push the snowball into town .
Photograph : Ben Elijah
When the first flakes fell earlier this week , there were reports of police officers merrily taking part in snowball fights with the kind of feral children they would ordinarily be trying to give an asbo .
But four days into the UK's worst snowfall for 18 years , it would seem the patience of some officers has run out .
In Northampton today , the police were accused of " petty officiousness " after breaking up a " harmless " giant snowball that two young men had spent all morning building .
Ben Elijah , a 24 - year - old account manager , took pictures charting the progress of the gigantic snowball as it rolled through Northampton city centre right into the shovels of two special police constables .
The first photos show the pair struggling to push the ball , which measured 6ft ( 1.8 metres ) in diameter according to Elijah , past River Island and up the high street .
But before long their grubby creation captures the attention of two passing police officers in fluorescent jackets , who draw out their shovels and proceed to hack through the snow and move it out of the road .
Police take to the snowball with a shovel .

" It was one of those harmless moments when everyone there all pointed , smiled and had a laugh with total strangers .
The police stamped on it for no good reason , " Elijah told the Guardian .
" It just seemed like petty officiousness , as though his uniform gave him an opportunity to have a power trip . "
But a spokeswoman for Northamptonshire police told the Guardian that the officers were not " killjoys " but were simply trying to keep the road safe .
She said : " These were two special constables who were unable to get to their day jobs , so decided to do their bit for the community .
" When they saw the snowball , it had already been rolled through the city centre precinct and had been pushed into the middle of the road causing an obstruction , around a blind corner .
There was n't anyone with it at the time , and they decided that the sensible thing was to remove it , which they did . "
Nearly all of the London head office staff at the beleaguered retail investor Baugur will be made redundant today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Sources said that PricewaterhouseCoopers , the administrator to Baugur ’s UK arm , will inform staff today at its head office .
However , it is understood that Gunnar Sigurdsson , Baugur ’s chief executive , Jon Asgeir Johannesson , its chairman , and Andrew Lobb , the director of legal and operations , will keep their jobs .
Speculation is rife that Jeff Blue , the managing director of retail , might be one of those to be made redundant .
Baugur declined to comment on Mr Blue or the overall redundancy process .
Last week , Landsbanki was granted its petition to appoint PwC as administrator for BG Holdings , Baugur ’s UK arm that holds stakes in the toy retailer Hamleys , the department store House of Fraser , the frozen food retailer Iceland , and Aurum Holdings , which operates the retail jewellery chains Goldsmiths , Mappin & Webb , Watches of Switzerland and Mydiamonds.com .
PwC was unavailable for comment .
Question : what happens if you lose vast amounts of other people ’s money ?
Answer : you get a big gift from the federal government  but the president says some very harsh things about you before forking over the cash .
Am I being unfair ?
I hope so .
But right now that ’s what seems to be happening .
Just to be clear , I ’m not talking about the Obama administration ’s plan to support jobs and output with a large , temporary rise in federal spending , which is very much the right thing to do .
I ’m talking , instead , about the administration ’s plans for a banking system rescue  plans that are shaping up as a classic exercise in “ lemon socialism ” : taxpayers bear the cost if things go wrong , but stockholders and executives get the benefits if things go right .
When I read recent remarks on financial policy by top Obama administration officials , I feel as if I ’ve entered a time warp  as if it ’s still 2005 , Alan Greenspan is still the Maestro , and bankers are still heroes of capitalism .
“ We have a financial system that is run by private shareholders , managed by private institutions , and we ’d like to do our best to preserve that system , ” says Timothy Geithner , the Treasury secretary  as he prepares to put taxpayers on the hook for that system ’s immense losses .

I still get asked “ what Ajax framework should I use ? ” frequently indeed .
I think that people feel that with my Ajaxian postings I have seen every framework in the world and will have a magic feel for things .
I dread these questions , as context is king for making the decision , and “ feel ” is a major part of it too .
The various frameworks have in many ways come closer together over the years , so making the choice is harder , but also maybe not as big a deal as it once was .
That being said , I really enjoyed Glenn Vanderburg talk about why he prefers Prototype to jQuery .
This is the kind of subject that is asking for trouble and foaming at the mouth from people on various camps .
Glenn has the kind of nature , wisdom , and touch that makes it hard to think that way .
He gives thoughtful points and is n’t trying to cause a stir .
These days , without any real context ( e.g. skills on the team , what the project does ) I kinda think :
j Query is fantastic for taking a website and making it dynamic .
Easy .
elegant .
Beautiful .
If I was a designer doing a rich site I would stop here .
Dojo is fantastic for building a large scale application that will do a lot , and end up with a ton of JavaScript .
Everything you need will be found there .
This is n’t to say that Dojo ca n’t be used on the small anymore .
The new core is small and fast and good .
Prototype , for me , fits in between these worlds .
It is small enough to feel small ( not a huge library to learn ) yet large enough that I do n’t jump out into creating a lot of my own code .
On a recent jQuery project that grew fairly big and I found myself surprised that the core did n’t have certain methods and features .
Much of it was small things ( one example I remember is array utilities ) .
I would find myself looking around for plugins , wondering which ones are good , and generally having a little bit of a tough time .
Then there is a the type system .
For something that is n’t strapping on a bit of code to the web site , I actually like Class. extend and the like .
With jQuery I would use Traits or Base or something which is fine ….
but not just there in the same way .
I get used to myArray.last ( ) and having the convenience methods available to me directly on the objects , even if the puritan in me feels a little strange .
Just as Ruby “ felt right ” to me .
Prototype does too ( duh , since its heritage ) .
A blend of purity and pragmatism .
More often than not Prototype surprises me “ oh , wow , it has that function already ! ”
On another recent project that got converted to Prototype , I was able to delete a LOT of code .
Utility classes went away .
Libraries went away .
There is nothing better than the feeling of deleting code .
Am I right ? :)
So , I agree with Glenn .
For me , Prototype is the right balance for many of my projects .
I still enjoy playing and using others when the project calls for them , and I am ignoring the huge number of other great frameworks ( YUI , GWT , MooTools , Ext , SproutCore , Cappucino , man I could go on forever here ) .
Watching all of these dance shows on TV lately has made me a true believer in the power of dance .
If these shows continue to get such huge ratings then that means dancing is something I need to embrace .
I am now convinced that all of the problems and tough times in life will go away if I only dance .
Hey , it worked in all of those eighties ' breakdancing films : Breakin’ – dancing brings a rich girl from Beverly Hills and a “ thug ” from the streets together in love ( FYI watch this movie for no other reason than seeing an unknown Jean Claude Van Damme as an extra dancing in a spandex unitard ) .
Breakin’ 2 : Electric Boogaloo – dancing helps stop construction workers from tearing down a youth center .
Granted , I ’m sure the construction workers were union and only too happy not to work , but that ’s really just nitpicking , is n’t it ?
Fast Forward – dancing actually helps a group of teenagers to win a Battle of the Bands and earn them a record contract .
I ’m not sure that dancing has anything to do with playing music , but who am I to argue against the power of dance ?
[ Editors Note : Directed by Sydney Poitier ?
Seriously ?
WTF ? ]
And let ’s not forget the video from Michael Jackson ’s “ Beat It ” .
Come on !
If highly choreographed , perfectly synchronized , all male dancing can unite two warring street gangs then imagine what it can do for Israel and Pakistan .
There ’s really not a problem that dance ca n’t fix .
About to get fired at Starbucks ?
Just dance and watch your boss promote you to head barista .
About to get kicked out of your apartment ?
Just dance and witness your landlord allow you to stay – rent - free .
About to be dumped by your girlfriend ?
Just dance and see her go down on you …with her best friend … at Applebee ’s ... and it involves bacon .... let 's say for the sake of arguement , a club sandwich .
I ’m pretty sure we could cure AIDS if we only harnessed the magic qualities of dance .
Think about it .
No more disease , no more poverty , no more terrorism .
All of the world ’s problems would vanish and be replaced by everyone prancing around in a dance belt while giving Jazz Hands .
So , remember , whenever life gets you down and you feel like cutting your jugular with a rusty Coke can - just dance !
Crazy science , will you ever learn ?
Just because you can do something , does n't mean you should .
Sure , we could start transplanting monkey heads on humans , but you should n't .
The atom bomb sure as hell ended World War II , but it began an era of atomic fear and guilt .
We ended up with all kinds of hassles , like communism and bad Schwarzenegger movies .
This brings us to the crack team of Dave Soldier and Komar & Melamid , who scientifically created the world 's worst song .
It clocks in at over 20 minutes .
The trio has a Web site where they asked visitors to list their most hated sounds , be they operatic hip - hop with cowboy lyrics , swelling harps or marching - band music from hell .
They claim that " fewer than 200 individuals of the world 's total population will enjoy this , " but released it anyhow .
The site gets very scientific and is hella confusing .
The guys basically used the thought behind software that figures out the most desirable musical tones , and went the sadistic route by doing the opposite .
The result is elevator music for schizophrenics and those enduring acid flashbacks .
We just listened to the track in full , and it's not bad per se - that is , provided you dig batshit , emotionally jarring music , where children sing about Easter shopping at Walmart .
It also features plenty of oompah horns and bagpipes , so at least it 's multiculturally offensive .
( That 's not even mentioning the Dracula organ dirges , either . )
The world can gather around and hate it together .
Also , you may never think of Yom Kippur the same way ever again .
Nonetheless , it 's funny , too , in a Dadaist way .
This would definitely be a perfect Valentine 's gift for your absurdist boyfriend who did his final U of H art project by donning a meat helmet and officiating a mass pet marriage on Discovery Green .
And we always thought the worst song in the world was whatever Clay Aiken was singing at the moment .
Maddow : ' Are we looking at Bill Clinton 's third term ? '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 7 , 2008
Print This Email This President - elect Obama has fulfilled expectations that he would hit the ground running and has already named the leaders of his transition team and three members of his White House staff .
Some of those appointments come from Obama 's own campaign team , but a larger number have a background of service in the Clinton administration .
MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow was particularly concerned on Thursday with Obama 's selection of Rep. Rahm Emanuel , who worked in the Clinton White House , as his own White House chief of staff .
She noted , " The Emanuel pick has also caused some confusion among those who thought change was n't just a break with the Bush administration but also with the politics of the last 16 years . "
Maddow suggested that there are two interpretations that could be placed on the choice .
One is that Obama is merely looking for experienced " old hands to accomplish his agenda in Washington , " but it could also be that " the politics and policies of ..
Washington in the the 1990s ... come with these guys too . "
Reactions to Obama 's selection of Emanuel have so far tended to focus on the second alternative .
Former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough was incensed on Wednesday , seeing it as a promise of the continuation of partisan politics and a message to Republicans to " drop dead . "
In contrast , an article at the Politico commented that " Although Emanuel is undeniably a partisan fighter , his selection is not an ideological statement .
The Chicago Democrat does not share the reflexively liberal views of many of his House colleagues .
In the Clinton years , he helped pass the North American Free Trade Agreement and pushed for anti-crime and other centrist measures . "
" Are we looking at Bill Clinton 's third term ? "
Maddow asked , as she brought in Steve Benen of the Washington Monthly to " talk me down . "
Benen expressed a skeptical position towards the idea that Obama is deliberately skewing towards Clinton veterans , noting that among Democrats , " almost anyone of a certain age or a certain political background is bound to have spent some time in the Clinton White House or the Clinton administration in some capacity . "
" If we accept that it takes Washington insiders ... to govern effectively from the White House , " Maddow asked , " then should we be scaling back our expectations in terms of how realistic the change message is in the first place ? "
" Obama 's policy agenda has n't changed since his election , " Benen replied .
" Everything that he promised , he 's going to continue to fight for . "
Benen acknowledged that " Emanuel comes from the DLC wing of the party , whereas I think Obama comes from the more progressive wing of the party , and so it 's disconcerting that there 's something of a difference between them . "
However , he reassured Maddow that " Emanuel worked in the Clinton White House .
He understands the role of the White House chief of staff .
I think he's there to help execute an agenda , not necessary to shape the agenda .
...
Emanual probably would n't have taken the job if he was n't prepared to act on what Obama promised to deliver . "
" You have talked me down two - thirds of the way , " Maddow concluded .

Travis the Chimp Attack ( Video )
Travis the chimpanzee
Travis the chimp , best known for his appearances in Coke and Old Navy commercials , was shot and killed on Monday in Stamford , Connecticut , after a vicious attack on 55 - year - old Charla Nash .
The chimpanzee 's owner , Sarah Herold , had called Nash to assist her in getting Travis back in the house after he used a key to let himself out .
Travis jumped on Nash and began biting and mauling her .
Herold called 911 when she was unable to pull the 200 pound chimp off her friend , then grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed her 15 - year - old pet , which she said was " like her child . "
When police arrived , the chimp tried to get into one of the police cruisers , ripping off a side mirror , and trapping an officer inside .
Police shot the animal several times when they were unable to subdue him .
He returned to the house and died inside .
Travis was being treated for Lyme disease , and it is not known whether medications could have played a role in the attack .
He was so agitated earlier in the day that Herold gave him Xanax , an anti-anxiety medication , in some tea .
Nash is currently in the hospital in critical condition .
Two police officers were also injured in the altercation .

Since I have hundreds of maps to choose from , this monthly opportunity will last for years and ultimately become a great way to collect my maps .
Previously I used to point people to my ImageKind Store , but I was n’t pleased with some of the cheap papers the maps were printed on , and have chosen to remove the middle man , so to speak , and have all the map purchases go directly through me .
This way I can control the materials the maps are printed on , personally sign each map , and ensure the quality for each map that is produced .
For the month of August , the first Monthly Map , I chose was Washington Monument Quilt ( above ) , which I first rendered on January 31st , 2006 .
Since the area around the Washington Monument was redacted in the 2005 USGS aerial photography , I felt it was a worthwhile piece to start with .
After sending out my initial e-mail about the offering , I had a friend contact me about purchasing the map and decided to document some of the steps involved in the process of ordering the maps through me ….
Photo of the tube the map is shipped inside of .
Step One – Payment
You can either contact me about sending cash or a check or you can quickly & easily pay the $ 100 by credit card on my PayPal merchant account page .
After I receive the payment , I will need your mailing address if you want the map mailed to you .
If you live in Washington , DC , I can either mail it to you or meet you in person and hand - deliver the map .
I ’ve found it easiest to go through PayPal because it ’s quick and safe .

Step Two – Printing
After I receive payment , I send the map to the printer .
For the time being , my Monthly Map Sale is featuring 30 ″ x 20 ″ prints on Kodak PerfectTouch Paper .
Throughout the last 5 years I ’ve had the best results on this medium , both in quality of colors and durability of the paper .
It ’s also the same medium I used when I donated 8 maps to the Library of Congress in 2006 .
In about 3 days or less , I receive confirmation that the map has been printed and is in transit to me or you .

Step Three – Shipping
I can have the map shipped directly to you as well ( without signature , date , or label ) for faster turnaround or I can have it shipped to my house .
After the map arrives , I remove it from the shipping tube ( above ) , carefully flip it over , label the name of the map , label the date it was originally rendered , label the date it was printed , and sign the map ( below ) .
After this , I roll the map back up into the tube , add a little extra padding to ensure the map will not be damaged , then I bring it to the post office .
Three days later it should be delivered to your mailbox .
Or if the map is purchased locally , we can meet up and exchange the map in person .

THATS IT !
I think the whole process is pretty simple .
In all this process takes about one or two weeks depending on the speed at which the payment is received and how long it takes for the map to be printed and shipped .
I think the hardest part of it all will be choosing which map to offer each month !
Please contact me if you are interested in purchasing this month ’s map or have suggestions for future Monthly Map offerings .

Advertisement Japan 's finance minister is facing calls for him to resign amid claims he was drunk at a recent G7 meeting .
Shoichi Nakagawa has apologised for his behaviour but blamed cold remedies for a slurred performance at a news conference in Rome at the weekend .
He said he had not drunk more than a sip of alcohol before facing the media .
Despite opposition calls for him to quit , Mr Nakagawa said Prime Minister Taro Aso had asked him to stay on in his job and be careful of his health .
The news conference followed a meeting of finance ministers focussing on the current world economic crisis .
It 's embarrassing .
He 's damaged the national interest
Yukio Hatoyama
Democratic Party Secretary General Footage showed Mr Nakagawa slurring his speech and closing his eyes repeatedly as if he was dozing off .
At one point , he mistook a question aimed at the governor of the Bank of Japan as one intended for him .
" It 's embarrassing , " said Democratic Party Secretary General Yukio Hatoyama .
" This has sent a message to the whole world .
He 's damaged the national interest . "
But Mr Nakagawa said it would not affect Japan 's standing or its relations with other G7 members .
Approval ratings
He explained that he had sipped wine at a luncheon toast on the day of the news conference , but had not consumed an entire glass .
He said he had taken too much medicine , including cold remedy , and that had made him drowsy .
Mr Nakagawa has denied reports - including the view of a former prime minister - that he is a regular drinker .
" What I want the most now is to completely recover from my cold , " Mr Nakagawa told reporters .
The controversy comes as Prime Minister Taro Aso is struggling with approval ratings .
The latest opinion poll suggests fewer than 10 % of people support the prime minister , who must call a general election by September .
Japan , the world 's second - biggest economy , has been hard hit by the global downturn ; it is seeing a slowdown that is steeper than that being experienced in the US or Europe .
Official figures show the country 's economy contracted by 3.3 % in the last quarter of last year ; its worst showing since the oil crisis of the 1970s .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The office of New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday it issued subpoenas to former Merrill Lynch Chief Executive Officer John Thain and Bank of America Chief Administrative Officer J. Steele Alphin .
The subpoenas were issued as part of its ongoing inquiry into billions of dollars in bonuses paid by Merrill Lynch just days before Merrill was taken over by Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % .
" The fact that Merrill Lynch appears to have moved up the timetable to pay bonuses before its merger with Bank of America is troubling to say the least and warrants further investigation , " Cuomo said in a statement .
Cuomo also said his office launched a probe into executive compensation practices at other TARP funded institutions in coordination with the TARP Special Inspector General Neil Barofsky .
An assessment of the spread of the refinery wildcat strikes - purportedly over the hiring of foreign workers - and the media coverage of them .
The wave of unofficial walkouts following the use of the Italian construction contractor , IREM with its own workforce at Total 's Lindsey oil refinery have received a great deal of media coverage .
The motive force seems to be the precarious status of skilled work in Britain .
The limited amount available and increased competition for skilled contracts has led to increasing insecurity amongst the workforce .
The use of foreign companies with their own workforces to do the work more cheaply has compounded this .
This is a result of the workings of the economy and not a conflict between nationalities , something that is n’t lost on at least some of those protesting .
The Guardian quoted a picket from the protest in Cardiff , John Cummins , 44 , as saying : " I was laid off as a stevedore two weeks ago .
I 've worked in Cardiff and Barry Docks for 11 years and I 've come here today hoping that we can shake the government up .
I think the whole country should go on strike as we 're losing all British industry .
But I 've got nothing against foreign workers .
I can't blame them for going where the work is . "
It appears that this increasing insecurity for skilled workers is behind the protest , not racism .
We should be wary of the way in which the media reports such disputes .
When workers at a nuclear power station in Plymouth walked out on a wildcat strike last year after a round of layoffs , the media immediately reported that they were walking out over “ foreign workers ” , and that it was a protest against jobs going to cheaper Poles .
This contradicted statements from strikers , and the fact that Polish workers were amongst those who walked out in solidarity .
In that case it was again the unions which were spinning the “ British jobs for British workers ” line .
Django , a libcom user and member of the Anarchist Federation stated :
" The media will always go for the nationalist reasoning .
The strategy that Unite are following is to quote Gordon Brown ’s words from the 2007 Labour Party Conference back at him – that he would defend “ British jobs for British workers ” .
They are arguing in defence of the national interest , and the placards you see at the protests saying this are union ones .
Its clearly part of the strategy for publicising the dispute , an effective one as it chimes with the nationalist sentiments you ’ll find in the media .
It ’s one we are likely to see more of in similar kinds of disputes .
The economy is proving unable to provide the work we need to get by to increasing numbers of skilled workers , and so individual workers are faced with increasing insecurity .
The managers at Lindsay put out the project to tender and took the most cost effective option as a way to protect their profits .
This is what they care about , not providing means of subsistence to working class people .
But nationalism is how this is being rationalised , nationalism of a vaguely left - wing sort – the working class should have work provided for them by the government , they have an obligation to protect us , etc .
This is added to the xenophobia of the media , who otherwise ignore or criticise any strike action .
The Italian and Portuguese workers at the site face unemployment at home as British workers face it here , this the problem is at root an economic one to which nationalism offers no solution , only scapegoats . "
Unfortunately , Troubadour has no cash on hand because he invested it all in high yield mutual funds .

In case you ’ve missed it so far , the countdown to Buttersafe Expo 2009 has begun .
On the forums , pizza enthusiasts have already begun organizing BSX’s in the cities of Portland , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Fredericton , Brisbane , and Buenos Ares , as well as Massachusetts , Ireland , and northern England at large .
If you ’re so inclined , hop on board or try to get a party going in your area !

RSS Hits the Big Time
As chaunceyt pointed out , the new stimulus bill ’s implementation instructions require that each government agency report the money it gives out in RSS :
For each of the near term reporting requirements ( major communications , formula block grant allocations , weekly reports ) agencies are required to provide a feed ( preferred : Atom 1.0 , acceptable : RSS ) of the information so that content can be delivered via subscription .
The document is very clear that the items in the feed ca n’t simply be unstructured text , but have to be reusable data , e.g. :
Formula Block Grant Allocation Reports : Agencies are asked to provide Formula Block Grant Allocation information as soon as it becomes available .
Data elements for the formula block grant allocation feed should include : Data Elements Description Field Type Recipient Name
The name of the recipient of the award . varchar ( 45 ) Federal Funding Amount Amount of federal government ’s obligation or contingent liability , in dollars .
A negative number represents a decrease in funding .
int ( 11 ) Recipient DUNS
Unique nine - digit number issued by Dun & Bradstreet to the agency .
Followed by an optional DUNS Plus 4 which allows an agency to submit different bank account data for a single DUNS ( Assigned by Dun & Bradstreet ) char( 13 ) [… ]
And it goes on like this for several pages .
Pretty amazing to see a government so tech - savvy .

The War on Terror Is a Hoax By Paul Craig Roberts According to US government propaganda , terrorist cells are spread throughout America , making it necessary for the government to spy on all Americans and violate most other constitutional protections .
Among President Bush ’s last words as he left office was the warning that America would soon be struck again by Muslim terrorists .
If America were infected with terrorists , we would not need the government to tell us .
We would know it from events .
As there are no events , the US government substitutes warnings in order to keep alive the fear that causes the public to accept pointless wars , the infringement of civil liberty , national ID cards , and inconveniences and harassments when they fly .
The most obvious indication that there are no terrorist cells is that not a single neocon has been assassinated .
I do not approve of assassinations , and am ashamed of my country ’s government for engaging in political assassination .
The US and Israel have set a very bad example for al Qaeda to follow .
The US deals with al Qaeda and Taliban by assassinating their leaders , and Israel deals with Hamas by assassinating its leaders .
It is reasonable to assume that al Qaeda would deal with the instigators and leaders of America ’s wars in the Middle East in the same way .
Today every al Qaeda member is aware of the complicity of neoconservatives in the death and devastation inflicted on Muslims in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon and Gaza .
Moreover , neocons are highly visible and are soft targets compared to Hamas and Hezbollah leaders .
Neocons have been identified in the media for years , and as everyone knows , multiple listings of their names are available online .
Neocons do not have Secret Service protection .
Dreadful to contemplate , but it would be child ’s play for al Qaeda to assassinate any and every neocon .
Yet , neocons move around freely , a good indication that the US does not have a terrorist problem .
If , as neocons constantly allege , terrorists can smuggle nuclear weapons or dirty bombs into the US with which to wreak havoc upon our cities , terrorists can acquire weapons with which to assassinate any neocon or former government official .
Yet , the neocons , who are the Americans most hated by Muslims , remain unscathed .
The “ war on terror ” is a hoax that fronts for American control of oil pipelines , the profits of the military - security complex , the assault on civil liberty by fomenters of a police state , and Israel ’s territorial expansion .
There were no al Qaeda in Iraq until the Americans brought them there by invading and overthrowing Saddam Hussein , who kept al Qaeda out of Iraq .
The Taliban is not a terrorist organization , but a movement attempting to unify Afghanistan under Muslim law .
The only Americans threatened by the Taliban are the Americans Bush sent to Afghanistan to kill Taliban and to impose a puppet state on the Afghan people .
Hamas is the democratically elected government of Palestine , or what little remains of Palestine after Israel ’s illegal annexations .
Hamas is a terrorist organization in the same sense that the Israeli government and the US government are terrorist organizations .
In an effort to bring Hamas under Israeli hegemony , Israel employs terror bombing and assassinations against Palestinians .
Hamas replies to the Israeli terror with homemade and ineffectual rockets .
Hezbollah represents the Shi’ites of southern Lebanon , another area in the Middle East that Israel seeks for its territorial expansion .
The US brands Hamas and Hezbollah “ terrorist organizations ” for no other reason than the US is on Israel ’s side of the conflict .
There is no objective basis for the US Department of State ’s “ finding ” that Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist organizations .
It is merely a propagandistic declaration .
Americans and Israelis do not call their bombings of civilians terror .
What Americans and Israelis call terror is the response of oppressed people who are stateless because their countries are ruled by puppets loyal to the oppressors .
These people , dispossessed of their own countries , have no State Departments , Defense Departments , seats in the United Nations , or voices in the mainstream media .
They can submit to foreign hegemony or resist by the limited means available to them .
The fact that Israel and the United States carry on endless propaganda to prevent this fundamental truth from being realized indicates that it is Israel and the US that are in the wrong and the Palestinians , Lebanese , Iraqis , and Afghans who are being wronged .
The retired American generals who serve as war propagandists for Fox “ News ” are forever claiming that Iran arms the Iraqi and Afghan insurgents and Hamas .
But where are the arms ?
To deal with American tanks , insurgents have to construct homemade explosive devices out of artillery shells .
After six years of conflict the insurgents still have no weapon against the American helicopter gunships .
Contrast this “ arming ” with the weaponry the US supplied to the Afghans three decades ago when they were fighting to drive out the Soviets .
The films of Israel ’s murderous assault on Gaza show large numbers of Gazans fleeing from Israeli bombs or digging out the dead and maimed , and none of these people are armed .
A person would think that by now every Palestinian would be armed , every man , woman , and child .
Yet , all the films of the Israeli attack show an unarmed population .
Hamas has to construct homemade rockets that are little more than a sign of defiance .
If Hamas were armed by Iran , Israel ’s assault on Gaza would have cost Israel its helicopter gunships , its tanks , and hundreds of lives of its soldiers .
Hamas is a small organization armed with small caliber rifles incapable of penetrating body armor .
Hamas is unable to stop small bands of Israeli settlers from descending on West Bank Palestinian villages , driving out the Palestinians , and appropriating their land .
The great mystery is : why after 60 years of oppression are the Palestinians still an unarmed people ?
Clearly , the Muslim countries are complicit with Israel and the US in keeping the Palestinians unarmed .
The unsupported assertion that Iran supplies sophisticated arms to the Palestinians is like the unsupported assertion that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction .
These assertions are propagandistic justifications for killing Arab civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in order to secure US and Israeli hegemony in the Middle East .

You know about the Miss America and Miss Universe beauty pageants .
You are probably also aware of child beauty pageants , bodybuilding contests , transexual pageants , and pageants for married women .
Then there are the odd beauty pageants .
Last August , an Italian priest proposed an online beauty pageant for nuns .
One day later , he rescinded the idea under pressure from local and religious authorities .
But there are plenty of other beauty pageants that stray far from what you are used to .
Miss Klingon Empire
The Miss Klingon Empire beauty pageant has been held annually for ten years now at the Dragon *con event in Atlanta .
This image of the 2006 winner is from Flickr user elemess .
Also see a video report of the most recent pageant .
Miss Hooker
The Miss Hooker 2008 pageant was what you 'd think - a beauty pageant for prostitutes , but there were no real prostitutes in the running , just actresses putting on a show , arraigned by artist Natalia Fabia .
But what a show !
The eventual winner went by the name Miss One Dolla No Holla .
See more pictures here .
Miss Plastic Surgery
A Miss Plastic Surgery pageant was held in China in 2004 .
It was a one - time - only event , in which all contestants were required to have undergone some type of plastic surgery .
The pageant was launched in reaction to an earlier scandal in which a contestant was disqualified from another beauty contest because she had used cosmetic surgery .
Ms. Pregnant
You do n't have to let a little thing like pregnancy stop you from entering a beauty pageant .
The Ms. Pregnant pageant celebrates beauty with a bump .
And yes , they parade in bikinis !
Miss Subways
A New York advertising agency held a pageant from 1941 to 1976 called Miss Subways .
The winner was featured in ads on trains and stations .
The tradition was revived in 2004 , when Caroline Sanchez - Bernat was crowned Miss Subways .
Zombie Beauty
A Zombie Beauty Contest is held annually at the Phoenix ComiCon .
This year 's pageant was just a couple of weeks ago .
Heather , the winner , is pictured here .
See pictures from last year 's zombie pageant at Flickr .
Most Beautiful Bottom
The Most Beautiful Bottom in the World contest was launched in 2007 by the underwear manufacturer sloggi .
It is open to both men and women , and the winner for each category gets a modeling contract .
See a video of the 2008 competition in Paris .
This photo is from the 2007 contest in Munich .
Miss Landmine
Miss Landmine is a beauty pageant for women disabled by landmines and other war - related injuries held in Angola .
The pageant , created by Norwegian artist Morten Traavik , celebrates pride and empowerment over physical perfection .
Prison Pageants
In the Miss Spring beauty pageant held in a Siberian prison near Novosibirsk , participation can mean freedom , as the parole board takes community activity into account when deciding who to release .
A 2006 film , Miss Gulag is a documentary about the Miss Spring pageant .
Other prison beauty pageants include Miss Captivity , held in a Lithuanian prison , Miss Prisoner held in Bogota , Colombia , and Miss Prisoner in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil .

Miss Jumbo Queen
Thailand hosts the Miss Jumbo Queen pageant for big beautiful women .
The pageant grew out of an elephant conservation project .
The aim of the contest is to select the contestant who best exhibits the characteristics of an elephant , by virtue of her grace , elegance and size , to help promote elephant conservation causes in Thailand .
However , it appears that the last Jumbo Queen was crowned in 2005 .
Harvest Festival Queens
Local harvest festivals have the funniest names for ordinary beauty pageants .
Who could resist putting such gems as Miss Meat Pie , Miss Hell Hole Swamp , or Miss Worm Gruntin ' Queen on their resume ?
Pictured is the Gilroy Garlic Festival queen .
As the trial of a former Khmer Rouge leader opens in Phnom Penh , Cambodians have been queuing to attend the court .
Here people across the country give their reaction to the trial .
SOTHEA THAI , 30 , WEB EDITOR , PHNOM PENH I was born in 1980 after the Khmer Rouge was toppled by Vietnamese troops - I 'm part of the first generation after the regime 's fall .
I think most of Cambodia 's younger generation are eager to know the truth behind what happened .
We want to hear from the killers why they killed people during their rule .
We 're seeking explanations for what went on .
A lot of time has passed so I have never thought about revenge but explanations .
Even in my village people who used to be the men of the Khmer Rouge still live together with the victims .
That is the reality of Cambodia today .
Frankly , my family did not lose anyone during that regime .
So maybe my feeling is different from people who lost their loved ones .
But what is most important to me is a clear explanation of the history of that time .
We can learn from that experience to prevent that type of killing from happening in the future .
I just want truth to to come out of the trial .
PUTHYWONG , 26 , IT WORKER , RATNAKIRI
I want the people who were killed to get what they need .
Their families and descendants are all still here .
The killers need to pay for what they have done to those families .
I think this trial is about punishment .
These people have done very bad things to Cambodia and the Cambodian people .
My grandparents died in that time .
My grandfather was a policeman and when the Khmer Rouge found out about this they murdered him .
Because my father was so young he was spared .
I have visited Tuol Seng , the prison where Duch [ Khmer Rouge defendant ] was the head .
I was very scared by it .
People in Phnom Penh know all about this trial .
We send each other the links , but in the provinces there is not much information .
TUY BUNNARA , PNOMH PENH , 46 I want to see the trial conducted fairly .
But I was alive at that time and many of my family died under the Khmer Rouge .
They killed so many relatives and I remember it all .
I want to see those remaining Khmer Rouge members properly tried and I want to see a Cambodian court punish them .
I trust the trial because I trust that Cambodian courts can judge .
But I do n't have much information about the court and how it works .
I wish I had a bit more .
Also , I really feel that I want an explanation for what happened at that time .

In January , 2004 Apple introduced a new addition to the the iLife software suite , GarageBand .
After a programs for managing music ( iTunes ) , digital pictures ( iPhoto ) , home moviemaking ( iMovie ) and Dvd creation ( iDvd ) with iLife 04 it was the turn of a solution that turned a Mac into a professional - quality musical instrument and recording studio thanks to technologies from German software - house Emagic , which Apple acquired in 2002 .
Using Apple ’s promotional images for media let ’s see how GarageBand has evolved in its first five years ( and five versions ) although , as you can see the official screenshots in the last year stray away from showing the main interface and put the spotlight on specific features that Apple wanted to showcase and promote .
GarageBand ( iLife 04 ) : it ’s clear how GarageBand belongs to the Logic lineage and the lower section with samples and instruments also resembles Soundtrack , introduced in 2003 .
GarageBand 2 ( iLife 05 ) : the main new feature spotlighted here is that the program now “ displays and edits musical notation in real time for people who know how to read and write music or want to learn ” .
GarageBand 3 ( iLife 06 ) : the new sidebar and the lower area make it pretty much evident that GarageBand is also “ a complete solution for creating professional quality Podcasts ” .
GarageBand 08 ( iLife 08 ) : there are many improvements but Apple chooses to focus on Magic GarageBand , “ an easy and fun way for musicians and non-musicians alike to create a song .
Users can pick from nine musical genres and interact with a band of “ players ” on a virtual stage ” .
GarageBand 09 ( iLife 09 ) : Apple transforms GarageBand into a music teaching tool and a lesson marketplace “ with 18 basic lessons ” for free and “ optional lessons from top artists ” for sale through the GarageBand Lesson Store .

New York : Swimming In Foreclosures
Category Rss Feed - http://www.realestateproarticles.com/rss.php?rss=265
By : Leticia Carvalho
New York foreclosures are starting to be an issue .
An example is the housing situation in Broome County , where 173 foreclosures were already filed from July up to September .
For every 514 properties in the area , one home was being repossessed .
For 2008 , an estimate of more than 50,000 people who own a property in the state of New York filed for foreclosure , specifically in Mid-Hudson Valley and in the western part of the state .
According to Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli , the increase in New York foreclosures can be a threat to state governments as the revenue comes from the 44 percent of tax properties .
DiNapoli indeed made sense because a property tax may increase if foreclosures in the state go higher .
Mayor Matthew T. Ryan said that 39 percent from tax properties will be accountable for Binghamton City�s estimated income for 2009 .
New York is 36th in terms of foreclosures , particularly in the Mid-Hudson Valley , some parts of Southern Tier and Finger Lakes a year ago .
Binghamton City is planning to increase 14 percent in tax property by 2009 , which is 90 percent more than what was allowed by the Constitution .
Ryan is hoping that the government will do something about it .
In every 423 properties in Finger Lakes , one home is being filed as foreclosed in 2008 .
One out of 514 properties in Broome County , and one out of 319 houses in Dutchess County .
Orange County ranked as the highest in foreclosures as one home was filed as foreclosed for every 205 properties .
For 2008 , majority in foreclosure filings came from six counties in upstate New York because of the number of mortgages considered as sub prime .
A decrease of 31 percent in property sales from January to June of last year in New York City was considered very significant .
Mid-Hudson ranked second with 28 percent .
Reports said that the properties are reasonably priced in the upstate area and majority are standard homes in place of luxurious homes due to foreclosures .
Leticia Carvalho has been educated in the finer points of the foreclosure market over 5 years .
In 1961 , the British scientist and physician Alex Comfort wrote a novel ( his fifth ) called “ Come Out to Play , ” in which his alter ego , Dr. George Goggins , opens a clinic with his girlfriend to teach patients advanced sexual techniques .
There he develops a compound called 3 - blindmycin , which has the power to turn people on : “ not raise the libido , ” Comfort later told a journalist , “ but thaw the superego , the part of the mind that says ‘ must n’t . ’ ” In a climactic scene , an explosion releases a cloud of 3 - blindmycin over Buckingham Palace , leaving throngs of uninhibited Englishmen in its wake .
Years afterward , Comfort said he ’d always hoped that Peter Sellers would play him if the book were made into a film ; for his leading lady , he pictured Sophia Loren .
Hollywood seems not to have been interested in the story .
But if someone were to make a bio-pic of Comfort ’s own life it might well feature a scene intercutting that aphrodisiacal cloud with images from Comfort ’s most famous book , the 1972 best - seller “ The Joy of Sex . ”
That , too , was a kind of explosion , intended to unleash its readers ’ sexual potential by counteracting their ignorance and shame .
“ The Joy of Sex , ” which has sold more than twelve million copies worldwide , was an “ unanxious account of the full repertoire of human heterosexuality , ” according to its author .
It was the English answer to Japanese pillow books , illustrated texts designed to show couples where to put what , and was further enhanced by helpful advice : for instance , “ Never , never refer to pillow - talk in anger later on ( ‘ I always knew you were a lesbian , ’ etc. ) . ”
With its discreet cover and its content divided into Starters , Main Courses , and Sauces & Pickles , the book was loosely modelled on “ Joy of Cooking , ” the culinary how - to book that had transformed the way its readers thought about food .
Comfort wanted to do the same thing with making love — help people gain a sense of proficiency with the subject matter , and ultimately render them capable of “ Cordon Bleu sex . ”
But people had never been ashamed to cook .
“ The Joy of Sex ” was something new .
Unbridled eroticism “ could well be the major contribution of the Aquarian revolution to human happiness , ” Comfort wrote .
He cautioned that people who failed to come to terms with an aggressive sexuality were “ apt to end up at My Lai or Belsen . ”
Comfort ’s fellow - Britons were already familiar with his immoderate style of self - expression and his utopian thinking when “ The Joy of Sex ” appeared .
Comfort often aired his “ anarcho - pacifist ” views on the BBC , and he had published several political polemics , in addition to his novels , books of poetry , and what was at the time the preëminent textbook on gerontology .
Comfort was brilliant and multitalented , but there was a certain pat , self - satisfied idealism to much of his nonscientific work .
In 1941 , George Orwell wrote an eviscerating review of Comfort ’s novel “ No Such Liberty , ” deploring “ the argument which is implied all the way through , and sometimes explicitly stated , that there is next to no difference between Britain and Germany , political persecution is as bad in one as in the other , those who fight against the Nazis always go Nazi themselves . ”
Orwell noted , “ If I treat Mr. Comfort ’s novel as a tract , I am only doing what he himself has done already . ”
Comfort had a tendency to focus single - mindedly on a given notion or project at the expense of any kind of balance : while he was a student at Highgate School , in London , he became convinced that he could concoct a superior version of gunpowder .
He blew off much of his left hand .
By the time he was finished with his experiments , his thumb was the only remaining digit .
Later in his life , when he was practicing medicine , he said that he found this claw he ’d created “ very useful for performing uterine inversions . ”
After he entered Trinity College , Cambridge , his enthusiasms led him to accumulate six degrees , including a doctorate in biochemistry .
Comfort turned his attention to sexual liberation with a similar zeal .
He offered readers a creation myth for “ The Joy of Sex ” on the first page , claiming that the book was based on a manuscript that an anonymous and particularly sexually advanced couple had presented to him in his capacity as a biologist .
“ I have done little to the original draft apart from expansion to cover more topics , ” Comfort wrote .
“ The authors ’ choice of emphases and their light - hearted style have been left alone . ”
In fact , both the choice of emphases and the lighthearted style were Comfort ’s ; he wrote every word of “ The Joy of Sex , ” though his credit on the book says “ edited by . ”
Comfort later claimed that he had made up this randy authorial couple because in England at the time it was frowned upon for physicians to write mass - market books , “ an implementation of the principle that doctors do n’t advertise — of which I thoroughly approve , by the way , ” he remarked to a journalist in 1974 .
But it was also probably a subterfuge , to protect the feelings of his wife of thirty years , Ruth Harris .
For more than a decade , Comfort had been sleeping with Ruth ’s best friend , Jane Henderson .
( Comfort met both women at Cambridge . )
Comfort and Henderson took dozens of Polaroids of their erotic experiments , which they gave to the publisher Mitchell Beazley along with Comfort ’s manuscript — originally titled “ Doing Sex Properly . ”
The artists Charles Raymond and Christopher Foss were charged with transforming those photographs into pencil drawings , although the couple they depicted looked nothing like Comfort and Henderson .
If you are a child of the seventies and were raised on “ The Joy of Sex , ” you are not likely to have forgotten the illustrations .
The woman depicted in these drawings is lovely , and , even nearly forty years later , quite chic .
Her gentleman friend , however , looks like a werewolf with a hangover .
He is heavily bearded ; his hair is long , and , it always seemed , a little greasy .
His eyelids are usually at half - mast , adding to his feral appearance .
In some of the pictures , you can practically smell him .
( The smell is unpleasant . )
It is n’t easy watching beauty get pawed by the beast , and our narrator does not help matters .
“ At a certain level and for all men , ” Comfort informs us , “ girls , and parts of girls , are at this stimulus level unpeople . ”
In “ The Joy of Sex , ” a male is a man , a female is a girl , and a vagina is , to “ males generally , slightly scarey : it looks like a castrating wound and bleeds regularly , it swallows the penis and regurgitates it limp , it can probably bite and so on . ”
Men can get past such fears , of what Freudians called the vagina dentata , but Comfort cautions that “ they are the origins of most male hangups including homosexuality . ”
The penis , by contrast , “ has more symbolic importance than any other human organ . ”
Lest there be any confusion : “ Vibrators are no substitute for a penis . ”
Comfort even enlists his fictional female narrator to argue the point for him .
Under the heading “ Women ( by her for him ) , ” Comfort writes of male genitalia , “ It ’s less the size than the personality , unpredictable movements , and moods which make up the turn - on ( which is why rubber dummies are so sickening ) . ”
At times , “ The Joy of Sex ” has the feel of a penis propaganda pamphlet .
There was not a lot of feminist outcry about the book when it was published , probably because in 1972 there was so much else for feminists to cry about .
There was , however , a feminist alternative : the Boston Women ’s Health Book Collective ’s “ Our Bodies , Ourselves . ”
The book announced on its original , 1971 jacket that it was “ By and for Women , ” and with its democratic inclusion of numerous voices it had the vibe of a consciousness - raising group .
( In fact , it was the product of one . )
“ Our Bodies , Ourselves ” covered much of the same material as “ The Joy of Sex , ” just with a different tone .
It , too , had illustrations of a hirsute couple having intercourse in a series of positions .
Both books said that everybody was bisexual , that sex should be a mutually satisfying , full - body experience , and that the communication of turn - ons could be of great benefit to this enterprise .
And both books espoused the ( distinctly seventies ) notion that sex could be a value - neutral experience , as natural as eating , which undermined the traditional belief that sex ought to be in the service of procreation within the bounds of matrimony .
“ Our Bodies , Ourselves ” added information on health , nutrition , self - defense , childbearing , and a rather more involved section on lesbianism .
( “ The Joy of Sex ” has a drawing of two naked ladies kissing under the heading “ Bisexuality , ” while “ Our Bodies , Ourselves ” includes a chapter entitled “ In Amerika They Call Us Dykes . ” )
If “ The Joy of Sex ” was like “ Joy of Cooking ” — though in some ways it was closer to Julia Child ’s “ Mastering the Art of French Cooking , ” what with its strong authorial voice and affection for elaborate undertakings , to which Comfort assigned French names like pattes d’araignée , cuissade , and feuille de rose — “ Our Bodies , Ourselves ” was like the “ Moosewood Cookbook . ”
Everything in it was healthful , enlightened , nourishing .
Here ’s a trick you might try at home sometime : pick almost any recipe in the “ Moosewood . ”
Now add bacon .
You will find that the addition of this decidedly unwholesome ingredient makes the food taste much better .
“ Our Bodies , Ourselves , ” likewise , lacked a certain trayf allure .
The revised edition of the book — even the original — is a fantastic resource for educating young women ( and very sophisticated girls ) about their physicality .
But as an erotic reference for adults in 2008 it ’s a little vegan .
Of course , there are endless alternatives now .
If you are young and sassy , for example , you might enjoy “ Sex : How to Do Everything , ” by two women who call themselves Em & Lo and have a penchant for frisky wordplay .
A character in John Updike ’s “ The Witches of Eastwick ” thinks that “ marriage is like two people locked up with one lesson to read , over and over , until the words become madness . ”
If this rings true to you , you might be interested in “ The Best - Ever Sex Handbook : Successful Techniques and New Ideas for Long - Term Lovers . ”
If you are Wiccan , there ’s “ Wicked Voodoo Sex , ” in which the author , Kathleen Charlotte , promises to help you reclaim your “ wanga . ”
But none of those books have been huge best - sellers or cultural touchstones in the way that “ The Joy of Sex ” and “ Our Bodies , Ourselves ” were .
Partly , this is because “ Joy ” and “ Our Bodies ” were a part of a movement that radically reformed the way the English - speaking world conceives of sexuality .
At this point , only on Opposite Day is sex under - publicized in America .
And there is also the matter of the World Wide Web .
As the puppets in the Broadway musical “ Avenue Q ” sing , “ The Internet is for porn . ”
Of course , the Internet is for everything , but it ’s particularly good for quick answers :
When was the Ming period ?
How do you prepare a truly fluffy frittata ?
And what is “ The Flying Camel ” ?
Into the mobbed marketplace of how - to books and limitless Googling , Crown is releasing a new edition of “ The Joy of Sex ” ( $ 29.95 ) .
Comfort himself revised his book several times ; now Susan Quilliam , a British “ relationship psychologist and agony aunt ” ( as her Web site describes her ) , has endeavored to modernize the text for a new , post - feminist era .
Gone are some of the most outrageous Comfortisms , such as “ Do n’t get yourself raped , ” or his dubious assessment of the rhythm method —
“ It may well account for the slightly higher incidence of abnormal babies among Catholic users through stale eggs getting fertilized . ”
Deodorant is no longer “ banned absolutely , ” as it was by Comfort , and armpit shaving is not referred to as “ ignorant vandalism . ”
Finally , and crucially , rear - entry intercourse is no longer called sex “ à la Négresse . ”
Quilliam has succeeded in bringing “ The Joy of Sex ” up to current standards .
Instead of opening with a crack about “ one - legged ladies , ” as Comfort did , Quilliam adds a well - written section on special considerations for disabled readers , which is sensitive without being condescending .
The book is still emphatically straight , but Quilliam has given it a gay - positive tone , in sharp contrast to Comfort ’s advice that if you might be that way inclined it was better not to experiment too much with a partner of the same sex , lest you let the gay genie out of the bottle .
The original drawings have been replaced , with a mixture of modest photographs and impressionistic sketches .
The hairiness has been eliminated , and the attractiveness gap between the man and the woman has been bridged .
But the people in these pictures do not look as if they were in any kind of sexual ecstasy .
Rather , they have the smug smiles of a couple whose 401 ( k ) s have just appreciated .
They look as if they were in a Viagra commercial , which is to say that they look like two people who have never , ever had sex .
Once you remove those memorable drawings and Comfort ’s batty , phallocentric prose , what you are left with is something that bears little resemblance to the subversive , explosive original .
“ The Joy of Sex ” redux becomes generic — Cook ’s Illustrated with boobies .
What was revolutionary in 1972 seems obvious now , and to present the material otherwise feels silly and square .
It is difficult , for example , to take seriously the claim made by the new “ Joy ” that anal sex is “ one of the last taboos , ” when it was listed as fair game in Comfort ’s text nearly forty years ago — and appears in both the Kamasutra ( of the third century ) and the Chinese “ Rou Pu Tuan , ” from the Ming period ( 1368 - 1644 ; I Googled it ) .
Quilliam hews to Comfort ’s basic premise that too much weirdness in sex is just as bad as too little , and the new edition retains Comfort ’s assertion that “ exclusive obsessions in sex are very like living exclusively on horseradish sauce through allergy to beef ; fear of horseradish sauce , however , as indigestible , unnecessary , and immature , is another hangup , namely puritanism . ”
But , if procreation is no longer the goal of sex , why is one erotic practice more nutritious than the next ?
Who gets to decide what is horseradish and what is beef ?
One is reminded of a line in Comfort ’s poem “ Notes for My Son , ” in which he says , “ Remember when you hear them beginning to say Freedom / Look carefully — see who it is . ”
Comfort ’s freethinking did not extend beyond the boundaries of his own inclinations , and he said as much in his text .
“ We have tried to stay wide open , but it is always difficult to write about things one does n’t enjoy , and we have left out long discussion of the very specialized sexual attitudes . . . which are n’t really love or even sex in quite our sense of the word . ”
Comfort and his wife , Ruth , divorced shortly after “ Joy ” came out : the unpleasantness of his infidelity seems to have been heightened for Mrs.
Comfort when her husband became internationally known as “ Dr. Sex . ”
In 1973 , a few months later , Comfort married his mistress and muse , Jane , and the two moved to Santa Barbara so that Comfort could assume a post at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions , a liberal think tank .
The move also gave them closer proximity to the Sandstone , a clothing - optional community of utopian swingers in Topanga Canyon , which was reportedly visited by Timothy Leary , Sammy Davis , Jr. , Betty Dodson , and the porn star Marilyn Chambers , and which Comfort and Jane had frequented since 1970 .
“ Often the nude biologist Dr. Alex Comfort , brandishing a cigar , traipsed through the room between the prone bodies with the professional air of a lepidopterist strolling through the fields waving a butterfly net , ” Gay Talese wrote in “ Thy Neighbor ’s Wife . ”
But Jane , according to a friend who was interviewed by the journalist Pagan Kennedy , eventually tired of group sex and open marriage .
( Sexual fads may come and go , but jealousy is forever . )
At the same time , Comfort ’s relationship with the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions soured , and he became involved in lawsuits with the center over breach of contract .
In 1985 , Comfort and Henderson returned to England , where he lived the rest of his life , more or less monogamously , in Kent .
Comfort suffered a massive brain hemorrhage in 1991 , at the age of seventy - one , and Jane died shortly thereafter .
From then until Comfort ’s death , in 2000 , his son from his first marriage , Nicholas , was Comfort ’s caretaker and took over the business of managing “ The Joy of Sex . ”
“ He was good about talking about sex in the abstract , but when he had to tell me about the facts of life he was embarrassed , ” Nicholas Comfort told a reporter on the occasion of the book ’s thirtieth anniversary .
“ He got it all over with quite quickly and hoped I would n’t ask any questions . ” ♦
He saw eight presidential administrations come and go , often working six days a week .
" I never missed a day of work , " he says .
His is a story from the back pages of history .
A figure in the tiniest of print ; the man in the kitchen .
He was there while America 's racial history was being remade : the Little Rock school crisis , the 1963 March on Washington , the cities burning , the civil rights bills , the assassinations .
When he started at the White House in 1952 , he could n't even use the public restrooms when he ventured back to his native Virginia .
" We had never had anything , " Mr Allen , 89 , recalls of black America at the time .
" I was always hoping things would get better . "
In its long history , the White House  just note the name  has had a complex and vexing relationship with black Americans .
" The history is not so uneven at the lower level , in the kitchen , " says Ted Sorensen , who served as counsellor to President Kennedy .
" In the kitchen , the folks have always been black .
Even the folks at the door  black . "
Mr Sorensen tried to address the matter of African - Americans in the White House , but in the end , there was only one black man who stayed on the executive staff at the Kennedy White House past the first year .
" There just were n't as many blacks as there should have been , " says Mr Sorensen .
" Sensitivities were n't what they should have been , or could have been . "
In the mid-1950s invitations to the White House were still fraught with racial subtext .
When the Daughters of the American Revolution refused to allow pianist Hazel Scott to perform at Constitution Hall because of her race , many letters poured into the White House decrying the DAR 's position .
First lady Bess Truman was a member of the organisation , but made no effort to get the DAR to alter its policy .
The first black to hold a policy or political position in the White House was E. Frederick Morrow , a former public relations executive with CBS .
Dwight Eisenhower 's presidential campaign operatives were so impressed with Mr Morrow 's diligent work during the 1952 campaign that they promised him a White House executive job if Ike were elected .
Ike won , but Mr Morrow ended up being placed at the Department of Commerce .
He felt slighted and appealed to Republican friends in New York to force the White House to make good on its promise .
Before he landed his job at the White House , Mr Allen worked as a waiter at a resort in Virginia , and then at a country club in Washington .
He and Helene , 86 , are sitting in their living room .
A cane rests across Helene 's lap .
Her voice is musical , in a Lena Horne kind of way .
They met in Washington at a birthday party in 1942 .
He was too shy to ask for her number , so she tracked his down .
They married a year later .
In 1952 , a lady told Mr Allen of a job opening in the White House .
" I was n't even looking for a job , " he says .
" I was happy where I was , but she told me to go on over there and meet with a guy by the name of Alonzo Fields . "
Mr Fields was a maitre d' , and he immediately liked Allen .
He was offered a job as a " pantry man " .
He washed dishes , stocked cabinets and shined silverware .
He started at $ US2400 a year .
There was , in time , a promotion to butler .
" Shook the hand of all the presidents I ever worked for , " he says .
" I was there , honey , " Helene reminds him .
" In the back maybe .
But I shook their hands , too . "
She 's referring to White House holiday parties .
They have one son , Charles , who works as an investigator with the State Department .
" President Ford 's birthday and my birthday were on the same day , " says Mr Allen .
" He 'd have a birthday party at the White House .
Everybody would be there .
And Mrs Ford would say , ' It 's Gene 's birthday , too . ' "
And so they would sing a little ditty to the butler .
And the butler , who wore a tuxedo to work every day , would blush .
" Jack Kennedy was very nice , " he says .
" And so was Mrs Kennedy . "
He was in the White House kitchen the day JFK was slain .
He got a personal invitation to the funeral , but volunteered for other duty : " Somebody had to be at the White House to serve everyone after they came from the funeral . "
The whole family of President Jimmy Carter made Mrs Allen chuckle : " They were country .
And I 'm talking Lillian and Rosalynn both . "
It comes out sounding like the highest compliment .
First lady Nancy Reagan came looking for him in the kitchen one day .
She wanted to remind him about the upcoming state dinner for then German chancellor Helmut Kohl .
He told her he was well ahead in the planning and had already picked out the china .
But she told him he would not be working that night .
" She said , ' You and Helene are coming to the state dinner as guests of President Reagan and myself . '
I 'm telling you !
I believe I 'm the only butler to get invited to a state dinner . "
President Kennedy started with two African - Americans , Frank Reeves and Andrew Hatcher , in executive positions on his White House staff .
Only Mr Hatcher , a deputy press secretary , remained after six months .
Mr Reeves , who focused on civil rights matters , left in a reshuffle .
Lyndon Johnson devoted considerable energy and determination to civil rights legislation , even appointing the first African - American to the Supreme Court .
But it did not translate to any appreciable number of black staff working for him .
Colin Powell would become the highest - ranking African - American of any White House to that point when he was named President Reagan 's national security adviser in 1987 .
Condoleezza Rice would have that same position under President George W. Bush .
The butler remembers seeing Mr Powell and Dr Rice in the Oval Office .
He was serving refreshments .
He could n't help notice that black people were moving closer to the centre of power , closer than he could ever have dreamed .
He would tell Helene how proud it made him feel .
Mr Allen was promoted to maitre d' in 1980 .
He left the White House in 1986 , after 34 years .
President Reagan wrote him a sweet note ; Nancy Reagan hugged him .
Interviewed at their home last week , Mr and Mrs Allen speculated about what it would mean if a black man were elected president .
" It 'd be really something , " said Mr Allen .
" We 're pretty much past the going - out stage , " his wife said .
" But you never know .
If he gets in there , it 'd sure be nice to go over there again . "
Mr Allen has pictures of every president he served on a wall in his basement .
There 's a painting President Eisenhower gave him and a picture of President Ford opening birthday gifts , Mr Allen hovering nearby .
They talked about praying to help Barack Obama get to the White House .
They would go vote together .
On Monday , Mrs Allen had a doctor 's appointment .
Mr Allen woke and nudged her once , then again .
He shuffled around to her side of the bed .
He nudged his wife again .
He was all alone .
" I woke up and my wife did n't , " he said later .
Some friends and family members rushed over .
He wanted to make coffee .
They had to shoo the butler out of the kitchen .
The lady he married 65 years ago will be buried today .

The butler cast his vote for Obama on Tuesday .
He so missed telling his Helene about the black man bound for the Oval Office .
WASHINGTON POST
The Seattle Post - Intelligencer is reporting that Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske will likely be Obama ’s nominee for director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , commonly referred to as the drug czar .
It appears that we may soon be faced with the most promising drug czar ever to occupy the position .
To be clear , Kerlikowske is not a friend of drug policy reform to any extent I ’m aware of .
What matters here is that I see no evidence that he is a vicious drug warrior of the sort commonly associated with the drug czar post .
Given that ONDCP is mandated to oppose reform efforts and has typically embraced that role , a less confrontational and reefer madness - driven drug czar is really the best case scenario from a drug policy reform perspective .
Under Kerlikowske , Seattle has been a model for sensible marijuana policy , including the famous Seattle Hempfest at which the Seattle Police Department performs a public safety role while declining to make marijuana arrests .
Following the passage of a 2004 lowest priority initiative , the city ’s already - low rate of marijuana prosecutions fell even further , suggesting that Kerlikowske was responsive to the will of voters .
In that sense , he offers a dramatic departure from ONDCP ’s shameful history of undermining state medical marijuana laws and inserting itself into state politics for the purpose of thwarting reform efforts .
In an office typically run by military officials and political hacks , Kerlikowske would bring expertise in community policing and public relations .
As drug czar , I have no doubt that Gil Kerlikowske would oppose drug legalization and serve as our primary opponent on many issues .
Nevertheless , at first glance , my gut instinct is that after several drug czars from hell , a guy from Seattle does n’t sound so bad .
Update : I 'd be remiss not to mention that Kerlikowske 's immediate predecessor was Norm Stamper .
Today is my last day as site lead at Lifehacker , so I 'm taking off my distanced reporter hat to get all mushy , personal , and behind - the - scenes on you .
Come in and grab a seat .

You 've been warned ! )
The idea to do Lifehacker hatched back in late 2004 , a riff on the notion of " life hacks " that technologist Danny O'Brien cooked up earlier that year .
Starting a web site about life hacks was n't an original undertaking ; Merlin Mann 's 43 Folders was first .
In fact , without Danny and Merlin , Lifehacker would have never happened .
I owe both of these guys a huge debt of gratitude for their articulation of a concept that I literally launched a writing career upon .

But back to late 2004 .

Throughout November and December , my colleagues at Gawker Media and I designed the personality behind Lifehacker , the person who would become the site 's mascot .
It would be a " she , " of course , because I am .
The female take on tech would define the voice of the site , but subtly , without any pink " you go girl " crap — just straight talk from someone helpful and knowledgeable but not pandering , someone focused not on the shiny but on the useful , someone brisk and futuristic .
We imagined her as a spaceship flight attendant or pilot of sorts .
( One of the first sketches of that early conception of our gal is on the right . )
Our design team created the final Lifehacker mascot based on this persona .
" What color should the site theme be ? " our designers asked .
I 'd just read a book called Opening the Xbox , which described how Microsoft developed the popular console , including their color choices .
" Green , " I said .
" People associate it with technology . "
On January 31st of 2005 the site went public .
My starting posts were stiff , mostly because I was nervous and scared .
I 'd been blogging since 2001 , but my personal site got about 10 hits on a big day , and five of those would be from my brother .
Having all the eyes that a Gawker blog launch drew on me was terrifying .
That day , out of necessity , I started growing the thick skin anyone who has any exposure on the intertubes requires to stay sane .
( In the beginning , that growth process did n't happen as quickly as I needed , and a troll could ruin my weekend .
Today , I can chuckle in the face of the worst kind of online name - calling you can imagine . )

For the first eight months of Lifehacker 's existence , there was no way for readers to comment on posts .
I pumped out a dozen posts per weekday on my own .
I personally responded to every single message in the mounting pile of email that accumulated in our inbox .
No matter how many productivity tricks I used , that just did n't scale .
When we finally brought on three more bloggers to join me that fall , Lifehacker shifted from being less of a solo blog and more of a magazine with an editorial staff .
We turned on approval - only comments that October , and that 's when the real fun began .

Here 's what Lifehacker looked like back then .
( Click to enlarge . )
My initial plan was to try this crazy " pro blogger thing " out for a year and then go back to being a web developer .
But I fell in love with the brand , our readership , and my co-bloggers .
I was high on that transcendent , effortless momentum that comes with work you love so much it feels like play , and it zipped me past the one , two , and three year marks .
Four years and 20,000 posts later , I 'm still pinching myself about the opportunities this place opened up for me .

Because of Lifehacker , I 've published two editions of a best - selling tech book , which has been translated into two languages .
I 've been written about in books and magazines , and I 've written for magazines and contributed to others ' books .
I released a series of Firefox extensions , one of which made it onto Mozilla 's official recommended add - on list .
I 've done radio and newspaper interviews and TV appearances , spoken at conferences around the world , visited the campuses of Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft , been asked for my autograph , gotten awards , been recognized by some of my idols , met some of the the smartest minds in tech , and built up an online audience of over one million unique daily readers .

For someone with no prior professional writing experience , that 's just nuts .
Behold the power of the internet .

It was n't always an easy road , though .
I learned many lessons the hard way , like how to handle irate netizens and how to extract the constructive bits out of painful criticism .
I learned how much room for improvement there really is for me in the reading and writing department .
I got schooled , publicly , by people smarter and more experienced .
Those days were rough .
There were tears .
In my worst moments of self - doubt , I felt like I was in way over my head , that I was a fraud .
I learned a whole lot about my strengths , and a whole lot more about my shortcomings .
I was always comfortable pushing 1's and 0's around , but managing a staff of humans who were spread across the country was a huge challenge .
( To all the bloggers , interns , and copy editors who have worked for me : thanks for putting up with my flailings . )
Still , on most days , I was having a ball .

During my tenure as site lead , Lifehacker started at 0 and grew to 33 million pageviews a month .
Like most web sites , we measure our performance by our traffic charts .
But that 's not the true indicator of Lifehacker 's success .
What I 'm most proud of at this site is the high level of goodwill and useful knowledge that passes between the people who read and write here .
We editors have always tried to be positive and helpful to set an example for readers .
It worked .
Compare any comment thread at Lifehacker to a similar one at any other tech site , and you 'll see the difference is the knowledge and the generosity of most of the discourse .
It 's the conversations that make Lifehacker magical .
While lots of web site editorial tears stuff to pieces , my goal with Lifehacker was to help our readers out , make their day a little easier .
We did n't hit the mark on every post , but we were always trying .
As the years passed , Lifehacker became my online alter ego , my professional identity , my work and my play .
I happily gave up time I 'd normally spend on creative side projects to the site , because it was my primary outlet for the two things I love most : software and writing .
But as our staff and audience grew , the news chase intensified , and management duties piled up .
I started writing and coding less and air traffic - controlling , copy - editing , budgeting , doing PR , and assigning stories to my writers more .
While that all has been great experience I am lucky to have under my belt , it 's time for me to recalibrate how I 'm spending my days .
As someone put well , it 's time to mitigate the urgent to focus on the important .

The bottom line is this : for someone who loves making things on the web , spending 100 % of the time blogging about what other people are making is simply untenable .
So as of today , Adam is Lifehacker 's new lead editor .
He 's going to do a kickass job .
I 'm not riding off into the sunset never to be seen again , either .
While Adam will be running the show on a daily , I get to go back to making things , noodling with software , and writing about it .
After I take a couple of weeks off , I 'll be back here in February publishing a weekly feature series that will detail my latest coding projects , productivity revelations , and favorite life hacks and software tricks .
I can not wait .

But before I start my morph from daily lead editor to weekly feature writer , I wanted to say thank you .
Thank you for reading this .
Thank you for making Lifehacker such a special place .
Thank you for giving me the coolest job on the internet .
Thank you for putting up with our growing pains and missteps .
I 've loved reading and writing every word here , and I 'll always feel so lucky to have been part of Lifehacker 's beginnings .
Having your time and attention has always been , and continues to be , a privilege and an honor .

One reason racism persists is that many people imagine they would respond strongly to a racist act but actually respond with indifference , a new study led by York University shows .
The research examines why acts of blatant racism against blacks still occur with alarming regularity , even though being labeled as a racist in modern society has become a powerful stigma .
" People do not think of themselves as prejudiced , and they predict that they would be very upset by a racist act and would take action , " said lead author Kerry Kawakami , a psychology professor in York 's Faculty of Health .
" However , we found that their responses are much more muted than they expect when they are actually faced with an overtly racist comment . "
Kawakami led the study at York with graduate student Francine Karmali .
University of British Columbia professor Elizabeth Dunn , an expert on people 's ability to predict their future emotional responses , and Yale University professor John Dovidio , an expert on prejudice , are co-authors .
In the study , students who think they are waiting for an experiment to begin are exposed to racism .
Specifically , a white confederate makes a racist comment about a black confederate when he briefly leaves the room .
When he returns , the actual participant is asked to choose a partner to work with on a subsequent exercise .
The researchers studied 120 non -black participants who volunteered for the experiment and either directly experienced a racial incident or had the incident described to them .
The first group watched a black man , posing as a fellow participant , slightly bump a white confederate also posing as a participant .
After the black man left the room , the white confederate either said nothing , or " I hate it when black people do that , " or said , " clumsy n____ . "
Other groups did not directly experience the event but either read about it or watched it on videotape and were asked to predict their responses to the events .

The subjects who did n't experience the event were much more likely to report that they were upset at the white worker 's slurs and to say they would not work with such a person .
Those who actually experienced the event were less distressed and were as willing to work with the person who made racist comments as someone who did not .
Dovidio argues that participants who witness racism were much less willing to pay the emotional cost of confronting a racist than they thought they would be .
That in turn means the racist pays less of a cost in social ostracism by expressing bias , he said .
" What we found was that students were more likely to choose the white confederate as a partner ( 63 per cent ) , despite the fact that the white person had made a racist comment about the black person , " said Kawakami .
" And the racist comments ranged from moderate to one of the most powerful anti-black slurs in the English language . "
The findings may seem surprising at a time when America is about to inaugurate its first black president , but the election of one black man does not mean that racism is dead or that people will no longer tolerate acts of racism , Kawakami said .
Notably , there has been little research done on how people respond to prejudice toward others .
However , University of British Columbia professor Elizabeth Dunn , one of the authors of the Science article , studies people 's ability to predict their own affective and behavioural reactions .
" People often make inaccurate forecasts about how they would respond emotionally to negative events .
They vastly overestimate how upset they would feel in bad situations such as hearing a racial slur , " said Dunn .
" One of the ways that people may stem the tide of negative emotions related to witnessing a racial slur is to re-construe the comment as a joke or as a harmless remark . "
Further studies currently being conducted by these researchers are investigating how characteristics related to the racists and the target of prejudice increases or decreases emotional , behavioral , and physiological reactions to racial slurs .
Examining people 's perceptions of both the white and black confederate may provide important clues as to when people do and do not stand up against racism .
I ’m not ashamed of those sins any more , so here you go :)
1. ORM
Stupidity Building my own Object Relational Mapping framework .
Consequence Project is a mess after 2 years of maintenance with hardcore hacks to bypass my own ORM and call custom SQL queries .
What should I have done Use hibernate , iBATIS , Cayenne or something similar .
2. EAV
Stupidity Using an Entity - Attribute - Value model database schema design .
Consequence Non scalable solution and total impossibility to run any useful queries on the database level .
What should I have done Use an ordinary normalized database schema design .
3. Database Access
Stupidity Synchronize ( serialize ) database access using one shared connection .
Consequence Zero scalability .
Very slow response times when more than 10 users where using the application .
What should I have done Do n’t do that and use a connection pool such as c3p0 and use a “ new ” ( reused ) connection returned from the pool for every request / response cycle .
4. IDE
Stupidity Avoided learning and using an Integrated development environment .
Consequence Inability to build test and deploy the application quickly and generally do anything useful .
What should I have done Get familiar with an IDE .
NetBeans , eclipse etc .
5. Transactions
Stupidity
Not using them .

FOSS Execs Send Open Letter to Obama
by Ostatic Staff - Feb. 10 , 2009
Executives representing several open source software companies collaborated on an open letter to President Barack Obama in the hopes of moving open source solutions to the top of the list of ways to implement parts of his national economic stimulus plan .
The letter asks Obama to make FOSS a " key component " of all new technology initiatives implemented during his administration .
Of course , that 's a tall order .
Under Obama 's new plan , everything from digitized medical records and nationwide high - speed Internet access to improved classroom technology stands to benefit in some way .
Stuart Cohen , CEO of Collaborative Software Initiative , is confident that this letter is the first step toward helping determine which initiatives should get attention first .
" We 're all looking forward to meeting with the appointed CTO and his or her team to help nail down these priorities , " says Cohen .
" What 's more important today is to make sure that collaboration is the fuel for developing and delivering these new technologies .
Collaborative development and community sourcing result in lower cost products , higher quality and code and the transparency we all expect . "
As a way to underscore how open source is already being successfully used to address specific needs within the government , the authors point to TriSano , the open source surveillance system recently deployed statewide in Utah to monitor for infectious disease and bioterrorism attacks .
Cohen says the project demonstrates just how effective open source solutions can be .
" TriSano is the result of collaboration among state epidemiologists , local health departments , and software developers , proving that local and state governments can work together to produce high quality software products .
TriSano is still in its infancy , but we believe it will be looked upon as an example of how this is done . "
Cohen says he and the other executives that crafted the letter think it 's a great way to open the door to future dialogue with the Obama administration and whomever is eventually he names CTO .
" We look forward to talking in more detail with him or her when they are appointed , and believe this letter starts the right conversation .
In the true spirit of open source , the letter is available online in its entirety for the community to sign and leave comments of their own .
A majority of Ukrainians believe that Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko should resign , according to the public opinion poll held by Kyiv International Sociology Institute .
Asked who should resign – Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko or Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko – 57 percentof respondents opted for the president ’s resignation , 16.4 percentsupported Tymoshenko ’s resignation , and 26.6 percentfound it difficult to answer .
Asked if Yushchenko should heed the calls of certain politicians to resign , 70.9 percentof the polled said that the president should follow this advice , whereas 19.3 percentconsider he should rather stay in the office .
A total of 19.3 percent refused to answer this question .

A far - right Dutch MP whose film linking Islamic texts with the terror attacks on New York sparked protests around the Muslim world was last night banned from entering Britain .
Geert Wilders , who leads the small Dutch Freedom Party , was due to show his controversial 17 - minute film at an event in the House of Lords tomorrow , but was informed yesterday by British officials that he would not be allowed to enter the country .
The decision sparked an immediate diplomatic row after the Dutch Government pressed Britain to reverse the ban .
The film Fitna , which criticises the Koran as a " fascist book " , sparked violent protests around the Muslim world last year .
The film , which has been posted on the internet , juxtaposes images of the Koran with footage of the 9/11 twin tower attacks and other terrorist atrocities .
Mr Wilders had been invited to show the film at an event in Westminster hosted by Lord Pearson of Rannoch , the former Conservative , who is now a UK Independence Party member of the House of Lords .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The film starts with an image of the hugely controversial cartoon of the Prophet Mohamed with a bomb as a turban that sparked global protests after it was printed in a Danish newspaper .
The film then shows images of the 9/11 aircraft flying into the World Trade Centre , with quotes from calls to the emergency services from people inside the buildings .
It also contains images of bloodstained corpses following the 2004 Madrid rail bombings before showing gruesome images of beheadings and attacks .
The film then shows statistics indicating a growing Muslim population in the Netherlands .
Last night , the Home Office refused to comment on Mr Wilders ' case .
But a spokesman said : " The Government opposes extremism in all forms .
It will stop those who want to spread extremism , hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country .
That was the driving force behind tighter rules on exclusions for unacceptable behaviour that the Home Secretary announced in October last year . "
Mr Wilders , who lives with round - the - clock security after receiving death threats , said a letter from the British embassy informed him he was being refused entry because his views " threaten community harmony and therefore public security " in the UK .
He condemned the British Government 's decision as " cowardly " .
" This is something you 'd expect from Saudia Arabia , not Great Britain , " Mr Wilders told a parliamentary session .
But he signalled that he might make the journey to London on Thursday despite the ban .
" I am seriously considering just trying it out and just getting on the plane , " he said .
" Then I 'll see what happens .
Let them handcuff me , " he was quoted as telling Dutch newspaper NRC .
The Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said his government would continue to press Britain to reverse the ban .
He said he " deeply regretted " that a Dutch lawmaker had been barred entry to the UK .
Mr Verhagen said he had first contacted the British ambassador in The Hague .
Having failed , Mr Verhagen then telephoned his British counterpart David Miliband .
" It is highly regrettable that a Dutch parliamentarian is refused entry to another EU country , " he said in a statement .
Mr Wilders , whose Freedom Party holds nine of the 120 seats in the Dutch Parliament , said he was shocked by the travel ban .
He said : " We are talking here about a European Union country , one of the oldest democracies in the Western world . "
Lord Pearson , who invited Wilders to show Fitna at the House of Lords , said he was " very surprised " at the news and was looking into what had happened to the Dutch MP .
“ Dear friends , I should like to greet you personally to this place , in the development of which I have taken enormous personal interest , and for this reason I am asking you to take a special interest in it .
What you see is the outcome of 18 months of hard work on the part of a group of extremely professional Chilean engineers who have devoted their efforts to solving corporate management problems .
They have created for us a series of tools to help us in the task of controlling the economy .
Modern science , and specifically electronic computer science , offers the Government a new opportunity to address modern economic problems .
We have seen that the power of this science has not yet been used in the so - called developed countries .
We have developed a system on our own .
What you are about to hear today is revolutionary – not only because this is the first time that this is applied in the world - it is revolutionary because we are making a deliberate effort to give the people the power that science gives to us , enabling them to use it freely ” .
Stafford Beer
I would first like to say that I understand that police have to deal with the worst scum sucking , beer drinking , drug abusing , unintellectual , violent , sociopaths that this country can dish out .
It takes a certain kind of person to deal with those lowlifes day in and day out .
Secondly , I would like to apologize to all the excellent police officers that do their part to keep the peace and to help their communities .
Police officers that have to deal with the ‘ bad guys ’ also have to deal with normal people and it seems that they have a very hard time adjusting to people who are educated and exercise their civil rights .
Does America have a systemic problem with their police officers ?
Are people rightfully afraid of the police who are supposed to protect and serve ?
Excessive Force
Police are armed with deadly weapons and are put into high stress situations .
Have you heard about the rioting in Oakland , CA ?
A crowd gathers around the police and in a panic they shoot a man who is unarmed and immobilized .
Do you know what it is called if I shoot someone ?
Murder .
What is is called when a BART police officer shoots someone ?
… officials are looking into the possibility that the officer thought he was firing a Taser and pulled out his gun by mistake .
So , I guess that would be an accident .
BART Police Officer Shoots Immobilized Unarmed Man
Why do people protest ?
Because they are underrepresented .
This is how police detain protesters … by placing a knee on their neck .
The hospitals say the police excessively use force when detaining people .
Remember Rodney King ?
Anyway , doctors do n’t want to rock the boat and most cases of excessive force are undocumented .
The most common injuries resulting from the excessive use of force by police officers against suspects involved blunt trauma of the sort you get from a punch or a beating .
“ Fists and feet were cited as the instrument used by 95.2 % ( 95 % CI 92.0 % to 97.3 % ) of respondents , handcuffs that were too tight by 73.1 % ( 95 % CI 67.6 % to 78.1 % ) , night sticks by 48.6 % ( 95 % CI 42.7 % to 54.5 % ) and flashlights by 26.9 % … ”
And try and not forget our new meme , “ Do n’t taze me bro ! ”
Physicians say Police Use Too Much Force
What happens when a cop is given a gun ?
He uses it .
They roll onto to private property and when they find a dog that they think is threatening , they draw their gun and they shoot it .
Tough luck , poochie .
Oh yeah , they were n’t wearing uniforms .
Why does wearing a uniform make their job so much harder ?
How does America classify armed men out of uniform in foreign countries ?
They call them enemy combatants .
Follow this link to more puppy murder and mayhem .
Mistaken Identity
The next problem is that Police immediately stereotype people , which is where I think most of the problems are stemming from .
Do you know what happens if you are black in a white neighborhood ?
You get mistaken as a criminal .
Specifically , you get targeted as a car thief because you are driving an SUV .
Then your family comes out to confront the police who are on their property for no good reason .
Your mom gets shoved into the garage .
You put your head up from the concrete to ask what is happening .
Guess what happens ?
You get shot in the back , while you are unarmed and laying in a prone position .
Police Shoot Man in case of Racial Profiling
There seems to be quite a few cases of mistaken identity coming out of Texas .
It seems that if you are black and wearing short shorts , then you are prostitute .
Three plain clothes officers tried to arrest a girl in her front yard .
Her screaming brought her dad outside where he fought the police and she escaped .
Did I mention they were not wearing uniforms ?
They were responding to a prostitution call that was blocks away .
Oh yeah , to put the icing on the cake , the girl and the father are being prosecuted for assaulting polices officers .
And she was arrested at her school where she is an honor student .
What did the city have to say about this ?
The city has investigated the matter and found that the conduct of the police officers was appropriate under the circumstances
Did I mention they were n’t wearing uniforms and were trying to force a 12 year old girl into a van ?
She is having nightmares about police .
Plain clothes police do not make sense to me .
It ’s not like they were undercover at the time .
Police arrest 12 year old girl
Shameful Behavior
I would like to share with you something I think I read before ( but I do n’t have a link and cannot verify it ) : Criminals and Police Officers tend to share the same psychological profile .
They enjoy the feeling of power and using force to intimidate or force people to do something against their will .
Anyone , read this before ?
Either way here are some more stories .
In New York there is a group of people that advocate the riding of bikes to help reduce traffic and stop pollution .
They would get together at night and have a huge group of people go for a ride through the city .
They had a number of conflicts with police .
Well , they decided to find if their actions were illegal .
A judge allowed them to keep doing their bike rides since they were not causing trouble and were not obstructing traffic .
Well , I guess if you ’re a cop and you do n’t agree with them you do this :
On the bright side , this officer is getting prosecuted .
Let ’s hear it for video cameras .
A group called Kop Busters is starting to set stings on corrupt policing organizations .
Read more about them here : Never Get Busted Again
Here is a video of police raiding a home that was growing ….
Christmas trees .
You see , police use thermal imaging from planes to find people growing marijuana with grow lamps in their homes .
This process is illegal and has been deemed ‘ unreasonable search ’ , but it happened anyway .
Kop Busters caught them red handed .
Also , a judge signed an affidavit to search the home based on an anonymous tip , which is also illegal .
Here is another protector of the people dumping a quadriplegic from their wheel chair .
And another story of Cops Stealing from Toys for Tots .
I hope the Marines find them and kick their ass .
This cop stole a laptop .
( What laptop ? )
Everyone in this country gets hassled by the Police .
Senator Leahy was stopped by a Border Agent many miles from the border mind you :
It ’s interesting – I went through one of those symbolic checkpoints in the state of New York driving back here .
It was about 125 miles from the border .
In a car with license plate one on it from Vermont .
With little letters underneath it that said US Senate .
We were stopped and ordered to get out of the car and prove my citizenship .
And I said “ what authority are you acting under ? ” and one of your agents pointed to his gun and said “ that ’s all the authority I need . ”
Encouraging way to enter our country .
Do you live in the Constitution Free Zone ?
Do n’t Talk to Cops
If there is anything to take away from this post is , “ Do n’t talk to Cops ” .
Watch this video to be astounded and disturbed and be educated on why you should never , ever , EVER talk to cops .
Is it just a few bad eggs or is the system fundamentally flawed ?
Why do police officers protect their own when those other officers have acted in an unprofessional manner ?
I really do think that we need to spend our money on good training for our officers .
Special attention needs to be given to how to deal with those with mental illness .
Additionally , training should be reinforced to protect constitutional rights .
Peaceful protesters should not be harassed .
We should really be focusing our time , money , and effort on violent criminals and dangers to the public .
Now , go forth and be good citizens , keep those cameras rolling , and exercise your 5th amendment rights and your civil liberties .
No , Hodgson did n’t “ invent ” India Pale Ale , and 18th century brewers before Hodgson were making beers that could survive a journey to India , and further .
A myth has developed that Hodgson , who brewed at the Bow brewery to the east of London , close to the Middlesex - Essex border , “ invented a new style of beer , brewing it to a high alcohol level and using more hops than any previous beers . ”
There is no evidence whatsoever that Hodgson “ invented ” or “ developed ” a new beer especially for the Indian market : no record that he did so , no claim by Hodgson or his successors that he did so .
India Pale
Ale was not even , in fact , a particularly strong beer for the time , being about 6.5 or seven per cent alcohol , around the same strength as porter .
Despite some modern commentators ’ declaration that India Pale
Ale needed to be invented because the big- selling beer in the late 18th century in Britain , porter , would not survive the four - month journey to the East , porter was perfectly capable of lasting on board a ship much longer than that , as this passage from the journal of Joseph Banks on August 25 1769 , when he was on board the Endeavour with Captain Cook in the South Pacific , shows :
It was this day a twelvemonth since we left England , in consequence of which a peice [ sic ] of cheshire cheese was taken from a locker where it had been reservd for this occasion and a cask of Porter tappd which provd excellently good , so that we livd like English men and drank the hea[l ] ths of our freinds in England .
If a cask of porter could be “ excellently good ” after a year at sea , there is no reason to suppose any other sort of similar - strength beer would have to be specially invented to last the four - month journey from Britain to India .
Brewers before Hodgson knew how to make strong , highly hopped beers that would keep for an extended period : the anonymous Every Man His Own Brewer of 1768 gives a recipe for two hogsheads of October “ malt wine ” made from the first two mashes off 22 bushels of malt , with six and a half pounds of hops per eight bushels of malt to ensure “ a year ’s keeping ” .
George Watkins , author of The Compleat English Brewer , first published in 1767 , said that October ale was brewed at a substantial 16 to 20 bushels to the hogshead , though “ those with 20 bushels are too heady and some go as low as 10 to 12 bushels . ”
Even at 10 bushels per hogshead , or 6 2/3rd bushels a barrel , this would still give an OG of 1140 or more .
October beer would be ready for bottling after 12 months , Watkins said , and should be kept in bottle for a further year , making it two years old before it was fit to drink .
Hodgson ’s involvement in the India trade seems to be based on two lucky chances .
The first was that the docks for the merchant ships that went to and from India , the East Indiamen , were at Blackwall on the Thames , just a short distance via the River Lea from his brewery .
When the captains of the East Indiamen went looking for beer to sell in Bombay , Calcutta and Madras , alongside a host of other goods from England including everything from china , to hams to furniture , they went to their nearest brewer , at Bow , rather than one of the big London concerns .
What evidence there is suggested that Hodgson made a number of beers , including porter , and an October - brewed “ stock ” bitter ale , of the kind described by Watkins , and that this stock ale was one of the beers the East Indiamen ships ’ captains bought off him to sell in India .
The Calcutta Gazette from January 20 1822 , for example , contained an advertisement for the “ select investment of prime London goods just landed from the HC [ Honourable Company ] ship Sir David Scott ” , including “ Hodgson ’s warranted prime picked pale ale of the genuine October brewing , warranted fully equal , if not superior , to any ever before received in the settlement . ”
The second lucky chance was that on the four - month voyage out to India via the Cape of Good Hope Hodgson ’s October stock ale underwent the sort of maturity in cask that would have taken two years in a cellar , and arrived in the East in prime condition .
There is no evidence Hodgson planned this from the start or knew it would happen : he was just lucky .
Another myth is that English brewers were eager to break into the Indian market .
In fact at the start of the 19th century the market was extremely small , just 9,000 barrels a year , equal to less than half a per cent of the two million barrels brewed in London alone every year .
Hodgson probably had around half of the Indian market , but that probably in large part because his brewery was close to where the East Indiamen docked , and because he was willing to allow the East Indiamen ship ’s captains extended credit , up to 18 months , on the beer they bought from him .

A newfound fungus living in rainforest trees makes biofuel more efficiently than any other known method , researchers say .
In fact , it 's so good at turning plant matter into fuel that researchers say their discovery calls into question the whole theory of how crude oil was made by nature in the first place .
While many crops and microbes can be combined to make biofuels — including the fungi that became infamous as jungle rot during WWII — the newfound fungus could greatly simplify the process , its discoverers claim .
Researchers have suggested that billions of acres of fallow farmland could be used to grow the raw material of biofuels .
But turning corn stalks or switchgrass into fuel is a painstaking process and the end product is expensive and not entirely friendly to the environment .
The fungus , which has been named Gliocladium roseum , stands out in the crowd .
" This is the only organism that has ever been shown to produce such an important combination of fuel substances , " said researcher Gary Strobel from Montana State University .
" The fungus can even make these diesel compounds from cellulose , which would make it a better source of biofuel than anything we use at the moment . "
The scientists are now working to develop its fuel producing potential , according to a paper published in the November issue of the journal Microbiology .
The fungus grows inside the Ulmo tree in the Patagonian rainforest in South America .
" When we examined the gas composition of G. roseum , we were totally surprised to learn that it was making a plethora of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives , " the stuff of diesel , Strobel said .
The fuel it produces has been dubbed " myco- diesel . "
Cellulose , lignin and hemicellulose make up the cell walls in plants .
They makes the stalks , sawdust and woodchip and cannot be digested by most living things .
Some 400 million tons of this plant waste is produced ever year just from farmland , Strobel and his colleagues say .
In current biofuel production , this waste is treated with enzymes called cellulases that turn the cellulose into sugar .
Microbes then ferment this sugar into ethanol that can be used as a fuel .
If G. roseum can be used commercially to make fuel , a step could be skipped .
" We were very excited to discover that G. roseum can digest cellulose .
Although the fungus makes less myco - diesel when it feeds on cellulose compared to sugars , new developments in fermentation technology and genetic manipulation could help improve the yield , " Strobel explained .
" In fact , the genes of the fungus are just as useful as the fungus itself in the development of new biofuels . "
The discovery also questions assumptions about how fossil fuels are made .
" The accepted theory is that crude oil , which is used to make diesel , is formed from the remains of dead plants and animals that have been exposed to heat and pressure for millions of years , " Strobel said .
" If fungi like this are producing myco - diesel all over the rainforest , they may have contributed to the formation of fossil fuels . "
Christian groups have been urged by a senior DUP politician to launch a counter - strike to the “ There is Probably No God ” bus advertising campaign .
Gregory Campbell wants alternative adverts that add : “ But What If There Is ? ” in response to the British Humanist Association ’s ( BHA ) posters , which were launched in London and will be used across the UK .
The organisation wants to spread a “ humanised ” message that people should “ stop worrying and start enjoying life ” .
Mr Campbell , MP for East Londonderry , tabled an Early Day Motion in Parliament highlighting that “ the rationale behind it is that people can be less careful about their lifestyle choices and general approach to life 's consequences by discounting the likelihood of a Creator and an afterlife ” .
The Atheist Bus Campaign was launched in response to Christian adverts that featured web links to sites that said non-Christians would burn in hell for all eternity .
The BHA — which describes itself as a national charity representing people who seek to live good lives without religious beliefs — tells people there is absolutely no reason to worry about not being religious .
It declined to comment on the motion , also backed by Independent MP Bob Spink and Conservative Nicholas Winterton .

Well , either this story will make you laugh or cringe ( or both ) .
According to the Arizona Daily Star , Tucson - area cable TV broadcasted porn during the Super Bowl :
A short clip of a pornographic movie cut into a Comcast broadcast of the Super Bowl in homes in and around Tucson .
Officials at Comcast confirmed that its signal was interrupted during the Super Bowl , but the company is still working to figure out how porn broke into its cable feed .
Engineers at Comcast will be working throughout the night to determine what happened , said Kelle Maslyn , a Comcast spokeswoman .
Well , this would certainly top the infamous Janet Jackson / Justin Timberlake flash from a few years back .
I suppose that it could have been worse , too ( imagine if the interruption had been a full - on Rick Roll ) .
This report also states that Comcast ’s digital feed was untouched – only the analog / standard TV signal was affected .
Let this be a lesson to you laggards : UPGRADE TO DIGITAL , ALREADY .
Obviously , Comcast will have to answer a very important question : how the heck did this happen ?!
They ’ve been accused of traffic shaping , but now they ’re going to be accused of broadcasting immorality ?
Well , traffic shaping IS immoral …
Anyway , I ’m sure the amount of complaints were equal : 50 % complained that it happened , and 50 % complained that they did n’t show enough .

From Chuck Todd :
Is Commerce Dept. Built Ford Tough ?
Posted : Friday , February 13 , 2009 6:01 PM by Chuck Todd
From NBC ’s Chuck Todd Harold Ford Jr. for Commerce Secretary ?
It ’s something a few Democrats around town are pushing and , according to sources , the idea of appointing the former Tennessee Congressman is being given serious thought by folks high up in the Obama administration .
On paper , Ford checks a lot of boxes for a an easy - to - confirm nominee for this post :
He ’s a pro-business Democrat ( remember , this is Commerce Secretary so the job is to be a promoter of business ) ; he ’s a former member of the Congressional Black Caucus ( you ’ll recall this whole kerfuffle over control of the census under a Judd Gregg - led Commerce Dept. was started by complaints from the CBC ) ; and he ’s a practiced spokesperson on TV ( the Geithner rollout this week is a reminder that the administration does n’t have enough solid media savvy members of his team who can sell the administration ’s policies . ) .
Mr. President , I know I do n’t need to tell you this .
I know you ’re smart enough to know that appointing Harold Ford , Jr. to ANYTHING is a mistake .
He is a snake that ca n’t be trusted .
There are enough Black folk who were actually loyal and supportive of you that you could nominate – HERE IS A POST GIVING YOU A LIST – than for you to nominate someone who had nothing good to say about you , and repeatedly - throughout the ENTIRE ELECTION SEASON – did nothing but try and undermine you at every turn .
You loved your grandmother ; he LIED on his for votes .
Reward those that supported YOU , Mr. President .
Harold Ford , Jr. would never be YOUR choice .
You could NEVER doubt that he’d be trying to undermine you at every turn .
While I and others would welcome an African - American in the position of Secretary of Commerce , I ’d rather someone honest , than a complete , untrustworthy snake like Ford .
Besides the ‘ character ’ question , how is he remotely qualified ?
And so it begins ...
White House administration will next week hold a joint " disaster scenario " exercise with top members of the incoming team of president - elect Barack Obama , US officials said Friday .

WASHINGTON ( AFP ) –
The outgoingwill next week hold a joint " disaster scenario " exercise with top members of the incoming team of president - elect Barack Obama , US officials said Friday .
After reading this , I left my thoughts wander for a bit ...
Hey , was n't it the same scenario when NY 9/11 and London 7/7 happen ?
Arts & Stats
That is not hard to answer either ...
One could simply put the answer as " when US Government needs it " , but that 's not all to it .
Government is not the boss here , not in this story ...
Who 's the Boss ?
Have you noticed lately that every time US Government is short with the money they need to borrow ?
Precisely , they ask for the loan from Fed !
So , Fed is the boss .
It 's their money .
It has been a long time since US Government lost the control over the state finance giving out the money printing right to the Bank of Federal Reserves .
The best part is : Fed is " quasi- public ( government entity with private components ) " .
So , the real answer is : " Another false flag attack will happen when the people who print the dollar say so !
And they are private bankers . "
But what is the point of false flag attacks against US and how would private bankers profit from it ?
Watch the video for the answer :
How do you sleep Mr. Rockefeller ?
Paulo Coelho once wrote something like : " If something happened once , it might never happen again .
But if it happened twice , it will happen for the third time for sure .
" According to 9/11 whistleblowers and conspiracy theorists , some of 37 % US citizens believe that 9/11 was " false flag staged by and used by US Government as worldwide accepted excuse for further military operations " .
If you are not in that group , ask yourself just who profited the most from 9/11 tragedy ?
Or even better , let 's put all the arguments aside and let 's discuss this : if you are ready to believe that some of 20 average individuals could overpass the security system of the most advanced civilization known to history , then you are even greater conspiracist than me !
I have no doubt another false flag is on the way .
The only question is : when ?

Thanks to advances in satellite technology , college students are giving government intelligence a run for its money .
A student geography project from UCLA made waves in the Harvard International review for using principles of wildlife diversity to narrow bin Laden ’s likely location to a few promising structures in Pakistan .
Bin Laden has everything in common with a member of a species trying to escape extinction .
This allowed the UCLA students used theories of wildlife dispersion to predict his whereabouts .
For example , biogeographical distance - decay theory suggests that as we look further from some initial site , the composition of an ecosystem will change exponentially .
So , the further bin Laden gets from his last known location in Pakistan , the less he 'll like the demographics .
According to the researchers , if bin Laden strays far he ’ll be likely to find himself in more secular regions , with a less secure network of allies .
This allows the researchers to define a high - probability radius for Bin Laden surrounding his last known location .
Then there 's island biogeographic theory .
Islands that are large and close together provide a series of convenient microecosystems ; species can easily hop to a new island if their own becomes inhospitable .
This applies to bin Laden ’s impending extinction if we draw an analogy between an archipelago and a city .
If bin Laden sticks to larger cities , he ’ll have more resources and more safe places to hide .
The specific needs of bin Laden helps to narrow down the search as well .
If you wo n't find pandas far from bamboo , you wo n't find bin Laden far from his entourage of bodyguards and his dialysis machine .
The researchers provided a list of details about Bin Laden that would influence his location .
He is 6 ’ 4 ” , so his living quarters can’t have low ceilings .
And he ’s been shown to avoid locations with a clear aerial view .
Knowing a little bit about bin Laden 's life helped the researchers to choose three good sites from over 1,000 possible buildings in Parachinar , Pakistan .
Notably , another group of students attempted a similar geographic prediction in 2006 , but the results were far less precise .
At the time , satellite imagery of the region was limited to pixels of 30mx30 m , or 100 feet square .
The resolution simply was n’t good enough .
Today student researchers were able to use open - source imagery of topography and photography down to 0.4 m pixels , including information from Google Earth

The music industry , struggling to find workable business models for the digital age , apparently can't even give its product away .
Ad - supported services like SpiralFrog have generated what can only be charitably called a " lack of enthusiasm , " while another ad - supported service called Ruckus just shut its virtual doors this weekend .
Such services were once held up as the answer to ( first ) collegiate music piracy and ( eventually ) to music piracy in general , but the ridiculous encumbrances offered by DRM helped ensure that neither solution proved compelling .
Raising a Ruckus
Legal music subscription services once looked like a possible way of dealing with campus copyright infringement ; if students were simply given the music , why would they continue torrenting ?
But initial experiments with paid sites like the revamped Napster generated an outcry as students objected to having their school fees used to pay for services that many did not want or could not use .
Ruckus looked like an incredible solution .
Back in 2006 , it dropped its own subscription model , went ad - supported , and focused exclusively on the collegiate market .
Schools had to sign deals with Ruckus , but the service was offered to students free of charge , which eliminated one big objection .
Schools could show the music industry , which had been pursuing them through legislation at the state and federal level , that they were making a good faith effort to address the infringement problem ( the services were so popular with administrators , at least , that 39 percent of schools in the US were offering one last year ) .
Schools kept themselves out of trouble , the music industry earned revenue and addressed infringement , Ruckus rolled around in ad revenue , and students got free music .
That was the plan , anyway .
Those who knew something about technology might have looked at the idea and concluded that it was unlikely to be compelling , but it convinced plenty of other people .
For instance , when the Ruckus service came to Princeton , the student newspaper reported this telling comment from student body president - elect Rob Biederman : the Ruckus deal would " completely alleviate " the copyright infringement issues on campus .
Data source : EDUCAUSE
But it did n't , and the reasons were n't hard to find .
One thing that plagued Ruckus and most similar services has been DRM — and because Apple 's Fairplay has not been licensed , that has generally meant some flavor of Microsoft DRM .
This had several obvious consequences .
First , it meant that students had to access the music through a Windows PC .
Not a big deal , right ?
But it was a big deal , because Apple has made tremendous inroads in the college market .
For instance , at Princeton , Macs accounted for an astonishing 40 percent of all student computers in 2008 .
Second , the DRM was used to keep the songs from being burned to CD or even transferred to digital music players ( not that this last restriction mattered all that much , since the DRMed tracks would n't have played on iPods , anyway , and would have been of little value to most students ) .
It also was n't long before this " innovative " idea was n't quite so innovative .
Services like Last.fm opened up their own ad - supported streaming content to anyone , and Ruckus eventually had to open its offering to any student with an .edu e-mail address in an attempt to attract more users .
That apparently did n't happen , and it did n't help that the advertising market has been collapsing .
So Ruckus pulled the plug on Friday , replacing its Web site with a graphic that said only , " Unfortunately the Ruckus service will no longer be provided .
Thanks . "
School - sponsored music is dead ?
The demise of Ruckus will probably put an end to schools ' experimentation with offering legal music services to their students , at least in the short term .
On the one hand , remaining subscription services still require fees and come with too many restrictions to be compelling .
On the other hand , there 's no real reason to " offer " a free , ad - supported service ; students can simply access several of these through the Web .
Schools may be tempted to make one more attempt , but using a different model .
Ad - supported services might be good for browsing or sampling , but network connectivity is n't yet quite good enough to make students give up their iPods and rely on music stored in the cloud .
So long as this situation persists , students will demand full control of their music , and music companies are looking for ways to give that to them .
Warner , in particular , is working on an initiative allowing unlimited downloading of music in any format , from any source , for a flat fee paid to the ISP .
For colleges , this means a fee paid to the school by every student , but such a move would likely provoke less controversy because all students could actually make use of the music .
Johannes Mehserle , the BART police officer who fatally shot a man on the Fruitvale Station platform in Oakland early New Year 's Day , is being kept under wraps and moved from place to place after receiving a number of death threats , BART spokesman Linton Johnson confirmed Tuesday night .
Mehserle , 27 , a two - year veteran of the BART police force , shot and killed 22 - year - old Oscar Grant of Hayward as Grant lay face - down on the station platform following a fight between two groups on a train .
While the nature of the threats has n't been revealed , Johnson said at least one of the threats was made to Mehserle 's family .
As a result , he has been moved twice .
Mehserle is described as " devastated " over the shooting , but has yet to give a statement to investigators .
Johnson said the delay was caused when Mehserle 's attorney showed up at the station within two hours of the shooting and invoked the officer 's right to " retain counsel and not say anything . "
Probes by BART police and the Alameda County district attorney were further hampered because investigators were off over the holiday weekend .
On Friday , Mehserle 's girlfriend had a baby - and then , to further complicate matters , BART passengers ' videos of the Fruitvale Station incident began showing up on the airwaves .
BART lawyers and brass have been in scramble mode ever since .
Johnson said Mehserle 's attorney " has not made it easy to schedule him for an interview , but hopefully he 'll be coming in very soon . "
Odds are : If Mehserle is charged with a crime in Grant 's shooting , it will be a first .
No one we talked with - from the district attorney 's office to lawyers who work either side of police shootings - could remember a case in the last 20 years in which an on -duty officer had been charged in a fatal shooting in Alameda County .
" By and large , police officers have been reacting to some type of situation before they shoot someone that usually provides a legal justification , " said District Attorney Tom Orloff , who has seen dozens of police shooting cases during his nearly four - decade career as a prosecutor .
Orloff , whose office would ultimately decide whether Mehserle should be charged with anything , hastened to point out that many details about the Fruitvale Station shooting remain unknown and that it is far too early to know whether the case will enter the criminal arena .
The most recent controversial police shooting in Alameda County happened July 25 , when Oakland police Officer Hector Jimenez shot a drunken - driving suspect in the back as the man ran from an early morning traffic stop in the Fruitvale District .
Police said Jimenez shot 27 - year - old Mack " Jody " Woodfox III because he thought Woodfox was reaching into his waistband for a gun , although no gun was found .
Jimenez gave the same reason for taking part in the fatal shooting New Year 's Eve 2007 of another man , Andrew Moppin , who , like Woodfox , turned out to be unarmed .
Police and a deputy from the district attorney 's office interviewed Jimenez after the Woodfox shooting , then went out to the scene at night and re-enacted the incident as the officer related it .
The result - although technically the case is still pending , no charges have been filed .
John Burris , the Grant family 's attorney , has sued Oakland police on behalf of the Woodfox family , filing a $ 25 million civil rights suit in federal court .
Burris filed a legal claim in the BART case Tuesday , a precursor to what he says will be another $ 25 million suit .
" Police do n't get charged because D.A. 's and police work together , so they sort of get a pass , " Burris said .
" That 's why you have lawyers like myself .
If you did n't , nothing would be done . "
Mayor in waiting : Oakland City Councilman Ignacio De La Fuente is no stranger to the inner workings of government .
Check out his latest move .
Lacking the interest - or at least the needed five votes - to stay on as council president , De La Fuente opted not to seek a new term this week and instead backed Councilwoman Jane Brunner .
De La Fuente then promptly got himself elected to the lower - profile job of vice mayor .
Now , if Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums lands a Washington appointment within the next year - as has been speculated - Vice Mayor De La Fuente would become Mayor De La Fuente for as long as six months while the city set up a special election .
In which case De La Fuente , who has already run twice for mayor , could conceivably be a candidate .
" I always manage to make it interesting , do n't I ? " De La Fuente said .
" Just when people think I 'm dead , I just keep rolling . "
The envelope please : Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums should have checked his own son's acting credits before he came out swinging against HBO for using Oakland as the setting for the series " Gentlemen of Leisure , " which depicts the life of an aging pimp .
The mayor felt the series would present Oakland in a bad light - just as some think " The Wire " did for Baltimore .
It turns out that Dellums ' 44 - year - old actor son , Erik Todd Dellums , appeared a half - dozen times in " The Wire . "
The younger Dellums also played a drug kingpin in several episodes of the popular network show " Homicide : Life on the Street . "
Apparently , that was news to the mayor 's staffers .
When we called them for comment , they were speechless .
Coming out : San Francisco fundraiser Wade Randlett was at a function Monday night at Van 's steakhouse in Washington , D.C. , for that other Illinois senator - Dick Durbin - when in walked President - elect Barack Obama .
" The place went from a free - flowing cocktail party to a mosh pit , " Randlett said , with 300 or so hard - bitten lobbyists , lawyers and Washington insiders all surging toward the door for a chance to shake Obama 's hand .
Or at least snap a camera phone picture of themselves standing near the future president .
Honored guest :

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- A British TV channel was scheduled to air a controversial documentary Wednesday night showing a terminally ill man committing assisted suicide .
Craig Ewert dictates a letter to his children before leaving for his assisted suicide in Switzerland .
The film follows retired university professor Craig Ewert during the last four days of his life in 2006 , when he visited a Swiss clinic with his wife , Mary , in order to die .
The 59 - year - old suffered from motor neurone disease ( MND ) , which deprived him of the use of his arms and legs and caused him to be on a ventilator , Mary Ewert told The Independent .
MND destroys the body 's motor nerves , eventually resulting in paralysis .
Most sufferers die within five years of diagnosis although scientist Stephen Hawking has survived with the disease for more than 40 years .
" Right to Die : The Suicide Tourist " shows Ewert lying in a rented Zurich apartment , where an employee of the clinic prepares a lethal dose of drugs for Ewert to drink .
As the camera rolls , and with his wife by his side , Craig Ewert then closes his eyes and dies .
Mary Ewert said her husband wanted his death to be filmed in order to show that a terminal illness does not have to result in a painful death .
" For Craig , my husband , allowing the cameras to film his last moments in Zurich was about facing the end of life honestly , " she told The Independent .
Watch more about the case »
" He was keen to have it shown because when death is hidden and private , people do n't face their fears about it .
They do n't acknowledge that it is going to happen , they do n't reflect on it , they do n't want to face it .
That 's the taboo . "
What 's your view ?

Ewert was an American who lived in North Yorkshire , England with his wife .
In a clip on the Web site of British satellite channel Sky Real Lives , which planned to air the documentary , he dictates an e-mail to his son and daughter in America .
" I truly expect that death is the end , that there is no everlasting soul , no afterlife , " Ewert says .
" This is a journey that we all must make at some time .
I would hope that this is not a cause of major distress to those who love me and I expect that my dear sweet wife will have the greatest loss , as we have been together for 37 years in the deepest intimacy . "
Read explainer about assisted suicide
The scheduled airing of the documentary provoked controversy in Britain .
It was featured on the front pages of several newspapers , with the Daily Mirror asking in bold letters , " Is this an insight into the issue of euthanasia or just a cynical attempt to boost ratings ? "
The production company behind the film says it explores the difficult choices made by patients and families of those who commit assisted suicide .
" ' The Suicide Tourist will take the audience on a journey they could only have imagined , and will not forget , " Point Grey Pictures says on its Web site .
Oscar - winning Canadian filmmaker John Zaritsky made the documentary with the family 's permission and gained rare access to the Dignitas clinic in Zurich , where Ewert died .
Mary Ewert told The Independent that she was " very happy " with how the film turned out .
Opponents of assisted suicide said , however , the film was cheap voyeurism .
" I think it 's reducing somebody 's death to a kind of reality show , a peep show .
I think it 's very cheap , " said Phyllis Bowman , executive director of Right to Life .
Bowman said she feared the film would encourage the idea of assisted suicide .
That was echoed by Care Not Killing , an alliance of human rights , disability rights , and health care groups .
" The disproportionate media coverage given to a very small handful of persistent people , desperate to end their lives , creates the false impression that there is a growing demand for assisted dying , " Care Not Killing said in a statement on its Web site .
The group said more attention should be paid to palliative care for dying people , rather than assisted dying .
It is against the law in the United Kingdom to help someone commit suicide , and it can bring a prison sentence of as long as 14 years .
Recent court cases have sought clarity on the law , however , saying it does not specify at what point assistance begins .
Swiss law says only that helping someone commit suicide must not be for personal gain .
Bryan Campen sent FlickrMail to let me know that Joe Ades , aka the gentleman carrot peeler , who we featured on FlickrBlog a couple of years ago , has passed away :
“ The city lost one its quintessential characters Sunday when the enigmatic Joe Ades died after decades spent selling his $ 5 vegetable peelers at the Union Square Greenmarket , and other locations around town .
Ades , born in Manchester , England , was an unavoidable and entertaining presence at Union Square , and eventually became something of a media darling for his loud , hypnotic patter ; his distinctive suits ; and his incongruous Park Avenue address . ”

United States mortgage giant Fannie Mae has announced a third quarter loss of $ 43 billion due to the slump in the real estate sector .
The loss amounts to about $ 19 a share .
In comparison , during the second quarter of this year Fannie Mae lost just $ 3.3 billion or $ 3.69 a share .
The US Government took control of Fannie Mae and its sister company Freddie Mac two months ago in an effort to avert a major meltdown of the financial system .

Now that George W. Bush has left the harsh glare of the White House and Barack Obama has settled into the highest office in the land , it might be reasonable to suppose that Bush hatred and Obama euphoria will begin to subside .
Unfortunately , there is good reason to doubt that the common sources that have nourished these dangerous political passions will soon lose their potency .
At first glance , Bush hatred and Obama euphoria could not be more different .
Hatred of Mr. Bush went well beyond the partisan broadsides typical of democratic politics .
For years it disfigured its victims with open , indeed proud , loathing for the very manner in which Mr. Bush walked and talked .
It compelled them to denounce the president and his policies as not merely foolish or wrong or contrary to the national interest , but as anathema to everything that made America great .
In contrast , the euphoria surrounding Mr. Obama 's run for president conferred upon the candidate immunity from criticism despite his newness to national politics and lack of executive experience , and regardless of how empty his calls for change .
At the same time , it inspired those in its grips , repeatedly bringing them tears of joy throughout the long election season .
With Mr. Obama 's victory in November and his inauguration last week , it suffused them with a sense that not only had the promise of America at last been redeemed but that the world could now be transfigured .
In fact , Bush hatred and Obama euphoria -- which tend to reveal more about those who feel them than the men at which they are directed -- are opposite sides of the same coin .
Both represent the triumph of passion over reason .
Both are intolerant of dissent .
Those wallowing in Bush hatred and those reveling in Obama euphoria frequently regard those who do not share their passion as contemptible and beyond the reach of civilized discussion .
Bush hatred and Obama euphoria typically coexist in the same soul .
And it is disproportionately members of the intellectual and political class in whose souls they flourish .
To be sure , democratic debate has always been a messy affair in which passion threatens to overwhelm reason .
So long as citizens remain free and endowed with a diversity of interests and talents , it will remain so .
( CNN ) --
Both sides in the Congo rebel fighting that has displaced thousands of people seem committed to maintaining the days - old cease - fire , the top U.S. diplomat for Africa said Saturday .
Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer , in an interview with CNN International , was asked whether troops of the Democratic Republic of Congo and followers of rebel Tutsi General Laurent Nkunda were intent on disengaging their forces .
" So far , yes , " Frazer said from Kigali , Rwanda , one of Congo 's neighbors .
" I think we 're starting to move down a political track , but I certainly do think that it 's very fragile , " she said .
Frazer 's comments came on a day when the United Nations and other relief agencies delivered food and water to a refugee camp north of Goma , where Nkunda established a narrow " humanitarian corridor " after the cease - fire started Wednesday .
Tens of thousands of hungry people scrambled and fought Saturday for their first meal in several days .
Foreign Affairs Correspondent Jonathan Miller of Britain's Channel 4 videotaped the " complete pandemonium " in the Kabati camp for displaced persons about 10 miles north of Goma , where he said people were " desperate , scared , hungry . "
In one area , aid workers were handing out biscuits -- but only to children .
" You see how desperate the needs are .
People have n't eaten in several days , since they fled Monday and Tuesday .
It 's a drop in the ocean , " said an unnamed aid worker .
There were thousands of people beyond the camp that aid workers were unable to reach , the worker said .
A woman at the camp told Miller : " Since I left my home village ... I have n't eaten anything .
We can't go back home because we fear those who forced us to flee .
They 're killing us , and they 're raping the women . "
The Kabati camp 's population grew from 1,000 to about 50,000 over a few days this week as people fled the advance of rebel soldiers .
The United Nations ' refugee agency estimated Friday that 1 million people had been displaced by the recent fighting .
Getting Nkunda 's National Congress for the Defense of the People back into a political process , ensuring regional and international cooperation and enforcing the cease - fire are most important to returning eastern Congo to stability , Frazer said Saturday .
Both sides need to return to promises made in peace agreements signed in 2007 and early 2008 in Nairobi , Kenya , and Goma , capital of North Kivu province , according to Frazer .
Under the Nairobi accord , the Congolese government , among other things , agreed to rout Rwandan Hutu extremists who fled to eastern Congo after the Rwandan genocide of 1994 .
The Tutsi government in Rwanda , in turn , is being pressured to stop supporting the Congolese rebels in Rwanda .
Frazer and diplomats from Britain and France have been shuttling between Goma and Kigali , meeting this weekend with leaders to determine how a peace process can get back on track .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband was in Congo 's capital , Kinshasa , with his French counterpart , Bernard Kouchner .
He said of the humanitarian crisis , " It is essential it ends immediately .
There is only a political solution to this . "
Watch Miliband respond to questions about the crisis »
France holds the rotating presidency of the European Union , which is weighing its options , officials have said .
" We 're not at the moment looking at adding British troops to Congo " but want to be sure the 17,000 U.N. troops in the country are deployed most effectively , Miliband said .
Earlier Saturday , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown also stressed the need for a political solution .
" My worry is about the thousands of people being displaced at the moment by the violence that is taking place , " he said in a statement from Britain 's Foreign Office .
Britain's Africa minister , Lord Malloch - Brown , did not rule out the use of EU troops in the region .
He told BBC radio , " I think we 've certainly got to have it as an option , which is on the table and developed if we need it , but frankly the first line of call should be deployment of the U.N. 's own troops from elsewhere in the country ... but we have to have plans .
If all else fails , we can not stand back and watch violence erupt . "

Lee is a woman in the prime of life .
A happily married mother of two grown - up children , she is also a generous hostess and an excellent cook .
Her marriage to legendary publisher Herb Lee , who is thirty years her senior , is a relationship based on partnership , and it goes without saying that she will accompany her husband during the next phase of his life .
When Herb turns 80 the couple moves out of their luxury home in New York and into a formidable retirement village in Connecticut .
This is an idyllic world that promises to allow the pair to spend their remaining years together in quiet comfort
But inside , Pippa Lee , is anything but happy about this prospect and , deep within her subconscious , old reflexes are awakened .
Pippa
Lee was not always the poised and elegant woman she is now .
Her younger days were quite different , turbulent times , full of experiments with drugs and erotic escapades , times that also included a tablet - addicted mother and a rivals suicide .
Up to now it had looked as though she had been able to come to terms with her past .
But here in the sterile world of this third age paradise the sins of her youth begin to look more and more attractive to her .
Pippa takes up smoking again and , when she meets a good - looking man , her romantic desires are rekindled .
If she is to get to the bottom of her own personality Pippa Lee must face up to her past instead of avoiding it .
Rebecca Miller : Pippas real freedom lies in her ability to acquire a deeper understanding of her own life .

In October , Tom Greene was invited by email to interview for a vice president position he had applied for through CareerBuilder.com .
Before accepting , the sales and marketing executive called the search firm that posted the ad to ensure it was indeed a job opportunity .
Mr. Greene did n't want a repeat of two years ago , when he agreed to an interview in the same circumstances only to find there was no position available .
Instead , he had received a pitch from a career - marketing service costing up to $ 10,000 , starting with a $ 6,000 upfront fee .
Tim Foley
This time , the 53 - year - old was assured by phone that the job was real and he would n't be asked to dig into his wallet .
But after driving a half - hour from his home in Colonia , N.J. , to meet the firm 's recruiters , he says he found himself once again listening to a pitch for a career service , without any prospect of a job .
" It 's extremely frustrating , " says Mr. Greene , who weeks later was laid off from the financial - services company where he worked .
" You get very skeptical about the job market . "
If you 're launching an online job hunt for the first time in a while ; take caution .
What may look like an ad for employment may lead to something entirely different , like a hard sell for career services or job - training manuals .
Or worse , it might be a plan by identity thieves to get you to share sensitive personal information via " phishing " expeditions .
Some of the job postings -- sometimes for positions long filled -- also could be from recruiting agencies looking to collect résumés .
The problem of job postings that are n't what they seem is adding to the frustrations of the more than two million recently laid - off workers who are competing for an increasingly limited number of jobs .
The good news is that there are several tip - offs that indicate an ad is likely to lead you down the wrong path .
And as long as you do n't give out any private data , getting duped into responding to a fruitless job ad will likely only cost you time and energy .
Last fall , for instance , Mary LaFleur Langdon searched for children 's photography and teaching - assistant jobs near her home in Milford , N.H. , at craigslist.com .
She answered several ads that did n't name the hiring companies and received email responses all asking her to complete the same application at Career - Hub.com , which no longer exists .
After filling it out , Ms. LaFleur Langdon says she received an email instructing her to return to Career - Hub.com and provide additional information .
Once she did that , she says , she was directed to a Web page advertising various jobs and no explanation as to the fate of her application .
She completed the form again , and this time she answered " yes " to a question asking if she was interested in furthering her education .
The result was an ad for an online university .
" I was pretty angry , " says Ms. LaFleur Langdon , 46 years old .
Some recruiting agencies post ads for eye - catching positions to attract applicants for the less - desirable jobs in their portfolios , says Steven Greenberg , publisher of jobs4point0.com , a job site for experienced professionals .
Often the jobs were already filled , or they 're a composite of several ads .
Recruiting firms do this because " they 're looking to gather as many résumés as they can for posting the fewest ads , " says Mr. Greenberg .
Later , they 'll pitch these low - interest jobs to people whose résumés they 've collected in hopes they are desperate enough to take a less - attractive position .
Meanwhile , independent recruiters often dilute the marketplace by posting their own ads for the same position , says Elaine Rigoli , editor of the Fordyce Letter , a trade publication for recruiting professionals .
They 're competing against one another for a fee that comes with placing the winning candidate , she explains .
The ads contain different language and contact information , giving job hunters the false impression that there are several openings on the market , she says .
Still , it can be beneficial for job hunters to apply to them all since recruiters do n't always agree on who makes an ideal fit for a position , says Ms. Rigoli .
The ads to most watch out for are those pretending to offer a job but are really trying to get you to give up personal information , such as a bank - account or Social Security number .
They often mimic real postings , with some featuring company names and logos nearly identical to those of actual employers .
The individuals behind these postings may even exchange multiple emails with job hunters to build up trust .
To be sure , many job Web sites review submissions to try and prevent inappropriate ads from getting published .
A spokeswoman for CareerBuilder says the site employs a team to screen job postings and verify their information .
But job boards can't spot everything ahead of time , site publishers say .
" Fraudulent activity across the Internet continues to evolve and mutate , " writes CareerBuilder spokeswoman Jennifer Sullivan Grasz in an email .
Of 132 job - site publishers polled in October , 39 % said they frequently find ads that peddle sham investment opportunities or request personal information under false pretenses .
More than half said the review process regularly turns up ads to get job hunters to buy services or products , according to the survey by the International Association of Employment Web Sites , whose members power more than 60,000 job boards .
Some deceptive ads end up on job boards anyway because " scammers learn each time how to break through whatever the filter is that 's knocking them out , " says Gerry Crispin , co-founder of CareerXroads , a Kendall Park , N.J. , consulting firm that specializes in recruiting technology .
" They come back over and over again trying new techniques . "
Big job boards are particularly vulnerable , he adds .
So how can you tell if a job posting is insincere ?
One sign is that it lacks details about the hiring company and position , says Pam Dixon , executive director of the World Privacy Forum , a nonprofit group in Cardiff by the Sea , Calif. , that specializes in privacy matters .
Such an ad might describe an employer as a " major technology firm " rather than cite annual sales or say what kind of technology it produces .
It also might offer a vague job description or list a salary range spanning more than $ 50,000 .
Genuine ads typically target applicants who have a specific amount of experience and pay salaries commensurate with their backgrounds , says Ms. Rigoli of the Fordyce Letter .
If you 're unsure whether an ad is sincere , you can protect your identity when responding by providing a resume with a post - office box address instead of your home address , says Ms. Dixon .
You might also list just your initials in the document and not your full name .
Further , consider using a disposable email address to prevent spam from clogging up the one you normally use .
If a business address or company name is provided , and it's a name you do n't recognize , search for the employer 's Web site to learn more about it .
You also can check for any complaints filed against it with the Better Business Bureau at bbb.org and consult with people in your network .

Fed Governor Duke Admonishes Bankers
Category Rss Feed - http://www.realestateproarticles.com/rss.php?rss=265
By : John Cutts
In a prepared statement to the American Bankers Association ( ABA ) , Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke called on banks to act more responsibly to prevent another bank - related crisis in the future and to take measures to help slow down foreclosures .
Duke also decried the current affiliation between banks and commercial companies .
She said that their affiliation reduces banks � ability to control credit and exposes banks to risks taken by commercial firms .
According to her , the foreclosure crisis largely emanated from banks � failure to enforce credit controls .
She then called for stricter banking supervision to ensure that banks follow and enforce credit regulations .
Duke was appointed Federal Reserve governor in August 2008 .
She was formerly the chairperson of ABA and was also a top executive at a community bank in Virginia before assuming the central bank leadership .
In a speech in New York City , Governor Duke blamed both the banks and the borrowers for the credit and housing crisis .
While noting that many foreclosure - troubled homeowners should not have borrowed in the first place , she criticized the banks for their failure to check borrowers � ability to pay before providing loans .
Some analysts say that banks are also to be blamed for allowing many borrowers to use risky types of mortgage loans or in other cases , for offering them schemes that enable them to afford the monthly amortizations in the first years .
Some ignored obvious facts that many borrowers could not afford to pay the increased amortizations after the first years .
Duke restated that foreclosures are dragging down macroeconomics and blowing up problems in the financial sector .
The more than 2 million home foreclosures in 2008 should not be allowed to balloon and block the country�s road to recovery .
The governor enumerated ways by which bankers could help troubled borrowers , such as helping them undertake short sales , offering loan modifications that would significantly reduce monthly payments and allowing borrowers to rent their homes as they find remedies or as they wait for foreclosure mitigation measures from Obama�s administration .
In response to calls in Congress for bankers to contribute to the resolution of the foreclosure crisis , giant mortgage lenders such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase committed to offer a three - week suspension of foreclosure proceedings .
The suspension is intended to give troubled borrowers a chance to receive any help from Obama�s foreclosure mitigation program .
The government - controlled mortgage corporations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also committed to extend their foreclosure suspension measures .
John Cutts has been educated in the finer points of the foreclosure market over 5 years .

While there is evidence that estrogenic contaminants are impacting the environment , there is no evidence that oral contraceptives are the main culprit .
And what about the benefits of contraception to the environment ?
The Vatican
recently stated that oral contraceptives are negatively impacting the
environment and male fertility .
Not surprisingly , the Vatican fails to look honestly at the scientific
evidence or at the bigger picture .
It is true that human exposure to chemicals
in our every day environment deserves more attention .
A growing body of scientific
evidence indicates that
chemicals in our environment are negatively affecting male and female
fertility as well as the health of the developing fetus .
More and more
reproductive health , rights and justice organizations , advocates , and health care providers are calling for research that will enhance
our knowledge of this issue and on reforms that will minimize our exposure
to harmful chemicals .
Reproductive Health Technologies Project
is committed to the effort .
But this is an extremely complex issue .
While there is evidence that estrogenic contaminants in the environment
are having a negative impact , there is no evidence that oral contraceptives
are the main culprit .
There are many other estrogenic drugs in
the environment – including hormone replacement and estrogen mimics
that are used for chemotherapy .
In addition , industrial chemicals that
can mimic hormones such as those found in detergents are also estrogenic .
We are aware of only one study that
focuses exclusively on the impact of the specific synthetic estrogen
( 17α - esthinylestradiol , commonly called EE2 ) contained in some oral contraceptives
( many oral contraceptives do not contain EE2 ) .
But in this study ,
EE2 was tested in its " pure " form , not as it is released in a woman’s
urine .
The Vatican ’s effort to disparage contraceptives misses
the larger picture — we need better water treatment systems to get
rid of ALL the chemicals .

Abortion .
Parenthood .

Naturally the Vatican ’s analysis also
fails to acknowledge the benefits of contraception to reproductive health
and the environment .
Most mainstream scientists agree that the
human impact on the environment is the most detrimental .
Contraception
has enabled women and families to decide when and how many children
to have and this in turn has been show to improve the health of children ,
women , communities and the planet .
The Vatican ’s overstatement of
this science is just the most recent twist in their decades - long rejection
of safe , effective modern methods of contraception .
But there is a lot we can and should
do , including :
Passing comprehensive chemical
policy reform in the United States through such legislation as the Kids
Safe Chemical Act
policy reform in the United States through such legislation as the Kids Safe Chemical Act Urging for more research
into the impact of all pharmaceuticals in the environment
into the impact of all pharmaceuticals in the environment Ensuring that waste water
treatment plants use the most effective methods to remove contaminants ;
and
treatment plants use the most effective methods to remove contaminants ; and Supporting " green chemistry "
so that all pharmaceuticals including contraception are safe and effective
while not harming the environment .
We urge the Vatican to join us in these
efforts — efforts that will move us in the direction of protecting
the environment and our fertility .

Tom Cruise took his son , aspiring actor Connor Cruise , 14 , to the Daytona 500 in Florida on Sunday , and posed with him in some cool photos such as the one below :
It was an appropriate setting for the movie star , who looked thrilled to be there .
One of Cruise 's iconic roles , of course , was in the auto racing epic Days of Thunder .

The US Constitution has few friends on the right or the left .
During the first eight years of the 21st century , the Republicans mercilessly assaulted civil liberties .
The brownshirt Bush regime ignored the protections provided by habeas corpus .
They spied on American citizens without warrants .
They violated the First Amendment .
They elevated decisions of the president above US statutory law and international law .
They claimed the power to withhold information from the people ’s representatives in Congress , and they asserted , and behaved as if , they were unaccountable to the people , Congress , and the federal courts .
The executive branch claimed the power to ignore congressional subpoenas .
Republicans regarded Bush as a Stuart king unaccountable to law .
The Bush brownshirt regime revealed itself as lawless , the worst criminal organization in American history .
Now we have the Democrats , and the assault on civil liberty continues .
President Obama does n’t want to hold Bush accountable for his crimes and violations of the Constitution , because Obama wants to retain the powers that Bush asserted .
Even the practice of kidnapping people and transporting them to foreign countries to be tortured has been retained by President Obama .
The civil liberties that Bush stole from us are now in Obama ’s pocket .
Will it turn out that we enjoyed more liberty under Bush than we will under Obama ?
At least the Republicans left us the Second Amendment .
The Obama Democrats are not going to return our other purloined civil liberties , and they are already attacking the Second Amendment .
Rep. Bobby L. Rush ( D , IL ) has introduced the Blair Holt Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 .
As the British and Australians learned , once firearms are registered , the government knows where they are .
The government ’s next step is to confiscate the firearms .
Moreover , the Act would permit the government to negate Second Amendment rights by refusing to issue a license .
Any parents who bequeathed family antique or historic firearms to heirs would be in violation of the act , as it bans any transfer of a firearm other than via a licensed dealer .
William Blackstone , the revered 18th century defender of liberty whose Commentaries on the Laws of England was a bestseller in colonial America , wrote that " the last auxiliary right " of free men is " having arms for their defense . "
Blackstone , England ’s greatest jurist , said that the right to bear arms enables the " natural right of resistance and self - preservation , when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression . "
The Bush regime ’s reversion to medieval methods of incarceration and torture are an indication that we now live in a time " when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression . "
Why do the Democrats desire Americans to be helpless in the face of oppression by the armed state ?
How can it be that Democrats want Americans to be free from the threat of being thrown into dungeons and locked away without a court ever hearing evidence , but are prepared to deny Americans the ability to resist such horrendous treatment should it come their way ?
In response to my question , one progressive acquaintance said that he wanted to reduce " gun violence . "
As guns are inanimate objects , I assume he meant violence committed by people who use guns instead of knives , fists or some other weapon .
" Gun violence " is not something committed by the vast majority of gun owners .
" Gun violence " is the preserve of the criminal elements , such as gangs fighting over drug turf .
Criminals are already prohibited from owning guns , but criminals pay no more attention to this law than they do to laws against robbery , rape , and murder .
Why do Democrats think that disarming law - abiding citizens will disarm outlaws ?
For how many decades have drugs been banned ?
Does any Democrat think that the ban on drugs has succeeded ?
All the ban on drugs has done is to make the drug trade profitable .
Now people fight over it .
How can guns be successfully banned when the war on drugs is a failure ?
All a gun ban would do is to create a new criminal activity .
England , in violation of its unwritten constitution , banned ownership of pistols and rifles .
But now the police have to be heavily armed , because criminals are now armed , but not law - abiding citizens .
When I lived in England , the police were not armed with firearms .
I remember reading a few years after the passage of England ’s gun ban that criminals were selling submachine guns on London street corners .
The police discovered a warehouse in London filled to the brim with machine guns that were being sold to all comers .
So much for gun bans .
They only disarm the law - abiding and leave them defenseless .
Gun bans also greatly increase the crime rate .
When households are armed , robbers prefer houses where no one is home .
In England , criminals are no longer deterred from entering an occupied home .
The more people at home the better .
There might be someone to rape and someone to beat up .
There is little to fear from a disarmed household .
When I lived in the metro area of Washington DC , I resided on the Virginia side of the Potomac .
There was no problem with owning a gun in Virginia , but in DC , until the recent Supreme Court ruling , the only way a person could have a firearm was to keep it disassembled and unloaded .
The Washington " gun control " ordinance benefitted criminals .
The crime rate in DC was much higher than across the river .
Despite , or because of , the gun ban , DC was the murder capital of the US .
Police seldom , if ever , prevent a crime .
Their job is to appear after a crime is committed and to investigate with a view to identifying the perpetrator .
A large number of careful studies show that private gun ownership prevents far more crimes than police ever solve .
Criminals are routinely deterred , apprehended , and sometimes killed , by armed private citizens .
In contrast , police , especially the notorious SWAT teams , accidentally kill more law abiding citizens than they do criminals .
If anyone should be disarmed , it is the police .
When police become militarized , as they increasingly are in the US , their attitude toward the public changes from protective to hostile .
Militarized SWAT teams have established a record of showing up at the wrong address .
In Maryland recently , a SWAT team mistook the mayor and his wife for drug dealers .
A large number of armed men in black , and not identified as police , broke into the mayor ’s home , killed the family ’s Labrador dogs , and held the mayor and his wife spread eagled on the floor with loaded automatic weapons a few inches from their heads .
Fortunately for the mayor and his wife , a local policeman happened by and informed the paramilitary unit that it was the mayor and his wife whom the SWAT team was terrorizing .
Many progressives oppose gun ownership because they have sympathy for animals and oppose hunting .
However , most gun owners are not hunters .
Most members of gun clubs are content to shoot holes in paper targets or at clay pigeons .
They enjoy hand - eye coordination , the study of ballistics , and reloading for antique rifles .
An outing is really just a chance to get together , to talk about history and the load they are working up for their 1873 Winchester , and to enjoy each other ’s company .
There is a vast number of small businesses that exist because of gun ownership .
Repairs , customizing , parts , sights , brass , bullets , primers , and powders for reloading , reloading equipment , targets , cleaning , refinishing , engraving , it goes on and on .
What would happen to these hundreds of thousands of people , to the family businesses and to the skills accumulated , if Americans are deprived of their Second Amendment rights ?
We would have another million people deprived of livelihood and on the streets .
Would they turn to crime ?
The progressive canard is that the Second Amendment , unlike the rest of the amendments to the Constitution , is not a constitutional right for citizens .
Rather it is a right for a defunct organization known as the militia .
Why in the world would the Founding Fathers , when laying out the rights of individuals , confound the point by sticking in among individual rights a right for a military organization ?
But so what if they did .
Americans have had squatter ’ rights to firearms since 1776 .
In 1992 when the Supreme Court revisited Roe v. Wade , the justices acknowledged that the legal argument behind the 1973 decision legitimizing abortion was flawed .
However , the justices ruled that women had exercised abortion rights for 19 years , and the passage of time had given women squatters ’ rights to abortions .
Americans have exercised Second Amendment rights for 234 years .
Regardless of the meaning of the Second Amendment , the right of adverse possession makes gun rights final .
To assault such a well - grounded right is an act of tyranny .

Explanation : Beneath the cold icy surface of Jupiter 's moon Europa are probably the only oceans of water in our Solar System outside of Earth .
These oceans , possibly 50 kilometers deep , might also be the most likely local place to find extra-terrestrial life .
Europa 's smooth surface is unlike any other known planet or moon , giving evidence for relatively few craters or mountains .
Europa was discovered by Galileo and Marius in 1610 .
The NASA spacecraft Galileo is scheduled to arrive at Jupiter in December of 1995 .

Fossil traces found in an oil field on the Arabian Peninsula are the oldest evidence yet of animals , pushing back the known origins of higher life to more than 635 million years ago .
The animals ' remains do n't look like traditional fossils .
They 're more like fossil echoes : chemical traces of a compound only produced — at least in modern times — by demosponges , descendants of what some scientists consider to be the last common ancestor of all animals .
" It is , definitively , the earliest evidence for animals , " said geochemist Gordon Love of the University of California , Riverside , lead author of the study published Wednesday in Nature .
Love 's team identified the fossils while analyzing sedimentary deposits mined by Oman 's national oil company .
The sediments date to the last stages of the the aptly - named Cryogenian period after a deep freeze referred to by scientists as Snowball Earth .
Until now , the oldest animal fossils dated to Earth 's next geological period , called the Ediacaran .
Scientists had been unsure whether they reflected the actual birth of animal life , or merely the beginning of the fossil record .
The new findings show that animals indeed evolved before the Ediacaran , giving these humble sponges at least 100 million years to develop the kaleidoscopic physiologies that bloomed during the early Cambrian period .
" Biologists might argue about which animals diverged first , " said Love , " but regardless of that , we 're certainly looking at very basal animals . "
The telltale sign discovered by Love 's team is a fatty chemical called 24 - isopropylcholestane , which scientists have found only in the skeletal structures of demosponges , the most common member of the sponge family .
Until recently , sponges were believed to be modern descendants of the first animals .
Other recent research suggests that an ancestor of placozoa — an amoebalike creature whose genome was sequenced in 2008 , providing genetic clues of an ancient lineage — was the first animal .
Regardless of this taxonomical controversy , however , Love 's fossils are clearly old .
Both uranium dating and the fossils ' sedimentary position confirm a late - Cryogenian origin .
In a commentary accompanying the findings paleobiologists Jochen Brocks and Nicholas Butterfield raise the possibility that some other organism than a sponge may have left the 24 - isopropylcholestane behind .
Fossil descendents of sponges , they note , have not been found in the Ediacaran or Cambrian periods .
Love , however , called the chemical a paleobiological smoking gun .
" Screening has been done on modern organisms , and there 's only one that produces these in abundance : demosponges , " he said .
" One day , we might come across a microbe , but it has n't happened so far . "
Love next plans to further excavate Cryogenian sediments in order to determine exactly where and when his proto - sponges developed .
" Was it the conditions of the first glaciation that caused a change in biology ? " he said .
" Was it the aftermath , during a change in ocean chemistry ?
We 're trying to understand the context of the first appearance of animals . "

THERE’S MORE LIKE THIS ON OUR NEW SITE – POLANDIAN.COM
Somewhat related to Pawel ’s post below , is it not time for Poland to be considered for its own merits and not just lumped into the increasingly meaningless geographic lump of Central & Eastern Europe ?
I was just listening to Newshour on the BBC World Service where they were busy doom - mongering about Central & Eastern Europe .
Civil unrest , swelling ethnic tensions , falling governments , economic disaster , trashed currencies … it was all there .
It was , however , the usual splattergun approach to news in our part of the world ; throw out a bunch of problems and a list of countries and leave everyone with the assumption that all listed countries have all the named problems .
Poland was mentioned in the programme but I ’ve already forgotten why , ca n’t have been serious , whereas Latvia , well , you may as well close the country !
The questions were best described as ‘ very leading ’ and with an agenda of “ We all want to believe that CEE is screwed so why do n’t you , Mr Expert , just confirm it ” .
Mr Expert did n’t actually confirm anything beyond the fact that a few countries have over - borrowed and might have problems .
Poland was n’t one of them and yet those who simply listen to and react to ill informed , sensationalist headlines and reports might be excused for assuming Poland is now on the brink of total collapse .
I ’m convinced that a lot of the current bad press is nothing more than green - eyed jealousy .
This country enjoyed , and may still be enjoying , a period of strong growth .
It is , possibly , being less affected by the munch - crunch - recession - depression - slump - crisis than other countries .
Our citizens took advantage of the UK while the times were good and may well be moving back now the tide has turned .
This country is not , yet , suffering quite as much as others , nor does it have 2 trillion GBP mountain of debt , the worse since the 50’s .
So , is there just a touch of jealousy here ?
If others are having a bad time then it would only be right for us to suffer as well ?
Tired of talking about their own desperate problems they have to find a new donkey to kick ?
I ’m all for people reporting on Poland and even highlighting its problems , whatever they may be , but let ’s please keep it specific to Poland .
What I do n’t like is people suggesting that Poland , Latvia , Ukraine , Hungary , Romania et al. are essentially one big country where everyone has the same problems !
How would the UK like it if we just started referring to them as Western Europe and drawing no distinctions between them and Holland , France , Germany , Belgium , Norway and Spain ?
How would the USA like to be lumped in with Cuba , Mexico , Canada and Venezuela under a heading of The Americas ?
So , let ’s please start a campaign against geographical discrimination and stop using this ridiculous heading of Central & Eastern Europe .
Even Wikipedia , fast becoming the font of all wisdom , fails to provide a clear definition ;
Central Europe is the region lying between the variously and vaguely defined areas of Eastern and Western Europe .
In addition , Northern , Southern and Southeastern Europe may variously delimit or overlap into Central Europe .
Their map of the region includes the usual suspects – Poland , Hungary , Czech , Slovakia , Slovenia & Austria but adds Liechtenstein , Germany and Switzerland whilst sitting on the fence about Croatia and Romania .
Here are just a few more reasons why we should hang , draw and quarter the phrase ‘ Central & Eastern Europe ’ :
Austria .
Austria is as related to Central Europe as it is to China .
It does not share the communist history .
The attitude of its citizens is not even close to any I ’ve met in CE .
The only link it has to CE is that it pretended to be the “ Gateway to Central Europe ” for a year or two shortly after the iron curtain fell .
Austria should bog off and be Austrian !
Definition .
Ask 100 people to tell you which countries are in Central or Eastern Europe and you ’ll get at least 95 different answers .
Eastern Europe .
To my mind these are the countries that retain stronger ties to Russia .
These might be trading , language , alphabet , mental attitude or all of the above .
This might include Ukraine , Belarus and a bunch of places ending in ‘ stan ’ , then again , it might not .
Who knows ?
This is a meaningless geographic grouping within the even less meaningful grouping of CEE .
Croatia .
I ’ve been there , it feels more like ‘ Venice by the sea ’ than Warsaw or Prague .
Surely this , along with Bulgaria ( also often lumped into a CE definition ) would be better defined as part of ‘ The Balkans ’ rather than CE ?
Romania .
Strange place .
Cornered the market for dead dogs .
Stole Transylvania from Hungary ( as I am always reminded by the Hungarians ) but can it possibly be a part of CE ?
From my work point of view I ’m tempted to allow Romania in , but it ’s a close call .
Germany , Liechtenstein & Switzerland .
Someone ’s having a laugh , right ?!
Do you notice Latvia / Estonia / Lithuania on that Wikipedia map ?
No , because those are best known as the Baltic States .
So why was the BBC banging on about Latvia in a programme about the problems that Central Europe has ?
Need I go on ?
I ’m not sure which , if any other nation Poles would be happy to be associated with but to me , the use of an all encompassing “ Central & Eastern Europe ” is about as insulting as defining everyone with slanted eyes as a chink , Barak Obama as a brown man or everyone from Britain as a Paki .
The other day someone said to me , " Well , those folks just think you are a person who has M.S. and just wo n't accept it . "
Even though two different neurologists , after reviewing all of my records and thoroughly examining me , told me they do not believe I have M.S. , some people ( how many of you are out there ? ) along with our government still find it easier to think that I am avoiding the inevitable truth of my " MS diagnosis " by blaming it on the artificial sweetener aspartame .
I wonder how they would feel if they watched a member of their family who , though not allergic to phenylalanine ( like Phenylketonurics ) , suffered debilitating effects from consuming too much aspartame ?
Not only has my life been changed by aspartame in ways that are apparently never going to be reversed ( my eyesight and my memory ) but recently I had a very hard time acquiring health insurance .
The insurance underwriter actually told my insurance agent that he ran across 6,000 cases like mine ( people claiming aspartame made them sick ) a month .
Now I do not know how many people his location underwrites in a month , whether he meant 6,000 people a year , whether he was exaggerating or even whether my agent was being honest with me .
It is just one more piece of my aspartame story and one more way it has left it 's ugly mark on my life .
Now I know this is America and I am ultimately in charge of where I end up in life , but why , when we have a system in place to protect people , does that very system seem so hell bent on writing off aspartame victims as unreliable at the possible cost of more injuries ?
I do understand that many people go about their lives ingesting aspartame without any resulting negative symptoms .
So they believe .
I wonder if they ever have moments of mental confusion ( " Oh I am just so busy that I can't concentrate . " ) , numbness and tingling ( " Goodness my foot 's asleep again . " ) or have weight they just can't seem to drop , ( " Hand me another Diet Coke . " ) , or other symptoms .
How many people are suffering and have no idea it could be from the artificial sweetener aspartame ?
I found it almost comical when my first neurologist said to me after my completely normal exam ( after about a week off of aspartame ) , " I get people in here all of the time complaining of symptoms like yours and their CT scans are normal too . "
Still , none of this is scientific evidence of people suffering harm from aspartame and the studies that have been done have been discredited or ignored .
Which leads me to more laughter as the studies the FDA used for approval have been shown by some in the scientific community to have serious flaws .
You see it depends on which side of the fence you sit on as to whether or not you believe one study over another .
But for me , I know what aspartame did and I do not need to prove it .
I only want to protect others from possible harm and want to be heard by my government .
My neurologist mentioned to me that the only way to give any " scientific credibility " to my claim that I was harmed by aspartame ( through drinking about 8 Crystal Light Lemonade 's per day plus chewing gum and ingesting other sugar free foods ) would be to put me back on it and see what happens .
I would never ever do that .
I do n't need to .
I have always felt bad from drinking Diet Coke .
In college I used to grab a Big Gulp at 7 am and by 7:30 am I would have a head ache and my whole body would feel fuzzy and sluggish .
I realized I could not drink Diet Coke and switched to Splenda as soon as it was available .
I no longer knowingly ingest any artificial sweeteners .
I talk to people frequently who have stopped drinking diet sodas and tell me how much better they feel .
It took me about three days without aspartame ( I was too sick to drive myself to the store to buy the Crystal Light I had recently become enamored with ) to begin to feel better .
Still , I believe one of the main reason the government gets away with not revisiting the approval of aspartame is because it does not affect everyone in the same , measurable ways .
I believe it may not affect some at all .
Yet apparently aspartame is not a good thing for pregnant women to ingest per the FDA .
Has anyone told them ?
Are there warnings listed anywhere ?
" During pregnancy , high maternal levels of blood phenylalanine can be transferred to the fetus and produce serious adverse effects on brain development . "
FDA website .
Scientists are studying the impact that genetic and nutritional predisposition have in relation to disease and toxins in our lives .
New research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health with support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) is just beginning .
Early indicators of the impact of environmental pollution on conditions such as autism , asthma , cerebral palsy , diabetes , and attention deficit disorder could begin to be available in three to five years .
I think this research will lead to more understanding as to why some people react badly to things such as aspartame while others do not , just as some smokers get lung cancer and some do not .
New research may show us that it is things such as undiscovered mitochondrial disease or too little folic acid in some people that leaves them susceptible to aspartame and other toxins .
Sadly , I do not think we have time to wait for the results before we act as a government to remove aspartame from our food and drink supply or to place warning labels on foods containing aspartame .
According to the Aspartame Information Center ( which according to Source Watch is a non-profit group " representing the low - calorie and reduced - fat food and beverage industry ) , aspartame is " found in more than 6,000 products including carbonated soft drinks , powdered soft drinks , chewing gum , confections , gelatins , dessert mixes , puddings and fillings , frozen desserts , yogurt , tabletop sweeteners , and some pharmaceuticals such as vitamins and sugar - free cough drops . "
As you can see , the industry loves to tout that it is in everything .
I see children being given products containing aspartame and it makes cringe .
How do we know that , although they are not allergic to phenylalanine , they could have a sensitivity to it which leaves them open to various reactions .
Especially at the high levels of today 's consumption .
" An average aspartame - sweetened beverage would have a conservative aspartame content of about 555 mg / liter48 , and therefore , a methanol equivalent of 56 mg / liter ( 56 ppm ) .
For example , if a 25 kg child consumed on a warm day , after exercising , two - thirds of a two - liter bottle of soft drink sweetened with aspartame , that child would be consuming over 732 mg of aspartame ( 29 mg/kg ) .
This alone exceeds what the Food and Drug Administration considers the 99 + percentile daily consumption level of aspartame .
The child would also absorb over 70 mg of methanol from that soft drink .
This is almost ten times the Environmental Protection Agency 's recommended daily limit of consumption for methanol . "

There are those of us who can tell you that the evidence exists , based upon our experiences , that health can be adversely affected by aspartame even if you are not a Phenylketonuric .
Why is it so hard for the FDA to simply listen with an ear open to safety , yet so easy for them to classify aspartame victims as those " aspartame opponents who are just into internet junk science " ?
Could so many of our citizens be so wrong about their own experiences with aspartame ?
How our negative experiences with aspartame be considered invalid by the one organization that we ourselves have put in place to protect us ?
Have I given up my rights to be heard and to be able to call to action senators and others to protect a segment of our population which is sensitive to aspartame simply because what I claim , I claim on the Internet ?
" Websites with screaming headlines and well - written text attempt to link aspartame consumption to systemic lupus , multiple sclerosis , vision problems , headaches , fatigue , and even Alzheimer 's disease . "
FDA website .
I do not ATTEMPT to link aspartame consumption to vision problems , fatigue ( that 's putting it mildly ) , misdiagnosed MS and other frightening symptoms .
In my life , a link exists .
I had to figure that out on my own through a very frightening and still troublesome incident .
Why was there absolutely no consumer protection in place for me and others who have suffered from aspartame ?
Where were the warnings from the FDA ?
Who is going to protect the citizens of the US from harmful food additives if our own government wo n't ?
It is time for the US Government to wake up , get informed and start protecting its citizens from the harmful and very real effects of aspartame .
Campaigners today lost their High Court challenge over the Government 's eco-towns project , but vowed to carry on their protest .
A judge rejected their complaint that there had been a failure to consult the public properly over the policy to build " environmentally - friendly " towns to meet housing shortages .
Mr Justice Walker , sitting at the High Court in London , stressed the project was " at a relatively early stage " and there would be future opportunities for consultation .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
He ruled the Government had not followed unlawful procedures or attempted to " outflank " the planning system .
He also rejected accusations that it had proceeded with " a closed mind " .
The failed legal challenge was spearheaded by the Better Accessible Responsible Development ( Bard ) campaign , which is opposed to 6,000 new homes being built near Long Marston , Warwickshire , 10 miles south of Stratford - upon - Avon .
The group , formed by residents from across Warwickshire , Worcestershire and Gloucestershire , believe the scheme could cause " irreparable damage to this beautiful part of middle England " .
Bard was joined in the application for judicial review by Weston Front , a group fighting proposals for the Weston Otmoor eco-town in Oxfordshire where there are plans for 15,000 new homes .
Their counsel described the plans as " a ghastly shadow " hanging over their lives .
A third pressure group , CASCET , which is against plans for the Pennbury eco-town in Leicestershire , put forward formal submissions to the High Court in support of Bard 's application .
The Government announced a shortlist of potential sites last April in its consultation document Eco-Towns : Living A Greener Future .
But the protesters said the consultation process conducted so far " was bound to inspire cynicism and concern " and there should be fuller consideration of the views of local residents , including on whether eco - towns were in principle the best way to tackle housing shortages .

David Bliss , chairman of the Bard campaign , said after the ruling : " We are disappointed but this is by no means the end of the road for Bard 's challenges to the Middle Quinton proposal .
" Labelling objectors Nimbies ( Not in My Back Yard ) is a lazy government response to a well thought out opposition to the current eco-town programme .
" No less than 47 national , regional and local representative bodies agree that poorly - sited new towns will neither meet their promised eco-agenda nor provide affordable housing in places where people want to live . "
Mr Bliss added : " Our principle remains compelling - local people deserve to be properly consulted on government policies that directly impact them .
" Contrary to government assertions , we care deeply both about the environment and our communities .
" Experience from Europe suggests that the way to success is developing eco-quarters as part of urban extensions rather than building new towns in isolated rural spots and expecting them to be environmentally friendly solutions to the housing demand . "
Mr Bliss said : " In short , poorly - sited eco - towns will lead to soulless commuter - based dormitory towns becoming expensive white elephants of the future .
We do not intend to stand by and watch this happen .
" Despite today 's ruling we hope the government will listen to local people and their democratically elected representatives before progressing with the programme . "
Housing Minister Margaret Beckett welcomed the court 's ruling .
She described eco-towns as " a unique opportunity to deliver much - needed affordable housing , built in a way which , by incorporating the very latest energy - saving techniques , benefits both residents and the wider community " .
Ms Beckett said : " I am pleased the judge has recognised the Government has acted properly and dismissed the review on all grounds .
" Several local authorities are working with us on potential eco-towns and our second consultation , on both the shortlist of locations and our proposed standards , remains open .
" Once we have identified a final shortlist of potential locations , developers will need to go through the local planning process - giving people a third opportunity to have their say . "

Zambian President Rupiah Banda has said Zambia supports the idea of forming the United States of Africa which aims at enhancing peace and unity on the Africa continent , Zambia News and Information Services ( ZANIS ) reported on Saturday .
Speaking Saturday at the Lusaka International Airport shortly before departure for Addis Ababa , Ethiopia to attend the 12th African Union heads of state and government summit , President Banda said his government would support the formation of the United States of Africa .
He said since Zambia is a member of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , it will support efforts of the SADC organ to implement the United States of Africa .
Banda said the idea of the United States of Africa is to foster unity , peace , security and enhance economic development on the continent .
Meanwhile , President Banda expressed happiness at the manner the Zimbabwe ruling ZANU - PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) are resolving their political differences in the country , according to ZANIS .
Banda said he is overwhelmed to see the two political parties working towards forming a government of national unity , a move he said will end the political impasse in neighbouring Zimbabwe .
He said the Zambian government will support all efforts meant to resolve political differences in that country especially that Zambia has a lot to share with Zimbabwe .

I love this ~
This verse is perfect for this , I had to look up something related to being persecuted and I came across this :
Matthew 5:43 - 45
“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy . ’
“ But I say to you , love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you ... "

I try to avoid words like “ hateful ass ” when speaking of the Pope .
He ’s not my pope , but he is somebody ’s .
And , in spite of my differences with the Catholic church leadership over “ minor ” issues like pedophilia ( I ’m against it ) , I try to live and let live .

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - NASA moved space shuttle Discovery to its launch pad on Wednesday for a planned February 12 launch that will kick off the U.S. space agency ’s last full year of shuttle missions before the fleet is retired in 2010 .
Five trips to the International Space Station are scheduled for this year , along with a final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope .
The space station , a $ 100 billion project of 16 nations , is nearing completion after more than a decade of construction .
Discovery and a crew of seven will deliver and install the last of the U.S. - built solar wing panels and radiators , which are needed to bring the orbital complex up to full power .
The panels are folded up inside a 45 - foot - ( 14 - meter ) long , 15 - tonne aluminum girder that completes the station ’s exterior backbone .
Riding atop a slow - moving Apollo - era transport system , the shuttle ’s trek to the launch pad began before sunrise on Wednesday .
The 3.4 - mile ( 5.5 - km ) journey took about six hours .
Discovery ’s crew plans to climb aboard the shuttle at its seaside launch pad in central Florida for a final dress rehearsal before the scheduled blastoff .
The crew includes Japan ’s Koichi Wakata , who will become the first from his country to live aboard the outpost .
He replaces NASA astronaut Sandra Magnus , who has been one of the station ’s flight engineers since mid-November .
Fatah 's military wing , al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigade , took responsibility for firing the rockets Sunday morning into the western Negev .
One of the rockets landed next to a pre-school in Eshkol Regional Council .

BEYOND PARODY ….
Over the weekend , “ Saturday Night Live ” had a skit showing Republican officials scheming against President Obama .
The GOP , of course , was made to look ridiculous — mocking the president ’s substantive answers to questions , arguing over whether Limbaugh or Hannity is the “ smartest man in America , ” and debating whether they should pursue impeachment now or in April .
As is often the case , the line between Republican satire and Republican reality is often blurred — some of the president ’s GOP detractors really are nuts .
( via Mahablog )
Four Tennessee state representatives , all Republicans , have signed up to be plaintiffs in a lawsuit against President Barack Obama , aimed at forcing him to prove he is a United States citizen by coughing up his birth certificate .
Let me just say what all the world is now thinking , including their fellow Republicans on the Hill :
This is dumber than a box of rocks .
Tennessee Reps. Eric Swafford , Stacey Campfield , Glen Casada and Frank Nicely now have a giant “ G ” on their foreheads for “ Gullible . ”
The four were so willing to drink the craziest flavor of Kool - Aid , they ’ve gotten themselves caught up in a national urban legend that has been thoroughly debunked .
What ’s next ?
A resolution honoring the Easter Bunny for doing such a great job with the annual colored egg delivery system ?
A proposed law asking these four to prove they have a brain ?
Apparently , some yahoo in California is filing another lawsuit challenging Obama ’s presidential eligibility .
Some Republican lawmakers in the Volunteer State , including the GOP caucus chairman of the Tennessee House , are using their positions to not only endorse the baseless case , but also pledging to be plaintiffs in the litigation .
It seems a little early in Obama ’s presidency to see Republicans become this deranged .
I shudder to think how unhinged they ’ll be in , say , a year .
( Newser ) – It does n't pay to be a hero , sometimes .
A McDonald 's employee who stepped in to prevent a man from beating up a woman in the restaurant got shot multiple times and ended up with $ 300,000 in medical bills .
Now McDonald 's says it 's wo n't pay up because his injuries " did not arise out of or within the course and scope of his employment , " the Arkansas Times reports .
Nigel Haskett , 22 , has filed a workers ' comp complaint .
His lawyer says McDonald 's is apparently sticking by company policy that it lays out for workers :
Do n't be hero , call 911 .
But even the judge handling the trial of Haskett 's assailant singled him out in court .
" Here is this young man working for minimum wage , coming to the aid of a woman , " he said , before donating $ 100 to a fund set up on Haskett 's behalf .

A baby born 10 weeks prematurely needs constant monitoring Premature births cost the UK an extra £ 939 m a year , say researchers at the Oxford Centre for Health Economics .
Their study calculated what the costs would be for all the preterm babies born in 2006 over the first 18 years of their life .
They looked at healthcare , education and the costs to their parents of having to have more time off work .
And they say that more funding for research into ways to delay premature births could save £ 260 m a year .
The baby charity , Tommy's , which funded the research , says this is the first study to look at the total cost to the public purse .
The extent to which the costs associated with preterm birth are an economic burden has previously received little attention
Prof Peter Brocklehurst ,
Oxford University Perinatal Epidemiology Unit Jane Brewin , Tommy 's chief executive said : " Given that the UK rate of premature birth is rising , this mammoth cost is set to grow even larger . "
She said better neonatal care had improved the likelihood of these babies surviving but they still faced considerable difficulties .
" We know that there are serious implications for some of these babies such as chronic lung disease , haemorrhaging in the brain , eye problems , digestive tract problems and increased risk of infection . "
Calculating costs
The study , published in the US journal , Pediatrics , shows the researchers assigned a probability and cost to possible outcomes including the need for neonatal care , mild disability , moderate disability , severe disability and death .
They calculated that 66.4 % of the total cost is incurred by those born only moderately prematurely between 33 - 36 weeks .
And almost all the extra costs come from when premature babies are in hospital just after birth .
KEY FINDINGS
Cost of premature birth to the UK is £ 939 m per year Cost of average preterm baby is one and a half times more than a baby born full term Delaying all premature births by just one week could save £ 260 m per year A similar study in the US produced very similar results .
Professor Peter Brocklehurst , director of the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at Oxford University , said : " The extent to which the costs associated with preterm birth are an economic burden has previously received little attention .
" We propose that more effort is focused on preventing preterm birth . "
New research Tommy's is funding three medical research centres that are investigating the cause of premature birth , miscarriage and stillbirth .
Jane Brewin said : " The vital work that Tommy 's is funding searches for proteins circulating in the mother 's blood in early pregnancy which will highlight which women will develop pre-eclampsia .
" This will then enable early treatment to prolong the pregnancy and improve the chances for mother and baby .
" We are also detailing the events which control uterine contractions so we could intervene to stop them in pre-term labour .
" Current treatments are ineffective at delaying labour by more than a couple of days , however we believe if we could improve that to a week it may make a significant difference to the health of the baby . "
Valued babies Andy Cole , of the special care baby charity , Bliss , said : " There are many reasons why children need help and support in their early years and to suggest that premature babies are a financial burden on society is entirely unjustified .
" We cannot and should not judge a life by an economic metric .
" It is important to remember that premature babies , like all babies , are individuals and will be loved and valued by their families . "
A Department of Health spokesperson said : " We have established a taskforce , chaired by Professor Sir Bruce Keogh , to support the NHS to identify and deliver real improvements to neonatal services .
" The government recognises the importance of gaining improved understanding and prevention of the trigger factors that are associated with preterm birth .
" The department is undertaking work that will help us identify gaps in research and highlight areas where further research is required . "

THE UN’S nuclear watchdog has reported that Iran has managed to produce a tonne of low - enriched uranium , which it says is enough to build a nuclear weapon .
International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) officials cautioned that there remained many obstacles to the production of a bomb , and yesterday ’s report said Iran appeared to have slowed down the rate at which it is expanding its uranium enrichment capacity .
But the report is likely to raise the already high tensions surrounding Iran ’s nuclear programme .
One US analyst said that the one - tonne milestone meant Iran had reached “ breakout capacity ” – the theoretical ability to produce the 20 - 25kg of highly enriched uranium needed for one warhead .
Others were more cautious , but said there was plenty more matters in the report to raise the level of international concern .
The IAEA said that Iran had put a roof on a heavy water nuclear reactor being built near the town of Arak , and is preventing the agency from carrying out inspections , meaning they no longer had any way of seeing what was being done inside .
Iran is also refusing to tell the IAEA where it is manufacturing the centrifuges used to enrich uranium , so the agency cannot confirm how many are being produced .
In a separate report released yesterday , the IAEA said traces of uranium taken from the site of an alleged nuclear reactor in Syria were man-made , and rejected the Syrian government ’s claim that the uranium had come from Israeli missiles used to destroy the site in 2007 .
The report denounces Damascus for its lack of co-operation with the IAEA .
Together , the reports appear to bring closer the possibility of a military confrontation with Israel , which has said it will not tolerate a nuclear - armed Iran .
The IAEA report on Iran surprised many proliferation experts because it recorded a dramatic jump in Iranian stockpiles of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) at the enrichment plant at Natanz .
In its last report in November , the IAEA estimated that Iran had produced 635 kg of LEU .
“ Do they have enough LEU to produce a significant quantity of HEU [ enough for a bomb ] ?
Yes , if you count the U235 atoms then they do have a significant quantity , ” an official close to the IAEA said .
“ But it is theoretical and they would need to use their full capacity .
They are not there yet .
If they were to build another clandestine facility , then that would be different . ”
David Albright , a veteran UN weapons inspector , who now heads the independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington , gave a blunter assessment : “ They have reached a nuclear weapons breakout capability .
You can dance about it , but they would have enough to make 20 - 25 kg of weapons grade HEU , ” he said .
“ If they break out they will do it at a clandestine facility , not at Natanz , so you ca n’t use Natanz as a measure of how fast they could do it . ”
Mike Patton 's alternative metal giants have confirmed they are re-forming for the first time in 10 years
Faith No More are to reunite , Mike Patton has announced .
Only he 's not making much of a fuss about it .
Last year 's rumours were confirmed in a statement released this week by Patton 's publicist .
Buried at the end of a long blurb about Crank 2 : High Voltage – a film of great interest to everyone , we 're certain – is news to stop the hearts of impatient Faith No More fans .
" [ Patton 's ] upcoming schedule includes a performance with labelmates Zu , " the statement reads , " the Coachella [ festival ] with Rahzel ... and the highly anticipated reunion tour with Faith No More in Europe this summer . "
Patton 's alternative metal band have not released any music since 1997's Album of the Year and have not performed together since 1998 .
Though fans have spent the last decade pushing for a reunion , tensions between former bandmates – and Patton 's cavalcade of other projects – have prevented this dream from becoming a reality .
In a way , this offhand reference is the most appropriate place for a reunion announcement .
Patton 's mixed - up priorities were blamed for Faith No More 's dissolution , and it seems fitting that their reunion should in turn be a distraction from projects like , er , the Crank 2 : High Voltage soundtrack .
Recorded in Los Angeles last year , the Crank 2 soundtrack is Patton 's first foray into feature - length film scores , having previously composed the music to the short film A Perfect Place .
It will be released 17 April .

Sharing the load between servers - httpd and Tomcat
If you 're running a lot of traffic through an application , it 's possible that one web server can't cope ... not so much because of the traffic levels , but because oomph the computer .
Customer 's applications range from financial to transport planning .
The amount of compute behind the calculation of a Melksham to Altnabreac train journey schedule is large , even if the result is a tiny report .
Now you 'll want to quote your customer a single URL , wo n't you , to process all your traffic , and you 'll want to save yourself the £ 40,000 cost of a hardware load balancer .
OK ... Scheme :
• A single server running Apache httpd forwarding the hard work to ...
• A whole batch of Apache Tomcat servers ( if your application is in Java ) which are doing all the compute and working out that you need to change at Chippenham , Paddington , Euston and Inverness !
You can do this very nicely , and the modern way of connecting the two servers is using mod_proxy_balancer .
It 's supplied with httpd ( no need to source it extra and build it ) and it's powerful and works well once you 've come to terms with the various configuration options .
But then here comes the ' sting in the tail ' .
" What does a RETURN ticket cost " comes back a follow up request , and you need to ensure that your visitor is either routed to the same server as he was on before or that the server he gets send to may be a different one , but is aware of the enquiry he is continuing .
The first of these approaches ( load balancing ) is far easier and lower cost in terms of resources than the latter ( clustering ) which , however , is far more robust in the unlikely event of a Tomcat server going off - line .
There are a number of actions that need to be taken in the configuration of your system to ensure that users DO get routed back to the same server if you take the balance approach :
1 . You need to declare a sticky cookie at the Apache httpd mod_proxy_balancer
2 . You need to set a jvmroute at the Apache Tomcat
3 . Your programmer needs to set up a Session at Your Servlet
and perhaps
4 . You need to set up a Reverse Cookie Path .
We 've put all this lot in a training example ... and the example we chose was a front end server that receives guests and sends each newly arrived one to a randomly selected put for a drink , but on subsequent visits sends then back to the same pub , secure in the knowledge that they 'll feel comfortable and an home there , and will be known to the barman .
Here are the sample files :
The important bit in the httpd.conf configuration file for Apache httpd
< Proxy balancer :// barcrawl >
Balancermember ajp://192.168.200.218:8189/bar
Balancermember ajp://192.168.200.214:8189/bar
Balancermember ajp://192.168.200.219:8189/bar
Balancermember ajp://192.168.200.210:8333/bar
Balancermember ajp://192.168.200.215:8189/bar
ProxySet lbmethod=bytraffic
ProxySet stickysession=JSESSIONID
</ Proxy >
ProxyPass / bar balancer :// barcrawl/
ProxyPassReverseCookiePath / bar / bar
The setting up of the server route in the configuration file for Apache Tomcat - server.xml :
< Engine name = " Catalina " defaultHost =" localhost " jvmRoute = " elm " >
And here are the pertinent lines from within our Barman application , each copy of which has been altered to welcome the visitor to a different pub :
HttpSession session = request.getSession ( true ) ;
out. print ( " < h1 > Welcome .
Please enter your name </ h1 > " ) ;
out .
print ( " You are in the King Billy < br > " ) ;
We 'll train you on setting up Apache httpd and Tomcat on our Deploying Apache httpd and Tomcat course ( but please let us know when you book if you 're particularly interested in load balancing and / or clustering and we may suggest an extra day .
And we 'll train you on Java Programming on our Java Bootcamp if you 're already a programmer , or on learning to program in Java if you 're a programming novice .

Invoker and cgi servlets on Tomcat 6
Related topics : via article database More about Graham Ellis of Well House Consultants
If you want to use the Invoker or cgi servlets on Tomcat 6 , you need to change the privileged setting in the conf / context.xml file - change :
< Context >
to
< Context reloadable =" true " privileged =" true " >
If you simply uncomment the Invoker and cgi sections of the web.xml file without making these changes , you 'll break Tomcat completely and even the other servlets wo n't work - you 'll just get a blank page when you browse to the site .
There is no longer any need ( as there was at Tomcat 5.5 and previously ) to rename jar files for the cgi and ssi servlets to work .

Train and Coach fares from London ( and airports ) to Melksham
Related topics : via article database
Advise on travel to Melksham for training course customers arriving via London .
The advise is good for people coming to Melksham to visit other businesses too ...
If you fly into London 's Heathrow airport , the best way to Melksham would actually be by express coach [ bus ] rather than by train as it would save you having to go into and out of the centre of London - there 's a coach at 18:45 from Heathrow that passes right by our training centre and stops about 500 metres away , and it takes just over 2 hours .
It returns from Melksham to Heathrow at 07:45 each morning .
The standard return fare is 27.40 ( twenty seven pounds 40 p ) return .
From Central London , the train [ outside the peak hours , when they more than double ] costs 45 pounds return - make sure you get a return ticket , because a one way ticket costs just a pound less .
And that 's to Melksham ( with very few services ) or to Chippenham - 8 km away .
If you arrived in a different airport ( London also has airports at Stansted and Gatwick ) , you would transfer by train and it would cost rather more as they are both on the other side of London - the off peak return from Stansted is 56 pounds , and from Gatwick it 's 53 pounds .
Extra notes :
If you get the train to Chippenham , there 's a local bus service to Melksham that calls at the station during the evenings only , or you could get a taxi ( allow just under 20 pounds ) .
If you are on a Well House Consultants course or staying at Well House Manor , we may be able to arrange a lift or have a taxi from Melksham there to meet you .
If you 're arriving into Heathrow at other times of day , it 's still easier to catch the coach than the train , but to Chippenham where the bus will drop you off right beside the taxi rank .

Web Site Loading - experiences and some solutions shared
Related topics : via article database
I can recall a colleague of mine ( OK , if you 're reading this Peter , yes you were the boss ) using the term " Open Kimono " to describe certain approaches at certain times , and ( truth be told ) I was n't sure if there was something a little naughty in the connotations that the term conjured up .
Yet the term came back to me this morning when I was wondering whether to post up some recent experiences / comments from the growth curve we have been seeing in resource usage on our web server .
But I think I 'm OK to use the term ... the My Open Kimono Blog uses it , for example .
Why move the web site ?
Here goes .
We moved our main domain to a dedicated server six months ago .
Traffic levels were such that our daily Apache httpd logs on a shared server in the USA were around 15 Mbytes each , and we had concerns at the lag time taken for traffic from the UK ( our primary market ) to make the round trip .
We were also concerned that search engines were seeing us , with a " .net " top level domain , as being located and trading in the country in which our server was located rather than in the UK .
And we had some security concerns with regard to the peaky load that others were putting on the server , and the possibility of PHP injection attacks into our scripts by others on the machine ( or , rather , due to loopholes left by others sharing the system - see here )
The first problem , and a warning sign
Anyway ... a few of the teething troubles that were only to be expected as we learned out way into the new server , and the web site was transferred and live in a quite remarkably short time .
But then it died in the middle of one night .
And that technical story is told here .
Finding an issue like this is rather like looking for a needle in a lot of hay - not even in a single haystack , as the potential issues are many any varied , and there can be just the one trigger .
But there was a serious latent issue .
How could a single script 's running - even if it caused 20 seconds of cpu time to be burned up , cause an ongoing problem , as it appeared to have done when it ran that night ?
The Current Issue
Traffic has now risen ; from a 15 Mbyte daily log file in July , traffic has risen in less that 6 months to peak at nearly 50 Mbytes per day ... and we have seen other occasions when the server 's queue length as reported by uptime - usually between 0.2 and 0.8 - has swept majestically upwards to 40 , 50 or more and has stuck there .
A temporary cure has proven to be easy enough - just a stop of the httpd and mysql daemons , then a restart and the whole thing has started purring along sweetly until the next time .
So have httpd and / or MySQL been stuck in some sort of loop ?
No - I do n't think so .
I think we have simply filled up the server 's memory and it's been running on the backup of ' swap space ' , with more processes / threads of httpd and MySQL than can fit in the real memory fighting for that space , and with the disk ' thrashing ' about .
And more requests will be joining the queue , now quicker than completed ones are being peeled off .
In other words , it 's a self perpetuating problem which , once it has started to occur , is likely to get progressively worse .
Unlike a bus queue where you can see you 've got a wait ... pop off and get a coffee and come back a bit later ... you have no such option on a web server ...
... and in effect it 's made worse by the driver of each and every bus having to stop and re-organise the queue on every trip , thus cutting down the capacity for the queue to be handled at the very time it 's most needed !
Evidence
What evidence do I have that it 's pure load rather than one particular script ?
Well - the problem was triggering just after 6 a.m. in the morning , on some mornings - and that 's the time an extra load ( a server backup ) gets added on to the job queue - actually several jobs , including a database dump and some tars .
Each runs perfectly well manually , at a quiet time , but if the server happens to be busy they 'll start popping it in to an unrecoverable overdrive .
And then the problem triggered , it seemed , at around lunchtime and again between 4:30 and 6:00 in the afternoon - the busiest times on our server , with the UK and European traffic heavy just after noon , and then the UK traffic still very busy at the time the USA traffic was picking up too towards then end of the afternoon / early evening .
And Saturdays and Sundays , when our servers are notably quieter , it ran sweetly ( this gave me false hope as I tried to fix the issues at the weekend ! )
There 's a technical article here in which I show a top report comparing our server when well behaved and when thrashing .
Possible Solutions
More buses , more efficient buses , and taking measures to turn the very occasional person away when the queue is starting to get to the " needs marshalling " stage .
We can also make sure that everyone in the queue really wants to travel !
How do those work in web server terms ?
• More buses .
For the moment , let 's put that one on the back burner .
We could cross the palms of our WSP with more silver each month , but there 's little point in purchasing something that 's not needed .
• More efficient buses .
If we can get the buses to run trips more quickly , the same number of buses will handle more customers and will stop the queue bursting .
There are quite significant elements of PHP in most of our pages , and quite a bit of MySQL too - indeed , most of our images are fed from a database .
I have reduced bookkeeping operations in our scripts so that they 're run not on every page , but only randomly on around one page in five .
A few excess records in " what happened in the last quarter hour " really do n't matter .
Various other smaller actions .
And the big one - I have added an index based on the URL to our 15,000 page stats database that we use to provide the relative importance map for Google , and the Google - like search results on our resources pages .
It 's probably significant that some of the problems only started to occur at around the time that these extra databases started to be collected ! [ detail ]
• Fast track service desks
I have taken about a dozen images which are served several times each served very frequently indeed and moved them to plain files , rather than serving them via PHP and MySQL .
• Limiting the queue
I do n't want to turn people away - in fact I HATE doing it - but a very few dropped connections from time to time is far , far better that having the whole queue come to a screaming halt until the server 's heartbeat is missed on our monitoring machine which screams for the administrator .
I have tuned our queues ... and there is a technical article that I 've added to the site here that tells you about how I 've done that .
• Restricting to really wanted travellers
You may recall articles about libwww and Babycaleb earlier on this blog .
This sort of traffic , generated by automata , is very peaky and ( in the case of the examples quoted ) totally unwanted .. the articles linked just above tell you how I have turned away a great deal of that traffic at the front door , and how I have ensured that much of the rest of it is " fast track "ed as above .
• Cutting out needless journeys
Do you like this picture of Charlie , our cat , who 's in the habit of coming up to say " good morning " to me when I 'm checking my email , and to ask for a stroke and breakfast ?
It 's a nice picture ... perhaps you will come back to this page again in a couple of minutes for another look ?
Well ... please keep the original copy and look at it again !
as there is little point in me giving you exactly the same information , or doing exactly the same work , time after time .
The web server can add cache and store headers onto pages ( and if you 're using PHP to serve images , this is a real " must " ) and you can also use facilities like memcached to save repeated expensive server calculation operations .
Here 's part of our PHP script which manages our image database - the part where it tells the browser to keep the information it 's been given for up to an hour , and not to keep asking for it .
This is very important for images like your logo which will appear on every page !
# Send out image
header ( " Content - type : image / jpeg " ) ;
header ( " Cache- control : max- age=3600 " ) ;
print $ imagebytes ;
You will also have seen me talking about adding restrictions into our robots .
txt file to avoid needless crawling of pages that really should n't be indexed , or where our scripts generate URL loops that can trip the spiders .
See here and here for some past experiences , and there 's a sample copy of our file here .
I have added a few ' loop killers ' since I wrote that example .
Have you ever seen a nice picture on someone else 's web site and added a link to it on yours ?
It 's called hot linking and if you link to an image on an obscure site from a very popular one , you can have a detrimental and sudden effect on that site .
There are occasions where our web site suddenly gets hundreds or thousands of hits from our of the blue - and really it 's theft of bandwidth and probably of images .
We are monitoring / watching such images - you can use my monitor tool here and see what 's a popular steal at the moment .
And you can read about past comments I have made and technical ways to discourage the habit here .
Finally , you can cut out some excess traffic by telling people that pages are broken .
You may recall past articles ( possibly no longer around even here ) showing how you can divert erroneous URL requests to your site search and return a good page .
Fabulously useful technique for real visitors , but it 's almost designed to set the search engines off in a feeding frenzy if they get a bad URL - especially if you suggest other searches .
Take care with scripts like this ... and ensure that your automata users are sent " 404 " responses , while being much more helpful to the customer who has just guessed at a UTR by serving him with useful guidance and content .
Where now
I do n't think I 've reached the end of the story yet .
Traffic will go on increasing and - at best - we 've currently got something of a lid on it ; occasional queues which will potentially get longer .
Yes , I know there 's a recession or depression on - but it's not depressed or recessed our traffic ( perhaps people have more free time and spend more time browsing , quite apart from the fact that this is a rather good site ! ) .
So keep reading The Horse 's Mouth and you 'll see the story continue to unfold .
If you have found this article useful , please remember that we can help you with issues like this in relation to your own servers .
We offer Linux / Unix Web Server courses and also a variety of PHP training and a MySQL course too .
But in addition / as a starter , please feel free to ask !
A day of help of advise may pay for itself a hundred times over - even if I can't come up with a complete solution , I can certainly give pointers and help look at your own , individual case .
The easiest way to contact me is via this form and I 'll be back to you within 24 hours .

Effect on server when memory runs out and swapping starts
Related topics : via article database
Here 's an interesting example from a web server showing what happens when real memory runs out and the system starts swapping ... it can be something of a downwards spiral in terms of performance , as the majority of the resources are essentially tied up by the swapping / keeping going at all once memory is full , and a hard to recover backlog of processes can build up .
First , an example where the system is running in memory :
And this is what can happen with a slightly higher arrival rate , and / or a slightly slower processing rate such that a queue builds up :
You 'll notice by comparing these two ( look at the purple highlights ) :
1 . The load average has rocketed from 0.23 jobs waiting ( average in last minute ) to 22.59 jobs .
2 . The cpu utilisation remains low - under 10 % - for user processes
3 . The cpu idle time has dropped from nearly 90 % to zero , with all the extra resource being burned up by device wait time - 93.6 % no less .
4 . Swap space has only increased slightly in its use , but every process in this machine is active and the whole thing hsa started thrashing which means a queue has built up ...
5 . There 's been a rise from 115 to 191 total tasks ( remember that the majority of the initial 115 will be operating system background processes , so that this is a truly massive increase )
6 . The process table itself is showing details of just how / where the queue has built up .
See here for some tuning information for httpd if it's the web server that 's consuming all the space ( there are MySQL notes there too ! )

Tuning httpd / the supermarket checkout comparison
Related topics : via article database
Why do you have multiple copies of " httpd " running on your web server , even though you have only got one process in startup ?
It 's because httpd spawns child processes which allow it to be handling several customers at the same time rather than have them stand in line and be processed sequentially .
It 's sensible / necessary because some of the clients may be a little bit slow ( waiting on resources such as disc or network transfer ) and rather than wait , the cpu should get on with other jobs .
There are various different models available within httpd ...
I 'm looking at the default prefork module here , and it 's very tune - able .
To understand how , I 'll compare it with a supermarket checkout .
A supermarket has a certain amount of space available with checkouts installed , but when they open they only open a few at first .
As they get busier , more are opened to keep ahead of the rush up to the maximum they have capacity for , and as business drops off , they will close some down - but they 'll never drop below a minimum waiting to serve .
After a certain number of customers , they may choose to service and then reopen a checkout .
Let 's see how the mpm_prefork module does that .
Firstly , in the httpd.conf file , you 'll enable the extra configuration file to allow you to move it away from all the defaults :
# Server-pool management ( MPM specific )
Include conf / extra/httpd-mpm.conf
The change was as simple as removing a # .
Then make changes to the file in the extra subdirectory to reflect the new configuration you want .
Let me translate the default into Supermarket terms :
< IfModule mpm_prefork_module >
StartServers 5
MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 10
MaxClients 150
MaxRequestsPerChild 0
</ IfModule >
" Our store has 150 checkouts .
Five of them are manned when the store is initially opened for business , and we always keep at least five in hand waiting to serve customers who walk up ( until all are open ) .
At times that our checkout staff are handling customers quicker than they 're arriving , we 'll close checkouts but we 'll keep at least ten open anyway in case more people walk up .
We do not set a limit for the number of customers an individual operator / checkout looks after in a single opening . "
There is further tuning of the checkout behaviour which can be changed too , via other defaults .
Once again , if you want to change these parameters you need to enable the settings via an extra file - here 's the modified line ( again , uncommenting is all I changed ) in the httpd.conf :
# Various default settings
Include conf / extra/httpd-default.conf
And here are the default settings that I 'm interested in :
Timeout 300
MaxKeepAliveRequests
100
KeepAliveTimeout 5
" If someone walks up to a checkout but then does n't actually give the clerk anything to checkout or just stops , give that person 300 seconds to actually get on with something before you chuck 'em and move on to the next customer .
When you finish selling something to someone , pause for up to 5 seconds to see if they have another item to purchase as well .
But only a hundred of the checkouts may be tied up in this wait state at any time " .
There are several different approaches to tuning these settings ... and also to tuning any back room services ( such as MySQL ) which the staff on the checkouts will be using :
• you could increase the number of checkouts available in order to reduce the amount of shutting down and starting up necessary , and to ensure that you have plenty of staff available at peak times or ...
• you could trim back and have a limited number of checkouts available that move quickly from one customer to the next , scarsely pausing for the slowcoaches .
The defaults are pretty middle - of - the - road , and the fact that you are reading this article is likely to mean you have issues - so have a look at the underlying cause before you do too much and be prepared to do a few tests !.
Monitoring tools include top , vmstat and uptime from Linux , the Apache Server Status page from httpd that you can enable , mysqladmin status from MySQL ... and you can use tools such as ab and jmeter to generate traffic flows too to test your system .
To conclude - three sample ( amended ) configuration files ...
Keeping a lot more checkouts open ( but be careful that you do n't end up paying so much overtime ( i.e. using swap space ) that you loose more that you gain :
< IfModule mpm_prefork_module >
StartServers 10
MinSpareServers 10
MaxSpareServers 25
MaxClients 250
MaxRequestsPerChild 10000
</ IfModule >
For a system which has limited memory ( " you do n't really want the expense and time consuming trouble of serving people in a portacabin , so make the very best use of your limited floor space ! " ) :
< IfModule mpm_prefork_module >
StartServers 4
MinSpareServers 4
MaxSpareServers
8
MaxClients 35
MaxRequestsPerChild 10000
</ IfModule >
And here are some tunings for the default file :
Timeout 60
MaxKeepAliveRequests 20
KeepAliveTimeout 3
Here 's the rationale behind that one : " It 's a fast moving site , and ( let 's face it ! ) people will get bored after waiting for a minute - so may as well time out them .
Keep the number of checkouts waiting for a further purchase down ; avoid the danger of the whole store being clogged up with checkouts waiting for Mrs Jones to run back for some sugar , or for Johnny Smith to dash over and get an extra Mars bar because he had n't noticed the 2 for 1 offer .
And keep the time that Mrs J and Johnny are allowed for such antisocial actions down . "

What a difference a MySQL Index made
Related topics : via article database
If you add an index to a column in a MySQL table , you provide a very quick way of looking up a row or set of rows based on the value in a certain column , but at the expense of additional disc space and a bit more internal management .
Here 's an example in which I look up a record ( by URL ) in a table of around 15000 records , some of which are quite large .
mysql > select url , halflife from cn_content where url = ' /net/recents.html ' ;
+-------------------+----------+
| url | halflife |
+-------------------+----------+
| /net/recents.html | 2 |
+-------------------+----------+
1 row in set ( 0.30 sec )
That 's running at around 3 requests per second , which as a part of our web site logging is a significant load .
Let 's create an index , stating that the URL will be unique in the first 100 characters :
mysql > create unique index pagename on cn_content ( url ( 100 ) ) ;
Query OK , 15176 rows affected ( 1.80 sec )
Records : 15176 Duplicates : 0 Warnings : 0
mysql
This did not work for me first time ; the were a couple of lines where the pagename was not unique in my table , and I had the " opportunity " to resolve the issues .
Once sorted , my enquiry gave the same results ( so it was plug - and - play compatible ) but much faster :
mysql > select url , halflife from cn_content where url = ' /net/recents.html ' ;
+-------------------+----------+
| url | halflife |
+-------------------+----------+
| /net/recents.html | 2 |
+-------------------+----------+
1 row in set ( 0.02 sec )
That 's up from 3 requests per second to 50 - and a huge improvement !

How was my web site compromised ?
Related topics : via article database Useful link : MySQL training
It looks to me as if this car has left the road and come to a sudden halt against the building , with the result that both have been somewhat damaged .
But why did it happen ?
Was there a mechanical failure such as brakes or tyres ?
Did the driver fall asleep at the wheel or something distract him ?
Was he drunk ?
Or did he swerve to avoid a child on a cycle ?
Perhaps there 's a more unlikely reason - perhaps there was no driver in the car , but it was left stopped on a slope and ran away , or it fell off the back of a lorry .
When presented with a web site that 's been compromised - with new files created , databases and their records changed , or data injected into existing files , it can be rather hard to work out what has happened - rather like trying to find what caused a motor accident .
And one photograph is going to give clues , but no more - the picture above is from a page of public domain images , and I know no more than that .
So " educated guess " is my best hope .
If I 'm going to be looking at a system that 's been compromised , I 'm going to look not only at the content of the file (s ) and database (s ) that are infected , but also for certain other tell - tale files that might have been added to the system - especially at around the same time .
And I 'm also going to take a very careful look at who is allowed to do what to which resources .
In other words , file permissions , and user and group ownerships .
Here 's an answer , just written , concerning infected files ...
If you have infected files , have a look at the write permissions on the infected files .... who can write to them ?
If they 're writeable by the web server user , then is that just yourself , or is this a shared hosting machine ?
If the scripts are PHP and it's a shared server , then the start of the hole may not be in your area , but the write permissions being wrong in your area have let the sh*t land on you .
What causes such scripts to allow files to be written ?
Typically scripts written with the best intent , but in which the file name can be taken from the user / seeded by a form .
John can create a file called " John.html " , perhaps .
And Harry a file called Harry.html ... all perfectly good names in a directory called " users " .
Then along comes someone called ../index.html ... and he overrides the home page at the top of the site .
Be aware , too , off the cross - site scripting possibilities of Mr " http://www.sheepbingo.co.uk/ " who might find one of your scripts that he can pull his code into and have it run on your system .
And these concerns apply not only to the scripts you have written yourself , but also those which you have sourced from elsewhere .
With Perl , the script may be run as the user ( via setuid ) or as the web server , and you should take a look at which of the two your setup uses in order to help you with the analysis .

A Presentation about our company - web and PHP
Related topics : via article database
In answer to a request for further information about our training centre , the town in which it 's located , and our training methods and facilities , I 've put together a " Slide show " style page .
The images on the left , a few of which may look familiar from our image map demo of the other week , all make up a show which the user can step through gently and automatically , can step through by clicking forward at his own pace , or can " Cherry pick " from .
Just click on an image - or here - to start the demo
Always being one to re-use useful programs ... I have also published the source code in case you want to do the same sort of thing .
You 'll still need to find and crop all the good images ( actually I had too many ! ) and write the text , but you can be saved the programming .

Why the Pony Tail ?
Related topics : via article database Useful link : PHP training
I 'm not sure if " why do you have a ponytail " is a question about a course or about a subject we teach ... actually it 's rather personal ... but it 's a good question and I have chosen to answer in this case .
Here are three possible answers for the beard - and - ponytail question .
Which do you think it is ?
a ) I like it .
I feel comfortable with it , and I have chosen it for that reason .
b) It 's easily maintained .
No need to be rushing to the barber 's shop every few weeks , nor to be shaving on a daily basis ... and there 's something exhilarating about trimming one 's beard that you do n't get from shaving .
c ) It 's a career choice .
I used to train under contract for another company , and jobs were allocated by the " buggin 's turn " ( the selection of a trainer by rotation ) principle unless one particular trainer was asked for .
Now I got good reviews , and I wanted repeat bookings ( = a more consistent income flow ! ) , so I took on a distinctive look so that people could ask for me by name ... or by distinctive looks .
The answer is that all three reasons apply .
If I did n't like it , if it was n't easily ( ish ! ) maintained or was unpleasant to maintain , I would n't have it .
However it still , years later , provides that slightly different look that helps me to stand out in a crowd and , with my various roles , that 's no bad thing at times .
Take last night , but that 's another story ...

Why Choose Well House Consultants for your course ?
Related topics : via article database
The course must cover the right subject .
From the right starting point .
And at the right pace .
It must be taught be someone who knows the subject , can present it in such a way that you can take in what you 're being taught , and who can ( and will ) advise you on what is the best way for you to apply what you learn .
The tutor must keep your interest and attention during the training .
Price , location and dates will also be important .
But there are other aspect you 'll take into consideration too - from how sure you can be ( or not ! ) that the course will actually run if you 've booked it , through the size of the group to be taught and the facilities at the training centre , to whether you 'll be able to get back to the training company and ask questions after the course is over .
At Well House Consultants , we provide all the basics ... to a high quality ... and much more too .
What do we provide ?
What differentiates our courses ?
Here are some of the features that our pages highlight ... and I 'll fill you in with more detail below .
For details of dates and individual courses , go here or click on the individual subject links .
Features of all our courses
• A purpose fitted training centre
• Book , and our course will run - guarantee
• Small groups ( max 8 delegates )
• Courses presented by the author
• Overnight accommodation for delegates
• After course email support included
Our courses are different ...
• A warm welcome the night before
• Complimentary railway station pick up
• No minimum numbers ; courses always run
• Run at our own training centre
• Stay with us - we are also a hotel
• Courses presented by the author
• Maximum of just 8 delegates per course
• Post - course support included
• The right subject
We teach programming in Perl , PHP , Python , Lua , Java , Ruby , Tcl , C and C ++.
We also teach Linux , MySQL and Apache httpd and Tomcat web server deployment .
We may add other niche subjects from time to time ( please ask ) , but we have our work cut out with all this lot and we do not offer courses in Microsoft Word , Excel , Vista , C# , .NET , food hygiene or management .
• The right starting point
Some of our delegates have programmed before , and others are new to programming .
So we offer both " conversion " courses for those who are already familiar with computer programming , and slightly longer " learn to program " courses for those who need to start from first principles .
We also offer a limited number of advanced courses on our public schedule , such as the PHP techniques Workshop and Perl for Larger Projects - however , advanced delegate 's needs tend to be very varied , and more often that not we 'll complete a trainee 's program by adding on one or two private days .
• The right pace
We try to strike a balance .
You 'll want time to absorb and practise what you 're being taught , but at the same time you wo n't want us to stretch the subject into more days that are necessary , costing you and your employer more days and expense .
We 're well positioned to strike the balance ... ( 1 ) - as we have different courses for newcomers to programming and those converting , we can more carefully group or trainees ... ( 2 ) - our group sizes are small , so the tutor has more time to spend with each individual , and the group does not get held back by a slow ' rump ' ... ( 3 ) - you stay with us at our hotel , so you can get extra practise in the evening and early morning too if you wish .
• Tutor to know the subject
We make use ourselves of the subjects we teach .
We write our own notes .
It 's the author who presents the course , every time .
We travel the world ourselves to learn from the people who write the languages themselves - across Europe , to Asia , to North America .
And we take care , when questions arise from delegates to which we do n't have an immediate answer to research the question , to GET an answer - for the delegate who asked , and for other delegates who follow on too .
• Tutor 's presentation skills
Only a few " techies " make good tutors .
And the most technical of people does n't necessarily make for the clearest of presentations .
You 'll find that we have an enthusiasm to teach the subject ( and that is infectious ! ) and years of professional experience that mean that we will filter out and present the material that you need , in a way that you can easily assimilate .
• Keeping up the interest
Even the most fascinating of subjects can become a yawn if you do n't have some variation in the presentation - and that 's generally accepted as no more than an hour of the same type of activity without a break .
You 'll find that our courses mix and match a number of styles .
You 'll have whiteboard presentation , interactive demonstrations , question and answer sessions , case studies and practicals , and team work too ... as well as the more conventional projected presentations and lectures .
And we ask you to bring your data and your needs along to the table so that we can include there and make the course even more relevant and interesting .
• Tutor 's advice for YOU
You 're encouraged to bring along your data , to discuss your applications and options - not only with the tutor but with the rest of the class too .
Decisions such as whether to store images in a database or plain files , whether to use Perl or Python , and what naming convention to use for variables too need to be made , and will effect you for years to come .
I wo n't say " we 've seen it all before " , but we have seen a lot of it and give you pointers that will help you to be well informed for decisions you need to make .
• Can I practise ?
Yes .
We have a laptop available for every delegate to use for the duration of the course ( multiple laptops on courses that involve clustering / load balancing / network programming ) .
That laptop is online so that you can browse whatever resources you need , and available to you throughout your time on site ( as we 're also a hotel and you may be staying , that means 24 hours a day ! ) .
The tutor is almost always available for an hour before the course starts each morning to assist with extra questions that arise , and often stays late .
And a member of the technical team is usually on site until 10 p.m. , with ' customer service ' being his top priority .
And then there 's the library of some 700 technical books available to you .
• Price
We keep it simple - 350 pounds for the first day of a course , and 250 pounds for each subsequent day .
A 100 pound discount off your second and subsequent delegates on the same course , but no inflated ' list price ' to allow us to offer huge discounts to almost everyone .
You 'll find our bottom line will be slightly below the industry norm , but the product that you get will be streets ahead .
• Location
Our public courses run in Melksham , Wiltshire , England .
And , yes , we know that means that 80 % of delegates have to stay over .
But our subjects are niche and that need to stay over would apply anywhere else ( we have investigated ! ) .
So we make sure that we are in an accessible location - you can get to us by your own , or public , transport - and once you 're with us we have everything under one roof ; a quiet training centre and hotel with nothing to disturb your concentration and learning .
If you have a group of delegates , we can come to you - see here .
• How do I get to the course ?
We have plenty of parking ( for 2 and 4 wheels ! ) .
We have a bus stop right outside .
We have local railway stations , from which we can arrange a complimentary lift , and we can arrange for airport travel for you too .
Arrive the evening before the course , settle in , get to know your surroundings , get a good night 's sleep and you 'll be ready to make the very best of your course .
[ [ Melksham is about 100 miles to the west of London - allow about 100 minutes by train , 2 hours if driving .
The Fosse Way takes you directly north to the Midlands , and from there you can take the motorway network to the North East or North West . ] ]
• Can I stay commute ?
You are very welcome to travel to the course every day , though we 'll advise you to stay with us if your journey would be over an hour each way .
If you do n't stay , you 'll miss out on all the extra opportunities after we 've completed formal training for the day , and you may find that your learning is blunted by the tiredness caused by unaccustomed driving - but you 'll be best to judge this individually for yourself .
• Can I stay locally ?
Yes - even if you 're not commuting , we do n't require you to stay with us - but do have a look at our Well House Manor before you decide .
We 've had delegates who have stayed with friends , with relatives , and with archaeological contacts , and we have even had a delegate on honeymoon .
That 's not something that I would recommend for everyone , as staying away from the centre and planning other activities can lead to a conflict of interests .
• Dates
Each of our courses is scheduled to run every 3 to 4 months ( a few such as PHP Programming and Learning to program in Python a little more often . )
Usually , our courses for those with prior programming experience run during the week ( Monday through Friday ) , with the extra days added onto the beginning - the weekend - for those who want a " Leaning to Program in ... " course .
That 's because most of the newcomers to programming who come to us are keen to learn , and keen not to have to take too many days away from the office , and they appreciate the compromise .
See here for a full diary for this year .
• Will the course run ?
Yes .
Once you have booked on your course , we guarantee that we 'll run it - even if you are the only delegate .
We are ( frankly ) ashamed of our industry 's bad habit of accepting bookings then cancelling them is a certain threshold is n't reached .
And we have been on the ' other side ' too , having courses that we have been booked to attend cancelled at the last minutes , after flights and hotels were booked .
• Will the course be up to date ?
I am going to be very careful how I answer this one .
The course will reflect the current practise and versions of software in common use , will mention older versions which are still in common use , and will look forward to new and future releases which may not yet be common and / or stable and / or released .
In other words , the course will be up to date with current practical usage , which means that we do NOT throw out an established software release as soon as a new version comes out .
But if there are significant changes , we will have a copy of the new release .
• Course size
We limit our public courses to eight delegates .
I have taught a higher number on a single public course in the past , and found that I have been unable to give each delegate the individual customer service that he / she may need - assistance and advise during practical sessions , answers to questions that arise during lectures , etc .
Our training facilities can seat up to 20 , and indeed we have equipment for up to 16 people on a private course , where all the delegates will have a similar background and questions and the larger class size is practical .
• The Training Room
Our training room is purpose - fitted to give you the very best course .
Each delegate gets a generous workspace area , with a clear view of the whiteboards that cover three walls .
A modern projection system which allows interactive demonstrations is complimented by a lighting system set up to ensure that every delegate gets the very best of experiences .
Seating is modern and comfortable , and of course wired and wireless internet access is available at all desks .
• The Delegate 's Workspace
Each delegate has at least a metre of desk space , a full set of training notes provided to accompany the course , use of a laptop ( choice of Linux , Windows , OS X ) for the duration on the course .
We provide pens , paper , etc ... and delegates are welcome to bring teas , coffees , water and soft drinks into the training room .
• Training Centre Facilities
We 're a hotel ... and you 'll find almost everything you would expect at a 4 star hotel , and a lot more beside .
All rooms are large and en-suite .
Beds are King size in all rooms ( we let doubles as singles routinely ) .
All rooms have laptop safes , mini fridges , large flat screen TVs with over 50 channels available .
We 're not licensed , but you will find a bottle opener in your room , and you 'll find knives , forks and a microwave available too .
Access is available to the training room all day and all night for delegates .
You may also take the laptop you 're using up to your room , which has its own desk and internet ( wired and wireless ) access , and there 's a library of 700 technical volumes , and a network printer , available too .
For relaxation , we 've got a selection of other books and DVDs available for you use , and even some old fashioned games if you want to play with your fellow delegates .
You are welcome help yourself to freshly ground coffee and tea at any time , and to wander in our 3/ 4 acres of garden ...
• Asking questions later
And finally ... what if you have a question ?
You are welcome to ask during the course and if I can't answer right away ( or if it would pull us off topic ) I 'll make a note and come back to it .
And if you have a question after the course , you 're very welcome to email it to me and I 'll get back to you with at least some technical comment within 2 days ( actually , my target is 1 day but I promise just two ) .
Please do n't be shy about asking such questions - they 're our lifeblood and they help us know what we should be adding to our courses ... or to this web site ... to help other delegates .
If you want to ask me a question now you are welcome to do so .
I look forward to hearing from you , and - perhaps - to welcoming you on a course .

Learning to program in PHP , Python , Java or Lua ...
Related topics : via article database
... or in Ruby , Tcl , C , C++ or Perl
Are you new to computer programming ?
Is it so long since you programmed that you feel very rusty and would like to start again from basics ?
If you 've said " yes " to either of these questions our new " Learning to program in .... " series of courses may be exactly what you need !
The majority - but NOT all - of our programming course delegates already have some prior knowledge in another language , and the courses they attend can start quite fast as they cover common ground , before getting into unique specifics .
However a sizeable and increasing minority have not programmed before , and so we 're adding an optional extra day onto the start of most of our courses so that we can provide these customers with an appropriate product too .
I have already taught a number of " Learning to program " courses ... and in each case I start from first principles , showing delegates how programs are written from scratch , and how to work our what to do ( the analysis ) as well as how to do it ( the programming ) .
It 's not done just off a set of notes - real programs are written for the newcomers in front of their very eyes , and they get a chance to do it and to get a couple of their own short examples under their belt before the main course .
Here are the " learning to program " courses ... listed alongside the shorter coursed for experienced programmers
Many of the delegates who have been asking me for " learning to " courses are retraining to take on a new role , or to take over someone else 's tasks in the current economic climate , and they do n't have very many weekdays to spare for the course .
So I have scheduled many of the extra days on the weekend , immediately before the ' main ' subject course starts on the Monday .
And these learners may not have a limitless budget either , so for bookings confirmed before the end of April [ 2009 ] on courses taken before the end of July , we 'll give you the extra ' learning to " day at no tuition charge - you 'll just be paying the extra £ 60.00 + VAT for your hotel room with us for an extra night .
And as it's likely to be one - on - one tuition prior to a main course with a handful of delegates , that 's a bargain you can't afford to miss !
Click on the individual course names in the table above for details ... call in ( 01225 708225 ) to book at these special rates .
I look forward to teaching you to program ...
I 've been programming for many years and it is still f u n !

Small Web Server in Perl
Related topics : via article database Useful links : Python training
I would not encourage you to write your own web server in Perl , but I might suggest that you used the http protocol as a convenient intersystem communication protocol ... and that might result in you implementing part of http for the purpose ;-)
With that proviso in mind , I have just added source code for a miniature server to our web site ... run it on a system and that system will act as a web server , within limits ... and it will give you a springboard from which you can make use of the http protocol and the data uploaded through it .
Running example ( visited from a browser on another system ) :
earth - wind - and - fire : ~/ Desktop grahamellis$ ./miniserver.pl 4434
/ Users/grahamellis/public_html/tictim.html
_status = 200
jjj = iii jkjhhgj
_method = GET
/ Users/grahamellis/public_html/favicon.ico
_status = 404
_method = GET
^C
earth - wind - and - fire : ~/ Desktop grahamellis$
If you 're wanting to write code like this , have a look at our Using Perl on The Web course .
And if you want to learn how to set up a more regular web server , consider our Apache httpd deployment course instead .

Does robots .
txt actually work ?
Related topics : via article database
If you put an entry into your robots .
txt file to ask the various robots to disallow ( cease crawling ) certain files and directories , do they actually take note of your request ... considering that it's a purely voluntary standard ...
Three or four days back , I excluded some old map pages which were being heavily crawled and I 've just visited my log files for the last fortnight :
- bash - 3.2 $ egrep -c ' net/+map ' ac_200902 *

Please Trouble me
Related topics : via article database
" I do n't like to trouble you " ... so say the British , and the British delegates who come on our courses .
It 's something of a nationalistic trait ( goodness - I hope it is n't that I 'm an Ogre , though I understand they have hearts too ) .
But I want people to trouble me ! .
Why ?
Because I want to know what questions people are asking .
Because that tells me what I should Blog about , and what I should add to our courses .
And Because they questions help me learn and I am always learning !
I 've just added a new page to our web site , and images like the one that 's on the left of this article will appear soon on our course descriptions and other pages , soliciting questions about the courses ... and technical questions too .
We 're a customer service company - and we enjoy , and thrive , on providing what you 're looking for - answers , courses , and hotel rooms .
If you 're a regular reader of this blog - or if this is your first time - why not say " Hi " ? - just click on the image , and I look forward to hearing from you .

Confidence , Customer Service and Tourism in Melksham
Related topics : via article database
I was very disappointed to miss the " business opportunities / where do we go from here " meeting in Melksham last week - organised by the Town Council and with support from many including the Chamber of Commerce .
But Lisa ( who is on The Chamber Committee ) did go along , listened , let me know what happened ... and also copied my on her contribution , reproduced here with her permission as it says something of the opportunities and spirit of Melksham !
" " " In a former life , I lived in Florida for 20 years .
We paid no state sales tax , and our tax on purchases was only 4 % .
Then what supported the infrastructure and emergency services ?
It was tourism .
It was the orange industry .
Tourism .
It was the beef industry .
Oh , and it was tourism .
As a resident who had to put up with constant sunshine , the smell of coconut oil , families laughing and frolicking in the sand , I had to be reminded of everyone else 's holiday while I was looking out my window at work ...
I also had to endure traffic jams and not being able to get in to restaurants because of the queues .
But this only lasted from November to April .
The rest of the time we had it to ourselves , and even though we complained about the invasion of snowbirds each winter , you can bet we polished our smiles every year in anticipation of the next tourist season .
Because it brought jobs , low taxes , and a better lifestyle ... 12 months a year .
People soon discover after hearing me speak about 5 words that I am originally not from this country , a common segue into conversation is to talk about their own American experience , and many times it's to tell me how friendly they thought Americans are .
I 'm not going to deny a friendliness , but I want to take you back to Florida and tell you that people in the service industry ( which is what tourism is ) know the value of customer service .
It costs nothing , but it reaps huge rewards .
When I moved to Melksham almost 10 years ago , I was struck with how friendly a town it was .
But as I shared this feeling I had with others , I discovered I was n't alone in these thoughts .
Melksham was not only a friendly place , it was notable as being a friendly place .
My husband and I like to take pictures , and sometimes when we 're at home at the weekend , we might pop out and take a few pictures of places we'd not been before , but ca n't stray too far because of time .
We keep remarking about how many places there are that we 've never been , all local to Melksham .
Look at a map .
We might not be THE tourist spot , but we 're central to so many tourist places that Melksham should be a tourist home base .
But Melksham is n't solely in a good place for people to come at weekends either .
When we moved to Melksham , we also brought our computer training business .
It 's so specialist that we did n't choose Melksham for the customers , but rather for the location .
It 's also central to a number of our customers , coming from all different parts of the UK , some even farther .
If we opened in London , we would have disappeared , in competition with all the other training companies .
And often we hear our customers say they chose us because we were n't in London , or were closer to them .
And some London companies send their employees to us , to stay in the area for up to a week , so they can get away from office distractions .
Because they do stay overnight , we moved our training into a larger building and started offering accommodation .
First to our students , and then to other local businesses because of demand for it , and then we discovered a tourism trade at the weekends too .
I look at the companies on Bowerhill .
My husband and I are not alone in thinking that Melksham is a good place for a business .
Knorr Bremse , Easyspace and Great Bear Distribution are only a handful of the more recent additions that have confidence Melksham is the right location for them too .
And having supplied hotel rooms to many of our students and to the businesses in Melksham and nearby , and to those touring the area , and those coming for weddings and visiting family at weekends , we know that Melksham also brings in people .
And these people need a place to eat evening meals .
They get their hair done .
They buy flowers .
Need dry cleaning .
They stop for a pint .
We had a student last week go to the Refa for an evening meal and he got to talking with either Rob or Gias .
He asked where a good place locally was to buy some sporting equipment .
The next day the student remarked to my husband " Gosh , Melksham has everything you need ! "
Sometimes we get complacent and take for granted what 's in our community .
And sometimes it takes some fresh eyes to get you to reopen your own eyes .
Yes , Melksham does have everything we need .
We 're in a great location .
And we 're the friendliest community I 've ever run across .
And the funny thing is that we have people quietly coming to Melksham , who have never been here before .
They live among us for a few days to a week .
Imagine if they went back home and talked about coming back with their partners and family to tour the area , and to stay in Melksham because it 's so well located and because the people are so friendly .
And because Melksham has great customer service .
From what I have seen , Melksham has it naturally .
If we as a community can get together and learn how to fine tune that , we 'll not only get the business , but we 'll keep it .
Especially in the harder times .
And it does n't cost a thing . " " "

Wiltshire Rail Service Update
Related topics : via article database
Those of you who have seen my involvement in looking for an improved rail service across Wiltshire may feel I 've been very low - key about it of late .
Maybe - but there * have * been some things going on in the background .
And you can expect to see more coming up in the future .
Here 's a starter - a page that I produced yesterday morning , updating people and looking for a three - hourly service as from next December .
That should be just a starter ... we 're looking at such rapid growth planned in this part of Wiltshire that an improvement will be needed within a couple of years , and we 're looking at a new government paper that promised to write improvements made in the 2011 - 2014 timeframe into the next generation of franchises - here 's to a truely approropriate TransWilts service for the next decade !
TransWilts Railway - Backbone of Wiltshire ?
It could be , once again , in Twenty Ten !
In 2000 , Wessex Trains , Wiltshire County Council and the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising reached an agreement that provided a TransWilts train service of five trains each way , each day .
As a result , use grew rapidly .
In 2005 , The First Group , the Strategic Rail Authority and Wiltshire County Council failed to agree on how to continue a reasonable service , and it was slashed back to just two round trips , starting at quarter past six in the morning , and quarter to seven at night .
For 2010 , there is an opportunity for the Department for Transport , the new Wiltshire Unitary Authority , and First Great Western ( or South West Trains ) to put their heads together and provide an appropriate service to connect the five major urban centres in Wiltshire ... Swindon , Chippenham , Melksham , Trowbridge and Salisbury - and Westbury , Dilton Marsh and Warminster too .
These are Trains that will halve some of the public transport journey times between these towns , will cut some car journeys , will relieve some parking and congestion , and will encourage visitors to the area .
A new county ... a new authority ... a new train operator .
They have it in their power to provide a reliable , robust , rapid , really useful public transport link .
Since the service was cut in 2006 , derelict factories have been replace by houses at Melksham Station .
What a pity there 's scarcely a train service !
The " Save the Train " campaign , other groups and the authorities concerned , agree that an appropriate service is a train at least once every two hours .
Rapid growth of the the towns along the route ( 50 % population increase planned by 2026 ) may require still more frequent and longer trains .
However , an interim service improvement of six carefully timed trains per day running from December 2009 will restore the rapid growth that was lost in 2006 , then continue to grow at 10 % to 35 % per annum ( current econmonic climate considered , too ! )
Current Timetable at Melksham
Weekdays : north at 07:17 & 19:47 , south at 06:40 & 19:11
Saturday : north at 09:18 & 15:19 , south at 15:45 & 21:34
Sunday : north at 17:21 & 19:52 , south at 18:57 ( only )
TransWilts - the current proposals
The following service was evaluated for the current timetable ( to run from December 2008 ) :
• Swindon - Salisbury @ 06:18 - 09:02 - 12:02 - 15:02 - 17:55 - 18:45
• Salisbury - Swindon @ 06:12 - 07:40 - 10:31 - 13:31 - 16:24 - 18:41
• Serving Chippenham , Melksham , Trowbridge , Westbury , Dilton Marsh and Warminster
• A train WAS available • Train crews were available •
There was a path available
Why did n't it happen ?
County Council will tell you they could n't find 1 p per Wiltshire household per week to help the service for the first years .
Yet they spend millions on subsidising buses , many of which carry just one or two passengers .
First will tell you it 's more profitable to run the earmarked train shadowing a competitor on another line .
The Department for Transport will tell you that they will match County funding .
Trowbridge to Swindon - 35 minutes by train or 95 minutes by bus .
Which do YOU prefer ?
The Save the Train Campaign asks First Great Western , the Department for Transport , and the new Wiltshire Unitary Authority to agree to provide an appropriate service from December 2009 .
For the good of the people of Wiltshire .
For the prosperity and success of the county .
And for their own good too .
The well thought out and resourced service proposed for this year would be a practical , excellent start !
Please watch out for - and support - our campaign this year .
We are asking for something that is attainable and affordable .
The infrastructure is already there .
The subsidy requested for a few years is less that the cost of one average house in Wiltshire !
Chippenham to Salisbury - an hour by direct TransWilts train or two hours with a change by bus .

httpd , Tomcat and PHP course enhancements
Related topics : via article database
If you 're in an area of the UK that 's covered by 3G phone service , we can now have our training computers on line during private courses on your site without having to add our machines inside your firewall .
You just provide ' the room and the students ' and we do the rest .
We have always provided an " easy to set up " private training course service where you have nothing to provide but the trainees and a conference room , running our network independently , but this extra facility now allows us to use online resources during the courses .
It will be a real * plus * for advanced , tailored courses on subjects such as Web Server Deployment ( both Tomcat and Apache httpd ) ... and also for use during practical sessions on PHP courses , allowing delegates to reference the online facilities of www.php.net directly just as they doubtless will after their course .
I 'm really excited by this new development - it makes for even more effective training , with answers to * your * unusual questions raised during the course just a couple of clicks away , with the expertise of the tutor used in real time to filter out solutions from vast online resources .
A practical test of the new facility this week in Milton Keynes went off better that we would have dared to predict .
Extra cost to you - NOTHING - it's that extra service that we 're providing as part of the package to make our courses even more effective and attractive - we believe in Customer service !
We cannot guarantee coverage at your office , but you can check what the phone company says here .
We CAN assure you of connectivity throughout the course if you come to our training centre ... a private course here in Melksham with us gets your team off site and concentrating on learning , complete with hotel accommodation and team building evenings .
A great way to look after your staff !

Error : Cant read xxxxx : no such variable ( in Tcl Tk )
Related topics : via article database Useful link : PHP training
If you set a Tcl ( Tcl / Tk ) variable within a proc , or within the callback command of a widget , that variable does not exist at run time until you have run the proc or callback procedure , or until you have initialised the variable in some other way .
Let 's see a Tk example .
I have created a window with two buttons .
The one labelled " Press me first " creates a variable called pressed than contains the value hello .
And the one labelled " Press me second " updates the label called .report with the value that 's stored in the variable .
If you run the program , pressing the first button first , and the second button second , it works as illustrated at the top of this entry to the left and right .
But if you press the button labelled press me second without pressing the button labelled press me first , you get this :
Here is the complete code that I used to generate these examples :
button .demo1 - text " Press me first " - command {
global pressed
set pressed hello
}
button .demo2 - text " Press me second " - command {
global pressed
. report configure - text $ pressed
}
button .quit - text exit - command exit
label .report - text " ---"
pack .demo1 .demo2 .report .quit
What should you do if you are getting a message such as " Error : Can't read ' pressed ' : no such variable " ?
• check your logic
• if necessary , initialise the variable outside your callbacks
• check that you have used global if necessary ( in order to share a variable from within a proc with the same variable of the same name in the main code )
• send me an email to say you found this article useful !
We run regular public Tcl and expect courses and Tcl / Tk and wish courses .
For a full schedule of all of our public courses , see here
This short article was written in response to an emailed question .
I answered :
It looks like you are trying to use the contents of a variable before you set it - remember that variables in Tcl are only created when you actually run the code that sets them , so a definition within a proc will only cause the variable to be created when the proc is actually run .
Your question is a very good one , and you have provided inspiration for a full example on my blog - see :

The Invoker
Related topics : via article database Useful link :
Tcl training
Who , what or where is the Invoker ?
There are web sites that have a lot of pages on them , none of which is served up all that often , and there are other web sites which only host a few web applications , each of which is run in a container service such as Catalina within Tomcat .
In the first case , the web site developer / maintainer wants to simply add extra pages to the appropriate directory and have them appear at their own URLs , but in the latter case ( s ) he will usually want to specifically point individual URLs at individual applications .
And on Tomcat , this is done though the web.xml file .
But just occasionally under Tomcat , there 's a requirement to be able to copy a Class that contains a servlet on the web server , and have it available straight away - no mucking about with web.xml .
For example , I 'm training systems administrators who will be looking after a system used by Java classes ( University ones , not ours ! ) this week , and their students need to be able to upload a class that contains a servlet , and with minimal fuss and editing , test it on the server .
This is where the Invoker comes in .
To enable the invoker ... in the administrator 's main web application configuration file ( also called web.xml , but in the conf directory ) , remove the comments that disable the Invoker in the sample file supplied with the Tomcat distribution .
That extra code comes in two sections - one to define what the invoker IS and and other to define how it MAPS - and you need them both .
Then kick [ restart ] your Tomcat .
To use the invoker for a new Servlet ... place the class file in the WEB - INF / classes subdirectory of your web application , and visit it via a URL of the form :
http://www.sitename.org.uk/webappname/servlet/Whichone
where webappname is the name of your web application ( directory name in the webapps folder ) and Whichone is the class name - i.e. the file is called Whichone.class .
The word " servlet " is ' hard coded ' in the web.xml file - you can change it server - wide if you wish !
We go through all of this ( and much , much more ! ) on our Deploying Apache httpd / Tomcat course .

Sticky Sessions with mod_jk ( httpd to Tomcat )
Related topics : via article database
If you 're load balancing with mod_jk , you can put a load balancer worker in your jk properties file , and then have requests forwarded to all the workers that are members of that load balancer .
That 's a great way to share the load .
But if you 're running applications that rely on a series of linked pages ( sessions ) the you really do n't want your client 's requests to be forwarded at random - you want to pass them back to the same worker they were talking to last time .
In real life , this is like saying that if you go into a shop , you can pay at any till , but if you make a series of telephone calls to sort out a complicated utility bill you really want to get through to the same clerk to serve you each time .
You can set up this " sent back to the same person " scenario if your application is written using Java 's session classes ; in the workers configuration file add a line to specify the domain for each host , and a line to set sticky sessions on in the balance worker :
worker.list=catkin
worker.oak.port=8189
worker.oak.host=192.168.200.215
worker.oak.lbfactor=5
worker.oak.domain=easterton
worker.elm.port=8189
worker.elm.host=192.168.200.219
worker.elm.lbfactor=10
worker.elm.domain=holt
worker.catkin.type=lb
worker.catkin.balanced_workers=oak,elm
worker.catkin.sticky_session=1
In your Tomcat configuration file on EVERY server , set the jvmRoute of the engine to be the same as the domain name stated in the worker entry - for example :
< Engine name = " Catalina " defaultHost =" localhost " jvmRoute = " oak " >
Remember that is you stop and start your various servers during testing , that will NOT have reset / cleared the cookies held at the browsers you are testing from and you may see some odd effects - what you are doing is like changing a program , but saving the variables .
It 's a good idea to stop everything , clear out all relevant cookies and caches , and restart as a final test before releasing the system to users .
If you are using mod_jk and have turned sticky sessions on , but your sessions are failing to stick , you have probably failed to set the domain , or you have failed to set the jvmRoute , or you are using a non-standard cookie name to implement the stickyness !
With Apache 2.2 , mod_proxy_balancer has replaced many uses of mod_jk ; similar setup principles apply - there are more mod_proxy resources here and here .
We cover the connection of Apache httpd to Apache Tomcat on our public Deploying Apache httpd and Tomcat course , and we also cover them as appropriate on private courses ; the examples above come from this afternoon 's examples on a private course .
Footnote - although the build documentation for mod_jk talks about Apache 1.3 and Apache 2.0 , the ( 2.0 ) scheme works perfectly well for you to build for 2.2 .
However , once you have built a mod_jk library , that built file will ONLY work reliably with the version / subversion you built it for .
It 's no good getting someone else 's 2.0.43 and expecting it to work on 2.0.44 !

The Interview and The Lift
Related topics : via article database
The Interview was for a pressure position - European Software Support Specialist for an American product - working for the American manufacturer and based at their single European office in Basingstoke , from where they co-ordinate their distribution and dealership network through Europe .
It went well enough ; my technical background was n't completely unknown to the team already working there , and they had a product range in which I could have faith , and thus enthusiasm .
But could I stand the pressure ?
Leaving the interview on the top floor , the MD shook my hand and I stepped into the lift .
The doors closed .
And the lift moved about 3 inches down , and juddered to a halt .
Buttons pressed , and nothing ; something had failed .
That big button with the red bell that 's in most lifts - the one that should be labelled - " OY - I AM STUCK IN HERE " pressed , and bells rang around .
Picture , if you can , the doors prised open by a few inches , and my interviewer offering to feed me sandwiches through the crack .
A very strange way to conclude an interview ( and I was assured wholly unintentional ) , but I think it must have answered that pressure question as I was offered - and accepted - the job , rising quite quickly to becoming the European Technical Support Manager with an " if it 's Monday it must be Brussels " type job .
And a lot of other good stories .
I 'll have to tell , some time , of pulling circuit boards out of a system to reseat the chips at 3 a.m. on an exhibition stand in Munich .
Of a rapid drive across Paris to catch a plane after a tense meeting , with the taxi driver on his mobile phone telling his wife he could n't argue with her as he had been instructed to listen to his English passengers are report back to our distributor ( he really should have spoke French to one of us to see if we knew ) .
Of a training course given in a 3D graphics programming library in the remote Swedish town of Arborga , where my married male colleague had to resist the advances of a local pretty boy who took a fancy to him at the monthly disco at the only hotel in town where we were staying .

Java Tag Libraries / how they work / Tomcat Deployment
Related topics : via article database
A Java ( JSP ) tag library is a set of additional XML tags that you can include in your Java Server Page in order to create objects and set and get the attributes of those objects .
Let 's see an example .
I can write the following into my HTML :
< jsp:useBean id =" bigmac " class = " shape .
Cube " />
< jsp:setProperty name= " bigmac " property = " wid " value = " 150 " / >
< jsp:setProperty name= " bigmac " property = " hig " value = " 140 " / >
< jsp:setProperty name= " bigmac " property =" dep " value = " 100 " / >
The Big Mac box has a volume of
<b><jsp:getProperty name= " bigmac " property = " vol " / > and
And that will result in an output like :
The Big Mac box has a volume of 2100 cc and
How does it work ?
The extra tags in the library generate Java Byte Code ( code for the Java Virtual Machine ) even though there is no actual Java source code present ... but there is enough information to describe what the code needs to do - you can consider it to be another language if you like !
Here 's what the alternative source code would look like :
<% shape .
Cube bigmac = new shape .
Cube ( ) ;
bigmac.setWid( " 150 " ) ;
bigmac.setHig( " 140 " ) ;
bigmac.setDep ( " 100 " ) ;
out.print(bigmac.getVol ) ; %gt ;
The whole of the JSP is read by the Tomcat ( or other ) JSP engine , and all the stuff that 's NOT in the Java tags is put into a great big out .
print ( ) and the whole thing is compiled up into a Servlet , which Tomcat then runs .
Where does the calculation logic come from
The constructor for the shape .
Cube object , and the accessor methods , conform to a standard called a Java Bean .
This specifies that there must be a zero parameter constructor , and that there must be methods to save attributes / properties with names starting with set , and to read back properties with names starting with get .
The business logic is within that class , or classes which it in turn calls .
The extra class file is stored within your web application , in teh directory WEB - INF / classes ... and in there in a subdirectory named to match the package name .
The extra class / business logic is loaded when the JSP is loaded .
Here 's the start of the source code of the Java Bean to give you an idea of what it looks like :
package shape ;
public class Cube {
float x ;
float y ;
float z ;
public Cube ( ) {
x = 0.0f ;
y = 0.0f ;
z = 0.0f ;
}
public void setWid( String val ) {
x = Float.parseFloat ( val ) ;
}
Full source code of the JSP - [ here ]
Full source code of the Java Bean - [ here ]
Some Notes
Although the JSP page is rechecked by Tomcat every few seconds , the classes that it calls up are not - they 're cached and assumed to be unchanging .
So that means you 'll need to stop and restart the application if you change the classes , but not if you change the JSP itself .
Note that the attribute names start with a lower case letter , but the method names are camel case with a capital for the attribute name .
For example a property called dep will call up methods setDep and getDep .
You can learn about deploying applications that include pages that use tag libraries like this ( N.B. - also other tage libraries such as Struts and Spring ) on our Deploying Apache / Tomcat course .
And we can teach you how to write pages like this on private Java courses - please email for a few more details , telling me a little of your background .

Through Snow and Flood to Linux and Tomcat
Related topics : via article database
I arrived in Milton Keynes on Sunday night ... to find at 9 p.m. a hotel where they had closed the restaurant early for lack of customers , and after an appalling drive the advertised meal was not to be had .
The final 3 staff took pity on me - one of few customers around , and the only one not in his room - and did me up a bowl of pea and ham soup , and I stood around chatting with them , and with a pint of Guinness as they finished the tidy up .
In hindsight , I had only just made it over from Bicester and Buckingham , watching where other cars were spinning and taking care where I could ; a 20 mile an hour creep extended a ride that would normally take around 25 minutes to between 2 and 3 times that , and I had been glad to see the lights of Milton Keynes .
The conditions were so dire I had n't even thought of taking pictures to show you !
My course is going well - I 'm doing a combined deploying LAMP and Tomcat private course about 4 miles from where I am staying , but even that journey is interesting .
See at the top of this item ... this morning 's picture of the car ( I have Lisa 's this week - pretty , but impractical in the snow ) , and the floods which Lisa is probably happy that I declined to take it through - that picture taken just a hundred yards from where I am training .

Huawei D100 Wireless Router - Mobile Internet
Related topics : via article database Useful link : Linux training
I am writing up my experiences as I found it very hard to get this information when I asked ;-) - but " management summary " - this will be a very positive product review .
What is the Huawei D100 Wireless Router ?
It connect the 3 mobile phone broadband wireless network ( which according to the 3 blurb covers almost all of the population ) into your own local area Wifi network .
Basically , two sets of wireless in one box - one to connect to " 3 " and the other to connect your own local devices .
It also has an RJ45 ethernet connector so you can plug in a wired ethernet device .
How does the Huawei D100 Router work ?
The Router has a USB slot in it into which you plug your 3 Dongle , and that provides a wide area network connection in very much the same way that the router we use to provide our regular broadband connection at home - except that the output is to mobile broadband rather that to cable ( main home connection ) or ISDN ( our backup connection via another device ) .
The router provides a regular local area wifi connection ( protected with a WEP key ) and includes a DHCP server through which it can issue IP addresses .
Initial configuration is to provide 101 IP addresses ( 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.200 ) .
It has its own IP address ( default 192.168.1.1 ) and a browser interface there through which it can be configured .
It forwards DNS requests too so that you can point your DNS at 192.168.1.1 and it will ' play ' for you .
If you have a wired device you want to connect , you can plug this into the RJ45 port and use it via there .
I have connected a hub , and been able to connect multiple devices .
Devices which are manually configured with IP addresses on the same network ( but not part of the DHCP range ) ARE able to reach the wide area connection .
Some myths exploded
Some documentation talks about the router having a built in battery , but that is incorrect - it required power , and comes with a conventional external plug and adaptor .
I suspect someone was overoptimistic in the product spec .
The device can be used ( I 'm doing it as I write this article ) to connect a box running Linux ; it is not limited to Vista , XP , 2000 and the most recent 2 versions of OSX .
But beware - the rule is different for a dongle on its own ( no D100 router ) and it is just possible that something has to be initialised in the dongle that does require one of the specified operating systems at that point ( I did my initial setup direct to a suitable laptop ) .
Words of caution
I understand that only certain specific models of dongle , which are some ( but not all ) of the ones that work on the 3 network , will operate correctly with the D100 .
I have yet to establish whether or not the ethernet cable needs to be crossed - I can't at this stage provide easy advice as the hub I have connected is autosensing /
I have purchased a 5
Gb per month package which should do well for my needs , but I am very much aware that there is an excess charge beyond that which I believe to be quite steep , and I can not at this stage give an easy comment on my usage .
Good Stuff
Well ... here you go :
With a hub , here is the setup I had running yesterday evening in my hotel .
There 's a Mac OS X machine and a Linux system both connected at the same time ; I 'm running wired - primarily for testing - and both machines are online .
I have switched the router 's IP address to the same one we normally use back at base , and it 's serving IP addresses in its class C address range .
I also have my Linux eee PC baby connecting in wireless ...
a) The Router will let me get connect in my complete wired training network should I wish to do so and this gives me the option of providing delegates with a complete internet access at our machines in their own offices without the need for me to connect my kit behind their firewall .
Clearly , this facility has to be offered only on UK courses , and we must add " subject to availability of mobile broadband in the training room " - should be OK for the vast majority of sites ; problems only at a few geographic locations , and where the building is in effect a Faraday cage - we get those occasionally !
b ) The Router can provide a mobile backup internet service at both our HQ and Well House Manor , meaning that on any occasions that the cable connection is down ( quite rare ) , we have an alternative service ... and we 'll be able to retire the ISDN router / ' modem ' that we currently have for the purpose
c ) The router also provides an interconnection between the various wireless and wired devices connected to it ... so it 's working ( as I probably could have guessed ) as a home hub too , rather than as a hotel or public access facility where the users are kept separate .

Mobile Internet - an alternative to hotel WiFi
Related topics : via article database
I 'm no longer playing " Hunt the Wifi " network , nor " Guess how long you want to connect " or " Which signal will last " when I 'm away within the UK ... having spent 200 pounds on access through various systems from various UK hotels last year alone , I took the plunge and got myself a 3G Dongle giving me internet access from more or less any UK hotel I 'm likely to be in ( fingers crossed on that ! ) for fifteen quid a month for up to 5 Bytes of traffic which should cover me for most month of around 5 to 10 days away .
First test - it works at home .
Second test - it works at Well House Manor .
Third test - it works at the Milton Keynes hotel .
First pleasant surprise - it 's quite quick compared to what I had expected .
Second pleasant surprise - I can now get online from wherever I 'm training - Faraday Cages and company rules excepted .
Third pleasant surprise - the router box that I bought with it , sight unseen , does some rather interesting things and gives some new possibilities .
On line information about the Huawei D100 Wireless Router sucks , and talking via interactive chat on the 3 web site with their evening assistant revealed that either the limited online data was wrong , or that she did n't know and was making odd technical guesses - I 'm glad I came to the conclusion that the latter was the case , gambled and bought one ... and indeed I 'll share what I have learned to help other out ... link on to main story ( or scroll up if you 're on the blog as it will be the next article ! )

The final step to being British
Related topics : via article database
It 's over ten years since Lisa moved to the UK , and she 's been British for over half of that time ... but there have been just a few experiences which have taken a while to happen .
Last night , I took her to her first panto and she had the experience of the leading boy , the pantomime dame , " He 's behind you " , the audience interaction , the children up on the stage , the topical and local cracks , the naughty jokes aimed over the heads of the kiddies , and the village hall that starts off cold and draughty and lacking in atmosphere , yet becomes abuzz during the show with real atmosphere .
I also had the opportunity to introduce her to some characters from my childhood - and other later characters - who had n't quite made in to the USA when she lived there .
Now let 's see how they all ended up ...
Andy Pandy and Goldilocks discover that - oops - they have an unexpected romantic attachment that 's going to break the pairings that we have all been lead to expect .
Looby Lou has always had a thing for Bob the Builder , and the two of them end up together
Chip the woodcutter 's son , who was all cut out to be paired off with Goldilocks , has been swept off his feet by Peaches ( one of the St Trinian 's girls ) who has taken him under her wing as he searches for Goldilocks .
It was after they bunked for the night in the same tent , with the magic corks , when everyone dreamed of their true love .
Baby Bear Fozzy Bear - who turned out to be one of the unexpected anchors of the show who really made the evening - has found his Cuddles who appeared ( out of the chorus line ! ) during his dream that night in the woods !
There must have been a cast of forty !
SuperTed , Spotty Man , Skeleton , Bulk and Texas Pete ... and let 's not forget PC Plod , Bill and Ben the Flowerpot Men , Little Weed , the narrator , Scoop ... and a guest appearance from the Mayor of Melksham playing himself !
Final shows - a matinee this afternoon , and an evening performance at 7:30 .
See here .
And you can find Melksham Comedy Club 's home page here for other productions through the year ... or for details of next year 's panto in due course .

Things people say on the phone
Related topics : via article database
I phoned up the local county council to report this depression in the road Well House Manor , and the young lady I spoke to told me she would send someone round in the next couple of weeks to " look into it " .
I am just imagining this group of engineers standing around , all looking down the hole ..
Last night , I spoke with another lady on the phone about something completely different , and she put me on hold using the words " bare with me " ...
Hmmm ... sound fun , but I do n't know the lady in question well enough to do something like that .
Have you ever been on the phone with someone , and had them come up with the phrase " well - to be honest with you ?
Does it mean that everything they said previously has been lies ?

Who sticks by you in the snow ?
Related topics : via article database
There are those businesses who will go out of their way to continue to provide a the best service they can in the inclement weather , and there are those who will abandon even their regular customers in the snow - " fair weather friends " .
It 's been interesting to learn who falls into which group this morning !
One of our team lives in Chippenham , and has a car which sometimes plays up .
But - no big deal - there 's a train from Chippenham to Melksham at 06:30 which will ' do very nicely ' , thank you .
Except that , this morning with 3 inches of snow , they decided to abandon their services via Melksham completely .
And no suggestion of alternatives on their web site .
So I drove in and took over the early shift .
Newspapers had n't arrived at the local garage when I popped in on my way in to the hotel this morning ( see - the roads are open for me ! ) ... but they went that extra mile and phoned me when they had arrived - " I thought it would still be in time for your guests " they said and we truly appreciate their thoughtfulness .
I called our regular Baguette supplier to order a delivery of lunches for today - being the last day of the course , we want to keep the lunch break down .
But , alas , they have abandoned their customer base when they 're most needed and are n't doing deliveries today , even though the roads were perfectly passable by lunch time
It would be easy enough for me to jump in the car and collect , but I popped round to the Spa Road garage instead , even though I had hoped to serve something slightly more upmarket that Spar wraps .

Melksham Climate Friendly Group
Related topics : via article database
It 's somewhat ironic that I left last night 's meeting of Melksham Climate Friendly Group in a bit of a blizzard .
Many familiar faces , a great deal of knowledge , and a group each of whom is taking a real interest in some aspect of the subject in their own way , with a strong and effective chair pulling together in joint efforts and coordinating with neighbouring areas and other organisations .
A packed 2 hour agenda - a lot discussed from Energy monitors that the TIC will be loaning out to households , through the gardening association , renewable energy , the economies and carbon footprint of recycling , bees , what to do with leftover food , 20 future technologies , and a " vision for 2020 " competition that 's to be run to raise awareness .
Not to forget the idea of turning the wasteland beside the " West End " into a sensory garden , their stall on 14th February and their coffee morning on 28th .
There are strong views in Melksham ( as elsewhere ! ) on the plastic bag issue , and it was interesting to hear comments and view on this and on other matters .
The safety of the new low power electric lights that we 're being forced to use .
Two concerns - the mercury level therein , which is said to be very low , and some medical issues that some people are said to have with them .
I was well impressed by the group 's background research ( and following up of contacts ) to check out the medical story .
I think they see me as " Mr Transport " ;-) .
A good chance given to me ( Thank you , madam chairman ) to update them on the subject and some useful thoughts in terms of publicity , some of which I 'm sure you 'll see much more of - especially if you live on the TransWilts corridor - over coming weeks and months .
The ' train campaign ' has been a little out of the public eye for the last few months , but things have been happening behind the scenes and we 're pressing for an appropriate service from this coming December .
Only last week there was a meeting between the County Council and First Great Western ( I am now told by FGW , so I can share ! ) , and only yesterday I was in correspondence with some of their senior managers with a view to smoothing the way .
The group makes an impression with the local press - a relatively active web site ( though scope for more traffic - have n't we all ? ) , and certainly some folks to be working * with * towards mutual goals ; I brought up the potential growth of this area in the next 15 years under the regional spatial strategy and indeed there is a need to look forward for all across the community - not only in terms of transport but also in association with business , in association with the schools ( oops - THAT subject was left of my list of what was on their agenda ! ) , and with many other local groups .
Here 's to a flourishing Melksham , taking a sensible level of measures to doing our bit to being planet friendly .
The Melksham Climate Friendly Group meets at the Spencer Sports and Social Club on the Beanacre Road out of Melksham at 8 p.m. on the first Wednesday of each month .
And I am sure , dear reader , that you would be given as friendly a welcome as I was if you go along .

Injection Attack if register_globals in on - PHP
Related topics : via article database
You may have heard me talk about " injection attacks " and that having register_globals set to on in PHP makes you liable to be caught by them .
Well - that 's a little bit dramatic as you can write perfectly safe PHP scripts with the setting on if you 're careful .
Here 's an example of a script which is not secured ...
<? php
$ fields = array ( " name " , " town " , " nkids " ) ;
$ connection = mysql_connect ( " 127.0.0.1 " , " trainee " , " abc123 " ) ;
mysql_select_db(" graham " , $connection ) ;
$rs = mysql_query ( " select * from people " ) ;
$ table .= " < table > " ;
while ( $row = mysql_fetch_assoc( $rs ) ) {
$ table .= " < tr > " ;
foreach ( $ fields as $ column ) {
$ table .= " < td > " . $row [ $ column ] . " < /td > " ;
}
$ table .= " < /tr > " ;
}
$ table .= " < /table > " ;
/* ------------------------------------------- */ ?>
< html >
< head >< title > Class of '08</ title ></head >
< body >
< h1 > Here they are </ h1 >
<?= $ table ?>
< br >
All together doing MySQL !
</ body >
</html >
Now the output SHOULD look like this :
But I can make it look like this ... VERY easily !
Did you spot the extra line of text ?.
What has happened ?
I have used the $ table variable to build up my table , using the " dot equals " operator .
Fine - except that I have used it the very first time that the variable is references which means that in inherits any form values that are input via a box called table on the form that calls up the script .
So all I have to do is to write such a form and I can add whatever I like at that point .. which could just be text ... or it might be Javascript I want echoed out , font changes , code to call up an image ....
The solution is to change the first " dot equals " into just " equals " .
That 's the good programming solution .
But turning register_globals off also solves the problem , as the variable would not then be populated from the form .
The best solution ?
do both !.

Carry on Training - in spite of the weather
Related topics : via article database Useful link : PHP training
Public Transport Chaos yesterday - the newspaper headlines tell us of the London bus system shut down , and our own status report page on First Great Western 's train services show that they too had major issues ( but congratulations to them for managing to run even a reduced service ) .
But our training courses are carrying right on without any interruption - that 's the advantage of having residential facilities !
In fact - at times like this thank goodness for our rooms .
We can just sit back and enjoy the beauty of the snow ; here are some pictures from this morning .
Our hotel and training center - Well House Manor , at 48 , Spa Road , Melksham , Wiltshire .
Our HQ is a part of one of the Melksham Spa buildings - we 're at 404 , The Spa , Melksham , Wiltshire .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Beautiful and intelligent , and balancing a modern outlook with a deep concern for her people , Jordan 's Queen Rania seems in many ways to represent the optimistic face of the Middle East 's future .
Not just a pretty face : Queen Rania has used her position to fight for better education for Jordanian youth .
Since she entered the spotlight after she married then Prince Abdullah in 1993 , she has become known for her philanthropic work , pushing for better educational facilities for Jordan 's school children and supporting efforts to empower women .
Feted by the West ( she has been interviewed countless times , including a half - hour appearance on Oprah ) , she was named the third most beautiful woman in the world by Harpers and Queen magazine in 2005 .
She has used her considerable status -- Forbes magazine ranks her 81 in the world 's 100 most powerful women -- to correct what she sees as misconceptions in the West about the Arab world .
A beacon of hope then in a troubled region ?
Not exactly .
The reality behind the picture perfect image is more complex .
To a large extent Queen Rania remains a paradox -- a symbol of the contradictions that still blight the region as it tries to come to terms with modernity .
She is the business graduate who left her job at a multinational to marry into a monarchy that has ruled Jordan for the last 60 years , at times with an iron rod .
She may talk passionately about freedom of speech and equal rights .
Yet Jordan 's own human rights record under the stewardship of her husband King Abdullah II has hardly been exemplary , and has included accusations of terrorist suspects being tortured , harsh laws to clamp down on public dissent and the arrest without trial of critics of the government .
Jordan also has one of the highest incidences in the Middle East of honor killings -- the practice of women being killed by male family members if they engage in pre-martial sex .
To her credit , Rania is not burying her head in the sand over the problems of Jordan .
She acknowledges , for example , that unemployment rates among young people stand at 25 percent , double the global average , and that " creating jobs is one of the most important priorities for us . "
The daughter of Palestinian parents , she is also acutely aware of the severe social problems that conflict has created in the wider region .
She talks about a " hope - gap " in trouble spots such as Iraq and Palestinian areas , where young people can be sucked into a vortex of violence and where there are few , if any opportunities to rescue them .
" It 's all about providing that opportunity , a sense of hope for the future generation because I believe that if that future generation is growing without that sense of hope , then we are looking at a very dangerous situation . "
Faced with so many complexities in the current political and social climate in the Middle East , it 's perhaps not that surprising that Rania is focusing so much of her energy on young people .
As well as efforts to improve education , she has initiated an online debate on the video sharing site YouTube .
The queen is asking viewers to send in comments about their ideas of Islam and the Arab world .
She then appears and discusses her reaction to the comments .
The conversation is due to run until International Youth Day on August 12 .
" When I 'm in the West I 'm asked why do the Arabs hate us ?
When I'm in the Arab world I hear very negative comments about the West , " she told CNN .
" The rising tensions between both sides is a fact of life , I do n't think that anyone can deny it . "
She wanted to take the debate online and ask young people to participate in order to " bring them into the conversation because they are the ones that can change the discourse . "
She said the Internet is a force for free speech , and that greater communications are making it harder for authoritarian regimes to stifle dialogue .
" If you do n't like the comments that are out there the best way to tackle it is to respond to them and to put your side of the story . "
A mother - of - four , she believes that young people should be allowed to be involved in the political process , not only because she is concerned they 're being denied a voice but also because she says she thinks they have a huge amount to offer .
She said young people need to be seen as " active agents as opposed to just persons in the making and to do that we really need to educate them , engage them and empower them in the decision - making process . "
That her idealistic pronouncements can seem at odds with the reality on the ground is not surprising , given just how difficult that reality is .
That she cares enough to try and make difference is only to her credit .
Times editor Dana Jennings writes each week about coping with an advanced form of prostate cancer .
I ’m tired .
I found out 10 months ago that I had prostate cancer .
Since then , I ’ve had surgery , started hormone therapy and finished 33 sessions of radiation .
And , man , it wears you out .
But the weariness caused by prostate cancer is n’t a constant .
It fluctuates from week to week , day to day , even hour to hour .
In this nano - age of super - instant gratification , we have lost sense of organic time .
Prostate cancer , though , has planted me more firmly in each moment .
One of the things that I ’ve learned , as I try to pay attention , is that cancer ’s paint box includes many shades of fatigue .
It starts with the diagnosis .
Knowing that you have cancer exhausts you , stuns you into listlessness .
Even so , there ’s work to be done .
There are doctors to be interrogated , a host of tests and scans to be had , treatment decisions to wrestle with and insurers to kick in the shins .
With all that going on , it ’s hard to get a good night ’s sleep .
Next there ’s the physical fatigue of treatment .
I spent three nights in the hospital after my surgery , and that was the time I experienced fatigue that ’s beyond fatigue , a fatigue so palpable it seems you could touch it .
I wanted to shrivel into the fetal curl of a woolly - bear caterpillar , spin a cocoon of sleep and tell my doctors to wake me when it was time to leave .
I learned that sleep is bliss , that sleep heals , that sleep is the essential post - op drug .
At home , I had to accept that my fatigue was in charge .
Mornings were especially slow as I creaked and winced out of bed .
I felt like an old car that needed to have its crankcase oil heated before it would start .
I soon learned that just shuffling around the block can be draining , that there ’s power in the spontaneous nap , and that you need to set strict visiting hours .
Your fatigue – your body – needs what it needs .
But just because you ’re spent , it does n’t mean you can sleep at night .
I became buddies with the sleep that is n’t sleep , staked to my bed by pain and anxiety .
No matter where I tucked the pillows , I could n’t get comfortable .
No matter how good the music murmuring from the CD player , I could n’t be soothed .
( Is that a blood clot floating in my catheter tube ? )
A prescription sleeping pill helped solve those problems .
For the sake of my wife ’s repose ( and sanity ) , we decided to sleep in separate beds for two weeks , until I felt better and the catheter was out .
I also dozed off where I least expected to .
During radiation , I sometimes napped inside the TomoTherapy machine , lulled in my lassitude by Pink Floyd and Metallica .
It was the radiation , which lasted more than seven weeks , that resulted in the most profound fatigue .
Toward the end , I was totally washed out .
I felt worn down , like a pencil nub that could n’t possibly be sharpened one more time .
It was hard to focus – on reading , on work – I was n’t listening as well , my legs were heavy .
It took just one stout with supper to knock me out for the night .
Even now , a month after my last radiation session , the fatigue still swells late in the afternoon and breaks over me .
When 5 o’clock rolls around I ’m more zombie than employee .
I ’m in bed by 10 most nights .
And weekend naps are nonnegotiable .
There ’s one more subtle shade of fatigue : the fatigue of talking about your cancer .
From the diagnosis , through treatment and after , the well - meaning questions seem to never stop .
How are you feeling ?
What ’s your Gleason ?
Where ’s your P.S.A.?
Will you need chemo ?
It sometimes feels as if you have become your cancer or , at the very least , its spokesman .
And it can be wearing .
But I found that it ’s crucial to shake off that languor and learn to speak .
Sleep heals , but talking heals , too .
Like Scheherazade and her 1,001 nights of stories , I think we tell our tales so that we , and others , can stay alive — no matter how tired we might get .
German boffins at the famed Fraunhofer Institutes - developers of mp3 audio compression , among other things - are now working on another critical technology .
To wit : bearings covered in ultrahard coatings of artificial diamond .
Slick as ice .
The remorselessly efficient brainboxes of the Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials ( Institut Werkstoffmechanik , IWM ) in Freiburg call their new gemstone - dip DLC , for Diamond Like Coating .
" Thanks to this coating , we can produce components that are much more robust than conventional elements , " says IWM's Dr Sven Meier .
" The coated bearings remain sturdy even if they are not sufficiently lubricated or if they run dry ...
Our coating method is also suitable for geometrically complex parts , such as bearing cages . "
Makers of fancy mechanical watches have long used bearings made from jewels , in modern times often artificial sapphire - but diamond has been used too .
The idea here is to reduce friction and so make the watch more accurate as much as to increase the bearings ' life .
That application , however , is becoming more and more irrelevant in an era where much more accurate quartz watches are cheap - and mobile phones can often read sat nav or internet time signals .
But the Fraunhofer lads are aiming at much wider application .
They can already coat individual plastic ball - bearings in a sphere of hard , tough diamond as much as 0.02 millimetres in thickness : and they reckon to apply their process to other materials soon .
The IWM statement mentions " bicycles , slide bearings in the crankshafts of ships , or high - performance bearings in motor sports " .
They do admit , however , that at the moment the " precious coatings " involve " high costs " .
It would seem that for now a diamondball - bearing , while better than a soft golden one , might cost at least as much . ®
Our request is to ask you to bring Democracy and Justice full - circle .
For a Democracy is not that ... if those who willingly chose to subvert , distort and ignore it are permitted to enjoy the benefits of freedoms and decency that they denied others for eight long secretive , torturous and needless death - filled years .
You know of whom I speak : George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , David Addington , John Woo , Karl Rove , Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , etc .
For these men to retire to their luxurious mansions and pristine golf courses without repercussions for their lies , their disdain for our Constitution and finally for their crimes against humanity would be a travesty of Democracy , a travesty of Justice and would certainly lessen the significance of the people 's victory on November 4 .
We respectfully ask that you open a full - investigation into the Bush Administration 's past governmental activities .
We know they broke the laws many times .
It ’s been documented , reported and archived .
However , these men must be held accountable for their actions .
If action is taken in this direction , then our Democracy is working .
It means that you cannot break the law and get away with it even if you are the King or a subject in the King 's Court .
You can not twist the laws of this country .
You are not entitled to make any rules that you desire just because you wear a crown .
Following the laws of our Constitution and displaying simple human decency are what separate the United States from the rest of the world .
We must restore the Constitution .
We must punish the King for being a King in what was designed to be a Federal Constitutional Republic .
They have willingly broken the laws of our Founding Fathers .
They must atone .
We realize you have more urgent matters to attend to first .
The economy being of that upmost importance at this time but we ask you to devote some time to this too .
It is a long process .
It will cost money we do n’t have .
However , we guarantee you it will be money well spent .
If you proceed , you will have support from the majority of Americans and you will have served your country as the Founding Fathers intended .
A million innocent Iraqi civilians and 4191 American soldiers will have not died in vain .
Close the circle that you drew for us on Nov. 4 . 2008 .
Close it so this country can begin anew in all the just ways and finally close it for any future Presidents who might try to govern under the same lawless and despicable policies .

Archives > 2008 > October > Pepsi Tests New 8 - pack to See if Smaller is Better
Maybe I should n't be surprised .
After all , the notion of " change " has become quite popular this year .
So what can we expect to see next ?
According to the St. Petersburg Times , Pepsi will phase - out 2 - liter bottles in favor 1.5 .
It will also replace those 20 - ounce bottles we often buy at the gas station with 12 - ounce plastic bottles and 16 - ouncecans .
John Sicher , publisher of Beverage Digest , said the industry " overused " the 12 - pack , and that Pepsi 's latest move is just the first of many transition tests that consumers will see .
Dahncke overlooked many possible contributing factors for the sales slump - including health .
An obesity epidemic and an increase in juvenile diabetes cases have combined to raise the public 's concern for healthier lifestyles .
I 'm sure you have a few friends or family members who removed soda from their diet or drastically reduced their daily intake of carbonated beverages .
Want proof the 12 - pack - which accounts for half of all soft drink sales - outlived its appeal ?
Even when Pepsi cut prices , sales volume was only half what it used to be .
A 6 - pack is convenient if you 're heading to the beach or having a grill - out with a couple friends , and the 12 - pack was perfect to throw in the fridge for a week 's supply .
Unless I stock - up , buying an 8 - pack means I 'll be heading back to the grocery store within a couple days .
Evidently , I 'm not the only consumer who hates the new packaging .
Pepsi spokesmen Jeff Dahncke claims the 12 - pack is a thing of the past .
He told the St. Petersburg Times .
Pepsi claims higher prices for energy and food combined to raise expenses by 11 % /
They 're betting the 8 - pack will appear as a better value to consumers .
Who does Pepsi think they 're fooling ?
The 8 - pack might be easier to carry around , but that 's where the " value " ends for me .
I 'm used to paying about $ 3.50 to $ 4.50 for a 12 - pack , $ 10 for three 12 - packs during specials .
I just paid $ 3.50 for the new 8 - pack at Publix , which shows that Pepsi is out of touch with the average shopper .
During your last trip to the grocery store , you may have noticed a few changes in the soft drink aisle .
If you 're a fan of Pepsi , Mug Root Beer , Sierra Mistor Mountain Dew , you probably already know what I 'm talking about .
Pepsi Bottling Group has officially applied the " smaller is better " philosophy to its packaging .
The 12 - pack we 've all become accustomed to has been temporarily phased - out and replaced by an 8 - pack in 20 % of America 's stores , including the state of Florida , my home state .
( 54 ) Thoughts on Pepsi Tests New 8 - pack to See if Smaller is Better
If Mr. Dahncke is correct , I 've bought my last Diet Dr. Pepper .
I have one 12 - pack the frig in my garage .
When it 's gone , I 'm done drinking Pepsi products -- until they bring back the 12 - pack .

My family and have been extremely loyal Pepsi product customers ...
However , if this 8 - pack and
18 - pack cube bullsh !# does n't cease pretty soon , we 'll all be taking our business elsewhere .
Not only do we almost exclusively buy Pepsi products in the supermarkets , gas stations , convenient stores and vending machines , we also purposely seek out and dine in restaurants and frequent bars / nightclubs , etc. that are pro Pepsi ...
And buy the way , who the bloody F-- K does Pepsi think they 're kidding with this " Less is Better " fu#@ig approach ???
What Marketing genious thought of this utter bulls %!t?...
They are obviously taking the Global Market for a bunch of collective fools ...
This is just another scheme for the executive " Fat Cats " and greedy shareholders to pad their bank accounts and doing so when our economy is in a serious quandry .
How ruthless will they get ?
Well , I , for one , will not stand for it !
I guess if I have to resort to acting childish with the millions of Worldwide anti-Pepsi blogging campaign efforts I will help to start and continue to angrily " run-a - muck " with , then , I might as well also revert back to my childhood beverage ... " Cool Aid ! " - " OH , YEHH !!! "
( Besides , children never seemed to get fat in the old days drinking Cool Aid , which was made with a mere cup of sugar VS .
the 6 - 9 some - odd tables of sugar compounds found in the average full calorie soft drink product ! )
So , as far as Pepsi 's fuck - d - up reasoning about their supposed concern over their consumer 's ; health issues ...
I say , ( in the famous words of T.V. character Frank Barrone of " Everybody Loves Raymond " -
" What a load of crap ! " Pepsi , nor any other soft drink company in the history of soda pop has given a " rat 's a $ $ " about anyone 's health , with possibly the exception of Faygo ( who has always attempted to produce low - calorie substitutions ) ; everyone else out on the market is interested in only one thing ...
Creating an addictive " CASH COW " -
And don't
let anybody make you think differently !
Come on people , wake up and smell the cola nut !...
Or , at least smell this great , big pile of manure Pepsi 's trying to sell us !
Use your self - control ...
Fight back !...
And Boycott these pin heads until we get back our 12 and 24 packs !.
" 12/24 - We want more ! " ...
" 12/24 - We want more ! " ...
!2/24 - We want more ! " .... " 12/24 -...

This attempt to fool the american consumer by Pepsi is quite ridiculous .
I recently purchased an 8 pack of diet pepsi for $ 3.39 .
That equals $ 0.42 per can .
At that price a 12 pack would cost $ 5.08 !
So , Pepsi , how is less more for us , the consumer .
I only see this working in your favor .
You provide less product and we pay you more money .
And in regards to you attempt on reducing production cost is all smoke and mirrors as well .
If the volumetric demand for your product remains at its current rate and you reduce the size of your containers you will need to utilize more resources to meet your bottling and canning needs .
Think of it this way .
If I go through 6 liters of Soda a week I will buy 3,2 - liter bottles .
To purchase the same amount in 1.5 - liter bottles I will need to buy 4 bottles .
This would equal 52 more bottles a year that I would have to purchase causing me to absorb your over all higher bottling cost .
if you would like to user the less is more approach uses it effectively as it was intended to be used .
Use less resources by using larger containers .

In case you did n't know it is not all Pepsi who makes the pricing .
Pepsi recommends a $ 2.99 regular price for the 8 - pack in each of their stores .
It is Publix who then takes that price and add the extra to it to make it $ 3.39 .
It is Publix who is the one running the scam .
Publix where shopping is better and more expensive .
The 8 pack is a cheaper price per can at $ .37 .
A 12 pack at regular price is $ 4.89 at $.41 per can .
Pepsi is actually making it cheaper per can .
Do the math before you complain .
It is just people not willing to change .
Blame Publix not Pepsi .

PBG can package however they want and charge whatever they want for all I care .
I am ignoring PBG products until they stop making Pepsi with HFCS .
Until then , they can just hang and I 'll find my sugar made soda elsewhere .
Comments by 2oonhed : Monday , November 10 , 2008 at 07:11 AM
You people need to invest in a calculator .
The idea is to have $ 2.99 every day retail .
Which is $ .37 per can .
Publix sold the 12 pack off add at $ 4.79 , that $ .39 a can .
If Publix would get on the program like every other retailer the math works out for the consumer .
Go to Wal - Mart and buy them for $ 2.50 , that 's $.31 a can and find something else to bitch about !
.39
.37

I myself have switched to publix 12 packs here in fla , 2.50 each and taste ok , so screw pepsi .
Comments by Steve : Thursday , November 20 , 2008 at 11:14 PM
you know their motivation behind this .. the slightly lower price of the 8 pack is better for the impulse purchase ..
even though people know they 're getting 8 cans , subconsciously the lower price overrules it .
They expect us to overlook the fact we 're actually paying a higher price by volume .. for a company that produces so many cans per day , if they can make us pay for an extra can by buying an 8 pack , it adds up quite fast .. they 're getting their bailout in a slightly hidden way .. either way it comes out of our a**es .
It reminds me also of the genius idea of the bread manufacturers to only package hot dog buns in packs of 8 .. so when you buy a pack of 10 hot dogs you of course need more than one pack of buns to cover it .
But then what with the extra buns ?
more dogs !!
then more buns , more dogs more buns !
So now if we need 12 cans we have to buy 2 - 8 packs .. and they profit due to the higher volume cost .
Believe me , Pepsi is like any other business .. they are n't concerned about the health of the nation enough to suggest we buy less of their product ...

Great subject Matt .
I agree with the comments , soda should be in 12 packs !!
8 cans is n't enough , and we do n't like change .
Comments by Tiffany Compton : Friday , December 05 , 2008 at 10:45 PM
Once Pepsi brought about the 8 can box and stopped offering 12 can , I began getting the Coke 12 packs routinely .
Prior to that I would go back and forth between brands depending on price .
I figure Pepsi's blunder means approx 100.00 I do n't spend a year on Pepsi .
I like Pepsi more , but I can deal with drinking Coke regularly rather then be bamboozled .

Purely on principle , I always wait for a great sale , like $ 1.99 - $ 2.50 for the 12 - pack cases at places like gas stations which seem to have sales like this about every
2 - 3 months on the average where I live in the Ft. Lauderdale , FL. area to purchase my Pepsi Products ...
( I never pay more than $ 3.00 bucks a 12 - pack ! )
Then , I 'll go hog-assed wild and purchase an absolutely obscene amount , usually around 50 +++ cases !...
( What can I say , we have a large Irish - Catholic family and we tend to entertain a lot ! )
This 8 - pack & 12 - pack situation " ain't - gonna - fly " around here , Pepsi !-
We 'll be buying anything and everything that we can find in a 12 or 24 - pack case until " kingdom Come " or until you meet our demands !... ( Remember - I 'm principled when it comes to my purchases ! )
Especially now , in this economy !!!

I have seen this many times over with other products .
They reduce the size but leave the larger size price intact .
They say they are saving you the trouble of a price increase .
I guess the same price for less product is not more .
The sad part comes down the road when they have slid the scenario of gettin less for the same price into an accepted practice .
THAT'S WHEN THE ACTUAL PRICE INCREASE IS INTRODUCED .
Thus the companies wack the consumer with a double whammy .
It is done with the smiling face and show of concern for the consumer .

What a bunch of sheep ... either accept times are tough and they are trying to keep prices the same , or buy into a bunch of rhetoric .
You know as well as I do that Pepsi is the better soda if you are a Pepsi lover .
My wife does not agree , loyal Coke drinker .
We also only drink a few sodas a week ... less than 5 .
They are bad for you , they are an indulgence .
Break out the glass , fill it with water as your staple , and enjoy a tasty beverage ( beer , scotch , Pepsi ) when appropriate .
You have not been cut off from your life - line , you are paying more in a bad economy .

Here 's a theory : Pepsi just want you and the many obese people who drink far too much garbage to drink less softdrinks .
The reason for the 8 pack is also that because their consumers are so unfit : they 're worried about a lawsuit when they claim a strained back from unloading the 10 value packs of pepsi and boxes of wings dipped in peanut butter and triple marinated in bacon fat that they 'll be washing down .
Here 's a thought : try drinking water ( tap water mind you ) or perhaps fruit juice .
Whinging about having your bulk sugar fix made somewhat less bulk is hilarious .
" Oh you can't charge more for your product , it must stay price fixed for all eternity or else how else can I maintain my huge girth " .
They may have just saved you from a heart attack at 30 .

You 'll be glad you did and this ' less is more ' shit wo n't bother you at all .

People are going to stop buying it because the 12 - pack is gone ?
What the heck is wrong with people ?
I 've never bought soda without checking the price - per-can .
It does n't make a lick of difference to me if it comes in 8 , 12 , or 17 packs .
Comments by Christian Buhl : Sunday , March 08 , 2009 at 02:19 PM
what gets me is the fact that they say that prices for energy and food combined to raise expenses by 11 % so they had to cut it down to 8 - packs but how much did they spend on the new logo ?
even tho its the same they had to pay someone top dollar to think it up and change .
you wanna cut back on spending the cut back the bonus money that you throw at guys making millions already they dont need it they are fine with what they have thats where you f-ing up pepsi .
GIVE US THE REAL REASON

really ??
It 's that upsetting ?
I wish i had such a smooth life that this was the only thing to worry about .
did you stop drinking Pepsi and Coke discarded 16 oz returnables ?
Did you stop drinking it when they stopped using sugar for corn syrup ?
Did you stop drinking coffee when it went to a 36 oz can from 48 ?
get a grip folks .

Yea , how'd you know ?
Maybe my family will get rich from lawsuit due to my untimely death because of Pepsi .
My life WAS smooth up till then .
How can I ever continue ...
Comments by Steve : Thursday , June 25 , 2009 at 01:14 PM
Try this one here in California ... I usually buy the diet dr pepper in those little 12 oz bottles that come in the 12 pack for 4.99 .
I go in today and they are now in 8 packs and are 5.99 .. so we lost 4 bottles and the price went up !!!
So instead of spending $ 5.00 to get through the week I will have to buy 2 8 packs and spend $ 12.00 I do n't mind the cans , but I have gotten ahold of some that taste like the can and they go flat faster .
Seems the sales are going to go down .. I will not buy anymore unless it is a darn good price !!!

The mold With the together and gathered legs , the woman tends of flank and backwards relaxes her head while he penetrates it , or by the vagina or the anus ( excellent position for anal sex ) the movements must smooth and be coordinated and the slow and deep penetration : both bodies are conformed like two perfect pieces of a puzzle ...

Senate to announce investigation of torture under Bush , senators say John Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 25 , 2009
Print This Email This Click for Update : March ' middle ground ' hearing will probe for Bush admin abuses
The Senate is quietly preparing plans to investigate allegations of torture under President George W. Bush , according to comments published Wednesday by Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy ( D - VT ) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) .
The Senate Judiciary Committee could announce a hearing to consider various plans to probe allegations of torture as early as today , according to Salon 's Mark Benjamin , citing Committee Chairman Pat Leahy and members of his staff .
Leahy 's office told Raw Story Wednesday morning that a press release would be sent out shortly .
Sen .
Whitehouse said hes convinced  the investigation will move forward .
 Stay on this ,  he told Benjamin .
 This is going to be big . 
Whitehouse , Senator from Rhode Island , is spearheading  the efforts ,
and as a member of both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees , is
privy to information about interrogations he cant yet share ,  the magazine noted .
Plans to establish the commission still remain in their infancy , as senators and staff look at previous panels , such as the 9 - 11 Commission , and investigations following Watergate .
Whitehouse , a former U.S. attorney , noted that a torture commission might need the power to immunize witnesses on a case - by - case basis .
The prospect of future prosecutions , he said , are beside the point .
Most important was putting a spotlight on abuses committed by the Bush administration .
Leahy previously suggested a truth commission could be modeled after
a panel that probed apartheid in South Africa .
The commission should
have subpoena power and witnesses would not face charges except if
they commit perjury , " he told The Wall Street Journal earlier this
month .
Essentially , witnesses would get prosecutorial immunity in exchange for the truth .
President Barack Obama has vowed his administration wont torture
terror suspects and said prosecutions should be brought in clear
instances of wrongdoing .
But he has also said ,  Im more interested
in looking forward than I am in looking backward . 
Whitehouse , however , predicted that Obama would not object to a torture commission moving forward in Congress .
" When you look at the economic meltdown that [ Obama ] was left by the Bush administration , you can see why he would want to reassure the American public that he is out there looking at these problems and trying to solve them and not focusing on the sins of the past , " he said .
Besides , he added , " When push comes to shove , we are the legislative branch of government .
We have oversight responsibilities .
And we do n't need the executive branch 's approval to look into these things just as a constitutional matter . "
" We have this American government , which has an architecture and a shape and a system that drives it and constrains it and that keeps it honest , " he continued .
" And what happened is that the Bush administration figured out a lot of ways to tunnel through the walls and sneak over the fences .
So now we need to go back and say , ' We have got to plant those walls deeper so you can not tunnel under them . '
We 've got to spotlight how they did it ...
The ultimate goal in this is to protect and enhance American democracy . "
Members of the Bush Administration have n't been as resistant to the concept of a truth commission than they might have been at first glance .
 My view has always been to be as cooperative as possible ,  former Bush Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told the Washington Independent , an alternative news site .
 And that s what Ive been with respect to everything .
As far as I m concerned Ive got nothing to hide and Ill cooperate .
Every time Ive been asked to cooperate , Ive cooperated .
In terms of what happens in the future , I m not going to comment on that , but that is what Ive done in the past . 
Robert Luskin , the lawyer for former Bush advisor Karl Rove , told Raw Story he had " no comment " on Leahy 's truth commission proposal earlier this month .
Obama 's CIA director , Leon Panetta , announced to a Senate hearing earlier this month that the Obama administration would not prosecute CIA officers who participated in harsh interrogations that critics say constituted torture .
Asked by The Associated Press if that was official policy , Panetta said , " That is the case . "
Panetta 's statements , however , do n't rule out disciplinary action -- or a hearing -- by the Senate .

Bailout Overseer : Treasury Overpaid By Nearly $ 80 Billion
UPDATED WITH FURTHER COMMENTS FROM BAILOUT OVERSEER :
Harvard econ Prof. Elizabeth Warren , testifying before a Senate Banking committee hearing underway now to judge the performance of the $ 700 billion bailout , said that the Treasury overpaid by $ 78 billion in its first round of investments into troubled banks .
Warren said that Treasury spent $ 254 billion to purchase assets whose actual value was only $ 176 billion , " a shortfall of about $ 78 billion , " she said .
Warren said Treasury failed to " price for risk , " and used a metaphor to explain :
It 's as if Treasury was looking at 10 paintings and promised to pay $ 1 million for each , even though " one is a Picasso , one is a Rembrandt " and the other eight are not .
" There may be good policy reasons for overpaying , " Warren said , " but without clearly delineated reasons , we can't know that . "
Warren said her group hired financial advisory firm Duff & Phelps , " which we got at half - price , " she said , and leaned on other professors and experts to determine the value of the assets the government bought .
" They all hammered until they were confident " with their number , Warren said .
They concluded that the government overpayment so far estimated recently by the Congressional Budget Office -- $ 64 billion -- was " understated . "
Sen. Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) , ranking member on the committee , cited the CBO numbers to point out that the government bailouts to the auto industry has a subsidy rate of 63 percent , meaning that for every three dollars taxpayers gave the Big Three , they can expect to get only one dollar back .
Warner : Government Could See First Bailout Dividends
This Month
10:46 A.M. : Sen. Mark Warner ( D - Va. ) , said that troubled banks could begin paying back of the money they 've been given this month in the form of dividends .
Former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke sold the bailout plan to lawmakers by telling them that , if the bailout works right , taxpayers could actually make money on the deal .
Sen . Evan Bayh ( D - Ind. ) said Congress will approve no more federal bailout money without " airtight assurances " that the bailout will be better managed .
" We may have stabilized the financial markets , but at the cost of losing the public 's confidence , " Bayh said .
He said the program needs three things : " Accountability , accountability , accountability . "
Gene Dodaro , acting U.S. Comptroller General , said , " Communication has been plaguing the program from the outset . "

The Ticker is Twittering !
my $ name1 = '' ; my $ name2 = '' ; my $ address1 = '' ; my $ address2 = '' ; ...
Novice programmers often seem to think that their biggest problem is learning the syntax of the language .
Throw in the standard libraries , if you like .
They 're wrong , but that 's okay -- they 're novices .
Their biggest problem is learning how to manage complexity .
I 've seen far too few tutorials teach this from the start .
I believe that Perl 5 offers several excellent ways to manage complexity , and a handful of awful ways to allow complexity to spiral out of control .
I also believe that a well - taught student will develop habits to prevent unnecessary complexity from creeping into a system .
Let me be more concrete .
Many novice programs I 've read have big blocks of variable declarations at the top :
While that 's technically a valid program ( the computer does n't care ) , it 's probably not a well - abstracted or well - encapsulated program , and it 's likely ignoring modern Perl idioms .
One of the greatest advantages of lexical scoping with enforced variable declarations -- an advantage Perl has over Ruby and Python , for example -- is that you can see the scope of a variable by looking for its declaration .
If you keep your scopes small -- if you encapsulate behavior into discrete pieces -- you reduce the possibility that essential information will leak out of those scopes into surrounding code .
You minimize the coupling between distinct units of behavior .
Try explaining that to a novice .
To my mind , the greatest discovery in programming is the procedure .
Attaching a name to a discrete unit of behavior lets you break down a big problem into smaller problems .
Lisp and Forth hackers talk about this all the time .
So do functional programmers .
It 's true .
Try explaining that to a novice , too .
If we really believed that maintainability is the primary concern of code , and efficiency and reuse and optimization were second - order concerns , we 'd explain subroutines as " a way to attach a name to a discrete unit of behavior " instead of " common code you call more than once . "
They 're both largely true definitions , but explaining the former first confers a huge advantage in my mind .
Get novices in the habit of breaking problems down into separate , named steps and perhaps they 'll write better code .

9. Cubic Houses ( Rotterdam , Netherlands )
The original idea of these cubic houses came about in the 1970s .
Piet Blom has developed a couple of these cubic houses that were built in Helmond .
The city of Rotterdam asked him to design housing on top of a pedestrian bridge and he decided to use the cubic houses idea .
The concept behind these houses is that he tries to create a forest by each cube representing an abstract tree ; therefore the whole village becomes a forest .

The recession is not driving music lovers to piracy .
Just away from their CD players .
The volume of legal music downloaded in Q3 increased 29 % over the same period a year ago .
That beats the growth in illegal music downloads over peer - to - peer networks , which rose 23 % y/y .
Overall demand for music declined 2 % in the third quarter , research group NPD reports .
More of their numbers :
Fifteen percent of Internet users purchased music from online music stores , such as iTunes and AmazonMP3 , which is an increase of 2 percentage points over last year and equates to approximately 2.8 million additional music - download customers .
The volume of CDs purchased declined by 19 percent in Q3 compared to last year .
Year - over - year consumer demand for music among Internet users in the U.S. fell 2 percent in the third quarter ( Q3 ) of 2008 .
CD sales volume were among teens ( down 34 percent ) and among adults age 26 to 35 ( down 36 percent ) .
CD purchases by adults age 36 and older showed a more moderate decline of 10 percent .

In these days of high definition videos everywhere ( even YouTube ) , only the truly geeky would decide to watch their movies in ASCII text in a terminal window .
The surprising thing is that some videos are even fairly watchable .
I ’ve found that cartoons work best because of the limited detail .
Even more importantly , the series finale and ( probably ) last ever Futurama movie is coming out Tomorrow on DVD !
You can pre-order Futurama : Into the Wild Green Yonder on Amazon .
Watch Movies in ASCII
The first thing you ’ll want to do is make sure that mplayer is installed , which is easy enough from the command line :
sudo apt - get install mplayer
Then , to actually watch the movies from a terminal window , use the following syntax , replacing MovieName with the filename of your video .
mplayer - vo caca MovieName.avi
The “ caca ” command is actually the color text driver – you could also use ” - vo aa ” instead for black & white , but that would just be silly .
These screenshots do n’t really do it justice – it ’s seriously just as bad when you ’re watching .
Sequences with a lot of contrast work better …
And it would n’t help to sit about 8 feet back from the monitor .
Now that was truly a Stupid Geek Trick !
A giant $ 42 billion stimulus package has passed the Senate following a week of drawn - out negotiations between the Government and crossbenchers .
Independent senator Nick Xenophon was the last crossbencher to agree to terms with the Government .
After talks with Treasurer Wayne Swan overnight and Friday morning , Senator Xenophon announced he was ready to vote for the package .

But then , how could we please everyone ?
With more than 4,700 games in the App Store for Apple 's iPhone and iPod Touch music players , completing a thorough review of the library 's offerings would be impossible .
Luckily , plenty of you are playing games on the gadgets .
Apple has sold more than 20 million iPhones , plus countless more iPod Touches , and market - research firm comScore reports that 32.4 percent of iPhone users say they have downloaded a game in the last month , compared to an average across all mobile devices of 3.8 percent .
Hoping to tap the wisdom of the crowd , we asked you to vote for your favorites .
Here , after more intensive play - test sessions , are Wired.com readers ' top-rated iPhone game picks , plus our take on each one .
10 . JellyCar ( Free )
You said : " You guide your car through various courses trying to complete in the best time .
The game uses ' Jelly Physics , ' where your car bends , stretches and even breaks .
It seems silly at first but after a few minutes , you 're hooked ! "
Our take : Based on the Xbox Community Game of the same name , JellyCar has clever crayonlike graphics and a unique gameplay gimmick where your gelatin - based vehicle rolls and smooshes its way toward the goal .
Figuring out the physics can be challenging , and playing with the iPhone can be a bit of a pain .
You have to press the left and right areas of the screen to get the car accelerating , then tilt the iPhone to add rotation to the vehicle .
A few minutes of this and it 's carpal tunnel time .
9. WordWarp__ ( $ 1) __
You said : " Take six given letters and make as many words as possible in the time limit . "
Our take :
Do you enjoy playing Jumble in the daily paper ?
Just like the well - known pen-and - paper puzzle , WordWarp gives you a scrambled six - letter word .
You 're tasked with unscrambling it , but also with coming up with as many smaller words as can be made from its letters in a two - minute time window .
The " warp " feature lets you randomize the letters , which helps when forming words .
Unfortunately ( and aggravatingly ) , the word list is n't complete – we found a lot of words it did n't accept .
8. Cube Runner ( Free )
You said : " Free and highly addictive . "
Our take : Looking very much like an early prototype of Star Fox , Cube Runner is a very simple exercise in not screwing up .
Pilot your ship by tilting the iPhone left and right .
Do n't hit any of the cubes .
For each second you stay alive , you get points ; crash and it 's game over .
No checkpoints , no goal other than a high score .
Cube Runner makes great use of subtle and responsive tilt controls , but it 's less a test of your gamer aptitude than an exercise in seeing how long you can be exposed to the same repeating stimulus until you inevitably get distracted and crash .
7. Tap Defense ( Free )
You said : " Set up turrets , then let the demons attack .
It 's great for playing in short bursts . "
__Our take : __You 're lucky we even let this one on the list , considering we covered its genre to death with Crystal Defenders and Field Runners in our previous Top 10 .
Tap Defense is nearly identical to those games – waves of enemies approach your position , and you have to set up increasingly powerful sets of weaponized defense towers to hold them off .
Once you buy and place your towers and the enemies flood in , there 's nothing you can do except wait to see if your automatic defense system works .
6. Topple ( Free )
You said : " Fun , casual stacking game from the folks that made Rolando .
Bought Rolando but seem to end up playing this free game more .
It 's fast and fun and makes great use of the iPhone interface . "
Our take : Blocks fall from the sky .
But instead of just rotating them by 90 - degree increments and placing them in neat piles , you have to drag and rotate them with your fingers , then gently build a stack that does n't fall over .
At first it 's easy , but then you get more - challenging oddly shaped platforms ( above ) and things like eggs that do n't stack perfectly .
It 's charming , addictive , works very well with the iPhone – and you can't beat the price .
5. iShoot ( $3 )
You said : " Seriously ?
How could this not be at the top ? "
__Our take : __Hey , it 's Scorched Earth !
We used to play this in high school on the computers in the library .
This classic DOS game pitted four tanks against each other in turn - based , 2 - D battle .
Each tank takes its turn firing off a round of ammo , which destroys other tanks as well as the environment .
Last tank standing wins , and you can buy more weapons between rounds .
In iShoot , you can aim with the touch screen .
Otherwise , it 's pretty much identical to the classic , down to the taunting battle cries from your opponents .
4. Trism ( $3 )
You said : " Bejeweled - like but better , with tilt controls and more complex movement / combo possibilities .
Very addictive .
You can save games too ( they can last quite a while ) .
I would pick Trism over Bejeweled every time . "
Our take : I 'll agree with this – Trism is much more complex than Bejeweled .
So much so that it seems to be out of my league .
Matching three like - colored gems by sliding the diagonal rows of pieces is one thing .
But going beyond that initial match to set up combos is n't something my brain can process .
Especially since you can alter the way the blocks fall by reorienting the iPhone so " down " is a different direction .
Clever .
But I just started sliding the rows in all different directions and racked up crazy combos by tilting the iPhone around randomly .
Trism might be great for puzzle nuts , but I would n't call it casual .
3. Wurdle ( $2 )
You said : " Wurdle is similar to the board game Boggle , but even more addictive .
Wurdle is the only game which has the privilege of living on my home screen . "
__Our take : __One of many Boggle clones in the App Store , Wurdle 's gameplay will be immediately apparent to you if you 've ever played the famous word - creation game .
Join up contiguous letters from the randomly generated 5x5 grid to make as many words as you can in 12 minutes .
The word lists are far more complete than WordWrap 's , so it 'll recognize just about anything .
But you wo n't even make a dent in the list of possibilities .
If a 5x5 grid is too much for you , competing game Quordy ( $ 3 ) is almost identical to Wurdle , but with a 4x4 grid instead .
2. Galcon ( $5 )
You said : " So easy , yet so challenging . "
Our take :
This is my favorite of the iPhone games recommended by Wired.com readers .
It 's a lightning - fast game where you and your opponent start out with a planet , and quickly start dragging your ships to nearby planets to take them over .
The number on each planet is the number of your ships it 'll take to conquer it .
Each time you take over a planet , it starts generating more ships depending on how large it is .
So the optimal strategy is to drag your ships to large planets with small numbers .
Games take a minute or two at most – you do n't have time to plan a huge strategy , just to think on your feet .
1. * Lux Touch * ( Free , deluxe version is $ 8 )
__You said : " __A casual , Risk - like game that is thoroughly addictive .
Ca n't save , but hey , it 's free .
And you can finish most games in 10 to 15 minutes . "
Our take : Similar to Galcon , * Lux World * is about taking over territory and building your armies in a short span of time .
But this game is turn - based instead of real - time , and hard instead of easy .
In each turn , you can attack neighboring territories , place more armies on the map and shuffle their positions around .
But it takes a careful balance of offense and defense to secure more land without leaving yourself vulnerable .

In a classic tale of symbiosis , researchers have determined that a parasitic wasp got its most potent weapon from an ancient virus that may have attacked it around 100 million years ago .
When a parasitic wasp wants to lay its eggs in a caterpillar , it takes steps to ensure that everything goes according to plan :
Along with the eggs , it injects a powerful dose of virus - like particles .
Not only do these disable the caterpillars ' immune system to stop it attacking the eggs , they also cause paralysis and keep the host from pupating – turning the caterpillar into an eternally youthful larder and nursery for the wasp grubs [ New Scientist ] .
But the nature of the wasp 's poison has been a subject of debate .
The virulent particles , were named polydnaviruses because they resemble viruses ; they consist of protein - encased , double - stranded DNA pieces .
But their DNA does n't match that of any other known virus , and a closer analysis showed that the particles contained mostly wasp DNA .
That had entomologists wondering if the wasps had come up with the virus - imitating particles themselves .
" The spectre arose that the wasps were doing really clever genetic engineering that looks just like a virus but is really a wasp invention " [ New Scientist ] ,
explains lead researcher James Whitfield .
To clear up the confusion , researchers studied the ovaries of female wasps , where the particles are produced .
In one species of wasps , researchers found that
22 genes matched those of an ancient family of viruses called nudiviruses ....
Further experiments showed that these genes code for key structural proteins in the wasps ' polydnavirus toxins [ ScienceNOW Daily News ] .
As the researchers explain in Science , this implies that the wasps were attacked by a nudivirus millions of years ago , but found a way to turn the situation to their advantage .
The genes that were derived from the nudivirus produce proteins that form the virus coat , as well as those that
package DNA into virus particles .
Viruses usually stuff their own DNA into these capsid shells ....
The wasps , it seems , have hijacked the entire system to shove [ their ] genes into the virus particles [ New Scientist ] .
The wasp 's toxic particles can't really be considered viruses , researchers say , because they 're not independent actors ; over time , the viral DNA had become fully integrated into the wasp genome .
As it currently stands , the wasps need the virus to survive , because the virus helps the insects lay eggs in caterpillars .
The virus also needs the wasp to survive , because the virus can only replicate in the wasp 's ovaries .
The virus cannot replicate inside the caterpillar , because all of its replication machinery is inside the wasp [ ScienceNOW Daily News ] .
Sounds like everyone 's getting something good out of the arrangement -- except the caterpillars .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - Tom Cruise , who fails to assassinate Adolf Hitler in his new movie “ Valkyrie , ” said he grew up really wanting to kill the Nazi leader .
Tom Cruise arrives for the premiere of the film " Valkyrie " in New York December 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
In the World War Two thriller based on a true story of the unsuccessful attempt by German soldiers to kill Hitler , Cruise plays Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg who plants a briefcase bomb under a table at Hitler ’s military headquarters .
A heavy wooden table saves Hitler and Stauffenberg is executed with his co-conspirators .
“ I always wanted to kill Hitler , I hated him , ” the Hollywood star of such major blockbusters as “ Top Gun ” and “ Mission Impossible , ” told the press during a visit to Seoul to promote his latest film .
“ As a child studying history and looking at documents , I wondered , why did n’t someone stand up and try to stop it ?
When I read the script , it was entertaining and informative to know what the challenges were and what it was like to be in the environment . ”
Stauffenberg ’s legacy helped ease the burden of guilt about World War Two and the Holocaust Germans still endure .
But Germans had balked at the prospect of Cruise playing Stauffenberg as they objected to the actor ’s ties to Scientology , the movement founded in the 1950s by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard .
Germany , which does not recognize Scientology as a religion and regards it as a cult , made it difficult for the crew to film in the Bendlerblock building and courtyard where Stauffenberg was shot dead .
“ I ’ve never heard of this story before ...
It turned out to be an incredible adventure , just to be there and shoot at these locations that Stauffenberg was .
It was a very powerful experience and hopefully it will communicate with the audience , ” the actor said .
“ It has certainly influenced my life , just knowing that there were people who tried to stop him ( Hitler ) . ”
Valkyrie , directed by Bryan Singer , opened in the United States on December 25 and fared better than skeptics had predicted , reaching No. 4 in the North American box office ratings for the three - day weekend starting December 26 .
It opens on January 22 in Seoul for the first time in Asia .
Opponents of the mass fluoridation of water will next week try to stop a government drive to add the chemical to supplies used by millions of people in England and Wales .
The verdict on a small scheme covering 200,000 people in Southampton and southwest Hampshire will help shape public attitudes to far bigger proposals countrywide , and the South Central Strategic Health Authority 's decision could potentially make ministers rethink plans to implement fluoridation .
Authorities in northwest England are among those next in line to bring forward proposals .
Attempts to increase fluoridation stalled for more than a generation after local councils lost control over public health in 1974 and water supplies were privatised , but a law change at the end of 2003 allowed health authorities to order , rather than ask , water companies to add fluoride .
So far about 5.5 million people , a ninth of the population in England , live in areas with added fluoride and another 500,000 with equivalent levels where the chemical occurs naturally .
The Scottish government decided against letting local authorities decide on adding the chemical more than four years ago .
The Isle of Man dropped the idea last summer .
Supporters say added fluoride cuts tooth decay and reduces health inequalities between rich and poor areas , with the benefit spreading to adults as well as children .
They say it could save infants with poor first teeth facing traumatic operations to remove them at a cost to the NHS of £ 500 a time .
Fluoridation has long been used in the US and England 's West Midlands and has shown no evidence of being harmful .
Opponents object to what they see as mass medication , pointing to potential risks including lower IQ in children , bone cancer and hip fractures in the old .
Adding fluoride to toothpaste has raised levels in people 's bodies , they say , and evidence for water treatment cutting decay is not clear - cut .
Southampton primary care trust has prompted the latest argument over fluoride , forcing a consultation .
Hampshire county council opposes the idea .
Southampton city council supports it .
Barry Cockcroft , chief dental officer for England , said fluoridation " is the perfect public health measure because people with the greatest need benefit most and most people benefit to some degree " .
Defeat in Southampton " would be disappointing " , but would not stop other authorities investigating the idea .
Mike Lennon , chairman of the British Fluoridation Society and professor of public health at Sheffield University , was less sure .
A number were " sitting back and waiting to see what happens in [ Hampshire ] .
If it is successful , I suspect they will go ahead .
If it is not successful , then I suspect Barry Cockcroft and others will have to go back to the drawing board . "
Fluoridation was a " mass measure " , not mass medication , Lennon insisted .
" In Hartlepool , where there is fluoride naturally present , you do n't call it a medicated water supply , " he said .
Breakfast cereals had added vitamins , he went on .
" You call them supplemented or fortified . "
Stephen Peckham , reader in health policy at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , and a member of Hampshire Against Fluoride , said : " There is good evidence to demonstrate that , at a minimum , water fluoridation will lead to increased levels of dental fluorosis [ staining ] of a moderate or severe nature .
In addition , evidence suggests that further health problems are likely to occur due to overexposure to fluoride ...
There has been no discussion of the complex ethical issues that water fluoridation entails . "
The National Pure Water Association said that fluoridation was " an outdated concept " .
The case for flouride
• On average children aged 5 - 14 who drink fluoridated water have 2.2 fewer teeth affected by decay than children in non-fluoridated areas
• In fluoridated areas there are 15 % more children who are " decay - free "
• Evidence suggests it benefits adults too
• Severe tooth decay can lead to a loss of confidence and social isolation
• It is a public good - the greatest benefit is to those least able to help themselves
... and against
• The beneficial effects are unproven , as most supporting evidence is of insufficient quality
• Potential harm to public health
• Increase of fluorosis ( staining ) of teeth
• Restricts individual choice and removes right of consent to " medical " treatment
• Less " coercive " interventions , such as teeth - brushing programmes and applying fluoride to the surface of teeth , are better
The Lindsey Oil Refinery foreign labour row spread across the UK Police are preparing to face a " summer of rage " in the UK as people join protests over the economic downturn , says a senior Met Police officer .
" Known activists " were likely to foment unrest , with the recession creating more " footsoldiers " to join them , Supt David Hartshorn told the Guardian .
The G20 meeting in London in April is expected to be a focus of protests .
BBC home editor Mark Easton said signs of anger would " not necessarily translate into action on the streets " .
Supt Hartshorn is regularly briefed on potential civil unrest , as head of Scotland Yard 's public order branch .
The officer said that the established activists " would be good at motivating people , but they have n't had the ' footsoldiers ' to actually carry out [ protests ] .
" Obviously the downturn in the economy , unemployment , repossessions , changes that .
Suddenly there is the opportunity for people to mass protest . "
The upcoming meeting of the G20 in London in April has been selected by some activists as a focus for anger
Mark Easton
BBC home editor
Read Mark 's thoughts in full
He added : " We 've got G20 coming and I think that is being advertised on some of the sites as the highlight of what they see as a ' summer of rage ' . "
The G20 meeting will bring together leading industrial powers and emerging market nations .
Supt Hartshorn also said that banks , particularly those that paid large bonuses despite receiving billions of pounds of taxpayers ' money , had become " viable targets " for protesters .
But our home editor said " activity on websites does not necessarily translate into action on the streets " .
" With the entire economy at grave risk , it is unclear whether anger at the failures of banks , other financial institutions and governments will translate into support for action designed to topple those same bodies . "
He added : " That police have identified attempts to exploit the current economic downturn is not a surprise and they will undoubtedly be arguing for greater resources to counter a potential threat to public order . "
The year has already seen wildcat strikes across the UK in sympathy with British workers protesting at the use of foreign labour at Lindsey Oil Refinery in Lincolnshire .
On Saturday , about 100,000 joined a march in Dublin to protest about the Irish government 's handling of the country 's recession .
Greece , France and Iceland have also seen protests over the economic crisis .

Such findings would further the debate over whether homosexuality is innate or a choice
Compared to straight men , gay men are more likely to be left - handed , to be the younger siblings of older brothers , and to have hair that whorls in a counterclockwise direction .
US researchers are finding common biological traits among gay men , feeding a growing consensus that sexual orientation is an inborn combination of genetic and environmental factors that largely decide a person 's sexual attractions before they are born .
Such findings - including a highly anticipated study this winter - would further inform the debate over whether homosexuality is innate or a choice , an undercurrent of California 's recent Proposition 8 campaign in which television commercials warned that " schools would begin teaching second - graders that boys could marry boys " , suggesting homosexuality would then spread .
Some scientists say the political and moral debate over same - sex marriage frequently strayed from established scientific evidence , including comments by Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin that homosexuality is " a choice " and " a decision " .
Until 2007 , CNN polls had found that a majority of Americans believed gay people could change their sexual orientation if they chose to ; it was only last year that a majority for the first time said homosexuality was an inborn trait .
Christian groups such as Exodus International argue " that homosexuals who desire to change can do so " .
One prominent psychiatrist , Dr Robert Spitzer of Columbia University , found controversial evidence that therapy can cause some gay people to change to a heterosexual orientation , although the study concluded that a " complete change " was uncommon .
While sexual behaviour may be chosen , the preponderance of researchers say attraction is dictated by biology , with no demonstrated contribution from social factors such as parenting or other factors after birth .
A host of studies since the mid-1990s have found common biological traits between gay men , including left - handedness and the direction of hair whorls .
The likelihood that if one identical twin is gay , the other will be also be gay is much higher than the " concordance " of homosexuality between fraternal twins , indicating that genes play a role in sexual orientation , but are not the entire cause .
" In the past decade , I think the pendulum has swung more toward biological theory and biological causes , " said Richard Lippa , a psychology professor at California State University - Fullerton , who has studied hair patterns and other biological traits in gay men .
Sven Bocklandt , a geneticist at the David Geffen school of medicine at UCLA , is bewildered by the argument that people choose their sexual attraction .
He said that virtually every animal species that has been studied - from sheep to fruit flies - has a small minority of individuals who demonstrate homosexual activity .
" I really believe the reason most humans are straight is the same reason that most crocodiles are straight , and the same reason most whales are straight , " Bocklandt said .
" Nature would not leave something so important for reproduction , for the survival of the species , to coincidence . "
Less understood is the degree to which sexual orientation is determined by genes or environmental factors , such as hormones or immunological factors that may act on a foetus .
What scientists call " the fraternal birth order effect " , the fact that each successive boy born to the same mother has a greater chance of being gay , may be due to an increasing immunological response by a mother 's body to each male foetus in her womb .
Long discredited are theories that parenting - one mid-20th century theory held that boys raised by a domineering mother with a distant father were more likely to be gay - has anything to do with sexual orientation .
Evidence of that , said Michael Bailey , a professor of psychology at Northwestern University in Illinois , comes from studies of genetically male infants born with malformed or ambiguous genitals .
In many such cases , surgeons would construct a vagina , and instruct parents to raise the child as a girl , with no knowledge of his medical history .
As adults , those prenatally male / postnatally female people were virtually all attracted to women , Bailey said .
" If you can't make a male attracted to other males by cutting off his penis , castrating him and rearing him as a girl , then how likely is any social explanation of male homosexuality ? " he said .
Researchers are eagerly awaiting a DNA study of male siblings with at least one gay brother by Bailey and other scientists at Northwestern University due in early 2009 , because it may shed light on the role genetics plays in sexual attraction .
By researching 800 sets of brothers , by far the largest study of its type , the Northwestern study is searching for the specific genes that influence some brothers to be gay and others to be heterosexual .
Women may have more fluidity of sexual expression than men , but that does n't mean they do n't have a specific sexual orientation , said Lisa Diamond , a professor of psychology and gender studies at the University of Utah who studies female sexual orientation .
One explanation is that women 's sexual behaviour is driven more by relationships .
For some women , " your sexual orientation does not provide the last word on the sorts of behaviours and identities you might experience in your lifetime , " Diamond said .
" Some lesbian women are predominantly attracted to women , but some of them have found themselves becoming incredibly close to their best male friends , sometimes having sex with them .
It does not make them straight .
It 's not , since you had a one - night stand with your male friend , that you can choose to become straight . "

Hundreds of UK workers face an uncertain future after Wagon Automotive , the Midlands - based car parts maker , said today it will file for administration .
Wagon admitted that attempts to agree a last - ditch refinancing package had broken down .
It will now be run by administrators from Zolfo Cooper who will try to find a buyer for the business .
The rescue talks collapsed because Wagon 's lenders , understood to include Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB , refused to support a € 50 m ( £ 43 m ) rescue package that would have kept Wagon operating .
Both banks have received billions of pounds of support from the UK government .
Wagon 's lenders had loaned it € 155 m earlier this year .
Wagon employs 500 people in the UK .
Its factories in Coventry and Walsall make a range of vehicle accessories including door panels , cabins for trucks , hinges and seats .
It employs another 4,500 elsewhere in Europe , and hopes that some of its overseas operations can keep running without the need for insolvency protection .
Wagon has suffered from the slowdown in the auto industry , where sales have fallen to their lowest levels in decades .
Its shares were suspended in October when it issued a profits warning .
It is mostly owned by American billionaire Wilbur Ross , who was prepared to inject € 10 m of his own money into the rescue package .
Wagon 's customers were also reportedly prepared to contribute € 30 m to keep it on the road .
In case you did n’t know , this coming Sunday at 8 P.M. are the Oscars .
I know many people do n’t like the show .
I often hear to it referred as a big Hollywood circle jerk .
I do n’t really agree with that sentiment as it ’s just an Awards show .
And to be fair , just about anything I ’ve ever been involved in has given out awards .
My middle school gave out awards for academics , the junior varsity field hockey team at my high school gave out MVP awards , and even in business there are awards for excellence in just about anything .
The Oscars are no different , except that the ceremony is on national television .
So I ca n’t fault them for doing what everyone else does .
Nor can I fault them that enough people want to watch that it gets on network television .
And here ’s the great thing , if you do n’t care you are n’t forced to watch .
Still , maybe you ’re going to watch anyway .
Maybe you want to or maybe someone ’s forcing you to watch .
Either way , you can make the night a little more interesting by entering an Oscar Pool and predicting the winners .
It will give you a rooting interest and possibly make a few bucks .
And you can always DVR the show to fast forward through the boring parts and get to the winners .
Now you might think to yourself , I do n’t know that much about these movies and I have n’t seen ( or maybe even heard of ) most of them .
That ’s okay .
The good news is that the Oscars are like an open book test .
With so many precursor award shows , you generally know what ’s popular and who people will vote for .
After all , the Oscars is a popularity contest , most votes win .
If you take the time to look at the various guild and critics awards , you should have a pretty good idea of who will win .
Maybe not every category , but enough to give you a fighting chance .
Armed with that knowledge , you can make a few easy bucks if things break right on Oscar night .
But I ’ll go one step further and do some of the work for you .
Below is a summary of who I ’m going to pick on Oscar night and why .
You can follow my lead , or simply find one or two categories where I ’ll be wrong and do even better than my selections .
Hopefully , come Monday morning these picks will look pretty smart .
THE MAJORS
The awards everyone talks about and people remember years down the road .
Writing is usually included in the major categories , bringing the total major awards to eight .
Best Picture
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Kathleen Kennedy , Frank Marshall and Ceán Chaffin
• Frost / Nixon , Brian Grazer , Ron Howard and Eric Fellner
• Milk , Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen
• The Reader , Anthony Minghella , Sydney Pollack , Donna Gigliotti , and Redmond Morris
• Slumdog Millionaire , Christian Colson
Favorite : Slumdog Millionaire
Slumdog Millionaire has swept most of the secondary awards ( including all three awards associated with Oscar success : the Directors Guild Award , the Golden Globe , and the BAFTA ) and seems to have unstoppable and ever growing momentum .
The only other film still in its rear view mirror is Benjamin Button .
Everything else has been left way behind .
Sometimes people over think these things are look for reasons not to pick the favorite .
This is not one of those times .
Pick : Slumdog Millionaire
Best Director
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , David Fincher
• Frost / Nixon , Ron Howard
• Milk , Gus Van Sant
• The Reader , Stephen Daldry
• Slumdog Millionaire , Danny Boyle
Favorite : Danny Boyle
Boyle captured the Directors Guild award , which predicts the Oscar winner 85 - 90 % of the time .
It ’s the most accurate guild predictor , and given Slumdog ’s likely success elsewhere , this seems like it ’s in the bag .
Pick : Danny Boyle
Best Actor
• Richard Jenkins in The Visitor
• Frank Langella in Frost / Nixon
• Sean Penn in Milk
• Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
• Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler
Favorite : Sean Penn or Mickey Rourke ( varies )
This is a two horse race between Mickey Rourke and Sean Penn .
And it ’s a pretty close one .
Penn captured the SAG Award , which is voted upon by actors .
And actors make up the largest section of the Academy .
But Rourke took the Golden Globe and the BAFTA .
Plus Rourke has an additional advantage , Penn won the Best Actor Oscar fairly recently so there may be some reluctance to award him again .
And the Academy always likes a comeback story .
If Rourke has an undoing , he may alienate voters due to his bad boy reputation and the fact his film seems to turn off a section of Academy voters .
Pick : Mickey Rourke
Best Supporting Actor
• Josh Brolin in Milk
• Robert Downey Jr. in Tropic Thunder
• Philip Seymour Hoffman in Doubt
• Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight
• Michael Shannon in Revolutionary Road
Favorite : Heath Ledger
Pretty much the lock of the night .
A great performance by Ledger combined with his untimely death lead to about zero chance of an upset .
And for good measure , Ledger has won every major award preceding this one , and would become only the second actor to win a posthumous Academy Award ;
Pick : Heath Ledger
Best Actress
• Anne Hathaway in Rachel Getting Married
• Angelina Jolie in Changeling
• Melissa Leo in Frozen River
• Meryl Streep in Doubt
• Kate Winslet in The Reader
Favorite : Kate Winslet
Another tight race , much like Best Actor , where Winslet remains a slight favorite over Meryl Streep .
Normally Streep would be a strong front - runner after capturing the SAG Award and the Critics ’ Choice .
The one caveat is that Winslet won those same awards , but in the Best Supporting Actress category .
Now they square off head to head .
A few interesting tidbits to the race .
The one major award Streep did not win was the Golden Globe , which went to Winslet , but for her role in Revolutionary Road ( Winslet also captured a Golden Globe for Best Supporting actress in The Reader ) .
Streep , maybe the best actress alive , has n’t won anything since 1982 .
Winslet has now been nominated six times without a win to her record .
She ’s due and she ’s had a big year overall .
Pick : Kate Winslet
Best Supporting Actress
• Amy Adams in Doubt
• Penélope Cruz in Vicky Cristina Barcelona
• Viola Davis in Doubt
• Taraji P. Henson in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
• Marisa Tomei in The Wrestler
Favorite : Penélope Cruz
The most interesting race of the night , and a truly wide open one at that .
That can largely be attributed to Kate Winslet , who won nearly all the precursor awards for The Reader and then vacated the category .
Penélope Cruz seems to have emerged from the pack as the favorite , followed by Viola Davis and Marisa Tomei .
Still , this is a notoriously difficult category to predict .
And while I ’d love to see Cruz win , I just do n’t feel safe picking her in a comedy that was n’t nominated for any other awards .
I ’m more inclined to turn towards Doubt , a movie that made an impact with voters , scoring a rare four acting nominations .
And yet I ’m not picking Streep or Hoffman to win , so this is my last chance for Doubt to pick - up a win .
I ’d going with Adams , partly because she has the largest role in this category and because she ’s a bigger name then her Doubt co-star .
I would n’t advise following me on this limb , but I ’m taking the longshot .
Pick : Amy Adams
Adapted Screenplay
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Screenplay by Eric Roth , Screen story by Eric Roth and Robin Swicord
• Doubt , Screenplay by John Patrick Shanley
• Frost / Nixon , Screenplay by Peter Morgan
• The Reader , Screenplay by David Hare
• Slumdog Millionaire , Screenplay by Simon Beaufoy
Favorite : Slumdog Millionaire
Slumdog Millionaire has been cleaning up on the writing awards , winning the Golden Globe , the BAFTA , and the Writer ’s Guild .
It ’s a heavy favorite for the Oscar too .
Pick : Slumdog Millionaire
Original Screenplay
• Frozen River , Screenplay by Courtney Hunt
• Happy - Go-Lucky , Screenplay by Mike Leigh
• In Bruges , Screenplay by Martin McDonagh
• Milk , Screenplay by Dustin Lance Black
• WALL•E , Screenplay by Andrew Stanton , Jim Reardon , Original story by Andrew Stanton , Pete Docter
Favorite : Milk
Milk is the betting favorite , but I ’ve seen both In Bruges and WALL•E considered the frontrunner at some point .
WALL•E is a unique choice given the lack of dialogue in the movie , and could become the first animated movie to collect a writer ’s award .
In Bruges took the BAFTA over Milk , but Milk took the Writer ’s Guild Award .
I ’d side with the WGA in that battle .
Pick : Milk
THE TECHNICAL AWARDS
Not technical in the strictest sense ( as there are Scientific and Technical Achievement Awards too ) , but these reward the those aspects that contribute to the final film .
There are ten in total .
Art Direction
• Changeling , Art Direction : James J. Murakami , Set Decoration : Gary Fettis
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Art Direction : Donald Graham Burt , Set Decoration : Victor J. Zolfo
• The Dark Knight , Art Direction : Nathan Crowley , Set Decoration : Peter Lando
• The Duchess , Art Direction : Michael Carlin , Set Decoration : Rebecca Alleway
• Revolutionary Road , Art Direction : Kristi Zea , Set Decoration : Debra Schutt
Favorite : The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
Art Direction is the building of sets , basically everything you see on screen that is n’t naturally occurring .
Benjamin Button and The Dark Knight are the only two getting any kind of buzz , and Benjamin Button is a Best Picture nominee , which is usually a good tiebreaker for close races .
It also won the Art Director ’s Guild for contemporary film design .
Pick : The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
Cinematography
• Changeling , Tom Stern
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Claudio Miranda
• The Dark Knight , Wally Pfister
• The Reader , Chris Menges and Roger Deakins
• Slumdog Millionaire , Anthony Dod Mantle
Favorite : Slumdog Millionaire
Cinematography is the picture you see on screen , the art of movie photography if you will .
This award tends to go to a beautiful film , one that looks good on screen .
Not all source material lends itself to such photography , but a few Best Picture nominess are included .
Slumdog Millionaire and Benjamin Button are the two frontrunners , but the former took the American Society of Cinematographers award , so it will likely win here .
Pick : Slumdog Millionaire
Costume Design
• Australia , Catherine Martin
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Jacqueline West
• The Duchess , Michael O’Connor
• Milk , Danny Glicker
• Revolutionary Road , Albert Wolsky
Favorite : The Duchess
The Academy is always a sucker for period piece dramas in the costume design category .
Marie Antoinette won two years ago and Elizabeth : The Golden Age won last year .
Neither received great reviews , and people often picked against them figuring the Academy would reward a better reviewed film ( even though that has nothing to do with Costume Design ) .
Those people were wrong .
Pick : The Duchess
Editing
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall
• The Dark Knight , Lee Smith
• Frost / Nixon , Mike Hill and Dan Hanley
• Milk , Elliot Graham
• Slumdog Millionaire , Chris Dickens
Favorite : Slumdog Millionaire
Editing tends to be linked with Best Picture , and with Slumdog Millionaire the favorite there , it remains the favorite here .
It also captured the American Cinema Editors award .
Pick : Slumdog Millionaire
Makeup
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Greg Cannom
• The Dark Knight , John Caglione , Jr. and Conor O’Sullivan
• Hellboy II : The Golden Army , Mike Elizalde and Thom Floutz
Favorite : The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
There are usually two ways to win a best makeup Oscar .
Show people aging or show people deformed .
Pure fantasy tales have become more mainstream in the last decade , so creating fantasy characters is quickly becoming a third option .
All three possibilities are represented here .
Benjamin Button should prevail by hitting on an old Oscar favorite and showing characters aging in both directions .
Pick : The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
Original Score
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Alexandre Desplat
• Defiance , James Newton Howard
• Milk , Danny Elfman
• Slumdog Millionaire , A.R. Rahman
• WALL•E , Thomas Newman
Favorite : Slumdog Millionaire
The Dark Knight caused a stir here , originally having its score disqualified , then later reinstated .
It did n’t even merit a nomination in the end , so much ado about nothing .
That leaves the usual suspects plus Defiance , a true sleeper .
Still , nothing appears to pill enough support to unseat Slumdog in this category .
Pick : Slumdog Millionaire
Original Song
• “ Down to Earth ” from WALL•E , Music by Peter Gabriel and Thomas Newman , Lyric by Peter Gabriel
• “ Jai Ho ” from Slumdog Millionaire , Music by A.R. Rahman , Lyric by Gulzar
• “ O Saya ” from Slumdog Millionaire , Music and Lyric by A.R. Rahman and Maya Arulpragasam
Favorite : Jai Ho
Original Song has been fairly unpredictable in recent years , as even Eminem and Three 6 Mafia won Oscars ( and before Martin Scorsese ) .
This from an Academy that ’s been historically viewed as too old .
Who would have thought Academy would reward rap music ?
And twice ?
Down to three choices this year , blind odds say I can pick the winner 33 % of the time .
Despite the favored status of Slumdog , I ’ll go with a split vote between its nominees and an upset from Peter Gabriel .
Pick : “ Down to Earth ” from WALL•E
Sound Editing
• The Dark Knight , Richard King
• Iron Man , Frank Eulner and Christopher Boyes
• Slumdog Millionaire , Tom Sayers
• WALL•E , Ben Burtt and Matthew Wood
• Wanted , Wylie Stateman
Favorite : The Dark Knight
For those wondering , sound editing involves the creation of sound .
Those predicting a Slumdog Millionaire sweep figure the movie can snatch up this category in the wave of a big night .
That ’s not impossible , as the film rates as the favorite in most of its nominated categories .
This is not one of them .
And even Best Picture winners rarely sweep all the categories they ’re nominated in .
Historically , this categorey goes to Summer blockbusters , and The Dark Knight and WALL•E are the latest potentials .
I ’m giving the edge to the Batman .
Pick : The Dark Knight
Sound Mixing
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , David Parker , Michael Semanick , Ren Klyce and Mark Weingarten
• The Dark Knight , Lora Hirschberg , Gary Rizzo and Ed Novick
• Slumdog Millionaire , Ian Tapp , Richard Pryke and Resul Pookutty
• WALL•E , Tom Myers , Michael Semanick and Ben Burtt
• Wanted , Chris Jenkins , Frank A. Montaño and Petr Forejt
Favorite : The Dark Knight
Sound Mixing is exactly what is says , the mixing the sound into the film including effects , music , and dialogue .
Again , you ’re presented with the option of whether Slumdog Millionaire can sweep or just win some of the bigger categories .
If it can pick up an early victory in either Sound categorey , you know it will be a big , big night for the film .
Slumdog also won the Cinema Audio Society award , but I ’m not ready to climb on board for a victory here .
Pick : The Dark Knight
Visual Effects
• The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Eric Barba , Steve Preeg , Burt Dalton and Craig Barron
• The Dark Knight , Nick Davis , Chris Corbould , Tim Webber and Paul Franklin
• Iron Man , John Nelson , Ben Snow , Dan Sudick and Shane Mahan
Favorite : The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
Usually this category is reserved for the Summer blockbusters , although Lord of the Rings and Titanic both won here en route to huge Oscar nights .
The Dark Knight had solid effects , but nothing outstanding .
Iron Man had what Transformers had last year , and Transformers lost ( although some blame Michael Bay for that ) .
So I ’m sticking with Benjamin Button .
Pick : The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
THE SPECIALIZED AWARDS
These final six awards require a film to be of a certain type and / or length .
They are often the most obscure and hardest to predict .
Best Animated Film
• Bolt , Chris Williams and Byron Howard
• Kung Fu Panda , John Stevenson and Mark Osborne
• WALL•E , Andrew Stanton
Favorite : WALL•E
You know it ’s going to be WALL•E , I know it ’s going to be WALL•E , feel safe picking WALL•E .
Pick : WALL•E
Best Animated Short
• La Maison en Petits Cubes , Kunio Kato
• Lavatory – Lovestory , Konstantin Bronzit
• Oktapodi , Emud Mokhberi and Thierry Marchand
• Presto , Doug Sweetland
• This Way Up , Alan Smith and Adam Foulkes
Favorite : Presto
With any of three short categories , you ’re probably better off just throwing a dart at a board to make the selection .
They are that unpredictable .
Pixar ’s Presto rates as a favorite based on brand name alone , but you can watch them online and pick your favorite .
And it ’s not like Pixar wins this all the time , as they ’ve lost plenty times this decade .
When in doubt , vote for whichever short is longest .
For the last five years , this award has been won by the nominee with the longest runtime .
Pick : La Maison en Petits Cubes
Best Documentary
• The Betrayal ( Nerakhoon ) , Ellen Kuras and Thavisouk Phrasavath
• Encounters at the End of the World , Werner Herzog and Henry Kaiser
• The Garden , Scott Hamilton Kennedy
• Man on Wire , James Marsh and Simon Chinn
• Trouble the Water , Tia Lessin and Carl Deal
Favorite : Man on Wire
Trouble the Water is a remarkable and heartbreaking account of Hurricane Katrina , but Man on a Wire defeated Slumdog Millionare to win Best British film at the BAFTAs .
And it features a man walking between the Towers of the World Trade Center .
That should be enough to carry it to victory .
Pick : Man on Wire
Best Documentary Short
• The Conscience of Nhem En , Steven Okazaki
• The Final Inch , Irene Taylor Brodsky and Tom Grant
• Smile Pinki A Principe Production , Megan Mylan
• The Witness – From the Balcony of Room 306 , Adam Pertofsky and Margaret Hyde
Favorite : The Conscience of Nhem En
At least there are only four nominations here , increasing one ’s blind luck odds from 20 % to 25 % .
I like Witness , a documentary about the shooting of Martin Luther King , Jr.
Pick : The Witness
Best Foreign Film
• The Baader Meinhof Complex , Germany
• The Class , France
• Departures , Japan
• Revanche , Austria
• Waltz with Bashir , Israel
Favorite : Waltz with Bashir
Waltz with Bashir has two things going for it .
It ’s won many of the precusor awards and its from Israel .
I know it ’s a cliché , but the Academy has many Jewish members and I ’m sure they would n’t mind seeing Israel win Best Foreign Film .
The Class also has its supporters .
Pick : Waltz with Bashir
Best Live Action Short
• Auf der Strecke ( On the Line ) , Reto Caffi
• Manon on the Asphalt , Elizabeth Marre and Olivier Pont
• New Boy , Steph Green and Tamara Anghie
• The Pig , Tivi Magnusson and Dorte Høgh
• Spielzeugland ( Toyland ) , Jochen Alexander Freydank
Favorite : Spielzeugland ( Toyland )
I think Spielzeugland rates as a betting favorite due to its subject matter , a German mother who deals with a son close to a Jewish boy during World War 2 .
But in a wide open race , I ’m going to trust The Movie Retriever on their choice .
Pick : Manon on the Asphalt
That ’s all twenty - four Oscars .

BEIJING  Chinese courts sentenced two men to death on Thursday for endangering public safety in a tainted - milk scandal that killed at least six children , according to state - run news media .
Three other defendants , including a top dairy company executive , were sentenced to life in prison .
Another defendant received a suspended death sentence , and 15 others were given prison terms from 2 to 15 years .
The sentences were the first to be handed down in one of the worst food safety scandals in China in decades .
The scandals erupted in September , prompting a global recall of Chinese - made dairy products , shaking consumer confidence and devastating the nation ’s dairy industry .
Some lawyers and victims have accused Beijing of failing to regulate the nation ’s dairy industry properly .
Some critics believe that the government covered up the scandal until after the Olympic Games in Beijing in August .

Exactly how it happens , no one really knows .
But it happens :
A house eventually becomes something more than a home - more than a mass of carefully measured and assembled wood and glass , Sheetrock and steel .
Once it has been lived in for a certain length of time , it begins to exhibit some of the human characteristics of its inhabitants .
For better or worse , it acquires a personality .
Some are welcoming , modest and comfortable .
Others are smug , self - important and pretentious .
A very few - abandoned and with a history as dark as their shuttered parlors - are even reputed to be haunted .
With a past as colorful as its ornate facade , the 120 - year - old Victorian at 908 Steiner St. - which recently came on the market for $ 1.6 million - exudes a surprising mix of refinement and irreverence : like a sophisticated , elderly aunt delivering the punch line to an off - color joke with obvious relish and gusto .
" It 's really one of a kind of a rare gem that comes on the market in San Francisco once every five or 10 years , " says Jamie Howell .
" It 's a good example of pre-earthquake , 19th century San Francisco Victorian , untouched by fire . "
A Realtor with Hill and Co. , which has the listing , Howell - a former road manager for Natalie Cole and Hot Tuna - remembers the house during the ' 70s , when it was known as the " Psychedelic House . "
It acquired the name , along with a certain amount of fame , after its owners painted the exterior with just about every color , and combination of colors , in the spectrum .
The fiberglass model of a 10 - foot Nile alligator was affixed to a space between the upper - story windows .
Bay Area photographer Patrick Goggins captured the image on film , which now graces the front of a very collectible postcard .
After the house was featured in this paper and several national magazines in the late ' 60s , it became something of a tourist attraction .
Visitors from the suburbs would drive past to see the " hippie house . "
Tourists from abroad stopped to gawk at the riot of color on display at Alamo Square .
" Someone accused me of being a hippie , " says Maija Peeples - Bright , who , along with then - husband David Zack , owned the house at the time .
" I thought it was an insult .
I was a bona fide artist . "
Long before its days as the " Rainbow House , " which is what Maija and her husband and friends called the place , it was known as the Iverson House .
Built in 1888 by contractor P.O. Chandler at a cost of $ 4,370 , the first owner and occupant was Niels Iverson .
A Danish immigrant who sailed to California via Cape Horn in 1848 at the age of 18 , Iverson made a living in real estate and a Mendocino lumber business .
Iverson , along with his wife , Kierstan , and six children , lived in the home until 1896 , when the family moved to 1728 Page St .
The house then became the home of James McGiffin , a draper at W. & J. Sloane , and a bachelor who lived with several members of his extended family .
McGiffin 's sister , Maggie , kept the home until 1923 , when barber John Almerico and his wife , Jennie , moved in .
After a succession of owners , the house was bought by the St. Anthony Dining Room in 1956 and used as a shelter for homeless men who worked at the dining room at Golden Gate and Jones streets .
The interior was divided into single rooms with Sheetrock and lit by bare lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling .
Peeples - Bright was born Maija Gergeris in Latvia .
She and her family immigrated to the United States at the end of World War II .
She later enrolled at UC Davis to study mathematics but - entranced by an art class she took to fulfill a general education requirement - decided to become an artist .
In San Francisco , she met Zack through a mutual friend .
When they married in 1965 , her father helped them buy the house on Steiner Street .
" It was kind of a custom in my country for the family to give the young folks a home , " says Maija , " so my father gave me $ 5,000 . "
The house , which sold for $ 17,000 , became a gathering place for Maija 's friends and colleagues - artists associated with the " California Funk Movement " such as Roy De Forest , Manual Neri , David Gilhooly , Robert Arneson and William Wiley .
Graphic artists Robert Crumb and S.K. Wilson were also among the crowd .
An English professor at the San Francisco Art Institute , Zack also worked as an art critic for KQED - TV from 1965 through 1968 .
Following a backlash against the wholesale demolition of Victorians in the Western Addition , the city created a redevelopment zone and offered low - interest loans to residents interested in fixing up their homes .
A representative of the agency suggested that Maija paint her home beige .
" That 's not what I had envisioned , " says Maija .
" I liked color .
I decided to paint it multiple colors . "
A friend who worked in a supply store helped her find marine enamel paint in a multitude of colors .
She had a painting crew erect a scaffold and prime the exterior .
Then she went to work .
Friends pitched in .
Occasionally , passers - by did the same .
" I often found myself with someone climbing up on the scaffold saying , ' What can I do ? ' " recalls Maija .
" I 'd give them a coffee can with some paint in it , a brush and say , ' Paint that window trim blue . ' "
When the exterior was done , Maija moved inside and started painting murals on the ceilings upstairs .
Colorful renditions of cartoon - like figures of herself , her husband and their dog , Woof , along with fantasy creatures Maija calls " Beasties " engaged in various adventures , the murals were titled " Beast Volcano Ceiling , " " Beast Rainbow Ceiling " and " Penguins Barking up an Eel Tree Ceiling . "
Now 66 , Maija lives in Sacramento with her husband , Bill Bright .
She has n't lost her enthusiasm for art , she says , and still works diligently in ceramics , acrylics and oils .
Her work is featured in the permanent collections of a number of local galleries .
When current owners John Michaud and his partner , Douglas Bray , bought the house in 1993 for $ 360,000 , the only work of Maija 's that remained was a mural on one bedroom ceiling , an acrylic floor in an upstairs bathroom and a ceramic plaque on the side of the steps leading to the front door .
There were also some empty Thunderbird wine bottles , left from the home 's days as a men 's shelter .
" Inside it was track lighting , shag carpet and white walls , " says Michaud , a kindergarten teacher at Live Oak School .
" But it was still a Victorian . "
Michaud and Bray have spent 16 years restoring the home .
Longtime Alamo Square resident and local historian Joe Pecora describes 908 Steiner as a flat - roofed , highly ornamented example of the rectilinear Stick - style Victorian townhouse built in San Francisco during the 1880s .
" It has a fairly nice ornate facade that is intact , which is pretty incredible when you consider all that has gone on over there , " says Pecora .
Upon entering the home , there is a walnut front staircase .
On the wall beside it are a pair of buttons once used to summon servants .
A skylight made with colored - glass panes illuminates the area .
There is a hallway , double parlor , dining room and kitchen .
Much of it - including the chandeliers , carpets , drapes , original ceiling medallions , Liberty Bird wallpaper and wainscot moldings - is Victorian style .
Upstairs are four bedrooms , two bathrooms and a small deck that offers a good view of downtown .
Overall , Michaud estimates the house has about 3,000 square feet of living space .
He hopes that whoever ends up buying the house will honor what he believes to be the city 's first " Painted Lady , " a name used to describe Victorian or Edwardian houses painted with three or more colors to highlight the home 's architectural details .
" It 's a piece of San Francisco history , " says Michaud .
" And it has really good bones .
You can do anything with it .
This is not a house for everybody , but for those who love these kind of homes , it 's great . "
Back in 2001 , just months after the anthrax attacks that killed five people , several articles came out in mainstream newspapers that pointed clearly to the CIA and Army as the most likely sources of the weaponized anthrax .
Articles in The Baltimore Sun , Miami Herald , Washington Post and New York Times laid out the facts that incriminated Battelle Memorial Labs in West Jefferson , Ohio , and the Army ’s lab at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah as the only logical sources for the anthrax .
These facts , as reported in 2001 , include :
1 . For over a decade , Army scientists at Dugway have been making weapons - grade anthrax that is “ virtually identical ” to the anthrax used in the attacks .
2 . The anthrax used in the 2001 attacks was extremely concentrated , with a trillion spores per gram .
The Dugway anthrax had a similar concentration .
3 . The FBI was increasingly focused on US government bioweapons research programs as the source of the deadly anthrax .
4 . Both the lab in Utah and the lab in Ohio received anthrax samples from the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) at Fort Detrick , although USAMRIID deals only with wet anthrax and ships it wet .
5 . The investigation was focused on the Dugway anthrax , and Dugway was described as the only facility that was known to be weaponizing anthrax .
6 . One FBI official said that the CIA ’s anthrax was “ the best lead we have at this point . ”
7 . Army officials said that Fort Detrick did not have the equipment for weaponizing anthrax .
The FBI has never explained what became of this initial focus on the labs in Utah and Ohio .
Instead , after the death of Fort Detrick anthrax researcher Bruce Ivins in July 2008 , the FBI attempted to make the case that Ivins was the murderer and all other suspects had been cleared of suspicion .
Since Ivins ’ death , the media have , with very few exceptions , passively swallowed the line dispensed by the FBI , and have acted as little more than stenographers in parroting the hollow arguments presented by the FBI that Ivins is guilty .
On December 12 , 2001 , The Baltimore Sun published a seminal article by Scott Shane that clearly laid out just how strong the evidence was against the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah .
Subtitled “ Organisms made at a military laboratory in Utah are genetically identical to those mailed to members of Congress , ” Shane ’s article also includes this eyebrow - raising line : “ Scientists familiar with the anthrax program at Dugway described it to The Sun on the condition that they not be named . ”
Apparently Shane has forgotten all that he reported seven years ago .
Now with The New York Times , Shane ’s latest piece , published January 4 , 2009 , raises troubling questions about the independence of The Times , and the memory hole that Shane must have used to shunt away all that he once knew about the case the FBI code - named Amerithrax .
Shane calls his 5,200 - word article “ the deepest look so far at the investigation . ”
Titled “ Portrait Emerges of Anthrax Suspect ’s Troubled Life , ” it is primarily a hatchet job on Bruce Ivins .
Filled with innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations , the purpose of the article is clearly to solidify the perception that Ivins was the killer , and to pooh - pooh the widely held belief that the anthrax came from a CIA or military lab in Utah or Ohio .
Shane dismisses these beliefs breezily , stating : “ The Times review found that the FBI had disproved the assertion , widespread among scientists who believe Dr. Ivins was innocent , that the anthrax might have come from military and intelligence research programs in Utah or Ohio . ”
Not a single piece of evidence is presented to back up this sweeping claim .
Halfway through his article , Shane springs another shocker on us .
“ By early 2004 , FBI scientists had discovered that out of 60 domestic and foreign water samples , only water from Frederick , Maryland , had the same chemical signature as the water used to grow the mailed anthrax . ”
Really ?
Do FBI scientists think that anthrax researchers go to the kitchen sink for the water they use to grow the anthrax ?
According to Wikipedia , biochemistry labs use only highly purified water , such as double - distilled .
Distilled water is created by boiling water and collecting the steam .
To obtain double - distilled water , the process is done twice , so that all impurities and minerals are removed .
Distilled water has the same chemical signature , namely none , no matter where in the world it originates .
It is unprecedented to have a major development in a high profile case go unreported for a full five years .
Not only has the FBI never before mentioned this so - called discovery about the signature of the water , but when they were specifically asked if anything could be learned from the water , they said no .
The question came up on August 18 , 2008 , when the FBI held a science briefing to follow up on the highly publicized August 6 press conference by DOJ attorney Jeff Taylor .
The science briefing was hosted by Dr. Vahid Majidi , Assistant Director of the FBI Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate .
Dr. Majidi was asked : “ In your looking at the elemental and chemical properties , could you tell anything about the water that was used to filter this anthrax , and did that do you any good ? ”
Dr. Majidi replied : “ No. No . ”
Yet here we are , five months later , with Scott Shane telling us that the FBI has known since 2004 that the anthrax was grown near Fort Detrick , because of the chemical signature of the water .
Beyond these outrageous claims , Shane ’s article is busy assassinating Bruce Ivins ’ character .
We have Nancy Haigwood saying of Ivins “ he did it , ” for no apparent reason other than she does n’t like him and thinks he ’s odd .
She also thinks Ivins vandalized her house 27 years ago and impersonated her .
No reason is given for why she believes these things .
Shane editorializes heavily .
He charges that Ivins was “ chipper ” even as five people were dead or dying of anthrax inhalation , and was relishing his moment in the spotlight .
No evidence is presented for how Shane reached these conclusions about Ivins .
Words
Shane uses to describe Ivins ( including quotes from others ) are : corny , dour , scary , provocative , emotionally laden , thin - skinned , aggressive , goody two shoes , very sensitive , creepy , possessing an unnerving hubris , stressed , depressed , rude , sarcastic , nasty , devious , jumpy and agitated .
We find out that Ivins had been a nerdy , awkward teenager , was not popular in high school , and was still bitter about this .
He liked to eat a mixture of peas , yogurt and tuna for lunch and wore outdated bell - bottoms , practices that , according to Shane , got him labeled an “ oddball . ”
The words odd , oddball or oddities appear five times in Shane ’s article .
The final reference , regarding “ a man whose oddities , for many people , made the FBI ’s anthrax accusation more plausible , ” tips Shane ’s hand .
His constant harping on Ivins oddness betrays the poverty of the FBI ’s case , which Shane acknowledges has “ yielded nothing more persuasive than a strong hunch ” that Ivins was the killer .
Fortunately for many of us , being odd is not a crime .
But was Ivins odd ?
The Frederick News Post published a letter from Amanda Lane on August 10 , 2008 that includes : “ I want to shout from the mountain tops that Bruce was the kind of man we look up to . . .
He was a decorated scientist and the humblest of men who did n’t use his title as a status symbol .
He picked up a mop or emptied the trash without a moment ’s hesitation .
If he thought you were having a bad day he would offer candy or a catchy tune to cheer you up .
If someone had to stay late to accomplish a task , Bruce would work with you so that the task would get completed faster .
“ He was not the greatest athlete , but he was the best cheerleader present at every game to support his friends .
I will truly miss his good humor , as there are few people in life who measure up to this man .
I hope that he knew how much joy he brought to my life and others around him .
If I learned anything from Bruce , it was to enjoy life and to always smile .
His friendship brightened so many lives .
I hope that Americans will remember Bruce for the funny and compassionate person that he was , because that is all Bruce knew how to be . ”
Although Shane does mention that Ivins ’ colleagues cherished him , the implication is that they did n’t really know him , as “ he hid from them a shadow side of mental illness , alcoholism , secret obsessions and hints of violence . ”
The New York Times has published a hit piece , devoid of incriminating facts , more gossip than journalism .
Shane ’s article raises disturbing questions about the relationship between The New York Times and the US government .
What happened to the FBI ’s original focus on the CIA and Army labs ?
Who is behind the drive to pin the attacks on a dead man who possessed neither the means nor the motive to carry them out ?
And why is The Times acting as a PR arm for those with an agenda that has nothing to do with journalism ?

There are generally taken to be five vertical measures of note in type design ( from bottom to top ) : descender , baseline , midline * , caps - height , and ascender .
But if you delve into the minutiae of font design , you soon discover that there are a slew of important vertical metrics that are n’t much talked about .
In this article , I will take a look at several of these metrics , and how they are used in font design .
t - height
Take a look at the basic alphabet from the venerable Minion , with the top three measures highlighted across each glyph :
You ’ll note that the lowercase ‘ t ’ sticks out like a proverbial sore thumb .
The crossbar aligns with the font ’s x -height , but the top of the glyph is on a vertical plane all its own .
In my research , I find no accepted terminology to measure the top of the ‘ t ’ , and so I propose we give a name to this vertical metric ( simply enough ) : t- height .
The tradition for serif types is , like with Minion , for the crossbar of the ‘t ’ to be at the font ’s midline line , and for the top stem of the ‘t ’ to come up somewhere midway between the midline and the caps - height .
Typically , sans serif faces adhere to the same rule , as do slab serifs .
However , gothic and geometric sans faces often break with tradition and elevate the ‘t ’ to the ascender .
Handwriting fonts often do the same .
Overshoot
Looking at the string ‘ xoXO ’ , you might think that there are only three of the standard five vertical metrics in play : baseline , midline , and caps - height .
But if you view these glyphs at a larger size , you can see that the bottoms and the tops of the ‘ o ’ and ‘ O ’ overhang the baseline and their respective constraining heights .
This is standard practice in type design ; the reason being that if the ‘ o ’ and ‘ O ’ came exactly to the baseline and x-height / caps - height , it would appear to the naked eye as if they were smaller than other surrounding glyphs .
This goes for any glyph rounded on the top or bottom .
Here are some typical lowercase overshoots , top and then bottom :
And typical uppercase overshoots :
In principle , the overshoots should not be apparent to the eye at normal text sizes .
The whole idea of overshoots is that they make their glyphs appear to be the same height as flat - topped and flat - bottomed glyphs .
e -bar height
Typically , the bar of the ‘e ’ rests somewhere between halfway and two - thirds up from the baseline to the midline .
( It ’s extremely rare to find a typeface where the bar of the ‘e ’ is below the halfway point between the baseline and the x -height . )
Let ’s call the height of the center of the bar of the ‘ e ’ the e-bar height .
Here are Minion , Helvetica , Times New Roman , and Museo , and how their e-bar heights compare to the A - bar height and the x-junction height :
A - bar height
The A - bar height , taken as the measure from the baseline to the center of the bar of the ‘ A ’ , typically ranges from around 30 - 40 % of the distance from the baseline to the caps - height .
Incidentally , as you can see from the above image , the H - bar height is generally higher than the A - bar height .
This makes sense architecturally , if you think of the crossbars of these glyphs as providing a sort of balance .
The ‘ A ’ crossbar , if it were up at the height of the ‘ H ’ crossbar , would make the ‘ A ’ rather top - heavy .
R-Junction , P - Junction , B - Junction , and K - Junction heights
When I first started designing fonts , I thought , naively , that the junction points in the middle of the vertical bars of the ‘ R ’ , ‘ P’ , ‘ B ’ , and ‘ K ’ were all at the same height .
Would n’t it be easy if you could just design a ‘ P’ , and then just stick a leg on it for an ‘ R ’ , and another hoop on it for a ‘ B ’ ?
I soon learned better .
Here , once again , is Minion to show us the subtle variations in vertical metrics that make a font interesting :
Upon closer inspection , we can really see the different heights of these junctions .
Here ’s a close - up of the ‘ R ’ next to the ‘ P ’ .
Note that the P - junction height is slightly lower than the R- junction height .
The B- junction height is much higher than the R- junction height :
E-Junction and F - Junction heights
You might also suspect that the middle bars of the ‘ E ’ and ‘ F ’ would be at the same height , but this is not always the case .
In Minion , the E- junction height is slightly higher than the F - junction height .
You can see , also , that there is a wide variance of heights across the middles of some glyphs :
Look how strange Minion would look if all of these middle heights were the same :
And then some
We ’ve really just scratched the surface .
Well , I suppose we ’ve dug in a little more deeply than the surface , but there are still a great many more interesting vertical metrics we could explore .
G - bar height , briefly alluded to in the images above ; foot serif height , and head serif height ; two - storey a-junction height , or where the upper stroke of the bowl intersects with the vertical stem ; two - storey g- bowl height , or how high the upper bowl of the ‘ g ’ starts above the baseline .
If your interest is piqued , I highly recommend Karen Cheng ’s Designing Type , which is filled with wonderful analyses of minutiae like these .
* midline should not be confused with x -height ; strictly speaking , the x -height is the distance between baseline and midline .
Christian the Lion Email
Subject : Fw : True Love never dies ..... read first !
There 's no sound , but look at the picture first and then watch the video
These two guys reared this lion from a baby in England but the authorities would not allow them to keep it once it reached maturity so they were forced to give it up , they took it back to Africa and placed it in a wildlife sanctuary , a year later they went to see it and were told it would not remember them , true love never dies , how gorgeous .
There 's no sound , but look at the picture first and then watch the videoThese two guys reared this lion from a baby in England but the authorities would not allow them to keep it once it reached maturity so they were forced to give it up , they took it back to Africa and placed it in a wildlife sanctuary , a year later they went to see it and were told it would not remember them , true love never dies , how gorgeous .
He grew and grew - from 35lb when he first arrived to a rather more serious and imposing 185 lb a year later - and he was beginning to acquire a mane that made him look more fearsome .
He clearly could not stay with his two young owners for ever .
His future was decided by a chance encounter - when the actors Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna walked into the shop to buy a pine desk .
They had recently starred in the film Born Free , which tells the true story of the wildlife conservationist George Adamson and his wife Joy , who raised a lion cub called Elsa in Kenya then rehabilitated it into the wild .
And they immediately suggested that Adamson might be able to help .
Certainly , the conservationist was intrigued by the challenge of introducing a King 's Road lion to the wilds of Africa .
Email , with an attached photograph and video , tells the story of a lion that still remembered the two young men who raised it to maturity a year after it was released in an African wildlife sanctuary ( ) .
True( Submitted , February 2008 ) This message tells the story of a lion cub that was raised by two men in England and then relocated to an African wildlife sanctuary when it grew too big to keep at home .
According to the message and accompanying video clip , when the men visited the wildlife sanctuary a year later , the lion recognized them and approached to greet and play with them .
The story is true although the events described happened many years ago in the late 60's and early 70's .
Two young men , Anthony Bourke and John Rendall bought the lion cub from the Harrods department store , London , in 1969 .
They called the cub Christian .
Christian 's parents were zoo lions , so he was born in captivity .
In that somewhat simpler age , people could apparently buy exotic animals from department stores as well as keep them in normal human habitats without council or government restrictions .
For a year , Christian lived the high life at a furniture shop on the swinging King 's Road in Chelsea .
This urban cool cat cruised the streets in the back of a Bentley , attended lunches at a local restaurant and played football with his human companions in a nearby churchyard .
But , as Christian grew to adulthood , Anthony and John realized that his urban environment would not remain suitable for much longer .
An article about Christian in the UK's Daily Mail notes :
In 1970 , Christian was taken to Africa and eventually released on the Kora Reserve in Kenya with two other lions , Boy and Katania .
Boy later died , but Christian and Katania gradually adapted to life in the wild .
In later years , Anthony Bourke and John Rendall re-visited Kora and were reunited with their feline companion .
The Lion at World 's End , a documentary film about Christian , was released in 1971 as a companion to the book " A Lion Called Christian " by Anthony Bourke and John Rendall .
The film was also known as " Christian the Lion " and " The Lion That Thought He Was People " .
The movie clip that accompanies the email message is probably taken from this film .
According to the Daily Mail article , the men visited for the last time in 1974 .
Even though by that time Christian was living as a wild lion , he still recognized them and approached .
The trio romped and played together for some time before Christian returned to his pride .

ROME - ( ANSA ) - Italian footballers union AIC on Friday announced a 15 - minute delay to weekend play to protest a one - year doping ban handed down on two players who showed up late for a Serie B drugs test .
All matches in Serie A and B will start a quarter of an hour late in a show of solidarity with former Brescia winger Daniele Mannini , who is now at Serie A club Napoli , and Brescia striker Davide Possanzini .
The Italian Soccer Federation ( FIGC ) said Friday it would meet next Thursday with the Italian Olympic Committee ( CONI ) , Italian sport 's ruling body .
FIGC said it was already looking at possible recourse against Thursday 's ruling by world sport 's top court , the Lausanne - based Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) .
The universe is a lazy place .
If a system of particles can find a way exist in a lower - energy state , you ’d better believe that the system will seek it out .
A group of researchers from Amherst and Berkeley are capitalizing on this universal tendency toward calculated sloth by using self - assembly to create denser storage media .
Shaking a bag of Legos until they spontaneously form a TIE Fighter sounds absurd , yet self - assembly creates equally complex products all the time .
Adding a little bit of energy to a bunch of small parts often gives them the opportunity to seek out a stable , low - energy order .
We can see this in action at the breakfast table .
Those last Cheerios are n’t clinging to each other for dear life — they ’re seeking out a way to minimize surface tension in the milk .
Whitesides at MIT has used the same principle to demonstrate self - assembly in small hexagonal tiles .
Thomas Russel , Ting Xu , and their associates are doing the same thing on a molecular level .
Self assembled monolayers , or SAMS , are a special class of self - assembled structures that form an ultrathin and highly ordered film on a surface .
They are the basis of DNA microarrays , protective coatings on micromachines , and Rain - X .
In nature , we see them in cells ’ lipid bilayer membranes .
Other researchers have been exploring the use of block - copolymer SAMS for data storage surfaces , but their efforts met with a fatal flaw — or rather , many of them .
It ’s difficult to pattern polymers in a dependably crystalline pattern .
The Amherst / Berkeley group overcame this by using a templated surface to guide and control the dense assembly of their polymer .
They started with a sapphire wafer that had been treated to have a pronounced molecular scaled stepped pattern , a perfect seat for incoming polymer molecules .
Compare this to a bowl of Cheerios with a set of ridges on one side .
The Cheerios will naturally flock there , once again trying to minimize the surface tension .
This first layer of Cheerios attracts more Cheerios , and soon you no longer have to chase them around the bowl with a spoon .
On the molecular level , this stepped surface promotes flawless arrangement of polymer molecules .
Varying the step size offers further control over the density .
This is important in the creation of storage devices , because a high density means that smaller features can be used to store data .
The current cutting edge is about 1 terabit per square inch .
A flawless square inch of this templated polymer can store ten terabits — that ’s like ten of the very best iPods , and 300,000 songs .
The use of a templated surface to direct self - assembly may be novel in microelectronics , but it ’s extremely reminiscent of another great self - assembled data storage unit : DNA .
Understanding the templated assembly mechanism of DNA provided the foundation for polymerase chain reaction , or PCR .
Vastly simplified , PCR uses a single helix of DNA as its patterned surface , attracting the assembly of a new chain of complementary nucleotides .
When a complete double helix is assembled , it is split , yielding two single - stranded DNA helices — two patterned surfaces to attract two new sets of nucleotides .
Each cycle of PCR provides new templated strands , and new DNA , until enough copies have been made to perform experiments .
This DNA cloning technique enabled huge advances in genetics , and was instrumental in the human genome project .
Not bad for a bunch of lazy molecules .

The newest police atrocity to receive significant media coverage — - the killing of Oscar Grant at an Oakland BART station by a police officer on New Years Day — - was caught on tape and widely distributed .
It has now been watched half a million times .
Could this mean the beginning of a shift in the way police abuses are handled in American society ?
Upon seeing the videotape , a former DEA agent and expert on “ use - of - force ” cases , said , “ It ’s clear it was not a use - of - deadly - force situation .
. . .
You ’ve got more than enough manpower there to handle these guys . ”
Many others defend the police conduct , coming up with all sorts of excuses and appealing to the high stress situations in which police find themselves .
But consider when the tables are turned .
When a normal member of the public mistakenly shoots a police officer , even in a much higher - stress situation , even when it is on his own property and he would normally have the legal right to shoot the intruder , he is n’t let off so easily .
See the case of Cory Maye .
Accidents do happen , and police officers often commit excessively violent acts not out of malice but because of a range of factors , including stress .
But certainly they are more likely to hurt the innocent and use disproportionate force due to the default legal protection they enjoy as officers of the law , the assumption that their use of violence is just and legal , and the power they have to enforce many laws that would not in a free society be laws at all .
The increasing tendency of police to rely on tasers for routine crowd control is a real concern , as is the general expansion and militarization of domestic police forces .
To make excesses and abuses of police state power much less likely , the power itself must be radically reduced .
Most important , police should not be above the law , and should be held to the precise same standards of law and justice as is everyone else .
Lots of people live in dangerous situations in this country , and the leeway given to an officer for unnecessarily killing a citizen when there are mitigating circumstances should be no greater than if the situation were reversed .

As unpleasant and frightening as it may be for parents to think about the possibility of their child being hurt by a predator , it ’s crucial that parents talk with their kids about personal safety .
Teaching your child how to protect himself against child predators is as important as other measures you use every day to keep him safe , such as making sure he uses a seat belt .
By teaching your child how to avoid possible dangers and what to do if he finds himself in a potentially threatening situation , you will empower your child to know what to do in the event you are not there to protect him .
Here are some important tips every parent should know about how to keep your child safe .
Important Tips
Teach your child the power of " No . "
Child predators are very good at seeking out children who may be afraid or reluctant to oppose an adult , or who may be easily threatened or coerced .
Tell your child to trust her instincts if she does not feel comfortable or is scared around someone , to tell that person in a very loud voice , " No ! " if she is asked to keep a secret or go somewhere with that person without you , and to tell you immediately about what happened .
Do n’t assume your child will know what to do .
In his book " Protecting The Gift : Keeping Children and Teenagers Safe ( and Parents Sane ) , " security consultant Gavin de Becker mentions a classic segment of The Oprah Winfrey Show that aired in 1993 .
In the show , Oprah producers and child safety advocate Ken Wooden conducted an experiment ( with the parents ’ permission ) in which they were able to successfully lure away every single child participating in the test out of the playground in an average of 35 seconds .
Before the experiment , the parents had insisted that their child would not talk to a stranger or leave the park with someone he or she did n’t know .
Needless to say , they were wrong to assume that their child would not be vulnerable .
Do n’t focus on " stranger danger . "
For children , especially younger kids , the concept of just who exactly is a " stranger " can be confusing .
They may picture someone who is scary - looking , or who is mean .
In fact , child safety experts have shown in experiments such as the one mentioned above that children will often follow someone if that person appears friendly and is persuasive enough ( by asking a child to help them find a lost puppy , for instance ) .
Moreover , as de Becker notes in " Protecting the Gift , " by telling a child to not trust strangers , parents are implicitly saying that it ’s OK to trust people he may know casually , such as a neighbor or a waiter at a restaurant .
Singling out strangers as dangerous does not address the fact that dangers to children are greater from someone known to them or you than by a stranger , notes Nancy McBride , National Safety Director at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) .
Instead of telling your child not to ever talk to strangers , which may , in fact , deter him from seeking help when he is lost , teach him to find a woman — preferably one who is with a child — and ask her to call 911 or call his parents and tell them where he is .
Other options : " Tell your child to go to a sales clerk with a name tag , uniformed law enforcement officer , or a person at an information booth , " says McBride .
And if you see a child who appears to be lost ?
NCMEC produced a piece called , " What Should You Do If You See a Child Who Appears To Be Lost ? " to help people know what to do if they encounter a child who seems to be in need of assistance finding his parents or caregiver .
Tell your child that no one should ever invade her personal space .
Whether in a public space or at home , emphasize to your child that no one should ever get too close to her without a caregiver or one of her parents present .
Designate trusted adults .
Make a shortlist of " safe " grown - ups — such as an uncle , babysitter , grandparent or neighbor — who are allowed to pick her up from school or take care of her when you are not there or are late for pick up .
Tell her to never go with anyone else unless you have agreed beforehand to deviate from the list , and always make sure she knows exactly who will be picking her up .
Tell him to never , ever get in a car or go somewhere without a parent or caregiver .
Emphasize to your child that if someone he knows ( but is not a designated trusted adult ) or someone he ’s never met before tries to convince or force him to go somewhere with him , then he should scream as loudly as he can , " Help !
This is not my dad ! " or " Help !
This is not my mom ! "
Tell him that he should also run , and if he is grabbed , that he should punch , hit and kick as strongly as he can .
Do n’t instill fear .
Just turning on the evening news is enough to make children — and adults — feel as if there ’s danger lurking in every corner .
Fear of every situation can actually be counter - productive and can make a child so afraid of everything that he is vulnerable to being manipulated by threats .
Instead , give your child the confidence , strength , and tools to prevent and manage potential danger .
Rather than focusing on every danger your child could face , empower your child by talking to him about how he would recognize and avoid potentially dangerous situations and handle certain unexpected scenarios .
For instance , what would he do if he were accidentally separated from you in a public place ?
( Answer : Look for a woman with a child or baby and ask her for help . )
Or what ’s the best way to handle it when someone he knows — say , a neighbor or a friend of the family — ask him to come with him , claiming that you sent him to get you in an emergency ?
( Answer : Know that only designated trusted adults previously named by you — such as a grandparent or another relative — and no one else is allowed to come and get him . )
Use resources for kids .
Watch videos such as The Safe Side — Stranger Safety : Hot Tips To Keep Cool Kids Safe With People They Don't Know And Kinda Know , featuring John Walsh with your child .
The Safe Side website also features resources designed for kids such as quizzes , puzzles , and safety tips .
The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) also has a wealth of free child safety resources for parents , guardians , and children at Missingkids.com .
Repeat these messages .
Just as you would with fire drills , practice these safety tips periodically with your child .
( Do this especially right at back to school time and at the beginning of summer , when your kids are likely to be outside more — a fact that is all too well known to predators ) .
When you are outside in a crowded place such as a mall or a park , ask your child what she would do if you were to be separated .
Which of the people around you would she go to for help ?
Point out to her some of the people who could assist her .
Does she remember your cell phone number ?

Day , we are starting off the day pretty well .
The New Jersey Civil Unions Review Commission was created by the legislature to analyze the effects of civil unions within the state .
The commission has found that civil unions are separate and unequal and have noted many instances where same - sex couples and their children are being treated unfairly due to this second - class citizen law .
The commissions report recommends the governor and legislature act quickly to enact full marriage equality for the state of New Jersey .
AM - Thursday , 5 February , 2009 08:12:00 Reporter : Shane McLeod TONY EASTLEY : Australia 's south - east is still in the grip of drought but scientists believe they might have a better idea of what 's causing the big dry .
In recent years , the so - called El Nino effect has figured in the thinking based on rises and falls in sea temperatures in the Pacific Ocean .
But new research suggests it might actually be the waters on the other side of Australia that are to blame .
Environment reporter Shane McLeod has the story .
SHANE MCLEOD : Australians and especially Australian farmers have known since the 1980s that ocean temperature cycles like the so - called El Nino effect , or southern oscillation , have a big impact on rainfall .
But tracking the cycles in the Pacific Ocean has n't brought much joy to farmers in south - eastern Australia who 've watched La Nina phases come and go without delivering much hoped for rain .
Now climate scientists at the University of New South Wales in Sydney believe they know why that 's happened .
Dr Caroline Ummenhofer is the author of a new paper on the role of the Indian Ocean in Australia 's climate .
CAROLINE UMMENHOFER :
Whenever we 've looked at these drought periods we 've seen a conspicuous absence of one phase of the Indian Ocean dipole , the negative phase , that normally brings wet conditions to south - eastern Australia .
And this has been conspicuously absent during all these periods .
SHANE MCLEOD : The Indian Ocean dipole is a cousin of the southern oscillation but obviously tracking temperatures in the waters to Australia 's west .
It moves through two distinct phases .
In what 's called the negative phase , warm water in the central Indian drives strong moist winds across Indonesia and down through north - western Australia , bringing good seasonal rains into Victoria and Tasmania .
In the positive phase , the reverse occurs with weaker drier winds drawing little rain across the Australian continent .
The researchers have found that since the early 1990s the dipole has n't headed into negative territory , coinciding with what 's become known as the big dry .
Going back through the records , they 've found the dipole 's behaviour correlates with major droughts stretching back a century .
Professor Matthew England heads the university 's Climate Change Research Centre .
MATTHEW ENGLAND :
When it cycles between cold and warm phases it dictates how much moist air comes down to southern Australia .
You can see it on the weather maps on the nightly news .
You see these bursts of cloud , north - west cloud bands tracking down the continent from the north - west shelf region .
And it's that driver of rainfall that we 've identified as controlling this drought cycle to the south - east of Australia .
Really it 's the Victorian region is kind of , at the moment seems to be slave to what 's happening in the Indian Ocean .
SHANE MCLEOD :
The question now is whether the phenomenon can be accurately predicted and whether global warming might cause it to change its behaviour .
Professor England again :
MATTHEW ENGLAND :
It 's alarming to see the frequency of them drop off over the last 20 or 30 years .
We 'd like a system where the rain relief comes every two or three years through the cycle and that 's what happened previously .
But certainly the fact that in the last 20 or 30 years we 've seen a decline of these events is alarming .
The link to climate change is not yet made but there 's certainly a trend there we'd like to know more about .

M104 Hubble Remix
The striking spiral galaxy M104 is famous for its nearly edge - on profile featuring a broad ring of obscuring dust .
Seen in silhouette against a bright bulge of stars , the swath of cosmic dust lanes lends a hat - like appearance to the galaxy in optical images suggesting the more popular moniker , The Sombrero Galaxy .
Here , Hubble Space Telescope archival image data has been reprocessed to create this alternative look at the well - known galaxy .
The newly developed processing improves the visibility of details otherwise lost in overwhelming glare , in this case allowing features of the galaxy ’s dust lanes to be followed well into the bright central region .
About 50,000 light - years across and 28 million light - years away , M104 is one of the largest galaxies at the southern edge of the Virgo Galaxy Cluster .
Star Forming Region LH 95
How do stars form ?
To better understand this complex and chaotic process , astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to image in unprecedented detail the star forming region LH 95 in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy .
Usually only the brightest , bluest , most massive stars in a star forming region are visible , but the above image was taken in such high resolution and in such specific colors that many recently formed stars that are more yellow , more dim , and less massive are also discernable .
Also visible in the above scientifically colored image is a blue sheen of diffuse hydrogen gas heated by the young stars , and dark dust created by stars or during supernova explosions .
Studying the locations and abundances of lower mass stars in star forming regions and around molecular clouds helps uncover what conditions were present when they formed .
LH 95 spans about 150 light years and lies about 160,000 light years away toward the southern constellation of the Swordfish .
M78 and Reflecting Dust Clouds in Orion
An eerie blue glow and ominous columns of dark dust highlight M78 and other bright reflection nebula in the constellation of Orion .
The dark filamentary dust not only absorbs light , but also reflects the light of several bright blue stars that formed recently in the nebula .
Of the two reflection nebulas pictured above , the more famous nebula is M78 , on the upper right , while NGC 2071 can be seen to its lower left .
The same type of scattering that colors the daytime sky further enhances the blue color .
M78 is about five light - years across and visible through a small telescope .
M78 appears above only as it was 1600 years ago , however , because that is how long it takes light to go from there to here .
M78 belongs to the larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex that contains the Great Nebula in Orion and the Horsehead Nebula .
Phobos : Doomed Moon of Mars
This moon is doomed .
Mars , the red planet named for the Roman god of war , has two tiny moons , Phobos and Deimos , whose names are derived from the Greek for Fear and Panic .
These martian moons may well be captured asteroids originating in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter or perhaps from even more distant reaches of the Solar System .
The larger moon , Phobos , is indeed seen to be a cratered , asteroid - like object in this stunning color image from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , recorded at a resolution of about seven meters per pixel .
But Phobos orbits so close to Mars – about 5,800 kilometers above the surface compared to 400,000 kilometers for our Moon – that gravitational tidal forces are dragging it down .
In 100 million years or so Phobos will likely be shattered by stress caused by the relentless tidal forces , the debris forming a decaying ring around Mars .
A Protected Night Sky Over Flagstaff
This sky is protected .
On the day of NASA 50 year anniversary of the first lighting ordinance ever enacted , which restricted searchlight advertisements from sweeping the night skies above Flagstaff , Arizona , USA .
Flagstaff now enjoys the status of being the first International Dark Sky City , and maintains a lighting code that limits lights from polluting this majestic nighttime view .
The current dark skies over Flagstaff not only enable local astronomers to decode the universe but allow local sky enthusiasts to see and enjoy a tapestry contemplated previously by every human generation .
The above image , pointing just east of north , was taken from Fort Valley , only 10 kilometers from central Flagstaff .
Visible in the above spectacular panorama are the San Francisco Peaks caped by a lenticular cloud .
Far in the distance , the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy arcs diagonally from the lower left to the upper right , highlighted by the constellations of Cassiopeia , Cepheus , and Cygnus .
On the far right , the North America Nebula is visible just under the very bright star Deneb .
Gripped by an astronomical spring fever , many northern hemisphere stargazers embark on a Messier Marathon .
Completing the marathon requires viewing all 110 objects in 18th century French astronomer Charles Messier ’s catalog in one glorious dusk - to - dawn observing run .
Shaping NGC 6188
Dark shapes with bright edges winging their way through dusty NGC 6188 are tens of light - years long .
The emission nebula is found near the edge of an otherwise dark large molecular cloud in the southern constellation Ara , about 4,000 light - years away .
Formed in that region only a few million years ago , the massive young stars of the embedded Ara OB1 association sculpt the fantastic shapes and power the nebular glow with stellar winds and intense ultraviolet radiation .
The recent star formation itself was likely triggered by winds and supernova explosions , from previous generations of massive stars , that swept up and compressed the molecular gas .
A false - color Hubble palette was used to create the this gorgeous wide - field image and shows emission from sulfur , hydrogen , and oxygen atoms in red , green , and blue hues .
At the estimated distance of NGC 6188 , the picture spans about 300 light - years .
Galaxies Collide in NGC 3256
Galaxies do n’t normally look like this .
NGC 3256 actually shows a current picture of two galaxies that are slowly colliding .
Quite possibly , in hundreds of millions of years , only one galaxy will remain .
Today , however , NGC 3256 shows intricate filaments of dark dust , unusual tidal tails of stars , and a peculiar center that contains two distinct nuclei .
Although it is likely that no stars in the two galaxies will directly collide , the gas , dust , and ambient magnetic fields do interact directly .
NGC 3256 , part of the vast Hydra - Centaurus supercluster of galaxies , spans over 100 thousand light - years across and is located about 100 million light - years away .
The Dark Tower in Scorpius
In silhouette against a crowded star field toward the constellation Scorpius , this dusty cosmic cloud evokes for some the image of an ominous dark tower .
In fact , clumps of dust and molecular gas collapsing to form stars may well lurk within the dark nebula , a structure that spans almost 40 light - years across the gorgeous telescopic view .
Known as a cometary globule , the swept - back cloud , extending from the upper right to the head ( top of the tower ) left and below center , is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the OB association of very hot stars in NGC 6231 , off the left edge of the scene .
That energetic ultraviolet light also powers the globule ’s bordering reddish glow of hydrogen gas .
Hot stars embedded in the dust can be seen as small bluish reflection nebulae .
This dark tower , NGC 6231 , and associated nebulae are about 5,000 light - years away .
Sideways Galaxy NGC 3628
Dark dust lanes cut across the middle of this gorgeous island universe , a strong hint that NGC 3628 is a spiral galaxy seen sideways .
About 35 million light - years away in the northern springtime constellation Leo , NGC 3628 also bears the distinction of being the only member of the well known Leo triplet of galaxies not in Charles Messier ’s famous catalog .
Otherwise similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy , the disk of NGC 3628 is clearly seen to fan out near the edges .
A faint arm of material also extends to the left in this sharp and deep view of the region .
he distorted shape and faint tidal tail suggest that NGC 3628 is interacting gravitationally with the other spiral galaxies in the Leo triplet , M66 and M65 .
Where did the gold in your jewelry originate ?
No one is completely sure .
The relative average abundance in our Solar System appears higher than can be made in the early universe , in stars , and even in typical supernova explosions .
Some astronomers have recently suggested that neutron - rich heavy elements such as gold might be most easily made in rare neutron - rich explosions such as the collision of neutron stars .
Pictured above is an artist ’s illustration depicting two neutron stars spiraling in toward each other , just before they collide .
Since neutron star collisions are also suggested as the origin of short duration gamma-ray bursts , it is possible that you already own a souvenir from one of the most powerful explosions in the universe .
Inside the Coma Cluster of Galaxies
Almost every object in the above photograph is a galaxy .
The Coma Cluster of Galaxies pictured above is one of the densest clusters known – it contains thousands of galaxies .
Each of these galaxies houses billions of stars – just as our own Milky Way Galaxy does .
Although nearby when compared to most other clusters , light from the Coma Cluster still takes hundreds of millions of years to reach us .
In fact , the Coma Cluster is so big it takes light millions of years just to go from one side to the other !
The above mosaic of images of a small portion of Coma was taken in unprecedented detail by the Hubble Space Telescope to investigate how galaxies in rich clusters form and evolve .
Most galaxies in Coma and other clusters are ellipticals , although some imaged here are clearly spirals .
The spiral galaxy on the upper left of the above image can also be found as one of the bluer galaxies on the upper left of this wider field image .
In the background thousands of unrelated galaxies are visible far across the universe .
Eta Carinae and the Homunculus Nebula
How did the star Eta Carinae create this unusual nebula ?
No one knows for sure .
About 165 years ago , the southern star Eta Carinae mysteriously became the second brightest star in the night sky .
In 20 years , after ejecting more mass than our Sun , Eta Car unexpectedly faded .
This outburst appears to have created the Homunculus Nebula , pictured above in a composite image from the Hubble Space Telescope taken last decade .
Visible in the above image center is purple - tinted light reflected from the violent star Eta Carinae itself .
Surrounding this star are expanding lobes of gas laced with filaments of dark dust .
Jets bisect the lobes emanating from the central star .
Surrounding these lobes are red - tinted debris captured only by its glow in a narrow band of red light .
This debris is expanding most quickly of all , and includes streaming whiskers and bow shocks caused by collisions with previously existing material .
Eta Car still undergoes unexpected outbursts , and its high mass and volatility make it a candidate to explode in a spectacular supernova sometime in the next few million years .
Pickering ’s Triangle from Kitt Peak
Wisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star .
About 7,500 years ago that star exploded in a supernova leaving the Veil Nebula , also known as the Cygnus Loop .
At the time , the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent Moon , remaining visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history .
Today , the resulting supernova remnant has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the constellation of Cygnus .
The remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge , however , and even though it lies about 1,400 light - years distant , it covers over five times the size of the full Moon .
In images of the complete Veil Nebula , studious readers should be able to identify the Pickering ’s Triangle component pictured above , a component named for a famous astronomer and the wisp ’s approximate shape .
The above image is a mosaic from the 4 - meter Mayall telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory located in Arizona , USA .
SN 1006 Supernova Remnant
A new star , likely the brightest supernova in recorded human history , lit up planet Earth ’s sky in the year 1006 AD .
The expanding debris cloud from the stellar explosion , found in the southerly constellation of Lupus , still puts on a cosmic light show across the electromagnetic spectrum .
In fact , this composite view includes X - ray data in blue from the Chandra Observatory , optical data in yellowish hues , and radio image data in red .
Now known as the SN 1006 supernova remnant , the debris cloud appears to be about 60 light - years across and is understood to represent the remains of a white dwarf star .
Part of a binary star system , the compact white dwarf gradually captured material from its companion star .
The buildup in mass finally triggered a thermonuclear explosion that destroyed the dwarf star .
Because the distance to the supernova remnant is about 7,000 light - years , that explosion actually happened 7,000 years before the light reached Earth in 1006 .
Shockwaves in the remnant accelerate particles to extreme energies and are thought to be a source of the mysterious cosmic rays .
Gas and Dust of the Lagoon Nebula
This beautiful cosmic cloud is a popular stop on telescopic tours of the constellation Sagittarius .
Eighteenth century cosmic tourist Charles Messier cataloged the bright nebula as M8 , while modern day astronomers recognize the Lagoon Nebula as an active stellar nursery about 5,000 light - years distant , in the direction of the center of our Milky Way Galaxy .
Striking details can be traced through this remarkable picture , processed to remove stars and hence better reveal the Lagoon ’s range of filaments of glowing hydrogen gas , dark dust clouds , and the bright , turbulent hourglass region near the image center .
This color composite view was recorded under dark skies near Sydney , Australia .
IC 4406 : A Seemingly Square Nebula
How can a round star make a square nebula ?
This conundrum comes to light when studying planetary nebulae like IC 4406 .
Evidence indicates that IC 4406 is likely a hollow cylinder , with its square appearance the result of our vantage point in viewing the cylinder from the side .
Were IC 4406 viewed from the top , it would likely look similar to the Ring Nebula .
Hot gas flows out the ends of the cylinder , while filaments of dark dust and molecular gas lace the bounding walls .
The star primarily responsible for this interstellar sculpture can be found in the planetary nebula ’s center .
In a few million years , the only thing left visible in IC 4406 will be a fading white dwarf star .
Open Cluster NGC 290 : A Stellar Jewel Box
Jewels do n’t shine this bright — only stars do .
Like gems in a jewel box , though , the stars of open cluster NGC 290 glitter in a beautiful display of brightness and color .
The photogenic cluster , pictured above , was captured recently by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope .
Open clusters of stars are younger , contain few stars , and contain a much higher fraction of blue stars than do globular clusters of stars .
NGC 290 lies about 200,000 light - years distant in a neighboring galaxy called the Small Cloud of Magellan ( SMC ) .
The open cluster contains hundreds of stars and spans about 65 light years across .
NGC 290 and other open clusters are good laboratories for studying how stars of different masses evolve , since all the open cluster ’s stars were born at about the same time .
X - Rays from the Cat’s Eye Nebula
Haunting patterns within planetary nebula NGC 6543 readily suggest its popular moniker — the Cat ’s Eye nebula .
Stunning false - color optical images from the Hubble Space Telescope detailed the swirls of this glowing nebula , known to be the gaseous shroud expelled from a dying sun-like star about 3,000 light - years from Earth .
This composite picture combines the latest Hubble optical image of the Cat ’s Eye with new x-ray data from the orbiting Chandra Observatory and reveals surprisingly intense x-ray emission indicating the presence of extremely hot gas .
X - ray emission is shown as blue - purple hues superimposed on the nebula ’s center .
The nebula ’s central star itself is clearly immersed in the multimillion degree , x-ray emitting gas
Other pockets of x-ray hot gas seem to be bordered by cooler gas emitting strongly at optical wavelengths , a clear indication that expanding hot gas is sculpting the visible Cat ’s Eye filaments and structures .
Gazing into the Cat’s Eye , astronomers see the fate of our sun , destined to enter its own planetary nebula phase of evolution … in about 5 billion years .
At the Sun ’s Edge
A train trip on the Trans - Siberian railway to Novosibirsk resulted in this stunning view along the edge of the Sun recorded during the August 1st total solar eclipse .
The picture is a composite of two images taken at special moments in the eclipse sequence , corresponding to the very beginning and the very end of the total eclipse phase .
Those times are known to eclipse chasers as 2nd and 3rd contact .
Bright beads around the Moon ’s dark silhouette are rays of sunlight shining through lunar valleys at the edge of the lunar disk .
But the composite view also captures solar prominences , looping structures of hot plasma suspended in magnetic fields , extending beyond the Sun ’s edge .
The Crown of the Sun
During a total solar eclipse , the Sun ’s extensive outer atmosphere , or corona , is an inspirational sight .
The subtle shades and shimmering features of the corona that engage the eye span a brightness range of over 10,000 to 1 , making them notoriously difficult to capture in a single picture .
But this composite of 28 digital images ranging in exposure time from 1/1000 to 2 seconds comes close to revealing the crown of the Sun in all its glory .
The telescopic views were recorded near Kochenevo , Russia during the August 1 total solar eclipse and also show solar prominences extending just beyond the edge of the eclipsed sun .
Remarkably , features on the dark near side of the New Moon can also be made out , illuminated by sunlight reflected from a Full Earth .
Black Hole Candidate Cygnus X- 1
Is that a black hole ?
Quite possibly .
The Cygnus X - 1 binary star system contains one of the best candidates for a black hole .
he system was discovered because it is one of the brightest X - ray sources on the sky , shining so bright it was detected by the earliest rockets carrying cameras capable of seeing the previously unknown X - ray sky .
The star ’s very name indicates that it is the single brightest X - ray source in the constellation of the Swan Cygnus .
Data indicate that a compact object there contains about nine times the mass of the Sun and changes its brightness continually on several time scales , at least down to milliseconds .
Such behavior is expected for a black hole , and difficult to explain with other models .
Pictured above is an artistic impression of the Cygnus X - 1 system .
On the left is the bright blue supergiant star designated HDE 226868 , which is estimated as having about 30 times the mass of our Sun.
Cygnus X - 1 is depicted on the right , connected to its supergiant companion by a stream of gas , and surrounded by an impressive accretion disk .
The bright star in the Cygnus X - 1 system is visible with a small telescope .
Strangely , the Cygnus X - 1 black hole candidate appears to have formed without a bright supernova explosion .
NGC 6888 : The Crescent Nebula
NGC 6888 , also known as the Crescent Nebula , is a cosmic bubble about 25 light - years across , blown by winds from its central , bright , massive star .
This beautiful telescopic view combines a composite color image with narrow band data that isolates light from hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the wind - blown nebula .
The oxygen atoms produce the blue - green hue that seems to enshroud the detailed folds and filaments .
NGC 6888 ′s central star is classified as a Wolf - Rayet star ( WR 136 ) .
The star is shedding its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind , ejecting the equivalent of the Sun ’s mass every 10,000 years .
The nebula ’s complex structures are likely the result of this strong wind interacting with material ejected in an earlier phase .
Burning fuel at a prodigious rate and near the end of its stellar life this star should ultimately go out with a bang in a spectacular supernova explosion .
Found in the nebula rich constellation Cygnus , NGC 6888 is about 5,000 light - years away .
Perseid over Vancouver
Colorful and bright , the city lights of Vancouver , Canada are reflected in the water in this portrait of the world at night .
Recorded on August 12 during the Perseid Meteor Shower , the wide - angle view takes in a large swath along the photographer ’s eastern horizon .
The picture is a composite of many consecutive 2 second exposures that , when added together , cover a total time of an hour and 33 minutes .
During that time , stars trailed through the night sky above Vancouver , their steady motion along concentric arcs a reflection of planet Earth ’s rotation .
The dotted trails of aircraft also cut across the scene .
Of course , two of the frames captured the brief , brilliant flash of a Perseid fireball as it tracked across the top of the field of view .
The large gap in the single meteor trail corresponds to the time gap between the consecutive frames .
Baily ’s Beads near Solar Eclipse Totality
Just before the Sun blacks out , something strange occurs .
As the Moon moves to completely cover the Sun in a total solar eclipse , beads of bright sunlight stream around the edge of the Moon .
This effect , known as Baily ’s beads , is named after Francis Baily who called attention to the phenomenon in 1836 .
Although , the number and brightness of Baily ’s beads used to be unpredictable , today the Moon is so well mapped that general features regarding Baily ’s beads are expected .
When a single bead dominates , it is called the diamond ring effect , and is typically seen just before totality .
Pictured above , a series of images recorded Baily ’s beads at times surrounding the recent total solar eclipse visible from Novosibirsk , Russia .
The complete series can be seen by scrolling right .
At the end of totality , as the Sun again emerges from behind the moon , Baily ’s beads may again be visible — but now on the other side of the Moon .
NGC 6960 : The Witch ’s Broom Nebula
Ten thousand years ago , before the dawn of recorded human history , a new light must suddenly have appeared in the night sky and faded after a few weeks .
Today we know this light was an exploding star and record the colorful expanding cloud as the Veil Nebula .
Pictured above is the west end of the Veil Nebula known technically as NGC 6960 but less formally as the Witch ’s Broom Nebula .
The expanding debris cloud gains its colors by sweeping up and exciting existing nearby gas .
The supernova remnant lies about 1400 light - years away towards the constellation of Cygnus .
This Witch ’s Broom actually spans over three times the angular size of the full Moon .
The bright star 52 Cygni is visible with the unaided eye from a dark location but unrelated to the ancient supernova .
The Matter of the Bullet Cluster
The matter in galaxy cluster 1E 0657 - 56 , fondly known as the “ bullet cluster ” , is shown in this composite image .
A mere 3.4 billion light - years away , the bullet cluster ’s individual galaxies are seen in the optical image data , but their total mass adds up to far less than the mass of the cluster ’s two clouds of hot x-ray emitting gas shown in red .
Representing even more mass than the optical galaxies and x-ray gas combined , the blue hues show the distribution of dark matter in the cluster .
Otherwise invisible to telescopic views , the dark matter was mapped by observations of gravitational lensing of background galaxies .
In a text book example of a shock front , the bullet - shaped cloud of gas at the right was distorted during the titanic collision between two galaxy clusters that created the larger bullet cluster itself .
But the dark matter present has not interacted with the cluster gas except by gravity .
The clear separation of dark matter and gas clouds is considered direct evidence that dark matter exists .
47 Tuc : A Great Globular Cluster of Stars
Stars come in bunches .
Of the over 200 globular star clusters that orbit the center of our Milky Way Galaxy , 47 Tucanae is the second brightest globular cluster ( behind Omega Centauri ) .
Light takes about 13,000 years to reach us from 47 Tuc which can be seen on the sky near the Small Magellanic Cloud in the southern constellation of Tucana .
Also known as NGC 104 , the dense cluster is made up of several million stars in a volume only about 120 light - years across .
The cluster ’s red giant stars are particularly easy to see in this picture .
The globular cluster is also home to exotic x-ray binary star systems .
NGC 1316 : After Galaxies Collide
Astronomers turn detectives when trying to figure out the cause of startling sights like NGC 1316 .
Their investigation indicates that NGC 1316 is an enormous elliptical galaxy that started , about 100 million years ago , to devour a smaller spiral galaxy neighbor , NGC 1317 , just above it .
Supporting evidence includes the dark dust lanes characteristic of a spiral galaxy , and faint swirls of stars and gas visible in this wide and deep image .
What remains unexplained are the unusually small globular star clusters , seen as faint dots on the image .
Most elliptical galaxies have more and brighter globular clusters than NGC 1316 .
Yet the observed globulars are too old to have been created by the recent spiral collision .
One hypothesis is that these globulars survive from an even earlier galaxy that was subsumed into NGC 1316 .
Spokes in the Helix Nebula
At first glance , the Helix Nebula ( aka NGC 7293 ) , looks simple and round .
But this well - studied example of a planetary nebula , produced near the end of the life of a sun- like star , is now understood to have a surprisingly complex geometry .
Its extended loops and comet - shaped features have been explored in Hubble Space Telescope images .
Still , a 16 - inch diameter telescope and camera with broad and narrow band filters was used to create this sharp view of the Helix .
The color composite also reveals the nebula ’s intriguing details , including light - year long , bluegreen radial stripes or spokes that give it the appearance of a cosmic bicycle wheel .
The spoke features seem to indicate that the Helix Nebula is itself an old and evolved planetary nebula .
The Helix is a mere seven hundred light years from Earth , in the constellation Aquarius .
A Flock of Stars
Only a few stars can be found within ten light - years of our lonely Sun , situated near an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy .
But if the Sun were found within one of our galaxy ’s star clusters , thousands of stars might occupy a similar space .
What would the night sky look like in such a densely packed stellar neighborhood ?
When Roger Hopkins took this picture at the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge in the Finger Lakes region of western New York , USA , he was struck by this same notion .
Appropriately , he had photographed a flock of starlings against the backdrop of a serene sunset .
He then manipulated the image so that the black bird silhouettes were changed to white .
The final picture dramatically suggests the tantalizing spectacle of approaching night in crowded skies above a cluster star world .
M110 : Satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy
Our Milky Way Galaxy is not alone .
It is part of a gathering of about 25 galaxies known as the Local Group .
Members include the Great Andromeda Galaxy ( M31 ) , M32 , M33 , the Large Magellanic Cloud , the Small Magellanic Cloud , Dwingeloo 1 , several small irregular galaxies , and many dwarf elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies .
Pictured on the lower right is one of the dwarf ellipticals : NGC 205 .
Like M32 , NGC 205 is a companion to the large M31 , and can sometimes be seen to the south of M31′s center in photographs .
The image shows NGC 205 to be unusual for an elliptical galaxy in that it contains at least two dust clouds ( at 9 and 2 o’clock – they are visible but hard to spot ) and signs of recent star formation .
This galaxy is sometimes known as M110 , although it was actually not part of Messier ’s original catalog .
SN 1006 : A Supernova Ribbon from Hubble
What created this unusual space ribbon ?
Most assuredly , one of the most violent explosions ever witnessed by ancient humans .
ack in the year 1006 AD , light reached Earth from a stellar explosion in the constellation of the Wolf ( Lupus ) , creating a “ guest star ” in the sky that appeared brighter than Venus and lasted for over two years .
The supernova , now cataloged at SN 1006 , occurred about 7,000 light years away and has left a large remnant that continues to expand and fade today .
Pictured above is a small part of that expanding supernova remnant dominated by a thin and outwardly moving shock front that heats and ionizes surrounding ambient gas .
SN 1006 now has a diameter of nearly 60 light years .
Within the past year , an even more powerful explosion occurred far across the universe that was visible to modern humans , without any optical aid , for a few seconds .
W5 : Pillars of Star Creation
How do stars form ?
A study of star forming region W5 by the sun-orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope provides clear clues by recording that massive stars near the center of empty cavities are older than stars near the edges .
A likely reason for this is that the older stars in the center are actually triggering the formation of the younger edge stars .
The triggered star formation occurs when hot outflowing gas compresses cooler gas into knots dense enough to gravitationally contract into stars .
Spectacular pillars , left slowly evaporating from the hot outflowing gas , provide further visual clues .
In the above scientifically - colored infrared image , red indicates heated dust , while white and green indicate particularly dense gas clouds .
W5 is also known as IC 1848 , and together with IC 1805 form a complex region of star formation popularly dubbed the Heart and Soul Nebulas .
The above image highlights a part of W5 spanning about 2,000 light years that is rich in star forming pillars .
W5 lies about 6,500 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia .
MACSJ0025 : Two Giant Galaxy Clusters Collide
What happens when two of the largest objects in the universe collide ?
No one was quite sure , but the answer is giving clues to the nature of mysterious dark matter .
In the case of MACSJ0025.4-1222 , two huge clusters of galaxies have been found slowly colliding over hundreds of millions of years , and the result has been imaged by both the Hubble Space Telescope in visible light and the Chandra Space Telescope in X - ray light .
Once the above visible image was recorded , the location and gravitational lens distortions of more distant galaxies by the newly combined galaxy cluster allowed astronomers to computationally determine what happened to the clusters ’ dark matter .
The result indicates that this huge collision has caused the dark matter in the clusters to become partly separated from the normal matter , confirming earlier speculation .
In the above combined image , dark matter is shown as the diffuse purple hue , while a smoothed depiction of the X - ray hot normal matter is shown in pink .
MACSJ0025 contains hundreds of galaxies , spans about three million light years , and lies nearly six billion light years away ( redshift 0.59 ) toward the constellation of Monster Whale ( Cetus ) .
The Case of the Very Dusty Binary Star
For astronomers , close binary star system BD+20 307 originally stood out because it is extremely dusty .
A substantial amount of warm dust surrounding it causes the system to appear exceptionally bright at infrared wavelengths .
Of course , dust associated with planet formation is often detected around young stars , stars only a few million years old .
But the BD+20 307 system has now been found to be at least a few billion years old , an age comparable to the age of our own Solar System .
The large amount of warm dust is likely the debris from a relatively recent collision of planet - sized objects on the scale of , say , Earth and Venus , in the BD +20 307 system .
Reminiscent of the classic scifi novel When Worlds Collide , the dramatic illustration offers a depiction of the catastrophic event .
Ironically , this indirect evidence of a destructive planetary collision could also be the first indication that planetary systems can form around close binary stars .
BD+20 307 is about 300 light - years distant toward the headstrong constellation Aries .
A True Image from False Kiva
Is there any place in the world you could see a sight like this ?
Yes !
This digital mosaic shows the night sky as seen from False Kiva in Canyonlands National Park , eastern Utah , USA .
Diving into the Earth far in the distance is part of the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy .
Much closer , the planet Jupiter is visible as the bright point just to band ’s left .
Closer still are the park ’s picturesque buttes and mesas lit by a crescent moon .
In the foreground is the cave housing a stone circle of unknown origin named False Kiva .
The cave itself was briefly lit by flashlight during the exposure .
Astrophotographer Wally Pacholka reports that getting to the cave was no easy trek .
Also , mountain lions were a concern while waiting alone in the dark to record the mosaic .
Young Suns of NGC 7129
Young suns still lie within dusty NGC 7129 , some 3,000 light - years away toward the royal constellation Cepheus .
While these stars are at a relatively tender age , only about a million years old , it is likely that our own Sun formed in a similar stellar nursery some five billion years ago .
Most noticeable in the striking image are the lovely bluish dust clouds that reflect the youthful starlight , but the smaller , deep red crescent shapes are also markers of energetic , young stellar objects .
Known as Herbig - Haro objects , their shape and color is characteristic of glowing hydrogen gas shocked by jets streaming away from newborn stars .
Ultimately the natal gas and dust in the region will be dispersed , the stars drifting apart as the loose cluster orbits the center of the Galaxy .
At the estimated distance of NGC 7129 , this telescopic view spans about 40 light - years .
Irregular Galaxy NGC 55
Irregular galaxy NGC 55 is thought to be similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) .
But while the LMC is about 180,000 light - years away and is a well known satellite of our own Milky Way Galaxy , NGC 55 is more like 6 million light - years distant and is a member of the Sculptor Galaxy Group .
Classified as an irregular galaxy , in deep exposures the LMC itself resembles a barred disk galaxy .
However , spanning about 50,000 light - years , NGC 55 is seen nearly edge - on , presenting a flattened , narrow profile in contrast with our face - on view of the LMC .
Just as large star forming regions create emission nebulae in the LMC , NGC 55 is also seen to be producing new stars .
This gorgeous galaxy portrait highlights a bright core , telltale pinkish emission regions , and young blue star clusters in NGC 55 .
A Dark Pulsar in CTA 1
Where ’s the pulsar ?
Previously , the nebula CTA 1 showed an expanding supernova remnant , a jet , and a point source expected to be a pulsar — a rotating neutron star producing pulses at radio energies .
But no radio pulses were detected .
Now NASA ’s recently deployed Fermi Space Telescope has solved the mystery with some of its initial observations indicating that the point source is pulsing at gamma-ray energies .
The strange source is the first of a class that might be dubbed “ dark pulsars ” , rotating neutron stars that appear to pulse only in high - energy radiations .
Such pulsars might not be detectable in radio or visible light if they emit those radiations into a narrow beam not seen from Earth .
If true , our Galaxy might have more pulsars left for Fermi to discover .
Studying the gamma-ray properties of pulsars gives valuable clues to physics of the emission regions on neutron stars .
In this graphic , the pulsar ’s position is indicated in the wider CTA 1 supernova remnant .
An artist ’s illustration of the pulsar beaming at gamma-ray energies is shown in the inset .
Great Orion Nebulae
The Great Nebula in Orion , also known as M42 , is one of the most famous nebulae in the sky .
The star forming region ’s glowing gas clouds and hot young stars are on the right in this sharp and colorful two frame mosaic that includes the smaller nebula M43 near center and dusty , bluish reflection nebulae NGC 1977 and friends on the left .
Located at the edge of an otherwise invisible giant molecular cloud complex , these eye - catching nebulae represent only a small fraction of this galactic neighborhood ’s wealth of interstellar material .
Within the well - studied stellar nursery , astronomers have also identified what appear to be numerous infant solar systems .
The gorgeous skyscape spans nearly two degrees or about 45 light - years at the Orion Nebula ’s estimated distance of 1,500 light - years .
Haunting the Cepheus Flare
Spooky shapes seem to haunt this starry expanse , drifting through the night in the royal constellation Cepheus .
Of course , the shapes are cosmic dust clouds faintly visible in dimly reflected starlight .
Far from your own neighborhood on planet Earth , they lurk at the edge of the Cepheus Flare molecular cloud complex some 1,200 light - years away .
Over 2 light - years across and brighter than the other ghostly apparitions , the nebula known as Sh2 - 136 near the center of the field is even seen in infrared light .
Also cataloged as Bok globule CB230 , the core of that cloud is collapsing and is likely a binary star system in the early stages of formation .
A Spectre in the Eastern Veil
Menacing flying forms and garish colors are a mark of the Halloween season .
They also stand out in this cosmic close - up of the eastern Veil Nebula .
The Veil Nebula itself is a large supernova remnant , the expanding debris cloud from the death explosion of a massive star .
While the Veil is roughly circular in shape covering nearly 3 degrees on the sky in the constellation Cygnus , this portion of the eastern Veil spans only 1/2 degree , about the apparent size of the Moon .
That translates to 12 light - years at the Veil ’s estimated distance of 1,400 light - years from planet Earth .
In this composite of image data recorded through narrow band filters , emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red with strong emission from oxygen atoms in greenish hues .
In the western part of the Veil lies another seasonal apparition , the Witch ’s Broom .
On the Trail of 2008 TC3
On October 7 , the early dawn over northern Sudan revealed this twisted , high altitude trail .
Captured in a video frame , the long - lasting persistent train is from the impact of a small asteroid cataloged as 2008 TC3 .
That event was remarkable because it was the first time an asteroid was detected in space before crashing into planet Earth ’s atmosphere .
In fact , after astronomers discovered 2008 TC3 , the time and location of its impact were predicted based on follow - up observations .
Later , the impact predictions were confirmed by sensors , including a Meteosat - 8 image of a bright flash in the atmosphere .
Astronomers are now hoping for more reports of local ground - based observations of what must have been a brilliant meteor streaking through Sudan ’s night sky .
Additional reports could improve the chances of recovering meteorites .

HARBIN , China
- The northern city of Harbin , China , often referred to as China ’s freezing city has built what is said to be the world ’s largest Santa ice sculpture ever .
The sculpture was carved for the 25th Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival which was held on December 24 , 2008 .
The “ Father Christmas ” sculpture is 525 feet long and 24 meters high .
It ’s detail is amazing .
Warmer than usual temperatures have made it more challenging to carve the structure .
Tang Guangjun spoke with Reuters Television and he told them ” Its huge size and unseasonably warm temperatures have made the job especially challenging .
It is even bigger and higher than last year ’s , and more difficult .
The weather swings between warm and cold , so it becomes very wet and slippery on the ice .
It is very dangerous for us . ”

To start , in jQuery 1.3 event object has been normalized and wrapped into jQuery .
Event object .
As it says in the documentation : " The event object is guaranteed to be passed to the event handler ( no checks for window. event required ) . "
Here is an jQuery .
Event object overview :
Attributes event.type event.target event.relatedTarget event.currentTarget event.pageX/Y event.result event.timeStamp
Methods event.preventDefault( ) event.isDefaultPrevented ( ) event.stopPropagation ( ) event.isPropagationStopped ( ) event.stopImmediatePropagation ( ) event.isImmediatePropagationStopped ( )
Now , how to work with jQuery .
Event object ?
Anonymous functions that were bind to your elements will receive this new ( jQuery .
Event ) event object and can utilize it's new attributes and methods .
So your previous code will work fine ( most of the time :) ) .
$ ( " a " ).click ( function ( event ) { alert ( event.type ) ; } ) ;
The fun part starts when you trigger events with jQuery .
Event .
You can create new jQuery .
Event object and give it to the trigger ( ) 'er to trigger that event .
Example :
// Create new event object // the " new " is optional var e = jQuery .
Event ( " click " ) ; //
Add additional data to pass e.user = " foo " ; e.pass = " bar " ; // Call your event $ ( " a " ) .trigger (e ) ;
NOTE :
You do n't have to use new to create a new jQuery .
Event object .
It is optional .
Alternative way to pass data through event object :
$ ( " a " ) . trigger ( { type : " click " , user : " username " , pass : " password " } ) ;

I met MySQL founder Monty Widenius last year in Portland and he was n't particularly thrilled with Sun at the time - he was however publicly hopeful that things would improve for him .
Apparently they did n't .
Widenius has now officially resigned from Sun .
Widenius has now set up a new company called Monty Program AB .
His new company so far has a basic MediaWiki - based wiki that clearly indicates he intends to keep working on MySQL database elements , specifically the Maria engine -- albeit outside of the confines of Sun Microsystems .
Widenius was livid about the way that the MySQL 5.1 release happened which he thought was incomplete and loaded with bugs .
Sun countered that Widenuis was entitled to his opinion , but in its view MySQL 5.1 was a solid release .
" The main reason for leaving was that I am not satisfied with the way the MySQL server has been developed , " Widenius blogged .
He added that he parted on good terms with Sun and he expects to continue to do business and work together with Sun .
In parting , Widenius had kind words for Sun which in part were a faint echo of things he said last year during a keynote at OSCON .
" I still think that Sun was the best possible buyer for MySQL and I feel
sad that things did n't work out together .
Sun has a lot of good things
going on and I hope that they will continue their path to create and
promote Open source .
I will be available for Sun in helping them with
their goals in the open source space , " Widenius wrote .
So now instead of working inside of Sun on MySQL , Widenius will try and make a go of it outside of Sun working on MySQL .
The Maria engine is not intended to be a fork of MySQL according to Widenius .
It will be interesting to see how this works out over time .
Certainly MySQL , as a database , is a modular platform and it's all open source , giving tremendous extensibility .
Between Brian Aker 's Drizzle pulling MySQL one way and now Maria going the other , let 's just hope for MySQL 's sake that all this activity does n't ultimately end up in three separate forks of the same database .

So , let ’s keep this short and simple .
Tomorrow and Thursday the Coroners and Justice Bill enters its committee stage where two days are set aside to take evidence from all relevant parties and whittle the bill down to something that is likely to be sailed through the third reading stage .
Fat chance , then , that we can expect any significant changes or removal of the absolutely awful changes to the data protection act ; this is why it is extremely important that you keep writing to your MP ( it ’s a simple online form , takes 5 minutes ) and tell them that you oppose any introduction of sections 152 - 154 of the Coroners and Justice bill .
For those that have n’t been following this , sections 152 - 154 allow any government minister , to allow the sharing of any personal information to whoever they wish .
They can sell our data to foreign companies and governments , they can allow our tax and medical records to be accessible to whoever wishes to see them , they can even theoretically stop the press from publishing information about an individual .
How can they do this ?
Sections 152-154 allow not only any government minister to share data , but to rewrite any law that exists to facilitate what they want to do for the purposes of sharing that data .
More ambiguously they can also create new offences based on the data being shared of which there are no safeguards to ensure that retrospective charging of an offence can’t happen .
These 3 simple sections allow the government to throw away the data protection act , they allow the government to rewrite any law without more than a trivial vote on a statutory instrument ( of which none have been voted against since at least the 1970’s ) , and they allow
Do n’t let arguments that try to suggest the Government would never do anything bad with our personal information , or that even suggest this will enable the government to make our lives easier , fool you .
Through all the good intentions in the world , this bill is so loosely worded that even if Labour did not abuse it until the end of their time in Government , it would only take an unscrupulous government with a fair majority to use it in the worst ways imaginable .
Write to your MP , urge them to lobby the MPs in the committee stage to remove sections 152 - 154 , and to vote for any amendment at the third reading that does the same .
The bill , otherwise , satisfies too many “ good points ” to stop Labour MPs from voting tribally to push it through regardless of if this abomination on our rights remains in it or not .
How to turn doctors into sheeple
Communism is alive and well in America 's health care system
( Natural News )
The new $ 800 billion economic stimulus bill contains some striking new " Big Brother " health care language that should give pause to all freedom - loving Americans .
For starters , the bill requires the electronic tracking of the medical records of all Americans .
All your private medical data will be stored in a government database , including your history of disease , pharmaceutical treatments , surgeries and even emergency room visits .
How would you like the government knowing all the details about your drug rehab ?
Or alcoholism treatments ?
Abortion ?
Sexually - transmitted disease diagnosis ?
Pregnancy status ?
Blood test results ?
But it gets even more interesting than that :
Under the new provisions found in the bill , This news should rock the medical world ( once they truly understand it ) .
It means doctors can no longer make their own decisions about patients ' needs or treatment protocols .
From now on , all health care decisions will be centrally planned by a dictatorial , Big Brother health care authority in the federal government .
As Bloomberg.com reports ( http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601... ) , Tom Daschle was one of the architects of this plan , and he says that doctors " have to learn to operate less like solo practitioners .
" Any doctor that deviates from that plan would be penalized by the government .
That means , for example , that a local doctor who knows the patient and his family , and who is aware of specific local circumstances affecting that patient will no longer be able to apply any of that knowledge in treating the patient .
All treatments will be dictated from the government , obliterating the whole point of allowing doctors to operate with some degree of autonomy in the first place .
Effectively , .
It wipes out the intelligence of a local doctor and replaces it with the stupidity of Big Government .
If the government says all expectant mothers must be screened for depression and put on antidepressant drugs , then all the doctors have to play along and do that if they do n't want to be fined or have their medical licenses taken away .
If the government says nutritional supplements are dangerous and cannot be recommended to patients , then all doctors must remain silent and avoid telling patients the truth about helpful nutritional supplements .
Whatever the government dictates must now be mirrored by all practicing doctors .
And do n't forget :
The U.S. government is largely controlled by the pharmaceutical companies , and that means these health care dictates are almost certain to emphasize pharmaceutical treatments , disease " screening " and disease mongering provisions designed to sell more drugs .
You can count on there being increased requirements for vaccinations ( HPV vaccines , too ) and mental health screenings ( psychiatric drugs , anyone ? ) .
Americans asked for health care , but what they got was .
There is absolutely no reason to believe that a centrally - controlled government body has any ability to make good health care decisions for individual patients across America .
There is also no reason to believe the U.S. government will safeguard patient medical data or even respect the privacy of patients .
This is the same government , after all , that has been caught routinelyby tapping phone lines , emails , faxes and internet traffic .
If anything , the U.S. government has proven itself over the past few years to be .
Just look at the actions of the FDA in censoring nutritional supplement health claims ( https://www.naturalnews.com/019366.html ) , or the FTC in assaulting herbal product companies ( https://www.naturalnews.com/025303.html ) .
This government is clearly dead set against health care in America , and the more we put government in charge of making health care decisions , the worse the outcome is going to be .
Obama cried " catastrophe " in urging lawmakers to pass this economic stimulus bill .
It 's funny how fear is now being used to pass every trillion - dollar spending scandal in Washington these days .
That 's one thing the government learned very well from 9/11 -.
And it sold Congress on this stimulus bill , too .
But in terms of health care , the only thing this bill is going to stimulate is more disease , more dead Americans and more profits for Big Pharma .
There 's nothing in the bill about ending FDA censorship , or teaching the public about nutrition , or banning pharmaceutical advertising on television .
All this bill has accomplished is to spend Americans ever more quickly into financial destitution and medical desperation .
It is one of the final nails in the coffin of American prosperity .
From now on , America will largely be defined by disease and debt , and the Obama administration apparently has no answer to either one .
Watch out , folks .
The government is here to save us .
If you 're looking for REAL solutions , stay tuned to NaturalNews.com .
We are only a few days away from launching our new health freedom petition which demands real health care reform and an end to the dark era of Big Pharma domination over health care .
That petition will be announced right here on NaturalNews .

Coleman is holding up the seating of the duly elected Senator by contested the highly fair and transparent recount ( even your fascist party agrees it was fair and transparent ) with a very embarrassing lawsuit which includes doctored evidence ( which was thrown out ) , and witness testimony which not only does not support Coleman 's contentions , but proves that his contentions are hogwash .
Coleman picked these witnesses .
You are defending the indefensible .
Coleman 's case is untenable [... ] .
Go back to the free fascist republic , you are out of your league here .
I hope you are happy with the doubling of the national debt under the term of der Furher George W. Bush the war criminal .
We could fund the economic stimulus package using just what Halliburton stole from us over the past 6 years .

I meant it towards Democrats in general but there was NOTHING personal about that .
It was quite clear in your post ( # 19 ) , that your disinformative post was referring to the Franken / Coleman race .
If you 're really hoping to play the cry baby and see your posts removed eventually , please continue insulting my intelligence .
I have read long and hard about the Franken Coleman contest .
Fine .
Which is why I did n't remove your post without giving you a warning first .
If you have any evidence to support your claim that the Dem " strategy " was to " cherry pick Democrat districts , etc. " please let me know , otherwise , such claims will now be considered as pure disinformation .
HINT : Debunked , propagandastic posts without evidence from the discredited Powerline whackos does n't count as " evidence " .
Powerline posts about the contest are far superior to yours .
Other than them having been debunked and discredited .
Constantly .
On this matter and hundreds of others .
But other than that , yeah , they 're great !
I know that the Democrats want to count the vote ( until they have more ) and never want to count them properly .
I know that Democrats never accept a vote tally until they have won .
Evidence please .
Because my evidence ( see , for example , Bush / Kerry OH NM etal ' 04 , Bush / Gore FL ' 04 , Busby / Bilbray CA '06 , Madrid / Wilson NM ' 06 , Curtis / Feeney FL ' 06 , Jennings / Buchanan FL ' 06 , etc. ) shows quite the opposite , that Democrats ( unfortunately ) do n't want to count votes when they should .
As it turns out , neither do Republicans ( see all of those races listed above ) , so it works out great for both of them ... if not the actual voters .
I have seen it in Washington and in my home state .
Where Republicans claimed " fraud " but never actually presented any evidence for fraud ?
Oh , yeah , I remember that election .
I will always hold the belief that trying to recount ballots in one district that overwhemingly supports one candidate while not giving the same treatment to a district / county which doesnt support your candidate is an attempt to steal an election .
Um , and you claim you 've " read long and hard about the Franken Coleman contest " ??
You better get back to hitting the books , chief , because you would now be appearing to claim that Coleman is trying to " steal an election " .
Democrats failed to do it in 2000 and will fail in Coleman 's re-election .
Yeah , you have been reading Powerline .
Good luck with that , boss .
Just do n't post it here , unless you have actual evidence to back up your claim ( may be tough if you 're relying on the disinfo experts at Powerline though . )

Rounding rules of math are quite clear ; .5 and greater is rounded to the next highest whole number ( if a whole number is what is required ) and less than .5 is rounded down to the next whole number .
If 60 votes is still now required for cloture they must be using some of that Washington math none of us out here in the real world understand .

I 'm actually a very mellow Minnesotan about letting the process play out .
Each side has spent a bunch of millions and I expect no less than a bloody battle of the lawyers .
It was reported the other day that there were some military absentee ballots that were n't counted .
They might favor Franken this election , but let 's deal with that and everything else Coleman can throw up , because , really , work out the math on what percentage 200 votes is out of 2.5 million .
Not exactly a mandate for either of them so let 's make sure the process at least certifies a winner that Minnesotans can believe in .
Giving Franken a certificate now would be disastrous if Coleman won .
What would Congress do ?
Nullify any legislation that passed by one vote ?
I can't imagine any state judge or Minnesota politician wanting that mess pointing back to him , so I see Coleman getting every stall he can legally muster and that 's just the way the system works .
But as a strategy , sure , erect any available roadblocks to Gregg .
If there is one thing the Republicans should have taught us it's that playing dirty works .

BUENOS AIRES , Feb 26 ( Reuters ) - Argentina on Thursday blasted the head of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for saying the country , along with Ecuador and Venezuela , could be pushed into instability by the global economic crisis .
Lumping Argentina together with Ecuador and Venezuela , both led by leftist anti-Washington firebrands , raises concern in this country , where center - left President Cristina Kirchner is trying to keep the economy from stagnating .
Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana called the comments made on Wednesday by CIA Director Leon Panetta “ unfounded and irresponsible , especially from an agency that has a sad history of meddling in the affairs of countries in the region . ”
Taiana said he will meet on Friday with U.S. Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne to demand an explanation .

Peanut allergies can cause breathing problems A group of children with peanut allergies have had their condition effectively cured , doctors believe .
A team from Cambridge 's Addenbrooke 's Hospital exposed four children to peanuts over a six - month period , gradually building up their tolerance .
By the end the children were eating the equivalent of five peanuts a day .
It is the first time a food allergy has been desensitised in such a way , although a longer - term follow up is now needed to confirm the findings .
Peanut allergies affect one in 50 young people in the UK and commonly cause breathing problems .
But at their most serious , they can lead to a potentially life - threatening anaphylactic shock .
This could make a real difference
John Collard
Allergy UK
The Cambridge team started the children on tiny 5 mg daily doses of peanut flour before they trained their bodies up to cope regularly with 800 mg - the equivalent to five whole peanuts .
Kate Frost , the mother of a nine - year - old who was one of the four participants , said : " It 's very hard to describe how much of a difference it 's made - not just in Michael 's life , but for all of us .
" A peanut allergy affects the whole family .
You can't go out to a restaurant .
If your child goes to a birthday party , he takes a packed lunch . "

The concept of desensitising people to allergies has been successfully done with bee and wasp stings and pollen allergies , but this is the first time it has been achieved with a food - related allergy .
A few trials were done in the 1990s using peanut injections , but these were not successful .
' Quality of life ' Dr Andy Clark , who led the research published in the journal Allergy , said : " Every time people with a peanut allergy want something , they 're frightened that it might kill them .
" Our motivation was to find a treatment that would change that and give them the confidence to eat what they like .
It 's all about quality of life .
" It 's not a permanent cure , but as long as they go on taking a daily dose they should maintain their tolerance . "

The team have now expanded the study to include another 18 children and say there is no reason why the technique would not work for adults .
John Collard , the clinical director of Allergy UK , said it was " an important step forward " .
" This could make a real difference , but at this stage it is too early to tell whether it will work for everyone .
We need to see it used on more people and over a long period of time . "

You may be depressed by the amount of time your teenage couch potato spends in front of the TV , but according to a new study , all that television could increase his or her risk of becoming depressed as an adult .
Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and Harvard Medical School looked at the media habits of 4,142 healthy adolescents and calculated that each additional hour of TV watched per day boosted the odds of becoming depressed by 8 % .
Other forms of media , such as playing computer games and watching videos , did n’t affect the risk of depression , according to the study published today in the Archives of General Psychology .
The results do n’t prove that TV viewing itself causes depression , said Dr. Brian Primack of the University of Pittsburgh ’s Center for Research on Health Care , who led the study .
“ It could be argued that people with the predilection for later development of depression also happen to have a predilection for watching lots of TV , ” he said .

But the circumstantial evidence pointing to TV as the culprit is strong , the study found .
The researchers examined data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health , which followed a representative sample of American teens for seven years .
When the subjects were initially surveyed in 1995 , as junior high and high school students , they watched TV for an average of 2.3 hours each day .
They also spent 37 minutes daily watching videocassettes , 25 minutes playing computer games and 2.3 hours listening to the radio .
In 2002 , when the participants were interviewed again in their 20s , 308 of them met the criteria for depression , the study found .
Teens who became depressed had watched 22 more minutes of TV each day , on average , compared with teens who did not .
That dose - response relationship suggests that the boob tube was at least partly to blame , said Primack , a family practice physician .
The researchers described several possible mechanisms that could be at play .
Perhaps TV watching cut into time that could have been spent on organized after - school activities and other pursuits thought to reduce the risk of depression .

TV watching also could have displaced sleep , which is important for cognitive and emotional growth .
The programs and ads teens watched may have made them feel inadequate and worthless , or they could have stirred feelings of anxiety and fear , all of which contribute to depression , researchers said .
Compared with other forms of media , TV may be particularly damaging because it is so time - consuming , all - absorbing and laden with ads .
If that ’s true , Primack said , today ’s teens could be even more vulnerable .
But Andrew Campbell , who studies media use and mental health at the University of Sydney in Australia , said disturbing images were more prevalent on TV now than in the mid-1990s , and viewers of all ages were probably more inured to them .
Thus , if disturbing images were causing the increased rates of depression observed in the study , the link should not be as strong today , he said .

There ’s recently been some interesting discussion on the internet about “ How many hours ” people are putting in each day , inspired by a Slashdot poll .
This can be a sensitive topic .
After all , everyone wants to do a good job , and the number of physical hours that you spend “ working ” is considered an objective measure of that .
In some cases , that measure is considered positive ( Fire people who are not workaholics , claimed Jason Calacanis before he changed his mind and toned it down to “ people who do n’t love their work ” ) or negative ( Fire the workaholics , responded the ever controversial 37 - signals blog ) .
When working in a self - employed , services job ( e.g. freelancing ) , the idea that hours matter is deeply ingrained , because hours are the measurable thing that we charge for ( even though what the client really cares about is getting the job done ) .
In regular jobs ” , hours are also important , because they are the basis of the long - term contract between employer and employee ( “ Your working hours are from 9 am to 6 pm on weekdays , excluding public holidays ” ) , and they are the first mechanism an employer will use to make sure you ’re working hard enough .
This is all very interesting from the point of view of a technology start - up , because when you run your own start - up , and you have no one to impress with your long working hours , you end up realising that hours are immaterial .
What matters is the quality of what you do , not how or when or for how long you do it .
And that quality is not correlated with how long you are sitting down and focusing on your immediate “ work tasks ” .
When we measure results instead of hours , something interesting happens : the distinction between work and not - work blurs away and vanishes , for two reasons .
First , clever ideas can make a huge difference to results , and ideas occur anywhere , at any time .
In fact , they ’re least likely to occur while sitting at a desk working .
Secondly , it soon becomes obvious that our actual output of things done is correlated far more to how we feel on the day than to how many hours we spend “ working ” .
The real measure of work is not hours – it ’s energy .
We all have a certain amount of energy each day , that can fluctuate depending the day , on our general level of fitness , nutrition , health , state of mind , etc .
Some activities ( such as going to the gym ) increase our daily pool of energy .
Others ( such as staying up all night or getting drunk every evening ) decrease our daily pool of energy .
Asking the wrong question can have very detrimental effects .
It forces our mind to focus on the wrong approach .
I do n’t get more done by sitting in front of my computer looking at work for an extra hour .
I get far more done by investing time to exercise regularly so that I feel energetic .
So the useful question is not “ how many hours do you work ? ” but “ how much energy do you put into your work ? ”
Other useful questions that come with it are :
How much of your daily energy do you spend increasing your total energy ?
Do you feel you spend enough ?
Do you feel you spend it on the right things ?
How much of your daily energy do you waste each day ?
How do you define waste ?
Is all that waste really unproductive or does it have some beneficial side - effects ?
Are those side - effects sufficient to justify spending that energy ?
Do you spend energy on things which actively hurt you ?
Has your daily energy increased or decreased in the last 6 months ?
year ?
5 years ?
Any of these questions is more worthwhile than “ How many hours do you work each day ? ”

As a child , Matt Aman grew up in the lush tropical lowland rain forest of Sumatra .
Tigers padded through the underbrush , rarely seen and silent as shadows .
" It made my skin prickle , " the indigenous leader recalled recently as he sat on the floor of a stick hut surrounded by fellow villagers .
" When I was young , it was easy to find the mouse deer , monitor lizard , and wild pigs , " Aman said .
The birds were majestic , too , he said , as he nodded and lit a cigarette .
They filled the forest with a chorus of coos and trills that woke the Kubu village every morning .
" We never hear those birds anymore , " Aman said .
It is easy to see why .
The storybook forest of his youth , the great green riot of reeds and vines , the cathedral - like thickets of fruit and hardwood trees — all of it is gone .
In its place , for mile after monotonous mile , is a rolling carpet of palm trees , not the kind that sway in the wind at Waikiki , but a shorter , pudgier variety — the oil palm — that like corn and soybeans is rapidly becoming one of the world 's major sources of biofuel .
Not long ago , biofuels were billed as a green dream come true , a way to burn less fossil fuel and shrink our carbon footprint .
But today , mounting evidence indicates that producing biofuels — particularly those derived from food crops such as corn and oil palm — may be doing considerably more harm to the planet than good , actually increasing greenhouse gas emissions and driving up food prices worldwide .
Some of the most devastating costs of the biofuel revolution are on display in Indonesia , where massive clearing of tropical forests for oil palm plantations has caused staggering environmental damage and tremendous loss of biodiversity .
Only the Amazon and Africa 's Congo basin harbor more tropical forests than Indonesia , but the reality today is that all three regions are seeing their rain forests disappear at an alarming rate .
And in the Amazon and Indonesia , growing world demand for food and biofuel is now driving much of the damage .
A flurry of scientific field work and environmental reports have linked the spread of oil palm plantations in Indonesia to the decimation of rain forests , increased conflict between logging and oil palm interests and rural and indigenous people , and massive CO2 emissions through logging , burning , and the draining of carbon - rich peat lands .
And most of the trouble , as I learned on a recent visit , is playing out in the Indonesian lowland rain forests on Sumatra and Borneo , an ecosystem long regarded as a global hotspot for rare and endemic species — but perhaps not for much longer .
Over the past three years , researchers with the Zoological Society of London have searched exhaustively for tigers , clouded leopards , and other rare mammals on oil palm plantations in Sumatra .
They have turned up next to nothing .
" Most endangered species were never detected , " they wrote in a report last year .
Initially , they found hope along the edges of plantations where , against all odds , some tigers — which have roamed the rain forest for millennia — managed to survive .
But even as their studies were underway , much of that land was also cleared , often illegally by settlers .
" If developed responsibly , oil palm should be able to provide economic growth and development without turning some of the earth 's most important tropical ecosystems into ecological deserts , " the researchers noted in the report .
But they added : " This is a big ' if . '
Achieving responsible development is a major challenge . "
Roughly the size of California , Sumatra is the sixth largest island in the world .
But it is home to fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers , down from around 1,000 in the 1980s .
Historical population figures are sketchy .
But the big cat is believed to have lost 80 percent of its natural habitat over the past century , reducing the tigers to scattered groups in increasingly beleaguered forest oases .
" The tiger is going to go extinct if we do n't do something , " a wildlife biologist named Sunarto told me in Pekanbaru , the steamy capital of Sumatra 's Riau province , a center of oil palm planting .
For his part , Sunarto is working to persuade oil palm managers to leave strategic corridors of forest around plantations untouched so the endangered big cats do not become genetically isolated .
But it 's a struggle .
Not long ago , he journeyed to a research site only to find the area cleared and burned to make way for an oil palm plantation .
" The trees are gone , " said Sunarto , who is working on a Ph.D. through Virginia Polytechnic Institute .
" The animals are gone .
There are many places like that . "
According to Indonesia 's own figures , 9.4 million acres of forest have been planted with oil palm since 1996 , an area larger than New Hampshire and Connecticut combined .
That works out to 2,000 acres a day , or about one football field a minute .
Indonesia is the Kuwait of palm oil .
Only Malaysia , which has less at stake biologically , produces more .
" This is n't mowing your lawn or putting up a factory on the outskirts of town , " said Stephen Brend , a zoologist and field conservationist with the London - based Orangutan Foundation .
" It 's changing everything as far as the eye can see . "
Like tigers , orangutans — which are found only in Sumatra and Borneo — are also being nudged into increasingly isolated population units by rain forest destruction .
Their numbers are dropping , too .
But because there are more of them — between 45,000 and 69,000 in Borneo and 7,300 in Sumatra — extinction is not an imminent threat .
" They are still going to be in the wild , but in fragmented populations that can never meet , " Brend told me one evening .
" And if it 's reduced to that , we 've just lost everything .
It 's not only the orangutans .
It 's what you lose alongside them — the birds , insects , pollinators , all the environmental services that forests give , as well as a thing of beauty . "
Indonesia has long been known for its heavy - handed logging and plantation clearing .
Rain forests fall faster in Indonesia , in fact , than almost anywhere else on earth .
But Riaz Saehu , a spokesman for the Indonesia Embassy in Washington , D.C. , told me that under the country 's new president , Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , who took power in October 2004 , the era of widespread clearing for oil palm may be coming to a close .
" There is an effort to reduce plantation expansion , " Saehu said .
" What we do now is basically to promote sustainability . "
Many scientists are skeptical .
" After 23 years there , I must say they can talk the talk but never walk the walk , " Lisa Curran , director of Yale University 's Tropical Resources Institute , told me in an e-mail .
" The richest folks in Indonesia are owners of these oil palm plantations , so the corruption and patronage are linked to the very top of the food chain and power structures . "
In 2006 , Curran was awarded a so - called MacArthur genius award for her work on deforestation in Indonesia .
" Oil palm is a disaster all the way around for biodiversity if converted from logged forest or peat swamp , " she said .
" Oil palm is fine if they actually put it on totally degraded lands – but they do n't . "
Even if new planting were stopped tomorrow , it would be too late for the Kubu people I met in Sumatra , whose once - rich rain forest pantry has been stripped bare by an oil palm plantation .
" I have lost my garden , " a Kubu woman named Anna told me .
" I cannot grow the rubber , bananas , chilies , and other things I need to feed my family . "
A plantation oil palm tree grew in her front yard .
Not long ago , Anna said , plantation workers even bulldozed Kubu homes to plant oil palm .
" We tried to stop them , " she said .
" We started crying .
But the man said , ' Keep quiet or I 'll take you to the police . ' "
In Jakarta , I told Art Klassen , regional director of the Tropical Forest Foundation — a science - based U.S. non-profit — about what I heard from the Kubu villagers .
He did not seem surprised .
Indigenous land claims " are not enshrined in any legal framework , " he said .
Oil palm , he continued , " occupies the land totally and squeezes out local populations .
They become marginalized .
They become slave workers for the oil palm industry basically .
There is no other economic opportunity for them .
That 's it .
End of story . "
But it 's not just tribal people and wildlife that are displaced by oil palm .
So , too , is the very atmospheric gas now at the center of the global warming debate : carbon dioxide .
All forests release CO2 when logged .
But Indonesia 's jungles and carbon - rich , peaty soils hemorrhage the stuff .
Last year , a World Bank report put the loss from deforestation at 2.6 billion tons a year , making the impoverished southeast Asian island nation the third largest source of CO2 on Earth , behind China and the United States .
The week I visited Sumatra , Greenpeace activists aboard the Rainbow Warrior were blockading a shipment of palm oil off its coast .
A banner tied to the ship 's mast read : " Palm Oil Kills Forests and Climate . "
Perhaps the right kind of biofuels can help slow carbon emissions .
But scientists say that by rushing into biofuel production in recent years , we failed to look ahead .
What would make the best biofuel ?
Switchgrass ?
Soybeans ?
Sunflower seeds ?
Algae ?
That 's open to debate , but one thing is certain : Raw materials for biofuels should not be grown on plantations hacked out of tropical forests that are home to the richest concentrations of plant , insect , bird , and animal species on the planet .

Note : I wrote this post 7 months ago while the recently acquired and shutdown Pownce was working on a music service .
As a big web - based music service user ( listening to The Hype Machine right now ) , I was interested in what Pownce had up their sleeve with this small project called Pownce .
FM .
Unfortunately , the public will never get to see this creation .
Now that Pownce has been shutdown ( see image below ) I am publishing this review as a piece of web history .
When Pownce launched public file sharing last week , they had the future in mind .
That future gets launched today and it's called Pownce .
FM .
It 's a Pownce companion website allowing you to easily browse , play and create playlists with " music on the internets , " specifically music files shared publicly on Pownce .
Public music files are automatically loaded into a public songs area where Pownce users can freely browse , play and download songs .
Being a music site advocate myself and frequent user of TheSixtyOne , TheFeelGood , PureVolume and others , I definitely think that Pownce .
FM is a worthy addition to that line up .
I like the variety of stuff I can find .
While those other sites seem to have a focus on indie artists or are just generally random , Pownce .
FM seems to be more rewarding .
I 've bumped into songs I 've heard of countless times but just could n't put my finger on .
Fortunately , the Pownce populace was able to share it and I was easily able to add it to my playlist and download it .
Audiophiles familiar with scrobbling songs to their Last .fm account will feel right at home with Pownce .
FM 's integration .
That kind of Last .fm integration is something I wish I saw more often on the web - based music services I frequent , now more often than my own iTunes collection .
As for how Pownce will deal with copyright violations and takedown notices , they stated that they will comply with the law as necessary .
Nothing surprising there as that seems to be the standard way for sites dealing user - submitted content to deal with such issues .
Feedback
While I am more than impressed with the utility of the site , there are a few usability ideas I 'd like to discuss .
I would consider allowing songs to play on a double - click - the play icon is too small and far off to the side to work with effectively .
Fitts 's law supports this .
Readability is sacrificed a bit with the low contrast in the song lists , especially on the darker even rows .
Perhaps the hover state could be a light green or have the colors invert similar to iTunes , along with pale zebra rows .
I also question the use of the add song to playlist popup pictured above .
There is such minimal dialog that it makes more sense to implement such a thing in a smaller JS tooltip - like window docked next to each " + " icon .
I had something in mind like the drop - down menu and arrows on Digg .
Thoughts
Many people write off Pownce as a Twitter clone with more features .
That 's simply not the case .
Pownce and Twitter run in different directions .
Twitter is about people saying what they 're doing now and other stuff , while Pownce aligns more with people sharing events and media .
With today 's launch of Pownce .
FM , the latter has really begun to shine .
Of course , feature - wise Pownce .
FM is just a start .
It 's pretty hard to find a particular song at the moment - you can either scrolling and look for it yourself or use a rudimentary search .
For it to compete with any dedicated music site it 's going to need a much better way of browsing through thousands of songs .
Organizing by genre is a way to start but I 'd like to see the ability to share user - created playlists publicly , similar to what can be done with iTunes and Muxtape .
I would also like to see a way to view songs by popularity / plays and recency , along with a shuffle mode available within playlists and genre views .
Is Pownce .
FM something you might use ?
It seems like a good way to scoop up new Pownce users interested in sharing / listening to music .
What web - based music services do you use ?
What is Mardi Gras ?
The observance of a " Carnival " ( aka Mardi Gras ) before the Lenten period ( a Christian symbolic penitence from Ash Wednesday to Easter ) is not new .
It originated in the middle of the second century in Rome when the Fast of the 40 days of Lent was preceded by a feast of several days during which time participants delivered themselves up to voluntary madness , put on masks , clothed themselves like spectres , gave themselves up to Bacchus and Venus and considered all pleasure allowable .
The name carnival is derived from the Latin Caro , Carnis , flesh , and vale , farewell ( according to Ducange , from the Latin denomination of the feasts of the Middle Ages , carnis levamen , solace of the flesh ) , because at that time people took leave of flesh .
The carnival of the modern world is nothing more or less than the Saturnalia of the Christian Romans who could not forget their pagan festivals .
From Rome , the celebration spread to other European countries and finally to America .
Carnival is still observed in many American cities but certainly not with the glamour and grandeur that is attendant to the New Orleans carnival which had its birth in 1827 , when a group of students , recently returned from school in Paris , donned strange costumes and danced their way through the streets .
The students got the idea for their Mardi Gras revelry from the celebrations they had experienced in Paris .
New Orleanians caught the enthusiasm of the youths and from 1827 to 1833 .
Mardi Gras each year saw more and more revelries , culminating in an annual Mardi Gras ball .
In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville , a rich plantation owner , solicited large amount to help finance an organized Mardi Gras celebration .
It was not until 1837 however , that the first Mardi Gras parade was staged .
The first description of a Mardi Gras parade is of a single float in 1839 which was a crude thing , but a great success .
It is reported that the float moved through the streets while the crowd roared hilariously .
Since then Mardi Gras in New Orleans has been a definite success .
It continued to grow , with additional organizations participating each year until the Carnival as we know it today was the result .
There is no celebration in the world which is as much misconstrued as the New Orleans Mardi Gras .
Laboring under a misconception , the vast majority of people outside of New Orleans believe that the New Orleans Mardi Gras is a celebration spreading over a period of a few days just before Ash Wednesday .
In reality the New Orleans carnival is similar to the Fasching of Germany which begins on the twelfth night after Christmas and continues until Shrove Tuesday .
The expression Mardi Gras is from the French , meaning Fat Tuesday . "

Would you buy an 80 GB PS3 for just $ 300 ?
Would a $ 100 price drop have swayed you to nab a PS3 in lieu of an Xbox 360 or Wii over the holidays ?
Does the prospect of $ 300 Blu - ray playback make you swoon even a little ?
Wedbush Morgan 's Michael Pachter gazes into his crystal ball and says a $ 100 drop will happen this April , a move that will allow sales of the device to " once again begin to grow . "
What 's more , he think Microsoft could drop the Xbox 360 Pro's price from $ 300 to $ 250 around E3 2009 this summer , helping stave off market contraction as the overall economy struggles to recover ( Pachter thinks concerns about waning consumer demand are " overblown " ) .
Do n't look for official confirmation on any of this , of course .
Confirming price drops four to six months out would be intermediary sales suicide .
That said , if Sony does drop the PS3's pricing to $ 300 and its notable 2009 exclusives , e.g. Killzone 2 , Heavy Rain , MAG , EyePet , Nobi Nobi Boy , God of War 3 , and the one I 'm most excited about , Uncharted 2 , turn out to be as good as we 're hoping , we could be having a very different discussion about console demographics this time next year .
Sitting on jQuery 's support mailing list I noticed that developers use jQuery with huge data sets and their code becomes very slow .
Examples would be generating very long tables with a lot of rows using AJAX to get JSON data .
Or iterating through a long ( very long ) list of data , etc .
So I compiled a list of 5 easy tips on how to improve your code performance while working with huge data sets in jQuery .
One of the biggest questions about Watchmen has been : will there be excessive slow - mo ?
And I think this new clip answers pretty conclusively .
Update :
There are more clips .
On the other hand , it 's nice to see superheroes actually saving people .
The clip - the first actual scene from the movie to be released - came out via the Sun newspaper .

Really , it does n’t get much simpler than that – Jason Mika and David Umlas create a percussive symphony of colorful flame , burning salt - laced propane in chrome and steel statuary .
The video does n’t do justice to how loud it actually is in person , I ’m sorry to say – but if it did , you would n’t be able to hear anything else in the video .
When asked why they would do this , the only answers were “ Because we can , ” and “ People cheer . ”
Once again , we do n’t want to get sued , so do n’t try this at home .
Of course , if everyone took that advice , then no one would ever do anything like this and thus would n’t have a video .

How to " Win " Arguments and Infuriate Opponents ( with examples ! )
Posted by Louis Brandy on 02 February 2009
Note :
This has absolutely nothing to do with programming or development but I just really wanted to write it .
I consider myself a well accomplished devil 's advocate .
I enjoy arguing .
I routinely take positions that I do n't even agree with just because the person who I 've decided to argue with is right , but for the wrong reasons .
My willingness to engage in argument ( especially when I 'm choosing the battles ) has given me an awesome repertoire of go - to moves that I 've learned from others .
I present to you the 10 concepts you must grasp to be an absolutely infuriating argument opponent , with examples from the absolute masters .
1. Sophistry
I am using a very narrow ( and perhaps the original ) definition of sophistry .
Sophistry is act of using an argument not to prove your position 's truth , but to persuade the crowd that it is true , regardless of its soundness .
So the first key step is that you must always imagine ( even if it 's not true ) that there is a crowd of people who will listen to this argument and vote after the fact to determine the winner .
It 's even better if you can actually gather that crowd ( that internet thing is great for this ) .
Sympathetic crowds are very powerful .
If you take nothing else from this , take this : appearing to be right is more important than actually being right .
From that little maxim , all else follows .
Use everything below for this singular purpose .
2. Shifting the Burden of Proof
Normally , the burden of proving a claim rests with the asserter .
Ignore that rule .
Start asserting things .
When the other person challenges , ask him to prove you wrong .
A word of caution : sophisticated debaters wo n't fall for this one .
If he can't or wo n't disprove you , claim victory .
Bonus tip : if you get called out for not proving assertions , flip it on him , and tell him he's not proven - his - assertions .
Even if he has .
Demand more proof ( and keep raising the bar ) !
The classic and obvious example is : " You ca n't disprove God . "
Or this guy ( warning : conspiracy theorist )
3. Proof by Overwhelming Gibberish
Now we flip it on our opponent and instead of proving our points we overwhelm him with evidence .
Our goal now is exhaustion .
This requires a bit of preparation and research , though , but it 's substantially more effective .
An excellent way to execute this fallacy is after compiling a large list of apparent problems in your opponent 's theories .
Present them all at once to anyone who wants to argue with you .
Demand the other person explain to you , right now , all 413 things you 've listed that are wrong with his theory .
Here 's the important part : even if someone is able to give a satisfactory answer to one item on your list , do n't remove it .
The list only grows one way .
You may need that item for the next guy .
4. Affirming the Consequent & Circular Reasoning
These are two different fallacies that end up looking very similar in practice .
Circular reasoning involves presupposing in some fashion that which you want to prove .
Affirming the consequent is a formal fallacy :
A implies B
B is true
Therefore , A is true
Virtually all conspiracy theories hinge upon circular reasoning and they are notoriously impossible to dislodge from people 's mind .
Affirming the consequent is sort of like convicting someone because of circumstantial evidence .
If A was guilty , then it 's highly likely he'd have no alibi , and so since he has no alibi , he must be guilty .
This is devilishly subtle when you pull it off correctly .
If you can master its use , you 'll be quite convincing .
5. Appeal to Intuition / Argument from Personal Incredulity
Their position is obviously wrong when you phrase it the right way and appeal to people 's gut instincts .
" But you know , if anybody wants to believe they 're the descendants of a primate , they 're welcome to do it . "
-- Mike Huckabee
Did we evolve from rocks ?
6. Appeal to Authority
Appealing to expert analysis is sound logic but can be cumbersome .
That would mean you 'd need to understand it .
It 's much less work , though , to just assert that Dr. X believes something is true , and therefore it must be .
This can be especially effective if he 's not even an expert !
By far the best example of an appeal to authority is : petitions or mass signatures .
You do n't need to go through all the trouble of presenting an argument .
Just collect names and credentials and then BAM !
Who can argue with that ?
9000 people with PhDs have signed my petition : global warming is n't true .
7. False Premise
Creating a logically sound argument based on a false presumption .
In other words : make up evidence !
Getting the facts correct is a necessary , but insufficient , condition for finding truth .
There are other subtler ways of introducing false premises than just making up evidence .
Presenting someone as an expert when they are n't is one way .
One of the most commonly used and most subtly false premise fallacies is to paraphrase a quote incorrectly .
The reason this is so incredibly effective is because it puts the onus on your opponent to disprove something that it 's incredibly unlikely for him to have ever heard before .
That 's just golden .
Bonus Tip :
When he asks you to back up your claim with some documentation , tell him that you can't believe he 's never heard of this before and that it 's clear he needs to do much more research to intelligently discuss this with you any further .
Yes , sure , eventually , he 'll realize you were lying , but not before you 've won the day .
8. Equivocation
The equivocation fallacy is really about preying on the poor precision in language .
Essentially , an equivocation fallacy means that you have shifted the definition of a word in the middle of an argument .
This is incredibly powerful in politics and other games where labeling things is effective .
The way it works is you use and re-use a particular label with strong connotations and defend the label by using a ' weaker ' definition of the word .
Think how this might work with the word " liar " , for example .
This is also an excellent fallacy for " hijacking " discussions that are n't going so well .
If you are losing , resorting to this fallacy can be used to change the subject of discussion to word definitions and other uninteresting nonsense .
Consider that as a route of last resort .
A more subtle way to use the fallacy is to convert mathematical or numerical ideas into qualitative and / or subjective ones .
Turn numbers into labels .
And then massage the " English " version .
" The towers fell at virtually at free - fall speed !
Newton 's laws tell us that means the building put up nearly no resistance ! " source -- warning : conspiracy theories
9. Strawman
A strawman is a phantom argument .
It is , in essence , arguing with a position your opponent does not hold .
This is most effective if the strawman position is subtly different from his actual position , but substantially easier to argue against .
The strawman is the queen - mother of politics because the two people are so rarely in the same place to correct their position .
Caricatures of political positions can last for years ( pro-life is anti-woman . anti-war is anti-soldier ) !
It 's much easier to win an argument if you 've invented the opponent .
A more subtle form of the argument is to attribute to your opponent things that his allies have said .
This often comes up in politics and other similar discussions with obvious " camps " .
If someone represents a " camp " in an argument , find the most glaringly awful things said by members of that camp , and attack those points .
Bonus tip :
If you ever feel like you are using , accuse your opponent of using a strawman .
Tell him he 's being intellectually dishonest .
It 's pretty much a get out of jail free card .
10 . Correlation implies Causation
The essential idea here is that because two events happen together , or two variables track together , that one must be the cause of the other .
This powerful cheating mechanism essentially allows you to take credit ( or assign blame ) in incredibly powerful ways .
SEOUL , South Korea
IN one of Sun Mu’s best - known paintings from his “ Happy Children ” series , uniformed North Korean kindergartners sing like birds huddled together on a clothesline , their beaming faces so alike they could be clones .
At the bottom of the posterlike image , a red slogan leaps out against a yellow background : “ We are all happy children ! ”
When Sun Mu , an artist from North Korea who uses a pseudonym for security reasons , first exhibited paintings like this in Seoul two years ago , the police showed up to investigate .
They had been tipped off by viewers who , missing the intended irony , were upset by what they took to be Communist propaganda — a possible crime under South Korea ’s national security laws .
After all , rapturously smiling child performers are a familiar feature of North Korean pageants , and the style mimics posters celebrating the North ’s authoritarian regime .
“ I ’m not pro-Communist , far from it , ” said Sun Mu , 36 , who fled North Korea in 1998 to escape famine and arrived in the South in 2001 .
“ When people look at my paintings , I hope they can hear the children asking , ‘ Do you really think we ’re happy ? ’ ”
Sun Mu , who was trained to create posters and murals for the Communist government , is the first defector from the North to have won fame as a painter in the South by applying that same propagandistic style to biting parodies of the North Korean regime .

i Tulip has since 1999 warned that in a protracted financial crisis the US , a net debtor , is vulnerable to withdrawal of foreign capital and capital flight , producing inflation and a severe economic contraction known in the economics literature as a Sudden Stop .
We called our theory Ka-Poom Theory .
It defines two distinct crisis periods .
One , a six to 12 month period of disinflation ( Ka ) that typically proceeds a sharp inflationary ( Poom ) period of repatriation of capital by foreign investors and capital flight by residents .
Repatriation and flight both cause and result from currency depreciation in a rapid , self - reinforcing process .
In light of recent events , a subscriber recently asked how a disinflationary � Ka� crisis period such as we are experiencing during this financial crisis can turn into an inflationary � Poom� as foreign investment dries up and capital flees .
In response , I provided the explanation below based on research I am doing for a book .
In light of today�s events , I thought I�d share it with readers generally .
Treasuries Lose Allure for Asia , Europe Investors
Sept. 24 ( Bloomberg ) -- Investors outside the U.S. , who own more than half of all Treasuries outstanding , say the government 's $ 700 billion plan to revive the banking system will diminish the appeal of the nation 's bonds .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's proposal , which seeks funds to rescue banks by purchasing devalued securities , would drive the country 's debt to more than 70 percent of gross domestic product .
The last time taxpayers owed as much was in 1954 , when the U.S. was paying down costs from World War II .
`` The image of U.S. Treasuries as a safe haven has been tainted by the ongoing financial debacle , '' said Kwag Dae Hwan , head of global investment in Seoul with South Korea 's $ 220 billion National Pension Fund , which holds about $ 14 billion of U.S. government debt .
``A big question mark hangs over whether the U.S. can deal with an unprecedented amount of debt .
That is unnerving all the investors , including me . ''
Stuck in the Debt Deflation Box
The US is in a tough spot .
If the Fed does not take drastic measures to at least try to get the US credit markets working again the US economy will continue to crash .
Foreign investors will pull out , and domestic investors will follow � or at least they 'll try .
On the other hand , if the Fed purchases all of the bad debt that is clogging up the credit markets , it dilutes the value of US treasury debt in the process , and as you can see from the Korean fund manager 's comments above , that can potentially lead to a crisis of its own .
In any case I am not confident that the bailout effort will succeed because the fundamental problem is not toxic debt but too much debt is owed against depreciating assets .
These debt deflation crises all end up in some kind of conundrum like this .
For a net creditor with a high savings rate like Japan the choice was between throwing the currency or the labor force under the bus .
They went with deflation and a strong yen .
Our latest analysis for subscribers US exchange rate and capital controls or bust ( $ ubscription ) includes research that shows that the yield of the 10 year Treasury bond may increase by 100 basis points for each year that net foreign purchases do not increase .
Of course if they were to sell , bond prices will fall more rapidly .
Capital takes off
I 've studied a dozen instances of capital flight .
The process varies case by case but can be generally outlined in this eight step process .
Keep in mind that this was written before the nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the Lehman Bros .
bankruptcy , the extension of government depositor insurance to money market accounts , and other recent events .
1 ) Build - up :
The antecedents for crisis may be too - much short term foreign debt relative to GDP , unsustainable fiscal deficits , insufficient foreign exchange reserves , or some other imbalance or vulnerability , or multiple issues .
A crisis occurs � a crash , such as our housing and securitized debt market crash starting in 2007 � and the economy turns down rapidly .
Defaults and bankruptcies begin , first as a few small companies and financial institutions but escalating in size and frequency over time .
2 ) Erosion : Confidence in the economy and financial markets gradually erodes over a period of a year or more .
There are bank and non -bank institution failures , some of which are handled badly by authorities , reducing faith in the ability of government institutions to manage the crisis .
Inflation and defaults are equally worrisome for a net debtor because these test the confidence of foreign creditors .
Wealth holders inside the country and out start to wonder whether the authorities have things under in control .
Sept. 18 , 2008 the Fed and Treasury bail out insurance giant AIG ( Bloomberg screen capture )
3 ) Pre-Flight : Crises become more frequent and severe , remedies increasingly drastic , with ever more heavy handed government intervention in what were formerly considered sacrosanct market institutions and processes .
Banks and other institutions fail .
There is talk of nationalization .
The pre-flight phase may last for several months to a year .
4 ) Preparation : Long before the event occurs that triggers capital flight , such as the Russian bond default , insiders prepare for a potential economic D - Day with strategies to preserve as much of their wealth as possible .
They set up foreign accounts and make ready to transfer funds at a moment 's notice .
They gradually liquidate bond , stock and other funds to move into their foreign accounts with a phone call � generally not in writing .
The preparation process can occur on and off for months or for as long as a year .
They may purchase stocks , sovereign bonds , and other assets denominated in other currencies , and take possession of the physical certificates .
I 've had conversations with fund managers who have clients who have been discussing the topic since the Q1 of this year .
5 ) Flight Crisis :
An event occurs , such as the Russian bond default , that causes the currency to fall in a wave of sales of assets .
Those not in - the - know panic and try to follow the prepared insiders out the door ; a disorderly expatriation of capital and repatriation of foreign capital begins .
In the case of past crises , the currency crashes as rubles or pesos or won are thrown onto the market as assets are converted to dollars or euros or yen en masse for deposit offshore .
This typically happens in a matter of days or weeks .
6 ) Emergency Mitigation :
As the crisis goes critical one day the government slams the door shut with capital controls , trapping foreign and domestic investors alike .
Malaysia did so in 1998 but Korea did not .
We explore the history of capital controls by the US and other countries to assess that risk and recommend steps to hedge the risk for subscribers in US exchange rate and capital controls or bust ( $ubscription ) .
7 ) Sudden Stop :
If the government does not exact capital controls and capital leaves en masse , credit contracts , interest rates rise , the currency falls , and economic output drops suddenly as businesses close and unemployment spikes .
In the case of Korea during the 1997 - 1998 currency crisis , for example , college students had to go home to their families in Seoul that year because the won did not cover the tuition .
City parks quickly filled with the unemployed when only months before unemployment was largely unknown .
The crisis is well documented in social and economic impact of Sudden Stop economic crises in South Korea and Argentina .
8 ) Recovery :
What happens next depends on the structure and state of the nation 's economy before the crisis .
Koreans , part of a culturally homogeneous and egalitarian society , quickly scraped together more than a billion dollars of jewelry , coins and other personal gold items to give to the government voluntarily to be melted down to shore up the central bank 's accounts , which combined with a massive loan from the IMF stabilized the currency and economy .
Korea , like Russia , had a strong basis for recovery .
Korea 's powerful industrial base , deep pool of household savings , strong work ethic , high education level , and group spirit combined with strong demand from the US and Europe enabled it to quickly rebuild .
When I was there only four years after the collapse it was as if nothing had happened , at least on the surface .
Korean friends tell me that scars remain , especially mistrust of the IMF .
Since then Korea and most Asian countries maintain at least a year 's foreign exchange reserves to defend against a future attacks on their currencies .
Paradoxically , the buildup of these reserves since 1998 contributed to the glut of foreign official capital inflows that the US has enjoyed .
Russia , aided by western oil companies , began to pump the oil that the inefficient Soviet system could not get out of the ground .
Ten years after its crisis Russia developed massive foreign reserves in excess of $ 600 billion .
Where are we ?
Keep in mind that the stages of the process are non-linear , and apply differently to a major economy like the US , with its debts denominated in its own currency and most of it long not short term , compared to the Korean and other cases mentioned .
Steps can revert from one back to another and forth again , for example between pre-flight and preparation phases .
However , these processes tend to escalate in a positive feedback loop of crisis and response .
At this point it is not clear to me how the US avoids either capital controls to avoid a Sudden Stop or takes the full capital flight trip and experiences a Sudden Stop .
Most economists reading will be taken aback by the suggestion that the US might be the victim of capital flight and a Sudden Stop .
The US has long been the recipient and beneficiary of flight capital as other nations experienced financial crisis .
But a world ordered by poor nations financing the rich with their " excess savings " is an environment where long standing beliefs can be turned upside down , and fast .
It remains to be seen what happens to the euro as the financial crisis spreads to Europe .
The dollar , at least temporarily , may benefit .
The US has averted a " Poom " event so far because foreign central banks stepped in to support our housing and treasury market in 2003 .
But the financial and economic crisis is intensifying ; counting on foreign governments to support the US throughout is an invitation to disaster .
One of these days one of our creditors , not all of whom get along with each other , may force the US to make an impossible decision between a political ally and high interest rates .
If that were to happen against the current background of global financial crisis , longstanding imbalances between the US and the rest of the world may re-balance in a hurry .
We explore the history of capital controls by the US and other countries to assess that risk and recommend steps to hedge the risk for subscribers in US exchange rate and capital controls or bust ( $ ubscription ) .
The ideal hedge does n't cost much to set up , so that if the crisis never develops to that stage you have not spent a lot of money for nothing .
Needless to say , the cost of not being hedged is enormous .
Just ask your average stock market investor who missed our Dec. 2007 notice that a Debt Deflation Bear Market awaited us in 2008 .

Introduction .
On June 28 , 2016 , the Chicago Department of Public Health ( CDPH ) received five reports of Shiga Toxin - producing Escherichia Coli ( STEC ) 1 through routine surveillance .
By June 29 , routine interviews conducted by the CDPH Communicable Disease ( CD ) Program revealed that three of the five cases reported consuming food items from Carbon ( Restaurant A ) within 2 - 3 days before illness onset .
That evening , three separate hospitals reported an increase in the number of patients that presented to the ED with complaints of diarrhea and had preliminary positive STEC diagnostic laboratory tests .
By July 1 , seven cases reported eating at Restaurant A prior to their illness onset .
Carbon Final Outbreak Summary – City of Chicago Dept. of Public Health
Restaurant .
Restaurant A has two Chicago locations , one on the south side and another on the west side of the city .
The restaurant is open 7 days a week and serves Mexican - style foods .
Both locations serve the same menu and use the same food suppliers .
The majority of food preparation is performed out of the south side location ; most food for the west side location is transported after preparation at the south side kitchen .
Catering is also available .
Overall , approximately 40 % of food orders are placed by phone or through online ordering websites ( i.e. GrubHub , Eat24 , etc. ) for delivery or pickup .
Catering and other delivery orders are prepared in the same kitchen and by the same staff as dine - in orders at both locations .
Staff members at each location reported regularly consuming restaurant food .
Epidemiological investigation .
Case finding was conducted through public messaging and disease surveillance .
On June 30 , 2016 , CDPH issued a health alert to all Chicago hospitals to notify them of the outbreak , to request prompt reporting of STEC cases , and to discourage use of antibiotics and encourage aggressive hydration if suspecting a diagnosis of STEC .
Concurrently , the Illinois Department of Public Health ( IDPH ) issued an alert via the Food borne Outbreak Network to state health departments to notify them of any STEC cases with travel to Chicago and mention of Restaurant A .
A standard questionnaire was created to collect information about signs and symptoms of illness , food consumption and other potential exposures occurring in the seven days prior to the case ’s onset of illness , and meal companions .
A case - control study was conducted to determine risk factors for infection with STEC .
Case definitions were in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists standards2 .
A confirmed case was defined as isolation of E. coli O157:H7 ( STEC ) from a clinical specimen in a person with illness onset between June 3 - July 23 , 2016 , with either reported exposure to Restaurant A or a pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) pattern indistinguishable from one of 14 patterns associated with the outbreak .
Confirmed cases with reported Restaurant A exposure and onset dates that preceded others within their household were considered confirmed primary cases .
A probable case was defined as a person with clinically compatible illness ( bloody diarrhea or ~3 days of diarrhea with ~ 3 stools in a 24 - hour period ) in the absence of laboratory confirmation , and exposure to Restaurant A or shared household with a primary case .
Secondary cases were defined as household contacts of primary confirmed or probable cases , with onset of diarrhea one to eight days after the primary case ’s symptom onset date .
Case - control analysis was limited to primary confirmed cases and well controls .
To identify controls , CD Program staff asked confirmed cases about their meal companions and obtained a list of individuals who placed orders through the online delivery service GrubHub .
Controls were frequency matched 4:1 to cases by meal date ( June 17th - June 30th ) and restaurant location .
Contingency tables were arranged to evaluate the bivariate relationships between case status and individual food items , and odds ratios ( OR ) with 95 % confidence intervals { 95 % Cl ) were estimated for each .
Chi-Square tests were performed to identify statistically significant associations , except when expected cell counts were less than or equal to 5 , in which case Fisher ’s Exact test was used .
P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
The independent effects of variables found to be significantly associated with disease in the bivariate analyses were further evaluated using multivariable logistic regression , adjusted for age and gender .
All statistical analyses were carried out with SAS version 9.3 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) .
Environmental investigation .
On July 1 , 2016 , the Food Protection Division ( FPD ) conducted an environmental inspection of Restaurant A and collected the following : food samples , initial information about restaurant employees and food preparation , and copies of invoices for food items .
Food items collected included steak , chicken , cilantro , elote ( corn ) , elote mix , cheese , sour cream , grilled corn & pineapple salsa , salsa fresca , tequila lime sauce , red and green salsas .
CD Program staff performed in depth interviews of the owners of the restaurant and employees .
Because employees at both locations often functioned in multiple roles , all on - site restaurant employees were considered food handlers for the purposes of this outbreak investigation .
Food handlers were asked to submit stool specimens to screen for STEC .
Laboratory investigation .
Clinical culture or polymerase chain reaction tests were performed by hospital and commercial laboratories and results were reported to the CD program .
Specimens from cases , food handlers , and food were sent to the Illinois Department of Public Health Division of Laboratories for culture , and for serotyping and PFGE analysis of STEC isolates .
PFGE patterns were uploaded to the national Pulse Net database and compared by the Centers of Disease Control ( CDC ) .
Sixteen isolates selected to represent all outbreak - associated PFGE patterns and a variety of source patients ( primary and secondary cases as well as food handlers ) , restaurant locations , and meal dates were sent to CDC for characterization by multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis ( MLVA ) .
Epidemiologic findings .
Sixty - nine confirmed and 37 probable cases were identified as part of this outbreak .
Among the confirmed , 55 met the primary case definition , four were secondary cases , and ten of the confirmed cases matched the outbreak PFGE pattern but their association with the restaurant was not identified ( five denied eating at the restaurant and five were unable to locate ) .
One additional case , identified after the restaurant closure and reopening , was unable to be classified due to multiple
Restaurant A meal dates and a PFGE pattern that was similar but not identical to other outbreak patterns .
Illness onset dates of the 55 confirmed primary cases ranged from June 19 - July 3 .
Median age was 29 years ( range , 3 to 69 years ) ; 29 ( 53 % ) of the cases were female .
Median incubation period was 3 days ( range 12 hours - 5 days ) .
Twenty - one primary and one secondary case were hospitalized .
No cases developed hemolytic uremic syndrome , and none died .
Among the 55 confirmed primary cases , 50 ( 91 % ) ate at the south side location ( meal date range 6/17 to 6/30 ) and 5 ( 9 % ) ate at the west side location ( meal date range 6/19 to 6/26 ) .
Multiple food items were associated with illness on bivariate analysis ( Table 1 ) including consumption of cilantro ( odds ratio [ OR ] 3.5 , 95 % Cl : 1.5 - 8.1 ) , salsa fresca ( OR 3.1 , 95 % Cl : 1.6-6.1 ) , chicken taco ( OR 3.1 , 95 % Cl : 1.6-6.0 ) , and lettuce ( OR 2.01 , 95 % Cl : 1.1 - 3.8 ) .
Multivariable analysis using logistic regression ( Table 2 ) revealed that consumption of cilantro ( adjusted OR [ aOR ] 4.64 , 95 % Cl : 1.87-12.011.6 ) , salsa fresca ( aOR 2.85 , 95 % Cl : 1.31-6.05.4 ) , and lettuce ( aOR 2.57 , 95 % Cl : 1.23 - 5.26 ) remained independently associated with illness after adjusting for age and gender .
The observed epidemiologic association with chicken tacos may reflect collinearity between chicken tacos and cilantro , meaning that an association was identified because the chicken tacos are prepared and served with raw cilantro .
All cases who reported eating a chicken taco also reported eating cilantro .
Other chicken - containing items ( e.g. , chicken burritos , chicken salad bowls ) were not associated with illness .
Because salsa fresca was known to contain raw cilantro , an additional multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed including a combined variable indicating consumption of either cilantro or salsa fresca .
In this model , consumption of cilantro or salsa fresca was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 6.9 [ Cl : 2.0-24.0 ]
Lettuce was associated with illness in both multivariable models but was consumed by only 44 % of cases .
In comparison , cilantro was consumed by 87 % of cases , and either cilantro or salsa fresca were consumed by 95 % of cases .
Environmental findings and food handler interviews .
Meats , salsas , and marinades were fully or partially prepared at the south side location and transported daily to the west side location .
Most fresh produce items , including cilantro and lettuce , were received by each location in separate deliveries and chopped and prepared on - site .
Several critical violations were identified during the sanitarians ’ inspection of Restaurant A on July 1 , including improper temperatures for several food items ( i.e. red & green salsas , tequila lime sauce , raw fish , guacamole , and cheese ) , and improper hand hygiene practices among food handlers .
Because of concern for a potential ongoing public health threat associated with food served by Restaurant A , CDPH recommended that the restaurant voluntarily cease operations and withdraw from a large outdoor food festival until more information about the source of the contamination was known .
The owner agreed , and Restaurant A voluntarily closed both locations .
CD staff subsequently interviewed and tested forty food handlers from both locations .
According to the restaurant owner , there was no cross-over of food handlers at the two locations .
Among the forty food handlers interviewed none reported any history of gastrointestinal illness in the two weeks preceding or during the outbreak period , though absenteeism was reported for one .
Nearly all food handlers had stool tests performed within one week after the restaurant closure .
Laboratory findings .
Specimens from 69 cases and 16/40 ( 40 % ) food handlers yielded STEC isolates .
From primary case isolates , 10 PFGE patterns were identified .
An additional four similar patterns were identified among food handler isolates .
The 16 isolates analyzed by MLVA displayed four unique MLVA patterns .
One predominant MLVA pattern was shared by 10 isolates .
Food handler and case isolates displayed a variety of MLVA patterns , with some food handlers sharing MVLA patterns indistinguishable from restaurant patrons despite differing PFGE patterns .
There were no distinct pattern groupings according to restaurant location .
None of the 12 food items cultured were positive for STEC .
Food product traceback .
In collaboration with CDPH , FPO and IDPH department of Food , Drugs and Dairy , invoices collected from the restaurant for the outbreak period meal dates were reviewed .
Cilantro was purchased from a distributor serving multiple other restaurants throughout Illinois .
The distributor repackaged cilantro from multiple sources , including suppliers in Mexico and Illinois .
Of the five laboratory - confirmed cases who denied Restaurant A exposure , none reported cilantro consumption , although cooperation with re-interview was limited .
In the absence of confirmed cases reporting consumption of implicated food items from another restaurant , it was not possible to perform further traceback to assess for a common source of contamination .
No other restaurants serviced by the distributor were linked to the outbreak .
Re-inspection and reopening .
FPO performed re-inspections at both locations , during which instruction and guidance were provided on hand hygiene and it was ensured that food preparation and storage areas were adequately sanitized .
Only food workers who had two consecutive negative tests for STEC were permitted to work at the reopened locations , which delayed reopening of the south side location .
After passing FPO re-inspections , the south and west side restaurants re-opened on July 9 and 29 , respectively .
An additional case of STEC was subsequently identified with a meal date of July 11 , 2016 at the reopened west side location , prompting imposed restriction of all food handlers who had been involved with preparation of the case ’s meal .
All of these food handlers and the case ’s meal companions were tested for STEC , with negative results .
The case had also eaten food from the restaurant on June 21 with a household member , prior to the restaurant ’s closing ; neither reported symptoms of illness at that time .
PFGE analysis revealed an additional pattern not previously identified in this outbreak , but which appeared related to other outbreak patterns .
Because of the multiple meal dates , negative test results of all meal companions and involved food handlers , and absence of additional reported restaurant - associated cases after the re-opening , we could not definitively determine if the case was primary , secondary or unrelated .
Food handlers were permitted to return to work after repeated negative test results .
No additional complaints were received in association with the restaurant in the two months following this case ’s illness onset
Conclusion .
This was a large restaurant - associated outbreak of Shiga toxin - producing E. coli O157:H7 infections .
Closure of the restaurant during the early stage of the investigation prevented additional cases of illness from occurring .
Cilantro was the most likely food - vehicle causing this outbreak , based on the strong statistical association of raw cilantro consumption with illness , and the high percentage of cases explained by cilantro consumption .
The large number of PFGE patterns associated with the outbreak was suggestive of a heavily contaminated food item rather than introduction from a point source such as an ill food worker at the restaurant .
However , STEC was not isolated from cilantro or cilantro - containing food items collected from the restaurant or the restaurant ’s distributor .
Inability to isolate STEC from food samples may have been hindered by imperfect sensitivity of testing , imperfect representativeness of food samples , or turnover of produce items through the distribution chain leading to items no longer being contaminated at the time of collection .
Additionally , cross-contamination during food preparation and transmission by food handlers who were found to have STEC infection likely contributed to the outbreak .
Move It To The Model and Use Tiny Methods
I ’m updating an application that I first wrote two years ago and last updated one year ago .
It has been amazing to see how much I have learned in the past two years .
One of the requirements of the application is for the users to update their information each year .
Just last year , I had code like this .
Before you look at the code below , I want to warn you that it is not for the faint of heart .
Never , ever do this .

|| current_user.zip.blank ? || updated_at.year != Time.now.year ) -%> <!-- show the update form --> <%- else -%> <!-- show the list of forms to be completed --> <%- end -%>
I would not lie to you .
It was literally like that .
A year later , I can barely tell what I was trying to do here .
Imagine someone who did n’t know the application inside and out trying to work with code like that .
Yikes !
Here is my refactored version , that is far more descriptive .
<%- if current_user.needs_to_update_information ? --%> <!-- show the update form --> <%- else -%> <!-- show the list of forms to be completed --> <%- end -%>
The benefit of this implementation is that any programmer can immediately tell what my intent is and that all the logic of determining whether or not the current user needs to update their information is moved to the model , where it belongs and can more easily be tested .
So what are the steps that I took to get to that new method ?
First , I changed the if statement to the one above and then I moved all the logic into the user model like this .
class User def needs_to_update_information ?
roles.select { |r| r.title.include ?(' Pastor ' ) }.size > 0 && ( email.blank ? || address .
blank ? || city .
blank ? || state .
blank ? || zip.blank ? || updated_at.year != Time.zone.now.year ) end end
This is only step 1 .
We are not done by any means .
I can assure you that if you leave a method like this in your code , I will verbally attack you if I come across it .
Let ’s break this method down a bit , starting with the first conditional .
roles.select { |r| r.title.include ?(' Pastor ' ) }.size >
0
This is horribly nondescript .
What is my intent ?
Only pastors need to update their information and that is what this conditional checks .
How about we add a pastor ?
method and use that in place .
Also , I tweaked the condition to use Enumerable ’s any ?
method ( as suggested by David ) .
class
User def needs_to_update_information ?
pastor ? && ( email .blank ? || address .
blank ? || city .
blank ? || state .
blank ? || zip.blank ? || updated_at.year != Time.zone.now.year ) end def pastor ?
roles.any ?
{ |r| r.title.include ?(' Pastor ' ) } end end
That is much better , but why stop there ?
The next chunk of code that I see that we can pull out is the address stuff .
address.blank ? || city .
blank ? || state .
blank ? || zip.blank ?
The intent of these conditionals is to make sure that the user ’s address is not blank , so I created an address_needs_updated ?
method .
class
User def needs_to_update_information ?
pastor ? && ( email .blank ? || address_needs_updated ? || updated_at.year != Time.zone.now.year ) end def pastor ?
roles.any ?
{ |r| r.title.include ?( ' Pastor ' ) } end def address_needs_updated ?
address.blank ? || city .
blank ? || state .
blank ? || zip.blank ?
end end
Next up , I addressed updated_at .
year != Time.zone.now.year .
The intent of this conditional is to see if the user ’s record has been updated in the current year .
I pulled this out into an updated_this_year ?
method .
class
User def needs_to_update_information ?
pastor ? && ( email .blank ? || address_needs_updated ? || !updated_this_year ? ) end def pastor ?
roles.any ?
{ |r| r.title.include ?( ' Pastor ' ) } end def address_needs_updated ?
address.blank ? || city .
blank ? || state .
blank ? || zip.blank ?
end def updated_this_year ?
updated_at.year == Time.zone.now .year end end
That is probably about as far as I would go with this .
So what are the benefits of all these changes ?
The Benefits
Moved business logic to the model where it is easier and more fun to test .
More descriptive as to the intent of what is happening .
Intent is really important .
It is far more important for someone to understand why you are doing something than how you are doing something .
There are many ways to do something , but there is only one intent .
you are doing something than you are doing something . .
Smaller methods are easier to test than larger ones ( and more fun ) .
Testing large methods feels burdensome and often does n’t provide enough coverage .
Did I mention testing ?
It is easier and more fun to test models than views and small methods than large methods ( yes , testing can be fun ) .
Getting back into this app , I learned that I have learned a lot in the past few years and I hope the error of my ways was beneficial for you too .
I am in no way a refactoring expert and have n’t read the book on it , but if you are curious about refactoring , the techniques I used above appear to be Decompose Conditional and Extract Method .
Note : I ’ve written two simple JavaScript refactoring articles over at Addicted To New .
The first is on introducing explaining variables and the second is on moving functions into an object .

DALLAS , Texas ( CNN ) --
The family of Timothy Cole , a Texas man who died in prison nearly a decade ago while serving a sentence for a rape he swore he did not commit , is hoping a court will issue the state 's first posthumous exoneration .
Timothy Cole died in prison while serving a sentence for a rape DNA tests show he did not commit .
Cole was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for the 1985 rape of 20 - year - old Michele Mallin .
He maintained his innocence , but it was not confirmed by DNA until years after his 1999 death , when another inmate confessed to the rape .
" Everybody thinks he died a felon , a hardened criminal , " Cole 's brother , Cory Session , told CNN .
" That 's what hurts . "
The court hearing on the exoneration began Thursday afternoon , according to the Austin American - Statesman .
Mallin , who has spoken publicly about the case , will join Cole 's family in the Austin , Texas , courtroom .
They want a judge to clear Cole 's name , according to the Innocence Project of Texas , a nonprofit organization that seeks to help the wrongfully convicted .
Among those expected to testify are Mallin and Jerry Wayne Johnson , her confessed rapist .
Watch Cole 's mother make emotional plea »
Then a student at Texas Tech University in Lubbock , Mallin was walking to her car , intending to move it to another parking lot , when a man approached her asking about jumper cables , she told CNN .
In a matter of seconds , he put her in a chokehold , a knife to her neck .
He forced himself into her car and drove her to the outskirts of town , where he raped her .
The next day , police investigators showed Mallin pictures of possible suspects .
She chose a picture of Cole and said he was her attacker .
She later identified him in a physical lineup , according to the Innocence Project of Texas .
" I was positive , " she told CNN .
" I really thought it was him . "
But there was one detail : Mallin told police her attacker was a smoker .
" He was smoking the entire time . "
And Cole , who suffered from severe asthma , " was never a smoker , " Session said .
" He took daily medications ( for asthma ) when he was younger . "
" He was the sacrificial lamb .
To them , my brother was the Tech rapist , there was no backtracking .
It was the trial of the decade for Lubbock . "
The " Tech rapist " attacked four women other than Mallin -- abducting them in parking lots near campus and driving them to a vacant location , where he would rape them and flee on foot , according to the Innocence Project of Texas .
The rapist " terrorized " the Texas Tech campus in the mid-1980s , the organization said .
Cole , like Mallin , was a student at Texas Tech .
He had finished two years of college previously and was returning to school after spending two years in the Army , his brother said .
But his dreams of getting married and having children never materialized .
He was arrested and charged with Mallin 's rape , declining a plea bargain offer that would have put him on probation .
A jury convicted him and imposed a 25 - year sentence .
That night , " he hugged my mother , and he said , ' Mother , why these people lie on me ?
Why they do this to me ? ' " Cole 's brother Reggie Session recounted for the Lubbock Avalanche - Journal , which published a three - part series on the case in June .
" He said , ' They know I ai n't done nothing to that girl .
I do n't even know that girl .
Why they do this to me , mother ? ' ...
He cried in my mother 's arms on the floor . "
Later , while in prison , Cole rejected an offer of parole that would have required him to admit his guilt .
" His greatest wish was to be exonerated and completely vindicated , " his mother , Ruby Session , told CNN affiliate News 8 Austin .
But the asthma that plagued Cole throughout his life brought about his death on December 2 , 1999 .
The cause was determined to be heart complications due to his asthmatic condition .
He was 39 .
It was 2007 when a letter addressed to Cole arrived at his family 's home , written by Johnson .
Read the letter »
" You may recall my name from your 1986 rape trial in Lubbock , " says the letter , dated May 11 , 2007 .
" Your Lubbock attorney , Mike Brown , tried to show I committed the rape .
" I have been trying to locate you since 1995 to tell you I wish to confess I did in fact commit the rape Lubbock wrongly convicted you of .
It is very possible that through a written confession from me and DNA testing , you can finally have your name cleared of the rape ... if this letter reaches you , please contact me by writing so that we can arrange to take the steps to get the process started .
Whatever it takes , I will do it . "
Johnson did not know Cole had died .
In fact , according to the Avalanche - Journal , he had been writing to court officials for years to confess to the rape , but got nowhere .
Upon finding out that Cole was dead , Johnson wrote he " cried and felt double guilty , even though I know the system 's at fault , " according to the Avalanche - Journal .
" A day later , I am still bothered , terribly , by the death revelation .
Because , not knowing Mr. Cole at all , I wonder if the wrongful incarceration contributed to his death . "
Johnson has been in prison since 1985 on two convictions for aggravated sexual assault , according to the Texas Department of Corrections .
He was given a life sentence for the rape of a 15 - year - old girl , and a jury later tacked on a 99 - year sentence for another rape , according to the Avalanche - Journal .
He cannot be charged with the Mallin case , as the statute of limitations has expired .
The Innocence Project became involved after Cole 's family received Johnson 's letter .
DNA tests confirmed that Johnson was Mallin 's attacker .
Now , Cole 's family hopes the court hearing will be the final step in clearing his name .
Mallin is helping them .
" I was very traumatized , " she told CNN .
" I was scared for my life .
I tried my hardest to remember what he looked like .
" I 'm trying to get his name cleared .
It 's the right thing to do . "
Cory Session said , " We do n't blame Michele .
She 's very gracious . "

( CNN ) --
A possible merger between the two of the largest companies in the concert business has raised protests from singer Bruce Springsteen and prompted a congressman to call for a federal anti-trust investigation .
A possible merger between Ticketmaster and Live Nation has drawn interest .
Ticketmaster , which has long dominated ticket sales , is reportedly in merger talks with Live Nation , the world 's largest concert promoter , which just recently began selling its own tickets .
Live Nation did not respond to a CNN inquiry , while Ticketmaster 's spokesman said " we cannot comment on rumor or speculation . "
" Being two public companies , they can't really comment on it right now , but it seems very real to me , " said Ray Waddell , Billboard magazine 's concert tour reporter .
iReport :
What do you think of the possible merger ?
" You 're talking about a hugely powerful entity if these two combine forces , " Waddell said .
" They 're locking up a whole lot of the revenue streams for live music , and that is really the most consistent and profitable part of the music business right now . "
Ticketmaster , long a target of fan and artist criticism , drew Springsteen 's ire this week when it routed some of his fans trying to buy tickets to his show in New Jersey to a " secondary site " where they were charged far more than face value .
Tickets on that site -- which Ticketmaster owns -- cost between $ 200 and $ 5,000 , while face value starts at $ 54 .
Springsteen , in a message posted on his Web site , accused Ticketmaster of " in effect ' scalping ' " the tickets .
Ticketmaster CEO Irving Azoff apologized to Springsteen in a letter Wednesday , saying it would n't happen again .
New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell , who said he was " deluged this week by calls from angry music fans , " sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission chairman asking that the FTC look into Ticketmaster 's practices .
After reports that Ticketmaster and Live Nation might merge , Pascrell sent another letter to the House Judiciary Committee calling for a probe .
" There is an incredible potential for abuse when one company controls the primary and secondary market for concert tickets , " Pascrell wrote .
" That potential will surely be magnified exponentially should one company be able to control every aspect of recording , record sales , licensing , venue ownership and ticket sales . "
Springsteen 's
Web message asked his fans to " make it known to your representatives " if they opposed a merger .
" The one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system , thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing , " said the message , signed by Springsteen and his agent .
Waddell , who has covered the friction between Ticketmaster , artists and fans , said combining the two companies could mean some fan - friendly changes , including rolling all fees into one ticket price to eliminate " sticker shock " when fans look at their credit card bill .
Ticketmaster 's practice of stacking " convenience fees " onto purchases inflated ticket prices and drew fan resentment .
Ticketmaster pioneered online ticket sales , a modern convenience that did away with long lines at the box office .
" What Ticketmaster has done to ticketing , they 've really revolutionized it as far as the old days , when you had to camp out for a high - demand show , " Waddell said .
Waddell said he does n't expect ticket prices would " just blow up " after a merger .
" Traditionally , when there 's competition taken out of the marketplace it really does n't do a lot for lowering prices , but both these companies are very sensitive to the market and what the fans can pay , " he said .
A combined company , though , would control " everything before , during and after a concert takes place over the course of an entire tour , and that 's pretty sizable , " he said .

Did Mississippi help tire firm squeeze states for subsidies ?
Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday February 11 , 2009
Print This Email This When Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour signed into law last week a $ 19 million package of incentives designed to keep Cooper Tire from closing its Tupelo , Miss .
plant , he touted it as a victory for his state .
" People ask me all the time , ' What does the state do about job losses ? ' "
Barbour announced at the signing .
" Well , the first thing we do is we 've got to do is keep the jobs we 've got . "
Barbour 's job - retention strategy for Mississippi is in sharp contrast to President Barack Obama 's proposed stimulus plan , which Barbour has condemned on the grounds that it " includes excess spending and impedes states ' abilities to manage their own programs . "
Barbour has even indicated that he might refuse federal funds if they come with strings attached , to the dismay of many of his state 's own legislators .
However , the Cooper Tire deal appears questionable on a number of grounds beyond that of political ideology , with one blog even describing it as a form of extortion .
" In a grim variation of the subsidy game that may become more common in a tanking economy , " writes Clawback.org , " Cooper Tire last month successfully squeezed over $ 66 million in subsidies for plants in three states , pushed down union wages and benefits , and eliminated one plant altogether .
...
The real lesson is how easily Cooper Tire could compound the pain of a plant shutdown in one state by extracting wealth from workers and taxpayers in three others . "
Cooper Tire 's search for government subsidies began last October , when the Ohio - based firm announced that it would be closing one of its four US manufacturing centers , due to increased competition from abroad .
It invited local governments and unions to help it decide which plants to keep open by offering packages of incentives and employee concessions .
That invitation immediately set off a scramble for advantage , with all four states attempting to outbid each other for Cooper 's favors .
Mississippi began by offering $ 30 million in incentives -- $ 19 million in state subsidies and tax credits and the rest to be generated locally -- which put pressure on other states to do the same .
Georgia came up with a $ 32 million package , while at Cooper 's unionized Ohio and Arkansas plants , worker concessions on wages and health care were added to financial incentives .
On December 17 , four days after it had reached a deal with the union in Arkansas , Cooper announced that it would be shutting down its plant in Albany , Georgia , even though that state had offered the most generous incentives .
Both the speed of the decision -- which was revealed a month before it had been expected -- and Cooper 's explanation that it had determined that production costs were highest in Georgia , even factoring in the incentive package and low non-union wages , immediately raised questions .
An editorial in the Albany Herald began tactfully , " Based on the information that has come out , it may have been the right decision for Cooper , though it is a devastating blow to a region that is already the ninth - poorest congressional district in the United States .
...
Losing the half - billion dollars a year that Cooper meant to the regional economy will make the hole deeper and harder to climb out of . "
The Herald went on to note , however , that " what makes the already bad situation even worse for many is the suspicion that the decision was made long before the study was conducted .
In mid-November , The Albany Herald received anonymous correspondence from a source that purported to be Cooper employees at Findlay , Ohio .
The letter bore a Findlay postmark .
Verifying the contents of the letter was problematic , but in retrospect the contents proved to be remarkably prescient .
' It is with a great degree of certainty that we know Cooper plans to close the Albany plant , ' the letter stated .
' Unfortunately , the facility study is a ploy to fleece the other states out of any financial assistance they can offer . ' "
If the letter received by the Herald is authentic , suspicion has to fall not only on Cooper Tire itself , but also on Mississippi for setting off the incentive bidding war .
Although Raw Story has not found any evidence of deliberate collusion , there is no doubt that Mississippi officials have been particularly supportive of Cooper .
Cooper
Tire donates to politicians in all the states where it has plants , but it has been particularly generous in Mississippi .
For example , it donated $ 2000 to Governor Barbour 's 2007 reelection campaign .
However , the Mississippi politician most favored by Cooper is Senator Roger Wicker , who resides in Tupelo , where Cooper 's Mississippi plant is located .
When Wicker ran for re-election to the House of Representatives in 2006 , Cooper donated $ 4000 to his campaign .
In the 2007 - 08 campaign cycle , Wicker received $ 7000 from Cooper -- most of it following his appointment by Governor Barbour in December 2007 to fill the Senate seat that had just been vacated by Trent Lott .
This is more than twice as much as Cooper donated to federal campaigns in either Ohio or Arkansas , and more than three times as much as it donated in Georgia .
On November 14 -- prior to the formulation of Mississippi 's incentive package -- Wicker participated in a " Cooper Proud " video on behalf of the Community Development Foundaton , the local affiliate of the Chamber of Commerce .
In the video , Wicker stands before a sign reading , " We 're committed to keeping you in Tupelo ! " and tells local residents in pep rally style , " We are determined to retain Cooper Tire . ...
Your congressional , state , and local public officials are working with Cooper Tire .
... I 'm Cooper Proud -- and I hope you are too . "
Along with his support for Cooper Tire , Wicker is known for being strongly pro-business in general .
He opposes the Employee Free Choice Act , which would make union organizing easier .
According to his Senate website , " He has been honored by the National Association of Manufacturers ( NAM ) for supporting policies which ' recognize manufacturing 's pivotal role in the U. S. economy . '
He received NAM's Award for Manufacturing Excellence in 2006 for support of pro-growth , pro-manufacturing initiatives in the Congress . "

The news you 've all been waiting for : The Scout Update !
Also , we released an update yesterday with a change that needs some clarification .
The update notes said this :
Sticky bombs now get a reduced close range damage ramp up ( like Rocket Launcher & Syringe Gun )
From the response we got , there 's some confusion around this , so we thought it'd be good to do a post that explained what 's going on here .
In TF2 , almost all damage done to players is modified based on the distance from the player to the enemy who did the damage .
There are several reasons why this is done , but the general purpose of it is that it makes close combat resolve faster than long range combat , giving approaching players more time to make tactical decisions ( like whether to engage or retreat ) .
The ramp centers around the 512 units ( roughly 40 feet ) range , and linearly remaps damage done from 150 % at 0 units down to 50 % at > 1024 units .
So if you 're fighting someone closer than 512 units , you 're doing extra damage .
Sticky bombs have an additional complexity on top of this : they use the distance modification for the first 5 seconds of their life , and then turn it off .
This is because it 's generally a dual purpose weapon : used offensively like a rocket launcher , and defensively to create traps .
The 5 second rule essentially means distance matters in the offensive mode , but not at all in the defensive .
So if you 're a trap laying Demoman , you do n't need to get near the stickies when you set them off .
So , yesterdays update reduced the amount of bonus damage that the stickies earned at close range during that first 5 seconds of their life .
Their old distance - based damage ramp range was 150 % -> 50 % variance around the base 120 damage , and the update reduced that to 115 % -> 50 % .
Here 's a handy graph with the details , and it shows how the remap only affects damage closer than 512 units .
Why did we do this ?
We did n't think that the Demoman was overpowered at medium & long ranges , where the charge up time provides an existing penalty .
If we did a straight damage reduction across the board , we would affect that .
In addition , by weakening the Demoman specifically at short range , we 've created a weakness that enemies can take advantage of in combat , and makes the Demoman wary of specific enemy classes ( like the Scout and Pyro ) .
The peanut company at the center of a salmonella scandal filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday , saying the extensive recalls of its products left it no choice but to close .
The Peanut Corporation of America filed for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy law in Virginia , where it is headquartered .
“ This bankruptcy filing , while regrettable , will allow for an orderly liquidation of the company , ” said Andrew S. Goldstein , a lawyer representing the peanut firm .
The company is the subject of a federal criminal investigation for allegedly sending out batches of peanut products that it knew to be contaminated with salmonella .
Company officials could not be located for comment and have not spoken publicly since the outbreak began .
A simplified Zone system for making good exposures
by Norman Koren
Modified May 26 , 2010
This page presents a simplified version of Ansel Adams '
Zone system , suitable for 35 mm and medium format photography , color or black & white .
The bulk of the page was written when film was dominant .
It was revised in October , 2005 to include material on digital photography .
Digital is different .
See Tonal quality and dynamic range in digital cameras for additional advice on exposure for digital cameras .
Polish language version
Correct monitor calibration is vital for viewing and making fine prints .
Two key parameters , Black level ( often labelled Brightness ) and Contrast , are set on the monitor .
A third , Gamma , is set in the video card lookup table ( LUT ) .
Contrast is normally set to maximum .
Color temperature should be set to 6500 K or lower — 6500 K looks best on most CRTs .
It can be set on the monitor ( preferably ) or with the video card / color management software , but not both .
Color quality should be set to 24 or 32 bits .
The room should be dimly lit ; no direct light should shine on the screen .
Gray images should look subjectively gray to your eye .
For flat screen ( LCD ) monitors , Screen resolution ( right - click on the wallpaper , Properties , Settings ) should be set to the monitor 's native resolution .
Gamma defines the curve that relates the pixel levels in your computer to the luminance ( brightness ) of your monitor and prints , using the equation , Luminance = ( pixel level / 255 ) gamma + black level
You can estimate gamma from the pattern on the left side of the chart on the right by viewing it from a distance and observing where the average luminance across the pattern is constant .
Gamma should be set to 1.8 for older Macintosh systems ( 2.2 seems to be the current standard ) or 2.2 for Windows systems and the Internet sRGB color space using techniques in Monitor calibration : Setting gamma .
Gamma is extremely sensitive to viewing angle in most Laptop LCD screens .
This chart is only for monitors ; it does n't work on printed media .
You can set your monitor 's Black level using the mostly black pattern on the right of the chart .
This pattern contains two dark gray vertical bars which increase in luminance with increasing gamma .
( If you can't see them , your black level is way low . )
The left bar should be just above the threshold of visibility opposite your chosen gamma — it should be invisible where gamma is lower by about 0.3 .
The right bar should be distinctly visible , but still very dark .
Black level interacts with gamma ; you may have to go back and forth two or three times .
The pattern provides a good indicator of display quality .
Cheap LCDs can't achieve a constant neutral gray appearance .
But good flat screen displays can be excellent .
For more detail and a larger chart , see Monitor calibration : Gamma and black level .
I encourage you to load this chart on your computer and check it occasionally .
I 'll be happy to grant permission to reproduce it on your website if you e-mail me , give me credit and a link to this page .
If you are new to photography and still unclear on the basic concepts of exposure , Accurate Exposure with Your Meter from Eastman Kodak is a good introduction .
Slides , negatives , and digital
Why then would a serious photographer choose to work with negatives ?
Because negatives can capture a much larger exposure range than slides .
( See What exposure range can film capture ? , below . )
You can make excellent images in difficult lighting that would defeat slide film .
Modern negative films are as sharp as slide films of comparable speed ( possibly sharper ) , though not as fine - grained .
With affordable scanners , image editing programs and color printers , you can produce inexpensive prints of impressive quality — often better than custom darkroom prints , especially when difficult manipulations ( dodging , burning , selective color shifts , etc. ) are required .
Scanners work well with properly exposed slides of low to moderate contrast , but if you work in the field with difficult or contrasty lighting , negatives have an edge .
And difficult lighting can sometimes produce the finest , most dramatic images .
Since this article was first published , digital has overtaken 35 mm and medium format film , though it still can't equal large format for detail .
Digital SLRs ( which have pixel sizes of at least 5 microns ; larger than compact digital cameras ) have impressive dynamic ranges : 10 or more f-stops , comparable to negatives and far better than slides .
But as we shall see , digital images need to be exposed more like slides than negatives to avoid losing highlight detail .
" Expose for the shadows " applies only to negative film ( color or B & W ) ; not to digital .
Introduction to the Zone system
An exception to the dumb exposure meter rule can be found in modern single lens reflex cameras with matrix metering , which tend to be expensive high - end models .
A good example is the Nikon F100 , which has a 10 segment meter .
It meters each segment individually , then uses a computer program to determine the optimum exposure .
The program employs artificial intelligence or fuzzy logic — it 's been taught to respond correctly to a wide variety of scenes .
Of course there will always be exceptions — a reader 's comment in the photo .
net review of the F100 indicates that it can be fooled by backlighting , but it can be trusted most of the time .
Ansel Adams developed the Zone system to cope with this situation ( see history , at the bottom of the page ) .
His technique was to carefully study a scene , visualize the final print , then determine the correspondence between portions of the scene and tones in the print .
He would then meter , expose and develop the negative accordingly .
His basic rule was ,
" Expose for the shadows ; develop for the highlights . "
( Warning : This rule applies only to negative film .
It does NOT apply to slides or digital images ; more later . )

An excellent opportunity to collect high quality photographic prints and support this website .
.
Adams used a view camera and developed each sheet film negative individually , based on the scene contrast and the previsualized print tonalities .
The greater the contrast in relation to the print , the shorter the development time .
His system is very elegant — it produces prints of exceptional tonality , and most images print on a single grade of paper ( Adams preferred grade 2 ) , but it requires a tremendous amount of testing , calibration , record keeping , and time .
It 's not practical unless you have access to a darkroom and plenty of time .
We present a simplified Zone system that will enable you to make excellent exposures .
The technique is identical for color and black and white negatives , but different for slides and digital , where it can be used to find a starting point for bracketing ( for critical work ) .
Once you get the hang of it , you 'll find it 's not all that complex .
The difference between the " simplified " and full Zone system is that in the simplified Zone system you do n't have control over development ; you control only the exposure .
You give up the idea of making most of your prints on a single grade of paper .
This is no problem if you plan to scan your film and print digitally because you have total control over print contrast .
The goal of the simplified Zone system is to expose film for optimum image quality — to make sure all the critical information is present .
Zones
In a scene — in the field — each zone represents a doubling or halving of the luminance — the light reflected from the subject — or equivalently , a difference of one f-stop .
The 8 steps between the nine zones represent a luminance range of 256 ( 28 ) , typical for landscapes on sunny days and somewhat less than negative film can capture .
The actual tonal range of scenes can , of course , be very different .
In a print , zone 1 is pure black , zone 9 is pure white , and zone 5 is subjective middle gray , corresponding to a reflectance of about 18 % .
On good photographic paper , pure white is a little over 90 % reflectance and pure black is about 1 – 2 % reflectance .
The maximum luminance range is around 50 to 100 , equivalent to about 6 zones ; a good deal less than the 8 hypothetical zones in the original scene .
Since the difference between subjective middle gray ( 18 % reflectance ) and white ( a little over 90 % ) is a factor of 5 , equivalent to only 2.3 f - stops , highlight tones in a print tend to be compressed with respect to tones in a scene .
A zone chart printed on paper therefore involves a degree of compromise involving the application of an " S " curve .
The charts below are derived from an equation intended to make zone 5 on a properly calibrated monitor appear as subjective middle gray — about 21 % of the maximum screen brightness level , similar to middle gray on a print ( 18 % reflectance referenced to 90 % white ) .
The equation is in a box near the end of the page .
It may interest math geeks , but it is unnecessary for understanding the Zone system .
The charts for gamma = 2.2 and 1.8 came out closer than I expected .
The major differences are in the lower zones .
The zones below closely resemble those in my 1959 edition of Ansel Adams ' " The Negative . " [ A piece of irresistable trivia : Adams received exactly ten cents royalty for each copy of the book . ]
On a properly calibrated monitor the zones here are more accurate than those in the book .

You will need to have a good feeling for zone 5 — middle gray , so if you do n't entirely trust your monitor — if zone 5 does n't correspond to your idea of middle gray — go to a camera store and buy a Kodak 18 % reflectance gray card .
These cards are used by professionals for exposure metering in the studio :
They place the card next to the subject and meter from it .
This is equivalent to incident light metering : measuring the light that reaches the subject .
With incident metering , the exposure is independent of the subject 's reflectance : dark subjects come out dark and light subjects come out light .
Incident metering works very well in studio environments and for close - ups , but it usually is n't practical for landscapes — the light at the photographer 's position must be the same as the light on the subject .
Incident metering produces excellent results when it can be used .
Meters built into cameras measure reflected light .
Ansel Adams ' description of zones ( geared towards black and white printing )
Low values
Zone 0 Complete lack of density in the negative image , other than film base density plus fog .
Total black in the print .
We will omit zone 0 from the remainder of this tutorial ; zone 1 will be considered pure black .
Omitting zone 0 makes little practical difference .
Zone 1 Effective threshold .
First step above complete black in the print .
Slight tonality , but no texture .
Zone 2
First suggestion of texture .
Deep tonalities , representing the darkest part of the image in which some detail is required .
Zone 3 Average dark materials .
Low values showing adequate texture .
Middle values
Zone 4
Average dark foliage .
Dark stone .
Landscape shadow .
Recommended shadow value for portraits in sunlight .
Zone 5 Clear north sky ( panchromatic rendering ) .
Dark skin .
Gray stone .
Average weathered wood .
Middle gray ( 18 % reflectance ) .
Zone 6 Average Caucasian skin value .
Light stone .
Shadows in snow in sunlit snowscapes .
High values
Zone 7
Very light skin .
Light gray objects .
Average snow with acute side lighting .
Zone 8
Whites with textures and delicate values ( not blank whites ) .
Snow in full shade .
Highlights on Caucasian skin .
Zone 9 Glaring white surfaces .
Snow in flat sunlight .
White without texture .
( The only subjects higher than Zone 9 would be light sources ; they would be rendered as the maximum white value of the paper surface . )
Good exposure
Slides —
The situation is reversed is slides , where overexposure is the cardinal sin .
Overexposed areas are washed out and lacking in detail .
Slides capture a much smaller brightness range than negatives , hence they require very careful exposure .
Some detail may be lost in contrasty scenes , even in well - exposed slides .
Most professionals bracket their slide exposures : expose at nominal , � 1/2 f - stop , � 1 f - stop , and sometimes more .
They would n't think of risking a $ 1000 job to save $ 20 of film .
In landscapes , where the sky and scenery at the top of the frame is often much brighter than at the bottom , a graduated neutral density filter ( dark on top ; clear on bottom ) can be invaluable for reducing the brightness range .
These filters come in several gradients and maximum densities .
It takes practice to use them effectively .
Digital —
As with slides , overexposure resulting in blocked highlights is the most common problem .
Digital sensors are linear , and like all linear devices , they have an abrupt cutoff .
According to Kodak Image Sensors – ISO Measurement , when a digital sensor is exposed for an 18 % reflectance gray card , 106 % reflectance will saturate ( reach pixel level 255 out of 255 ) .
This can result in blocked highlights in contrasty scenes .
Many digital cameras have tonal response " S " curves that reduce the severity of the blocking .
These curves are applied when the RAW files are converted .
Even so , digital photographers must be ever vigilant ; they must pay attention to highlights when setting exposure .
A beginner 's glossary of confusing photographic terms Shutter speed is the amount of time the shutter is open during exposure .
It is the inverse of the number on the dial .
The standard sequence is 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 125 , 250 , 1000 , ... , where 125 represents 1/125 second , etc .
Aperture is the variable opening in the lens that admits light .
F - stop is a measure of the aperture opening , defined as a lens 's focal length divided by the aperture diameter .
F - stops are sequenced in multiples of the square root of two : 1 , 1.4 , 2 , 2.8 , 4 , 5.6 , 8 , 11 , 16 , 22 , etc .
Increasing the f - stop by one step halves the light reaching the film .
F - stop also refers to a change in the aperture by one step , which doubles or halves the light reaching the film .
" Opening up " or " increasing " the aperture means admitting more light ; reducing the f-stop .
Similarly , " stopping down " means admitting less light ; increasing the f-stop .
The speed of a lens is its maximum aperture , i.e. , smallest f-stop .
Film speed is a measure of a film 's sensitivity to light .
Faster films tend to have more grain and less resolving power .
Exposure is the total light reaching the film .
It is a function of the luminance of the subject ( the light it emits ) , the aperture setting , the shutter speed and the film speed .
Photographers often say , " increase the exposure by one f- stop , " or " stop down by two f- stops . "
They do n't literally mean change the aperture .
They mean adjust either the shutter speed or the aperture .
We will use this terminology below .
The heart of the matter : determining exposure
Select an area of the scene , meter it , then adjust the exposure by the difference between the zone you want in the final image and zone 5 ( middle gray ) .
The first devilish detail is that you must be aware of your meter 's sensitivity pattern .
The Zone system was designed for narrow angle meters , such as 1o spot meters ( see sidebar ) .
Typical SLR's have center - weighted meters , whose sensitivity is greatest near , or slightly below , the frame center ( below to respond less to bright skies in horizontally oriented landscapes ) , falling off gradually towards the edge .
These meters are not designed for the Zone system and must be used with care .
You have to average over the region of sensitivity .
If you 're shopping for a new camera , look for one with a narrow angle metering mode .
The second devilish detail is how to determine the region to meter .
For negatives you should bias your choice towards shadow regions — light shadows , not deep ones .
The Zone 3 mountain on the left is a good example .
But it 's OK to take shortcuts .
If a scene is not too contrasty , it 's safe to meter from middle tones ; shadow detail will be maintained .
If it 's very contrasty , try to meter off a shadow area .
If your meter 's sensitivity pattern does n't allow you to isolate shadows , consider opening up one or two f-stops or bracketing , i.e. , making several exposures : nominal , one stop over , etc .
You 'll learn from experience .
For slides and digital , where overexposure must be avoided , you should bias your choice towards middle to lighter regions , with emphasis on the most important part of the image .
For slides , you may want to take several zone - adjusted readings and use them as the basis of bracketing .
For digital , you can make a test exposure , then look at the histogram to be sure highlights are not blocking .
The third devilish detail is how to actually set the exposure .
If you have an old - fashioned camera with manual f- stops and shutter speeds , or an automatic camera with full manual override , you have no problem .
If you have a automatic camera that allows exposure compensation , go ahead and use it , but be forewarned — be mindful !
It 's easy to forget that you 've compensating , and your camera wo n't remind you .
My neighbor lost most of the images from a trip to the Canadian Rockies because he forgot to turn off an exposure compensation mode in his ultra-sophisticated Canon EOS 3 .
( He now has a Canon digital SLR ; no more problems . )
The final detail , not so devilish , is that you must carefully examine each negative or slide when you get it back from the processor .
A lightbox and loupe can help with the evaluation .
( Digital is ever so much easier ; you can examine the histogram in the camera , immediately after the exposure . )
Remember that films , shutters , apertures , and meters all vary , and they can change with time .
The film speed on the box is n't absolute ; it 's only a suggestion .
If your negatives or slides are consistently underexposed , decrease your camera 's film speed setting .
Conversely , if they are overexposed , increase the setting .
Do n't bother trying to figure out exposure from prints .
They 're entirely misleading because most photo labs use programs to expose them , and the density of the print is unrelated to the negative .
Underexposed negatives result in washed out gray shadow areas that beginners often misinterpret as overexposure .
As we engineers say , you must " close the loop , " that is , keep adjusting your technique based on recent results .
If you do , you 'll be rewarded with beautifully exposed negatives and slides nearly every time .
In Ansel Adams ' full Zone system , you would expose to maintain shadow detail , then develop to place highlights in zones of your choosing .
For example , in the scene above you would meter the shaded mountain mountain on the left and expose for zone 3 — two f-stops below the meter 's reading .
You would then meter the highlight area — the sunlit snowy mountain .
Assume you chose to place it at zone 7 , 4 zones above the shadow area .
If it metered 4 zones higher , you would give it a " normal " ( N ) development .
If the scene were contrasty and metered 6 zones higher , you would give it " normal minus 2 " ( N - 2 ; shorter ) development .
Similarly , if it were a flat scene and metered only 2 zones higher you would give it ( N+2 ; longer ) development .
By using this technique , Ansel Adams could make most of his prints on a single grade of paper with beautiful tonalities .
The process of determining development times is beyond the scope of this article ( it takes a lot of work ) ; I 've included this brief description to clarify the difference between the simplified and full Zone systems .
I 'll offer one tip for those of you who do black and white darkroom work .
Adams targeted his development times to print on grade 2 paper .
When I was doing 35 mm and medium format darkroom work , I found that targeting development times so an average scene would print on grade 3 ( higher contrast ) paper resulted in better image quality .
The dense areas of negatives optimized to print on grade 2 paper can get noticeably grainy in small film formats .
This is not an issue with 4x5 and larger formats .
Spot meters are reflected light meters with narrow sensitivity angles , from 10o to 1o for classic models .
They are the most accurate way to implement the Zne system .
Without one you have to compromise , but with practice ( know your meter 's sensitivity pattern well ! ) you should be able to make good exposures most of the time , and know when to bracket ( contrasty situations ) .
If you do n't want to use an external spot meter with your 35 mm camera ( I do n't ) , the next best thing is a manual exposure camera with match - needle spot metering .
The Canon FTb and F - 1 ( both old and " new " models ) meter a rectangular area covering 12 % of the frame — close to ideal for the Zone system .
The " New " F - 1 is my favorite ; its modern meter responds quickly , even in dim light .
The FTb and older F - 1 have slower CdS meters that work well in most situations .
They can be purchased used at reasonable prices .
An important tip : the PX625 / PX13 mercury battery is no longer available ( turns into incredibly toxic waste when thrown out ) .
The MR - 9 battery adaptor from CRIS Camera Services in Phoenix ( 800-216-7579 ) allows you replace it with the widely available Silver 76 battery .
If you enjoy working with the Zone system , you should check out LightZone , a new image editor based on Zone system concepts .
LightZone has a built - in raw convertor and a highly intuitive interface , You may never need to open Photoshop again .
Simplified Zone system summary Know your camera 's metering pattern .
Select a portion of the scene to meter .
Shadow areas are generally preferred for negatives and middle to highlight areas for slides and digital , but the most important part of the scene is often the best choice .
You 'll learn from experience .
Decide the zone in the final image to place this portion of the scene .
( For example , you may want to place dark foliage at zone 4 or snowy mountains at zone 7 . )
Meter the selected portion .
Determine the exposure .
Adjust the meter 's exposure by the difference between your chosen placement and zone 5 .
For example , to place a region on zone 7 , increase the exposure by 2 f - stops over the meter reading .
For slides or digital cameras , highlight areas where detail is to be maintained should be placed no higher than zone 7 .
Practice .
Examine the exposure of your slides or negatives ( but not the prints ) .
Learn to interpret the histogram on your digital camera .
Keep refining your technique and calibrating your equipment .
TIP : You can expand the effective dynamic range of film for photographs of stationary objects taken with a tripod .
Make two exposures : one for the shadows , one for the highlights .
Techniques for combining them are presented by Jonathan Sachs for Picture Window Pro and Michael Reichmann for Photoshop .
Zones and colors

The top row contains zones 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 and 9 .
Tonal values are compressed in the monitor display and print .
( The tonal range is 5 , rather than 8 , zones . ) .
The second row contains dark colors , the third contains pure primaries ( R, Y , G , C , B , M ) , and the fourth contains pastels .
HTML color names are shown in brackets [... ] .
In some cases they differ from conventional names .
This chart is fairly simple to use .
If you are metering off a surface that subjectively resembles one of the colors , make the exposure adjustment ( relative zone 5 ) shown on the right .
For example , if you are metering off a pure yellow surface , increase the exposure by 1.5 f - stops above the meter reading ( zone 5 ) , i.e. , place it at zone 6.5 .
The values on the chart are accurate to about +/-0.25 .

Use the chart for a rough estimate of how to meter off bright colors in the field .
Note that the subtractive primaries ( Y , C , M ) are lighter than the additive primaries ( R = Y + M ; G = Y + C ; B = C + M ) .
Green as we perceive it in nature ( typical leaves and grass ) is generally darker than spectrally pure green ( early spring foliage ) .
Blue as we perceive it in nature ( except for rare deep blue skies in mountains above 3,000 meters ) is generally lighter ( and closer to cyan ) than spectrally pure blue — much lighter for typical " blue " skies .

Imatest Dynamic Range results

— by Russell Cottrell
An exploration of the dynamic range of his digital camera .
What exposure range can film capture ?
This is the characteristic curve for Ektachrome 100VS slide film —
Kodak 's answer to Fuji 's highly saturated Velvia .
E100VS responds to Log Exposures between - 2.0 and - 0.3 : a range of about 1.7 on the log scale or 101.7 = 50 = 5.6 f - stops ( or EV or zones ) .
This is the characteristic curve for Kodak Supra 100 negative film ( now discontinued , but typical ) .
Supra 100 responds to a Log Exposure range of about 3 , equivalent to a ( linear ) range of 103 = 1000 = 10 f - stops , far more than slide film .
Fujichrome Astia 100 ( left ) has a significantly larger exposure range than Velvia 50 , Provia 100 F , or Ektrachrome 100VS .
This should make it superior in many instances for scanning , even though the reduced contrast makes the slides themselves less " snappy . "
It gets a lot less press than Provia or Velvia ( which has an even shorter range than Provia ) .
I have n't tried it .
The exposure range film can respond to , particularly negative film , is further limited by flare light — light that bounces off the interiors of lenses and between the elements .
Flare light fogs shadow regions .
It tends to be worse for zoom lenses than for primes ( single focal length lenses ) because zooms have more elements .
The primary purpose of lens coatings is to reduce flare .
Flare light originates from bright areas — often light sources — inside or outside the frame .
It it 's inside the frame , you just have to hope the lens is well enough designed to keep it under control .
It it 's outside , a lens shade is helpful .
You can use your hand or a hat to shield the lens from glaring light sources like the sun .
When flare is taken into consideration , the actual exposure range of negatives is reduced to between 7 and 9 f - stops .
Because of flare light , it is generally unwise to meter from regions darker than zone 3 .
Of course Ansel Adams could capture longer ranges by using short development times ( normal minus ; N- ) .
He also used small aperture view camera lenses with few elements , and he often used an adjustable bellows lens shade to control flare .
He was shown next to one mounted on his view camera in a 1970's TV commercial .
Nobody knows how many Toyotas ( Datsuns ? ) he sold , but camera shops around the country sold out their tiny stocks of bellows lens shades .
Characteristic curves of digital cameras can now be measured , thanks to the Imatest program .
The total dynamic range , shown here for the Canon EOS - 10 D at ISO 400 , is almost 9 f - stops : nearly as good as negative film .
( It may be better ; the measurement was limited by the 10 f - stop range of the Kodak Step Tablet . )
The practical dynamic range — specified by the maximum allowable noise for a specified level of image quality — depends on the ISO speed .
See the Imatest Stepchart tour for more details .
The characteristic curves provide valuable information on contrast or gamma , which is proportional to the average slope — the change in Density for a corresponding change in Log Exposure — over the film 's sensitivity region .
The green ( G ) curve is most appropriate because the eye is most sensitive to green .
For EV100VS slide film , gamma = ( 0.3-3.3 ) /( - 0.3+2 ) = - 3/1.7 = - 1.76 .
For Supra 100 negative film , gamma = ( 2.5-0.8 ) /( 1.0+2.0 ) = 1.7/3 = 0.57 .
EV100S is three times contrastier than Supra 100 , making it much contrastier than the original scene .
Very punchy .
Film gamma is closely related gamma in digital displays , where brightness = ( pixel level ) gamma , and hence log( brightness ) = gamma * log( pixel level ) .
For negatives , scanner contrast is set much higher than for slides .
Papers for printing negatives also have much higher contrast .
That makes the scanner more sensitive to dust , scratches , and grain , giving slides an advantage for softly lit , low contrast subjects .
Since I now use a digital SLR , which combines the best features of slides ( low noise ) and negatives ( large exposure range ) , I 've put this particular debate behind me .
Equations for zones
The equation is expressed in the following Matlab statements .
zone = 1:9 ; gamma1 = 2.2 ; gamma2 = 1.8 ; f1 = 5.25 ;
y1 = ( ex p ( f1 * sin ( pi * ( zone - 1 ) /16 ) ) - 1 ) / ( exp ( f1 ) - 1 ) ; % Normalized screen levels .
z 1 = y1 . ^( 1/gamma1 ) ; z2 = y1 . ^( 1/gamma2 ) ; % Normalized pixel levels .
px1 = round ( 255*z1 ) ; px2 = round ( 255*z2 ) ; % Pixel levels for gamma = 2.2 , 1.8 y1 is the normalized screen luminance .
There 's nothing sacred or unique about this equation — it 's simple and does the job .
It 's designed so y1 = 0 for zone 1 , y1 = 1 for zone 9 , and y1 = 0.21 ( 21 % ) for zone 5 ( what I perceive to be middle gray ) .
The sin function is responsible for the compression required at high pixel levels .
f1 is set to 5.25 to make y1 = 0.21 ( 21 % ) for zone 5 . z 1 and z2 are the normalized pixel levels ( 0 - 1 ) for gamma = 2.2 and 1.8 , respectively .
px1 and px2 are the corresponding actual pixel levels ( 0- 255 ) .
The results are screen levels y1 = { 0.0000 0.0094 0.0341 0.0922 0.2107 0.4097 0.6688 0.9035 1.0000 }. Pixel levels for gamma = 2.2 are { 0 31 55 86 126 170 212 244 255 Decimal} = { 0 1 F 37 56 7E AA D4 F4 FF Hexidecimal} .
Pixel levels for gamma = 1.8 are { 0 19 39 68 107 155 204 241 255 Decimal} = { 0 13 27 44 6B 9B CC F1 FF Hexidecimal} .
The history of the Zone system , or was Ansel Adams the sole inventor ?
Here 's what Adams says in his Autobiography .
The setting is the Art Center School , Los Angeles , 1940 .
" With the cooperation of Fred Archer , instructor in photographic portraiture , I set out to plan a way by which the students would learn the ' scales and chords ' to achieve technical command of the medium .
It took several weeks in refinement before I could teach it to the students .
I called my codification of practical sensitometry the Zone System . "
I found no mention of Archer in my 1964 edition of Adams ' classic text , " The Negative , " but Christian Boesgaard wrote , " In my 1981 edition , Adams elaborates on the origins of the zone system in the Introduction .
He states that it was done with the " cooperation of an important instructor , Fred Archer , " and , " We based our first plan on articles by John L. Davenport that appeared in U.S. Camera in the Autumn and Winter edition of 1940 " ( citations from page xi ) . "
Much has been made by the new administration of the idea of national service and volunteerism .
While service to one ’s community is certainly admirable , it is not the federal government ’s place to encourage or promote volunteerism .
Moreover , there are troubling signs that national service could transition from voluntary to mandatory , or de facto mandatory , such as the requirement of service in order to be granted a diploma , or something along those lines .
Involuntary servitude was supposed to be abolished by the 13th Amendment , but things like Selective Service and the income tax make me wonder how serious we really are in defending just basic freedom .
The income tax enslaves workers for nearly 4 months out of a year by garnishing what amounts to all their wages in that period of time .
A military draft could demand your very life , without your consent .
This should be unthinkable in a free society .
Proponents of reinstating the draft claim it is needed to protect liberty from enemies abroad .
But what about the enemies of liberty right here at home ?
I am convinced that there are more threats to American liberty within the 10 - mile radius of my office on Capitol Hill than there are on the rest of the globe .
If we would get our troops off of foreign soil , those perceived enemies of our liberty abroad are much more likely to stand down and let us be .
We have more than enough troops to mind our own business and defend ourselves .
It is only for world domination that we have a troop shortage .
Nevertheless , some think recruiting for our military is too low and that the younger generation will not answer the call of duty willingly , and must be drafted by force .
I take extreme exception to this characterization of young people today .
First of all , I believe they correctly see that foreign policy , as unpopular as it has been under Bush , is not significantly changing under Obama , and has little , if anything , to do with defending the United States , and certainly not the Constitution .
Second , many see friends and acquaintances who have voluntarily enlisted , and have taken note of how the soldier , the veteran is treated .
Perhaps rather than blaming younger generations for being selfish , older generations should remember their promises to those who volunteer for military service and be mindful of how they are treated .
Every homeless vet by the side of the road , every suicide , every report of substandard conditions in veteran hospitals is a sign of how we let our military down .
Perhaps we should look to those issues if we have problems with military recruitment , rather than to trample freedom in the name of protecting it .
If that is not enough reason , consider that most in the military are against a draft .
There is a vast difference between serving alongside another volunteer , and serving alongside a reluctant conscript .
Americans need to be on the lookout for any propaganda trying to ease us back into the draft .
Too often a flawed foreign policy prompts the need for a draft .
Abolishing the Selective Service is one thing we could do to counter those efforts .

The Best of Ron Paul
This is the first of a series of blog posts introducing the new C++0 x thread library .
Concurrency and multithreading is all about running multiple pieces of code in parallel .
If you have the hardware for it in the form of a nice shiny multi-core CPU or a multi- processor system then this code can run truly in parallel , otherwise it is interleaved by the operating system — a bit of one task , then a bit of another .
This is all very well , but somehow you have to specify what code to run on all these threads .
High level constructs such as the parallel algorithms in Intel 's Threading Building Blocks manage the division of code between threads for you , but we do n't have any of these in C++0 x .
Instead , we have to manage the threads ourselves .
The tool for this is std :: thread .
Running a simple function on another thread
Let 's start by running a simple function on another thread , which we do by constructing a new std :: thread object , and passing in the function to the constructor .
std :: thread lives in the < thread > header , so we 'd better include that first .
#include < thread > void my_thread_func ( ) {} int main ( ) { std:: thread t( my_thread_func ) ; }
If you compile and run this little app , it wo n't do a lot : though it starts a new thread , the thread function is empty .
Let 's make it do something , such as print " hello " :
#include < thread > # include < iostream > void my_thread_func( ) { std :: cout <<" hello " < < std : : endl ; } int main ( ) { std:: thread t( my_thread_func ) ; }
If you compile and run this little application , what happens ?
Does it print hello like we wanted ?
Well , actually there 's no telling .
It might do or it might not .
I ran this simple application several times on my machine , and the output was unreliable : sometimes it output " hello " , with a newline ; sometimes it output " hello " without a newline , and sometimes it did n't output anything .
What 's up with that ?
Surely a simple app like this ought to behave predictably ?
Waiting for threads to finish
Well , actually , no , this app does not have predictable behaviour .
The problem is we 're not waiting for our thread to finish .
When the execution reaches the end of main ( ) the program is terminated , whatever the other threads are doing .
Since thread scheduling is unpredictable , we cannot know how far the other thread has got .
It might have finished , it might have output the " hello " , but not processed the std : : endl yet , or it might not have even started .
In any case it will be abruptly stopped as the application exits .
If we want to reliably print our message , we have to ensure that our thread has finished .
We do that by joining with the thread by calling the join ( ) member function of our thread object :
#include < thread > # include < iostream > void my_thread_func( ) { std :: cout <<" hello " < < std : : endl ; } int main ( ) { std:: thread t( my_thread_func ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
Now , main ( ) will wait for the thread to finish before exiting , and the code will output " hello " followed by a newline every time .
This highlights a general point : if you want a thread to have finished by a certain point in your code you have to wait for it .
As well as ensuring that threads have finished by the time the program exits , this is also important if a thread has access to local variables : we want the thread to have finished before the local variables go out of scope .
Next Time
In this article we 've looked at running simple functions on a separate thread , and waiting for the thread to finish .
However , when you start a thread you are n't just limited to simple functions with no arguments : in the second part of this series we will look at how to start a thread with function objects , and how to pass arguments to the thread .

Mediation is an alternative method of settling disputes and can facilitate the settlement of car accident claims , without the need for going to court .
It is sometimes resorted to as a result of a court order .
Mediation for car accident insurance is a voluntary and yet confidential method of dispute resolution that is presided over by a third party , who is neutral and acceptable to both sides in the dispute .
Mediation does not close off other alternatives , and in case the dispute is not resolved you can go further into arbitration or take legal recourse .
In most arbitration cases , parties are required to agree to abide by the decision arrived at by an arbitrator .
Most mediators are attorneys who have added special training in dispute resolution and can even be those who have retired from judicial service .
The mediator will not tell the disputing parties what they are required to do , but will try to get them to agree after they identify the issues that are in dispute .
In the case of mediation the control of the final result rests with the disputing parties , while the mediator only acts to facilitate discussion .

While many American states have struggled with problems caused by the economic slowdown , the signs have been out there for a while that California is in danger of imploding — sinking into itself , collapsing under the weight of its problems .
Though it finally passed a budget today , it is moving ahead with a plan to force more than 200,000 state employees to take unpaid furloughs to save state money .
So the news that a 25 - foot - wide sinkhole had opened under Interstate 215 near the town of Murrieta , south of Los Angeles , on Wednesday , shutting down traffic across all lanes of the highway , did little to break the end - of - times vibe that the state ’s residents have been trying to shake off .
Asked today about the 6 - foot - deep divot in Murrieta , Rose Melgoza , a spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation said , “ Yes , I suppose it ’s just one more thing going wrong . ”
While Ms. Melgoza ’s department dispatched an assessment team to the area “ to figure out how we will temporarily shore it up and reopen the freeway or whether we will have to close it long - term to fix it , ” the state ’s legislators could use some shoring up themselves , after spending several recent nights sprawled across their desks as the wrangling over the budget impasse kept up day and night .
A compromise finally attracted the bare minimum votes needed in the State Senate just before 7 a.m. Pacific time .
As Jennifer Steinhauer reports in The New York Times :
After five days of intense , nearly nonstop negotiations over how to close a $ 42 billion gap , California state senators agreed early Thursday morning on a budget that raises taxes , cuts deeply into services and borrows far into the future , leaving nearly every person in the state scathed in some way .
The Los Angeles Times reports from Sacramento that the budget compromise finally cleared the necessary two - thirds - majority hurdle in the Senate after Democratic leaders and California ’s Republican governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , reached a deal with one holdout senator :
Sen .
Abel Maldonado of Santa Maria provided the final Republican vote needed to pass a spending plan , which includes more than $ 12 billion in tax hikes .
In exchange , Democrats agreed to rewrite election rules that Maldonado said had allowed the Capitol to become paralyzed by partisanship , leading the state to the brink of financial ruin .
Gail Collins wrote in an Op - Ed column in The New York Times on Wednesday night that :
Maldonado has always denied that his political ambitions had anything to do with his inability to make up his mind about the budget .
Nevertheless , one of his ongoing demands has been to eliminate money for new office furniture for his mortal enemy , the current controller , John Chiang .
The Los Angeles Times noted that on Wednesday , Mr. Maldonado seemed ready to end his opposition to the budget compromise “ after lunching on salmon and swordfish with Schwarzenegger at an Italian restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol . ”
As chance would have it , sinkholes and the small town of Murrieta were already on the minds of California ’s legislators as they struggled this week to win the votes of anti-tax Republicans for the measure .
As Michael Rothfeld and Eric Bailey reported in The Los Angeles Times today :
Republicans hold only 15 of the state Senate ’s 40 seats .
But they wield significant influence , because two - thirds of lawmakers are needed to approve state budgets , and that requires some G.O.P. votes .
The senators hail mostly from the smaller cities and towns of California , where farming and industry drive the economy , cities are often viewed as sinkholes for state tax dollars , and regulations such as environmental restrictions are seen as an impediment to success .
The G.O.P. senators ’ new leader , Dennis Hollingsworth of Murrieta , was born and raised on a Riverside County dairy farm in a town of 6,000 residents ; he worked early on selling frozen bull semen to dairymen and later as a representative for an association of farmers and ranchers .
And the traffic on California ’s roadways is more central to the state ’s politics than outsiders might understand .
As Michael Lewis explained six years ago in an article for The New York Times Magazine on California politics , the recall of Mr. Schwarzenegger ’s predecessor , Gray Davis , who was kicked out of office after a petition drive , succeeded in no small part because of backing from John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou , the hosts of California ’s highest rated drive - time talk radio program .
Briefly stated , the theory goes like this : Conservative radio hosts thrive on a kind of populist anger at politicians that is not terribly different from the road rage that drivers stuck in traffic feel for other motorists .
As Mr. Lewis wrote in 2003 :
John and Ken started to care about state politics — when politics finally accommodated what they call their “ tone . ”
“ The challenge is to hold onto the tone , ” John says .
Asked to describe the tone , Ken says , “ Rabid dogs . ”
John says : “ I do n’t know that part of the brain that shouts all these things you are n’t supposed to say in polite company , but that ’s the part of the brain we speak to . ”
Ken : “ People relate to the shouts .
What differentiates us from a crazy man is that a lot of people agree with the shouts . ”
John : “ The line we get all the time is , ‘ You say exactly what I feel in the car ! ' ”
Then he laughs .
“ Some part of me always roots for chaos . ”
And , as drivers sit in jams caused by the latest freeway sinkhole in Southern California , John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou are still playing a role in California ’s politics .
The L.A. Times reported today that “ Local politicians fear the conservative radio hosts of the “ John & Ken Show ” on KFI - AM ( 640 ) . ”
For an idea of why , visit their Web site , where the radio hosts issued one “ Action Alert ! ” after another throughout the budget negotiations , imploring listeners to get on the phone to specific state legislators who expressed any willingness to raise taxes .
A recent post on the site also declared :
This is War !
Now it ’s time to go to work .
Call your Legislators and demand they vote no on this huge tax increase !
Contact details for state legislators were provided right after the declaration of “ War ! ”
Most recently , the pair also issued what they called a “ John and Ken fatwa ” against Republicans who support tax increases and have been carrying on what they call a “ heads on a stick ” campaign against their opponents , including Mr. Schwarzenegger , who is himself a Republican .
On the Web site , Mr. Schwarzenegger ’s head is depicted impaled on a sword .
As a drive - time broadcast , the John and Ken Show has not aired yet today , but the show ’s Web site also allows visitors the opportunity to listen live .
Tune in later today to find out what populist outrage against the state ’s budget compromise sounds like .
But it will make more sense if you happen to be trapped in a traffic jam next to the sinkhole in Murrieta while you listen .
Update : Some of the cheering in response to California ’s problems reminds us of what a character in Don DeLillo ’s novel “ White Noise ” said about the state ’s role in the media - saturated American imagination :
We need an occasional catastrophe to break up the incessant bombardment of information .
…
Words , pictures , numbers , facts , graphics , statistics , specks , waves , particles , motes .
Only a catastrophe gets our attention .
We want them , we need them , we depend on them .
As long as they happen somewhere else .
This is where California comes in .
Mud slides , brush fires , coastal erosion , earthquakes , mass killings , et cetera .
We can relax and enjoy these disasters because in our hearts we feel that California deserves whatever it gets .
Californians invented the concept of life - style .
This alone warrants their doom .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) -
Five of the world ’s richest and most powerful hedge fund managers will face a U.S. Congressional panel on Thursday that wants to know if the secretive industry poses risks to the financial system .

John Paulson , George Soros , Philip Falcone , James Simons and Kenneth Griffin were scheduled to testify at the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about the role of hedge funds in financial markets and their regulatory and tax status .
Committee Chairman Henry Waxman , a California Democrat , asked the men to testify because each earned more than $ 1 billion each last year .
The hearing , due to begin at 1000 ET , is the latest in a series Waxman is holding to investigate the causes and effects of the financial crisis .
The hearing comes at a time when several lawmakers have suggested the loosely regulated $ 1.7 trillion industry will face new regulations .
Hedge funds , which are delivering their worst - ever returns this year , have been widely blamed for helping bring down two major U.S. investment banks and for having kicked stock prices lower in the last weeks .
Several fund managers said they were relieved not to have been called to appear before the committee , which demanded that each witness supply details about the funds in advance .
Waxman asked the five fund managers to give the committee a list of all funds controlled , total assets under management , private placement memos , reports to investors and documents about each fund ’s position in credit default swaps .
He also requested documents describing the level of risk associated with the hedge funds and details about how much each man was paid in recent years .
The big paychecks received by top Wall Street executives were criticized by Waxman at recent hearings about American International Group Inc and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc , key players in the U.S. financial crisis .
Another issue likely to arise at the hearing is a recent government action that hedge fund managers say took away an important trading technique and resulted in heavy losses .
Two months ago , U.S. financial regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission briefly forbid money managers from shorting roughly 1,000 financial stocks , or betting the stock price of these companies would decline .
The average hedge fund has lost 15 percent this year , according to Hedge Fund Research and some individual managers have lost a lot more than that .
Heavy losses , coupled with investors ’ demand for their money back , will likely kill off hundreds of the industry ’s estimated 9,000 portfolios this year , industry experts said .
Soros Fund Management chairman George Soros , a billionaire philanthropist who is said to have earned $ 1 billion by betting against the British pound in 1992 , said last month he expects the global financial crisis to cut the hedge fund industry to as little as one - third its current size .
Paulson & Co ’s John Paulson , one of the first investors to bet housing prices could decline on a national basis last year , is making money this year , even as some of the others who will testify are nursing losses .
Kenneth Griffin ’s Citadel Investment Group is facing a difficult year as his flagship Kensington and Wellington hedge funds are off 38 percent through early November .
A tiny molecule found in most plant - based foods douses the flames before damaging lesions can form in the colon , according to a study by Texas AgriLife Research scientist Dr. Nancy Turner .
Even better , the compound can be obtained easily by eating vegetables and fruit rather than by taking expensive prescriptions or supplements , Turner said .
The molecule is quercetin .
Tiny but potent , quercetin gets into the body through onions , peppers , tomatoes and most other common produce but also in " fun things like wine , " she said .
" Just about any plant - based food in the human diet has some level of quercetin . "
Previous studies showed quercetin was effective in reducing the rate of colon cancer in laboratory tests , but Turner 's latest research , published in the Journal of Nutrition , shows how the compound works .
That means researchers may now begin to understand how quercetin could help other inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn 's and celiac disease .
" The nice thing is that albeit high relative to what you see in the American diet , the level used in this study is actually similar to what can be achieved in diets around the world such as in , say , the Mediterranean - style diets , " she said .
" So it 's not an unachievable goal for us good ol ' Americans if we do the right thing with our food consumption . "
For this study , Turner 's team examined the response of quercetin - supplement diets in lab rats -- some in the early stages of colon cancer formation and others without cancer .
" Early lesions in a colon are some of the first true changes in the colon that can be observed visually , " she said .
" This in not just something you see in our animal model .
You see it in human patients as well . "
Called " aberrant crypts , " they are thought to be a marker or predictor of tumor formation .
Quercetin is known to reduce the number of these crypts , she noted , " But we wanted to know how it might be protecting . "
Cancer is often characterized as an uncontrolled growth in our bodies , but scientists now say that a natural process of cell death , or " apoptosis , " is also critically important in cancer , Turner said .
That is , a healthy body should have an equilibrium between new cells and cells that have done their job and are ready to be sloughed off .
" We found that we were deriving benefit from both of those , " Turner said of the quercetin diet study .
" We were able to decrease the number of cells that were proliferating in the colon .
And we were able to increase the number of cells that were undergoing apoptosis .
So the net effect of that is , we were able to maintain almost a normal number of cells . "
Turner 's team then decided to examine relatively new findings - that inflammation is one of the biggest contributors of the development of colon cancer .
They targeted two enzymes - known to researchers as Cox - 1 and Cox - 2 .
The first is a routine protein that the body expresses all the time , she said .
But the second Cox has implications in a lot of diseases .
" Cox - 2 is an inducible protein that is expressed in the body when there is some kind of external stimulous to a cell .
We think of high levels of Cox - 2 as being a bad thing . "
One of those bad things is colon cancer .
Not only is Cox - 2 present in that disease , but recent research showed that before Cox - 2 levels rose in colon cancer , the Cox - 1 levels first became elevated .
Cox - 1 , therefore , has some sort of control over whether Cox - 2 gets expressed , she explained .
" We did see that both groups - both the control groups and the carcinogen - injected groups that were consuming quercetin in their diets - had lower levels of both Cox - 1 and Cox - 2 , " Turner said .
" So that would tend to suggest that there may be opportunity for quercetin to suppress tumor development . "
She said that additional research is needed on this portion of the work to better understand the connections .
But she advised people to go ahead and eat plenty of fruits and vegetables .
" Overall , one of the best recommendations we 've all heard from the day we were children is 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away . '
The only addition is , do n't peel your apple , " she said .
Compounds such as quercetin in plants are initially there to protect the plant against pests , UV sun rays and other problems , Turner said .
" So these compounds are located where the plant most needs them , which is typically on the outside - in the peel .
Try your best to eat the whole food where ever possible , so that you can get the most from these beneficial compounds . "
She noted that in addition to colon cancer , quercetin has shown positive impacts in warding off other chronic ailments such as cardiovascular disease .

Turner 's research was funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center at Texas A&M University .

Colourful plumage linked to immune response in tawny owls .
Female tawny owls with dark red feathers have immune systems that respond more strongly to infection .
J. Gasparini
The colour of a bird 's feathers may by an indication of the strategy its immune system uses to beat pathogens , according to a new study .
Pigments in feathers have been linked to the overall health of birds before .
The carotenoids that give the blue - footed booby 's feet their distinctive colour , for example , are also antioxidants that are found in its food .
So a booby that is suffering from infection or starvation will have less colourful feet than a healthy bird .
But now researchers in France have shown that female tawny owls ( Strix aluco ) with dark red plumage mount a more powerful response to infection than females with lighter feathers .
However , this stronger response comes at a cost : darker females lost more weight over the course of the study than pale females .
The discovery suggests that rather than advertising overall health with their colour , females are advertising their immune strategy .
" We think these colours are being used in sexual selection , " says Julien Gasparini of the Laboratory of Ecology and Evolution at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris , who led the team .
If individuals are living in an environment in which disease is a big threat , Gasparini predicts that darker females might be preferentially chosen by males because their heavily protective , but energetically expensive , genes benefit offspring .
In contrast , lighter females would be preferred in less infested areas .
A colourful inheritance
Carotenoids only account for a small percentage of colouration .
Melanin , another pigment , is very common and is often involved in camouflage colouration .
But there has been little evidence that melanin is connected with the health of an animal and many species ranging from the red- tailed hawk ( Buteo jamaicensis ) to the southern platyfish ( Xiphophorus maculatus ) have melanin - related colouring for no obvious reason .
This has left researchers wondering what the pigment does in these animals .
Gasparini and his colleagues decided to investigate the role of melanin in wild tawny owls .
The team collected feathers from 102 egg - laying tawny owls , digitally photographed them , and used software to analyse their colour .
They repeated the experiment on the 258 chicks that later hatched and found that colour was heritable .
The researchers then vaccinated roughly half of the adults with a cocktail of antigens from diseases such as tetanus and diphtheria .
Between 6 and 38 days later , birds were recaptured and weighed , and samples of their blood analysed for antibodies to determine the strength of the immune response .
Reporting in the Journal of Animal Ecology1 , the researchers reveal that the degree of red in a female 's feathers is closely linked to the amount of antibody that she produced against the vaccines , with dark red females maintaining a higher level of antibodies for a longer period than paler females .
Advertising strengths
Whether melanin is linked to the immune strategies of all birds in this way is not yet known .
But the researchers suggest that colour could be signalling the presence of metabolic traits that would otherwise remain invisible .
ADVERTISEMENT
" The combined usage of biochemistry , immunology , behavioural ecology and genetics in this study of animal colouration is unparalleled , " says Kevin McGraw , who researches bird colouration at Arizona State University in Tempe .
" It is tempting to speculate that the genes associated with melanin pigment production are intimately associated with the immunological machinery for parasite defence " , he says .
But for that to be explored , comparisons between the genetics of dark and pale owls need to be conducted .
" It would be great if we could go beyond heritability and look at gene expression and map genetic differences between the colour morphs " says Geoffrey Hill , a biologist at Auburn University in Alabama .

The spookfish has a pair of mirrors ( black ) to focus light from below into its eyes
A Pacific fish uses mirrors as well as lenses to help it see in the murky ocean depths , scientists have revealed .
The brownsnout spookfish has been known for 120 years , but no live specimen had ever been captured .
Last year , one was caught off Tonga , by scientists from Tuebingen University , Germany .
Tests confirmed the fish is the first vertebrate known to have developed mirrors to focus light into its eyes , the team reports in Current Biology .
" In nearly 500 million years of vertebrate evolution , and many thousands of vertebrate species living and dead , this is the only one known to have solved the fundamental optical problem faced by all eyes - how to make an image - using a mirror , " said Professor Julian Partridge , of Bristol University , who conducted the tests .
Spookfish is a name often given to Barreleyes - a group of small , odd - looking deep - sea fish species , found in tropical - to - temperate waters of the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian Oceans .
A rare live brownsnout spookfish , Dolichopteryx longipes , was caught last year between New Zealand and Samoa , by Professor Hans - Joachim Wagner , of Tuebingen University .
Deep see
While the animal appears to have four eyes , it technically has two , each of which is split into two connected parts .
The spookfish needs one half to point upwards , to capture faint glimmers of light from the sea surface 1,000 m above .
The other half , which looks like a bump on the side of the fish 's head , points downwards .
Seen from below , the mirrored eyes ( red ) focus light from the depths
These " diverticular " eyes are unique among all vertebrates in that they use a mirror to make the image .
Prof Partridge said : " Very little light penetrates beneath about 1,000 m of water and like many other deep - sea fish , the spookfish is adapted to make the most of what little light there is .
" At these depths it is flashes of bioluminescent light from other animals that the spookfish are largely looking for .
" The diverticular eyes image these flashes , warning the spookfish of other animals that are active , and otherwise unseen , below its vulnerable belly . "
The mirror uses tiny plates , probably of guanine crystals , arranged into a multi- layer stack .
Prof Partridge made up a computer simulation showing that the precise orientation of the plates within the mirror 's curved surface is perfect for focusing reflected light on to the fish 's retina .
It its murky world , the spookfish 's visual system would give it a head start on its prey whilst at the same time providing those vital few moments of advance notice to escape the clutches of a predator .

The Secret of Dealing with the Financial Crisis
More often than not , our view of ( rather than the situation itself ) dictate our state of mind .
Some people would still be happy even if the world came crashing down .
For others , a minor setback would spark off a downward spiral of deeper sadness .
New circumstances are thrown at us day in and day out .
We can either make the best of it or make it worst .
It is up to us .
The Danger of the Trusted News
Lately , we hear lots of stuff over the news :
We are in the worst economic environment in decades
Everyone is losing jobs .
Look at that employment number at 7.2 % .
All banks are failing , what should we do ?
The unemployment number is climbing and it ’s never good when this happens , but the unemployment number was at 5.8 % in 2005 ( Bureau of Labor Stats ) .
Putting it into context , this means that less than 2 people were laid off for every 200 people we know on average .
Is it worst than it was in 2005 ?
Absolutely .
Is it really Armageddon ?
Hardly .
Our Expectation is Sometimes Just Too High
What about our net worth that came crashing down ?
Whether it ’s our stock holdings , our house value or our spending power , this chart pretty much sums it all up .
I bet a few years ago when your house or stock went to crazy highs ( somewhere around the red line ) , you were extremely happy .
The value of your asset went down rapidly the past few months .
So did mine .
In fact , if this chart illustrates the value of the asset , it went down 50 % off its highs .
It hurts to see it but other than our ego , did it change things that much ?
Going back to our example , is n’t it just back to the value it was a few years ago ?
The exact same level when we were celebrating ?
The Real Danger
Some of us got into trouble because of how we handled our new found wealth .
As our asset value rose , we began to increase our standard of living .
Each time our stocks went up , we poured in more material to build another step .
Now that the new money has stopped , so did the ability to continue building .
For some , it has gotten so bad that their standard of living fell off a cliff as their money supply dried up .
For those that lived life just the same , what really changed ?
What is Your View ?
There are certainly many people who are in trouble now but they are just the minority .
Unfortunately , most of us are spooked by the reporting on those suffering .
We are afraid because of the over - exaggerated news articles ; we are frighten by what could ( but is unlikely ) to happen and we are worried that the sky is really falling .
But is it that bad ?
Do you really have to be afraid and how likely is the worst going to happen ?
Answer those questions truthfully and perhaps the rest of you day will be much brighter .
Have a Great One .

Do n't ignore Bush 's torture confession , Olbermann pleads David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday January 19 , 2009
Print This Email This
On the eve of the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann delivered perhaps his most heartfelt argument yet for prosecuting high administration officials who authorized torture .
As Olbermann explained in a diary at Daily Kos shortly before delivering his Special Comment , " The prosecution of torture might not have to be the first priority ; it might not have to be a sweeping event consuming the nation , but we must have a catharsis .
Most importantly , the great and tragic events of our history have proven that the failure to achieve such a catharsis , the failure to atone , has its own tragic , long - range consequences . "
" We have tortured people , you and I , " Olbermann said in beginning his Special Comment .
" This is the people 's democracy , we are the people , these are our elected officials .
That they did not come to us and ask to act thusly in our names is unfortunate , indeed criminal , but it is also almost irrelevant .
They work for us , and they have tortured people , and so we have tortured people . "
Olbermann went on to cite George Bush 's recent acknowledgment that he had approved the interrogation techniques used on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as evidence that " Mr. Bush is guilty , he 's guilty as sin . "
President - elect Obama , however , has suggested that he feels ambivalent about the idea of holding Bush administration officials fully accountable .
He recently stated , " I also have a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards .
...
How do we make sure that moving forward we are doing the right thing ? "
As legal expert Jonathan Turley explained to Olbermann last week , Obama 's remarks may have been concerned more with the treatment of CIA officers who were assured that what they were ordered to do was legal than with the administration officials who issued the orders .
However , Olbermann took Obama 's words as signaling his overall approach .
" As commendable as the intention here might seem , " Olbermann noted , " this country has never succeeded in moving forward without first cleansing itself of its mistaken past .
In point of fact , every effort to merely draw a line in the sand and declare the past dead has served only to keep the past alive -- and often to strengthen it .
We compromised with slavery in the Declaration of Independence -- and fourscore and nine years later , we had buried 600,000 of our sons and brothers in a Civil War . "
Olbermann went on to cite succeeding compromises that enabled problems to fester , right down to the compromises following Watergate that encouraged the junior members of the Ford administration to " [ grow ] up to be Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney . "
" Someday there will be another Republican president , " Olbermann cautiouned Obama , " or even a Democrat just blind as Mr. Bush to ethics and this country 's moral force .
And he will look back to what you did about Mr. Bush -- or what you did not do -- and he will see precedent .
Or , as Cheney saw , he will see how not to get caught next time . "
" It is up to you , not just to discontinue this , but to prevent it , " Olberman concluded .
" Mr. President - elect , you have been handed the beginning of that future .
Use it to protect our children and our distant descendants from anything like this ever happening again . "
A full transcript of Olbermann 's Special Comment is available at Crooks and Liars .

There are quite a few good DVDs coming out this week .
Of course , the highest selling of them will probably be High School Musical 3 : Senior Year , those teenagers seem to get whatever they want .
John Gulager ’s latest Feast III : The Happy Finish is also coming out this week .
John Gulager won the opportunity to be the director in Project Greenlight season 3 back in 2005 , where he directed Feast .
Feast is quirky little horror comedy written by Marcus Dunstan , and Patrick Melton , they teamed back up to release 2008 ’s Feast II : Sloppy Seconds , the comedy was n’t quite there , but the gore definitely was .
Let ’s see if Feast III lives up to the first .
Clint Eastwood ’s Changeling , stars Angelena Jolie in a thrilling true story .
Jolie plays a Woman whose son is kidnapped , but when the overzealous Los Angeles Police Department returns the wrong boy , her life is turned upside down and her sanity is questioned .
Bill Maher ’s Religulous is also coming out this week .
Religulous takes a look at religions as Bill travels the world asking people about their beliefs , and mocking them of course .
Also released this week was Body of Lies .
Body of Lies follows Leonardo Dicaprio and Russell Crow as two CIA Agents hunting down the mastermind behind a series of terrorist attacks .
One of the Best shows on Showtime was Brian Fuller ’s Dead Like Me , which followed an 18 year old girl who becomes a grim reaper after getting killed by a toilet seat that fell from the international space station .
The show ’s first season was great , if not as great as Fuller ’s earlier show Wonderfalls , and the second season was pretty good ( Fuller was forced out over creative differences ) , and it never reached a third .
This week sees the release of Dead Like Me : Life After Death in an attempt to revive the series .
The movie has the same humor and wit as the series , but without Brian Fuller and Mandy Patankin , and with a replacement Daisy can it really bring back the show ?
And this week ’s DVD Pick of the Week is Choke .
Choke was written by Chuck Palahniuk , the guy who wrote Fight Club , and stars Sam Rockwell .

The UN and the mainstream media are wailing and accusing Israel of war crimes ( yes , again ) after the IDF returned fire at a UN school from which Palestinians were firing mortars .
The explosives and booby traps installed in the school by Hamas then blew up , killing dozens of people .
And the world blames Israel .
30 reported killed in blast at UN school .
At least thirty people were reportedly killed and 53 wounded in an explosion in a UN - run school in the town of Jabalya in the northern Gaza Strip , according to Palestinians .
The IDF issued a statement saying the school grounds were used by terrorists to fire mortar shells at the troops .
The infantrymen returned mortar shell fire into the school grounds , the army said .
Defense officials told The Associated Press that booby - trapped bombs in the school triggered the secondary explosions which killed scores of Palestinians on the site .
In 2007 , the IAF actually filmed some of these terrorists at a Gaza school , firing mortars into Israel .
The media do n’t seem to care .

Lord Mandelson ’s famed silver - tongue deserted him on a business trip to New York when he responded with a four - letter tirade against one of America ’s most senior entrepreneurs , the Starbucks boss Howard Schultz .
The American , chief executive of the world ’s biggest coffee chain , spoke of his corporation ’s recent struggles in a television interview .
“ The concern for us is western Europe and specifically the UK , ” he said .
“ The UK is in a spiral . ”
Mr Schultz described consumer confidence in Britain was “ very , very poor ” .
The furious Business Secretary resorted to an uncharacteristic Anglo - Saxon turn of phrase , storming at a cocktail party in New York : “ Why should I have that guy running down the country ?
Who the fuck is he ? ”

Lord Mandelson added a withering comment on Starbucks ’ assessment of the UK economy , adding : “ How the hell are they doing ? ”
Starbucks plans to close 900 of its 16,000 outlets worldwide as consumers buy fewer £ 2 - a - time lattes and mochas .
Lord Mandelson , on a brief visit to New York to bang the drum for British business , overheard an interview by the normally - careful Mr Schultz , and the Business Secretary ’s face reddened .
In a public interview on the CNBC TV station , he used less fragrant language but was no less damning in his comments : “ The UK is not spiralling , although I have noticed that Starbucks is in a great deal of trouble .
But that may be because of their over exposure given the state of the market .
So please do not project Starbucks on to the UK economy as a whole . ”
As communications chief of the Labour Party in the mid-1990s , Lord Mandelson guided Tony Blair to power in 1997 by softening the party ’s image , famously introducing its red rose emblem and backing well - groomed politicians to represent the party on television .
As Northern Ireland Secretary and Trade Secretary , his delivery was rarely less than polished , in public at least , and he has continued to be an exemplar of diplomacy since he returned to the Cabinet last year .
He was less guarded at an official reception at the British consul ’s residence in New York , where he swore about the company , which has two million customers and 713 stores in Britain .
Lord Mandelson , in the US to counter the fears of investors who were receiving too gloomy a picture about Britain ’s economic prospects , was unrepentant about his outburst , although he conceded he did not need to swear .

His spokesman told The Independent : “ We stand by the statement , but we do n’t stand by the language . ”
Starbucks later said that Mr Schultz had not intended to do down Britain , which is its third biggest market after the US and Canada .
Lord Mandelson ’s comments prompted a conciliatory response from the coffee chain , which said in a statement : “ It is a difficult economic situation in the US and around the world .
Please be assured that Starbucks has no intention of criticising the economic situation in the UK . ”
The Seattle - based company added : “ The reality of the global economy is that no country is immune to the difficulties .
We are all in this together and as a global business we are committed to each and every market we serve .
“ Starbucks has been committed to the UK since it arrived in 1998 .
Today , the UK is one of its most important markets with over two million customers welcomed in more than 700 coffee houses every week nationwide . ”
However , its stores have been undercut by cheaper fast - food outlets and pub chains , which have made a pitch for the mid-morning coffee break with cheap filter coffee .
Starbucks also faces competition from rival chains and , unlike in the US , it is not the biggest coffee corporation here , with fewer outlets than Costa Coffee .
A spokeswoman for Starbucks said : “ In the UK we have n’t confirmed any news of closures .
What we are doing at the moment is reviewing the portfolio of stores . ”
Lord Mandelson , accompanied by the Health Secretary Alan Johnson , held talks with American drug companies about investing in the UK .
After hearing Starbucks ’ statement , Lord Mandelson said : “ I ’m glad Mr Schultz has stepped back from his remarks .
I made my point and I regard the matter as closed . ”
Lord Mandelson said Britain and the US were in a difficult position , having made the first moves to combat the banking crisis but yet to see the first “ signs of change ” .
He said there was “ no value in trying to create frenzy ” , and highlighted the need for a “ steady nerve and cool judgment ” .

Its chief executive , Richard Kimber , was Google 's managing director of South - East Asia until the middle of last year .
He said his key reason for leaving Google was the challenge of working at a growth company and finding a way to make money from the millions of social networking users , a problem also faced by the largest sites , Facebook and MySpace .
Although Friendster is by far the largest social networking site in Asia , fewer than 6 per cent of its users are in the US and there are only 1 million Australian registered users .
Kimber said that , despite the dominance of MySpace and Facebook and the high barriers for users to switch to a new social network , it was " still very early days in the space and by no means has the race been won " .
Friendster was founded in 2002 , two years before Facebook and a year ahead of MySpace , originally as a dating website before evolving into a broader social network .
" [ Friendster ] has more personalisation of your profile page than say a Facebook , " Kimber said .
" Facebook is quite utilitarian whereas Friendster is more focused on community and also family - there 's a lot of Friendster users that have extended family and family 's a very core concept in Asia and very much epitomises the social structure of how Asians connect and relate to each other .
" A lot of these Asian countries do not have social security or the dole so families support each other and Friendster is a key way that families in Asia contact each other . "
Friendster , which declined a $ US30 million buyout offer from Google in 2003 , is a private company so does not make its earnings public and Kimber would not say whether the site was profitable .
Facebook , despite its 150 million active users , only generated an estimated $ US300 million in revenue last year , while MySpace , which has diversified into more of an entertainment site , was expected to book close to $ US1 billion .
MySpace , part of the News Corp empire , has loaded the site up with ads while Facebook has taken a more cautious approach out of fear it might annoy users .
Facebook users in particular have been reluctant to accept new forms of highly lucrative , targeted advertising based on personal information provided to the site as this is seen as an invasion of privacy .
Another problem with trying to earn money from social networks is that brands can advertise on the site for free by creating applications , starting up their own pages and running competitions .
For instance , Burger King recently offered a free Whopper to people who deleted 10 friends in what it dubbed a " Whopper sacrifice " promotion , but Facebook did not earn a cent .
Kimber says the social networking sites that remain in the long term will be the ones that can develop the most lucrative business models .
For now , Kimber can rest easy as Friendster recently raised $ US20 million and is backed by blue - chip venture capitalists including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , which was one of the original investors in Google .
But the investors will eventually be agitating for a return on their cash injections and Kimber said it was not good enough to focus solely on display advertising .
" The North Asian social networks have used other methods to monetise such as virtual goods and gaming and these are more likely to be the areas that we 'll focus on rather than just purely advertising , " he said .
Kimber said he would " love to conquer Australia one day " but for now the focus was on Asia due to its significant growth prospects .
" The US is largely saturated , Europe is becoming saturated , " he said .
" The next billion users on the internet are going to come from Asia , they 're not going to come from Europe or America . "
Using inexpensive off - the - shelf components , an information security expert has built a mobile platform that can clone large numbers of the unique electronic identifiers used in US passport cards and next generation drivers licenses .
The $ 250 proof - of - concept device - which researcher Chris Paget built in his spare time - operates out of his vehicle and contains everything needed to sniff and then clone RFID , or radio frequency identification , tags .
During a recent 20 - minute drive in downtown San Francisco , it successfully copied the RFID tags of two passport cards without the knowledge of their owners .
Paget 's contraption builds off the work of researchers at RSA and the University of Washington , which last year found weaknesses in US passport cards and so - called EDLs , or enhanced drivers ' licenses .
So far , about 750,000 people have applied for the passport cards , which are credit card - sized alternatives to passports for travel between the US and Mexico , Canada , the Caribbean , and Bermuda .
EDLs are currently offered by Washington and New York states .
" It 's one thing to say that something can be done , it 's another thing completely to actually do it , " Paget said in explaining why he built the device .
" It 's mainly to defeat the argument that you can't do it in the real world , that there 's no real - world attack here , that it 's all theoretical . "
Use of the cards is expected to rise as US officials continue to encourage their adoption .
Civil liberties groups have criticized the cards and a travel industry association has called on the federal government to suspend their use until the risks can be better understood .
The cards make use of the RFID equivalent of optical barcodes known as electronic product code tags , which are widely used to track cattle and merchandise as it's shipped and then stored in warehouses .
Because the technology employs no encryption and can be read from distances of more than a mile , the tags are highly susceptible ( PDF ) to cloning and tracking , researchers have concluded .
Paget 's device consists of a Symbol XR400 RFID reader ( now manufactured by Motorola ) , a Motorola AN400 patch antenna mounted to the side of his Volvo XC90 , and a Dell 710 m that 's connected to the RFID reader by ethernet cable .
The laptop runs a Windows application Paget developed that continuously prompts the RFID reader to look for tags and logs the serial number each time one is detected .
He bought most of the gear via auctions listed on eBay .
And if you read on , we 'll show you video proof that the thing actually works .
{ January 2 , 2009} Eclipse
It has been nearly three years since I began transitioning and I have not honestly attempted to chronicle any portion of my transition .
Perhaps this is a bit out of order , but I ’d rather start with the more recent months of the end of 2008 as they are the most significant , painful , and wonderful months of my life .
This phase of my life started on exactly June 22 , 2008 at , how appropriately , Baltimore Pride .
I felt a bit out of place amongst so many gay people .
An outsider .
As the day wore on I started to loosen up and enjoy the horrid , soupy weather , crazy drag queens on the stage , and the amusing antics of the Westboro Baptist protesters ( always good for a laugh ) .
I met a few interesting people and bumped into a number of old acquaintances , but nothing could compare to the glimpse I caught of a raven - haired beauty sporting a little black tanktop and a milk chocolate brown skirt slipping through the crowds .
I spent the next two hours hunting through the throngs of people attempting to find her again and finally gave up .
The event grounds were n’t exactly large , but I was frayed from the heat .
Imagine my surprise when I found her at the table for Baltimore ’s Gender Identity Group .
I was so distracted and sheepish that I put my email on the FTM ’s mailing list .
Thankfully my friend , an FTM , made for a valid enough reason to avoid any further embarrassment .
I eyed up this gorgeous woman out of the corner of my eye , this distracted , bored , and somewhat drunk beauty .
My nerve failed me and I could n’t bring myself to introduce myself to her but I knew I ’d likely have another chance at the support group .
Yes , I ’m admitting that 90 % of my motivation for going to this support group was to meet a girl .
A month would pass before I had my chance .
I tarted myself up , stuffed every bit of extra cash I had into my purse and sauntered off to the meeting with the intention of getting very drunk at least .
The meeting passed without incident and as our group traveled over to the Mt. Vernon Stable for our post - meeting dinner I followed by the target of my affection like a lost puppy .
We chatted a bit and I had a chance to get a glimpse of how brilliant and vibrant she is .
Like a bimbo , I started blabbing about how I had a wad of cash and planned on getting trashed .
I ’m sure I sounded like some Girls Gone Wild reject , but I did n’t care .
I was incredibly excited .
I mentioned offhand , as we passed by Club Hippo , that I had never been dancing .
She urged me to try the place out and I made my move .
And by “ made my move ” I mean I blathered and squealed about how we should go .
For reference , my transportation and recent ex was with me .
He knew I was incredibly attracted to this girl and did n’t seem to have much of a problem with the situation ( or so I assumed , considering he was fucking a friend of mine ) .
In one night , I had my first drink at a gay bar , I had my first encounter with a girl that I actually asked out instead of the other way around , and I had my first incredibly enticing rendezvous on the dance floor .
That memory still stands out in my mind … the two of us pressed against each other , her fingers tangled in my hair and my arms wrapped across her body .
Sweating , gyrating , gasping .
Up until that point it was probably the most erotic moment of my entire life .
We ended up back at her place … plus one third wheel .
My ex , being dense or abusive , did n’t exactly … leave .
We sat about , drank a little whiskey , wandered off to a diner for a breakfast , and found ourselves in her bed .
Again , with a third wheel .
I napped fitfully , fretting about how I ’d even express my interest with my ex snoring alongside me .
Needless to say it was an awkward situation .
Yet , when I woke up and glanced over , biting my lip , I saw her smiling back at me .
Those stormy slate eyes and that perfect smile .
The fear melted and I reached over to touch that exquisite face .
That was the moment I knew I had found someone special .
While I might be a bit too pragmatic to say it was ‘ love at first sight ’ , I knew I was ensorceled by her charm .
Events became considerably more awkward when my ex woke up , but he eventually made his way off to work and left us alone .
I ’ll not detail the events of that day , but it was beyond words .
And so our life began together in the strangest of ways .
A chance meeting , a heady mix of alcohol and sex , and an awkward situation with an old boyfriend .
Here we are , nearly six months later .
In those months I lost my job , moved out of Sykesville ( much to my joy ) , and moved in with this girl .
We have argued , we ’ve cried ( A LOT … estrogen does that ) , we ’ve laughed hysterically .
We ’ve drank , we ’ve fucked , we ’ve cuddled .
We ’ve danced , we ’ve worried , we ’ve struggled .
I ’ve questioned everything about myself from my presentation to my identity , and how I ’m going to ever make it through life .
Every time I ca n’t take anymore and I ’m balled up in a fetal position and barely able to breathe , she ’s there with her arms around me and whispering sweet words .
I could n’t have made it this far or blossomed as much as I have if it were n’t for her .
This posting is for you Jennifer .
You ’ve reminded me that life is worth living , not just surviving .
You ’ve shown me a depth of compassion and patience that still boggles my mind .
You ’ve carried yourself with grace and gentle strength that has inspired more out of me than I ever thought possible .
Thank you .
I love you Jennifer .
Here ’s to another six months , hopefully a bit less crazy .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former President George Bush should have pardoned Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Dick Cheney said after stepping down as vice president this week .
Lewis " Scooter " Libby was convicted of lying to a grand jury and investigators in 2007 .
" He was the victim of a serious miscarriage of justice , and I strongly believe that he deserved a presidential pardon .
Obviously , I disagree with President Bush 's decision , " Cheney told Stephen F. Hayes of the Weekly Standard , a leading conservative Washington magazine .
Libby , Cheney 's former chief of staff , was convicted of obstructing a federal investigation into the revelation that Valerie Plame Wilson was a CIA agent .
He was sentenced to 30 months in prison and fined $ 250,000 .
Bush commuted the sentence , which he called " excessive . "
But he did not pardon Libby , much to the aggravation of many influential conservatives .
Unlike a presidential pardon , which wipes a person 's crimes off the books , Bush 's commutation of Libby 's sentence only means that he does not have to serve the prison sentence .
He is still considered guilty of the crime of which he was convicted .
Hayes said that Cheney had publicly disagreed with Bush only four times in the eight years of the Bush administration .
They were out of office for only a day before this disagreement surfaced .
Bush granted 189 pardons and 11 commutations during his eight years in office , far fewer than Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan in their two - term administrations .
No one was ever charged with leaking Plame Wilson 's identity .
She and her husband , former diplomat Joseph Wilson III , said the revelation was a retaliation for Wilson claiming a key justification for the invasion of Iraq was false .
It ultimately came out that former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage had told journalist Robert Novak about Plame Wilson working for the CIA .
Top Bush adviser Karl Rove confirmed it .
CNN 's Ed Hornick contributed to this report .
All About Dick Cheney • Lewis Libby
A name in danger of extinction ( or perhaps more accurately : imprisonment ) , the netbook has gained a new ally in the form of Dell , Inc .
The netbook maker indirectly lent a hand to the Save the Netbooks campaign this week by petitioning to cancel a small company 's trademark on the term .
Netbooks — compact , low - cost , and low - margin notebooks primarily designed for surfing the Web on - the - go — have grown quite rapidly in popularity over the last year or two .
Sales are quite strong , especially amid an economic downturn , but Psion , a company that stopped selling a Windows - CE - powered " Psion netBook " in 2003 , is none too happy .
As the owner of a trademark on the word " netbook " ( which is still live , according to the USPTO ) , the company recently flexed its IP muscles . �
Psion went on a cease - and - decist rampage in January , threatening journalists , manufacturers , and even bloggers in order to get them to stop using the term by the end of March 2009 .
It even convinced Google to ban the term from AdSense ads .
Psion says it is " reaffirming " its trademark and wants the freedom to perhaps make one in the future , but Dell is having none of it .
In a petition for cancellation filed at the USPTO ( PDF link ) , Dell puts forth three logical reasons for nullifying Psion 's " netbook " trademark : abandonment , fraud , and genericness .
Psion was issued its netbook trademark in relation to " laptop computers " on November 21 , 2000 , but Dell points out that Psion is not currently selling laptop computers under the netbook trademark .
In fact , Psion discontinued the only line of netbooks it ever sold in 2003 , and regards its use of the trademark to be only " somewhat reduced " ( PDF link ) due to the accessories it still sells for those machines .
Dell 's second argument — fraud — is perhaps the most salient .
The computer maker notes that Senior Psion Product Manager , Herb Turzer , swore to the USPTO in 2006 that his company was still using the netbook trademark " in commerce on or in connection with all goods listed " in its registration .
Turzer also stated at the time that Psion " has used [ its ] trademark in commerce for five ( 5 ) consecutive years after the date of registration . "
Psion may have actually filed for the trademark in 1996 , but it was only awarded the mark in 2000 .
Dell argues that Psion 's discontinuation of its Windows CE netbook in 2003 constitutes fraud on the part of Turzer 's statements .
Dell 's third argument is genericness , and it is n't hard to see its foundation .
Netbooks — the ones people actually started buying , anyway — started appearing in 2007 with Asus ' Eee PC .
Other manufacturers , like Dell , Saumsung , Acer , HP , and even Sony , have since followed suit with their own netbooks , but the generic use of the term may even stretch back to 2006's OLPC .
Psion did not respond to Ars Technica 's request for comment on Dell 's petition , though it is surely not skipping in the streets .
The company has so far shown no signs of backing down from its threats of " last resort " litigation , and it even links one mobile blogger in its Trademark Statement ( PDF link ) who is on board with finding a new name for ultra-compact computers .
For now , however , notice and trial dates have been posted ( PDF link ) .
Psion has until March 30 , 2009 to respond to Dell 's petition .
Some say he can encode a stack of DVDs in seconds using only his teeth , and that he can command an army of millions with just one NFO .
All that we know is he 's called aXXo and he / she / they have some security advice for the worshippers .
The relatively silent aXXo has appeared during the last few days .
Speaking with the users of Mininova , he outlined some advice to help mitigate the effects of what he believes to be a potential security risk .
The problem could cause downloads to slow down or even worse , he warns .
Not so long ago we posted a technique to bring dead torrents back to life .
Basically it involves adding new tracker URLs to an existing torrent so that it ’s possible to track the same content on multiple trackers .
However , it seems some people have been adding other trackers to new aXXo torrents as a matter of course ( probably to try and speed up downloads ) , with some unpredictable results .
“ I ’ve seen on the mininova ’s comments section some users telling each other to add trackers to a torrent .
To add trackers to a torrent that are not included in the original release is the worst thing users can do , ” said aXXo commenting on one of his latest releases .
“ Those trackers do n’t know which are the real chunks of the file nor who have the right ones , the information they send to the clients is wrong and the download will be fucked up . ”
If it ’s not quite clear what aXXo is driving at from the above , it becomes clearer later on .
He explains that other tracker URLs that people add to torrents may not be tracking exactly the right content .
Peers there could deliberately send bad data in order to hinder people ’s downloads , a tactic favored by anti-piracy companies such as MediaDefender .
Their effectiveness with these methods on various torrent sites became public last year .
“.. there are ‘ specialists ’ manipulating torrents out there , ” says aXXo while mentioning no names , warning , “ ISPs nice letters are ready for those peers who follow that ‘ technique ’ . ”
“ That ’s my advice , ” says aXXo .
“ Take it or leave it . ”

Bank accused of fraud gave big bucks to Congress Rachel Oswald
Published : Wednesday February 18 , 2009
Print This Email This Congress members skirt calls from Raw ; Stanford Financial PAC gave $ 128,000 in 2008
With a financial crisis that President Obama warns could lead to catastrophe for this nation one would think policitians would be quick to return any money that could be viewed as having anything to do with the financial shenanigans that brought about this mess in the first place .
Last year , employees of Stanford Financial Group , whose founder billionaire , Sir. Robert Allen Stanford , has been charged with massive , ongoing fraud by the Security and Exchange Commission , gave more than $ 100,000 in campaign contributions to Congress at the end of 2008 .
It is not yet known how many Congress members will be returning those contributions .
Requests for comment from RawStory on Tuesday to a number of Congressional offices have yet to be returned .
This could mean that either Democrats and Republicans are ducking the question or they need more time to weigh the pluses and minuses of returning the donations .
At least one senator , Bill Nelson , will likely be returning the campaign contributions .
Said Nelson through his spokesman Dan McLaughlin to The Orlando Sentinel , " Based on the fact that Mr. Stanford has been indicted in a fraud case , I will give to charity any campaign contributions from him or his employees . "
Stanford was charged by securities regulators on Tuesday , according to The Financial Times with massive , ongoing fraud operated through his Antigua - based offshore bank .
The Stanford Financial Group Company Employees Political Action Committee gave $ 128,000 to both Republican and Democratic campaign committees in 2008 , according to records from the Federal Election Commission .
Among the highlights of the many contributions are $ 5,000 to the campaign of House Minority Leader John Boehner and $ 3,000 to the campaign of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Asked by RawStory if Rep. Boehner would be returning his campaign contributions from the PAC , Michael Steele , press secretary for Boehner said ,  This is the first I m hearing of it .
Well find out .
The large bulk of the contributions came in the latter half of 2008 , not coincidentally when Congress was considering passage of the controversial $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program .
On a single day , Oct. 10 , $ 61,700 was contributed by the STAN - PAC .
Seven days earlier President George W. Bush had signed the financial systems bailout into law .
Calls on the same matter to Reids office and to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee also went unreturned .
Since 2000 , Robert Allen Stanford , his wife and company gave $ 2.2 million in political contributions 
$ 1.7 million to Democratic candidates and committees  according to a review by Politico of Federal Election Commission records .
The most recent donation on record was $ 300,000 from Stanford Financial Group to the 527 group , the Democratic Governors Association .
Reports Politico
" Other beneficiaries included the Democrats  congressional campaign committees , which received $ 1.2 million over the years , and their Republican counterparts , which got $ 322,000 , including a $ 28,500 personal donation last year to the National Republican Congressional Committee . "
According to OpenSecrets.org , since 1989 the top recipients of cash from Stanford Financial in the current Congress include Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) , who received $ 45,900 ; Rep. Pete Sessions ( R - Texas ) , who collected $ 41,375 ; and Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , who brought in $ 28,150 .
According to Financial Times , the SEC is charging that Stanford International Bank in St. Johns , Antigua , one of several companies run by Stanford , sold approximately $ 8 billion in certificates of deposits by promising improbably and unsubstantiated high interest rates . 
Many of the politicians who received campaign contributions are at the heads of powerful Congressional committees that oversee financial matters deemed crucial to the banking industry .
Charles Rangel , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , received $ 5,000 from the PAC and Barney Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , received $ 1,000 .
West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller , who is chairman of the Senates Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation , received $ 5,000 .
Rahm Emanuel , Presidents Barack Obamas chief of staff , received $ 3,000 from the PAC in 2008 , when he was the third most powerful Democrat in the House .
Interestingly Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi , did not receive any money .
Stanford Financial also spent a significant chunk of change in lobbying fees in 2008 .
According to the Senate Office of Public Records , the company paid out $ 625,000 to the Ben Barnes Group , the lobbyist firm started by former Texas Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes .
Sir. Robert Allen Stanford is also from Texas .
Reported OpenSecrets.org , " Stanford Financial Group has spent a total of $ 4.8 million on lobbying efforts since 1999 , primarily on issues related to money laundering , financial services and banking .
Last year the firm 's lobbying spiked by more than 300 percent , totaling $ 2.2 million . "
Wednesday morning ABC
News reported that Federal authorities say they do not know the current whereabouts of the CEO .
Calls to the Ben Barnes Group on what kind of lobbying services they provided to Stanford Financial have not been returned .

The arrest of Illinois Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich on Tuesday marked the latest in a series of scandals involving Democratic politicians -- an ironic turn for a party that won control of Congress in 2006 in part by saying it would end a “ culture of corruption ” under Republican leadership .
Democrats also highlighted Republican ethical problems in the successful bid to expand their congressional majorities this year , and Barack Obama made government transparency and a crackdown on lobbyist influence a theme of his presidential campaign .
The corruption charges against Blagojevich come as one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress , Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , is under investigation by a House ethics panel .
The panel is looking at Rangel ’s occupation of several rent - controlled apartments in Manhattan , whether he failed to pay taxes on an offshore rental property and other questions .
On Tuesday , it announced that the investigation was expanding to include allegations that Rangel supported a tax break for an oil drilling company in exchange for a donation to a school that would bear his name .

Democratic Rep. William J. Jefferson of Louisiana is awaiting trial on charges of bribery , money laundering and misusing his congressional office .
He has pleaded not guilty .
On Saturday , Jefferson was ousted from his House seat in a runoff election .
Earlier this year , Democratic Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York resigned after revelations that he was a regular customer of an elite call - girl ring .
The allegations against Blagojevich -- including that he solicited favors to influence his decision about who should replace Obama in the Senate -- were shocking to Democrats .
“ It straightened my hair , ” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - Fla . ) .

Democrats said they hoped the political fallout for their party would be limited , but they acknowledged the developments gave Republicans a political target during Obama ’s transition .
“ Do I think Republicans will try to make something of this ? ” asked Rep. George Miller ( D - Martinez ) .
“ Of course . ”
The new chairman of the GOP ’s Senate campaign committee was quick to respond to the Blagojevich news .
“ Every Democratic and labor union official , whether in Illinois or in their national organizations , who has spoken with the governor or his aides about this U.S. Senate seat should step forward and immediately make public the full details of those conversations and meetings , ” said Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) .
“ The stain of corruption needs to be lifted from this selection process and the public trust restored . ”

Obama said he had made no contact with the governor about his Senate replacement , but he said little else because the investigation was ongoing .
The political risk for Democrats is that voters will be as repulsed by the ethics problems as they were by the scandals that contributed to the defeat of former GOP Reps .
Tom DeLay of Texas , Bob Ney of Ohio , Mark Foley of Florida and others .
Democrats won those and other House seats in districts that had been reliably Republican , and the party made ethics an issue in the 2006 elections that delivered control of Congress to Democrats .
But Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( D - Md. ) , chairman of the committee responsible for helping elect Democrats to the House , said he thought the political damage would be limited to those engaged in wrongdoing because the party leadership had made ethics reform a priority .

By contrast , he said , DeLay and other Republican leaders systematically built ties between the party hierarchy and lobbyists .
Democrats hope the Blagojevich scandal will be dealt with quickly and decisively to avoid broader aspersions being cast on the party .
“ You want these guys over the edge of the ship as fast as you can push them , ” said Peter Fenn , a Democratic political consultant .
“ This is something that Obama is going to have to be dealing with pretty fast . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) recently said she expected the Rangel investigation to wrap up by the end of this session of Congress .
Now , with the inquiry expanding , it seems more likely to run into next year .

Republicans have called on Rangel to step down as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , a panel that will have a big role in writing the economic recovery legislation that Obama has made a priority .

I had the chance to do a brief hands - on with the Kindle 2 after its introduction today ; in contrast to last time around , review copies were not available to the press .
I 've gone on record with a list of complaints about the first generation version , and suggested that there may have been little Amazon could do , given its reliance on E - Ink for that hardware .
It appears that E - Ink has come through for them in a big way , and the Kindle 2 is a far better device as a result .
The new version displays more shades of grey than were previously possible , and Amazon has paired that with a set of updated fonts to make the text significantly crisper and easier to read .
But it 's the speed of the display that makes everything different .
Amazon claims a 20 percent improvement in page flips , but it 's clear that the operating system is very capable of redrawing only subsets of the screen — perhaps the software is smarter about that than it was previously , it 's impossible to tell .
In any case , the result is that anything done on the screen is very much faster — moving the cursor , selecting text , typing , menus , you name it .
It 's really hard to convey just how much more responsive the device feels .
The new layout of controls on Kindle 2
Because Amazon can do more on the screen , it was able to revamp a lot of the rest of the interface .
The LCD strip on the right side of Kindle 1 , which was used for selecting text and menu items , and sporadically for indicating progress , is gone , and good riddance .
In killing it , Amazon has gotten rid of some of the worst of its interface inconsistencies , and more closely linked controlling the device to its primary screen .
The faster display has allowed a cursor to be moved around the screen , and highlighting of selected text , items , and menus to be performed there , as well , all of which makes for a better interface .
Since the controls can now operate on the two dimensions of the screen , the click wheel that controlled the first generation device is gone , replaced by a five - way nub controller that acts much like the nipple in the keyboard of the old Thinkpads .
It 's a bit small for my thumbs , but I expect that longer periods of use would get me comfortable with it .
Physically , the most striking aspect of the device is its thickness — it really is remarkably thin , and the sleek metal back ( reminiscent of the first - generation iPhone ) is very appealing .
It still feels quite robust , however .
Amazon clearly listened to its customers ' feedback when it comes to the large buttons that graced the sides of the original Kindle , which made it far too easy to accidentally advance a page .
They 're gone , and the smaller buttons that replace them pivot inwards , meaning that grabbing the edge of the device can't advance a page , even if you hit the smaller buttons .
The downside of this is that the screen , largely unchanged in size , really appears to be swimming in a sea of white plastic now , since there are wide margins between it and the edge on the upper third of the device .
The bottom quarter still contains the keyboard .
When asked about an on - screen keyboard , an Amazon staffer said that the company thinks on - screen keyboards cause more problems than they solve , especially given it 's the primary reading surface , so that 's unlikely to go away .
That said , it did get a facelift for Kindle 2 .
Because of the faster screen , characters like punctuation and symbols are selected on - screen using the pointer after hitting an Alt button , meaning each key only handles one character now , which gives it a cleaner look .
The layout of keys , however — a QWERTY arrangement but with the keys in vertical columns , instead of offset between rows — left me completely lost .
Having gone from typing on an iPhone to this keyboard , which requires a fair bit of pressure before a physical click is felt , was also disorienting .
The backspace and return keys were also on top of each other , which caused me other problems .
Unlike the pointer , I 'm not sure I could get used to this with time ; in my short hands on , I really hated it .
Stylish brushed metal appears on the side you do n't look at .
As we mentioned before , a lot more action happens on screen , and the software has been updated in many ways to reflect that .
Some of the content , like newspaper articles , has also seen an update to make it easier to navigate and get a quick feel for a story .
Music and Web browsing still reside in the " Experimental " section , and are joined by the new text - to - speech feature .
The biggest feature , software - wise , seems to be the new , " Whispersync " feature , which can be triggered with a menu command .
This will get both a user 's content and location within it — book and page — coordinated between different Kindles .
We 've confirmed that it has been added to Kindle 1 devices through a firmware update today .
Jeff Bezos hinted in his product intro that it will eventually work with content " on other mobile devices , " but my attempts to get anyone from Amazon to talk about that went nowhere , or rather led into a thicket of answers about how the company was n't ready to make forward - looking statements .
Overall , I have to say that the Kindle 2 is a far superior device to the first iteration , and really shows an attention to detail that , based on the earlier device , it was n't clear that Amazon had in it .
More significantly , perhaps , is the fact that the company has clearly made sensible fixes to many of the problems , which demonstrates a clear commitment to listening to its customers .
The changes give me hope that , when the hardware 's ready , the remaining issues ( primarily the keyboard and the small screen ) will be fixed .
It makes me anxious to see what 's in store for Kindle 3 .
A new study has found that laughing gas , a common anaesthetic used by dentists , increases the vividness of imagination and also increases suggestibility , making people slightly more likely to experience hypnosis - like suggestions .
The study , just published in the medical journal Psychopharmacology , stems from the informal observations of dentists that patients under laughing gas ( nitrous oxide ) sedation are particularly suggestible and the researchers aimed to test this out in more detail .
The researchers randomised patients at a dental surgery to either receive a nitrous oxide and oxygen mix , or just oxygen , with the patients not knowing which they were receiving .
Two weeks later they were invited back and given which ever type of gas mix they had n’t already had .
While inhaling each gas mix , the participants were asked to complete a measure of imaginative ability , rating the clarity and vividness of their visual imagery , as well as being given various suggestions – without the hypnotic induction – from the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale .
This includes suggestions that your hands might move of their own accord , to suggested temporary paralysis , to a suggestion to experience hallucinated sounds – to name but a few .
The researchers found that nitrous oxide boosted imaginative ability considerably , and increased suggestibility modestly but reliably .
The paper discusses the small but interesting literature on which drugs affect suggestibility , and reviews some of the past studies which have tested some quite surprising substances in this way :
Little research has investigated the effects of other drugs upon suggestibility in a controlled manner .
Sjoberg and Hollister ( 1965 ) administered lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , mescaline and psilocybin separately and in combination to participants and measured imaginative suggestibility before and after drug administration .
Gibson et al ( 1977 ) measured the effect of benzodiazepine administration upon hypnotic suggestibility , and Kelly et al ( 1978 ) tested the effect of cannabis intoxication upon the imaginative suggestibility of participants initially scoring low to medium on a standardised scale .
Details of these studies and the resulting changes in suggestibility are given in Table 2 [ see further down this page for a web version ] .
The greatest changes in suggestibility , in order of decreasing size , are evident after administration of nitrous oxide , cannabis , LSD , mescaline , combination of [ LSD + mescaline+psilocybin ] and diazepam .
So it seems that nitrous oxide may have a particular suggestibility boosting effect .
By the way , the study was led by psychologist Matt Whalley , who also runs the excellent Hypnosis and Suggestion website , undoubtedly the best internet resource for scientific information on hypnosis .

I am standing in a wood with a tall man and a dead pheasant .
There is blood everywhere : on my shoes , my hands , my face .
Why am I here ?
Because the man - his name is Leon Durbin - is preparing me for the apocalypse , now .
What would happen if you awoke one morning and everyone was dead ?
Or if , less melodramatically , the world as we know it - and our teetering financial systems - ceased to function ?
What if you awoke to find your bubble - wrapped , gilded life was over , and for good ?
Could you survive ?
Could I ?
I am an urban girl .
I have no skills except whingeing and bingeing .
I can barely open a packet of Hobnobs without an explosive device .
But , unlike you , doomed and dying reader , I have decided to prepare for The End , and I am prepared to share the life - saving knowledge I will accrue .
This is your cut - out - and - keep guide to the apocalypse .
Put it in a drawer .
One day you may need it .
So you wake up ; everyone is dead .
For the purpose of this exercise , imagine it 's like Survivors , the cheap BBC rendition of the apocalypse , where a plague wipes out humanity and then everyone is mildly annoyed that the trains are delayed .
We could imagine total financial or ecological collapse leading to the failure of social structures , but let 's say it 's a plague .
So , how long can you stay in your house ?
The answer is : not long .
According to the people at the National Grid , the electricity will stop .
So will the water .
These systems have buttons .
Buttons need fingers .
Fingers need people who are alive .
You have a day , maybe two , of electricity .
Then you will be in darkness , with no way of washing your face .
What should you do ?
You can steal food from supermarkets but the rotting corpses on the floor of Sainsbury 's will be fetid fonts of infection .
And if you try to sit out the plague in your home , you could burn or drown .
After a lightning strike , fires will begin and they will not stop .
And if you live in London , the Thames barrier will fail without electricity and the low - lying areas of the city will flood .
So you have to leave .
But where do you go ?
The apocalyptic norm - see 28 Days Later and Survivors - is for survivors to sit in desirable country mansions , eat tinned tomatoes , develop post - traumatic psychosis and shoot each other .
Never in any apocalyptic scenario in any movie I have seen - and I have seen them all - does anyone try to live off the land .
They prefer to feed on the crumbs of the lost civilisation .
It never works .
How can you rebuild civilisation with tinned tomatoes ?
You need to grow your own food .
But where ?
I choose Devon .
It is warm and wet and fertile , and I have been happy there .
There are cows .
This is where I would live off the land , but I need to learn how .
This thinking has led me to Durbin and the dead bird .
Durbin is tall and tweedy .
He is the sort of man who keeps firewood kindling in his pocket , just in case .
He owns Wildwood Bushcraft , a company that explains how to survive if you are dropped into the wilderness with no supplies , no warning and no clue .
Durbin leads me through the spindly , sleeping trees , pointing out different kinds of branch and bush , and their uses .
According to him , the wood is a shop that will give you everything you need .
" Willow bark can be boiled to relieve a headache , " he says .
" Yew is for making long bows .
Oak is for shelters .
Ash is for tool handles .
Have you ever had a beech - leaf sandwich ? " I do n't bother replying .
To be competent in bushcraft , you have to be well equipped : before you leave the city , stop for a saw , chisel , spade , axe and hunting knife .
Durbin has them all .
They poke out of his rucksack in a manly fashion .
We arrive at a clearing and Durbin demonstrates how to light a fire .
He places a small block of wood on the ground and puts a wooden stake on it , point down .
He takes a bow , made of wood and string , places it round the stake and , when he moves the bow in a sideways motion , the stake rotates very fast .
Its friction with the block of wood magically creates a pile of super - hot matter .
It can ignite dry hay or bark .
This creates a conflagration that can light a fire .
How will I get water ?
Durbin runs bushcraft weekends for angry executives here , so he knows where it is .
" Water , " I cry , lunging at a small stream .
" Careful , " says Durbin .
" We have to filter the water with a sock full of sand .
Then we have to bring it to a rolling boil . "
Why a sock ?
He ignores me .
Food is harder .
It is winter and the countryside is closed for repairs .
My two main vegetarian foods , Durbin explains , will be burdock root and hazelnut .
Both are high - energy .
You can make chips out of burdock and you can boil , mash and dry hazelnut to produce a repulsive kind of biscuit .
Durbin picks up a spade and starts digging for burdock .
He finds some , but it 's rotten .
" Winter , " he sighs .
" Hmmm . "
So , with a fiendish flourish , I produce a dead pheasant from my handbag .
I had spent the day before negotiating with the Guardian as to the legal and moral implications of murdering a rabbit for the purposes of this article .
Finally we had compromised , and I had gone to a posh butcher 's in Mayfair and bought this beautiful pheasant for £ 3.50 .
Durbin looks impressed .
" You have to pull off its head , " he says .
" Just twist it . "
I close my eyes and twist .
The head comes off easily ; it feels like wringing out a slightly damp scarf .
Then Durbin makes a hole in the pheasant 's bottom and I stick my hand up and clutch everything inside .
Out comes a squelchy mass of once - living flesh .
Durbin grabs the heart and cuts it open .
" Very nutritious , " he says .
I am slightly sick in my mouth .
I pluck , and soon I have a pile of bloodstained feathers - and a nude bird .
Durbin sticks it on a spit over the fire .
When it is cooked , we eat it .
It tastes slightly of excrement but I still feel strangely empowered .
It was much easier than I thought it would be , to rip this bird apart .
I now have bloodlust .
I ask Durbin how to trap animals .
I could theoretically shoot them , but trapping is more suitable for the lazy or incompetent survivor .
He looks slightly nervous .
" It 's illegal , " he says slowly .
But I prod and he tells me about different types of trap .
I could try the pit trap , he says , where you dig a hole in the forest floor , line it with sharpened stakes and camouflage it .
It is for large animals - deer , wild boar , parents , other journalists .
There is also the deadfall trap , which is for small animals .
They saunter over a trigger mechanism , and a lump of wood falls on their head .
Bon appetit and ha ha .
But what would I eat if I could n't trap ?
" Bugs , " says Durbin happily .
" Worms . "
There are 40 calories in a worm , apparently ; this is the equivalent of two Maltesers .
" Or snails , " he adds .
" But quarantine the snail for three days before you eat it .
It may have eaten poisonous plants , and you will have to wait until it expels them . "
Now you need shelter .
If I had the choice , I would probably look for a small stone cottage - hardy and easy to maintain - but if I am foraging , I have to go to where the food is .
So Durbin shows me how to make a survival shelter .
He hurls logs up against a tree trunk , and covers them with a foot of leaves and bracken and mud .
" It is waterproof , " he says .
I climb in and lie down .
It is a hole that only a troll could love .
But there they are , the four pillars of survival : food , water , fire and shelter .
The next day , I go to Pullabrook Wood in Devon to practise my skills .
It was easy to survive yesterday , with Durbin standing by .
Can I cope alone ?
Pullabrook is a lovely wood , administered by the Woodland Trust .
It is full of happy Tories and happy Labradors .
But now I have my own mini-apocalypse .
I fail at bow drilling .
I find a stream , but a happy Tory says the water is poisonous , even if filtered by sock .
Why ?
" Because sheep droppings have contaminated it , " he says .
Death by Sheep is only slightly behind Death by Snail in the encyclopaedia of embarrassing ways to die .
The first shelter I build is too small for me to enter .
My second shelter collapses .
I decide to abandon bushcraft .
I will try my hand at farming .
Woman can not live on worm alone .
So , a few days later , I am standing inside an Iron Age roundhouse at Butser Ancient Farm in Hampshire .
Butser is a project that re-enacts Iron Age life .
The roundhouse is huge and round and dim .
I feel a bit as if I am standing inside a giant breast .
Steve Dyer is the archaeological director .
He is tall and red-faced , with a frizzy white beard .
" Roundhouses are easy to make , " he says , waving his arms .
He points out two animal skulls , tied to the entrance posts .
Is that a cow 's skull ?
Dyer grimaces politely .
" It 's a horse , " he says , before proceeding to tell me how to make a roundhouse .
The ingredients are : 27 large oak trees , 60 small oak trees , 100 hazel trees , 100 ash trees , wheat straw for thatching , and animal hair , clay , manure , soil and water for the walls .
You will also need animals .
Dyer escorts me to his pigpen to meet two nameless pigs .
To domesticate animals , he says , you just have to enclose them in smaller and smaller areas .
Provide them with what they need - food , water and attention - and they will obey you .
You can then eat them , and peel them , and tan their hides for soft furnishings .
But beware of sheep , he says , waving a bright red finger .
" I know this guy called Si , " he says .
" He approached a frisky ram .
It jumped up and broke his nose . "
I am back at Death by Sheep .
I telephone the psychologist Cecelia De Felice .
I want to know if I will go insane in my new one - woman world , especially when faced with tasks such as chopping down 27 large oaks .
" You will be in a state of trauma , " she agrees .
" You will quickly become lonely and paranoid .
It is possible you will have a breakdown . "
And if I meet other survivors ?
Be cautious , she advises .
" They too will be lonely and paranoid .
Of course you are stronger in a group .
But you do not know whether they will help you or just steal your resources .
Trust no one . "
I am ( vaguely ) confident I will not starve .
But there is one other thing I am sweating over : nuclear power stations .
Professor Alan Weisman wrote The World Without Us , a description of what he believes would happen to Earth if we all vanished .
I call him .
He says I am right to worry .
Why ?
Because most nuclear plants are water - cooled .
Water , he explains , in a dry , calm voice , needs to circulate around the reactors , or they will explode .
If there were no humans to operate it , the plant would shut down automatically , and the water would be cooled with diesel fuel .
For about a week .
Then the heat from the reactor would evaporate and expose the core .
" It will either melt down or burst into very radioactive flames , " he says .
So what would you do , Professor Weisman ?
" I would probably go to Canada , " he says .
" There are n't many nuclear power stations in Canada . "
So , it comes to this .
No matter how hard you try , Britain will probably become a nuclear wasteland .
The snails that are your lunch will either die , or look very weird .
So , again , what to do ?
My considered advice is this .
You , Guardian reader , need to begin building a boat - a sailing ship , actually - to take you to - yes , Canada .
Before you leave the city you should pause at a library and steal the entire boat - making and maintenance shelf .
Canada may be your only hope of salvation .
And that is as fitting an obituary for our civilisation as I can type .
In The End , it turns out you do n't just have to be the heroine of Survivors .
You need to bloody well be Noah too .
Happy apocalypse .
It 's not all bad :
Fun things you could do after the apocalypse
• Pop into the National Gallery and take Jan Van Eyck 's Portrait of a Man off the wall .
( If you have no taste , take a Renoir . )
The Van Eyck is hanging in the Sainsbury Wing .
If you want to preserve it properly , Thomas Almeroth - Williams of the National Gallery suggests you store it in a slate mine , where the temperature and humidity levels are perfect for its conservation .
• Go to the British Library and help yourself to one of its two copies of Shakespeare 's First Folio .
One is in a box in a strong room under the library floor ; the other is in a glass case in the Treasure Room .
If you want to preserve it properly , Helen Shenton of the British Library suggests you store it in a cool , dark place , and watch it carefully for infestations by animals or fungi .
Dust regularly .
• Steal the crown jewels .
If you can .
" There are contingency plans in place in event of a power failure , " says a Royal Palaces spokesperson , " so the crown jewels should remain safe . "
Really ?
To preserve them properly , do nothing .
A diamond is for ever .
• Invade the News of the World - it's in Wapping - and read all its secret files .
Then break into M15 .
It 's on Millbank .
Read all its secret files too .
Oh , no !
She was murdered !
I knew it !
• Go and stand on the stage at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane .
Skip over the bodies of the dead actors .
Re-enact the whole of Oliver !
The vital skills you will need
How to make bread
I type this in full because I want bread at The End , and I want you to have it too ( should you survive ) .
So , clear the land , turn the soil over to create furrows , take seed from any wheat growing wild , sow it 20 cm apart and kick the soil over .
Make sure that the birds do n't eat the seed .
Stop browsing animals by hedging the field off and root out weeds .
When the corn is ripe , thresh it by hitting it with a stick and mill it by rubbing it between large stones .
Add the flour to water to make dough .
Stick it in a pan on the fire .
Result ?
Wholemeal flatbread !
How to make sanitary products and toilet paper
Find some sphagnum moss and use that .
It is very spongy and it contains iodine , so it is slightly antiseptic .
How to eat snails
Always , always quarantine snails before eating them .
Take the snail and put it where there is nothing for it to eat .
Ignore its cries of hunger , leave for three days and then consume .
How to purify water
Collect the water from the purest source available , ideally a spring , minimising sediment and avoiding chemical contamination .
Filter it through a sock full of sand .
Sterilise the water by bringing it to a rolling boil for a few seconds .
How to clay bake a fish
Wrap the fish in large leaves , tying up the parcel with nettle stalk .
Dig for clay in the earth .
After combining the clay with water , cover the fish with a centimetre of clay , leaving no cracks .
Scrape a shallow pit in the centre of the fire and lay the fish in it .
Cover the fish with embers .
After an hour , remove the fish and crack the outer shell open .
The fish should be perfectly cooked .
How to remove the skin from a cow
You can kill a cow by strangulation apparently , although I have never met anyone who has done it .
Or you can cut its throat , or spear it through the heart .
Split the cow along its belly from the groin to the throat .
Remove the internal organs .
Hang the cow up by its hooves for several days to let the blood run out .
Cows are heavy , so do not attempt to do this alone .
To take the skin off , slide a blade or a sharp stone between the skin and the flesh .
Once you have inserted the tool a little way , you can just peel the skin off .
How to shoot a deer with a bow and arrow
Deer are sensitive to human noise and smell .
If you stomp through the wood with a bow and arrow you will never find one .
Find out where the deer are going to be - they often walk the same way to the same place .
Camouflage your scent , be quiet and do not move .
When you see a deer , shoot it from 20 m away .
You ideally need a kill shot , eg in a lung .
You do n't want to hit it in the bottom , because it will run off and you wo n't get your dinner .

Cuyahoga County officials will learn from state officials how to apply for a share of President Barack Obama 's economic stimulus plan on Thursday during a conference call with other officials from around Ohio .
Ohioans certain to see some stimulus dollars
More on stimulus plan
Cuyahoga County Administrator Jim McCafferty and Commissioner Tim Hagan presented the county 's $ 420 million wish list to Obama 's administration and congressional representatives during a visit to Washington , D.C. , last week .
They are appealing to Obama and the state officials who will disburse the funds for help with projects they say would stimulate the economy , improve Cleveland 's world - class health care institutions , improve infrastructure and help those in need .
Until they get the briefing on how the state will hand out the money , the wish list is more of an informal appeal than an official request , McCafferty said .
McCafferty said the projects are in line with the priorities outlined by the president , and that the county deserves the money because local tax dollars have already been invested in all of them .
Here 's Cuyahoga County 's wish list for federal money :
• $ 187 million to complete the Towpath Trail , relocate the port , stabilize the Riverbed Road hillside , advance the Green Bulkhead Project , redevelop the lakefront and create a bridge from the Towpath trailhead to Wendy Park .
• $ 108 million to redevelop brownfields , improve infrastructure , replace the Inner Belt Bridge , improve the sewer system , combat the foreclosure crisis , provide universal preschool and help the needy .
• $ 77 million to help with the medical mart and Convention Center , invest in new health care businesses and technologies , train health care workers and support MetroHealth Medical Center .
• $ 48.3 million to put wind turbines in Lake Erie , improve the energy efficiency of county buildings , train workers for clean - energy jobs and develop clean energy businesses .

A 56 - year - old American athlete claims to have become the first woman on record to swim the Atlantic .
Jennifer Figge took 24 days to swim from the Cape Verde islands off Africa to Trinidad .
The exact distance she covered has yet to be calculated .
She swam inside a cage to protect her from sharks .
Figge , who had originally planned to make landfall in the Bahamas , now plans to finish by swimming from Trinidad to the British Virgin Islands .
She first dreamed of swimming across the Atlantic Ocean as a little girl .
Looking back , I would n't have it any other way
Jennifer Figge
Each day she would spend up to eight hours in the water at a stretch before returning to her support boat .
Crew members would throw the athlete energy drinks as she swam along , if it was too stormy divers would deliver them in person .
She saw pilot whales , turtles , and dolphins , but no sharks .
" I was never scared , " she told the Associated Press news agency .
" Looking back , I would n't have it any other way .
I can always swim in a pool . "
Jennifer Figge 's journey comes 10 years after a French swimmer , Benoit Lecomte , made the first known solo trans -Atlantic swim covering 6,400 km ( 4,000 miles ) in 73 days .
Figge had planned to swim 3,380 km ( 2,100 miles ) , but she was blown off course and reached Trinidad rather than the Bahamas .

At times , it gets tiring to read the number of pile - on posts and comments written about AOL .
At this point , AOL ’s destiny is in their own hands , and we will see what the future holds for them as they hunker down and focus on 2009 financial performance ( as we all are ) .
One thing hit the wires yesterday , however , that caught my eye .
It was a post by Heather Hopkins about the latest traffic statistics about MapQuest and Google Maps , and where both where from an aggregate traffic perspective .
As backdrop , here are the latest stats from Hitwise on the comparative market share ( based on UVs ) for MapQuest and Google Maps :
As the chart shows , 2008 was a seminal year for Google Maps .
Their share gain , regardless of whose stats you use ( Comscore , et al ) has been nothing short of tremendous .
Unfortunately , that in large part has come out of the hide of the incumbent , MapQuest , an AOL property .
I have always been a cheerleader for MapQuest - the role they played on web - enabled consumer behavior change in the 90’s ca n’t be denied .
Seeing us reach a tipping point in the US market , in terms of share shift , really pains me .
I think there are a number of self - inflicted wounds that they need to address , but I also think MapQuest represents an opportunity to be a focused poster child of business transformation in 2009 , and I will share my thoughts on that a bit later .
First , let ’s deal with the pain .
It stares me in the face each time I use MapQuest as a consumer service .
Let ’s look at the results of a request for directions on MapQuest and Google Maps .
Here ’s the MapQuest experience ( rendering for a 1024 by 768 display , the usual web design guideline ) :
Now , let ’s see the same results from Google Maps :
This is part of the long - term issue with MapQuest :
At some point along the journey , it has lost its way , in terms of the primary mission it is meant to serve .
It is all about simple , informative directions .
The current experience is , as a friend of mine says , a dog ’s breakfast .
I am not sure what my eye is supposed to be drawn to .
It sure the heck is n’t the actual directions - they barely begin above the fold .
This looks like a misapplied implementation of a tactical focus on short - term revenue ( e.g. , note the big slug of non-relevant sponsored links for Florida and Cancun smack dab in the middle of the page ) .
Now , look at the Google Maps display - it is all about consumer payoff .
I see the turn - by - turn directions and the map rendered above the fold , and the first sponsored link is on the left rail after the directions .
I do understand the case for monetization of traffic , but when that starts materially impairing the consumer experience , you start putting the franchise at risk .
MapQuest has reached that point .
Unfortunately , in large part , AOL has its hands tied about changing course , in terms of how the property is managed .
The market is hyper - focused on AOL ’s near - term financial trajectory , and that means running the business for cash .
I am sure there are a number of smart people at AOL who recognize the issues facing MapQuest , but they do n’t have the latitude to consider strategic investment in the property .
That ’s why I think structural opportunities are the right near - term focus :
It looks like , from the press over the last year , the financial dialogs with third parties have been focused on large , macro- sized chunks of AOL ( e. , g. , the access business and Earthlink , the ad and audience businesses and Yahoo , etc. ) .
Unfortunately , the September market collapse took the wind out of the sales of lots of M&A dialogs , especially in the high - multiple sectors like technology .
Is the real 2009 opportunity for AOL to take great , more focused , franchise properties like MapQuest , and post their first win in creating a next - gen version of AOL , perhaps manifested as a holding company sitting on top of material stakes in properties spun out of the mothership ?
In examining strategic options , let ’s be sure to give credit for what MapQuest still is , in terms of aggregate traffic and as a brand .
It is an attractive franchise with real potential , but it needs the capital to play offense in the space .
With the billions of private equity currently parked on the sidelines , a major property like MapQuest could attract a good deal of interest .
I would engage a team today focused on a mission to actively pursue strategy options for MapQuest , in parallel to whatever other efforts are underway .
Now , assuming an option to infuse some strategic capital in MapQuest exists , what exactly should be done to change the slope of growth line ?
I think there are a variety of things to pursue :
1 . Fix the consumer experience ASAP - make consumers love MapQuest again
2 . Find your voice in the market - maybe strive to be “ the most accurate directions on the web ” .
That takes work , and things like Google ’s ability for me to submit address corrections to their database means your work is cut out for you , but that is a real pillar of value the consumer market might understand .
3 . Find the platform play where you can win .
Maybe that starts with being the champion of things like OpenStreetMap .
4 . Find ways to get more organic traffic .
Over 60 % of Google Maps ’ traffic came from Google .
They have a natural advantage here .
That does n’t mean there are n’t creative SEO / organic traffic opportunities .
You know the mid and long tail of popular physical addresses and locations .
What next - gen location - centric pages could you generate that takes in all the great geo - coded data being added to the web daily ?
5 . Push the envelope more on your mobile experiences
It is not enough to just have sites render well on a phone ’s browser .
They need to exploit GPS , accelerometers , electronic compasses , etc. , to deliver a competitive experience .
6 . Find the right local review play to leverage .
One of the biggest opportunities discussed over the years about MapQuest has been local search , and today that means access to local and location - contextual reviews .
Find out how to have a great horse in that race .
The sector does n’t have to be ceded to Yelp .
Local reviews are , at some level , fundamentally broken ( poor at long - tail items , subject to vendor rating spam , etc. ) .
There is a good niche acquisition opportunity in your future to jumpstart things here , in my opinion .
7 . Be the first to deliver a free Telenav - level consumer experience ( real - time , text - to - speech , turn by turn ) - that does means addressing the current Navteq pricing practices ( hence the push to accelerate the open source mapping efforts ) .
These are just a few ideas .
I am sure people at AOL have a lot more .
The key is finding the structure to allow these ideas to be pursued .
The goal is simple - do what it takes make MapQuest the property it deserves to be .
Bletchley Park is unique .
It combines a key role in modern history along with being the birthplace of the computer .
I cannot think of a place more worthy of our interest , our support and our government 's support .
Please join me in raising awareness of the fundamental importance of Bletchley Park and in saving Bletchley Park so that it will still be there for future generations to visit , appreciate and understand .
Bletchley Park is also the birthplace of the computer .
The world 's first programmable , digital , electronic computer : Colossus was invented and built at Bletchley Park during World War Two to speed the reading of encrypted German messages .
Welcome to the saving Bletchley Park website .
Thousands of people worked at Bletchley Park during World War Two to decode messages that the German forces transmitted , most notably by Hitler to the German high command .
The cracking of the codes used , the use of the intelligence gained and the subsequent related actions of the Allies is said to have shortened World War Two by two years possibly saving 22 million lives .
The critical importance of Bletchley Park in world history cannot be denied .

Thursday , 25 March 2010 Government Funding for Bletchley Park !!!
Well .
It has finally happened !!!
£ 250 k government funding announced today for Bletchley Park .
Hooray !!!!!!!
Yippee !!!!
Woohoo !!!!!
Thank you so much to everyone who has supported the campaign .
There have been so many people involved that they are too numerous to mention , read my previous blog posts for details of some of those who have given their support to save Bletchley Park .
Thanks to everyone on Twitter who has supported the campaign .
Power to the people !
Look what we did guys !!! :) ) )
Of course , it is not completely over ... we do need to get this amount of money coming in each year for another four years while Bletchley Park get everything there sorted out from the potholes in the car park to the restoration of the fabulous codebreaking huts .
But , this is a milestone , and a big one .
Thank you DCMS .
Details below : Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw will visit Bletchley Park on Thursday to announce the allocation of £ 250,000 DCMS funding for urgent repairs at the neglected WW2 Codebreaking Centre .
The grant , which comes from the reallocation of under - spends elsewhere in the DCMS budget for 2009 - 2010 , will allow the Bletchley Park Trust to tackle a variety of badly needed works on the ageing site including resurfacing pot -holed roads and car - parks and new roofs for iconic , at - risk , codebreaking buildings .
Simon Greenish , CEO of the Bletchley Park Trust , welcomed today 's announcement as hugely significant , saying : " This enormously - appreciated funding boost will not only enable vital repair and maintenance of this WW2 site for the benefit of our rapidly growing number of visitors , but it also represents endorsement by the DCMS that Bletchley Park is a place of national importance which deserves Government support . ”
Ben Bradshaw commended the work of the Bletchley Park Trust , saying : “ The work carried out at Bletchley Park had a huge impact on the course of the war , and the museum does a brilliant job in bringing this alive for people of all ages .
But , having doubled its visitor numbers over the last three years , it urgently needs funds to keep it in good condition .
I am delighted to announce this grant which will help renovate the buildings and ensure that future visitors enjoy a really high quality experience when they come here . ”
The announcement comes after a previous landmark was reached by the Trust in October 2009 when the Heritage Lottery Fund announced a first round pass for the Bletchley Park Trust application for museum development funding and awarded £ 460,000 to work up detailed plans .
These will be submitted early to mid 2011 in a bid to secure the £ 4.1 million needed to realize the plans and subject to the Trust raising the £ 1 million needed for match - funding the bid .
The Trust will then work on raising a further £ 5 million to complete the development .

Well it 's already Ada Lovelace day 2010 !!
That year went quickly :)
Thanks to a brilliant idea last year by the wonderful Suw Charman - Anderson people all over the world have pledged to blog about a Woman in Technology that they are inspired by .
Just have a look at the fabulous map of # ALD10 contributors from all over the world .
Well , I 've finally , after much prevarication , decided who to blog about : BCSWomen .
There are more than one thousand women in tech who are members of BCSWomen and they inspire me individually and as a group , every day , to get out there and do my job .
No matter whether we are facing problems at work or at home , the sort of things that we all have to face at one time or another , BCSWomen are there for each other .
We support each other , encourage each other , share successes and failures together , and are growing older together .
My heroines .
The women who just get out there every day and make a difference .
Thank you all for the support and encouragement you have given me over the last nine years .
I could n't have done what I have without you .

Tuesday , 29 September 2009 â Victory at Bletchley Park Dayâ - Fab funding announcement !!
Fabulous announcement this morning that the Heritage Lottery Fund have approved the proposal submitted by Bletchley Park a few months ago to upgrade the site :) ) )
Thanks * so * much to everyone that has helped and supported the campaign .
BUT please remember that this is not the beginning of the end , but the end of the beginning .......
Bletchley Park still needs your help .
On top of the HLF money it still needs £ 250 k per annum operational funding for the next 5 years plus another £ 6 million funding .
We must save Bletchley Park !!
Here is the official announcement : Bletchley Park are to receive a Heritage Lottery Fund development grant
The Heritage Lottery Fund ( HLF ) has given the green light to the Bletchley Park Trust to work up plans to help transform Bletchley Park into a world class heritage and educational centre it was announced today .
Development funding of £ 460,500 was awarded to help progress their plans .

Thursday , 27 August 2009 Government response a disgrace 10 Downing Street ’s response – or lack of response – to the Save Bletchley Petition , signed by almost 22,000 people , is a disgrace and a slap in the face to the thousands of people that worked there .
Bletchley Park not only saved countless British lives and shortened the war by two years , but it is also the birthplace of modern computing and a vital site in the UK ’s 20th Century wartime and scientific heritage .
If the Government truly acknowledge the contribution made as significant why are they failing to help secure its future ?
The funds already allocated to the park will go some small way to fixing a tiny number of problems , but the whole site , and particularly the huts where the most important work was done , are in a dire state of repair .
This setback will not stop us campaigning – despite this response , we still believe that investment in saving Bletchley Park would be hugely beneficial to the UK , in terms of saving incredibly important history , knowledge and fantastic stories for the nation .

Friday , 10 July 2009 Campaign success !
I 've got lots to report .... last month Chris Lee from New Media Knowledge recorded " Twittering Bletchley Park " a podcast of me talking about using social media in the Saving Bletchley Park campaign .
I also talk in general about Bletchley Park and why it should be saved , do give it a listen .
I had an interesting meeting with Professor Barry Cooper who is Chair of the 2012 Alan Turing Year Centenary Committee where we discussed possible events for 2012 .
Mind you there is an impressive line of events already lined up .
The Director of Bletchley Park , Simon Greenish and I were invited to the Europython 2009 conference in Birmingham to give a keynote talk about Bletchley Park on July 1st .
We were given a very warm welcome from a great group of people .
It was my first talk to such a big crowd , about 450 in the audience !
But I think it went well :)
Click on the photo of me above to go to a video of the talk , Simon Greenish talks first about the history and plans for Bletchley Park .
My sections starts at around 15 minutes .
At the end we unveil an Enigma machine on stage .... the audience loved it and were asking questions for about an hour afterwards :) ) )
Last weekend I gave an invited talk at the Opentech conference in London , this time about women in tech .
I had a nice surprise when I introduced myself .
I said as part of my intro that I campaign for Bletchley Park and got a round of applause and some cheers .
Popular support for Bletchley Park and the camapign is growing :)
I spoke to some very interesting people at the conference , both speakers and audience .
During one of the breaks I had a lovely chat with Tom Watson MP .
I asked him what he could do to help save Bletchley Park .
To my astonishment he said that he would set up a cross party parliamentary group on Bletchley Park .
Go Tom !
What a great guy :)
This week I had a long standing appointment to see Phil Willis MP to talk to him about Bletchley Park and the campaign .
He proved to be another great guy , because after talking to him for just 5 or 10 minutes he said that he will table an Early Day Motion on Bletchley Park !
What a result !
Tom Watson and Phil Willis , two guys in government who really are doing a great job :)
Finally : great news announced today !
All surviving Bletchley Park veterans are to be given medals for their service .
Great that the recognition of the contribution made by these fine people is finally being recognised :) back to top

Why I 'm ashamed to be British !
It is a bad day for the Save Bletchley Park campaign today :(
I recently wrote a short comment piece for the Telegraph newspaper which I encourage you to read , on " Why I 'm ashamed to be British " .
Today , having just listened to the Lords ' questions I am also embarrassed .
The wonderful Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall asked Lord Davies of Oldham " ... what support the UK government will give to the restoration and development of Bletchley Park . "
Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall was joined by Lord Clement - Jones , Lord Eden of Winton , Baroness Trumpington , Viscount Montgomery of Alamein , Lord Selkirk of Douglas and Lord Lea of Crondall in asking for substantial funding to support Bletchley Park .
In a nutshell the reply from Lord Davies of Oldham was that the government are already doing enough .
What utter rubbish !
You can see the discussion on the UK Parliament TV channel here starting at around 5.50 minutes .
It is also in text form here on Hansard .
There is fantastic support from the Lords , with several saying that they have strong connections to Bletchley Park , but the government position is clear : some money has been given to Bletchley Park by English Heritage and Milton Keynes council and that is it .
What a disgrace !
I am absolutely and utterly disgusted .
What is the point of us having a House of Lords if their opinions are brushed aside like this ?
If you are similarly annoyed and based in the UK , please write to your MP .
Here is a draft letter .
If you have the time , a letter in your own words is more effective , it takes a little longer , but has a much bigger impact .
Letters do n't need to be long , one paragraph is enough .
If you could add a short paragraph about what Bletchley Park means to you , that would be great !
Send your letter to your MP at the House of Commons , London SW1A 0AA .

Monday , 11 May 2009 Stephen Fry visits Bletchley Park Today was an absolute Red Letter Day for me and for Bletchley Park :)
On February 4th I blogged about Stephen Fry very kindly tweeting : # bpark You might want to sign the Save Bletchley Park petition .
Read @ Dr_Black 's reasons why on http://is.gd/ikEh - BP won us the war !
stephenfry Stephen Fry and today took that one step further .
Stephen Fry visited Bletchley Park and tweeted the highlights to his almost half a million followers on Twitter !
walking around BP and getting the real Bletchley Park experience : it kind of grows on you as you wander around the site , meeting the remarkable people and hearing the incredible stories , sometimes from people who actually worked there during WW2 !
After Stephen had agreed to visit Bletchley Park for the day I had , as instructed , ( but only just ) managed to keep it a secret , that 's not bad considering a ) it was probably two months of me keeping my mouth shut and b ) it was going to be an exciting day that I , frankly , had only dreamed of truly happening .
I had managed not to tweet or anything about Stephen 's visit to make sure that he could have a relaxing daywalking around BP and getting the real Bletchley Park experience : it kind of grows on you as you wander around the site , meeting the remarkable people and hearing the incredible stories , sometimes from people who actually worked there during WW2 !
So , this morning I got up said goodbye to my lovely family and started the journey up to BP .
When I was on the train to London I noticed a disturbing tweet from Rory Cellan Jones aka @ruskin147 saying that he was on his way to Bletchley Park !
I was outraged and made sure I told him so when we met up ( sorry Rory ! )
Once we got to BP I told Christian aka @documentally off as well for tweeting about Stephen 's visit .
It turned out that he was just winding me up , nothing new there ;)
Then , as we were waiting for Stephen to arrive , and after me telling everyone off , Stephen sent a tweet saying that he had just arrived at Bletchley Park !
Needless to say I managed not to tell Stephen off ! ;)
Over lunch we all had a chat about everything and Simon showed Stephen an Enigma machine .
You can see a video of that here .
After lunch Stephen unveiled the new griffins at the front of the mansion house and we then we had a great time touring BP and talking to many of the fabulous people that work there , like Tony Sale seen above demonstrating Colossus .
75 % of the fantastic staff at Bletchley Park work there as volunteers .
We also met a lovely lady , Dorothy Richards nee Blake , seen below and talking to Stephen Fry here , who worked at BP during WW2 and was on her first trip back since the 40s .
There are still over 1000 BP veterans alive , remarkable people who we could , if funds were available , record their fascinating memories .
Would n't that be great ?
I 've heard many interesting and exciting stories since I 've been involved and I 've only met a few of these amazing people .
If you search on Twitter for # bpark you will find a trail of the day 's happenings , Stephen Fry so obviously enjoyed himself and was of course extremely knowledgeable and very quick to pick up everything that he had not known beforehand .
A genuinely lovely person and now a great supporter of Bletchley Park .
Thank you so much @stephenfry you made my day and that of everyone at Bletchley Park .
I think Bletchley Park will hopefully be safe now that you are involved .
Thank you from the very bottom of my heart .

Friday , 03 April 2009 Ada Lovelace Day Today is Ada Lovelace day .
Thanks to a brilliant idea by the wonderful Suw Charman - Anderson people all over the world have pledged to blog about a Woman in Technology that they are inspired by .
I 've been thinking long and hard since the challenge was laid down and have finally decided who to blog about .
There were so many to choose from , famous women like Steve Shirley and Wendy Hall both of whom are fabulous role models and truly wonderful people .
I 've been very fortunate to know both of them .
I have met so many women through my work setting up and running LondonBCSWomen and then BCSWomen who are absolutely fabulous and much as I 'd like to , I can't mention them all because it would just take so long .
But in a way , is n't that great .... there are * so many * fabulous women in technology , that I know , that I do n't have time to write about them all .
But you know who you are girlfiends .... and you all inspire me every day , even now eleven years after setting up the first group .
How time flies :)
Ada Lovelace
One great woman that I would like to mention quickly is Aliza Sherman , I met her in Brussels in 1998 and she inspired me to eventually set up BCSWomen .
Thanks Aliza :)
I also must mention that I have also been inspired by female colleagues and students at both London South Bank University and my current workplace , the University of Westminster .
There are many great female computer scientists around ...... but we need more .
The woman in technology that I am blogging about today is someone that I found out about at Bletchley Park .
She was born Aldrina Nia Vaughan , latterly known as Dina St Johnston .
Dina set up the UK's first software house in Brickendon , Hertfordshire in February 1959 .
She left school at 16 ( like me ; ) ) and got a job working with the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association in London .
At the same time she studied four nights a week at Croydon Polyechnic .
She passed her exams and wanted to go to Royal Holloway and Bedford College but because most places at that university were reserved for ex-service people and the remaining places went to men she was unable to gain a place .
She therefore went to Sir John Cass College and took and external University of London degree in mathematics .
In 1953 she moved to Elliot Brothers and was sent to attend the Cambridge summer school on Programming in 1954 .
Her programming skills soon drew her to the attention of the computing division .
She worked there for a further five years before setting up her own company : Vaughan Programming Services ( VPS ) .
Please read ' An appreciation of Dina St Johnston ( 1930 - 2007 ) Founder of the UK's first Software House ' by Simon Lavington for more details of her life and achievements .
She sounds like a feisty woman , she remained an active programmer until 1996 , I really wish I had met her .
I would like to know more about Dina St Johnston , do let me know if you have any information you can share about her , I have n't found much in a brief web search .
Many thanks to Lin Jones @linjones on Twitter , volunteer guide at Bletchley Park for giving me the journal paper mentioned above after a discussion about Dina St Johnston last Saturday .
I must remember to blog about the rest of our very interesting conversation sometime soon .
So , Happy Ada Lovelace Day everyone !
Let 's celebrate women in technology , do please consider blogging about a women in technology that you know .
I would love to read it :)

Fabulous news : Bletchley Park has won Wickes Builing with Pride competition !
People have been voting for the last two months for the builing that they are most proud of in the UK , the fact that Bletchley Park has won means that people all over the country care about Bletchley Park , that 's such great news :)
More on the story from the local newspaper The Milton Keynes Citizen .
Also today a great blog post from Rory Cellan Jones , the BBC technology correspondent on our use of social media to engage everyone with the plight of Bletchley Park .
It 's entitled Bletchley Park 's Social Media War. back to top

Please write a letter to your MP
Thanks very much to Chris Campbell who has produced a draft letter that we can all use in the UK to send to our MPs .
If you have the time , a letter in your own words is more effective , it takes a little longer , but has a much bigger impact .
Letters do n't need to be long , one paragraph is enough .
If you could add a short paragraph about what Bletchley Park means to you , that would be great !
Send your letter to your MP at the House of Commons , London SW1A 0AA .
You can find out who your local MP is here Thank you !

Sunday , 22 February 2009 Stephen Fry Tweets " Save Bletchley Park "
On the evening of 3rd February I decided to send a tweet or two to Stephen Fry asking him if he would tweet about saving Bletchley Park , I went to bed afterwards and forgot all about it .
At 10 am the next morning I got an email saying that I had received a direct message from Stephen Fry .
He said that he had sent out a tweet to all his followers !
I checked Twitter to find this : # bpark
You might want to sign the Save Bletchley Park petition .
Read @ Dr_Black 's reasons why on http://is.gd/ikEh - BP won us the war !
stephenfry Stephen Fry
This may not seem like a big thing for the campaign , but believe me , it 's massive !
Stephen then had about 116 000 followers on Twitter , he now has 222 690 .
Twitter has been incredibly powerful in terms of spreading the word .
Well , guess what happened ?
Everything went crazy !
I had people emailing me from all over the world , and many people retweeted Stephen 's original tweet which meant that even more people got to hear about the situation that Bletchley Park finds itself in .
I had 8000 hits on my blog and the petition to save Bletchley Park on the No. 10 Downing Street site went up by over 1000 signatures .
A very unusual day :)
I went to most retweeted person of the day , with Stephen Fry in second place .
See these screen shots taken on the day , to see what happened :)
and Bletchley Park started trending seriously .
Thank you so much Stephen Fry and thank you so much Twitterers , you are really helping to save Bletchley Park .

Monday , 02 February 2009 Bletchley Park Goldmine
Met up with a fabulous person yesterday , his name is Brian Oakley .
Brian is a CBE , was BCS President in 1988 and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Essex .
He is best known as the Chairman of the committee that was responsible for implementing the government program of fifth generation computing research that followed the Alvey report in the 1980s .
I first met Brian when he showed Fran Allen , Caroline Wardle , Phyllis Starkey MP and me around Bletchley Park last September .
Brian was an absolutely fantastic guide , his knowledge of BP is absolutely immense and he is completely committed to saving Bletchley Park and has been for some time .
Brian has an equally amazing wife , Marion , who made us the best cake I have ever tasted in my life , no joke , it really was ( please do n't tell my friend Ilaria , because up until now , her cakes were the best ;-) )
I had been meaning to get in touch with Brian since last September and embarassingly have only just got around to it .
Anyway , we had a really wonderful afternoon together discussing Bletchley Park amongst many other things , Brian and Marion have four children and ten grandchildren who sound absolutely wonderful too !
Brian has produced many documents relating to Bletchley Park over the years including a database of people who worked there and a month by month account of what happened at BP during WW2 .
I 'm hoping that we may be able to get some of the amazing information that he has spent many years compiling online .
Watch this space for details ......
BTW : I found this interesting link whilst Googling Brian :

Wednesday , 28 January 2009 Blogging 4 Bletchley
Had a really enjoyable evening this evening talking to the Extreme Tuesday club about being a geek and saving Bletchley Park .
Many thanks to the wonderful Jason Gorman for coming up with the Blogging 4 Bletchley idea and then organising it .
I had n't really thought that much about being a geek before , but the signs were there for me from an early age : not many friends and used to spend all my pocket money on maths textbooks ;-)
Hmmm .
Anyway , as I was saying , there were some great people in the audience with some good questions and ideas and a really interesting discussion afterwards .
I 'm looking forward to many great things from the blogging / tweeting community in terms of Bletchley Park .
They are a force to be reckoned with .
If you have a blog , please do start Blogging 4 Bletchley : read all about Bletchley Park and start telling people why you think it should be saved , and of course do get in touch if you want any more information .

Friday , 23 January 2009 Remember Tommy Flowers BBC Pods and Blogs aka Jamillah Knowles came along with us last week when we visited Bletchley Park .
Jamillah has produced a fabulous podcast from Captain Jerry Roberts talk at UCL and those of us who were at BP last week .
Listen to it from the BBC Pods and Blogs page
One of the students who was at Captain Jerry Roberts talk last week has blogged about it , which led me to find many others who have blogged about Bletchley Park .
Many people really care about the place and for good reason .
If you have n't signed the 10 Downing Street petition to save BP already , please do so now .

Sunday , 18 January 2009 New Hope for Bletchley Park
What a fabulous day !
I went to Bletchley Park last Wednesday with Mike Atherton , Jamillah Knowles and Christian Payne .
They are better known to those who use Twitter as @ Sizemore , @Jemimah_Knight and @Documentally .
First we had a meeting with Simon Greenish : Director of Bletchley Park and Kelsey Griffin : Director of Operations at BP .
L to R Christian , Mike , Kelsey , Sue
A video clip shot by Christian , shows us introducing ourselves and Simon talking about BP .
We then had a grand tour led by Kelsey , taking in the Mansion House , Station X ( well almost , it was locked , but we stood outside ;-) ) .
We then went to the BP Post Office and Toy Museum .
I was amazed to see a book that I read when I was six years old in the Toy Museum ... made me feel rather old !
Apart from that it was fabulous ;-) very evocative with something there for everyone to have a look at .
That 's the first time I 've been in there and actually , I can't wait to go back and have a better look .
We met the people who set up and run the Toy Museum who were really lovely and also I was introduced by them to the Director of the Bethnal Park Toy Museum as she just happened to be visiting .
Next we had a look at the vintage cars and the boat museum , and then moved on to the cottages where some of the top code breakers worked .
Next was the National Museum of Computing ( NMOC ) which is of course Mecca for a geek like me .
I could spend all day in there .
Do have a look at the photographs taken by Mike , Christian and Jamillah in the new Flickr group of all of these parts of BP , they must have taken about 1000 photographs between them !
Bletchley Park have set up a Flickr group so that anyone with photos of BP can put them online for all to enjoy , another great idea from the group :-) BP also now have a prescence on Twitter : you can follow updates about what they are doing by following @bletchleypark .
From the NMOC we went to have a look at the furnace where all of the paper used for writing down the codes / decrypts etc. was burnt every day , as Christian said " like the forerunner of the modern day shredder " .
It felt like a very symbolic place to me because I can just imagine the people working there assigned to the job walking down there every night with the paper used that day , burning it in the furnace ( on land unfortunately no longer owned by BP ) and there already being messages coming through which needed to be deciphered for the next day .
The position of the wheels on the Enigma or Lorenz machines was changed every day and the code cracked afresh each day .
Next was the Bombe rebuild , and the exhibits in that block , finishing up in the BP shop which has many interesting and varied products for sale , better than your average gift shop .
We ended with Jemimah interviewing us for her BBC Pods and Blogs spot .
As she interviewed Mike and Christian I walked over to the lake and spent 10 minutes thinking about all of the people that worked at BP , most sadly no longer with us :-(
The 10 minutes reflection really made me think that BP should become a living museum , just imagine if when you visit you really get a sense of what it was like there during WWII .
You arrive at the entrance and are questioned by a sentry and not allowed in until you show the correct ID , there are people sitting by the lake who will talk to you about their jobs running the Bombe and Colossus machines , someone in the role of Alan Turing walking or riding aorund on his bicycle , happy to answer questions about his involvement and life there .
How cool would that be for kids visiting ?
Well , and adults too of course .
It was an absolutely fabulous day , and very exciting to see and hear about all of the things that Mike , Christian and Jemimah know that BP can use to help get a whole new audience involved with BP .
As I had hoped , it 's not because people do n't care that BP is not properly funded , although of course that is true for some .
I think it is because not enough of the people that care know the reality of the situation .
I left with a real sense of hope that we had taken a massive step forward with the campaign .
Mike and Christian are fantastic , they are wonderful people that really care about the important things in life , I feel very honoured to have met them and spent a day with them .
The same goes for Jemimah .
None of them had to be there , they very kindly came along to see what was going on and to see if they could help out .
I believe that their input will over the next few months make a dramatic difference to Bletchley Park , and look forward to see how their influence and input plays out .
Do keep checking back here to see what progress has been made and do have a look at www.twitter.com and follow @bletchleypark , you 'll be glad that you did .

Tuesday , 13 January 2009 Adolf Hitler , Fuhrer Attended an absolutely fascinating talk today by Captain Jerry Roberts at University College London .
I was accompanied by Mike Sizemore , Jemimah Knight and my lovely friend Judy Corbalis .
Captain Jerry Roberts shows us one of the valves used by Tommy Flowers when building Colossus Jerry is an amazing speaker .
He told us many stories about his time at Bletchley Park including the time when he deciphered and translated a message that ended with the signature : ' Adolf Hitler , Fuhrer ' .
How incredible must that have been ?
Amazing .
Jerry told us the story of Tommy Flowers who invented the first computer at Bletchley Park : Colossus , Bill Tutte who cracked Tunny and of course Alan Turing .
It was a fabulous afternoon shared by German and History students from UCL who sat quietly with their mouths open throughout the whole talk .
We were all hanging on Jerry 's every word .... with good reason .
I 'm looking forward to the next talk Jerry gives in March , again at UCL .
Many thanks to Professor Suzanne Kord from UCL for organising the talk for her students and very kindly allowing us to attend .
Now to tomorrow , I 'm so excited as I 'm off to Bletchley Park again .
This time with Mike and Jemimah and also Christian , all better known to those on Twitter as @ Sizemore , @Jemimah_Knight and @Documentally .
Mike got in touch with me last week after following a link from my Twitter profile to this blog and then reading about the campaign to get Bletchley Park properly funded .
He told me that both he and Christian who are both social media gurus , really want to do something about the lack of funding for Bletchley Park .
They have done an amazing job already over the last couple of days of promoting the cause , and I think that what they are going to do tomorrow when we are at BP is going to make a massive difference .
I can't wait to see how tomorrow goes ..... watch this space .... back to top
Monday , 08 December 2008 Mavis Batey on CBS news Fabulous coverage of Bletchley Park on US TV Channel CBS news today : WWII Code Breaking Compound Crumbles
Mavis Batey is interviewed by CBS News correspondent Sheila MacVicar about codebreaking , and Simon Greenish the Director of Bletchley Park shows us the inside of one of the huts , something I have not seen before .
Simon Greenish says that it has been a record year for visitors this year with 70 000 regular visitors plus 5 000 schoolchildren .
With all the publicity that Bletchley Park is getting I 'm sure that numbers will keep increasing :-) back to top

A great lunch and plans for the future Was invited to Jerry and Mei Roberts ' place for lunch and to meet Jack Copeland author of the book ' Colossus ' .
Although I have n't read the whole book ( I 'm ashamed to say ) I have dipped in and out of it , it is an absolutely fascinating read and highly recommended .
Jack and Jerry very kindly signed my copy :-)
After introductions were over we had a good chat about BP .
Jerry is absolutely amazing , he led one of the shifts in the testery at BP during WWII and at 80 + is still going strong .
Jack has amazing knowledge of what happened at BP and codebreaking from both a theoretical and historical point of view .
We had a very enjoyable conversation and then started thinking up ideas for ways to raise funding and awareness for / of BP .
I wrote up a list of exciting ideas and actions .

Thursday , 06 November 2008 Exciting news !
Exciting news this morning , Bletchley Park have received a £ 330 000 grant from English Heritage which will be used to undertake urgent repairs to the roof of the mansion house .
Discussions are also in progress regarding a further £ 600 000 from English Heritage over the next three years .
This is fabulous news and exactly the type of funding for which we have been campaigning .
Simon Greenish , Director of Bletchley Park says ' I think this has come out of the publicity this year with your contribution being a major factor . ' :-)
More details are on the BBC website this morning : New lifeline for Bletchley Park and in today 's Times newspaper where our letter appeared last July : Government grant to save Bletchley Park
The news is starting to be picked up across the media : Bletchley Park recieves £ 330 000 English Heritage grant Bucks Free Press 6th November 2008 Bletchley Park gets £ 330 k lifeline The Register 6th November 2008
Thanks everyone so much for your support , this is great news , and hopefully just the beginning of substantial funding for BP .

Tuesday , 04 November 2008 Media update Received a call from Jerry Roberts to say that the BBC are coming back to interview today him along with Jack Copeland , author of the book Colossus .
This is great news as the more stories from BP that are broadcast the more people in general will realise what a massive role it played in the shortening and winning of WWII .
Hopefully then more people will realise the importance of BP and join the campaign to save it for posterity .
Jerry said that the BBC are going to run a program about Tommy Flowers , the man who designed Colossus .
The campaign and awareness of BP seem to be gaining critical mass , as time goes on more and more people seem to be coming on board :-) back to top
Friday , 19 September 2008 Fran Allen visits Bletchley Park Another exciting day .

Sunday , 24 August 2008 Captain Jerry Roberts
Was invited to see Captain Jerry Roberts and his wife Mei for a chat about BP .
They made me and my daughter Leah extremely welcome , and we talked for at least two hours about BP and Jerry 's involvement there .
Jerry was a shift leader , linguist and senior codebreaker in the testery at BP , an extremely important position .
Jerry said that he had decided to dedicate the rest of his life to highlighting the importance of BP and the people that worked there .
I resolved to help find someone to help him to write about his experiences at BP and to try to get some media interest in him and the story he has to tell .
After only having met 2 hours before we parted firm friends .
I am so lucky to have met or talked to some really incredible people through my campaign .

Thursday , 24 July 2008 Bletchley Park hits the news Wow !
What a day .
I woke up at 4.30 am stressed with the thought that I was going to be interviewed live on BBC News 24 later that day .
I did an interview with Radio Five live at about 7.50 am and then made my way up to Westminster to the BBC studios .
On arrival I did my first ever studio radio interview with the BBC World Service and then got myself ready for a live TV interview .
I sat waiting to go on opposite Feargal Sharkey from the Undertones .
He sang one of the greatest songs of my teenage years : Teenage Kicks , I still feel excited by it every time I hear it , even now .
I wanted to tell him that but was so nervous that I could n't remember the name of the song !
Feargal was then called to go on and I actually started calming down a bit .
After about 10 minutes it was my turn and I went through and did the interview .
I decided when miked up and sitting in the chair that I was going to enjoy it , because if I was stressed I would look stressed on TV .
I think it worked , although when I came out I had no idea what I had said .
I had lunch with Andy Clark who is Chair of Trustees of The National Museum of Computing ( TNMOC ) at Bletchley Park .
We had a really interesting discussion and I found out more about the recent history of Bletchley Park and why it is in the state that it is now .
In the afternoon I did another Radio interview with BBC Radio Wales .
This time they had a female veteran being interviewed with me , she was really interesting and great fun .
I am really humbled when I talk to those that worked there .
Their work , which was very hard work over several years , sometimes seven days per week , contributed to the freedom that I and my family and friends enjoy today .

A letter in the Times Saving the heritage of Bletchley Park We cannot let Bletchley go to rack and ruin
Sir ,
The work undertaken at Bletchley Park during the Second World War in breaking German wartime codes played a significant part in winning that war and securing our future .
The work included the decryption of messages enciphered on the German Enigma machines and the breaking of the German “ Fish ” High Command teleprinter ciphers .
Bletchley Park also played a significant role 65 years ago in the design and development of Colossus , one of the world ’s first programmable electronic computers .
It is therefore fitting that the world ’s first purpose - built computer centre should be home to the National Museum of Computing .
Over the years , Bletchley Park has survived building redevelopment ( 1938 ) , an air raid ( 1940 ) , the destruction of sensitive material and information ( post - 1945 ) and more recently ( 1991 ) , a second attempt at demolition and redevelopment .
That Bletchley Park has survived to the present day is due to the foresight of Milton Keynes Borough Council , which declared the park a conservation area in February 1992 , and the formation of the Bletchley Park Trust just three days later .
The trust currently runs this gem charitably , receiving no external funding .
Although there has recently been some progress in generating income , without fundamental support Bletchley Park is still under threat , this time from the ravages of age and a lack of investment .
Many of the huts where the codebreaking occurred are in a terrible state of disrepair .
As a nation , we cannot allow this crucial and unique piece of both British and world heritage to be neglected in this way .
The future of the site , buildings , resources and equipment at Bletchley Park must be preserved for future generations by providing secure long - term financial backing .
Is it too much to ask that Bletchley Park be provided with the same financial stability as some of our other great museums such as the Imperial War Museum , the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum ?

A busy and exciting week Here is my email to CPHC :
Dear all ,
It has been a very busy and exciting week :-)
I was interviewed at Bletchley Park on Monday by Rory Cellan Jones , the interview will be on the Today Programme on Radio 4 tomorrow morning and possibly on BBC 1 pm and 6 pm news depending on what else happens tomorrow .
I am also going to be on Radio Five Live at 6.50 am tomorrow morning ( ouch ! ) and BBC news 24 at 11.30 am .
The letter that my colleague John Turner very kindly wrote will be in the Times tomorrow and is already on their website .
I was asked to choose 5 - 6 names from the 97 to put in the newspaper so have chosen those that I am hoping will have most resonance with the general public , many thanks to those six people .
All signatories names are included on the Times website , but unfortunately , apart from the six aforementioned , they are there without titles or affilations , apologies for that , I have asked the Times to rectify this , so maybe they will change it .
http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article4385384.ece
I really hope that we have included everyone that emailed us in the list , if not my apologies , it has been really hectic over the last few days .
Also apologies to Professor Lawrence Paulson , for some reason the ' Professor ' has disappeared from your ' signature ' .
Thank you all so much for your support for the campaign , it has been absolutely overwhelming , and I think that because of your support we may now actually get somewhere with this .... and something fundamental may happen .
I 'm really becoming quite confident that we do now have a good chance of getting some serious funding :-)
Please talk to everyone you know who may be interested in the campaign , I 'm hoping to appeal to the general public tomorrow to raise awareness amongst those that know very little about Bletchley Park , to get them onboard , to help them to realise that this is part of our heritage , all of us .
We need to preserve Bletchley Park so that our children and grandchildren know and understand about the massive effort put into cracking the codes and winning WW2 and also the history of computing in this country .
I hope that I can get the message over well tomorrow , thanks again so much for your support everyone , you have really made a difference .
Best regards

An exciting phone call Was working at home planning to meet up with Professor Caroline Wardle from Queen Mary College for a working lunch to discuss a trip to Bletchley Park for Fran Allan : the only female Turing award winner who had taught Caroline at University in the States .
Got a call from Rory Cellan - Jones saying that he was going up to BP to shoot some film and record something for the radio , would I be interested in being interviewed at BP for radio and possibly a piece for TV too ?
Was I interested ?!
Called Caroline who kindly agreed to meet me earlier than planned and then got the train up to BP .
Was interviewed there by Rory for TV and radio .
I had thought I would be nervous , but actually I was n't .
As I stood looking at the huts I just felt really annoyed that nothing was being done to save them .

The BBC are interested !
To my great surprise got a call from Rory Cellan - Jones and Mark Ward at the BBC .
Had a good chat with them , they were both lovely and really interested in doing a piece about BP .
Fabulous !
They suggested that the Letter to the Times from CPHC should go in next Thursday , they could not tell me why it had to be next Thursday ..... if they did they would have to shoot me ;-)
Exciting stuff .
I agree that the letter can go in next Thursday .

Talk to the BBC
After getting such a great response from the Council for Professors and Heads of Computing to the letter which will appear in the Times sometime soon I decided to email my contacts in the media to see if they were interested in picking up the story .
I emailed Rory Cellan - Jones at the BBC amongst others and amazingly he got back to me almost straight away !
I chatted to Rory about BP and why we had to do something now to save it , I did n't feel that he was that interested ... back to top
Monday , 14 July 2008 The Council for Professors and Heads of Computing Emailed the The Council for Professors and Heads of Computing : From : Dr Sue Black
Sent : 14 July 2008 17:51
To : CPHC
Subject : Saving Bletchley Park
Dear all ,
Many thanks to the very many of you who along with me signed the Bletchley Park petition recently .
As Simon Greenish , the Director of Bletchley Park pointed out to me , the Bletchley Park petition now ranks higher on the popularity list than the petition asking for a knighthood for Bruce Forsyth .
Excellent news , well done everyone ;-)
This email is a bid to take the campaign one step further .
I went to Bletchley Park this month taking in a wonderful guided tour of the site .
Whilst absolutely amazed by the history and the interesting and exciting stories of the fabulous work that went on there during WWII I was horrified to see the state of some of the huts where the codebreaking took place .
One hut in particular is falling apart and has a blue tarpaulin nailed over one end ( small photo attached ) , to be honest I found it quite distressing .
I came home determined to do more .
So , I am appealing to you again to help me continue with the campaign to save Bletchley Park .
Pasted below this email is a letter drafted by John Turner , a colleague of mine at the University of Westminster , which I would like you to read and ' sign ' if you agree by replying to this email with your name and affiliation .
We will send the letter along with signatories to the Times newspaper in approximately ten days time .
If you know of any computing pioneers or others whose signatures you think may add weight to the campaign please do feel free to forward this request .
Apologies for taking up your time with another email on this subject , but I believe that , not only is this a cause worth fighting for , but also that time is of the essence , a hut from the 1940s covered in a tarpaulin is not going to last for ever .
Best regards

The Air Force has abandoned its plans for building a coal - to - liquid plant to produce aircraft fuel .
While the plan would have reduced foreign dependence , all those emissions would have kinda sucked .
In an effort to certify that all aircraft can use a 50 - 50 blend by 2011 , the Air Force is currently purchasing fuel made by coal from Sasol of South Africa .
Gary Strasburg , an Air Force spokesman , said that the B1 , B52 and C - 17 have all been certified to run on a coal - mix blend .
The F - 15 , F - 22 , C - 5 and KC - 135 have all used the blend too .
But liquid fuel from coal produces more than twice the greenhouse gas emissions as conventional fuel .
It ’s not realistic .
It ’s not even a stop gap solution !
And while environmentalists might be citing this as a win , the Air Force said the decision to not build the Montana - bound plant was due to …security .
Ugh .
They cited a conflict between the plant and the base ’s nuclear weapon storage .
Strasburg said he could n’t comment on whether there were environmental concerns for the decision at all .
I am guessing …no .
Check out this article : Air Force Will Be Coal - Powered by 2011
A 2007 energy law requires that federal agencies not purchase fuels with greater greenhouse gas emissions than conventional petroleum fuels .
Henry Henderson of the Natural Resources Defense Council , said coal - to - liquid fuels “ make no sense for a free economy ” because they ’re expensive and would require taxpayer funds to get them off the ground .
“ We have a very long history of trying to do this in the United States and it repeatedly results in subsidies from the public and inability to compete in any fair market place , ” he said .
However , the Air Force is investigating advanced biofuels which would lower greenhouse gases .

IE8 Blacklist : forcing standards rendering opt -in Thursday , February 12 , 2009
A year ago Microsoft announced ( through A List Apart ) that standards compliant websites would be forced to opt into a standards rendering mode in IE8 .
The uproar from the web standards community was loud and clear : the default should always be render in standards compliancy mode .
Microsoft backed down .
So it is with considerably surprise and anger to read that Microsoft have quietly gone back to their original position .
The gist of it is if you want to be sure your site renders in standards compliant mode in IE , you have to explicitly opt into it .
Otherwise you risk being blacklisted and thrown into IE7 Compatibility mode .
Blacklisting domains to IE7 rendering
In a blog posting that seems to have gone unnoticed by the web standards crowd titled " Compatibility view improvements to come in IE8 " by Scott Dickens , he writes :
When users install Windows 7 Beta or the next IE8 update , they get a choice about opting - in to a list of sites that should be displayed in Compatibility View .
Sites are on this list based on feedback from other IE8 customers : specifically , for what high - volume sites did other users click the Compatibility View button ?
This list updates automatically , and helps users who are n't web - savvy have a better experience with web sites that are n't yet IE8 - ready .
So if enough people click on the Compatibility View button in IE8 on pages on a website then everyone opted - in to this list will have that site rendering in IE7 Compatibility mode .
There seems to be no indication of a manual check of a site before it gets added to this blacklist , and the [ t ] his list updates automatically rather suggests there is no manual checking .
So if a large number of people went to A List Apart at the same time and a enough of them clicked on the Compatibility View , A List Apart 's domain would be added to a blacklist .
By default A List Apart would then be rendered in the IE7 Compatibility Mode regardless of whether it renders correctly or not in the Standards Mode .
Then the only way for A List Apart to be rendered in IE8 's standards rendering mode is to explicitly opt into it .
This is exactly what we , the web standards community , rebelled against last year .
Targetting top - level domain
What is even worse is that sites are blacklisted by top - level domain .
As the IE8 blog post describes :
The data we collect from IE8 beta users is the top level domain of the website and whether the user chose Compatibility View while visiting that site .
This is insidious ; organisations running multiple sites on subdomains ( like Yahoo , AOL , CNN , Blogger , WordPress , Wikipedia , Ning ) are exposed to a new risk : a problem with one single subdomain is sufficient to black - list all their websites into an IE7 Compatibility Mode .
That means if we invest a load of time making sure our top- priority sites are working immaculately in IE8 's standard rendering mode then with enough Compatibility clicking on a site that is n't a high priority site is enough to damn all of our sites into this blacklist .
The danger here is that Microsoft do n't seem to be collecting the reason behind why a visitor clicked on Compatibility View .
So a couple of hundred curious people seeing if the Web Standards Project website works in IE7 Compatibility mode might be enough to stop the Web Standards Project 's website from rendering perfectly in IE8 .
And the only way they can prevent that is to opt-in to the standards rendering mode .
What message does that send to the web standards community when WaSP requires an explict opt-in to IE8 rendering ?
Forcing an opt-in to standards rendering
To pre-empt this nonsense the practical course of action is to add the IE8 Compatibility view to your pages now before your sites get added to a blacklist .
Exactly what Microsoft announced a year ago .
They 've routed around the web standards community .
Again .
Two extra browsers to test in
And to spite us , last week I noticed that the IE7 Compatibility mode does n't render pages exactly the same as Internet Explorer 7 itself .
So not only do we have to test a new browser with IE8 ( which is now A - Grade according to our Graded browser support ) , it is looking very likely ( if I can confirm the bug .
Now confirmed . ) we will have to test IE7 and IE7 Compatibility Mode separately .
Unreal .

Federal regulators shepherding the U.S. digital television transition visited Los Angeles on Monday and asked for divine assistance .
Broadcasters turn off their analog signals in just over four months , and Federal Communications Commission staffers can’t make sure that people buy and set up the converter boxes they ’ll need for their older TV sets that are hooked up to antennas .
Who can ?
Ministers .
“ We need people to take up leadership in their community and make sure nobody gets left out in the switch , ” FCC Commissioner Jonathan S. Adelstein said during a public forum at the Mount Moriah Baptist Church in South Los Angeles .
“ Churches already have the infrastructure in place to do that . ”

Standing at the church pulpit , Adelstein asked the Baptist Ministries Conference of Los Angeles , nearly 50 African American preachers who meet once a month , to include information on the June 12 digital TV switch in their sermons .
L.A. County has the largest number of over - the - air viewers in the country , Adelstein said , and those viewers are concentrated in the minority and elderly communities .
“ It ’s sort of an ad - hoc approach to handling this situation , but the next four months will fly by and we need to be ready , ” he said .
Adelstein and five local FCC field officers handed out applications for $ 40 coupons for digital - to - analog converter boxes .

They also dispensed a few pieces of advice :
There is n’t much difference between a $ 40 converter box and a $ 70 model ; and cable and satellite TV customers do n’t need one at all .
Adelstein and the field officers spent their morning at a senior center in West Covina , where they explained the upcoming switch and showed how to connect a converter box to a TV .
After the midday stop at the church , the group headed to Cal State L.A. to reach out to the Latino community .
The transition , originally scheduled for Feb. 17 , was delayed last week by Congress until June 12 .
FCC field officers are planning more meetings in schools , churches and neighborhood centers before the switch , Adelstein said .
The Monday meeting at Mount Moriah was organized by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights .

Woodie Ramsey , a deacon at Southern Missionary Baptist Church of South East Los Angeles , said the ministers were prepared to spread the word .
“ It ’s incumbent upon each church to take care of the needs of its ministry , and this is just one more need for our people , ” he said .
“ We ’ll do our part . ”

During the early nineties a glut of game based music hit the bargain bins of record stores across the UK & beyond , their purpose ?
To make you part with your ( or your parents , or if you were a bully , your neighbours ) hard earned cash in exchange for what ?
For the chance to be able to listen to the sound FX that was annoying in the game , out in the real world ( the real world being your bedroom , next to your console ) .
But , strangely enough these commercial oddities seemed to have fallen off the face of the planet .
This reporter has dispensed of the rose tinted glasses he keeps next to his Bros CD collection , and taken the necessary but disturbing step of sampling these products ‘ sober ’ , and let me tell you it was not pretty !
So I invite you all to follow me as I transverse all taste barriers to bring you the “ Top 5 Videogame Based Chart Singles ” of all time !
5 . The World Warrior – Street Fighter II ( 1994 )
The trend with these novelty singles was not only to just loop the most memorable part of the video game ( in this case the main theme from Street Fighter II ) but also for the performer to change their artist name to tie - in with the product , Simon Harris changed his name ( not by deed poll unfortunately ) to the mighty sounding “ World Warrior ” to coincide with the popularity Street Fighter II , and apparently its “ gunna be bad . ”
With a rap performed by ( ahem ) Einstein , who has a fondness of repeating tough sounding phrases such as “ I wo n’t break ” & “ hit the switch ”
The track actually executes a nice beat down section using the familiar dulcet from Ken ’s theme , which really breaks up the extremely liberal use of the main melody .
This turkey lasted a grand total of 1 week in the charts peaking at number 70 , sparing us the embarrassment of a music video and spin off album , phew !
Unsurprisingly this release is now fairly hard to track down due to its differing titles ( it ’s known as the Street Fighter rap album in Japan ) and general lack of knowledge / interest .
So , being the nice chap that I am , I have provided a link to an unofficial fan made music video .
All together now “ I wo n’t break coz I ’m a Street Fighter ! ”
Special mention has to go to Hyadain for his own brilliant spin( ning piledriver ) on the Street Fighter lineage , check it out here .
4. SFX – Lemmings SFX ( 1993 )
Lemmings was cute was n’t it ?
Listening to your little confused comrades final words in a hilariously high pitched voice as he tried in vain to grasp the reality of violence & the impact of peer pressure in mainstream society , really captured the essence of the times .
Listening to those cries for mercy outside the realm of video games however , makes you want to sharpen your earlobes , scrape them on a blackboard , and pray that your eardrums can no longer register high frequencies .
If you want to remember just what tools we were in the early nineties then just fire this onto your vinyl player .
Wince !
At what can only be described as a Cockney rain man who ’s ingested too much tartrazine attempting to summarize the Lemmings experience , Cringe !
At the sound of an extremely bad ventriloquist act singing the chorus whilst gargling razor blades , & Vomit !
At the synth package stolen from D:ream ’s garden shed .
Clocking in at a respectable Number 51 in the UK Top 40 and clinging on to its chart status for 3 weeks , this release had all the charm of a digger lemming , burrowing through your kneecaps .

3. H.W.A. featuring Sonic the Hedgehog – Supersonic ( 1992 )
Remember when mainstream music of this era had a vocal effect that just basically sounded like a mix between “ high yeah ” & “ hiya ” sung by a whining dog being sucked through a wind turbine ?
Well if you liked that you ’ll be in seventh heaven when you hear this !
This song just basically goes through the motions of repeating as much it can , as many times as it could be allowed .
Based on the first levels from Sonic the Hedgehog , the Theremin / whistle style synthesisers make it sound more X - files Zone than Green Hill Zone .
The lack of any real lyrics is a welcome change to the descriptions of the game play being touted by the other novelty records until , that is the “ hiya ” vocals come back into contention for the 40th time .
Apparently , being the charitable fellows that they are , Sega donated all royalties coming their way to the Nordoff - Robbins Music Therapy Centre .
This provided them with a new whistle , and gave this track a special bye into third place in our countdown ( I ’m such a humanitarian ) .
Very little evidence exists of this track actually making it into the UK charts at all , but according to comprehensive UK chart data collation website , chartstats.com this production from H.W.A actually registered at number 38 in the nation ’s favourite countdown of artistic celebration and phenomenal marketing , before hitting its purple patch at number 33 the following week .
Sadly though not tussling toe to toe with the number one at the time , Whitney Houston ’s gift to inebriated karaoke contestants and X - factor rejects everywhere , “ I Will Always Love You . ”
Click here to listen .
2. Ambassadors of Funk featuring M.C. Mario – Super Mario Land ( 1992 )
I completely refute the artist ’s claim as being the ambassador of such a diverse and widely heralded genre of music , but nevertheless this effort from Simon Harris ( sigh ) takes a stab at being heard in an eco system congested with ballads ( I Will Always Love You ) , hypocritical statements on the redistribution of wealth ( Heal the World ) , & Phillip Schofield .
This is , admittedly one of the more bearable efforts from this spinoff of commercial hideousness .
Lifting the melody from Super Mario Land , this release actually makes good use of the sound effects in a percussive sense rather than just randomly throwing a couple of samples over the top of already sampled game music , & there ’s no denying that the use of the melody in conjunction with the “ whoop ” sound FX make you want to get on the dance floor and utterly embarrass yourself in a “ your barred for life ” kind of way .
Another neat touch is the use of the game over theme at the end of the track .
It seems that a little bit of care went into giving the fan boys , something to salivate over .
Collaborating with M.C Mario ( a.k.a Einstein , me thinks ) the lyrics are the usual generic affair , just act as if you are playing the game and speak what you see ( a bit like The Streets and their descriptions of bus stops ) .
Peaking at number 8 and hanging in for a further 8 weeks , Ambassadors hit their high point when they were one of the select few artists to be included on the seminal collection of chart hits of the year , Now That ’s What I Call Music 23 .
Interesting Fact Number 1 : The sequel to this song Go Mario Go !
Did n’t even register on the UK charts , and signalled Ambassadors exit from the video game tie - in scene , and the planet .
Interesting fact Number 2 : Simon Harris is still in the music business .

1. Doctor Spin – Tetris ( 1992 )
Take the most famous Russian folk song ( Korobeiniki for the fact obsessed ) , splice in a generic drum beat , and a strange pseudo - Russian gentleman proclaiming what only is audible as “ uddah ! ”
Then what you have is the greatest ( in the most generous manner possible ) track based on a video game , of all time !
What is great about this other than the complete lack of creative substance from Doctor Spin is the astonishing fact is that the name Doctor Spin is the pseudonym used by none other than the child catcher - alike of musical theatre , Andrew Lloyd Webber and , the respected musical director / producer of high brow theatre , Nigel Wright .
Whatever the reason for Webber to drop technicolor dreamcoats for technicolor building blocks remains a mystery , but it proved to be a lucrative one .
This is the most successful entry in our countdown charting at a mind - boggling Number 6 in the UK charts , and spent 8 weeks lurking about said chart until the record playing public realized that owning this CD is more embarrassing than getting caught doing things with Henry Hoover other than the housework .
Pssst .
Here ’s a bit of a gem for you , this song performed “ live ” on Top Of the Pops .
Go , NOW !!
Another title that never made it into the countdown Pac Man Fever by Buckner & Garcia is so bad that it ’s …. absolutely terrible and I really could n’t listen to it for more than a minute , and is one of many ode ’s to classic games available on the Pac Man Fever album along with Do the Donkey Kong , which if played backwards contains a delicious recipe for cyanide soup .

Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has said she will " answer any questions " Parliament 's sleaze watchdog has about £ 116,000 in " second home " expenses .
Ms Smith named her sister 's London home as her main residence and her family home in Redditch as her " second home " .
She insists she has done nothing wrong and that she followed the rules .
But Standards Commissioner John Lyon has asked her to explain claims by her London neighbours she spent as little as two nights a week at that address .
On average , neighbours Dominic and Jessica Taplin say they believe Ms Smith spent three nights a week at the address , based on sightings of the police on duty in the street outside .
Mr Taplin said he wanted to get to the truth of the matter and has also written to the Commons fees office , which looks after MPs ' expenses .
Full investigation
He told BBC News : " I think it 's wrong that someone like the home secretary should be claiming something that does n't appear to be true .

More from BBC Radio 5 live " I would hope that Jacqui Smith would tell the truth , which presumably can be backed up with police logs and she can say how many nights she spends in the house in London . "
The couple initially contacted Conservative leader David Cameron by e-mail about their concerns , Tory sources have confirmed - prompting Labour claims their complaint is politically motivated .
Mr Cameron 's office told the Taplins it was not a matter for them but suggested they might wish to contact a newspaper as this would be " in the public interest " .
The couple then spoke to the Mail on Sunday , which ran a story on their allegations at the weekend , before making a complaint to the Standards Commissioner .
Mr Lyon has previously turned down two requests to investigate Ms Smith over her decision to designate her sister 's house - where she stays when she is in London - as her main home , but his decision to formally accept this latest complaint could lead to a full investigation .
' Market rate ' Jacqui Smith 's decision to call her sister 's home her main residence has enabled her to claim at least £ 116,000 in second home allowances on her constituency home in Redditch , Worcestershire , since becoming an MP .
Ms Smith has consistently denied any wrongdoing , insisting that she has written approval from the Commons fees office for her arrangements .
Jacqui Smith says she 's ' done nothing wrong ' but that 's not how the public see it
Norman Baker , Lib Dem MP
She told BBC News : " I followed the advice I was given and I have followed the rules , " adding that she would " respond to any questions the independent commissioner asks me " .
Sources close to the home secretary have told BBC News that she paid rent to her sister at a market rate and that her sister paid full tax on the income .
They add that Ms Smith does not simply rent one room and that her children come to stay at the London address , including over Christmas and the New Year .
Sources claim she spends the bulk of her time in London but had asked the police to maintain a " low profile " so the neighbours may not have realised she was in residence .
The fees office had told her it was " irrelevant " to an allowance claim where her family lived - it was all about where she spent most of her time , they say .
' Not right '
Mr Lyon has asked Ms Smith to set out exactly how much time she spends at the address in south - east London .
Commenting on the affair on BBC Radio 5 Live , David Cameron said : " I think that what we need to know is what is her main home . "
He added that it was necessary to establish whether Ms Smith 's arrangement was " reasonable " , saying : " I think the home secretary has some questions to be asked on that front . "
Lib Dem MP Norman Baker , who campaigns for greater parliamentary accountability , welcomed Mr Lyon 's decision to look into Ms Smith 's allowances - and called for a tightening of the rules surrounding second home allowances .
" There is clearly an opportunity for MPs to designate their first and second homes in order to maximise financial advantage , which can not be right . "
He added : " Jacqui Smith says she 's ' done nothing wrong ' , but that 's not how the public see it . "

ikipedia says " Freckles are clusters of concentrated melanin which are most often visible on people with a fair complexion .
A freckle is also called an " ephelis . "
The freckle phenomenon spans races and complexions though .
Despite it 's rareness in the African race , freckles are indeed genetic and are passed down and are triggered by exposure to sunlight ( UV - B radiation specifically ) .
Contrary to popular belief , freckles are n't a skin disorder or skin condition , they 're simply a variation due to melanin amounts in the skin .
How do you feel about freckles ?
So weird .
This iRobot Packbot has a Situational Awareness Mast built - in , a surveillance system which can grow from 25 inches to 20 feet lifting 200 pounds , on its top configuration .
The mechanism is very ingenious :
Developed for military and applications by Geosystems , the Situational Awareness Mast does n't use a telescopic design to extend itself , which are very limited and can get extremely bulky and heavy in no time .
In the case of the SAM - also called Zipper Mast - there are three metal rolls that assemble together in a triangle - like some kind of zipper - while going up , providing enough support and stability to lift objects up to 200 pounds .
There are various models available :
• SAM 8 , that goes from four inches to eight feet and can lift six pounds , enough for a video camera and other sensors .
• SAM 10 , that goes up to 12 feet lifting 140 pounds , and costs $ 11,000 .
• SAM 12/15 , which raises from 15 inches to 15 feet with a 150 pounds weight limit .
• And the top - of - the - line SAM 20 , that goes from 25 inches to 20 feet raising up to 200 pounds .

Before readers start throwing brickbats at the mention of the name of Alan Greenspan , it ’s important to remember that he has become the poster boy of the policy errors that lead to our financial mess .
And that is n’t an accurate picture .
This crisis had many parents , and even though Greenspan was one of the key actors , he was far from alone .
Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Larry Summers were also backers of the financialization of the economy , the permissive regulatory posture , and the strong dollar policy .
Greenspan , to his credit , at least appears chastened by the mess helped create .
As far as I can tell , very few of the other perps have questioned their decisions .
Greenspan spoke this evening at the Economic Club of New York .
Some of his comments show that he has made some considerable shifts from his libertarian , anti-regulation stance .
But he has n’t had a Damascene moment ; he seems to be changing his views incrementally .
Nevertheless , it ’s remarkable that Greenspan has come out saying that nationalizing banks is the “ least bad ” policy option , as he did in a Financial Times interview .
Now we are seeing role reversal : the loyal libertarian reluctantly admitting the need for regulation and the advantages of taking over dud banks , even big dud banks , while the Democrats tip toe around the idea of doing anything that might ruffle bankers feathers too much .
Note that he stresses , as we have , the need to clean up the financial system for fiscal stimulus to be effective ( as in kick the economy into a higher gear , rather than provide a temporary amphetamine hit that quickly wears off ) .
He also sounded a warning similar to Willem Buiter ’s , that the US is fiscally constrained and cannot run deficits as large as we might otherwise like without incurring serious sdverse consequences .
Buiter has warned of the danger of a collapse in dollar assets .
Greenspan seems more concerned about immediate effects , namely , rising long term bond rates ( the Fed in theory can suppress a rate rise by buying long - dated Treasuries , but I suspect in practice this policy would lead to private investors and other central banks abandoning the long end of the yield curve , knowing the Fed could not continue this strategy on an unlimited basis , and the Fed having qualms about ballooning its balance sheet to grotesque size .
Even at this level , the Fed seems cautious about further balance sheet growth , even though some have argued the Fed would need to expand its balance sheet far more aggressively to combat deleveraging ) .
From the Financial Times :
The US administration will have to go back to Congress for additional funds to recapitalise the banking system to restore the normal flow of credit in the economy , Alan Greenspan , former chairman of the Federal Reserve , said yesterday … .
Mr Greenspan warned that , without a proper banking sector fix , the $ 787bn fiscal stimulus would provide only short - term relief .
“ Given the Japanese experience of the 1990s , we need to assure that the repair of our financial system precedes the onset of major fiscal stimulus , ” he said .
“ Unless we are successful at that , in my judgment , the positive impact of a fiscal stimulus will peter out after its scheduled completion . ”
Mr Greenspan said foreign investor appetite for US government debt was not unlimited .
“ There is obviously a limit to the expansion of US federal debt , ” he said .
He said the recent rise in long - term interest rates “ may be signalling market concerns ” .
The former Fed chairman – a champion of laisser - faire principles – said he now acknowledged there was “ no alternative to a set of heightened federal regulatory rules for banks and other financial institutions ” .
However , he suggested that rather than rely heavily on regulators to prevent the next crisis , the authorities should simply increase the amount of capital banks were required to hold against risks of all kinds …
But at a time when the US Congress is racing to begin legislation on a new regulatory framework for the financial system , Mr Greenspan urged less haste , saying the market was currently imposing strict discipline .
As for the idea of increasing capital levels , it ’s a poor second best to rethinking what the financial system ought to look like .
And it is truly sobering how little serious thought has been done on that front .
As for Greenspan depicting Congress champing at the bit to reform the industry , that could n’t be further from the truth .
Enacting strict limits on pay to TARP recipients is a far cry from meaningful regulatory reform .
From the Financial Times interview :
In an interview with the FT Mr Greenspan , who for decades was regarded as the high priest of laissez - faire capitalism , said nationalisation could be the least bad option left for policymakers .
” It may be necessary to temporarily nationalise some banks in order to facilitate a swift and orderly restructuring , ” he said .
“ I understand that once in a hundred years this is what you do . ” …
The former Fed chairman said temporary government ownership would ” allow the government to transfer toxic assets to a bad bank without the problem of how to price them . ”
However , he wimped out on cramming down bondholders ( note Martin Wolf and Nouriel Roubini , among others , have advocated that step , although Wolf did warn that it would need to be done with ample preparation for temporary disruption ) :
” You would have to be very careful about imposing any loss on senior creditors of any bank taken under government control because it could impact the senior debt of all other banks , ” he said .
“ This is a credit crisis and it is essential to preserve an anchor for the financing of the system .
That anchor is the senior debt . ”
Greenspan is a consultant to Pimco , and Pimco has consistently bet that the Feds would be nice to banks ( I am told by someone in a position to know that they own a lot of junior bank debt ) .
So this statement may be de facto an admission by Greenspan that he sees nationalization as inevitable and is trying to shape what form it takes .
WASHINGTON -- Troubled financial institutions and the Detroit auto makers continue to spend heavily on lobbying Congress while accepting billions of dollars in U.S. government money , reports to Congress suggest .
General Motors Corp. spent $ 3.3 million on lobbying in the fourth quarter of 2008 , a period that coincides with the government committing $ 13.4 billion to the ailing auto maker under the Treasury 's Troubled Asset Relief Program .

The powers of the world are in a new arms race far more terrifying in its scope than the race for nuclear weapons .
Bio -weaponry and bio-wars are now real threats to the future of the human race .
What sounds like the stuff of futuristic science fiction is already a quiet reality .
The recent announcement of the new site for the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility brings this reality to light , particularly as this site will house level 4 pathogens , some of which are zoonotic , meaning they can jump the species barrier and infect humans .
The new facility , to be built near Manhattan , Kansas will be classified as Biological Safety Level 4 ( BSL - 4 ) , a designation that allows for the study of the most deadly , most contagious diseases known , diseases for which there are no cures .
It will replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center , located 100 miles northeast of New York City in the Long Island Sound , just six miles off the Connecticut coastline and accessible only by ferry or helicopter , a location where prevailing winds blow out to sea .
That facility is closing under the rationale that it does not have the security in place for this higher level of usage .
Plum Island carries a lesser BSL - 3 classification .
Connecticut residents knowledgeable about what goes on at Plum objected to the creation of a new facility where the old one stands , fearing that lethal viruses could escape onto the mainland .
The Department of Agriculture ran the Plum Island lab until 2003 , when it was turned over to the Homeland Security Department as part of the nation 's biological defense program .
The public 's perception of the research at Plum Island , created by government public relations releases , has centered on its mandate to protect herds from hoof - and - mouth disease , a highly contagious virus that is deadly to animals .
According to government PR , researchers at Plum work on detection of disease , epidemic control strategies , vaccines and drugs , tests of imported animals , and training of professionals .
A large body of evidence suggests there is much more than this going on at Plum .
Circumstantial and factual data has presented the likelihood that Plum is responsible for a number of disease outbreaks that have proven to be national public health and agricultural nightmares .
Many see Plum Island as responsible for the re-introduction of the hoof - and - mouth disease it now claims to control .
Some point to bio-containment mechanisms at Plum that were allowed to deteriorate and remain non-functional for several years , and lax security that allowed accidents to happen .
Others suspect more deliberate actions .
While the stated mission of the new site continues to be the control of such animal diseases , the location for the new facility in Kansas places it near 542,507 head of livestock , over three times the amount in the vicinity of other sites that were considered .
An outbreak of hoof - and - mouth disease could require the destruction of tens of millions of farm animals and devastate the livestock industry .
The diseases being researched at Plum are not necessarily contained in glass viles .
There are a number of infected live animals for study there with diseases having incubation periods extending for several days .
This means it is very possible for a researcher to be infected on Friday , take the ferry home to Connecticut and spend the weekend spreading the infection before any signs of it are visible in him .
The government maintains that there has never been a leak to the mainland , and apparently the first appearance of Lyme disease just 13 miles from the facility falls under the category of coincidence , as does the still unexplained initial U.S. appearance of West Nile virus in Long Island and New York .
The development of bio-weapons in the U.S. dates back at least to the 1930's when the U.S. Public Health Service conducted an experiment on 399 black men in the late stages of syphilis , called the Tuskegee Experiment .
The experiment was designed to see how long it took for men to die from infection by the syphilis spirochete .
During the 1950s and 60s , bio - warfare attacks took place in many parts of America , the most noted being the six day attack on San Francisco during which potentially harmful bacteria were sprayed over the city .
In this attack , reported in the September 17 , 1979 , twelve people developed pneumonia and one man died .
In 1954 , Plum scientists looked for ways to inflict bio -damage on Soviet livestock .
According the Cuban government , in the 1960s and 70s bio-weapons developed at Plum were deployed against Cuban agriculture , targeting pork , tobacco and sugar cane .
During the Cold War years , thousands of U.S. citizens were used in radiation experiments conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission and other government agencies .
In 2001 the U.S. Department of Defense ( DOD ) issued a press release admitting it conducted over one hundred tests in which thousands of American servicemen were intentionally dosed with chemical and biological weapons during the period from 1962 to 1973 .
Dozens of harmful agents like VX , Sarin gas , E- coli bacteria and Bacillus globigii , a cousin to anthrax and bubonic plague , were used on completely unaware and unprotected men .
The announcement by the DOD was strategically placed just two days after the mind - numbing 9/11 attacks , at a time when it was given little to no attention by the national media .
Bio - warfare development intensified in the 1970 's particularly in the areas of genetic engineering .
Much of it was euphemistically referred to as cancer research .
During this period cancer causing viruses began to jump from one species of animal to another , a characteristic that signals the viruses are man made .
New immunodeficiency diseases were then seen in lab animals .
Although generally regarded as conspiracy theory , some AIDS researchers believe the Special Virus Cancer Program and its connection to bio-warfare development spawned an immunosuppressive virus that was seeded into the gay community via the government sponsored experimental hepatitis B vaccine drive .
The , October 19 , 1998 reported bio -warfare experiments that took place at Fort Detrick between 1954 and 1973 , utilizing volunteers who were exposed to germs causing tularemia , malaria , anthrax , Rocky Mountain spotted fever , encephalitis , and other diseases .
Prevention , diagnosis and vaccine development were cited as the reasons for the experiments .
The , March 9 , 1977 , reported other experiments during which the military sprayed bacteria in New York City subways , in a Washington D.C. airport , and on highways in Pennsylvania .
Military bases in Virginia , Key West , and off the coasts of Southern California and Hawaii have used live bacteria tests on U.S. civilians .
In 1992 , a strike at Plum of union engineers was responsible for a loss of essential support services such as decontamination , waste - water treatment , generator maintenance , and other maintenance and safety - oriented functions .
For the duration of the strike , temporary workers were brought in to replace the sentinels and technicians of the infrastructure .
The water pressure fell precipitously disabling decontamination facilities and the necropsy rooms where dead animals were examined .
In the fifth month of the strike a power failure occurred during which a worker called a Hillary Clinton staffer to complain that the facility was completely out of hand .
Without power , the air filtration systems were inoperable , and the decontamination procedures stopped .
The seals in the pressurized airlock doors deflated , and workers reportedly tried to seal them with duct tape .
In 1999 , the administrator of the Agriculture Research Service persuaded President Clinton to include Plum in his expanded bio-terrorism program based on the possibility of a biological attack on the nation 's agricultural base .
In 2001 it was discovered that Plum was involved in an effort to develop vaccine resistant forms of anthrax .
Two years later a virologist at St. Louis University announced he was creating a more lethal form of mousepox , a relative of smallpox , and intended to extend his work to cowpox which can infect humans .
The problem with research of countermeasures is that they need the lethal measure to go against .
Creating deadly bio-weapons to determine how well they can be thwarted gives rise to the potential of more potent plagues .
The government 's budget for chemical / biological warfare has recently doubled , with $ 10 billion allocated to bio- weaponry projects .
These incidents are a record of what has become known in spite of all attempts to retain security and secrecy .
It is obviously not the full extent of the U.S. government 's bio -warfare or bio -weapon testing on its citizens .
The full extent of this involvement is hidden in classified documents or is reported to be unavailable .
The appearance in the past several years of AIDS , Legionnaire 's disease , hepatitis C , mad cow , hemorrhagic viruses , Lassa fever , chronic fatigue syndrome , Persian Gulf War illness and others have made people question their sources .
Older diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria and cholera have re-emerged in more virulent forms that are drug resistant .
A study published in the January 6 , 1999reported infectious disease mortality in the U.S. declined during the first eight decades of the 20th century .
From 1981 to 1995 , there was an increase in infectious disease mortality of fifty - eight percent .
The researchers concluded that recent increases emphasize the dynamic nature of infectious diseases and the need for preparedness to address them .
The official list of excuses for this rising mortality rate makes no mention of the infectious material produced for biological warfare purposes .
The anthrax mailings following the attacks of 9/11 have been the only wake - up call that has reached many Americans .
It raised the level of public fear enough to spark congressional increase in spending on bio-defense , but it quickly faded from the public mind .
About the same time as this funding was increased , the West Nile virus was dismissed by a government report as not being bio - warfare , a move surprising many people given the government 's long and documented history of bio - warfare experimentation on its own citizens .
Killer microbes have been for sale to any person or country having the buying power .
While the U.S. was still friendly with Iraq , the Education Ministry bought 70 shipments of anthrax and other disease - causing organisms from the U.S.
Officials here continued to supply Iraq with bio - warfare material during the prelude to the Gulf War according to the September 24 , 2002 People wonder whether the West Nile virus could be the result of animal experimentation and the laboratory manipulation of the African virus .
In September , 2002 , the media reported that some West Nile patients exhibited signs and symptoms of polio , although that disease is caused by a different virus .
They ask if this means the virus has been laboratory altered .
West Nile is generally only fatal in the old and the sick , groups being eyed by the government for their use of entitlements .
The Poison Plum ( 2006 ) is a novelized historical treatise of the Lyme disease now sweeping across the U.S. Recorded incidence of this puzzling illness without a cure shows it to be the fastest spreading disease in America today .
From the politics of disease to the agenda of the powerful , the book reveals the betrayal of the nation and its people by their own most trusted institutions .
It is a dark portent of the pain and suffering to come as Lyme disease and the escalation of bio - warfare continue .
The book is a testimony to the veil of secrecy surrounding Lyme , a veil that took ten years for the author to penetrate before he finally received his own Lyme diagnosis .
It is a mesmerizing and powerful tale that speaks of truths that are only palatable when presented in the form of a story .
The connections between Lyme and Plum are probed , as well as the involvement of government laboratories in engineering germs for use in biological warfare .
Other questions raised involve the possibility of massive government cover-ups to deny the true severity of Lyme disease and the fact that there is no cure , as well as the involvement of insurance companies denying the complexity of the disease to avoid liability for costly long term treatment protocols .

According to Rasmussen , “ 62 % of adults say there should be a nationwide ban on smoking in all public places , according to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey .
Thirty - three percent ( 33 % ) disagree , and five percent ( 5 % ) are not sure . ”
Here comes the money line :
Republicans , who usually frown on government restrictions , are more emphatic about the need for a nationwide smoking ban than Democrats , 66 % to 59 % .
Sixty - one percent ( 61 % ) of those not affiliated with either party agree .
Sixty - four percent ( 64 % ) of whites favor such a ban , compared to 50 % of African - Americans .
In mid-December , 22 % of U.S. voters said the federal government should outlaw tobacco smoking .

Here ’s a quick thought for the Nannystatists ( of any political persuasion ) out there :
When the Nannystatists came for the smokers ,
I remained silent ;
I was not a smoker .
When they locked up the drinkers ,
I remained silent ;
I do n’t drink alcoholic beverages .
When they came for the sex toys ,
I did not speak out ;
I do n’t use sex toys .
When they came to ban guns ,
I remained silent ;
I do n’t like guns .
When they came to ban free speech ,
I did n’t say a word ;
As I no longer had a gun to protect myself .
When they came for me ,
there were so few individual liberties or civil rights remaining , there was no way for me to defend myself from the government .
VAWA casts a long shadow over the Duke fiasco By Carey Roberts
web posted April 30 , 2007
Was prosecutor Michael Nifong simply an over - rated ambulance chaser who rose to his level of incompetence ?
Was he a scheming opportunist who needed to boost his flagging re-election chances ?
Or did his dogged prosecution of the Duke Three reflect a deeper , more systemic problem in our criminal justice system ?
Here 's the dirty little secret of D.A.s who prosecute sexual assault and domestic violence cases : many of the claims they pursue are as flaky as a pie crust and their chances of winning a jury conviction are slim .
So why do they bother to go after the case ?
Because – get ready for this -- they believe " we are encouraging abused women to come forward and confront their oppressors . "
So according to that neo -Marxist logic , if we want to get really tough on say , bank robbers , what we need to do is randomly accuse innocent persons of burglary and then parade them through the streets , denouncing them for a crime they did not commit .
Of course , rape is a terrible crime .
Equally terrible are false allegations of rape .
According to Linda Fairstein , former head of the New York County District Attorney 's Sex Crimes Unit , " There are about 4,000 reports of rape each year in Manhattan .
Of these , about half simply did not happen . "
But sadly , many innocent men have been wrongfully put behind bars .
Just last week Jerry Miller of Chicago was exonerated after serving 24 years for a rape he did n't commit .
His release helped inspire a national campaign dubbed " 200 Exonerated , Too Many Wrongfully Convicted , " an effort designed to spur state reforms of the criminal justice system .
Many persons have heard of the Violence Against Women Act -- VAWA for short .
But most are unaware of the extent to which VAWA - mandated programs have biased our judiciary and chipped away at the presumption of innocent until proven guilty .
VAWA 's tentacles reach deep and wide , reshaping our nation 's laws on immigration , welfare , and public housing .
The Act defines domestic violence broadly , so sexual assault and rape fall within its purview .
VAWA authorizes $ 50 million each year for its Sexual Assault Services Program , which contributed to the Duke fiasco in many ways .
First , VAWA pays the legal bills of alleged victims of sexual assault .
Want to guess how much money goes to help men accused of rape ?
Nada .
That sets the stage for a prosecutorial shake - down that works like this :
Find a guy who can't afford a million - dollar legal defense team .
Smear his good name with an accusation of rape .
Then settle for a plea bargain conviction on a lesser count of sexual assault .
The attorneys get their money and the D.A. can add another notch to his ( or her ) belt .
Second , did you wonder why Michael Nifong never required accuser Crystal Gail Mangum to take a polygraph test ?
Simple : the Violence Against Women
Act prohibits it .
Section 2013 states , " no law enforcement officer , prosecuting officer , or other government official shall ask or require an adult , youth , or child victim of an alleged sex offense … to submit to a polygraph examination or other truth telling device . "
Third , VAWA funds training programs for prosecutors , judges , and law enforcement personnel .
To say the content of these programs lacks a scientific basis is generous .
This past November the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence sponsored a conference .
First one of the speakers made light of a Florida incident in which a young man was sexually assaulted by a female teacher .
The presenter then turned around and used the terms " scum bag " and " douche bag " to refer to men accused of abuse .
At an earlier New Jersey training session , one presenter openly encouraged judges to ignore due process protections : " Your job is not to become concerned about all the constitutional rights of the man that you 're violating as you grant a restraining order .
Throw him out on the street , give him the clothes on his back , and tell him , ‘ See ya ' around . ' "
Fourth , VAWA 's overly - aggressive prosecution measures have been found to be flatly ineffective in stopping abuse .
Still , these measures have instilled a legal of climate of " every man is a potential rapist " – ignoring the equally ridiculous corollary that " every woman is a potential false accuser . "
Fifth , VAWA 's unstated belief that women can only be victims dissuades prosecutors from going after false accusers .
As Massachusetts district attorney David Angier once argued , " If anyone is prosecuted for filing a false report , then victims of real attacks will be less likely to report them . "
And failing to prosecute women who make malicious accusations only means that men will continue to be falsely accused , charged , prosecuted , convicted , sentenced , and jailed .

How Jerry Pournelle got kicked off the ARPANET

Stacy < CSTACY @ MIT -MC > Subject : TACACS To : REM @ MIT-MC , BANDY @ MIT-MC , DEVON @ MIT-MC , DIGEX @ MIT-MC , JURGEN @ MIT-MC , PINTO @ MIT-MC , POURNE @ MIT-MC , KFL @ MIT-MC , STEVEH @ MIT-MC , GUMBY @ MIT-MC , IAN @ SRI - NIC cc : USER - ACCOUNTS @ MIT-MC
Hi ,
I did n't see your original messages , and I do n't know how the NIC got into the loop , but I am indeed the person to answer your questions .
Apparently you have encountered TAC access control ( TACACS ) on your favorite MILNET TAC .
TACACS is a login system based on encrpytion codes recorded on little paper cards which authorized MILNET TAC users are being issued .
To be a MILNET TAC user , you must have a personal TACACS account and be issued one of these cards , so that you can type your login code to the TAC and make it happy .
People establish TACACS accounts and get cards by contacting me to get registered .
If you stick to using ARPAnet TACs , you will have no trouble , since TACACS for the ARPAnet is going to be a little different and has not been completely figured out yet .
MIT is not sponsoring guest / tourist usage of the MILNET ; if you are a guest , you should just switch to using a TAC on the ARPAnet and avoid the problem .
I can provide you the name of an ARPAnet TAC in your area , but I can not authorize you to use it or provide you with telephone dialup numbers .
I will soon have some " Guest TACACS cards " for authorized MIT people on our machines who need to use a MILNET TAC but have not yet been registered for their own personal cards .
These cards are confusingly named : they have nothing to do with guest accounts and are not available to tourists / guests .
To put it straight : in general , you are up a creek , and there really is n't very much to be done about it .
Feel free to ask me further questions or whatever though .
Cheers , Chris

There are eight people on user -a .
You probably know better than I do , but last I heard about 100,000 times as many people read BYTE .

I do n't particularly want to force you into ritual disembowelment ; rather , I 'm interested -- and I 'm not the only one -- in why you find it necessary to flaunt your use of the arpanet .
The more attention you ( and other people ) draw to non -blow - em - up use of the arpanet the more likely some Proxmire type is to start inquiring into its operations .

ARPA Re : WESTERCON 38 and The Pournelle / ARPANET Split
We attended the WESTERCON 38 SF convention held in Sacramento , CA , over the July 4th weekend .
At WESTERCON we talked with Jerry Pournelle about why he never contributed to the SF - LOVERS bb since he had an account at MIT - MC .
He said his account at MIT - MC was terminated by some " graduate student " in charge of accounting , who felt he did not have a need for an account .
He knows who this " graduate student " is , and he refuses to grovel so that his account is reinstated .
However , he asked us to broadcast this little story - presumably so that MIT - MC will come to him .
BTW - if you ever get a chance to meet Jerry Pournelle , you will not be dissappointed .
Sequel to FOOTFALL :-)
HARPANET FOR PRESIDENT ,
HUSENET FOR VICE - PRESIDENT .
Also planned is a sequel ( and a prequel ) to THE MOTE IN GOD'S EYE .
WESTERCON 38 was run very well .
In addition to Jerry , we spent several hours talking with Greg Bear , Norman Spinrad , Robert Adams , James P. Hogan , Larry Niven , John Brunner , and David Brin .

He might still have an account if he could keep from using words like ARPANET and DARPA in his column in BYTE magazine !

I 'll take care of this , but I thought you might be amused by it .
You might consider contacting Byte about publishing some note from us to appear simultaneously with this .
This is only important if pournelle is going to say what I think he is going to say ( what JMC told me pournelle was claiming ) , which is that the reason his account was flushed was because he favors the Strategic Defense Initiative , and MC is run by a bunch of communists .
This will no doubt please darpa immensely .
Pournelle claims that he heard at a science fiction convention that you ( chris ) had said that the real reason his account was flushed was that ``he ( pournelle ) is a fascist . ''
Given the current political climate , this could raise some sort of ruckus , so it would probably be good to nip this in the bud .

All we have to to is warn Byte that MIT will sue the magazine if any incorrect defamatory comments are made by Pournelle .
I am sure the editors there have the same opinion of him that we do and will make sure that Pournelle does n't end them up in court .
As it stands Pournelle really does n't understand the state of the world .
If he insists on printing his delusions then MIT 's case would be trivial to win .

Leigh read me some of Mr. Pournelle 's expose ' of the ARPAnet .
He pretty much said that , due to increased demands on computational resources , guest accounts are no longer generally available on MC , thereby saving Chris some typing .
Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 10/2/2009 ( 4249 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
Opinion
What would the late Sen .
Eugene Forsey have said about last December 's parliamentary prorogation ?
It was a subversion of the Constitution and a flagrant contempt of Parliament .
Helen Forsey , the daughter of Canada 's most respected constitutional and parliamentary authority , has answered the question parliamentary scholars have been asking one another ever since that controversial decision .
She has done more .
She has collected and annotated her father 's published research on what she calls the " 10 constitutional fairy tales " surrounding the so - called constitutional crisis and the much - reviled coalition between the Liberals and the New Democrats supported by the Bloc Quebecois .
" At no time in recent history has the need for my father 's constitutional and historical expertise been more acute , " Ms. Forsey writes in the introduction to her online essay for HistoryWire.ca , a new website created by the Historica Foundation of Canada .
" In the 18 years since his death , ignorance of Canada 's system of government has proven to be a growth industry , involving the media , various academics and many of the politicians themselves .
" The result is that much if not most of what passes for fact on the subject of Parliament , minority government , prorogation , elections and so on , is actually completely false .
Worse yet , much of it is subversive of our Constitution and frankly dangerous to ' peace , order and good government . ' "
Forsey recalls her father saying " I shall have to spend my declining years compiling and debunking a collection of constitutional fairy tales .
And it will have to be loose - leaf , because there 's a fresh one every day . "
The late senator would have denounced Gov. Gen. Michäelle Jean 's decision to grant Prime Minister Stephen Harper a two - month parliamentary prorogation to avoid his defeat on a non-confidence motion .
A governor general " cannot allow " a prime minister to stop the House of Commons from " performing its most essential function , " he wrote .
To permit a prime minister to do that would be " to subvert the Constitution . "
Forsey went further .
For a governor - general to grant a prime minister prorogation or an election to avoid defeat makes the Crown " an accomplice in a flagrant act of contempt for Parliament . "
In fact , he continued , a governor general faced with such a request should " if necessary , dismiss such government . "
He mocked the view that a constitutional crisis is created and a new election is automatic every time a government faces defeat .
" We shall certainly have to get rid of the notion that every defeat in the House means a fresh election ...
If a government knows it may be hanged in a fortnight , the knowledge may broaden its mind wonderfully .
Having to get support from outside its own party may not only help a government do good and sensible things , but also prevent it from doing bad and foolish things . "
He also mocked the idea that Parliament is " not working " and " dysfunctional " if the opposition actively opposes its program .
" Opposition parties ... get money for research .
Why ?
Because we want criticism , we want watchfulness , we want the possibility of an effective alternative government if we are displeased with the one we have . "
Forsey rejected another popular notion that a change of government by majority vote in Parliament is undemocratic -- a " seizure of power " , a " coup " , in the prime minister 's words .
" Responsible cabinet government means government by a cabinet with a majority in the House of Commons ...
The only way to find out is by summoning Parliament and letting it vote .
It is not for ( the governor general ) to decide who shall form the government .
It is for the House of Commons . "
The current accepted fact that the passage of three and a half months since the October 2008 election automatically entitles Harper to an election if he is defeated was also shot down by Forsey .
" In a Parliament which is recently elected , if one government cannot carry on with the existing House , and an alternative government is possible ... then the government ... should resign and make way for one that can . "
And he ridiculed the widespread conviction that " stability " and " efficiency " are the highest political values and since minority governments supposedly can't provide them , the sole purpose of elections is to produce majority governments .
" The official theory has seemed to be that ... electors have just done their sums wrong and must be made to do it over again until they get it right ...
We may have to learn to live with minority government ...
( I ) t may turn out to give us quite tolerable or even very good legislation and administration ... "
Based on her father 's research , Ms. Forsey herself rejects another " truth " , manufactured last fall , that no coalition can legitimately govern unless the parties explicitly campaigned as one in the election .
" Representative government means we elect our representatives to make decisions about governing .
If an election gives no party a majority and the existing cabinet does not have the confidence of the House of Commons , the democratically - elected opposition MPs should try to work together to transact public business with an alternative government ... "

In the last four months , technology companies have shed more than 200,000 jobs -- most eliminated in the last month alone .
Vendors such as Microsoft , Intel , NEC , Hitachi and even Google top the list of companies cutting jobs .
Since the beginning of the year , technology vendors have eliminated more than 124,000 jobs as weak earnings and dismal revenue forecasts force companies into conservative , constricted postures .
This makes January the worst month of job losses since the recession began .
In the four months Channel Insider has been tracking technology job losses , nearly 205,000 technology jobs have been eliminated under the weight of the contracting economy .
Hitachi—a Japan - based company — announced its expectations to post a full - year net loss of $ 7.8 billion ( 700 billion yen ) , compared with a previous forecast of 15 billion yen .
Hitachi , which makes everything from flat - screen televisions to high - end storage systems to power systems , said it will cut 7,000 jobs , reduce costs and freeze capital expenses .
NEC Corp. , a computer - system and chip maker , is forecasting a net loss for the fiscal year ending March , stated it will cut 20,000 jobs over the next 12 months .
In a press conference announcing the work force reduction , NEC President Kaoru Yano said the company will " consider any possible measures " to restore its ailing semiconductor operations to health .
Showing pressure from the weak economy and migration of customers to cloud - based application services , Microsoft revealed plans to eliminate more than 5,000 jobs over the next 18 months .
CEO Steve Ballmer said most of the reductions will come from eliminating redundant positions .
Though a painful move , Ballmer and other Microsoft officials said the job cuts are necessary to align the company for future opportunities .
January has been the single largest month for layoff announcements globally , with technology jobs representing 16 percent of the total numbers .
The largest source of tech job cuts comes from electronics retailer and service provider Circuit City , which is liquidating and going out of business after failing to restructure its debt .
As a result , 34,000 full - and part - time employees will lose their jobs when the company ’s remaining 567 stores close .
Even some of the strongest brands in the technology market are cutting jobs either after reporting losses or adjusting to anticipated market pressures .
Ericsson , Google , Intel , Philips and Sprint / Nextel will each cut 5,000 or more full - time and contractor positions .
The global technology cuts are going deeper than in previous recessions .
Japanese technology companies are reporting earnings with expectations to lose more than 1.5 trillion yen in the fiscal year ending March 31 , 2009 .
These companies have announced plans to cut a total of nearly 50,000 full - time and temporary jobs in locations around the world .
Technology manufacturers are hitting the brakes hard .
Previously , the Japanese government announced that preliminary industrial production fell 9.6 percent in December from a month ago and further stated it expects sharp declines to continue into 2009 .
Exports reports show a record 35 percent reduction year over year in December .
The following is a list of technology companies that have either eliminated jobs or slated jobs for elimination , as tracked by Channel Insider .
WASHINGTON 
In a pair of unanimous decisions written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. , the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in favor of the parents of a girl who said she had been molested on a school bus and against a drug dealer whose home was searched after he invited a police informant inside .
The court also let stand without comment a lower court ruling striking down the Child Online Protection Act , putting an end to a decade of litigation .
The law had made it a crime for commercial Web sites to make sexually explicit materials available to children under 17 .
The case involving the student , a girl in kindergarten in Hyannis , Mass. , started when she told her parents she was being sexually harassed by an 8 - year - old boy every time she wore a dress or skirt to school .
Her parents , dissatisfied with the school ’s response to their complaints , sued under two federal laws .
The federal appeals court in Boston ruled against the parents on both claims .
It said the parents could not win under Title IX , which bars sex discrimination in schools that receive federal money , because they could not prove the school system had acted unreasonably .
And the parents could not invoke an older and broader civil rights law known as Section 1983 , the appeals court said , because “ Congress saw Title IX as the sole means of vindicating the right to be free from gender discrimination perpetrated by educational institutions . ”

Chinese automaker to sell cars at Wal - Mart , Costco ?
A number of major Chinese automakers have plans to sell low - cost cars in America , but so far none of those ambitions have materialized .
Most of the companies have struggled to meet U.S. crash regulations , not to mention build vehicles with the ' fit and finish ' to which Americans are accustomed .
Another hurdle is setting up a dealership network to sell the cars -- not an easy task .
But according to one manufacturer , Chinese automakers could have that problem solved :
Within the next few years , you might be able to buy a Chinese car at a big - box retailer like Wal - Mart or Costco .
The news comes from Kathleen Ligocki , CEO of GS Motors .
A subsidiary of Grupo Salinas , GS Motors is not a Chinese automaker .
Rather , it is a Mexican manufacturing company that intends to build Chinese automobiles for the North American and South American markets .
Yes , that includes the United States .
Currently , GS imports cars from Chin's First Auto Works ( FAW ) to Mexico .
The companies are currently working together on an assembly plant in the country .
The compact ' F1 Hatchback ' model , on sale this year , will retail for less than $ 5,500 .
GS expects to begin production in Mexico some time in 2010 , Ligocki told China 's Gasgoo news service .
The company will begin with sales in Mexico and Latin America , but plans to make inroads to the United States in the next few years .
GS is already using big - box stores in Mexico -- like Wal - Mart and Costco -- to sell FAW vehicles .
The company would likely use a similar strategy in America , forgoing setting up an expensive dealership network .
Several hundred families filed a class- action suit Friday against two Pennsylvania judges who pleaded guilty on Thursday to accepting $ 2.6 million in kickbacks for sending juveniles to private detention facilities .
“ At the hands of two grossly corrupt judges and several conspirators , hundreds of Pennsylvania children , their families and loved ones , were victimized and their civil rights were violated , ” said Michael J. Cefalo , one of the lawyers representing the families .
“ It ’s our intent to make sure that the system rights this terrible injustice and holds those responsible accountable . ”
Pennsylvania lawmakers called on Friday for hearings into the state ’s juvenile justice system .
And the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia , which blew the whistle on the judges , said it had sworn affidavits from families who said they had sought court - appointed counsel but were told that their children would have to wait weeks , sometimes months , for a lawyer .
During that time , the children would have to remain in detention , the families said .
The two judges , Mark A. Ciavarella Jr. and Michael T. Conahan , pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Scranton , Pa. , to wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud the United States for taking more than $ 2.6 million in kickbacks to send teenagers to two privately run youth detention centers run by PA Child Care and a sister company , Western PA Child Care .
Their plea agreements call for sentences of more than seven years in prison .
I have a cold ( and they 're worse than you remember when you 're well ) .
Throughout the nation , homeopaths and self - declared nutrition therapists are celebrating .
More importantly , I know that there is almost nothing I can do , except sit it out , and wait .
Vitamin C will shave a few hours off it , at high doses , like 7g a day , which I can happily live without .
Although literally anything I try will appear , to me , to work : because unless I 'm seroconverting with HIV ( not that I 'm prone to hypochondria ) I will get better anyway .
This is the natural history of the illness , and it 's true with most things .
When your back pain is at its worst and you visit your doctor - or your friendly local spoonbender - it 's bound to get better , because these things come in cycles , or as statisticians say , they " regress to the mean " .
You can look at regression to the mean mathematically , if you like .
On Bruce Forsyth 's Play Your Cards Right , when Brucey puts a three on the board , the audience all shout : " Higher ! " because they know the odds are that the next card is going to be higher than a three .
" Do you want to go higher or lower than a jack ?
Higher ? " " Lower ! "
So I could take homeopathy .
Or I could , equally stupidly , harass my GP for antibiotics , even though they are ineffective in treating a viral cold .
In one study , prescribing antibiotics rather than giving advice on self - management for sore throat resulted in an increased overall workload through repeat attendance .
If a GP prescribed antibiotics for sore throat to 100 fewer patients each year , they calculated : 33 fewer would believe that antibiotics were effective , 25 fewer would intend to consult with the problem in the future , and 10 fewer would come back within the next year .
If you were an alternative therapist , or a drug salesman , you could turn those figures on their head and use them as a blueprint to drum up more trade : because we are all prone to see patterns where there is none , and more than that , to believing that our actions have results .
This was demonstrated in a chilling experiment several decades ago .
Subjects were recruited to play the role of a teacher trying to make a child arrive on time for school at 8.30 am .
They sat at a computer , on which it appeared that each day , for 15 consecutive days , a child would arrive at some time between 8.20 and 8.40 .
Since this was a psychology experiment , the subjects were lied to : they did not know that the arrival times were entirely random , and predetermined before the experiment began .
Nevertheless , participants thoughtfully deployed punishments for lateness , and rewards for punctuality .
When they were asked at the end to rate their strategy , 70 % concluded that reprimand was more effective than reward in producing punctuality from the child .
It 's a touching testament to their own beliefs about the world .
These people were convinced that their actions had an impact on the punctuality of the child , even though the arrival time was entirely random .
The joy is , you have no way of knowing how many areas of your life this experiment might be relevant to .
Now I 'm going to dangle some goat entrails around my neck and get chanting .

Red Bull Racing has put together a sweet animated video explaining the new rules Formula 1 has adopted for the 2009 season .
Even if you are n't into F1 , it 's cool to see .
Formula 1 has adopted the most sweeping changes in the sport 's history in an effort to increase overtaking and bring down the astronomical costs involved in racing .
As we told you a couple of weeks ago , the new rules have significantly changed how the cars look .
The rules effect everything from aerodynamics to tires to the number of engines each team can use during the season , which spans 17 races over 9 months .

A controversial policy requiring researchers to make their papers freely available to the public at a U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH )
Web site is facing a potential road block .
Last week , members of a powerful House committee held the first - ever congressional hearing on the policy and floated a proposal to overturn it .
Law professor Ralph Oman of George Washington University in Washington , D.C. , argued that NIH 's policy is a " dilution of the rights of the copyright owners " and " will destroy the commercial market " for science and technology journals .
From Science Breathe .
Think about this .
NIH sponsored research was supposed to be freely available in an open access format ( PubMed Central ) , under the intricate logic that if taxpayers funded it , they should be able to read it .
ButWell , duh .
That 's obvious , and by obvious I mean , of course , a red herring .
Do n't make the mistake of thinking this has anything to do with maintaining a journal 's revenue stream .
They certainly did n't complain when Pharma sponsored studies had to have their data open access .
So why would they care about NIH open access ?
Apparently , it costs a journal $ 4000 per article to publish it , at 50 % gross margins .
I have no idea where that money goes -- the authors get nothing for writing the article , and peer reviewers get nothing for reading them -- but that 's enough reason to destroy this unnecessary system .
The mistake is thinking that open access is a threat to a .
The trickis : subscriptions are paid by big buyers ( e.g. universities ) , and they do n't get to choose what they are subscribing to .
You buy the Elsevier Package , and you get whatever crap journals they happen to be offering .
Say you want only - $ 600 / year .
Too bad -- it 's coupled to , at $ 23,000 / year .
I defy anyone to disagree that there has never been , and never will be , a finding inworth $ 23,000 .
Universities will pay whatever it costs to get the crap journals in which their NIH sponsored research is published , even if they also have to buy the other crap journals .
Open access articles is n't nearly as big a threat to publishers as simply unbundling the journals from each other , letting universities decide which ones to buy .
So open access does n't threaten subscription revenues , it threatensthey can publish .
It 's the multitude of journals , each with its inflated subscription rate , that brings in the real money .
Also , each crap journal carries advertisements ; even a crap journal with a small niche can have higher ad rates because of the bundling .
Elsevier alone made $ 3B in revenue last year .
That 's a lot of business to be at risk , by science .
II .
But wait : this is a bill blocking the block the open access policy of the NIH that was put in place last year .
Why were n't researchers putting their stuff up on the internet , anyway ?
Just for fun ?
Why did n't each lab simply create a website and reprint everything ?
It would take no work -- I assume they did n't write out their findings longhand with a quill .
It is technically a violation of copyright , but have you ever heard of a journal coming after the author of a paper for violating copyright ?
Me neither .
The answer is that a lot of the payoff of research is the publication itself .
Where it gets published often matters much morethan what was actually discovered .
Research is often conducted with a journal in mind and " what 's hot " in a field --- as decided by the members of the editorial board of the journal , who decide based on their particular interests ( read : funding streams and prejudices . )
BTW , these are often the same guys who are grant reviewers .
This almost completely drives decisions " on the ground " on what to study and what not to study .
( Or did science sufficiently crack the mysteries of lithium to warrant a complete move to Depakote ? ) Would anything in AJP be worth reading if it was n't actually in AJP ?
If you think about it , the entire past 15 years in psychiatry have produced no discoveries at all .
None .
We have different medicines , okay ; but they 're not better , just different .
We do n't have a better handle on the anatomic or genetic or anything causes of anything -- we 're not even any further along in defining our terms .
Thousands of articles rehashing the same old ground have kept thousands of academics employed , to no benefit whatsoever for mankind .
Take away the journals and the system collapses .
Force researchers with NIH grants to publish their findings without the marketing and packaging of a journal , and you 've effectively halted half of the NIH research , until anotherof researchers with a different research model show up for work .
For sure , unquestionably , you 've killed off psychiatry as it functions today .
The academic research system is flawed because it does not incentivize research , it incentivizes the process of research .
Academic research is a bubble , money keeps flowing into it as long as it produces quality research .
Who decides quality ?
Journals are the rating agencies , Moody's , they keep it sustainable by giving it AAA rating .
The ratings agencies are precisely what keeps the bubble inflated , just like with the mortgages , they are what keeps research money pouring into the system .
If someone could look behind the ratings , and take measure of the actual value of the research , the bubble would pop faster than , well , you get the idea .
Then there 's the " systemic risk . "
Journals collapse , academic centers collapse from lack of funding , Pharma loses the AAA rating on their studies which are done by academics , published in journals , etc.
Research would be forced to change completely -- and for the better .
But you 'll have a decade or so recession in science and education while the old generation dies out and the new one becomes old enough to start work .

Final column - at least for a while With Good Reason By Father Thomas Berg December 21 , 2010
9:00 am EST
Final column - at least for a while
December 21 , 2010 9:00 am I penned my first ' With Good Reason ' column a bit over four years ago in November of 2006 .
At the time , my hope was to make a solid contribution toward curbing our cultural malaise which is , in myriad ways , so adverse to reasoned consideration of our beliefs , policies and behaviors .
Such a culture - as I suggested at the time - cannot sustain for long a thriving and well - ordered democratic way of life .
And so it is , in that deeper - than - usual nostalgia and spirit of reflection which envelopes most of us ( or me at least ) at this time of year , that I now sit me down to pen my final WGR column .
No , I have not given up on the battle for reasoned discourse in the public square !
On the contrary , of late I have had reason to be encouraged .
And over the past four years , there have been any number of indicators that reasoned public discourse on moral matters is experiencing a refreshing revival of sorts .
One might consider , for example , howbaby hand the advent of embryonic stem cell research occasioned the lively and vigorous public debate about the moral status of the human embryo , a debate that had been effectively squelched during the first decades of the debate over abortion .
In ending my monthly columns , I am certainly not disappearing from the ethics scene .
On the contrary , other commitments ( the ethics boards on which I sit , research and writing commitments - including my hopes of publishing a book or two - as well as teaching and pastoral work ) are simply occupying my time to such an extent that I have elected to give them greater attention .
Publishing will continue , of course , albeit in other venues .
But back to that reflective mood .
I write on a day that the headlines tell us : Liu XiaoboChinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo ( himself jailed and his wife under house arrest ) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in absentia in Oslo ; pressure mounts in Washington to cut federal spending as lawmakers finally step up to take action at the prospect of hitting national bankruptcy by 2025 ; 16 year - olds are conducting a cyber war on major American businesses ; scientists have created a mouse whose genetic makeup comes from two males ; the debate over the military 's ' Do n't Ask Don't Tell ' policy is at the forefront on Capitol Hill even as our service men and women continue to be killed by IED's ; and North Korean aggression toward South Korea is growing , not diminishing .
Plenty to write about .
Truly , there 's never an end to the challenges facing humanity and which call for reasoned moral discourse in the public square .
Looking back on four years of non-stop " issues " to which I dedicated my key pad and best mental energies , I can't help but wonder again at those enduring questions that underlie the issues :
What is truth ?
Why am I here ?
Why do we suffer ?
Is there a God ?
Now , if truth be told , any day of the week , we can glance at the news and wonder if the headlines do not portend a new and rapidly advancing dark age , or whether - as the philosopher Aladair MacIntyre already opined three decades ago in his now classic After Virtue - that the new dark age is already upon us , and whether its barbarian doyens " are not waiting beyond the frontiers [ but ] have already been governing us for quite some time . "
However one parses the present age , as Christians we are called - in the spirit of St. Augustine - to sing , and not curse the darkness , as we strive to build the City of God , and journey toward the consummation of all times .
We are called to hope , and hope entails patient expectation .
To borrow again from MacIntyre , however , we are certainly not waiting for Godot ; Christian expectation is infused , through and through , with meaning .
As to MacIntyre 's suggestion that we are rather awaiting a new St. Benedict , well , that would surely be nice .
But far more importantly , all of us are hopefully awaiting " the blessed hope - the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior , Jesus Christ . "
He alone is the Word of the Father , the Logos through whom all things were made .
He alone is the font of Wisdom in whom we participate through our right use of reason .
He alone is the ultimate answer to the deepest questions of the human heart .
That 's why , at Christmas 2010 we cry , once again : " Marana tha ! Come Lord Jesus ! "
God bless you .
And ... P.S.... As one smidgen of that hope , treat yourself to a Merry Christmas !
Mission
The Westchester Institute for Ethics & the Human Person is a research institute conducting interdisciplinary , natural law analysis of complex , contemporary moral issues yet unresolved among Judeo - Christian scholars .
Anchored in the classic perennial and Catholic view of the human person , our moral inquires are first and foremost of a scholarly nature .
However , we pursue answers to these disputed questions with an eye toward enriching the quality of contemporary moral discourse , and fostering sound prudential judgment in cultural and political matters .
We are currently dedicated to the following issues :
The genesis of human life & the moral status of the human embryo
The search for scientifically and morally feasible alternatives to embryo - based biomedical research
The use of emergency contraception in rape protocols
The determination of human death , and end - of - life issues
The relationship between religion , science , and reason as sources of moral insight for modern society .
The Westchester Institute and its scholars have become a distinguished resource and point of reference for think - tanks , centers for applied research , and institutes of public policy analysis .
Together , we seek to make a significant contribution to the common good and to contemporary culture .
From the Director
Fr Thomas Berg
Director , Westchester Institute " History itself is speeding up on so rapid a course that individuals can scarcely keep pace with it .
And so the human race is passing from a relatively static conception of the scheme of things to a more dynamic and evolutionary conception - whence there arises a new set of problems , calling for new analyses and new syntheses . "
These words , penned just over forty years ago in the Second Vatican Council document Gaudium et Spes ( n. 5 ) , were most prescient .
Nowhere today are we more acutely faced with a " new set of problems calling for new analyses and new syntheses " than in the moral arena .
Brave New World is now upon us .
And on a larger scale , as the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre has pointed out , the loss of the sense of a common human narrative - that is , the loss of that worldview which had shaped western self - understanding until the modern age - has deprived Western culture of the context that made its moral precepts meaningful , and indeed reasonable .
The skepticism regnant in so many sectors of academia has burdened the life of the mind for far too long .
The result has been a fragmentation and unnecessary antagonism between the branches of learning .
The consequent breakdown in dialogue has only contributed to the broader erosion of the concept of truth .
The Westchester Institute , through its multiple venues and scholarly endeavors , hopes to contribute - in collegial collaboration with so many other like - minded institutions - to a new moral synthesis that our times require , a synthesis anchored in the classic " perennial " and Catholic view of the human person .
We are convinced that democratic society - particularly as understood in the American experience - can only flourish on the basis of a thriving moral culture .
A primary ingredient of such a moral culture is moral reflection : a habit of fostering ethical analysis , both personally and on a societal level , of living an examined life , of assuring that sustained and rational discussion of fundamental moral problems is welcomed in the public square .
It is central to the mission of The Westchester Institute to uphold and foster such a moral culture .
We welcome you to our new website and we look forward to serving you in the pursuit of moral truth
Director of Programs
Michelle Gress
Director of Programs
" We are most fortunate to have Michelle on board with us , " said Fr. Thomas Berg , Executive Director of the Institute .
" Michelle brings with her not only a rich background of experience , but a real passion for the mission of the Institute .

Research Areas
The Westchester Institute and its scholars have become a distinguished resource and point of reference for think - tanks , centers for applied research , and institutes of public policy analysis .
We are currently dedicated to the following issues :
The genesis of human life & the moral status of the human embryo ; the search for scientifically and morally feasible alternatives to embryo - based biomedical research ; the use of emergency contraception in rape protocols ; the determination of human death , and end - of - life issues ; the relationship between religion , science , and reason as sources of moral insight for modern society .
These are some of the research areas in which we are currently engaged :
Emergency Contraception : Emergency contraception has been a controversial topic for many years , stemming from the potential mode of action of preventing an embryo from properly implanting in the womb , thereby causing an early abortion .
Scientific studies examining emergency contraception cannot eliminate early abortion as one potential mode of action , though prevention of ovulation is the most common effect of emergency contraception .
The Westchester Institute is currently investigating this area , and will release a White Paper on the topic in early 2009 .
Alternatives to embryo - based biomedical research : The Westchester Institute is actively engaged in the moral evaluation of some of the most promising alternatives to embryo destructive research .
Alternative Sources
The Westchester Institute is currently working on a project that aims to use social research to shed light on the debilitating effects of internet p*rn .
We believe that conducting an in - depth and well - designed study will provide valuable social research in an understudied area that has had profound effects on the family and society .
With Good Reason By Father Thomas Berg Committed Catholics in the Age of Obama An Interview with Anne Hendershott
January 20 , 2009 12:00 pm EST
This week in America -- historic to be sure -- recalls , amidst so many other elements , the cultural phenomenon of marches .
“ If you march long enough , you 're bound to get somewhere , ” observed a reporter at the San Francisco Chronicle , referring to the countless civil rights marches that played an undeniable role in catalyzing the social change that this week culminates in the swearing in of the first African - American President of the United States .
Those marches have arguably reached their goal .
Other marches have not , and they will continue .
Washington will also be the backdrop this week for the annual March for Life .
Pro-life Americans also believe that if we march long enough , if we protest long enough , if we pray long enough , if we write , and preach and teach about the sanctity of human life from the very moment of conception long enough , we are bound to get somewhere .
A collection of original commentary from selected scholars and public policy experts , answering the question of whether the pro-life movement has “ failed . ”
In light of the large percentage of self - identified “ pro-life ” citizens who voted for Barak Obama – an ardent advocate of legal abortion – there is a widespread conversation about the pro-life movement ’s strategy , and many are publicly asking :
Has the broader pro-life movement “ failed ” ?
Does “ fail ” mean we did n’t overturn Roe v.
Wade , or does it mean more than that ?
Is it time for a new strategy in some sense ?
Is it a plausible argument that an Administration dedicated to unrestricted legal access to abortion might nonetheless promote a reduction in abortions through government social programs that encourage pre- and post-natal health care , parenting skills , income support and adoption ?
The Westchester Institute presents the following original commentaries from a select group of respected pro-life scholars and public policy experts who address such questions .
Has the Pro-Life Movement Failed ?
Ask an Abortion Doctor
By Cathy Ruse and Austin Ruse
Imagine yourself a typical abortion doctor , working anywhere in the country .
You ’re a late middle - aged man who never gets to know your patients and does n’t care to .
In the beginning you saw yourself as a hero in the fight for women ’s rights , but now years later as you travel a circuit of clinics , your unknown patients lying prone on table after table , the luster of your work has faded .
The Pro-Life Movement has Both Failed and Succeeded
By Helen Alvare
Catholics who voted for Obama ( a disproportionately non-Church - going , self - professed - Catholic group ) are very likely not thinking ( like most Americans ) about abortion at all .
It would be incorrect , therefore , to claim that the election of this man is an accurate evaluation of the status of the pro-life movement .
An accurate picture of the pro-life movement over the last 45 years , would rather have to acknowledge that the movement has both succeeded and failed .
Time to Redouble Our Efforts
By Maria McFadden Maffucci
I do not believe the pro-life movement has failed overall , in the sense that what we have been doing is wrong , or that what we have been aiming for is hopeless .
I believe that pro-life individuals have failed to make the protection of the unborn an actual priority .
The current election was not “ about ” abortion ; many who voted for Obama voted for him in spite of , not because of , his position on abortion .
A Temporary Defeat
By Anne Conlon
William Buckley liked to remind conservatives ( and liberals ) that there were no permanent victories , no permanent defeats .
Four years ago , after George Bush ’s reelection , the press saw mighty hordes of evangelicals everywhere on the political horizon ; the urgent question then was would the Democrats — and even the nation ’s two - party system — survive ?
On January 22 ( Roe v. Wade day ) , 2005 , Hillary Clinton startled many supporters when , in an address to New York ’s Family Planning Advocates , she declared that abortion was “ a sad , even tragic choice to many , many women , ” one that while “ guaranteed under our constitution , ” should “ not ever have to be exercised or only in very rare circumstances . ”
The following commentary , though not exclusive to the Westchester Institute , is highly relevant and especially poignant : written by our late friend Richard John Neuhaus , it was published in the January issue of First Things .
The Pro-Life Movement as the Politics of the 1960s
By Richard John Neuhaus
Copyright ( c ) 2009 First Things ( January 2009 )
Whatever else it is , the pro-life movement of the last thirty - plus years is one of the most massive and sustained expressions of citizen participation in the history of the United States .
Since the 1960s , citizen participation and the remoralizing of politics have been central goals of the left .
Is it not odd , then , that the pro-life movement is viewed as a right - wing cause ?
Reinhold Niebuhr wrote about “ the irony of American history ” and , were he around to update his book of that title , I expect he might recognize this as one of the major ironies within the irony .

Researchers Create Artificial Human Ovar
The potential benefits and the latent moral hazards
October 16 , 2010
A recent study published in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics described the scientific manufacture of an artificial human ovary which in turn produced a viable human egg .
Begun from real human ovarian tissue and grown on a prefab laboratory matrix , the artificial ovary was hailed as a major breakthrough .
As the authors observed , the experiment is proof of principle that an artificial ovary " can be created with self - assembled human theca and granulosa cell micro tissues , " and can produce viable human eggs for reproductive and other purposes .
The researchers went on to affirm that " theoretically , in vitro maturation of primordial [ eggs ] promises to yield the greatest number of fertilizable [ eggs ] for future reproduction . "
artificial
It should be noted that history has already seen one gravely disordered use of related biotechnology on the occasion of an American medical first : a pregnancy achieved through a sibling to siblingartificial ovarian transplant -- in this case , between identical twin sisters .
The moral disorder in this case should be apparent : ovaries , because of their intrinsic link to human life and specific human identity ( both of the woman and her eventual offspring ) are not on a par with other non-vital body parts which could be reasonably donated to a person in need .
Notwithstanding the genetic proximity of identical twins , the twin sister 's ovary is nonetheless bound up in her own identity ; her eggs are her eggs , with their unique genetic signature .
Consequently , procreation here occurs with the egg of another woman , thus involving a third party in the procreation process and rendering grave harm to the marital unity of the infertile sister and her husband .
By the same token , we have also witnessed anamazing , wonderful and morally licit use of related technology .
In 2005 , Stinne Holm Bergholdt had six strips of her own ovarian tissue returned to and transplanted onto her own ovaries .
She had the tissue frozen before starting chemotherapy treatments which can cause sometimes irreversible damage on human ovaries , rendering a woman infertile .
Since then , Stinne has had two children .
As with most biotech developments , the achievement of artificial human ovaries presents possible benefits , but also an alarming potential for scientific depravity .
On the positive side , the artificial ovary could assist the study of the early genesis of human eggs and offer a new research tool for the study of anomalies in the human reproductive process .
But beyond this potentially good application , the prospect of artificial ovaries constitutes a watershed opportunity for researchers to go mainstream with the dark project of human cloning .
Up until now , the lack of human eggs -- or oocytes -- has hampered attempts at successful human cloning .
At the present state of the art , approximately sixty to a hundred oocytes would be required to produce a single cloned human embryo .
Artificial ovaries could supply in spades the heretofore dearth of eggs available for research .
IVF clinics commonly discard many of the eggs retrieved for fertility treatments because they are too immature .
The new technology would allow for such eggs to be matured in vitro and consequently hugely increase the supply of available eggs .
As reported three years ago , some of the remaining hurdles to successful human cloning have already been surmounted .
Readers will recall the announcement , published in the journal Nature in November , 2007 , that Oregon - based scientist Shoukhrat Mitalipov successfully cloned monkey embryos and derived embryonic stem cells from them .
Mitalipov 's success with monkey embryo cloning provides the theoretical foundation for scientists to pursue so - called " therapeutic " cloning in humans .
Embryonic stem cells derived from a cloned human embryo , because they would be genetically identical to a patient , could be used in potential treatments without prompting an immune rejection response -- overcoming one of the greatest hurdles for researching and developing therapeutic applications for human embryonic stem cells .
In a recent poll published by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , 76 % of Americans express their opposition to human cloning for research purposes .
While reassuring , such a statistic hardly constitutes a solid assurance that Americans are truly poised to effectively prohibit dark projects , such as human cloning , that would render the use of mass quantities of human embryos for biomedical research common - place .
Such is the prospect we face .
It will take the sustained efforts of pro-life advocates at the grass roots level to translate adverse attitudes toward embryo - destructive research into an effective and national legislative prohibition of such research .
Westchester Institute White Papers
White Paper : Emergency Contraceptives & Catholic Healthcare
The question of the licitness of providing “ emergency contraceptives ” to victims of sexual assault who present in the emergency rooms at Catholic hospitals is a critical matter for evaluating and developing appropriate protocols for sexual assault victims .
An examination of the available scientific studies demonstrates that the most common emergency contraceptive — Plan B , generally administered to prevent ovulation — at times may fail to prevent conception from taking place and instead may prompt an early abortion .
This necessitates answering the question of when , and under what circumstances , it is morally licit to provide contraceptive medications to sexual assault victims while avoiding the potential outcome of prompting an early abortion .

White Paper : When Does Human Life Begin ?
Resolving the question of when human life begins is critical for advancing a reasoned public policy debate over abortion and human embryo research .
This article considers the current scientific evidence in human embryology and addresses two central questions concerning the beginning of life : 1 ) in the course of sperm -egg interaction , when is a new cell formed that is distinct from either sperm or egg ?
and 2 ) is this new cell a new human organism — i.e. , a new human being ?
Based on universally accepted scientific criteria , a new cell , the human zygote , comes into existence at the moment of sperm-egg fusion , an event that occurs in less than a second .
Upon formation , the zygote immediately initiates a complex sequence of events that establish the molecular conditions required for continued embryonic development .
The behavior of the zygote is radically unlike that of either sperm or egg separately and is characteristic of a human organism .
Thus , the scientific evidence supports the conclusion that a zygote is a human organism and that the life of a new human being commences at a scientifically well defined “ moment of conception . ”
This conclusion is objective , consistent with the factual evidence , and independent of any specific ethical , moral , political , or religious view of human life or of human embryos .

Knowing Right From Wrong
Benedict and a Leading Atheist Share Common Ground on Moral Theory
November 16 , 2010 9:00 am
American culture is happily awash of late with appeals to human reason .
Case in point is a new book by ultra anti-religionist Sam Harris .
Although the fundamental thesis of The Moral Landscape -- that “ science should one day be able to make very precise claims about which of our behaviors … are morally good ” -- is quite a stretch even by secular standards , Harris nonetheless does a couple of remarkable things for a leading public atheist .
First he insists that a knowledge of right and wrong should be a matter of objective , straightforward human knowledge , thus dismissing three centuries of philosophers who , in one form or another , have insisted that ‘ the good ’ does not name some objective quality at all , but only serves to euphemistically veil our own personal preferences : ‘ X is morally good ’ means nothing but ‘ I like X and I want you to like X too ’ .
More fascinating still is his insistence that both sides of the culture wars -- the Evangelical Christian right just as surely as the hard core champions of reductionist evolutionary psychology -- have erred in their notions of how we determine right from wrong , and this because they have failed to understand the full possibilities of human reason . “ [ A ] shared belief in the limitations of reason , ” affirms Harris , “ lies at the bottom of [ our ] cultural divides . ”
Both sides of the ‘ culture wars ’ , he insists , “ believe that reason is powerless to answer the most important questions in human life . ”
One cannot read this without the uncanny sense that Harris was somehow channeling another renowned critic of western thought , and one of Harris ’s own arch nemeses -- Benedict XVI .
Readers of this column will already be familiar with similar assessments of western thought penned by Benedict ( then Joseph Ratzinger ) in his seminal work Christianity and the Crisis of Cultures :
It is true that the positivist philosophies contain important elements of truth ; but these are based on a self - limitation of reason that is typical of one determined cultural situation , that of the modern West , and , as such , certainly cannot be considered the last word of reason …
This is why they are not the philosophy which one day could enjoy validity throughout the whole world .
With Harris , Benedict roundly rejects the misshapen conceptions about human reason on both sides of the culture wars .
Our highly technological and procedural western culture has found great use for reason in an era dominated by largely pragmatic concerns ; but it has found little use for reason on the big questions like the existence of God , and what ultimately constitutes right and wrong moral choices .
And this is as true of the staunchest secularists as of many of the most Bible - based Christian evangelicals : reason is of little help on these matters .
Now , when Harris speaks of ‘ human reason ’ , he means the drawing of conclusions from empirically based knowledge -- that and nothing more .
When Benedict , and more broadly the natural law tradition , speaks of ‘ human reason ’ , we mean , in addition to this , our ability to grasp innate truths about ourselves which are manifest to us independently of empirical evidence .
For example , I do not need to be taught , much less convinced by recent studies , that the trafficking of children to fuel the international porn industry constitutes a grave moral evil .
While Harris would undoubtedly concede trafficking of children is manifestly evil , he would hold , however , that such evidence is based on centuries of accrued human experience , not on the almost instantaneous insights of human reason .
True to form , Harris ’ disparagement of religion in The Moral Landscape is as boundless as his exaltation of the hard sciences .
Yet , Harris , Benedict and the tradition actually agree that ( a ) morality is ultimately rooted in an objective understanding of what fulfills us as human beings ; and that ( b ) an understanding of the behaviors that are corrosive to that fulfillment can be known objectively and transculturally .
That ’s not bad for two otherwise highly disparate thinkers .
It is a crying shame in fact that Harris is apparently so clueless about the Catholic natural law tradition .
If he would just for a moment set aside his over - the - top diatribes against formal religion , and read his Benedict more carefully , he might just find good reason to think perhaps we believers are not so wacked after all .
Illegal Immigration and Catholic Social Teaching
Some principles that should inform the debate
May 18 , 2010
Arizona governor Jan Brewer signed the Arizona Immigration Bill ( SB 1070 ) on April 23 .
The Catholic bishops of Arizona and an interfaith network of Arizona religious leaders responded with an emotionally charged statement accusing the governor of sacrificing “ political courage for political expediency ” and suggesting the law is an affront to human dignity and runs afoul of the basic moral precept directing us to welcome the stranger .
I must admit I have been taken aback at how many Catholic voices have been making fine arguments about a proper , genuinely Catholic attitude toward immigrants ( presumably those who enter the country legally ) , while entirely missing ( and arguing right past ) the issue at hand , namely , illegal immigration .
And I confess to have problems with all the invective coming from Catholic sources and directed at the Arizona law , particularly when it rests firmly on the principle of rule of law which is in turn itself derived from the natural moral law .
That this invective has been disproportionate ( to not say misguided ) becomes evident when we stop and consider what the Arizona law actually says : when law enforcement officers have a reasonable suspicion that a person is an alien unlawfully present in the U.S. , they may demand to see immigration papers on the spot , and may detain a suspected illegal alien who fails to present appropriate documentation .
National Review ’s Rich Lowry has explained how such “ reasonable suspicion ” might work in practice -- his point being that it is quite readily workable and has legal precedence and praxis .
So in looking at the text of the law on its merits , we must ask : is there anything unreasonable about it , much less draconian , fascist or grossly abrasive to human dignity ?
Arguably , according to a recent poll , 61 % of Americans do n’t think so .
How then does Catholic social teaching confront the question of immigration , broadly speaking , and illegal immigration more specifically ?
The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church structures a discussion of “ immigration ” by placing it in the section under the “ right to work , ” a fundamental human right affirmed by the Second Vatican Council in its Apostolic Constitution Gaudium et Spes .
It notes that “ in most cases … immigrants fill a labor need which would otherwise remain unfilled in sectors and territories where the local workforce is insufficient or unwilling to engage in the work in question . ”
It then calls for host countries to be vigilant to protect against the exploitation of laborers , to treat them with “ equity and balance , ” to strive to integrate them into society , to defend the right of immigrants to be reunited with their families , and to promote work opportunities for them .
To my knowledge , however , the Compendium does not suggest that the principle of rule of law should be subordinated somehow to the exigencies of the above mentioned rights .
SB 1070 does no injustice to an illegal immigrant forced to forfeit his presence in the U.S. even when that means a temporary separation from family members already here .
Such an eventuality is -- for any illegal alien -- a foreseeable potential consequence of breaking the law ; responsibility for the attendant hardships brought about by such a breakup rests squarely on the shoulders of the illegal alien , not on the community where he resides and into which he has patently failed to integrate through the observance of the law .
To be sure , ideal immigration laws will uphold the principle of rule of law while taking into account the impracticality and imprudence of simply deporting thousands of illegal aliens who have already integrated themselves into the U.S. work force .
On this score , SB 1070 is perhaps an imperfect law , but its measured application under the rubric of “ reasonable suspicion ” does not , in principle , harm the common good or constitute an affront to justice or personal dignity .
That said , it is by now obvious that SB 1070 is nothing less than an act of legislative exasperation in the face of federal policies which have failed miserably to protect state borders and impede the flow of drug traffic through the State .
We might hope that SB 1070 can serve in the long run to catalyze the push for effective and just national immigration policies -- policies that will deal effectively with our porous national borders ; get at the roots of drug and human trafficking ;
and lower barriers to immigration to those persons who honestly seek to work in the U.S. and integrate into American society abiding by the rule of law .
A Legal Bombshell Hits Stem Cell Science
NIH Funding of Embryo - destructive research blocked
Septenber 09 , 2010
On August 23 , Chief federal Judge Royce C. Lamberth of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the Obama administration 's guidelines for funding embryonic stem - cell research ( which went into effect on July 7 , 2009 ) violate federal law .
He then placed a temporary injunction on any further funding .
On Tuesday August 31 , the administration filed a motion to stay that decision while a case challenging the funding policy makes its way through the courts .
Lamberth took up the case after a court of appeals determined that plaintiffs James L. Sherley and Theresa Deisher , both adult stem - cell researchers , had standing to challenge the guidelines because these arguably discriminate against scientists seeking stem cell funding for projects that do not involve human embryonic stem cells .
In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal , Deisher explained that , " Any adult stem cell scientist is disadvantaged , and that 's because there is a deliberate focus to fund embryonic stem cell research and a focus away from adult stem cell research . "
And as Samuel Casey , counsel for the plaintiffs observed in a letter to the editors of the journal Nature , in so ruling :
The court faithfully applied a long line of cases , stretching back to the early 1970s .
These consistently held that participants in regulated markets suffer injury when illegal changes in the regulatory scheme alter the competitive landscape -- in this case , the increased competition for funding to support research on adult ( as opposed to embryonic ) stem cells .
At the heart of the matter in Lamberth ’s ruling is the Dickey - Wicker Amendment ( DWA ) which has been attached to the Health and Human Services appropriations bill every year since 1996 .
As written , it prohibits federal funding for “ the creation of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes ; or research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed , discarded , or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero under [ current federal law ] . ”
For 14 years , DWA has effectively prohibited the use of federal funds to support any research that would directly endanger or destroy human embryos .
Beginning in 1999 under the Clinton administration , however , DWA has been interpreted as restricting federal funding only for the research in which human embryos are actually created and destroyed .
Lamberth noted that the defendants in the case were insisting that DWA presupposes this same putative conceptual distinction between : ( a ) research directly on embryos , and ( b ) research on hESCs as if the two were wholly distinct research endeavors .
Resting their defense , as did the decades - old legal loophole on a much narrower interpretation of the phrase “ research in which , ” they argued that DWA prohibits funding of the former , but allows funding of the latter .
Lamberth for his part -- in a ruling that is breathtaking in its clarity , absent of any hint of judicial activism -- determined that , on an objective reading of the plain language of DWA , such a distinction is unsustainable :
[ T ]he language of the statute reflects the unambiguous intent of Congress to enact a broad prohibition of funding research in which a human embryo is destroyed .
This prohibition encompasses all “ research in which ” an embryo is destroyed , not just the “ piece of research ” in which the embryo is destroyed .
Had Congress intended to limit the Dickey - Wicker to only those discrete acts that result in the destruction of an embryo , like the derivation of ESCs , or to research on the embryo itself , Congress could have written the statute that way .
Congress , however , has not written the statute that way , and this Court is bound to apply the law as it is written .
And further :
If one step or “ piece of research ” of an ESC research project results in the destruction of an embryo , the entire project is precluded from receiving federal funding by the Dickey - Wicker Amendment .
It comes as no surprise that Reps. Dickey and Wicker , who crafted and sponsored the amendment in the first place , have insisted repeatedly over the years that their amendment was always meant to be read in just this fashion .
Until now that intent had been ignored by the NIH .
Those days , it seems , are over , at least until Congress takes steps to enact new legislative remedies to open the funding again -- a step they should consider with extreme caution since a majority of Americans ( 57 % according to a new poll ) oppose federal funding for hESC research .
For over a decade , DWA faithfully reflected a nation ’s conscience on this issue , a conviction now shared by most .
Let ’s see if Congress gets it .

It should come as no surprise that the Internet in Myanmar , the southeast Asian state once known as Burma and in the iron grip of a military cabal for decades , is heavily filtered and carefully monitored .
But a new report from the OpenNet Initiative , a human rights project linking researchers from the University of Toronto , Harvard Law School and Cambridge University in Britain , once again raises tough questions about the use of filtering technologies -- often developed by Western companies -- by autocratic governments bent on controlling what their citizens see on the Web .
Myanmar " employs one of the most restrictive regimes of Internet filtering worldwide that we have studied , " said Ronald J. Deibert , a principal investigator for the OpenNet Initiative and the director of the Citizen Lab at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto .
Myanmar now joins several nations , including China , Iran and Singapore , in relying on Western software and hardware to accomplish their goals , Mr. Deibert said .
