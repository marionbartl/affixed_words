Several years ago , I worked in a development department of a major publisher .
For its recent holiday season , it had , with a couple isolated exceptions , mostly released a cavalcade of licensed - IP , rushed and otherwise lackluster titles ( sound familiar ? ) .
At a subsequent all - hands meeting of the corporate headquarters , the president of the company took the stage and thanked us for our tireless efforts .
The company , he said , was doing better than ever before ; we had beat earnings expectations , shown positive revenue growth , and pleased Wall Street once again .
But not everything was rosy : we had proven time and again that we could make money , but our products were getting pummeled in the press – hurting the company ’s brand in the process .
This , he said , had to change .
The president outlined his vision : now that we had tackled the basic business of making and releasing games , our next big focus was to be quality .
It was n’t enough to just get the titles on store shelves and into people ’s homes .
We also had to ensure they were good games .
This meant taking a hard look at titles in development and deciding whether or not to continue with them .
It meant being careful when choosing partners with which to work .
And above all , it meant raising the reputation of the publisher ’s name , so that when people saw its logo on the box they knew they would n’t be getting something broken .
Being young , naïve , and with no sense of irony or sarcasm at the time ( perhaps I exaggerate ) , I bought into this speech .
I was impressed that he had candidly admitted that many of the games his company had shipped were pretty much terrible .
He mentioned the importance of making choices and doing things in which one could believe .
Finally , he ’d pointed out that making high - quality games was good business besides .
His words were resonating with me , and I walked out of the meeting hopeful that , if not immediately , in a few years I might be working at the kind of place that was n’t just an industry player by dint of size but also respect and perhaps one day even cultural cachet .
A while later , I was having lunch with an acquaintance who was a veteran of the company and the industry at large .
He had been with this particular publisher through its darkest and tiniest days , and had been in the game industry long enough to have worked on titles that were stored entirely in a couple meager kilobytes .
The subject of our conversation turned to my current and his former employer , and I told him about the speech , saying I felt the president really seemed to understand things .
He laughed in response and said , “ Matthew , they do this ‘ quality ’ thing every couple years .
It must have happened at least a half - dozen times while I was there .
Every time , they say they really need to improve quality and start these big initiatives centered around raising the caliber of their titles .
You ’ll see . ”
* * *
Quality is hard to measure and control even in cases where creative judgment and opinion do n’t enter the equation , such as in car manufacturing or construction .
But the subjective nature of entertainment , with all its opinions , whims , and fashions , complicates things even further .
As William Goldman wrote famously of the film business : nobody knows anything .
Just when someone thinks they ’ve figured out the secret formula to consistently create great entertainment , the ingredients suddenly collide in a way previously unforeseen .
Expectations are dashed , creators we believed in are found to be maddeningly inconsistent .
Maybe audiences have just gotten bored and are waiting for something fresh and unexpected to take the day .
The rules change all the time .
In order to try to raise the quality bar of its titles , the major publisher I worked for instituted , along with many of its peers in the industry , a system of bonuses for production employees based in part on average game review scores , as calculated by sites like GameRankings and Metacritic .
This incentive , in theory , pushed employees to achieve the greatness in our games that the president had identified as our goal .
But this meant equating a Metacritic score , which averages the numerical scores of dozens of reviews in diverse publications , to real intrinsic quality .
Armed with the knowledge that higher review scores meant more money for them , game producers were thus encouraged to identify the elements that reviewers seemed to most notice and most like – detailed graphics , scripted set piece battles , “ robust ” online multiplayer , “ player choice , ” and more , more of everything .
Like a food company performing a taste test to find out that people basically like the saltiest , greasiest variation of anything and adjusting its product lineup accordingly , the big publishers struggled to stuff as much of those key elements as possible into every game they funded .
Multiplayer modes were suddenly tacked on late in development .
More missions and weapons were added to bulk up their offering – to be created by outsource partners .
Level - based games suddenly turned into open - world games .
Before you cry in despair , keep in mind that all these people wanted in the end was the best game possible – or , more precisely , the best - reviewed game possible .
* * *
The president who made the big speech about quality left the company a few years later ( as did I ) .
His successor might have realized , or known all along , that low - quality movie - license games that happen to be on store shelves on the day of the movie release often make significantly more money than great games based on older properties , because that ’s what the company continued doing , to the benefit of its financial performance .
Abetted by well - executed sequels to its own properties , it remains to this day a great business success story .
Microsoft , for its part , recently announced that low scores from Metacritic will be part of the criteria used to remove titles from availability on its Xbox Live Arcade download service .
I can easily imagine the meeting that took place in Redmond as they rolled out a strategy to focus on quality .
Bush ' Torture ' Lawyers Duck Questions
Mixing haughty disdain with semantic quibbling , two key legal architects behind George W. Bush ’s “ war on terror ” tactics brushed aside congressional questions about how the administration fashioned its harsh interrogation policies that human rights experts say crossed the line into torture .

Printer friendly Former Justice Department lawyer John Yoo and Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff David Addington also downplayed their roles in formulating the theories of presidential power that gave Bush wide latitude to order that detainees be subjected to painful treatment to break them down .
Yoo , who is now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley , insisted that he only drafted the legal memos – from his post as a deputy in the Justice Department ’s powerful Office of Legal Counsel – and that other officials decided what interrogation techniques were permissible .
“ Decisions about interrogation methods at Guantanamo Bay were made by the Defense Department , ” said Yoo in Thursday ’s testimony before the House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution .
But Yoo appears to have been splitting hairs .
While it may be true that higher - ups in the Bush administration , including President Bush , had greater responsibility for approving the techniques , Yoo was not just the detached legal scholar that he portrayed at the hearing .
In his 2006 book , War by Other Means : An Insider ’s Account on the War On Terror , he described his participation in meetings that helped develop the controversial policies for the treatment of detainees .
For instance , Yoo wrote about a trip he took to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , with other senior administration officials to observe interrogations and to join in discussions about specific interrogation methods .
At Thursday ’s hearing , Addington , who was Vice President Cheney ’s legal counsel at the time of the administration ’s internal torture debate , also disputed some of the press reports that depicted him as the mastermind behind Bush ’s imperial presidency .
Cheney ’s Cheney Yet , while
Yoo relied on semantics and assertions of executive privilege to duck many congressional questions , Addington responded with bluster and contempt toward many of his Democratic inquisitors .
Addington , who is often called “ Cheney ’s Cheney ” for his bullying style , displayed his displeasure at being subpoenaed .
He submitted no prepared testimony and made no opening comment beyond correcting introductory comments by Rep. Jerrold Nadler , D - New York , the panel ’s chairman .
" Is that the entirety of your statement ? " Nadler asked .
" Yes , thank you , " Addington said .
" I 'm ready to answer your questions . "
But that was n’t entirely true , either .
Throughout the hearing , Addington did more fencing with the committee Democrats than sharing meaningful information about how the presidential policies on interrogations were devised .
Rep. John Conyers , D - Michigan , the courtly House Judiciary Committee chairman , asked about the “ unitary executive theory , ” a key tenet of right - wing legal reasoning for granting the President extraordinary powers .
Though Addington has long been a chief advocate of this concept , he quibbled over the words .
" I frankly do n't know what you mean by unitary theory , " Addington said .
" Have you ever heard of that theory before ? "
Conyers asked .
" I see it in the newspapers all the time , " Addington replied .
" Do you support it ? " " I do n't know what it is . "
In disbelief and with his voice rising , Conyers asked , " You 're telling me you do n't know what the unitary theory means ? "
" I do n't know what you mean by it , " Addington answered .
" Do you know what you mean by it ? "
" I know exactly what I mean by it , " Addington said , and then cited constitutional language that he said grants the President the “ unitary ” – or total – executive authority of the U.S. government .
‘ Irrelevant ’ Often as Democrats were asking questions , Addington would slouch in his chair , rub his beard or write notes to himself as if he was n’t paying attention .
When asked why the administration developed its own legal definition of torture rather than consult with members of Congress who had enacted anti-torture statutes , Addington called the idea “ irrelevant ” – much like his boss Cheney once reacted to a question about an opinion poll showing popular opposition to the Iraq War with a blunt , “ So ? ” At one point , Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , D - Florida , expressed disbelief about Addington ’s assertion that he could n’t remember discussions about methods of interrogation .
“ Is there a question pending , ma’am ? ” Addington responded petulantly .
Yoo presented a sharply different persona , offering a pained expression whenever he insisted that he wanted to cooperate but was constrained by the Justice Department ’s demand that he not divulge details about the formulation of the interrogation policies .
But Yoo also played word games with the Democrats , much as Addington did .
When Rep. Keith Ellison , D - Minnesota , asked a question about whether Yoo ’s memo on torture was “ implemented , ” Yoo retreated to a muddled academic discussion of what “ implemented ” meant .
" What do you mean by ' implemented ' ? "
Yoo asked .
An astonished Ellison responded , " Are you denying knowledge of what the word ' implement ' means ? "
" You 're asking me to define what you mean by the word ? "
" No , I 'm asking you to define what you mean by the word ' implement , ' " Ellison said , exasperation in his voice .
" It can mean a wide number of things , " Yoo observed .
[ For more on Yoo 's dissembling , see Consortiumnews.com 's " Defending the President as Tyrant " or Washington Post , June 27 , 2008 ]
Unprepared Democrats Based on the generalities of many questions directed at Yoo , it also appeared that Democratic committee members were unfamiliar with the contents of Yoo ’s book , in which he discusses in far greater detail how he formed legal opinions on torture , his reasons for recommending that the White House ignore the Geneva Conventions , and warrantless wiretaps .
Yoo was the author of an August 2002 legal opinion widely referred to as the
” torture memo ” that gave CIA interrogators legal cover to implement brutal methods during the interrogations of suspected terrorists .
He also drafted a second , similar opinion for military interrogators in March 2003 .
Yoo ’s book offers some clues behind the genesis of the August 2002 torture memo .
He wrote that in December 2001 “ senior lawyers from the Attorney General ’s office , the White House counsel ’s office , the Department ’s of State and Defense , and the [ National Security Council ] met to discuss the work on our opinion ” regarding whether the Geneva Convention applied to members of al - Qaeda and the Taliban .
Yoo wrote that he , too , participated in the meetings .
“ This group of lawyers would meet repeatedly over the next months to develop policy on the war on terrorism , ” Yoo wrote .
“ Meetings were usually chaired by [ White House counsel ] Alberto Gonzales ... his deputy , Timothy Flanigan , usually played the role of inquisitor , pressing different agencies to explain their legal reasoning to justify their policy recommendations . ”
Yoo wrote that the Defense Department was represented by its general counsel William “ Jim ” Haynes , the State Department by legal adviser William House Taft IV , and the NSC by John Bellinger , that agency ’s legal adviser .
The meetings that Yoo described appear similar to those disclosed by ABC News last April .
“ The most senior Bush administration officials repeatedly discussed and approved specific details of exactly how high - value al - Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the CIA , ” ABC News reported , citing unnamed sources .
“ The high - level discussions about these ‘ enhanced interrogation techniques ’ were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed – down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
“ These top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al - Qaeda suspects – whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding , sources told ABC News . ”
Resistance on Torture
Yoo wrote that the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) often clashed with the State Department over international laws banning torture .
“ In our arguments , State would authoritatively pronounce what the international law was , ” Yoo wrote .
“ OLC usually responded ‘ Why ?’— as in why do you believe that , why should we follow Europe ’s view of international law , why should we not fall back on our traditions and historical state practices ? ”
Yoo wrote that the policies he and other senior administration officials recommended , that al - Qaeda and the Taliban were not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Convention , also rankled military lawyers .
“ Judge Advocates General [ JAG ’s ] worried that if the United States did not follow the Geneva Conventions , our enemies might take it as justification to abuse American POW ’s in the future , ” Yoo wrote .
“ From what I saw the military had a fair opportunity to make it ’s views known .
Representatives from the Joint Chiefs of Staff , including uniformed lawyers , were present at important meetings on the Geneva question and fully aired their arguments . ”
The consensus among the officials who participated in the December 2001 meetings formed the basis of a legal memo sent to Gonzales that advised the White House that al - Qaeda and Taliban prisoners were not entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status or the Geneva Convention .
President Bush accepted that legal opinion verbally on Jan. 18 , 2002 .
“ The only way to prevent future September 11s will be by acquiring intelligence , ” Yoo wrote .
“ The main way of doing that is by interrogating captured al - Qaeda leaders or breaking into their communications ....
In an opinion eventually issued on Jan. 22 , 2002 , OLC concluded that al - Qaeda could not claim the benefits of the Geneva Conventions . ”
Yoo also wrote that in January 2002 he and the other administration officials who participated in the December 2001 meetings took a trip to Guantanamo Bay to observe the interrogations of several detainees
The trip took place seven months before he drafted the first of two legal opinions that were later withdrawn .
“ A gust of warm , humid air embraced us as we disembarked at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , ” Yoo wrote in his book .
“ I was the junior person on the flight among the senior lawyers there from the White House , Departments of Defense , State and Justice .
“ The group of us who landed that day had no idea that the ‘ front ’ in the war on terrorism would soon move from the battlefields of Afghanistan to the cells of Gitmo . ”
Geneva Protections
In the context of explaining why the prisoners were not entitled to the benefits of the Geneva Convention or prisoner of war status , Yoo wrote :
“ When our group of lawyers visited Gitmo , the Marine general in charge told us that several of the detainees had arrived screaming that they wanted to kill guards and other Americans . …
“ Many at Gitmo are not in a state of calm surrender .
Open barracks for most are utterly impossible ; some al - Qaeda detainees want to kill not only guards , but their peers who might be cooperating with the United States .
The provision of ordinary POW rights ... is infeasible . ”
Yoo ’s argument that only quiet POWs “ in a state of calm surrender ” should qualify for Geneva protections might be news to many former U.S. POWs , including Sen .
John McCain , who have boasted about their various forms of resistance to their captors .
Yoo added that a few weeks after he returned from Guantanamo “ the lawyers met again in the White House Situation Room to finally resolve the issue for presidential decision . ”
“ If Geneva Convention rules were applied , some believed they would interfere with our ability to apprehend or interrogate al - Qaeda leaders , ” Yoo wrote .
“ We would be able to ask Osama bin Laden loud questions and nothing more .
Geneva rules were designed for mass armies , not conspirators , terrorists or spies . ”
However , consensus eluded the group , according to Yoo .
“ Gonzales had the unenviable task of summarizing the different positions for President Bush and attempting to forge a consensus , ” Yoo wrote .
“ [ Gonzales recommended that the President find that neither al - Qaeda nor the Taliban were covered by Geneva . ”
However , Secretary of State Colin Powell urged President Bush to reconsider , according to Yoo .
On Feb. 7 , 2002 , President Bush sent a memo to Cheney , Powell , National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , Chief of Staff Andrew Card , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , CIA Director George Tenet , Attorney General John Ashcroft , General Richard Myers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , which said , “ the Geneva Conventions only applied to conflicts involving states fighting with regular armed forces , ” according to Yoo ’s book .
Yoo wrote that Bush believed that “ the war on terrorism ushered in a new paradigm , one in which groups with broad , international reach commit horrific crimes against innocent civilians , sometimes with the direct support of states .
[ Bush ] accepted that he could suspend the Conventions with regard to Afghanistan , but decided not to .
“ Instead , he found that the Taliban were ‘ unlawful combatants ’ [ and ] also found that Common Article 3 applied only to an ‘ armed conflict not of an international character , ’ and hence neither to the war with al - Qaeda nor the Taliban . ”
However , little of this history found its way into the congressional hearings .
Between the bluster and the legalisms , Addington and Yoo managed to fend off most of the questioning .

Feds :
Teen use of pot can lead to mental illness via The Associated Press
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Depression , teens and marijuana are a dangerous mix that can lead to dependency , mental illness or suicidal thoughts , according to a White House report released Friday .
A teen who has been depressed at some point in the past year is more than twice as likely to have used marijuana as teens who have not reported being depressed — 25 percent compared with 12 percent , said the report by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy .
“ Marijuana is a more consequential substance of abuse than our culture has treated it in the last 20 years , ” said John Walters , director of the office .
“ This is not just youthful experimentation that they ’ll get over as we used to think in the past . ”
“ It ’s not something you look the other way about when your teen starts appearing careless about their grooming , withdrawing from the family , losing interest in daily activities , ” Walters said .
“ Find out what ’s wrong . ”
Gotta love Walters ’ remark about hygiene — which he appears to have taken almost verbatim from Above The Influence ’s hateful propaganda film , Stoners In The Mist .
Seriously though , it goes without saying that this so - called White House " report " ( I use the term euphemistically here , given that said " report " is under five pages and consists mostly of bar charts rather than text ) is much ado about nothing .
In fact , the only newsworthy aspect of this supposed " study " is that the lapdog mainstream media gave it any coverage at all .
In short , there ’s nothing to the Drug Czar ’s marijuana and mental health claims that NORML Advisory Board member Dr. Mitch Earleywine and I have n’t previously addressed in our essay here :
Pot Smoking Wo n’t Make You Crazy , But Dealing With The Lies About It Will via Alternet
Perhaps the most impressive evidence against the cause - and - effect relationship concerns the unvarying rate of psychoses across different eras and different countries .
People are no more likely to be psychotic in Canada or the United States ( two nations where large percentages of citizens use cannabis ) than they are in Sweden or Japan ( where self - reported marijuana use is extremely low ) .
Even after the enormous popularity of cannabis in the 1960s and 1970s , rates of psychotic disorders have n’t increased .
Ironically , just two days prior to the Drug Czar ’s much ballyhooed press conference , Britain ’s Advisory Panel on the Misuse of Drugs refuted the notion that pot use causes mental illness , stating , “ The evidence for the existence of an association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis is , on the available evidence , weak . ”
A 2006 review by the same commission previously concluded , “ The current evidence suggests , at worst , that using cannabis increases lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia by one percent . ”
And more recently , a highly touted meta-analysis in the British medical journal , The Lancet , reported that there is a dearth of scientific evidence indicating that cannabis use causes psychotic behavior , noting , “ Projected trends for schizophrenia incidence have not paralleled trends in cannabis use over time . ”
Of course , none of this dismisses the possibility that pot use may exacerbate certain mental health problems in a handful of individuals .
As NORML notes in a recent white paper , “ Cannabis , Mental Health and Context : ”
There is limited data suggesting an association , albeit a minor one , between chronic cannabis ( primarily among adolescents and / or those predisposed to mental illness ) and increased symptoms of depression , psychotic symptoms , and / or schizophrenia .
However , interpretation of this data is troublesome and , to date , this observation association is not well understood .
Identified as well as unidentified confounding factors ( such as poverty , family history , polydrug use , etc. ) make it difficult , if not impossible , for researchers to adequately determine whether any cause - and - effect relationship exists between cannabis use and mental illness .
Also , many experts point out that this association may be due to patients ’ self - medicating with cannabis , as survey data and anecdotal reports of individuals finding therapeutic relief from both clinical depression and schizotypal behavior are common within medical lore , and clinical testing on the use of cannabinoids to treat certain symptoms of mental illness has been recommended .
That said , however , the most practical public policy to address these concerns is not criminal prohibition , but regulation .
If there does exist a minority population of citizens who may be genetically prone to potential harms from cannabis ( such as , possibly , those predisposed to schizophrenia ) , then a regulated system would best identify and educate this sub-population to pot ’s potential risks so that they may refrain from its use , if they so choose .
To draw a real world comparison , millions of Americans safely use ibuprofen as an effective pain reliever .
However , among a minority of the population who suffer from liver and kidney problems , ibuprofen presents a legitimate and substantial health risk .
However , this fact no more calls for the criminalization of ibuprofen among adults than do these latest allegations , even if true , call for the current prohibition of cannabis .

The Best of Paul Armentano
One gets the impression that there are some people in Washington who believe that Israel or the U.S. can bomb Iran ’s nuclear reactors , fly home , and it will be mission complete .
It makes you wonder if perhaps there is a virus going around that is gradually making people stupid .
If we or Israel attack Iran , we will have a new war on our hands .
The Iranians are not going to shrug off an attack and say , " You naughty boys , you . "
Consider how much trouble Iraq has given us .
Some 4,000 dead and 29,000 wounded , a half a trillion dollars in cost and still climbing , and five years later , we cannot say that the country is pacified .
Iraq is a small country compared with Iran .
Iran has about 70 million people .
Its western mountains border the Persian Gulf .
In other words , its missiles and guns look down on the U.S. ships below it .
And it has lots of missiles , from short - range to intermediate - range ( around 2,200 kilometers ) .
More to the point , it has been equipped by Russia with the fastest anti-ship missile on the planet .
The SS - N - 22 Sunburn can travel at Mach 3 at high altitude and at Mach 2.2 at low altitude .
That is faster than anything in our arsenal .
Iran ’s conventional forces include an army of 540,000 men and 300,000 reserves , including 120,000 Iranian Guards especially trained in unconventional warfare .
It has more than 1,600 main battle tanks and 21,000 other armored combat vehicles .
It has 3,200 artillery pieces , three submarines , 59 surface warships and 10 amphibious ships .
It ’s been receiving help in arming itself from China , North Korea and Russia .
Unlike Iraq , Iran ’s forces have not been worn down with bombing , wars and sanctions .
It also has a new anti-aircraft defense system from Russia that I ’ve heard is pretty snazzy .
So , if you think we or Israel can attack Iran and not expect retaliation , I ’d have to say with regret that you are a moron .
If you think we could easily handle Iran in an all - out war , I ’d have to promote you to idiot .
Attacking Iran would be folly , but we seem to be living in the Age of Folly .
Morons and idiots took us into an unjustified war against Iraq before we had finished the job in Afghanistan .
Now we have troops tied down in both countries .
For some years now , I ’ve worried that we seem to be more and more like Colonial England  arrogant , racist , overestimating our own capacity and underestimating that of our enemies .
As the fate of the British Empire demonstrates , that is a fatal flaw .
The British never dreamed that the " little yellow people " could come ashore by land and take Singapore from the rear or that they would sink the pride of the British fleet , but they did both .
I suppose no one in Washington can imagine the Iranians sinking one of our carriers in the Persian Gulf .
How ’d you like to be the president who has to tell the American people that we ’ve lost a carrier for the first time since World War II ?
Exactly how the Iranians will respond to an attack , I do n’t know , but they will respond .
In keeping with our present policy , our attack on Iran would be illegal , since under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , Iran has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes .
Who would have thought that we would become the rogue nation committing acts of aggression around the globe ?

Dems tell Justice Dept. to examine Bush admin about torture Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday June 7 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Nearly 60 House Democrats want a special counsel created within the Justice Department to determine whether top Bush administration officials have committed crimes in authorizing the use of harsh interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists , Joby Warrick reported for the Washington Post Saturday .
In a letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , the lawmakers cited what they said was " mounting evidence " that senior officials personally sanctioned the use of waterboarding and other aggressive tactics against detainees in U.S. - run prisons overseas , according to the article .
" This [ new ] information indicates that the Bush administration may have systematically implemented , from the top down , detainee interrogation policies that constitute torture or otherwise violate the law , " it said .
The letter was signed by 59 House Democrats , including House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers .
The Bush administration first admitted to the authorization of waterboarding in February and later defended it as a legal interrogation method that has saved American lives , the Associated Press reported .
A spokesman said President Bush could authorize waterboarding for future terrorism suspects if certain criteria are met , according to the article .
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , one of the Sept. 11 attackers whose arraignment began Thursday , was one of three Guantanamo detainees subjected to waterboarding , The New York Times reported .
Mr. Bushs administration appears to have calculated that many Americans , if not most , do not necessarily object to harsh interrogations or eavesdropping if they were used to prevent further attacks , The New York Times reported in an analysis of the detainees ' trial .
At a fund - raiser on Friday in Pennsylvania , Vice President Dick Cheney , pictured above , vigorously defended the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques , referring to them as a tougher program for a very few tougher customers .
 He and others were questioned at a time when another attack on this country was believed to be imminent ,  Mr. Cheney said of Mr. Mohammed and other Qaeda members .
 It s a good thing we had them in custody , and it is a good thing that we found out what they knew . 
One thing the Internet has taught us : if you want to see a defamatory / embarrassing / ridiculous claim about yourself or your business cleaned from the tubes , the one thing you do n't want to do is file an ill - advised lawsuit against a site like Wikipedia .
What once was known only by a few is suddenly known by the world .
Barbara Bauer , who runs the Barbara Bauer Literary Agency , looks like she 's set to learn that lesson the hard way after suing Wikipedia for an article that called her the " Dumbest of the Twenty Worst " literary agents and said that she had made no book sales at all .
The controversy stems from a few brief statements regarding Bauer 's track record ( none of which remain on the site at this time ) .
These statements were n't simply dragged from the ether ; Bauer was included on a list of the twenty worst agents back in 2006 and that list was widely circulated in the blogosphere .
The controversy was discussed at the time by writer Teresa Nielsen Hayden , who called Bauer a " well - known scam agent " and the " dumbest of the twenty worst . "
Even before that , writers were complaining about her agency in various discussion forums .
Bauer 's alleged faults are the usual ones that you hear about in the unregulated world of literary agents .
For instance , Victoria Strauss of Writer Beware noted that she had " been tracking Barbara Bauer since 1997 .
We have ample documentation , supported by reports and complaints from writers , that she charges a ' processing fee ' ( currently $ 55 ) , a ' marketing ' fee ( currently $ 650 ) , and over the years has charged other kinds of fees , such as a one - time ' retainer ' of $ 1,000 .
I 've heard from writers who received profane and abusive responses when they questioned the fees or other aspects of her business , and I 've also heard from former clients who say she contacted them only when it was time to send in an annual check . "
Most reputable agents are members of the Association of Authors ' Representatives , which has a policy against reading fees .
Bauer is not a member , according to its database .
When Wikipedia refused to remove the offending comments , Bauer sued the site in a New Jersey court .
Lawyers representing Wikipedia have now responded ( PDF ) , arguing that the claims should be tossed because Wikipedia is protected by federal law from comments made by its users .
That law , of course , is the Communications Decency Act , which generally holds service providers and forum operators harmless from content posted by their users ( this principle is what protects Ars from liability regarding the crazier goings - on in our own forums ) .
Aggrieved parties can still file suit , but they have to go after the poster , not the company that provides the place to post .
The Wikipedia lawyers argue that the law is so clear on these matters that Bauer 's " frivolous " lawsuit against the site should be dismissed immediately ... after which it will no doubt be written up on Wikipedia .
A new edge to Clinton 's stump
Ken Vogel reports from McAllen Texas that Clinton has reworked her stump speech to sharpen her attacks on Obama .
“ There is a big difference , " she said .
“ I am in the solutions business , my opponent is in the promises business . ”
“ We need real results , not more rhetoric .
We need to get back in the solutions business .
That ’s why I have a plan that will cover every American with health insurance , stop these foreclosures and put people back to work , ” she said , adding that she and edwards agreed on need for moratorium on foreclosures , while Obama does n't .
" It ’s not the questions , it ’s the answers , and the answers get right to the heart of who is ready on day one to be the president and commander in chief of the United States . "
“ I have solutions to these economic challenges .
The question today is does Sen. Obama ?
Because a plan that fails to provide universal healthcare , fails to address the housing crisis and fails to immediately start creating good paying jobs in America again , will not turn the economy around and provide the real relief that our people need , " she said .
She only made one allusion to the lengthening odds she faces :
“ Two of my personal heroines came out of Texas .
You remember Congresswoman Barbara Jordan , Gov Ann Richards .
They taught me about courage and determination .
I can hear their voices saying : ‘ You keep going , you give the people a real choice . ' ”
( Fortune ) --
Until the recent tempest , Wall Street firms looked like just about the world 's best businesses .
Year after year , they posted sumptuous returns on equity , ever - rising share prices , and if you believed their claims , a new breed of CEOs who 'd mastered the art and science of risk management .
True , it was hard to decipher exactly how they made all that money .
But make it they did .
The standards that rule most businesses�� - avoiding excessive leverage , reining in rampant pay and the massive dilution that goes with it�� - did n't apply to Wall Street .
So what if investors did n't understand all those arcane instruments and sophisticated hedging strategies ?
Wall Street was the black box on the Hudson that worked its own brand of magic .
Today , the magic is fading fast .
It 's time to step back and analyze how financial firms actually operate .
The truth is that they 've been relying on a highly - flawed business model for years .
Put simply , Wall Street firms used towering leverage to make tons of money in a long - running bull market that blatantly underpriced risk .
At the same time , they handed a huge chunk of the gains to employees in the form of excessive pay .
Now that run is over , and the price of risk is rising dramatically .
That 's driving down value of everything from junk bonds to mortgaged backed securities .
Wall Street 's addiction to leverage is cutting the wrong way .
The Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) meltdown is a primer in the Wall Street curse :
When portfolios are built on a mountain of debt , a firm 's entire equity base can vanish overnight .
The same curse is now taking its toll at Lehman ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) , and Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) .
So let 's look at where Wall Street went wrong , and what it can do to redeem itself .
Be warned .
Redemption wo n't be easy .
The three big weaknesses of Wall Street are deeply embedded in its culture .
First , firms rely far too heavily on trading as opposed to solid , reliable fee - based businesses favored by big commercial banks .
As we 'll see , one type of Wall Street trading is consistently lucrative .
The rub is that firms always blow it on the risky trading .
Second , firms embrace leverage levels so dangerous that even the best risk management can't prevent a collapse .
Third , an outsize share of the gains go out the door to CEOs , CFOs and traders when times are good�� - or rather , when firms get lucky - ��leaving shareholders with far less wealth when markets go sour .
The first issue�� - trading�� - is complex .
That 's because a large part of Wall Street trading is a super money - maker , even if the way it 's conducted is a drag for the average investor .
A decade ago , Wall Street garnered most of its revenues from fee - based businesses , including M&A advisory , brokerage , equity and debt underwriting , and asset management .
Today , over 60 % of revenues flow from trading .
It 's important to realize that trading falls into two distinct categories , call them part A and part B. Wall Street firms occupy a highly privileged position for viewing which investors are buying which stocks and bonds .
That 's because their primary clients , often through their prime brokerage businesses , are the world 's biggest investors , mutual funds .
Anyone who 's worked as a Wall Street trader will tell you that the firms use their market intelligence to trade for their own accounts .
Though the fund clients complain about the practice , they put up with it .
So Wall Street firms enjoy an edge over the rest of us , and use it aggressively .
This part of trading is incredibly , even consistently , lucrative .
If Wall Street stopped there , it would n't be facing its current crisis .
The problem comes with Part B , trading that 's potentially dangerous .
Wall Street firms can't resist taking big positions in currencies , mortgage backed securities , oil futures , junk bonds or other speculative vehicles , especially when they 're hot .
It happened in the late 1990s with the Asian Contagion , the LTCM meltdown , and the Russian debt crisis , and again with the tech bubble .
When risk premiums on those assets keep falling , as they did consistently from 2002 until the middle of last year , the Wall Street mavens look like geniuses .
But when the risk spreads expand suddenly and dramatically , the story of the last 9 months , the prices of those assets drop sharply .
Wall Street leaders from Stan O'Neal , former Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) CEO , to John Mack , chief of Morgan Stanley , boasted that their firms ' skills in risk management would prevent massive losses from proprietary trading , part B , as we call it .
But the enormous profits on the way up was a danger signal that Wall Street was playing on the edge .
The losses on the way down are proof that either Wall Street is n't as good at hedging as it claims , or more likely , that too much hedging would spoil the huge profits it craves when markets are roaring .
Wall Street 's second problem is its love of leverage .
At the end of 2007 , Morgan Stanley and Lehman had ratios of assets to shareholders ' equity of 33 to 1 , closely rivaled by 28 to 1 at Merrill .
Again , it 's the curse that felled Bear Stearns :
If the value of the portfolios of any of these firms falls by 3 % , their entire capital would be wiped out .
To be sure , that massive leverage magnified gains mightily from 2002 to mid-2007 .
But today , it threatens to erase most , or even all , of their shareholders ' wealth .
The sad truth is that Wall Street managers are n't geniuses but big risk - takers who get lucky .
Until they get unlucky .
It 's the third problem , Wall Street 's legendary largesse on pay , that encourages that outrageous risk - taking .
The system rewards swashbuckling behavior from every level from traders to CEOs .
If traders can generate big profits for a year or two by taking risky bets , they can collect bonuses big enough to retire on .
In good years , top managers at places like Bear and Morgan Stanley collect grants of restricted stock and options far out of proportion to the size of their companies .
For example , James Cayne , Bear 's former CEO , collected almost $ 40 million in pay for 2006 .
Once again , Bear 's big profits were driven largely by excessive leverage and a frothy market , not , to put it mildly , by enlightened management .
At most of the firms , the employees took 30 % or more of the company through stock grants that they paid nothing for , leaving far less for shareholders .
So what 's the solution ?
First , Wall Street must return to its roots in fee - based businesses .
It would also do far better relying on part A type trading , though the ethics of that business are questionable , and it may fade as trading becomes more automated and electronic systems that allow clients to remain anonymous inevitably flourish .
Second , the current leverage ratios are irresponsible , and must come down .
Indeed , Jamie Dimon forged his reputation as one of Wall Street 's most prudent managers at Travelers by demanding that the investment bank limit its leverage .
Third , the compensation system must be revamped so that traders and managers bank their bonuses forward , so that they 're only released if the firms are profitable over a sustained period of say , four or five years , not a single year .
That reform is probably just a dream , given what stars expect on Wall Street .
But it would favor shareholders over employees , a dream that 's worth achieving .
The most probable result of all this turmoil is n't the reforms I 've mentioned , at least not directly .
It 's that the already shrinking ranks of independent firms get swallowed up by big banks , either domestic or foreign .
That 's the system in Europe and Asia .
It was only the artificial separation of investment and commercial banks that kept the Wall Street firms independent for this long .
But Wall Street has blown it .
Over time , big banks , boasting far more capital and far more discipline , will tame Wall Street .
It just happened with JP Morgan ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Bear .
And that 's just the beginning .

A BARBARIC METHOD OF CIRCUMCISION AMONGST SOME OF THE ARAB TRIBES OF YEMEN .
By Dr. Y.V. CHABUKSWAR , Senior Grade Second Class Sub -Assist .
Surgeon , in sub-charge , Civil Hospital , Aden .
It is enjoined in the Koran by the Prophet that an infant should be circumcised on the seventh day after its birth [ this is erroneous : the Qu'ran does not mention circumcision ] , but this is not observed in many places , even in Arabia .
The common practice amongst all Mahomedans and Jews , as is well known , is to remove the redundant portion of the prepuce only .
There is a district in Yemen called Al Hoora , about 15 days journey from Aden .
In this province of Al Hoora there are six villages , viz. , Hijaji , Mugrasi , Udebli , Ukabi , Wahagari and Mugawiya , governed by an Arab ruler , by name Ali Murgayeh .
The circumcision is performed , not in infancy or childhood , as is usually done , but amongst the grown - ups , who are about to marry .
Unless the man is circumcised in this particular manner , he cannot obtain a bride .
The circumcision is done with religious ceremonies as follows :--
The man who is to undergo the circumcision sends invitation to all his relativesand friends in his town and in the surrounding villages named above ; a day is fixed and the would - be bridegroom is taken up to a high building , open to view on all sides and specially erected for this purpose .
He is well dressed like a bride - groom , the guests , males and females , together with other spectators watching him from below ; the victim is made to stand with his right arm lifted up , holding a dagger and looking straight forward with steady eyes .
One Arab is appointed to watch the movements of his face and eyelids , and the operator , called Rayis ( barber ) or Khadim , commences the operation of circumcision at about one inch below the umbilicus , dissecting the skin downwards , peeling off the entire skin of the penis , leaving that of the scrotum intact , without any local or general anaesthetic .
If , during this operation , the man undergoing the circumcision even winks a little , or shows any sign of pain of the operation , it is at once abandoned , and one of the following punishments is given to the victim :-- ( a ) Killed on the spot ; ( b ) deported from the district in disgrace ; or ( c ) sold as a slave to outsiders .
Of course , the bride , for the sake of whom he was undergoing circumcision , is totally lost to him .
Very often the would - be bride is also one of the spectators .
If the operation is successfully finished , and the man goes through the ordeal with courage and without showing signs of pain or cowardice , the occasion is celebrated with great rejoicings and feasting , with beating of drums and firing of arms .
The man is congratulated by all who are gathered , and the Rayis finishes off his work by imparting a kiss on his forehead .
The man is taken to his house and receives presents of ghee , cloth , goats , etc .
The wound takes about two to eight months to heal , or even longer , and suppuration always takes place .
The dressings used by the patient are simple : a daily wash in the morning and applying to the wound leaves of a shrub , called by the Arabs " Sulla " , smeared with a little oil .
The operator`s fee in the case is only one Riyal – a silver coin worth Rs. 2 - 4 , and the Hakim`s , i.e. , the Rulers` fee is also the same as that of the Rayis .
The very commonly expected bad results of the circumcision are hernia and urethral fistula – the latter is one in every ten such operations .
The deaths from sepsis are also very common .
As will be seen from the accompanying photos , the whole of the skin from a point just below the umbilicus to the root of the penis , with all the hair - bearing area , and all the skin of the penis , as far as the scrotum , is removed .
In some cases , as in photo No.2 , a portion of the penile urethra is also removed , of course unintentionally .
Several such cases of loss of a portion of the urethra , in one case fully one inch , have been treated at this hospital .
Case No.1 , photo No.1 , --
An Arab , aged 25 , resident of Mugawiya , the slave of case No.2 , was circumcised 12 years ago .
The wound took about seven months to heal , resulting in left inguinal hernia , with extensive scarring .
This man was operated on by Major M.S.Irani , I.M.S. , the Acting Civil Surgeon , Aden , on 8th November , 1920 , and was discharged cured on 25th November , 1920 .
Case No.2 , photo No.2 , --
An Arab , aged 40 , resident of Mugawiya , was circumcised 12 years ago .
The wound took about two months to heal , resulting in urethral fistula two months after the operation , the fistula being situated at the root of the penis .
This man was operated on 17th November , 1920 , by Major M.S.Irani , I.M.S. , The Acting Civil Surgeon , Aden , who secured a flap from the skin of the scrotum to form the floor of the urethra , taking over flaps from either side of the scrotum to cover up this inverted flap .
The wound exhibited healthy signs of healing , but the man , being very anxious to see his native land , and , probably , his bride , left this hospital of his own accord , on 25th November , 1920 , equipped with simple surgical dressings .
I submit the above notes , with a hope that these will be of some interest to the profession , because it is not likely that such cases will be seen in other Mahomedan countries .
The above notes are published with the kind permission of the operator , to whom I am very much thankful .

The Way of the Master is a young - earth - creationist fundamentalist Christian organization that promotes the notion that we are all cursed since creation and doomed to burn in eternal hellfire unless we bow down before Jesus .
Where other Christian sects preach love and benevolence , WOTM propagates fearmongering , suggesting people should be " terrified " of the consequences of not accepting Jesus as savior .
WOTM engages in various techniques designed to convince people that everyday acts such as looking at another person with lust , is analogous to adultery .
Part 1 : Lust = Adultery
Summary :
Not content with merely scaring people with hellfire by committing adultery , the WotM crew interpret scripture to suggest that even looking at a woman with lust in your eyes is , according to the Bible , adultery .
Critique :
In the first one - to - one segment , Ray tries the classic Argument From Design on an atheist on the street , having him point to a building and having him admit he knows that building was created , but the atheist says he knows who built that building - he does n't know or see God .
With footage like this that WotM left in , you have to imagine what was on the cutting room floor .
Part 2 : Lust = Adultery ( cont . )
Summary : WotM continues with cleverly worded hell scare tactics , saying lust is adultery .
Ray advocates gouging your eye out as a safer alternative to holding onto the metaphorical stick of dynamite that is lust .
The theory is that it 's better to enter heaven with one eye than hell with two .
Critique :
The entire premise of this segment seems to be based around the idea that lust is adultery , and the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus / God .
Sounds like more hellfire scare tactics to me .
Pascal 's Wager anyone ?
Part 3 :
Summary : God 's law is absolute and uncompromising , he does n't bend it for anyone .
Coins the oxymoron ' a healthy fear for god ' .
Interviews 3 guys on the street and administers a 10 commandments test , concluding that they are all ' lying thieving blasphemous adulterers ' and will burn in hell .
Critique : Displays lack of understanding by asking the rhetorical question ' What if I go on the freeway and do n't believe in trucks ?
Does that make them any less dangerous ? ' to which the interviewee responds ' But trucks are real , there is actual evidence for their existence ' or something to that effect .
Ray resorts to fear mongering again , and advocates that they gouge their eyes out .

Rambo takes his hot tub and walks to Chicago .
Ever since there have been scientists , there have been those who are wildly successful , publishing one well - received paper after another , and those who are not .
And since nearly the same time , there have been scholars arguing over what makes the difference .
What is it that turns one scientist into more of a Darwin and another into more of a dud ?
After years of argument over the roles of factors like genius , sex and dumb luck , a new study shows that something entirely unexpected and considerably sudsier may be at play in determining the success or failure of scientists  beer .
According to the study , published in February in Oikos , a highly respected scientific journal , the more beer a scientist drinks , the less likely the scientist is to publish a paper or to have a paper cited by another researcher , a measure of a paper ’s quality and importance .
The results were not , however , a matter of a few scientists having had too many brews to be able to stumble back to the lab .
Publication did not simply drop off among the heaviest drinkers .
Instead , scientific performance steadily declined with increasing beer consumption across the board , from scientists who primly sip at two or three beers over a year to the sort who average knocking back more than two a day .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain officially kicked off his general election campaign today , promising to bring his race for the White House to “ all 13 colonies . ”
At a campaign stop in the Dominion of Virginia , Sen. McCain said that if his Democratic opponent , Sen. Barack Obama , takes any of the 13 colonies for granted , “ he doth so at his peril . ”
Sen .
McCain made his remarks in the Dominion of Virginia , which many McCain advisers concede will be a key colony in the fall election .
But in announcing his 13 - colony strategy , Sen. McCain appeared to give notice that he intends to contest such traditional Democratic strongholds as the Province of Massachusetts Bay .
The Republican nominee gave his audience a sneak preview of the fall campaign by introducing what he clearly believes to be the dominant issue of the 2008 election : the high cost of tea .
“ The American people cannot and should not tolerate the exorbitant prices they are paying for tea , ” Sen .
McCain said , adding that in some states tea had risen to as high as four dollars a gallon .
He said that as president he would propose a number of measures to provide relief to tea consumers , including a “ tea - tax holiday , ” and that he would crack down on the big tea companies : “ It ’s time for their tea party to end . ”
In the conclusion of his remarks , Sen. McCain vowed that his campaign would employ “ the latest technology ” to spread his message across the 13 colonies .
“ We will use the telegraph key , the carrier pigeon , and the pony , ” he said .
Morton 's Demon Post of the Month : February 2002 by Glenn Morton
Newsgroups : talk.origins Date : February 2 , 2002 Message -ID : a3g5n4$3do$1@knossos.btinternet.com
Maxwell suggested a famous demon which could violate the laws of thermodynamics .
The demon , sitting between two rooms , controls a gate between the two rooms .
When the demon sees a speedy molecule coming his way ( from room A ) , he opens the gate and lets the speedy molecule leave the room and when he sees a slow molecule coming at the gate ( from room A ) , he holds it closed .
Oppositely , when he sees a speedy molecule coming at the gate from room B he closes the gate but when he sees a slow molecule from room B coming toward the gate he opens it .
In this way , the demon segregates the fast moving molecules into one room from the slow ones in the other .
Since temperature of a gas is related to the velocity of the molecules , the demon would increase the temperature of room B and cool room A without any expenditure of energy .
And since a temperature difference can be used to create useful work , the demon would create a perpetual motion machine .
Maxwell 's demon was shown to fail by Szilard who showed that the demon needed to use light ( and expend energy ) to determine a fast molecule from a slow one .
This energy spent to collect information meant that the demon could n't violate the 2nd law .
The reason I mention this is because I realized tonight that the YECs have a demon of their own .
In a conversation with a YEC , I mentioned certain problems which he needed to address .
Instead of addressing them , he claimed that he did n't have time to do the research .
With other YECs , I have found that this is not the case ( like with sds@mp3.com who refused my offer to discuss the existence of the geologic column by stating " It 's on my short list of topics to pursue here .
It 's not up next , but perhaps before too long . "
Message - ID : a3bv4t$v2m$1@slb1.atl.mindspring.net )
And with other YECs , they claim lack of expertise to evaluate the argument and thus wo n't make a judgment about the validity of the criticism .
Still other YECs refuse to read things that might disagree with them .
Thus was born the realization that there is a dangerous demon on the loose .
When I was a YEC , I had a demon that did similar things for me that Maxwell 's demon did for thermodynamics .
Morton 's demon was a demon who sat at the gate of my sensory input apparatus and if and when he saw supportive evidence coming in , he opened the gate .
But if he saw contradictory data coming in , he closed the gate .
In this way , the demon allowed me to believe that I was right and to avoid any nasty contradictory data .
Fortunately , I eventually realized that the demon was there and began to open the gate when he was n't looking .
However , my conversations have made me aware that each YEC is a victim of my demon .
Morton 's demon makes it possible for a person to have his own set of private facts which others are not privy to , allowing the YEC to construct a theory which is perfectly supported by the facts which the demon lets through the gate .
And since these are the only facts known to the victim , he feels in his heart that he has explained everything .
Indeed , the demon makes people feel morally superior and more knowledgeable than others .
The demon makes its victim feel very comfortable as there is no contradictory data in view .
The demon is better than a set of rose colored glasses .
The demon 's victim does not understand why everyone else does n't fall down and accept the victim 's views .
After all , the world is thought to be as the victim sees it and the demon does n't let through the gate the knowledge that others do n't see the same thing .
Because of this , the victim assumes that everyone else is biased , or holding those views so that they can keep their job , or , in an even more devious attack by my demon , they think that their opponents are actually demon possessed themselves or sons of Satan .
This is a devious demon !
He can make people think that the geologic column does n't exist even if one posts examples on the internet .
He can make people believe that radioactive dating does n't work even if you show them comparisons of tree rings compared to radiocarbon dating .
He can make people ignore layer after layer of footprints and burrows in the geologic column ( see http://www.flash.net/~mortongr/burrow.jpg ) and believe that burrowing can occur and animals can walk around unimpeded during a global flood .
He can make people think that the sun is shrinking , that the stars are all within 6000 light years of the earth , or that God made pictures in that light of events which never happened .
He can make people believe that fossils are n't the remains of animals and are ' petrifactions ' placed there by the devil .
He can make people ignore modern measurements of continental motion , stellar formation , or biological speciation .
He can make people believe that 75,000 feet of sediment over an area 200 by 100 miles can be deposited in a few hundred years , and he can make people believe that Noah trained animals to poop into buckets on command .
He can make people deny transitional forms which have traits clearly halfway between two groups .
This is a dangerous demon .
But one thing that those unaffected by this demon do n't understand is that the victim is not lying about the data .
The demon only lets his victim see what the demon wants him to see and thus the victim , whose sensory input is horribly askew , feels that he is totally honest about the data .
The victim does n't know that he is the host to an evil parasite and indeed many of their opponents do n't know that as well since the demon is smart enough to be too small to be seen .
But unlike Maxwell 's demon , Morton 's demon does n't expend any energy -- he gets his victim to expend it for him .
He can get his victim to expend massive amounts of intellectual energy figuring out how to convince the world that they are wrong .
The victim will spend hours reading supportive books or searching through scientific literature noting only those portions which support the YEC position .
And the victim will spend lots of energy trying to convince others to come see things the way they do .
Thus , the demon gets its victims to spend energy to help it spread the infection .
The demon drives his victim to go to YEC conventions so that the demon can rest .
By making his victim be with those equally afflicted , the demon does n't have to shut the door or even be watchful .
This is because it allows the demon time to rest when all that is in the room is supportive data .
For the victim , there is comfort in numbers even if they are few .
Those who try to help the poor victims escape the ravages of Morton 's demon wear themselves out typing e-mails explaining data and facts which never get through the demon 's gate .
After years of weariness , the philanthropic individual dies of fatigue .
This is oh so devilish a situation !

Widespread media reports claim that a German schoolboy has recalculated the likelihood of a deadly planet - smasher asteroid hitting the Earth , and found the catastrophe is enormously more likely than NASA thought .
The boy 's sums were said to have been checked by both NASA and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , and found to be correct .
There 's only one problem with the story : the kid 's sums are in fact wrong , NASA 's are right , and the ESA swear blind they never said any different .
An ESA spokesman in Germany told the Reg this morning : " A small boy did do these calculations , but he made a mistake ... NASA 's figures are correct . "
It would appear that the intial article in the Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten , which says that NASA and the ESA endorsed Nico Marquardt 's calculations , was incorrect .
The story was picked up by German tabloids and the AFP news wire , and is now all over the internet .
Marquardt apparently reckoned that the odds of the well - known Apophis asteroid hitting Earth were not one in 45,000 as assessed by NASA , but rather one in 450 .
Apophis will pass close by Earth in 2029 and 2036 , so close that it will come nearer than satellites in geostationary orbit .
It seems that Marquardt 's calculations included the possibility of collision with a satellite in some way not thought to have been covered by NASA , which bumped up the odds of a subsequent Earth strike .
But NASA says :
[ The asteroid will pass ] within the distance of Earth 's geosynchronous satellites .
However , because Apophis will pass interior to the positions of these satellites at closest approach , in a plane inclined at 40 degrees to the Earth 's equator and passing outside the equatorial geosynchronous zone when crossing the equatorial plane , it does not threaten the satellites in that heavily populated region .
All in all , it seems there 's no need to dust off the asteroid - busting space nukes just yet . ®

Embryos exposed to crabs preferred them as prey later in life
It 's a bit like something out of the famous sci- fi horror movie Alien .
Before they have even hatched , cuttlefish embryos can peer out of their eggs and spot potential prey .
It is the first time any animal has been shown to learn visual images before they are born .
Ludovic Dickel and his colleagues at the University of Caen Basse - Normandy , France , made the discovery by placing crabs alongside cuttlefish eggs in a series of laboratory tanks .
Those embryos exposed to crabs preferred them as prey later in life , the scientists report in the journal Animal Behaviour .
The young embryos must be able to see through their translucent egg case , the scientists believe , and learn which animals are worth hunting even before they have hatched .
" This is the first time there is evidence of visual learning by embryos , " said Dr Dickel .
Visual cues Embryos are known to able to pick up chemical and auditory cues - unborn gulls , for example , learn to recognise the alarm calls of their parents whilst still in the egg , while salmon and frog embryos can learn the chemical signatures of the surrounding water before they hatch .
But until now , no one has looked at whether unborn animals can also learn visual images .
Dickel and his team decided to study embryos of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis , a relatively advanced ocean - going mollusc closely related to squid and octopus .
Majestic but deadly : Cuttlefish are efficient killers
They harvested wild eggs , and placed them in tanks filled with sea water .
Crabs , a common prey of adult cuttlefish , were also placed into the tanks , but enclosed in separate compartments .
Crucially , the compartment sides were made of clear glass , so the crabs were in plain view of the eggs .
But the embryos could not smell or hear the crabs .
Once the cuttlefish embryos hatched , they were instantly moved , to ensure they could not glimpse the crabs , and were not exposed to any other prey until they were seven days old .
They were then set free in a lab tank full crabs and shrimp , another cuttlefish delicacy .
' Window of genius '
Remarkably , cuttlefish embryos not exposed to crabs preferred to hunt shrimp once they were born .
But those embryos exposed to crabs much preferred to hunt crabs after hatching .
And the clearer the view of the crabs they were given , the greater their taste for it .
Dickel says that his team has recently discovered that extremely young cuttlefish have very good memories and are capable of astonishing feats of learning , despite their young age and tiny , immature brains .
But this " window of genius " , as he puts it , appears to open even before hatching .
Usually , cuttlefish eggs lie in an envelope full of black ink .
But this clears as the embryos grow older , leaving them growing within translucent eggs .
These unborn cuttlefish also have fully developed eyes .
That leads the researchers to conclude that the cuttlefish embryos must peer through their eggs , and learn to recognise their prey , a behaviour which will help give them a head - start in life .
It is less likely that birds , reptiles and , particularly , mammals - including humans - could recognise visual images in the womb .
But the cuttlefish discovery helps reinforce the idea that some animals at least can begin to learn before they are born .

What are these ?
Toyota , rightly or wrongly , is widely considered the greenest automaker , and the company hopes to solidify its hold on the title and move beyond oil through a sweeping plan to produce cleaner , more efficient cars – beginning with a plug - in hybrid it will produce by 2010 .
It 's no secret Toyota 's been working on a plug - in hybrid to compete against the forthcoming Chevrolet Volt , but Wednesday 's announcement sets a firm deadline and makes it clear Toyota has no plans of ceding the green mantle to General Motors .
It also underscores how quickly the race to build a viable mass - market electric car is heating up .
The company 's ambitious " low - carbon " agenda includes cranking out 1 million hybrids a year and eventually offering hybrid versions of every model it sells .
In the short - term , Toyota says it will produce more fuel efficient gasoline and diesel engines and push alternative fuels like cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel .
It 's also pumping big money into lithium - ion batteries .
With fuel prices going through the roof and auto sales going through the floor because of it , Toyota president Katsuaki Watanabe says the auto industry has no choice but to move beyond petroleum .
" Without focusing on measures to address global warming and energy issues , there can be no future for our auto business , " he told reporters in Tokyo , adding , " Our view is that oil production will peak in the near future .
We need to develop power train (s ) for alternative energy sources . "
Watanabe 's reference to peak oil echoes that of GM CEO Rick Wagoner , who in explaining the company 's decision to shut down four truck factories said rising fuel prices and mounting demand for efficient cars are " structural , not cyclical . "
In other words , the two biggest automakers in the world realize petroleum 's days are numbered .
That 's not to say the wells will run dry anytime soon or the bulk of Toyota 's cars wo n't rely upon internal combustion for many years to come .
" People often ask us whether the vehicles of the future will be hybrid vehicles or clean diesel cars or electric vehicles , " Watanabe said .
" Our answer is that it will not be one technology because energy situations vary from one market to another . "
Still , Toyota is betting heavily on batteries to increasingly augment gasoline .
The world 's leading producer of hybrids – worldwide sales of the Prius recently topped 1 million , 10 years after its introduction – wants to stay there by producing that many hybrids each year " as early in the 2010s as possible . "
Looking further into the future , Watanabe says Toyota will introduce hybrid versions of every car in its line - up sometime between 2020 and 2029 .
Reaching those goals will require bringing down the cost of lithium - ion batteries , which currently cost $ 1,000 per kilowatt hour , according to Tom Turrentine of the Plug - in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC - Davis .
Toyota is joining longtime battery partner Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. in launching a program to develop batteries it says will outperform lithium - ion batteries .
It 's assigning 50 engineers to the project , according to Reuters , and plans to begin producing batteries next year .
Full production is slated for 2010 , although Toyota is n't saying how many it might build .
It also plans to continue building the nickel - metal hydride batteries it currently uses in hybrids .
The third - generation Prius , due next year , will use NiMH batteries .
The plug - in hybrid coming in 2010 will use lithium - ion batteries and will " be geared toward fleet customers in Japan , ( the ) United States and Europe , " the company said .
There 's no word on when it might be offered to the rest of us , but Toyota promises to " accelerate development of small electric vehicles for mass production . "
Toyota is n't giving up on internal combustion , though .
It 's already revamping its engines to make them more efficient , developing 1.3 - and 2.5 - liter engines that will propel much of its line - up by 2010 .
The smaller of the two is fitted with a start - stop system to maximize fuel economy .
Toyota also plans to roll out a six - speed manual transmission this fall .
It 's also working with outside partners to develop cellulosic ethanol from yeast and diesel fuel from biomass .
And , like everyone else in the industry , Toyota pushing hydrogen and its FCHV - adv fuel - cell vehicle .

Each spring , the cycle of death begins anew .
Nitrogen and phosphorus , leached from fertilizer , pass from farmland into streams , from streams into rivers — the Mississippi , the Potomac , the Susquehanna — and then , finally , into some of the country 's great bodies of water : the Gulf of Mexico , the Chesapeake Bay .
There the chemicals collect each summer , spawning the growth of algae , which deplete the water of oxygen and lead to ghostly aquatic wastelands .
Marine life , if mobile enough , will swim away ; the rest will suffocate and die .
Scientists have monitored the growth of these so - called dead zones since the late 1970s .
They have tried to promote policies to reduce their size , without much success .
Last summer , the dead zone along the Gulf of Mexico coast spanned nearly 8,000 square miles — its third - largest occurrence on record and roughly the size of Massachusetts .
Although states have tried to address the problem , cooperation among them is suffering , and federal leadership and funding are lagging .
And now , scientists say , there is a new obstacle : the impact of ethanol production on water quality .
Spurred by recent ethanol mandates and , to a lesser extent , high commodity prices , U.S. farmers are planting record - size crops .
From 2006 to 2007 , corn acres rose by about 15 million , mostly in the Mississippi River basin .
Mid-Atlantic farmers are expected to plant 500,000 more acres of corn , soybeans , and wheat this year than they did in 2006 , a 7 percent jump .
To grow more crops , particularly corn , farmers usually have to use more fertilizer .
Fertilizer runoff is the primary contributor to dead zone formation , the source of three quarters of the nitrogen and more than half of the phosphorous in the water .
In a recent study , researchers at the University of British Columbia and the University of Wisconsin found that the U.S. government 's goal to produce 36 billion gallons of ethanol by 2022 , with a maximum of 15 billion from corn , would most likely increase the nitrogen flow to the Gulf by 10 to 20 percent .
" It is hard to be critical of a farmer if your crop is all you have , " says Simon Donner , the paper 's coauthor .
Yet the new biofuel policies , he says , seem to make it all but impossible to control dead zones in the near future , since cleaning up the Gulf would require at least a 30 percent reduction in nitrogen levels .
As is often the case , federal subsidies benefit some at the expense of others .
Hard data are lacking , but anecdotes of economic distress abound .
At the end of last summer , for example , fishermen , crabbers , and shrimpers in Grand Isle , La. , called a news conference to call attention to the threat of dead zones to their livelihood .
Some reported hauls down hundreds of thousands of pounds .
The ecological impact may be worse :
Unlike nitrogen , which eventually evaporates as a gas , phosphorus lingers in the water , contributing to dead zones of the future and the potential for significant environmental damage .
Finding more .
Not only are dead zones not going away , scientists say , but they are becoming more frequent and intense .
A 2004 U.N. report documented nearly 150 dead zones worldwide , and scientists continue to come across new ones , including some apparently caused by climate change .
Researchers at Oregon State University , for example , identified a recurring dead zone in the Pacific Northwest in 2002 ; during the 2006 cycle , it caused " mass die - offs " of marine life on the seafloor .
So far , the federal response has been desultory .
In 2001 , a government task force called for a 75 percent reduction in the size of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone by 2015 .
It was an ambitious goal and ultimately a hollow one .
Virtually no federal funding has been provided .
Instead , states were asked to address the problem voluntarily ; little coordination followed .
A new " action plan " for the Gulf was released in March , but that plan merely called upon individual states to propose solutions " as soon as possible , but no later than 2013 . "
Efforts in the Chesapeake region have met similar problems .
Last year , local officials acknowledged that the goal of cleaning up the bay by 2010 would not be met .
A report card issued by the University of Maryland puts the bay 's overall health at a C- , up from a D+ in 2006 .
Stopping runoff .
Congress recently passed a sweeping farm bill that provides , for the first time , more than $ 400 million to improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay .
No doubt that money will be useful .
Leaky septic tanks in thousands of private homes need replacement ; sewage treatment facilities could benefit from newer technologies .
But experts say the biggest help could come from better conservation practices , such as fences or buffer strips to help prevent runoff .
" I once did a survey of Iowa farmers , " says Donald Scavia , a professor in the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan and an expert on dead zones .
" They said they would be absolutely willing to do those things if they would be paid to do them .
They want to live in a landscape that is more diverse , but they do n't want to lose money doing it . "
It 's not your normal , electronic silicon - based machine , but scientists have made a computer from a small , circular piece of DNA , then inserted it into a living bacterial cell and unleashed the microbe to solve a mathematical sorting problem .
" A computer is any system that can read some input and give some readable output , " says Karmella Haynes , a biologist at Davidson College in North Carolina and co-author of a new study appearing in the Journal of Biological Engineering .
Haynes and her team looked to harness the power of DNA recombination to solve the so - called " burnt pancake problem " : a puzzle about how to stack different - size flapjacks that are burned on one side and perfectly cooked on the other using the fewest number of flips to arrange them so the largest are on the bottom and all are golden side up .
" This work is the first work I 've encountered which uses living cells in order to solve a specific computer science problem , " says Tom Ran , a graduate student in the lab of computer scientist Ehud Shapiro at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot , Israel .
By showing that DNA functioning as a computer would be able to solve the burnt pancake problem , Haynes and her team demonstrated that if their system could be scaled - up , it could spit out answers to complex problems like the most efficient air routes between Chicago and Singapore or the best way to route phone calls around the U.S. — conundrums that companies like FedEx and AT&T have grappled with for years — in a fraction of the time that it takes conventional computers to do .
Researchers have envisioned using DNA computers for several other applications , such as a way to detect changes in live systems — like cancer within the body or the spread of contaminants in a lake .
" DNA computers may be able to accomplish things that electronic computers cannot , " says Len Adleman , a molecular scientist at the University of Southern California .
" For example , it is very hard to conceive putting an electronic , silicon - based computer into a bacterial cell . "
A team of researchers from Davidson and Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph inserted a free - standing , circular piece of DNA ( called a plasmid ) into a benign strain of the single - celled intestinal bacteria Escherichia coli , some strains of which can cause food poisoning .
The team modeled a simple two - pancake flip problem using two segments of DNA — one large and one short , which were inserted into the cell in a random order and orientation .
The scientists also added an enzyme from the Salmonella bacteria that is capable of flipping genetic fragments .
The segments would require a certain number of flips in a given amount of time to place them in the correct configuration .
Arriving at the correct orientation has a reward for each germ : immunity from the antibiotic , tetracycline .
After a set period of time , the little computers were exposed to the antibiotic — only the ones with the proper segment orientation survived .
From this , the researchers could tell which cells had correctly solved the flipping problem , because the ones who did n't died .
The promise of DNA computers in cells lives in the opportunity for parallel processing :
Because cells are alive and replicate , copying the plasmid segments and the Salmonella enzyme into new cells , the number of individual processors working on a problem continuously multiplies , potentially allowing them to reach a solution faster than electronic silicon - based computers , Haynes explains .
Whereas the two - flapjack version of the burnt pancake problem used in the study is relatively simple , the researchers point out that for a stack of six pancakes , the possible number of stacks is 46,080 , and for 12 , nearly two trillion .
" If you had 11 or 12 pancakes , Haynes says , " then a conventional computer would take something on the order of months to solve the problem . "
Medical Mystery : The Boy Who Could n't Sleep Since birth , Rhett Lamb , 3 , has struggled to get a good night 's sleep .
May 10 , 2008  -- Rhett Lamb , 3 , is often irritable , but it 's not just the routine growing pains of a toddler 's life that has affected him .
It 's the fact that Rhett can't sleep .
" We went to the doctor after he was born , and I kept telling him something was wrong .
He did n't sleep .
They thought I was being kind of an anxious mom , and we went back and forth , " Rhett 's mother , Shannon Lamb , said .
" Finally , they [ were ] starting to realize now that he really does n't sleep at all .
But we 've had a lot of different diagnoses and nobody really knows . "
His sleep deprivation caused made him very irritable .
" That 's going to have a great impact on his behavior during the day -- his irritability , his ability to eat -- and I 'm sure it also impacted the parents tremendously , " said Marie Savard , an ABC News medical consultant .
Rhett is awake nearly 24 hours a day , and his condition has baffled his parents and doctors for years .
They took clock shifts watching his every sleep - deprived mood to determine what ailed the young boy .
After a number of conflicting opinions , Shannon and David Lamb finally learned what was wrong with their child : Doctors diagnosed Rhett with an extremely rare condition called chiari malformation .
" The brain literally is squeezed into the spinal column .
What happens is you get compression , squeezing , strangulating of the brain stem , which has all the vital functions that control sleep , speech , our cranial nerves , our circulatory system , even our breathing system , " Savard said .
In order to relieve the pressure on Rhett 's brain stem , doctors performed surgery this week that they hope will allow him to sleep properly for the first time in his life .
Surgeons made an incision at the base of Rhett 's skull to the top of his neck and removed the bone around the brain stem and spinal cord , which produced more space .
" Doing the decompression , relieving that pressure , should absolutely improve those symptoms , " Savard said .
Still , doctors said the Lambs may not see major changes for several months or possibly even a year .
But Rhett 's parents hope their son will be able to get some rest and be normal .
" There is a 50 - 50 chance that the sleep will improve , " Shannon Lamb said .
" Once the sleep improves , we can work on the behavioral stuff .
He 's very irritable all of the time .
" I would love to see him play and have a good time and be happy , " she said .
Karl Rove lashes out at NYT for identifying CIA agent
Sometimes , the irony is so overwhelming , I have to wonder if it ’s some kind of satirical performance art , and I ’m just not in on the joke .
Consider this fascinating exchange between Bill O’Reilly and Karl Rove on Fox News last night :
For those who ca n’t watch video clips online , O’Reilly , referencing an NYT article published over the weekend , said that the Times had “ outed a CIA agent , ” which “ obviously puts the CIA agent in danger . ”
Rove accused the paper of maintaining a “ double standard .
It is deeply concerned when Richard Armitage outed Valerie Plame .
Of course , they were only concerned until the point that it became apparent that it was Richard Armitage , not Karl Rove . ”
Rove added that the NYT has “ a very callous view about our nation ’s security and interests , ” and has “ put our country at risk . ”
There are two key angles to this .
First , the NYT article did , in fact , identify the CIA interrogator who questioned Khalid Shaikh Mohammed .
The article characterizes him as one of the good guys , gaining information through non-abusive means .
Indeed , the interrogator , who refused training on how to waterboard a detainee , established a rapport with the terrorist — which “ astonished his fellow C.I.A. officers ” — by talking and bringing KSM food .
The article , in other words , was n’t a slam job .
So why include his name ?
It was a judgment call , but the Times explained that the interrogator “ had never worked under cover and that others involved in the campaign against Al Qaeda have been named in news stories and books .
The editors judged that the name was necessary for the credibility and completeness of the article . ”
Whether one finds this responsible or not is open to debate .
But for Karl Rove to have the chutzpah to lambaste the Times for this is extraordinary .
Indeed , as Rove has become a media personality — paid by Fox News , the Wall Street Journal , and Newsweek — he ’s continued to argue that he was n’t involved with leaking the identity of an undercover CIA agent .
TP ’s Satyam offers a quick reminder :
* Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper said , “ Karl Rove told me about Valerie Plame ’s identity on July 11 , 2003 .
I called him because Ambassador Wilson [ Plame ’s husband ] was in the news that week .
I did n’t know Ambassador Wilson even had a wife until I talked to Karl Rove . ” *
A week prior to publishing his column which outed Plame , Robert Novak spoke with Rove .
Novak brought up Plame ’s role at the CIA , and Rove confirmed that Plame worked at the CIA : “ I heard that too , ” said Rove .
The Times identified a CIA agent who was n’t undercover in order to publish a credible and complete news story .
Rove identified a CIA agent who was undercover in order to push back against her husband ’s criticism of the White House .
And then Rove lied about it .
Tell me again who has “ a very callous view about our nation ’s security and interests ” ?
Researchers now spend a lot of time trying to understand universal moral intuitions .
Genes are not merely selfish , it appears .
Instead , people seem to have deep instincts for fairness , empathy and attachment .
Scientists have more respect for elevated spiritual states .
Andrew Newberg of the University of Pennsylvania has shown that transcendent experiences can actually be identified and measured in the brain ( people experience a decrease in activity in the parietal lobe , which orients us in space ) .
The mind seems to have the ability to transcend itself and merge with a larger presence that feels more real .
This new wave of research will not seep into the public realm in the form of militant atheism .
Instead it will lead to what you might call neural Buddhism .
If you survey the literature ( and I ’d recommend books by Newberg , Daniel J. Siegel , Michael S. Gazzaniga , Jonathan Haidt , Antonio Damasio and Marc D. Hauser if you want to get up to speed ) , you can see that certain beliefs will spread into the wider discussion .
First , the self is not a fixed entity but a dynamic process of relationships .
Second , underneath the patina of different religions , people around the world have common moral intuitions .
Third , people are equipped to experience the sacred , to have moments of elevated experience when they transcend boundaries and overflow with love .
Fourth ,
God can best be conceived as the nature one experiences at those moments , the unknowable total of all there is .
In their arguments with Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins , the faithful have been defending the existence of God .
That was the easy debate .
The real challenge is going to come from people who feel the existence of the sacred , but who think that particular religions are just cultural artifacts built on top of universal human traits .
It ’s going to come from scientists whose beliefs overlap a bit with Buddhism .
In unexpected ways , science and mysticism are joining hands and reinforcing each other .
That ’s bound to lead to new movements that emphasize self - transcendence but put little stock in divine law or revelation .
Orthodox believers are going to have to defend particular doctrines and particular biblical teachings .
They ’re going to have to defend the idea of a personal God , and explain why specific theologies are true guides for behavior day to day .
I ’m not qualified to take sides , believe me .
I ’m just trying to anticipate which way the debate is headed .
We ’re in the middle of a scientific revolution .
It ’s going to have big cultural effects .

We get ’em both ?
Yep , the state of Minnesota — and the city of St. Paul — will not only host the McCain Republican coronation in September , but apparently also a big Obama Democratic victory rally on Tuesday .
Sen . Barack Obama will declare victory as the Democratic nominee for President at 8 p.m. Tuesday night in St. Paul , Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak told the Pioneer Press this evening .
It ’ll be free , open to all , and , organizers hope , big .
Of course , there is no way to know if he ’ll actually have the delegates in hand to secure the nomination Tuesday .
But the symbolism is clearly there : Sources say Obama will declare victory at Xcel Energy Center — the same building where Sen .
John McCain is expected to be nominated as his party ’s candidate at the Republican National Convention in September .
Tuesday ’s the night of the final Democratic primaries , in South Dakota and Montana .
Rybak , who chairs Obama ’s Minnesota campaign , said Tuesday ’s event is not contingent on how Obama fares at the polls against his opponent Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
“ He is the nominee , ” Rybak said .
“ He will be coming here . ”
The Minnesota GOP reacted quickly , with party Chairman Ron Carey issuing a statement that attacked some of Obama ’s foreign policy positions .
“ I could n’t be happier , ” Carey said of Obama bringing the battle to St. Paul .
And Matt Burns , spokesman for the Sept. 1 - 4 convention , said , in part , “ We remain focused on planning the best possible convention – where Sen.
McCain will share his positive vision with the American people . ”
Obama ’s campaign contacted the Xcel Energy Center to see if the arena is available , Xcel spokeswoman Kathy O’Connor said tonight .
“ Nothing is confirmed yet … but obviously we ’re very excited , ” O’Connor told the Pioneer Press .
“ We would be thrilled to host .
If anything happens , we ’ll be prepared . ”
The choice of venue is a mischievous , aggressive way for the Illinois Democrat to unofficially kick off the general election campaign against McCain , a Republican from Arizona .
The location gives huge meaning to the moment , with Obama likely to frame a tough case against his new opponent in the very hall where McCain will accept his party ’s nomination .
Rybak said the choice to give St. Paul a two - for was made by senior officials inside Obama ’s campaign .
“ They looked all over the country , and we ’re proud they picked Minnesota , ” Rybak said .
“ It symbolizes how important Minnesota has been through this whole process and the Obama campaign . ”
Minnesota looks to be a natural choice .
No other state has voted as consistently Democratic in presidential races as Minnesota — even with the close races in 2000 and 2004 .
Eleven of the last 12 Democratic presidential candidates carried the state .
It last went Republican in 1972 .
The news of Obama ’s visit has created a rapidly spreading buzz among political circles , as observers mull the possibilities of what could be a historic speech — the first black nominee of a major party launching his de facto presidential run — on the banks of the Mississippi River in the Upper Midwest .
Buck Humphrey , chair of the Clinton campaign in Minnesota , was contacted and said he needed to review the Pioneer Press story before commenting .
THE task of peering into the cosmos and discovering strange new galaxies sounds like a job for astronomers armed with big and very expensive telescopes .
But almost a year ago that all changed when a group of stargazers decided to ask the public to help in a project to explore the northern sky .
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey had been looking in this part of space for 16 years , producing so much information that astronomers assumed they would never get through it .
So the public was let loose , to help sort what they had found .
The scheme is called the Galaxy Zoo project .
It was so popular , says Alex Szalay , an astronomer at John Hopkins University , Maryland , that the computer servers on which the project ran “ literally overheated and blew a fuse ” .
More important , within a month of the opening , Hanny van Arkel , a physics teacher from the Netherlands , posted a message on the zoo 's forum about some strange blue stuff she had spotted and asked what it might be .
By January the zoo's professional keepers had started to pay attention to what the teacher had called a voorwerp , the Dutch word for object .
Now it is becoming famous .
William Keel , an astronomer at the University of Alabama , took another picture of the voorwerp and suggested that the human eye would probably see it as green , rather than blue as in the original picture .
It also has a giant hole at its centre .
What this object might be was a complete mystery at first .
It was initially thought to be a distant galaxy , says Chris Lintott , an Oxford University astronomer involved in the project .
But after further study astronomers realised that there were no stars in it , and so it must be a cloud of gas .
But why the gas was so hot ( about 15,000 ºC ) was a mystery , because there seemed to be no stars to heat it up .
Now , in a posting on the Galaxy Zoo blog , Dr Keel and Dr Lintott suggest that the galaxy right next door to the voorwerp used to be a quasar ( a very bright active galactic nucleus ) that has since eaten up all its fuel .
This quasar lit up the nearby gas , and although the quasar has since gone out , the light from it is still travelling to the object .
The blob , says Dr Lintott , sees the galaxy as it was 40,000 years ago .
This makes the voorwerp a sort of light echo but on a massive scale .
Smaller light echoes have been seen around supernovae .
As for the giant hole , Dr Lintott has “ no sensible explanation ” for that at the moment and needs to wait for more telescope time .
The weird blob could become immortalised as Hanny 's Voorwerp , the name given to the object in a paper Dr Lintott and his colleagues are submitting to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
And towards the end of the year , if the mission to service the Hubble telescope goes as planned , a high - quality image of the voorwerp could emerge .
Data direct
Earlier projects in distributed computing , such as SETI@home , which searched for extraterrestrial life , have used the power of millions of home computers .
But more recently , scientists have begun to realise that distributed human brain power itself can be a useful commodity , as in working out the shape of proteins .
Dr Szalay says that the voorwerp episode has shown how immensely valuable the public can be .
When the data were put online Dr Szalay thought it was only a matter of time before someone made a big discovery .
“ It just happened much faster than we thought . ”
In the past year 40 m classifications of galaxies have been submitted on 1 m galactic objects in the Galaxy Zoo .
Dr Lintott says that the project has proved that the public en masse is as good as professional astronomers at classifying galaxies .
The next step is to ask people to do more complicated things , such as keeping an eye out for weird objects , which is bound to appeal to armchair astronomers .
Hanny 's object had been there for decades , unnoticed in the astronomical archives .
The idea now is for the public to explore strange new galaxies ; to seek out new voorwerps and to boldly go where no amateur has gone before .
Commentary : The Ethanol Fallacy
The Economic , Environmental and Ethical Problems of Using Corn for Fuel
byDavid is Professor of Entomology at the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University .
Article published with his permission .
Dwindling foreign oil , rising prices at the gas pump and hype from politically well - connected U.S. agribusiness have combined to create a frenzied rush to convert food grains into ethanol fuel .
The move is badly conceived and ill advised .
Corporate spin and pork barrel legislation aside , here , by the numbers , are the scientific reasons why corn wo n't provide our energy needs :
- First , using corn or any other biomass for ethanol requires huge regions of fertile land , plus massive amounts of water and sunlight to maximize crop production .
All green plants in the United States - including all crops , forests and grasslands , combined - collect about 32 quads ( 32 x 1015 BTU ) of sunlight energy per year .
The American population today burns more than three times that amount of energy annually as fossil fuels .
There is n't even close to enough biomass in America to supply our biofuel needs .
- Second , biofuel enthusiasts - including agribusiness lobbyists and PR firms - suggest that ethanol produced from corn and cellulosic biomass such as grasses could replace much of the oil used in the United States .
But consider that 20 percent of the U.S. corn crop was converted into 5 billion gallons of ethanol in 2006 , and that amount replaced only 1 percent of U.S. oil consumption .
If the entire national corn crop were used to make ethanol , it would replace a mere 7 percent of U.S. oil consumption , far from making the United States independent of foreign oil .
- Third , ethanol production is energy intensive : Cornell University 's up - to - date analysis of the 14 energy inputs that go into corn production , plus the nine energy inputs invested in ethanol fermentation and distillation , confirms that more than 140 percent of the energy contained in one gallon of corn ethanol is expended to produce it .
The energy expended to make ethanol comes mostly from oil and natural gas .
Some investigators conveniently omit several of these energy inputs required in corn production and processing , such as energy for farm labor , farm machinery , energy production of hybrid corn-seed , irrigation and processing equipment .
Omitting energy inputs wrongly suggests that a corn-ethanol production system offers a more positive energy return .
In reality , corn is an inefficient choice from an energy - cost and transport standpoint .
Cellulosic ethanol also is touted loudly as a replacement for corn ethanol .
Unfortunately , cellulose biomass production requires major energy inputs to release minimal amounts of tightly bound starches and sugars needed to make fuel .
About 70 percent more energy - coming , again , from precious oil and gas - is required to produce ethanol from cellulosic biomass than the energy contained in the ethanol produced .
That makes cellulosic ethanol an even poorer performer than corn ethanol .
Also , the production of corn ethanol is highly subsidized : State and federal governments pay out more than $ 6 billion per year in subsidies , according to a 2006 report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development in Geneva , Switzerland .
Calculated on a per-gallon basis , these subsidies are more than 60 times those for gasoline .
Moreover , the environmental impacts of corn ethanol production are serious and diverse .
These include severe soil erosion of valuable food cropland , plus the heavy use of nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides that pollute rivers .
Fermenting corn to make one gallon of ethanol produces 12 gallons of noxious sewage effluent .
Making ethanol requires the use of fossil fuels , releasing large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , adding to global warming .
- Finally , using food crops such as corn to produce ethanol raises major nutritional and ethical concerns .
Nearly 60 percent of the people on Earth are malnourished according to the World Health Organization .
Growing crops for fuel squanders land , water and energy vital for human food production .
The use of corn for ethanol has increased the price of U.S. beef , chicken , pork , eggs , breads , cereals and milk - a boon to agribusiness but a bane to consumers .
Jacques Diouf , the director general of the U.N. Food & Agriculture Organization , reports that using 22 pounds of corn to produce one gallon of ethanol already is causing food shortages for the world 's poor .
One last set of statistics :
The global population stands at 6.6 billion : A quarter - million mouths to feed are added daily .
Energy experts report that the peak of oil production already has been reached .
As cheap oil supplies decline , fuel prices will rise , causing food prices to climb , too , because maximum agricultural production requires the use of fossil fuels .
As global population soars to 8 billion or more toward mid-century and as we burn more grain as fuel , shortages and production costs could cause grain prices to skyrocket , taking food from the mouths of the world 's poorest people .
The science is clear :
The use of corn and other biofuels to solve our energy problem is an ethically , economically and environmentally unworkable sham .
Question for the day : what do libertarianism and the Many - Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics have in common ?
Interest in the two worldviews seems to be positively correlated : think of quantum computing pioneer David Deutsch , or several prominent posters over at Overcoming Bias , or … oh , alright , my sample size is admittedly pretty small .
Some connections are obvious : libertarianism and MWI are both grand philosophical theories that start from premises that almost all educated people accept ( quantum mechanics in the one case , Econ 101 in the other ) , and claim to reach conclusions that most educated people reject , or are at least puzzled by ( the existence of parallel universes / the desirability of eliminating fire departments ) .
Both theories seem to have a strong following with nerds who read science fiction and post to Internet discussion groups , but a relatively poorer following with both John Q. Public and Alistair K. Intellectual .
( Needless to say , these stereotypes tell us almost nothing about the theories ’ validity . )
My own hypothesis has to do with bullet - dodgers versus bullet - swallowers .
A bullet - dodger is a person who says things like :
Sure , obviously if you pursued that particular line of reasoning to an extreme , then you ’d get such - and - such an absurd - seeming conclusion .
But that very fact suggests that other forces might come into play that we do n’t understand yet or have n’t accounted for .
So let ’s just make a mental note of it and move on .
Faced with exactly the same situation , a bullet - swallower will exclaim :
The entire world should follow the line of reasoning to precisely this extreme , and this is the conclusion , and if a ‘ consensus of educated opinion ’ finds it disagreeable or absurd , then so much the worse for educated opinion !
Those who accept this are intellectual heroes ; those who do n’t are cowards .
In a lifetime of websurfing , I do n’t think I ’ve ever read an argument by a libertarian or a Many - Worlds proponent that did n’t sound like the latter .
We know plenty of historical examples where the bullet - swallowers were gloriously right : Moore ’s Law , Darwinism , the abolition of slavery , women ’s rights .
On the other hand , at various points within the last 150 years , extremely smart people also reasoned themselves to the inescapable conclusions that aether had to exist for light to be a wave in , that capitalism was reaching its final crisis , that only a world government could prevent imminent nuclear war , and that space colonies would surely exist by 2000 .
In those cases , even if you could n’t spot any flaws in the arguments , you still would ’ve been wise to doubt their conclusions .
( Or are you sure you would have spotted the flaws where Maxwell and Kelvin , Russell and Einstein did not ? )
Here ’s a favorite analogy .
The world is a real - valued function that ’s almost completely unknown to us , and that we only observe in the vicinity of a single point x 0 .
To our surprise , we find that , within that tiny vicinity , we can approximate the function extremely well by a Taylor series .
“ Aha ! ” exclaim the bullet - swallowers .
“ So then the function must be the infinite series , neither more nor less . ”
“ Not so fast , ” reply the bullet - dodgers .
“ All we know is that we can approximate the function in a small open interval around x 0 .
Who knows what unsuspected phenomena might be lurking beyond it ? ”
“ Intellectual cowardice ! ” the first group snorts .
“ You ’re just like the Jesuit schoolmen , who dismissed the Copernican system as a mere calculational device !
Why ca n’t you accept what our best theory is clearly telling us ? ”
So who ’s right : the bullet - swallowing libertarian Many - Worlders , or the bullet - dodging intellectual kibitzers ?
Well , that depends on whether the function is sin( x ) or log(x ) .
We can never forget that everything that Hitler did in Germany was ‘ legal , ’ and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did was ‘ illegal . ’
It was ‘ illegal ’ to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler ’s Germany , but I am sure that if I lived in Germany during that time I would have comforted my Jewish brothers even though it was illegal … we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension .
We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive .
— Martin Luther King , Jr.
There have been over 15,000 arrests for resistance to war since 2002 .
There were large numbers right after the run up to and invasion of Iraq .
Recently , arrests have begun climbing again .
Though arrests are a small part of anti-war organizing , their rise is an indicator of increasing resistance .
The information comes from the Nuclear Resister , a newsletter that has been reporting detailed arrest information on peace activists and other social justice campaigns since 1980 .
Felice and Jack Cohen - Joppa , publishers of the Nuclear Resister , document arrests by name and date based on information collected from newspapers across the country and from defense lawyers and peace activists .
Since 2002 , the Nuclear Resister has documented anti-war arrests for protestors each year :
2002 – 1800 arrests
2003 – 6072 arrests
2004 – 2440 arrests
2005 – 975 arrests
2006 – 950 arrests
2007 – 2272 arrests
2008 – 810 as of May 1
“ Arrests for resistance to war are far more widespread geographically than most people think , ” according to Cohen - Joppa of Nuclear Resister .
“ Yes , there are many arrests in DC and traditional big cities of anti-war activity — like San Francisco , NYC and Chicago , but there have also been anti-war arrests in Albany , Ann Arbor , Atlanta , Bangor , Bath , Bend , Brentwood , Burlington , Campbell , Cedar Rapids , Chapel Hill , Charlottesville , Chicopee , Colorado Springs , Denver , Des Moines , East Hampton , Erie , Eugene , Eureka , Fairbanks , Fairport , Fort Bragg , Fort Wayne , Grand Rapids , Great Dismal Swamp , Hammond , Huntsville , Joliet , Juneau , Kennebunkport , La Crosse , Los Angeles , Madison , Manchester , Memphis , Newark , Northbrook , Olympia , Omaha , Pittsburgh , Portland , Portsmouth , Providence , Richmond , Sacramento , San Diego , Santa Fe , Smithfield , Springfield , St. Louis , St. Paul , Staten Island , Superior , Syracuse , Tacoma , Toledo , Tucson , Tulsa , Vandenberg , Virginia
Beach , Wausau , Wheaton and Wilmington just to name a few . ”
“ In fact , ” notes Cohen - Joppa , “ in 2007 , anti-war arrests were reported during 250 distinct events in 105 cities in 35 states and the District of Columbia .
So far in 2008 , arrests have been reported at 65 events in 43 different cities in 19 states and D.C. ”
An example of the scope of resistance can be found in the Chicago - based Voices for Creative Nonviolence .
They joined with other major peace groups like CODEPINK , Veterans for Peace , and the National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance in early 2007 to launch The Occupation Project , a campaign of resistance aimed at ending the Iraq War .
Theirs was a campaign of sustained nonviolent civil disobedience to end funding for the U.S. war in and occupation of Iraq .
The Occupation Project resulted in over 320 arrests in spring of 2007 in the offices of 39 U.S. Representatives and Senators in 25 states .
“ I am energized by the dedication of so many conscientious activists across the country willing to take the risks of peace and speak truth to power , ” says Max Obuszewski of the National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance .
“ We have been unsuccessful so far in stopping this awful war and occupation of Iraq , but it is not for the lack of direct action .
We are taking on the greatest empire in world history , but we will continue to act . ”
“ There are large numbers of new people being arrested , ” notes Cohen - Joppa , “ most typically saying , ‘ I have tried everything else from writing to voting , but I have to do more to stop this war . ’
The profile of people arrested includes high school teenagers to senior citizens , mostly people under 30 and over 50 . ”
Anti-war arrests are significantly under - reported by mainstream media .
For example , around the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq in March 2008 , most news stories wrote that there were 150 to 200 arrests nationwide .
Cohen - Joppa and Nuclear Resister report there were over double that number , well over 400 , many outside the cities where regular media traditionally look .
Though arrests typically drop off in election years , as people ’s hopes are raised that a new President or Congress will make a difference and stop the war , this year looks like arrests are likely to continue to rise .
In part , that will depend on the attitude of authorities in Denver and Minneapolis , where the political conventions are being held .
In 2004 , New York City authorities overreacted so much to protestors at the Republican convention that they arrested historic numbers of protestors — including hundreds who had no intention to risk arrest .
If Senator McCain is elected , anti-war resistance activities are expected to rise much higher .
Why do people risk arrest in their resistance to war ?
Perhaps Daniel Berrigan , on trial for resistance to the Vietnam War , said it best :
The time is past when good people may be silent
when obedience
can segregate us from public risk
when the poor can die without defense .
How many indeed must die
before our voices are heard
how many must be tortured dislocated
starved maddened ?
How long must the world=s resources
be raped in the service of legalized murder ?
When at what point will you say no to this war ?
We have chosen to say
with the gift of our liberty
if necessary our lives :
the violence stops here .
The death stops here .
The suppression of truth stops here .
This war stops here .
Though war resistance activities and arrests have not stopped the war in Iraq , those struggling for peace remain committed .
“ None of us know what will happen if we continue to work for peace and human rights , ” says a handmade poster of one involved in the resistance , “ But we all know what will happen if we do n’t . ”

Question for Clint Curtis :
IS TOM FEENEY responsible for placing world class hackers as leaders in the GOP so the 2008 election can be hacked from abroad ?
The story of a hacker criminal in the GOP is even on DIGG now .
I know kos and MSM types are afraid of this story , because the cabal the dude is a member of can bring down any website anywhere anytime they want to .
But Brad , you say on your site as it comes up " UNAFRAID " .
This hacker is from your neck of the woods and is in your face .
Are you afraid to run with the biggest hack story never told ?
Bradbloggers like myself would see that as so kos .
Read my post and hey everyone , spread the news around so these guys can't scrub it .

Hey Mark Lindeman , we know you devote tons of hours reading and posting on election integrity message boards .
HudsonValleyMark {sp?} at Dkos.
OnTheOtherHand at Democratic Underground .
Do n't you have students to help out ?
Do n't you need to write some books to get tenured ?
Who the *# $@ do you work for other than Bard College ?
You have overstepped your boundaries .
It is time for you to be exposed .
I saw you in two videos .
One , somehow you were on a panel discussing global warming , explaining how it is so exciting .
On the other , you were talking about annoying citizens who get on hobby horses .
How do I know you are spending an abnormal amount of time on these message boards .
The other day you dug into Brad for not realising who you are at DU .
You ripped into him for making the same mistake he did with Dana Houle , DHinMi or something at the DailyCIAKos .
Mark Lindeman wrote a peper with a known rightwinger Rick Brady , yet he is posting at a democratic website .
He can get fairly mean towards other posters , yet never gets his arse banned .
Same friggen thing happens a lot .
Maybe you have Skinner in your back pocket ?
A google search for OnTheOtherHand Democratic Underground returns 13,000 hits .
OTOH DU
You should have gone away when you had the chance .
Same with your buddy Febble , an Elisabeth Liddle out of England .
Now wtf is she doing on the DU ?
OnTheOtherHand Is Professor Mark Lindeman .
He appears to be a tool for the status quo .
Students , professors , union leaders , peace groups , extra-governmental organisations , etc. , it is time for you to step up to the plate .
It is time we take a lesson from the French and start ramping up the protests .
How long has it been since Murtha said we needed to get the # $@& out of Iraq .

Thank you for this newsworthy election coverage and once again exposing a US mass media monopoly owned by a criminal self serving corporation ( that does n't represent the people ) and told what to say by the greedy , murderous , lying , treasonous , loser pirates known as the bushit administration .

I believe that Lindeman wrote a paper with Republican Rick Brady which backed the " work " of the Election Science Institute .
The other day , Mark , you ripped into Brad for not knowing that you are OnTheOtherHand .
I did n't know you were him either , because I was tombstoned from that place for no good reason .
Unlike Brad , you do n't sign off your posts with your real name .
So Mark , do you know Steven Hertzberg personally ?
Are you still in contact with Rove 's buddy , Matt Damschroeder ?
Because maybe you could ask Steven , a " Navari " at {cough , cough , lol} " Fintan Dunne 's " BreakForDisinfoNews , why he has taken his Election Science Institute off - line .
Thanks in advance , OnTheOtherHand , Mr. Mark Lindeman who finds global warming so exciting .

Ok .
One more .
I should really be getting some shut - eye .
I 'm smelling a lot of rats .
And I know there are some folks out there who are right there seeing the same things I am .
This is not " conspiracy chatter . "
This is called reality backed by facts .
One link I found was to a Professor Freeman article wondering why folks like Liddle and Hertzberg were so involved in the election integrity movement based on their resumes .
That could be for another day .
But this next one , Steven Hertzberg 's brother seemed to by pimping for electronic machines as early as 2001 .
Robert Hertzberg once ran for mayor of Los Angeles .

There are tons of goodies to be found all over the internet .
I 'm hoping Brad can finish some of my snooping around , then both of us can go on Olbermann . :)
The rat is called controlled opposition .
There has been a lot of fake outrage and concern that infiltrated the election integrity movement , fairly soon after Bush was crowned King of America .
True leaders like Brad were to be marginalised as being " conspiracy nutters . "
Fake leaders like Febble , Lindeman , Hertzberg , and David " Kelvin Mace " Allen were propped up as evokers of authority .
The bottom line has been a movement to say : Electronic voting machines are here for good .
Do n't worry about it you democrappers and repiglinuts .
I 'm not sure why no one ever interacts with some of the stuff I come up with , but so be it .
The only way I 'll shut up is if I get banned .
Hey Mark Lindeman , how 's it going ?

Hard - working people suffer daily from exhaustion , insomnia , backaches and other minor ailments .
Perhaps all they need is a dose of preventive medicine in the form of vitamins and other nutritional supplements .
On April 1 , a private service , called Tenteki10 , opened in Ebisu Garden Place , to provide " pick - me-ups " through IV drips .
People can drop by without a reservation and take the 10 - minute instillation right away .
Tenteki10 , which is located on the 4th floor of Ebisu Garden Place Tower , operates as a subsidiary of a medical clinic .
Because it is a medical practice , the drip is given by nurses and doctors .
However , it is not covered by National Health Insurance .
Ten options with different effects and five courses consisting of these options are available .
The basic price is 2,000 yen , and customers can request an option or course menu , for an additional charge .
“ Many people daily suffer from exhaustion , insomnia and backaches on a daily basis because they do n't take proper care of themselves , " says a doctor at Tenteki10 .
" They try supplements , home remedies or cheap energy injections .
Some of these ailments cannot be healed that way and could possibly develop into more serious illnesses , including depression . ”
But the service at Tenteki10 is not " cosmetic , " the doctor adds .
“ It 's ' preventive medicine . '
Also , we do n't publicize this service like a business , nor do we suggest it to anyone .
We just leave leaflets at the clinic .
We think of it as an option for people to raise their awareness of daily health management on their own . ”
A spokesperson for Tenteki10 says , “ We do n't want our customers to believe that the drip service will bring them perfect health .
Although it has strong and quick effects , it is more important that customers be more aware of how to take responsibility for their daily health .
Our service is just one option for them . ”
According to Tenteki10 , about 30 male and female customers a day currently make use of the drip service as remedies for exhaustion as well as for skin care and anti-aging purposes .
Some of them come with their husband , wife or family .

Have n't you heard the latest ?
No , Colonel Westhusing wo n't actually be coming back .
Not in the flesh anyway .
When I mention him ' returning ' in this context , it 's because I figure ' with apologies to the makers of those potato chips ' that the State ought to have a slogan that more accurately describes its feelings about the people in its standing armies .
Something like : ' Kill all you want , we 'll send more . '
No other conclusion can be drawn when one examines only a few of the more recent goings - on through the prism of universal morality and libertarian philosophy .
I already examined the complete waste of Westhusing 's life , as well as the similarly suspect scenario surrounding Pat Tilman 's death , both in some minor detail .
Much more information is available to anyone with time to burn and an Internet connection .
To realize , at this late date , the high probability of other brave , if misguided , young men seeing the same or similar fate if the Bu'Shite chickenhawks get their way is frankly disgusting .
To be clear , I do not lament Colonel Westhusing or Corporal Tillman because they were ' special ' per se , i.e. , different in any morally substantive way from the many other young men and women who have died similarly needless deaths .
I lament them because they are , quite unfortunately , not unique .
( One might be inclined to debate the explicit circumstances of both deaths , including but not limited to , who did the shooting , and how each man 's opinion of the war may or may not have effected his fate , but that is not the point of this essay . )
They are harbingers of just how far that waste can extend .
There are signs indicating that little has changed in the wake of these and many other wasted lives .
Two rather obvious points , made by many others , come almost immediately to my mind .
Firstly , the invasion of Iraq has been a failure , and a blind man could see it .
In fact , if aliens came to Earth on any given Wednesday and stopped by D.C. on their way to see the ' Seven Wonders , ' they would , by something like the following Friday , be asking , ' Say , how come y'all are still in this Iraq place ? '
( Aliens always have a Southern accent . )
The number and variety of people , from both sides of the aisle and all over the political spectrum , calling for a complete troop withdrawal is almost comical .
If President Bush and I were in a bar sharing a cordial drink ' something I reckon he 's done before , given his decision - making skills '
I 'd probably break it down to him with something like this : ' Dude , when William F. Buckley says the war is a failure , as he was saying in February of 2006 , it 's way past time to pack our bags , ummkay ? '
Yet , the White House seems uninterested in these notions .
Secondly , the continued insurgency in Iraq is composed , in large part , of people from one of our ' allies ' in the region .
U.S. officials now openly state that Saudis make up about half of the Sunni extremists who comprise the foreign fighters in Iraq .
Even better , many of them are suicide bombers .
The irony here is almost comical .
Given that most of the ' terrorists ' from 9/11 and very likely some of the money that funded those attacks ' the justification used by the Bu'Shites for the invasion of Iraq ' was also Saudi in origin , the U.S. probably had more reason to attack Saudi Arabia than Afghanistan .
Yet here the U.S. remains , mired in ' never ending war ' against one of Saudi Arabia 's chief rivals in the region .
The U.S. citizenry supplies the bodies and the money , and the Saudis ( among others ) get to oversee the spoils , in exchange for letting the U.S. leave even more people in the region to duck bullets if needed .
( These bullet - duckers inhabit areas called ' military bases . ')
Such a deal .
OK , so I 'm no military strategist , but it would seem , to the novice , the outsider , that innocent person with a pulse and an IQ just above a cumquat , that invading another country in the Persian Gulf would be a little , well , stupid .
This is particularly clear when one examines a few relevant facts , such as : a ) the U.S. has failed to achieve , by even the most modest measure , the bulk of the ( public ) pre-war goals for the Iraq invasion ; b ) the U.S. is pretty much out of bodies with which to supply the current war ; and c ) the U.S. citizenry is overwhelmingly against continuing in Iraq .
Unless there were some other , higher goals , some secret goals that were not publicly noted , I 'd say our leaders are batting close to zero with this particularly invasion .
Given this ' data , ' what does one of President Bush 's chief advisers suggest ?
Let 's invade Iran too .
What is going on here ?
Was there a two - for - one sale on war plans at the offices of the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) or something ?
For those who missed it , this is the think tank ( I use that term loosely ) that dreamed up the plan for regime change in Iraq back in 2000 or so .
The document that contained that plan , entitled ' Rebuilding American 's Defenses ' is a tour de force in hegemonic lunacy , laced with ample quantities of megalomaniacal hubris .
The actual plan the Administration followed , and many of its justifications , were taken from this document and others like it .
Even some libertarians , supposedly conversant in a philosophy that is categorically opposed to the initiation of violence , cannot seem to understand that invasions are not generally classifiable as ' self defense . '
The voices of reason , in direct opposition to those apparently stricken with 9/11 Derangement Syndrome , have been swift in their reasoned responses .
These warriors against illogic encourage me , and their numbers continue to swell , but I suspect the Bu'Shites wo n't care , even as their reign of terror draws to a close .
More depressing , I do n't think the message has reached the chief contenders for ' the big chair at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue ' like it should have by now .
One thing is clear , however : those who have the power of the U.S. Armed Forces at their disposal care little about logic and reason .
They 're just glad it 's not them ducking the bullets or coming back from some hellhole missing an arm or a leg .
Kill all you want , we 'll send more .
The Enablers of Lunacy
Despite my disgust for the ringleaders of this invade - a- county - every - week theatre of the absurd , there are others who are far from blame - free in this escapade .
The mainstream media ( MSM ) has bought into the pageantry for far too long .
The first problem , but nowhere near the last , is referring to what will happen if we leave Iraq as a ' civil war . '
A civil war is an armed conflict in which parties within the same culture , society or nationality fight against each other for the control of political power , all the political power of a geographic region .
This is not the case in Iraq .
The nationality , Iraqi , is artificial , created by interlopers , of which the U.S. is but one .
The cultures and beliefs involved are different enough that living together is almost destined to cause conflict , unless martial law and / or a despotic ruler are in place .
( Saddam Hussein was such a ruler .
Remember him ? )
The major groups who would undoubtedly battle for control of portions of Iraq ' the Shiites and the Sunnis , and to some extent the Kurds ' would , without external busybodies , very likely decide to live in separate countries , or at least with limited interaction .
They do n't want total political control .
They want to be left alone .
None of the groups in the region would be concerned , necessarily , with trying to control the land of the other .
As such , the term civil war is misplaced .
However , such a term does create the impression that the U.S. must not leave , lest all hell break loose .
Lost in that simplistic logic is the fact that the creation of the Iraq of today , for the benefit of external interests ' chief among them : a single state with which to negotiate for oil ' has led directly to this situation .
The solution is for those external interests to get the hell out and leave the inhabitants alone .
But no , that 's too easy .
The cries from the Bu'Shites remain fixed and stoic , much like an old picture of John Wayne 's jaw .
Kill all you want , we 'll send more .
History versus Fantasy
It is also relatively apparent that the propaganda of the Bu'Shites is built around a fantasy view of American history , and how likely it is that one could set up a ' stable , American - style democracy ' in the Persian Gulf .
It is clear that this outcome would benefit the U.S. , particularly given the huge oil reserves ' second largest in the world ' in Iraq , but such a choice as the kind of government under which they live is a decision for the residents of the region , not those who invade from afar .
( The fact that the U.S. chief ally in the region ' Saudi Arabia ' does not have a U.S. style democracy is another fascinating irony . )
From a historical standpoint , the dissimilarities between the war in Iraq and the American Revolutionary War are so large as to hopefully not require extensive analysis , but given the type of ' history ' and context available on places like Faux News , maybe a little review is warranted .
The people who fought the British during the American Revolution were trying to prevent or preclude further rule by the British .
The people fighting against the U.S. soldiers in Iraq ' known as ' insurgents ' ' are not trying to help Saddam Hussein , or anyone like him , re-ascend to the throne .
They simply want those who have invaded their land to leave .
( Wait .
That sounds familiar ! )
Most , if not all , of the people who fought during the American Revolution ' on both sides ' came , in large part from the same place , Great Britain specifically , and Europe more generally .
Almost no one fighting against the U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf came from Amerika !
The U.S. is , plainly , an invader , fighting and killing people its forces traveled a great distance to shoot , for no other purpose than because someone thought the guy in charge was a threat to , well , someone .
The fact that he was not , while hardly debatable , is no longer even that important , since he is , as best I can tell , dead .
( How much less of a threat can he become ? )
Yet the battle cries from ' The Decider ' ' and his band of idiots , of which John McCain seems to now be one ' remain unchanged .
Kill all you want , we 'll send more .
And The Beat Goes On
So the U.S. government continues to wage war in the region .
It continues to stay and kill more of the inhabitants , ostensibly until they adopt a manner of government that suits , well , the U.S. government .
( The fact that the U.S. government and its allies caused the deaths of up to 500,000 people , many of them children , in the region with our sanctions was apparently unsatisfying . )
If the roles were reversed , would anyone in the U.S. call those who took up arms against an invading army ' insurgents ' ?
Or would they be known as freedom fighters ?
Again , the irony is palpable .
Is it not implied by the very Constitution ( and related documents ) that every fighting man claims to defend that the right of self - determination is sacred ?
Why the hell is the U.S. in Iraq then ?
It certainly is n't because the U.S. government gives a crap about the Iraqis , a civil war it might leave in its wake , or any of that kind of rancid hog manure .
It 's quite simply because the ( ostensible ) leaders of the U.S. figure they would be better off if the Iraqis adopt the U.S. state - sponsored religion : the ' religion ' of democracy .
( Or so they say . )
Does anyone remember that saying about the pot calling the kettle black ?
When one examines what one is supposed to think the U.S. stands for and what the government 's actions abroad ' and domestically ' indicate , one gets the impression that the pot and kettle are a little closer than name - calling would indicate .
In fact , if the U.S. leaders ' rhetoric about freedom is the pot and those same people 's actions in the region we supposedly invaded to bring freedom is the kettle , I 'd say the pot and the kettle are pretty close friends now .
In fact , I 'd say the pot and kettle just had triplets .
Conclusion
At the end of my initial Westhusing column , I asked and answered a vital question :
So who killed Ted Westhusing ? '
We did .
Every person who displays a ' support the troops ' magnet on their car killed him .
Every person who stands around the water cooler ( or posts on ' the internets ' ) about the desperate need for Amerikan intervention to stop the spread of heinous ' Islamo - Fascists ' killed him .
Every school official who allows the U.S. military to recruit new killers - for - hire on school grounds killed him .
Every person who is not absolutely certain that a standing army has no purpose but aggression and imperialism killed him .
It seems pretty clear that every conceivable action in the Persian Gulf , except leaving , will lead to one inevitable result : more Ted Westhusings , more Pat Tillmans , and more people nowhere near as well - known who end up just as dead .
It also seems pretty clear that a more appropriate magnet would say something other than ' I support the troops . '
How about something like : ' Kill all you want , we 'll send more ' ?
And with all of King George 's horses and all of King George 's men , I do n't think we can put it back together again .
I am so sick of hearing how the surge is working because a small discreet part of Baghdad is overmanned militarily .
One word : Basra .
The Iraqi bloggers of Gorilla Guides are eyewitness to the devastation :
Parts of Basra were relatively quiet in the morning following the withdrawal of some fighters to the outskirts of the city however much of the city is seeing intensifying armed clashes .
Eyewitness reports say that groups of Mahdi Army withdrew to the outskirts of the city after GZG forces backed by British tanks and US warplanes tried to eradicate them from areas that are strongholds of the Mahdi Army .
Some witnesses confirmed that a group of the Mahdi Army captured two vehicles belonging to the GZG army type there are reliable reports that GZG barracks have been overrun .
One of our members in the city says that withdrawals appear to have been planned long before as part of a defense in depth strategy .
Our members and contacts in city say that there is still a lot fighting going on .
They also say that reports in the British media that british troops and aircraft are not involved in the fighting is a flat out lie and that British tanks are heavily involved . .
Udpate : [ sic ]
The American war criminal Bush whose death squad in uniform called the U.S. armed forces are still trying to subjugate Irak and who have murdered innumerable Iraki Children women and men calls the carnage a " positive moment " you can read what he has to say for himself to the UK Times newspaper here .
Tahseen al - Sheikhli one of the two main spokesmen for the " surge " was unavailable for comment because he has been kidnapped .
I considered editing the post to remove the reference to George Bush , but honestly , can you blame them for their characterization ?
These people do not think of American forces as liberators , no matter how many times that 's repeated on American TV .
There is too much and it is too difficult in this blog format to list all the reports of carnage , chaos and destruction , so click on the " Basra " link for multiple reports that shame all the media spin about the surge 's success , including the heart breaking report that the 9 year old brother of one of the bloggers passed away yesterday as a result of burns he received during an airstrike .
His brother , Mohammed , author of this heartbreaking poem , already the victim of so much violence , survived being shot at while trying to carry his brother to the hospital .

Refugee camps almost by definition have limited visibility .
Often located in places that are hot , flooded , or at war , such camps go unseen by most of the world except for the occasional crisis segment on the evening news .
Now , the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) hopes to give more visibility to the work that it does in such camps around the world , bringing the reality of refugee life into the laptops and living rooms of web surfers thanks to the power of Google mapping tools .
Google and the UNHCR talked up a partnership in which Google provides the pro version of its Google Earth software , its Sketchup 3D software for creating objects and structures , and extensive documentation on how to use the system to create a .
KML layer .
The result is a ( hopefully ) informative overlay that works with both Google Earth and Google Maps to tell visual stories .
The UNHCR overlay has three levels of detail , moving from the big picture to the birds - eye .
The first layer provides a UNHCR tour and shows the group 's work in major operations in Darfur / Chad , Iraq , and Colombia .
The second layer illustrates the refugee experience and links to specific camps .
The third and most " macroscopic " layer shows an individual camp layout , complete with water storage bladders ( see picture below ) .
UNHCR staffers waxed eloquent about how the power of easy - to - use mapping can aid their work .
" In the deserts and jungles where humanitarian operations take place , access to maps and web resources such as Google Earth will become as normal for our operations ' managers as using a compass or a satellite phone , " said Karl Steinacker , who heads the UNHCR Field Information & Coordination Support Section .
But the project seems most likely to revolutionize refugee work , if it does so at all , by graphically illustrating the location and realities of the camps to populations that have little firsthand experience of UNHCR 's work .
Francoise Jaccoud , a public information officer at UNHCR , summed up this possibility when he said , " The impact of Google Earth is limited only by our imagination and it can , indeed , dramatically reduce the distance between refugees and the public . "
UNHCR is n't the only agency using Google Earth to foster awareness of serious problems .
Just yesterday , Michael Graham of the Genocide Prevention Mapping Initiative at the US Holocaust Museum launched a new layer called " World is Witness " that will be used as a " geoblog . "
The layer will be updated with posts about places in countries like Rwanda and the Congo , showing people 's stories using the power of maps and photos .
As for Google , it 's trying to get its tools in the hand of more aid agencies and humanitarian groups , confident that the power of this new way of telling stories will prove a good fit with groups looking to highlight global issues in lesser - known places .
But creating and maintaining the mapping data is n't a simple matter , as a Google blog post today makes clear .
In a lengthy but fascinating entry , Google 's Andrew McLaughlin described just how complicated it is for Google to do something as seemingly simple as determine names for every body of water used in its maps .
What to do , for instance , when a patch of water is called " Sea of Japan " in one country ( guess which one ) and " East Sea " in another ?
Google certainly has an incredible resource on its hands .
Microsoft , despite the presence of slick features like the scarily - sharp " bird 's eye " view on its Live Search Maps , stands to lose out on being the de facto source for mapping overlays if Google continues to gain mindshare , though Microsoft did introduce rudimentary support for .
KML overlays late last year .
If it hopes to prevent Google from becoming the YouTube of mapping , it may need to act even more quickly .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Navy has temporarily added a second aircraft carrier in the Gulf as a “ reminder ” to Iran , but this was not an escalation of American forces in the region , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Tuesday .

The U.S. Navy has temporarily added a second aircraft carrier in the Gulf as a " reminder " to Iran , but this was not an escalation of American forces in the region , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Tuesday .

Speaking to reporters during a trip to Mexico , Gates flatly denied a suggestion that the presence of two U.S. carriers in the Gulf could be a precursor to military action against Tehran .
“ This deployment has been planned for a long time , ” Gates said .
“ I do n’t think we ’ll have two carriers there for a protracted period of time .
So I do n’t see it as an escalation .
I think it could be seen , though , as a reminder . ”
He declined to elaborate on his remarks and provided no details about the deployment .
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said the second carrier arrived in the Gulf on Tuesday to replace one on duty that was expected to depart the region in two days .
U.S. Navy officials were not immediately available for comment .
News of the second carrier came amid simmering tension between the United States and Iran that has fed speculation about a possible U.S. military strike .
Navy Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , said last week that the Pentagon had military options it could consider against Tehran but stressed that the United States would continue to rely on diplomatic and economic methods to address its concerns .
Iran and the United States have repeatedly clashed over U.S. claims that Tehran is pursuing nuclear arms and aiding Shi’ite militants in Iraq who have recently stepped up attacks on U.S. - led coalition forces .
Tehran maintains it is pursuing a civilian nuclear energy program and blames violence in Iraq on the presence of about 160,000 U.S. forces .
There have also been confrontations between U.S. ships and small boats in the region , including vessels the Pentagon has described as Iranian craft .
Last week , a cargo ship hired by the U.S. military fired warning shots in the Gulf at two unidentified boats that approached the U.S. vessel while ignoring radio communications and a warning flare .
The boats left the area after what the Navy described as “ a few bursts ” of machine gun fire .

This exhibits them in still more odious colors .
It manifests a desire on the part of their society , to inflict on our society an injury that they know would be to us entirely insupportable , and one of the surest means of driving us from the country ; for it would require none of the supernatural gifts that they pretend to , to see that the introduction of such a caste among us would corrupt our blacks , and instigate them to bloodshed . ” ” … we believe it a duty we owe to ourselves , our wives , and children , to the cause of public morals , to remove them from among us , as we are not prepared to give up our pleasant places and goodly possessions to them or to receive into the bosom of our families , as fit companions for wives and daughters , the degraded and corrupted free Negroes and mulattos that are now invited to settle among us . ” ” … we agree to use such means as may be sufficient to remove them , and to that and we each pledge to each other are bodily powers , our lives , fortunes and sacred honors . ”

Coltrin is working from an old memory and makes several factual errors .

They should be equal to ‘ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . ’
They should be equal in the matter of education .
They should not be barred from obtaining knowledge and becoming proficient in any field of science , art or mechanical occupation .
They should be free to choose any kind of employment , to go into business in any field they may choose and to make their lives as happy as it is possible without interference from white men , labor unions or from any other source .
In their defense of these privileges the members of the Church will stand . ” ( Answers to Gospel Questions 2:185 )

“ During recent months , both in Salt Lake City and across the nation , considerable interest has been expressed in the position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints on the matter of civil rights .
We would like it to be known that there is in this Church no doctrine , belief , or practice that is intended to deny the enjoyment of full civil rights by any person regardless of race , color , or creed .
“ We say again , as we have said many times before , that we believe that all men are the children of the same God and that it is a moral evil for any person or group of persons to deny any human being the rights to gainful employment , to full educational opportunity , and to every privilege of citizenship , just as it is a moral evil to deny him the right to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience .
“ We have consistently and persistently upheld the Constitution of the United States , and as far as we are concerned this means upholding the constitutional rights of every citizen of the United States .
“ We call upon all men everywhere , both within and outside the Church , to commit themselves to the establishment of full civil equality for all of God ’s children .

State 's top court strikes down marriage ban Short - lived victory ?
November vote could write ban on same - sex marriage into state Constitution
The California Supreme Court struck a historic but possibly short - lived blow for gay rights Thursday , overturning a state law that allowed only opposite - sex couples to marry .
In a 4 - 3 ruling that elicited passionate responses on both sides of the debate and touched off celebrations at San Francisco City Hall - the scene of nearly 4,000 same - sex weddings four years ago that were invalidated months later - the court said the right to marry in California extends equally to all , gay and straight alike .
The state Constitution 's guarantees of personal privacy and autonomy protect " the right of an individual to establish a legally recognized family with the person of one 's choice , " said Chief Justice Ronald George , who wrote the 121 - page majority opinion .
He said the Constitution " properly must be interpreted to guarantee this basic civil right to all Californians , whether gay or heterosexual , and to same - sex couples as well as opposite - sex couples . "
The conflict over same - sex marriage , in which public opinion and tradition are aligned against a minority group , is similar to the controversy the court confronted 60 years ago when it became the first in the nation to overturn a state ban on interracial marriage , George said .
Dissenters said the court had interfered with the democratic process and overstepped its bounds .

He said a future " activist court " might invoke the ruling to legalize polygamous and incestuous marriages - a comparison rejected by George , who said the state has ample justifications to ban those marriages because of their harmful effect on families .
The high court - with a 6 - 1 majority of Republican appointees , including George - is the second in the nation after Massachusetts ' to declare a right of same - sex couples to marry .
It is the first high court to rule that the state 's Constitution forbids all discrimination based on sexual orientation with the same strict type of prohibition that applies to bias based on race , sex or religion .
But in the debate over same - sex marriage , the voters are likely to have the last word .
Anticipating the possibility of Thursday 's ruling , conservative religious groups have submitted more than 1.1 million signatures on petitions for an initiative that would enshrine the ban on same - sex marriage as a state constitutional amendment .
That ban was first put in place as a law by the Legislature in 1977 and was reaffirmed by voters in 2000 as a ballot initiative .
The constitutional amendment will qualify for the November ballot if officials determine that at least 694,354 of the signatures are valid , a decision due by mid-June .
Majority approval needed
The amendment would need majority approval from voters to pass .
It would overturn Thursday 's ruling on the right to marry , although the section of the decision banning discrimination based on sexual orientation would remain in place .
The initiative does not say whether it would apply retroactively to annul marriages performed before November , an omission that would wind up before the courts .
Lawyers for the Campaign for California Families , which opposes same - sex marriage , hope to prevent that situation by asking the court to put its ruling on hold until the election .
If the court refuses to do so , the ruling will take effect in 30 days - on Saturday , June 14 .
" This decision will ignite California voters to amend their state Constitution to protect marriage and prevent judges from wrecking marriage , " said Mathew Staver , founder and chief lawyer at Liberty Counsel , which represents the Campaign for California Families .
Voters in at least 20 states have approved such amendments .
The 2000 California initiative passed with 61 percent of the vote , but it was not a constitutional amendment .
Advocates hope for better
Gay - rights groups are hopeful that climate is changing , citing statewide opinion polls that have shown increased support , though less than a majority , for same - sex marriage rights .
They also are counting on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who reiterated his opposition Thursday to a constitutional amendment that would overrule the court 's decision .
Citing the ballot initiative approved eight years ago , Schwarzenegger vetoed bills in 2005 and 2007 that sought to legalize same - sex marriage .
The bills were in response to the court 's August 2004 ruling annulling the weddings that San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom had authorized six months earlier .
The annulments were not affected by Thursday 's ruling .
The mayor said he issued his order because he doubted the constitutionality of the state marriage law .
While the court ruled that Newsom lacked authority to act , it did not rule on the validity of the law itself and said it would await proceedings in lower courts .
On Thursday , the court agreed with Schwarzenegger 's assessment of the 2000 ballot measure and said it barred the Legislature from broadening marriage rights to same - sex couples without a vote of the people .
Marriage as institution
But the court majority rejected an array of legal justifications for excluding gays and lesbians from marriage , including religious conservatives ' argument that same - sex matrimony would alter the definition of marriage and weaken the institution .
Allowing same - sex couples to marry " will not deprive opposite - sex couples of any rights and will not alter the legal framework of the institution of marriage , " George said .
Addressing the same groups ' related argument that marriage should be reserved for couples who can procreate , George said the right to marry " has never been limited to those who plan or desire to have children . "
The chief argument offered in defense of the law by state Attorney General Jerry Brown and Schwarzenegger , who was represented separately , was that California is entitled to maintain a traditional definition of marriage while extending equality to gays and lesbians in every area of the law .
They cited state laws that provide marital benefits such as inheritance , hospital visitation , community property and child support to registered domestic partners , most of them same - sex couples .
The state is unable to provide federal marital benefits , such as joint federal income tax filing and Social Security survivors ' rights , because those are governed by federal law .
A California appeals court agreed with that argument in 2006 , but the state 's high court said domestic partner laws kept gay and lesbian couples in a separate and lesser status .
Marriage is special
Marriage , George said , is not just a bundle of rights , but is a relationship uniquely honored by the state and society .
Confining same - sex couples to a different category marks them with " second - class citizenship , " the chief justice said .
As for the argument that marriage has historically been reserved for a man and a woman , George said that even the most widely accepted traditions " often mask an unfairness and inequality " that only the victims understand .
Dissenting justices said the courts should leave the definition of marriage to state lawmakers , who have substantial reasons - historic tradition and the will of the people - to preserve the status quo .
The majority " does not have the right to erase , then recast , the age - old definition of marriage , as virtually all societies have understood it , in order to satisfy its own contemporary notions of equality and justice , " said Baxter , joined by Justice Ming Chin .
Noting the recent success of gay - rights groups in passing laws and winning public support , Baxter said they might soon have won marital rights through " the ordinary democratic process . "
Those same developments , Baxter said , contradict the majority 's unprecedented conclusion that gays and lesbians need the same constitutional protection from discrimination as racial and religious minorities .
Justice Carol Corrigan , Schwarzenegger 's sole appointee to the court , said in a separate dissent that she personally believes " Californians should allow our gay and lesbian neighbors to call their unions marriages . "
But she said public opinion is to the contrary , at least for now , and should be allowed to run its course .
" When ideas are imposed , " Corrigan said , " opposition hardens and progress may be hampered . "
The power of play on the internet
By Maggie Shiels
Technology reporter , BBC News , San Francisco
New sites combine the idea of gaming and social networks Game design and social networks are merging into one of the most persuasive forces on the net .
That assertion was made by a string of speakers at the Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco .
" Social networking is a game in and of itself , " explained Jennifer Pahlka , co-chair of the conference .
She highlighted networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn that make public the number of friends a person has , posts how well a user does on certain applications and displays what level they are at .
" There are all these game dynamics built into the social web , " said Ms Pahlka .
" So the idea that there is a game market here and a web market here is n't true .
The two are influencing each other . "
Perhaps the greatest effect of that interplay can be seen in the rise and rise of the social gamer .
Recent figures by research firm Park Associates estimates that 34 % of US adult internet users play online games weekly .
The moment you make the gaming more personal and meaningful , the better the experience for the user
Guy Ben-Artzi
Those figures present opportunities to developers and social networking sites alike .
For example MySpace has just announced the public launch of its " applications gallery " at Web 2.0 .
Central to those applications will be games .
Steve Pearman of the firm told BBC News : " This will take what you can do inside a social network to a new level .
If you can provide something cool for my users I will be happy . "
Meaningful play
One duo who believe they have a cool application that will appeal to the growing social gaming community are Galia and Guy Ben-Artzi .
The Ben-Artzi's are a brother and sister behind a start up called Mytopia , which they describe as a social gaming community where everyone can play together .
It offers everything from chess to Sudoku and hearts to poker which you can play directly from their site or via Facebook , MySpace , Hi5 and Bebo .
By applying these gaming principles it helps build these thriving successful communities
Lyle Fong
" Social networks offer a revolutionary way for people to play with friends and communities that have meaningful value to them in their real life , " said Guy Ben - Artzi , who confesses he used to be a gamer who would do anything to win .
" The moment you make the gaming more personal and meaningful , the better the experience for the user , " he added .
" The ability to play with the people I care about and connect with them is what is appealing to me , " explained Galia , who is a fan of Suduko and plays online with her mother .
" Logging in and playing with strangers was exciting when the internet was new but the modern web is personal and social and it is clear that the internet is being used for social purposes to connect people rather than isolate them . "
Gaming principles
One hardcore gamer said the shift to social gaming was inevitable as Web 2.0 flourished .
Lyle Fong and his brother Denis , who once won a Ferrari in a gaming competition , were serious players who also set up Gamers.com as an online community for like - minded people .
He is now the CEO of Lithium Technologies , which makes software for companies such as Dell , AT&T , Sony PlayStation and Nokia using gaming principles .
" We build up these reputation systems with levels and rankings just as you would if it was a game and by applying these gaming principles it helps build these thriving successful communities . "
As he eschews his hardcore background , Mr Fong admits that social gaming is here to stay and will only continue to grow for obvious reasons .
" If you look at these sites like Facebook and Linked In you can post notes and chat and swap photos but that 's not very engaging .
Social gaming makes it fun and that 's really very neat . "

Duncan Meerding By
In May and June 1968 , a movement erupted in France that threatened not just the survival of the government of President Charles De Gaulle but the system that it represented — capitalism .
At the height of this movement , which was sparked by radical action by youth and students , an estimated 10 million workers were on strike and 600,000 students were occupying their schools and universities , and a further 2 million farmers were supporting them .
This meant that more than one in five of France ’s population were on the streets during this time .
The reason for the defeat of the revolution needs to be studied .
The revolt occurred in a context of rising struggles across the globe .
In January 1968 , the Vietnamese National Liberation Front ( NLF ) launched its massive Tet Offensive against the US occupation forces , which stunned the occupiers and proved to the world the futility of US imperialism ’s attempts to subjugate the Vietnamese people .
At one point , the liberation fighters occupied the US embassy .
The US response to the NLF ’s attack was horrendous — including the mass bombardment and subsequent destruction of the ancient Vietnamese capital , Hue .
The Vietnam War had a radicalising role on people around the world , especially young people .
The US , and the ``liberal democratic ’’ capitalist system it represented , was espousing freedom while carrying out a war that by its end had killed at least 3 million Vietnamese people .
The examples of French colonialism , especially in Vietnam until 1954 and more recently in Algeria — which France was finally forced to relinquish control of in 1962 following a brutal war — also played a role in the radicalisation of ordinary French people , most notably the students .
Student revolt
It was the actions of the students , against a background of a worldwide youth radicalisation that triggered the events of May - June 1968 , which took France to the brink of revolution .
Sparked by seemingly small concerns at first , soon the struggles tapped deep - seated discontent .
Paris , May 1968
More graphic videos of May - June 1968 here and here .
On February 21 , Paris witnessed the first mass university and high school student demonstration in response to poor conditions in overcrowded universities .
The demonstrators renamed the area of Paris known as the Latin Quarter as ``The Heroic Vietnam Quarter ’’ .
The repression meted out by police led to further protests .
This led to the formation of the March 22nd Movement , taking its name from the March 22 protest against the arrest of leaders of an antiwar rally .
This group led the occupation of the Nanterre University campus , with the university radio station being taken over .
The campus , which was synonymous with the term ``concrete jungle ’’ , was shut down by the authorities for two days , with the university authorities calling police to deal with student radicals .
A further series of protests addressed a range of student concerns , from conditions on campus , to the war in Vietnam and brutal police repression .
The campus was established in the middle of the working - class outer suburbs , where the immigrants from Algeria were more prevalent .
This expanded the minds of the students who went there .
A May 7 protest involved 20,000 high school and university students demanding the freeing of arrested students and the re-opening of both the Sorbonne and Nanterre university campuses , which had been closed by university authorities to try to quell the rise in popularity of the radical student activists .
The two universities remained closed and on May 9 the students met en masse in the streets of the Latin Quarter and decided to protest the next day .
The May 10 protest involved 35,000 students .
They voted to go to Sante prison , where arrested students were being held , and to stop at the education ministry to demand the reopening of the universities .
The protest did not get to the education ministry , instead the students were herded into and trapped in the Latin Quarter by police .
The students responded by erecting barricades .
The police did not think that the ``spoiled ’’ students would last the night , and took bets as to when the students would ask to go home .
However , the students refused to budge and the authorities made the mistake of using the Republican Security Companies ( CRS ) to brutally attack and tear gas the students .
For the French people , the CRS was not an impartial force — it had a long history as being used as strike breakers .
By using the CRS , the government showed its intention of seeking to smash the student protests .
At 2.40 am on May 11 , the CRS launched its attack , with tear gas and smoke bombs .
The students quelled the effects of the gas with goggles and rags soaked in water , supplied by the local residents .
The tear gas and smoke bombs were not enough to break the frontlines of the barricades of students and from 3 am till 8 am , police used chlorine gas to break up the protesters , in combination with sending in riot police , the CRS being on the frontline of this .
According to historian Charles Sowerwine , in his 2002 book France Since 1870 , ``460 people were arrested , 367 seriously wounded ’’.
This figure could have been higher , as some students , fearing reprisals , sought treatment from fellow medical students , rather than go to the hospitals .
The police denied allegations they had used chlorine gas on the protesters , but the hospital where the students were treated reported chlorine poisoning .
A reporter at the scene who asked if police were using chlorine gas was knocked out by the cops
By the time police crashed through the barricades on May 11 , they found not just students but local residents angrily demanding : `` Is this any way to treat our youngsters ? ’’
The night of May 10 - 11 , 1968 , became known as the ``Night of the Barricades ’’ .
These events galvanised public support for the students .
The audacity and courage of the students in struggling for just demands against the anti-worker CRS caught the French people ’s imagination .
The revolt spreads
After initially condemning the students — denouncing them as ``adventurers ’’ , ``anarchists ’’ and ``Trotskyites ’’ — the French Communist Party ( PCF ) , then a mass party that controlled much of the trade union movement , voted in favour of a resolution in solidarity with the students .
Prime Minister Georges Pompidou made a speech on May 11 conceding to the demand to reopen the universities and implied the government would release arrested students .
However , by this stage the student movement had gained confidence and momentum — as well as the support of large sections of the working class .
On May 13 , workers went on strike and up to 1 million people marched in Paris in support of the students , with demonstrations occurring across France .
On May 14 , the revolt took a further turn with workers at an aviation factory occupying the factory .
On May 15 , the workers at Renault also took over their factory ; by May 21 almost every section of the French economy was on strike .
Responding to the role of the students in sparking a wider rebellion against the government , President De Gaulle referred to the students as cette chienlit ( ``this shit in the bed ’’ ) .
The students occupying the Ecole des Beaux Arts responded by putting out an iconic poster picturing a silhouette of De Gaulle with their response : La chienlit c’est lui !
( `` He is the shit in the bed ! ’’ ) .
The movement that erupted was increasingly taking on broad support , both in the breadth of the population being drawn into it and the degree of its radicalisation — the insistence that a better world was possible .
The situation was rapidly developing into a revolutionary situation that could overthrow the regime .
French workers had been involved in strikes through out the ’60s , but nothing on the scale reached during May and June 1968 .
The power of the working class was imposing itself on French society .
Nothing moved unless the working class wanted it to .
A desperate government sought to host a referendum to attempt to defuse the situation , and channel the discontent back into safer , more passive electoral channels — however French workers refused to print the ballots .
The government tried to get them printed in Belgium , but Belgian workers refused in solidarity .
Journalists and TV technicians refused to broadcast government propaganda .
A more powerful democracy was emerging on the streets — mass action of working people and students , beginning to take over the running of society in the occupied universities and factories .
In some parts of France , strike committees were more or less in total control .
De Gaulle was forced into hiding .
He secretly went to French troops stationed in Baden - Baden in Germany .
He asked them : `` If Paris falls , will you help me to retake it ? ’’
He got a commitment to do this from the top brass , in return for an assurance that the leaders of the Algerian ( right - wing ) coup would be released .
De Gaulle , agreed to this , but the French troops stationed in Germany being never used to defeat of the strikers .
On June 15 , De Gaulle used the events 1968 to release 50 members of the Secret Army Organisation ( OAS ) far - right troops who had participated in the Algerian coup .
Role of PCF
However , while the revolt shook the foundations of the system , it failed to overthrow it .
The movement slowly lost momentum and the government took the initiative to organise elections for June .
The strike movement came to an end , with the workers winning significant gains , but the fundamental situation remained unchanged .
A significant factor in saving the system was the role of the PCF .
The PCF sought to distance itself from the student revolt at the time of the Night of the Barricades , and the subsequent May 13 general strike was called by the PCF - controlled General Confederation of Labour ( CGT ) due to pressure from below .
Although at the height of the revolt , the working class was moving beyond the pro-capitalist , reformist politics of the PCF , the student - based groups that led the movement ’s anti-capitalist trajectory and were leading the student revolt were too new and lacked a working - class base .
The PCF had been dragged into the revolt kicking and screaming .
Rather than seeking to lead the movement in a revolutionary direction , it manoeuvred throughout to attempt to limit the struggle of the workers to seeking reforms within the existing system .
When the regime sought to consolidate itself in June , the PCF worked to convince workers to end the strikes and the occupations of the factories , in preparation for the June election organised by the De Gaulle regime as the way out of the crisis .
The PCF fully supported the election and even ran on a ``law and order ’’ platform .
A different way forward could have been for the CGT to encourage and organise the election of strike councils and democratic mass meetings , as was occurring in the occupied universities , and to seek to coordinate elected delegates nationally to pose an alternative to the existing regime .
However , the PCF was afraid of losing its control over the situation .
In the Russian Revolution of 1917 , the Bolshevik Party was not afraid of losing control of the movement .
At one point it was a minority in the Soviets ( workers ’ and peasants ’ councils ) , yet called for ``All power to the soviets ! ’’
If the PCF had maintained the pressure , leading up to the June election and had maintained the political pressure , the character of post - 1968 France would have been different .
The movement which erupted in 1968 was a movement that challenged the capitalist government and was motivated by opposition to the inadequacies and inequities of capitalism .
If the PCF had , rather than stifling the movement , tried to build it , before and after the election of the new government – whatever party took office – that government would have had to make its decisions under the mass pressure of a powerful , mobilised popular movement .
With the mass revolt dying down , and with no clear alternative on the left ( not only had the PCF refused to provide a lead to the growing anti-capitalist sentiment , the revolutionary groups that did were outlawed and banned from running ) in June De Gaulle ’s right - wing Gaullist Union for the Defence of the Republic increased its vote to win a parliamentary majority .
However , the revolt had fatally wounded De Gaulle ’s reign , and he stepped down less than one year later — Pompidou having already resigned as PM in July 1968 .
Role of the JCR
The void left by the PCF , in terms of the absence of a mass revolutionary party , was large .
The events of May - June 1968 may have looked quite different if there had been a revolutionary party capable of initiating action , one which saw the power on the streets and called for an overthrow of the existing order , not for waiting for the ballot box .
There were formations that did play this role , but none with a mass base .
One such organisation , the Revolutionary Communist Youth ( JCR ) , did initiate action and was at the forefront of the revolt , at the beginning of the movement and at the end .
Apart from lacking a working - class base , the organisation was relatively young .
It had only formed two years prior to the May revolt , in April 1966 .
In the autumn 1965 , a number of the militants with in the Union of Communist Students ( UEC ) did not support the left - capitalist politician François Mitterrand in the general election , and they were expelled from the organisation .
These students formed the JCR , which by the time of the May 1968 revolt had between 600 and 700 highly political radical members , inspired by the Vietnamese and Cuban revolutions .
While the JCR was small in comparison to the PCF , it had a large impact during the May - June events .
The JCR was the dominant political tendency in the Union National des Etudiants Français ( UNEF – the National French Student Association ) .
During the events of May , almost every day the major newspapers mentioned the JCR .
This was partly due to the fact that the JCR had launched itself straight into the rising student movement .
While the CGT was calling off the strike through the July days , the JCR , through its leadership of the UNEF , was calling more protests and continuing to try to fuel the mass movement and overthrow bourgeois order .
The students only made up a minority and lacked the ability , as the workers did , to bring the economy to a standstill .
After waiting for the CGT and other mass - based unions to organise a protest against the suspension of the parliament and De Gaulle ’s open threat of military dictatorship , the JCR decided to initiate action .
After De Gaulle ’s May 30 speech , on June 1 the JCR organised a protest of 30,000 students .
The PCF - led CGT instructed its members to stay away .
The protesters sung the Internationale – the song of the communist movement , reflecting the mood of the students .
The JCR grew during the revolt , doubling its membership in Paris .
This was a reflection of the political popularity of the JCR due to its leading role in the revolt , giving it a hearing among many young people and students .
` Death of May ‘ 68 ’ ?
In 2008 , President Nicolas Sarkozy came to power saying , ``My victory shows the death of May ’ 68 and that legacy in France , and I will destroy it forever . ’’
Is this true ?
Sarkozy ’s France has seen a range of actions against the conservative agenda that he represents .
Sarkozy ’s popularity is at an all time low , lower even than that of his predecessor Chirac .
Forty years on , the struggle is continuing — this time against Sarkozy ’s government .
Last year , a mass movement of students and workers forced the government to withdraw a particularly nasty anti-worker law , and this year has already seen strikes and student protests .
In a poll taken in 2005 by the Globe Scan institute , only 36 % of the French people agreed with the claim , ``the free enterprise system and free market economy is the best system on which to base the future of the world . ’’
Sarkozy must not have seen these results .
Forty years after May - June , socialist commentator and 1968 participant Tariq Ali pointed out that the government which came after De Gaulle and Pompidou actually made a lot of concessions in terms of wages , working conditions and the conditions inside universities .
So , in order to prevent revolution , it acceded to a number of the workers ’ and students ’ demands .
He pointed out that the 1968 movement won the French working class a relatively high standard of living , and a number of the large movements have developed in response to attacks on those rights .
Birth of the LCR
After the events of May 1968 , the parties to the left of the PCF were banned by the De Gaulle regime .
This subsequently meant that the JCR was dissolved , but reformed as the Communist League ( 1969 ) and then later as the Revolutionary Communist League ( LCR ) .
As both the Socialist Party ( social democratic ) and Communist parties placed a priority on preserving the bourgeois order , the need for such an organisation was vital for advancing the struggle for socialism in France .
The May - June 1968 revolt shook the foundations of French society .
The LCR was born out of a key lesson learned from the revolt : that there needs to be a revolutionary party that is open and spirited in the tradition of the Bolshevik Party , one that is not afraid of leading movements which it may not necessarily ``control ’’ .
In last May ’s presidential election , the LCR ’s Olivier Besancenot polled 4.1 % of the vote in the in the face of a concerted effort by other left groups to throw their weight behind the Socialist Party candidate .
The 34 - year - old postal worker is the spokesperson for a left movement deeply rooted in the traditions of 1968 .
An IFOP poll in November 2007 found that Besancenot would receive 7 % in a presidential election .
In the same poll , the figure climbed to 12 % for people born between 1977 and 1982 .
The fact that a party with its origins in the 1968 revolt is still so prominent goes to show that Sarkozy is dead wrong when stating that the legacy of May - June 1968 is dead .
A range of young people are joining the organisation , which champions a multitude of movements for democratic change and equality ; from the feminist , to the environmental and the global justice movements .
While a number of its policies are highly popular among the French people , the LCR has not shied away from addressing the immigrant rights struggle , even to the detriment of immediately winning sections of the working class over .
As Besancenot told Marc Perelman in the May 29 , 2008 , US Nation – in an article titled ``Letter From Lille : Echoes of ' 68 ’’ -- ``a leftist does n't hesitate when it comes to defending the disenfranchised ’’.
The LCR has doubled its membership since 2002 .
With the growth in the ranks of the LCR mainly being among young people , the LCR has also seen an increase in its membership from people from a working - class background .
This is in contrast to the aging ranks of the PCF and the increasingly non-working - class composition of the Socialist Party .
The spirit of 1968 has not been extinguished .
As long as the workers and students of France continue their struggles , and continue to grow in confidence , the spirit of May - June 1968 is alive and well .
The next time a May 1968 situation arises , the workers and students may be successful in revolution .
If the LCR is , through its new left party project , firmly based in the working class , is democratic and not afraid to fight the capitalist system , Sarkozy and his ilk may be forced to eat their words .

WINDPOWER 2008 : Nordex to Build US Production Facility
June 4th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
Houston , TX – Another large wind turbine manufacturer has decided to get in on the incredible growth in the U.S. wind energy industry by building a new manufacturing facility .
The German company Nordex , announced Tuesday at WINDPOWER 2008 ** that it will be spending around $ 100 million over the next few years to establish its own U.S. production facilities for turbines and blades .
As early as 2009 , the first locally produced 2.5 MW N80/90 wind turbines will be entering the US market .
The investment will be spent on establishing annual production capacity of 750 megawatts by 2012 .
As of 2010 , Nordex wants to invest two thirds of this sum in rotor blade production .
Roughly 600 jobs will be created at the new production facility .
On Wednesday , I had the opportunity to sit down with company founder Carsten Pederson for a couple of minutes to talk about the new U.S. manufacturing facility and what effect a lapse in the federal renewable energy production tax credit ( PTC ) might have on the wind energy industry .
He jokingly agreed to chat with me under the conditions that I did n’t ask him tough questions like where exactly the new facility would be located ( presumably because they have n’t finalized the deal yet ) .
Considering wind energy was the second largest source of new electricity on the U.S. electrical grid in 2007 , it is not hard to understand why Nordex wants to move ahead with a U.S. production facility .
Of more interest to me is what Mr. Pederson felt about the possible lapse in the PTC , and whether it could cause the booming wind energy industry to sag at a very critical juncture .
Like most of the 13,000 conference attendees , Pederson would prefer a long term extension of the tax credit , but he also told me that they were moving ahead with construction plans in spite of the uncertain future of the policy mechanism .
“ Politicians should extend the PTC for a few years , now .
What we need is a stable long - term policy , ” said Pederson , adding that there might be a dip in the “ very short term ” if it is left to expire , but that projected long - term increases increases in electricity demand , and the increase in state - level incentives and renewable portfolio standards would continue to make wind economically viable and politically expedient , with or without the PTC .
Pederson also mentioned that the U.S. was not so different from Europe , in that strong political pressure is bubbling up from the grassroots for more renewable energy , but that politicians feel more comfortable saying they support renewable energy , than actually enacting legislation doing so .

Priceless treasure guide disguised as the confused ramblings of a misanthropic iconoclast .
Seeking the next level is not a quest for the timid , not for the easily discouraged .
When it comes to toilets , there 's a simple directional rule : everything goes downstream .
When things move against the tide , then you have problems .
So as Tim Fraser was doing some laundry in his bathroom last Friday night , he became a wee bit disturbed when his toilet started spontaneously gurgling .
" I could see bubbles coming up and I thought ' what the the hell is happening ? ' " he said , recalling that evening .
Then he caught sight of a grey , furry head with a pair of pointy ears and saucepan eyes emerging on this side of the s-bend .
Moments later there was a half - drowned possum sitting in his Fowler toilet bowl .
" It was like the toilet had given birth , " he said .
It 's not clear who was more startled , man or marsupial .
But Fraser was first to react .
He darted to the next room and collected his digital camera .
As he began filming , he dialled a plumber friend who lived nearby and asked him to come over and lend a hand in the rescue .
Fraser , 39 , lives just north of the Brisbane CBD in an area near a large colony of the creatures .
So he 's used to crossing paths with possums , but never quite like this before .
It quickly dawned on him that the only way the critter could have climbed in was through a 100 mm - wide breather pipe for the toilet line .
This runs from the roof of his house , down the back wall before joining the sewage pipe at basement level and turning back up to the toilet - a distance of over 10 metres .
The final leg of the possum 's fantastic voyage would have involved wriggling through the s- bend - a set - up that creates a water - filled seal between flushings .
" He was close to death and lucky that no one had used the toilet recently , " Fraser said , adding that he let the possum settle and catch its breath before helping it out of the bowl .
Once clear of its porcelain prison , the possum made a dash for freedom .
Hissing and snarling at its rescuers , it eventually bolted through an open door and back into its suburban habitat .
Fraser , who likes to tinker with computers and knows his way around the internet , then uploaded four short clips of the possum on to YouTube so he could share it with the world .
It 's more evidence that what used to known as a Kodak moment has now become a YouTube one .
Surprisingly , the videos - Possum Climbs up through Pipe to Toilet - have not taken off , each only collecting a few hundred views .
But with the internet being the echo chamber it is , everything is eventually noticed by someone , somewhere .
Arjun Ramachandran writes : According to Nigel Williamson , from Nigel 's Animal Rescue , possums have a habit of getting themselves into trouble .
" Every day of the week I pull a possum out of someone 's chimney - they wander around the roof trying to get inside and fall down the chimney , '' said Mr Williamson , who has been rescuing animals for 23 years .
" I 've seen it all and done over 30,000 rescues in that time . ''
In February , EnergyAustralia had to " wildlife - proof ' ' up to a dozen sub-stations after a possum knocked out power at a substation in Avalon and left 15,000 homes without power .
The possums had been using overhead powerlines as highways to safety from cats and foxes .
Scientists using a combination of radio and X - rays have found the most recent supernova remnant observed in our galaxy , located about 26,000 light - years from here .
It ’s the youngest , most energetic supernova we know and could shed light on just exactly how the stardust we ’re made of — heavier elements and all — gets created .
The finding also lends some support to astronomers ’
calculations that there should be about three supernovae in our galaxy per century , although they still need to find dozens more similar supernova remnants to confirm their suspicions .
All - in - all , it was an interesting moment for astronomy , despite the racist , conspiracy - theorists who crashed the science teleparty and derailed the conversation .
Liveblog :
NASA scientists at the Chandra X- ray Observatory are holding a teleconference this morning to announce " the discovery of an object in our Galaxy astronomers have been hunting for more than 50 years . "
The press release announcing the teleconference generated considerable speculation , despite the efforts of some astronomers , so we ’re going to bring you live coverage of the announcement starting at 10 AM PST /1 PM Eastern .
We think it ’ll be interesting , but if it is n’t , you ’ll be the first to know the news is boring .
There ’s a stream of the audio available , but I ’ll be on the phone , so if you ’ve got any burning questions you want asked , Tweet @alexismadrigal , AIM : gatobarb , or post a comment .
I ’ll be updating the post as the conference happens , so remember to hit the old refresh button .
9:57 AM : Headset on .
Excellent classical music on the hold line .
( Vivaldi , maybe ? )
10:03 : NASA press release goes live , spoiling the fun .
Scientists using NASA ’s Chandra X-ray Observatory have discovered the Milky Way ’s most recent supernova , which exploded a mere 140 years ago , a few years after the Civil War .
It ’s not exactly the discovery of extraterrestrials our readers were hoping for , but it ’s a significant finding .
10:05 : Still on hold .
But news :
Previously , the latest known supernova occurred in 1680 , right around the time Newton published his Principia .
A discovery like this was long sought - after and lends support to astronomers ’ rough estimate that three supernovae should explode in our galaxy each century .
Scientists calculated the rough age of the supernova by tracking the expansion of its remains from 1985 until new observations were made last year .
The remains , as you can see in the picture , had expanded 16 percent .
10:08 : Call starts .
Two discoverers will be on the line : Stephen Reynolds of NC State and David Green , University of Cambridge .
Also , a third - party commentator : Bob Kirshner .
Reynolds says , " The discovery addresses a lack of recent supernova in our galaxy . "
10:16 : Reynolds continuing : Supernova located approximately 26,000 light years away from here .
Shockwave moving 5 percent of the speed of light , the fastest ever observed .
This supernova exhibits special kind of X - ray activity , one of only 4 supernovae with these X - rays , which are incredibly high - energy , far beyond anything that even the Large Hadron Collider will create .
10:18 : Supernovae are incredibly energetic and often visible across the universe , but this one , known as G1.9+0.3 , was obscured by the cosmic dust near the center of the galaxy .
The scientists said the dust made the explosion a trillion times fainter in optical light than an unobscured explosion .
Green said that this is a very interesting remnant .
It ’s the youngest and smallest and has the highest expansion speed and highest electron energy .
" We ’re confident we will continue to find interesting information about supernova , supernovae remnants . "
10:25 : Kirshner gets on the line to provide context , says interesting things :
Why are we interested in this ?
Self - interest .
Supernovae make the chemical elements through real alchemy .
The calcium in our bones and iron in our blood came from supernovae that exploded .
So we ’re all star dust and it seems reasonable to want to know how elements get formed when stars explode , " he said .
Unlike older supernova remnants : " For young objects like this one , you ’re getting to see the rock that made the splash , not the wave that ’s going out into the pond . "
" This is a stellar death and the corpse is still warm , " he concluded .
10:30 : Young sounding guy gets on the Q&A line and asks , " Does this discovery have the potential to get the moon crickets shipped off Earth ? " WTF ?
say the scientists in nicer , longer words .
Anyone know what that was about ?
10:36 : Commenter answers : " ’ Moon Crickets ’ and ‘ Swoogies ’ ( ED : which the questioner also said ) are racial slurs . "
Yikes : how’d that guy get the dial - in number ? )
The scientists are discussing the difficulty of finding supernovae in the galactic haystack .
Also , added more NASA pictures after the jump .
10:40 : After a brief discussion of other younger remnants , Kirshner says : " It ’s great to have this album of baby pictures for exploding stars , but there might be more than one kind …
We know there are different types of explosions .
Some are from massive stars and some are thermonuclear explosions in low - mass stars . "
10:42 : Another weird moment at the end of the call : a man started yelling , " Hello ?
I want to talk to you .
Let ’s talk about you guys … " and then I think he might have made a reference to the female genitalia .
That ’s when NASA shut down the teleconference .
For a moment , though , the researchers appeared to think they were off - the - air .
Green said , " Aside from the couple of loonies , I think that went quite well . "
The research will appear in The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Do n’t forget to take a peek at the pictures after the jump .
The Bad Astronomy blog also has excellent commentary on the discovery .

BBC News , Kabul
The mullah is now reportedly back in Helmand fighting British troops
Mullah Sorkh Naqaibullah told the BBC he paid $ 15,000 ( £ 7,500 ) to the Afghan authorities to win his freedom .
It was the third time that the leader , known as the " Red Mullah " , had been captured and released , he said .
Mullah Naqaibullah operates in Helmand province , where there is a large concentration of British troops .
' Released '
He told the BBC he had been released from custody for the third time in three years after paying a bribe to an Afghan National Directorate of Security official .
Mullah Naqaibullah is reputedly a top Taleban leader
On the last occasion he said that he had been held for more than five months , but was now back in the Gereshk and surrounding districts of Helmand province leading a group of insurgents .
" I was arrested on 24 July and then they sent me into Kabul National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) custody , " he said .
" The law is they can keep suspects in the NDS for two months and after that they have to send them to court .
" But I was in NDS custody for five months .
On Friday ( 4 January ) a visitor came to see me , and met the NDS officer on the gate .
" He paid $ 15,000 to the officer , who then released me . "
Investigation
Mullah Naqaibullah also explained how in 2004 he had bribed his way out of Kabul 's notorious Pul - e - Charkhi prison , 16 months after being caught in Helmand .
He said he did the same thing the following year - 2005 - by bribing police to let him go after he had been caught again .
An NDS spokesman refused to comment on his allegations , saying he could not confirm whether the reports were right or wrong .
But another NDS source confirmed that Mullah Naqaibullah had been released , and that an investigation had begun to track down those responsible .
A Taleban spokesman said Mullah Naqaibullah had returned to Helmand .
What is the importance of the war in Iraq relative to other current issues ?
This is a question I am often asked , especially as Americans continue to become increasingly aware that something is very wrong with the economy .
The difficulty with the way the question is often asked relates to the perception that we are somehow able to divide such issues , or to isolate the cost of war into arbitrarily defined areas such as national security or international relations .
War is an all - encompassing governmental activity .
The impact of war on our ability to defend ourselves from future attack , and upon America ‘s standing in the world , is only a mere fraction of the total overall effect that war has on our nation and the policies of its government .
The cost of this particular war is enormous , and therefore it ’s of great importance .
There is no single issue that is more important at this particular time .
The war has , of course , made us less safe as a nation and damaged our credibility with allies and hostile nations alike .
Moreover , years of growing deficits have been spurred on by the high price tag of war , and the decision to pay that price primarily by supplemental spending rather than traditional " on- budget " accounting .
War takes what would otherwise be productive economic capacity and transfers both that capacity and the wealth it would generate in normal , peaceful times into far less economically viable activities .
It also impacts budget priorities in ways that are detrimental to our nation .
I have often pointed to the fact that we are building bridges in Iraq while they are collapsing in the United States .
All war , but most particularly war funded by monetary inflation , bleeds a country in multiple ways .
Obviously , many of the young people who are in the military literally give their blood , and sometimes their lives , fighting in wars of this type .
Meanwhile , those who do not fight the war , but fund it , are forced to pay both the immediate costs , as well as seeing their long - term purchasing power erode , as the twin pillars of debt and inflation are foisted upon the backs of current taxpayers and future generations .
Neither conspiracy nor coincidence explains steep increases in the price of gas as the war drags on .
No , this is simply a reality of the inflationary policies that , among other things , make this war possible .
As people are continually asked to choose whether our nation ’s teetering economy or the failed foreign policy of the past several decades is more important as we look forward , it is well for those of us who understand that these two issues are closely linked to continue to explain this fact to our fellow citizens .
To fix the problem requires a proper diagnosis .

Just use padding where you might have had whitespace .
Normally you might have white space between your links like this :
< div class = " nav " > < a href= " " >
First link < /a> < a href= " " >
Second link </ a> </div >
Instead , use clickable padding on the anchors to create space between them :
< style > div.nav a { padding : 5 px ; } </style > < div class = " nav " > < a href= " " >
First link < /a>< a href= " " >
Second link </ a> </div >
Note how the anchors touch each other with no white space in the second example .

Taxes , Warren Buffett , and Paying My Fair Share
This week many of you will receive tax rebate checks from the I.R.S.
Yes , that $ 600 you are receiving is meant to help kick start the economy .
The government tried the same thing in 2001 , sending out $ 300 checks .
But this time , there ’s a difference — not all of us are getting a check .
In fact , those earning six figures or more wo n’t be seeing any check this week .
So that got me to thinking about how fair the tax system really is .
Do the well - off pay their fair share , or do they also deserve a tax break ?
Well , let ’s start with the ultra-rich .
Bajillionaire Warren Buffett has argued that he is n’t being asked to pay his share .
He went around his office , asking people what share of their income they pay in income taxes .
Buffett ’s 17.7 percent tax rate compared a bit too favorably with the 30 percent tax rate paid by his secretary .
So it appears that the tax system favors the super - rich over working stiffs .
And Buffett went a step further , putting his money where his mouth is .
Last November he issued a challenge to his fellow billionaires :
I ’ll bet a million dollars against any member of the Forbes 400 who challenges me that the average ( federal tax rate including income and payroll taxes ) for the Forbes 400 will be less than the average of their receptionists .
So far , no - one has taken him up on this bet .
What about those of us who are merely among the well - off , and not in the Buffett - stratosphere ?
Now , I ’m no Warren Buffett ( believe me ! ) , but I ’ve just finished figuring out my federal taxes for the year .
I live comfortably ( one of the virtues of teaching in a business school ) , but was dismayed to learn that my federal taxes for 2007 amount to only 16 percent of my income .
This strikes me as astonishingly low .
And it ’s not like I have a fancy approach to tax minimization ; I just write off a bunch of business - related expenses , and benefit enormously from deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving .
Obviously city and state taxes drive my total tax bill up a bit further , as do payroll taxes , although I plan on getting some of that back as social security in my old age .
But the point remains : I had never quite realized that the Warren Buffett problem extends far enough down the income distribution that even folks like myself are n’t paying their fair share .
So I repeated Warren Buffett ’s experiment here at Wharton .
And it appears that I ’m paying lower taxes than the administrative staff in my department .
And if it is true here , I suspect the same goes equally for most folks in the top 10 percent of income earners .
( Incidentally , according to Piketty and Saez , around half of all income in the U.S. goes to those of us in the top decile — roughly anyone with a family income of six figures or more . )
Warren Buffett ’s approach to casual empiricism is quite instructive .
He just took a survey around the office of people ’s average tax rates , finding that he paid the lowest share .
Here ’s a thought :
Why not run a similar survey in your own office , or among your circle of friends ?
It will be interesting to learn the extent to which Warren Buffett ’s findings generalize .
Please post your findings in the comments .
Raquel Christie ’s article in the latest American Journalism Review is a thorough analysis and critique of media coverage of the Jena 6 controversy which S&R has done its own thorough job of ranting about .
Her conclusions , based on interviews with reporters and bloggers involved are relatively straightforward :
1 ) Local media slanted its coverage to make the Jena story as much about unfair reporting by the national media – thereby misleading casual observers of the Jena events that the story was about “ more of the same ” injustice in a stereotypically racist Southern small town .
2 ) National media pursued its usual “ celebrity driven ” line and only really went into the Jena story once national figures like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton associated themselves with it .
3 ) National media relied too much on using information provided to them by sources with agendas ( including blogs such as this one ) .
4 ) Local media spent far too much time reporting about what “ good folks ” the citizens of Jena / LaSalle Parish / Louisiana are – sometimes to the point of ignoring some of their more questionable actions .
This seeming disconnect between views is well expressed in this observation by the dean of faculty at the Poynter Institute :
The most profound realization coming out of those two conversations was how utterly differently two people could see the same story , ” Woods says .
“ To essentially paint it as the participants did , in the case of Paul [ Carty of the Alexandria , LA , Town Talk ] , a story about overblown and incorrect media coverage , as much as it was about Jena , and to Shawn [ Williams of the blog Dallas South ] , it was a story about injustice .
– Keith Woods , Poynter Institute
Meanwhile , the young men known as the Jena 6 continue to struggle with moving forward with their lives and putting the Jena incident behind them .
That ’s the thing about the sound and fury of reporting a case like that of the Jena 6 .
To some , like the national media , it means almost nothing .
To others , like the kids involved , it means almost everything .
Who do you think are the most cynical people in the world ?
Cops ?
Executioners ?
Or maybe prostitutes ?
Clowns ?
We 're thinking it 's doctors .
If you want proof , check out some of the horrifying - yet - hilarious slang they use around the office .
Yes , these are real .

8 PRATFO What It Means : Patient Reassured And Told to Fuck Off .
When It 's Used :
When a patient comes into the ER more hysterical than ill , the doctor reassures the patient and asks them to leave .
However , this acronym has gotten at least one doctor into trouble when he scribbled it in a patient 's chart and then later was asked to explain it in court .

“ LCDs are growing fast , and basically taking over the market , ” he said .
About 76 million LCD televisions will be sold worldwide this year , and about 99 million next year , iSupply predicts .
By 2011 , sales of 165 million LCD sets are forecast .
In contrast , he said , only about 13,000 of the new OLED televisions will be sold in 2008 .
Consumers can buy a 50 - inch LCD television for roughly the same price as the much smaller Sony OLED , he said , largely because of economies of scale .
But OLEDs may gradually become more popular , said Paul Gagnon , an analyst at DisplaySearch , a market research firm in Austin , Tex .
“ There ’s speculation that beyond 2015 , OLEDs could advance to become a creditable threat to the LCD flat - panel business , ” he said .
OLEDs have some technical advantages .
LCDs typically use white light that is filtered into primary colors and remixed .
“ You lose some of the breadth of the color spectrum that you see in the natural world , ” Mr. Semenza said of the process .
“ But OLEDs , depending on the materials and processes , produce highly saturated individual colors that are then combined to make this broad color spectrum and wide viewing angle . ”
OLEDs also have the potential to be produced cheaply .
“ The materials emit their own light , ” he said , “ so you do n’t need the back or side lights of LCDs , or theoretically all of the color filters . ”
Small OLED panels are already starting to catch on in mobile displays in Asia , said Chris Chinnock , president of Insight Media , a market research firm in Norwalk , Conn .
“ The OLED displays on mobile phones have the same advantages as the TV  wide viewing angles , great colors and thinness , ” he said .
“ All of those factors are very attractive if you are going to run TV and video on cellphones . ”
The semiconductor technology of light - emitting diodes is traditionally based on inorganic materials like silicon .
In the new , parallel electronic universe of OLEDs , though , carbon - based organic materials provide the glow .
Pioneering work in the technology was done in the 1950s by Martin Pope , now an emeritus chemistry professor at New York University .
Sony displayed one of the new televisions at a recent symposium in honor of Professor Pope ’s classic work .
“ I was amazed , ” he said .
“ I could n’t believe that engineers could do that from my experiments with little jars and bottles . ”

And the filmmakers spray all this stuff around in a brave and noble cause .
American diplomatic efforts have so far proved inadequate to the task of bringing peace to the Middle East , but “ You Do n’t Mess With the Zohan ” taps into deeper and more durable sources of American global power in its quest for a plausible end to hostilities .
Ancient grievances and festering hatreds are no match for the forces of sex , money , celebrity and exuberant , unapologetic stupidity .
Image The Phantom ( John Turturro ) vs. the Zohan ( Adam Sandler ) .

Zohan ( Mr. Sandler ) certainly seems to think so , though he might express his views differently , and certainly with a thicker accent .
A highly skilled military operative who specializes in counterterrorism , he is basically a less anguished version of the character played by Eric Bana in “ Munich . ”
The brilliant opening sequence places him in a tableau that would bring a tear to Theodor Herzl ’s eye .
Whether it would be a tear of joy or dismay I will leave to more seasoned polemicists , but there is something both appealing and authentic about a vision of the Jewish state on its 60th birthday that emphasizes lithe young bodies frolicking , flirting and playing Hacky Sack on the beach .
If you will it , it is no dream .
But only part of Zohan ’s life is carefree , and it ’s the other part  the job that requires heavy weapons , deadly stealth and hand - to - hand combat with a superterrorist called the Phantom ( John Turturro )  that drives him into the diaspora .
Zohan may have a picture of Moshe Dayan on his bedroom wall , but his real idol is Paul Mitchell , the American hair - care mogul whose outdated styles Zohan studies as if they were pages of the Talmud .
He wants to stop fighting and cut “ silky smooth ” hair .
And so , like everyone else with a dream , he migrates to New York , where he finds an entry - level job at a salon run by a pretty Palestinian named Dalia ( Emmanuelle Chriqui ) .
A romance between them seems at once inevitable and unthinkable , but the taboos that “ You Do n’t Mess With the Zohan ” is unwilling to smash are few indeed .
The movie is principally interested in establishing its main character as a new archetype in the annals of Jewish humor .
He ’s a warrior and also , to an extent undreamed of in the combined works of Philip Roth , Woody Allen and Howard Stern , a sexual hedonist , so utterly free of neurosis or inhibition that it ’s hard to imagine him and Sigmund Freud occupying the same planet , much less the same cultural - religious tradition .
Sex , for Zohan , is like hummus : there is an endless supply , and no occasion on which it could be judged inappropriate .
He is always on the make , but Mr. Sandler ’s natural sweetness inoculates the character against sleaziness .
In his feathery ’ 80s haircut and loud , half - buttoned shirts , Zohan joins a long tradition , stretching back from Will Ferrell through Steve Martin to the great Jerry Lewis himself , of goofballs who mistake themselves for studs and turn out to be right .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain runs even with Democratic rival Barack Obama and narrowly leads Hillary Clinton in potential match - ups in November , according to a Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday .
McCain was seen as a better steward of the economy than either Democrat despite their repeated criticism of his economic credentials .
He led Obama by 3 points and Clinton by 5 points on the question of who would best manage the economy .
In the Democratic race , Obama widened his national lead over Clinton to 51 percent from 38 percent , up from a 3 - point edge in March , in polling taken before a controversy erupted over Obama ’s comments about small - town residents .
The two Democrats , battling for the right to face McCain in November ’s presidential election , both gained ground on the Arizona senator nationally in the last month although Obama fares slightly better in head - to - head match - ups .
Obama pulled into a statistical tie with McCain at 45 percent after trailing him by 6 points last month .
Clinton trails McCain by 5 points , 46 percent to 41 percent , gaining slightly from an 8 - point deficit last month .
“ Obama still does better than Clinton against McCain , but it ’s a very close race either way , ” pollster John Zogby said .
“ Obama and Clinton hurt each other the longer their race drags on , and McCain is getting a free pass . ”
Heading into the next Democratic contest in Pennsylvania on Tuesday , Obama has been under heavy fire from Clinton and McCain for saying small - town residents are bitter about the ailing economy and cling to religion , guns and anti-immigrant bigotry in frustration .
The national poll , taken Thursday through Saturday , was nearly completed before the Obama controversy erupted when his April 6 comments at a private San Francisco fundraiser became public on Friday night .
The furor ’s impact on the Democratic race is unclear .
CYCLICAL RACE
Obama had gained ground on Clinton in the last month after weathering a controversy over inflammatory statements by his pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , while Clinton came under fire for falsely claiming to have faced sniper fire in Bosnia in 1996 .
“ Obama rebounded from the Reverend Wright situation and it was Clinton ’s turn to get scrutinized , ” Zogby said .
“ Now it ’s back to Obama for the small - town comments .
This race has been very cyclical . ”
The poll found Obama made gains in the last month among at least two key national constituencies that have sustained Clinton ’s bid .
The Illinois senator led among women , 48 percent to 42 percent , and among whites , 46 percent to 41 percent .
Obama also held big leads among men , blacks , young voters and high - income voters .
Clinton , a New York senator , led among the elderly , Hispanics and voters with less than a high - school education .

Obama has been steadily narrowing the gap on Clinton in Pennsylvania , where her sizable double - digit poll lead had dwindled to single digits in most recent polls .
An Obama win in Pennsylvania could knock Clinton out of the race , while she needs a big victory to make headway in her effort to overtake Obama in the popular vote cast in state contests and pledged delegates to the nominating convention .
With 10 contests remaining , Obama has a nearly unassailable lead in pledged delegates , but neither candidate is likely to gain enough delegates to win without help from nearly 800 Democratic Party officials and insiders who are free to back any candidate .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
The poll also gauged potential head - to - head match - ups if independent Ralph Nader or possible Libertarian candidate Bob Barr , a former congressman , get on the ballot .
Nader drew 3 percent and Barr 2 percent in both national match - ups .
McCain fared slightly worse against Obama with Barr and Nader in the race , but their presence did not change his margin over Clinton .
The national survey of 532 likely Democratic primary voters had a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points .
The poll of the race between McCain and the two Democratic contenders surveyed 1,049 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points .

Sure , we 've seen a set of robotic chompers before , but a team of scientists led by one Gaëlle Arvisenet is taking artificial mouths to a new plateau .
In a study set to be released in next week 's Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry , researchers report on the " design of an artificial mouth that mimics the first vital steps of human digestion -- chewing , saliva release and the initial breakdown of food . "
In order to ensure accuracy in the mechanical chewer , the gurus actually compared masticated apple pulp from human mouths as well as the robotic version ; they reportedly scrutinized texture , color and aromatic compound release .
Great , as if we really need our next humanoid servant to start begging for eats .

Western Oklahoma sheriff was accused of forcing and bribing female inmates using them as sex slaves in his jail .
State prosecutors filed 35 felony charges against Sheriff Mike Burgess , including 14 counts of second - degree rape , 7 counts of forcible oral sodomy , 5 counts of bribery , as well as sexual battery , rape by instrumentation and subornation of perjury , engaging in indecent exposure and kidnapping .
Burgess quit the position of Sheriff Wednesday just before his arrest and his appearance in court .
He was released after posting $ 50,000 bail .
His attorney Steve Huddleston explained that he has n't yet examined all the allegations against Burgess .
Supposedly , the crimes occurred between October 2005 and April 2007 .
The lawsuit was brought by 12 former inmates , who claimed that he arranged wet T - shirt contests where his inmates had to demonstrate their breasts to be rewarded with cigarettes .
Besides , Sheriff also faces charges of having sex with a female drug court participant who was in his custody .
One of the drug court participants said that he threatened her with prison if did n't agree with his sexual demands .
One of the inmates claimed that she was promoted as a jail trusty after engaging in sexual act with Burgess , but was disgraced after she later refused .
Burgess faces 467 years sentence , a prosecutor James Boring said , but most probably the lesser sentence is expected .

MetroMPG has opened a fuel economy forum

Save fuel with a ScanGauge II fuel economy computer .
I personally recommend this tool .
I 've owned both versions ( I and II ) and can't say enough good things about it .
If you 're serious about saving fuel , get one .
For more information and to order , visit EcoModder .
Interview with Ron DeLong , inventor of the ScanGauge Posted Wednesday , February 21/07 in General The ScanGauge has become such an indispensable tool for fuel efficiency enthusiasts that some people , when shopping for second - hand vehicles , have stopped considering pre-1996 models to ensure that a ScanGauge can be used .
In other words , it has quickly become the fuel saver 's favourite gadget .
With this in mind , I set out to learn more about the history of the ScanGauge and its inventor , Ron DeLong .
I recently spoke to Ron on a range of topics : his background , how the ScanGauge came to be , and some future plans for the magic little box .
In the beginning ... Ford of Canada gets the dubious honour of having built a problematic dual - fuel F - 150 which led Ron DeLong to his ScanGauge ' Eureka ! ' moment .
It started back in 2001 with a brand new Ford F - 150 pickup truck that Ron had bought .
It was n't running right , and its fuel economy was n't up to snuff .
Said Ron , " the 500 cubic inch engine in my 1976 Eldorado convertible was getting better mileage than this truck ! "
At the Ford dealership , Ron described his fuel consumption concerns to the technician , who plugged a box into the truck 's OBDII port and took him out for a drive .
" The technician was saying : ' these trucks are really sensitive to driving habits , ' and he was using instant feedback from this monitor to give me pointers on what to do to increase fuel economy . "
" I said : ' Sure , but I do n't have my own little box to tell me what I 'm doing ! ' "
The light bulb went on ...
Fortunately , Ron was well positioned to take this " Eureka ! " moment and do something productive with it .
In his words , he 'd been " doing data " for a long time , having graduated as an electrical engineer from Cal Poly Pomona in 1975 , and with years of work in the automotive industry .
Honda is currently using another of Ron 's developments - the Motorola E- Field integrated circuit - to control airbag deployment in side airbag - equipped vehicles .
( In fact , your vehicle may be equipped with another device that Ron developed while working at Motorola , in collaboration with MIT .
If you 're driving a Honda with side airbags , those airbags are controlled by an " E - Field " electric field sensing microchip that determines the presence , location and size of the vehicle 's occupants to tailor an appropriate airbag response in the event of a collision .
Other OEM's are looking at the E - Field chip , and the technology has potential beyond the auto sector . )
Full time retiree ...
Ron retired from Motorola to start Linear - Logic and work full time on the ScanGauge .
The business now employs 5 people in Mesa , Arizona , where the programming and assembly is also done .
The first version of the ScanGauge went into production in late 2004 .
Last June ( 2006 ) , the ScanGaugeII came out .
Who uses the ScanGauge ?
According to Ron , it 's been embraced by 3 general groups ...
Traditional gearheads :
Ron explains , " these are the guys who in the old days used to install extra gauges on the dash that gave more info than the idiot lights could . "
Typically " performance " ( speed ) oriented folks , these DIY types want to know everything the car is doing when it 's being pushed hard .

Typically " performance " ( speed ) oriented folks , these DIY types want to know everything the car is doing when it 's being pushed hard .
RV owners : these people have a kind of mixed interest .
The engines in their ( typically heavy , un-aerodynamic ) vehicles also tend to get pushed fairly hard , so the drivers want to keep an eye on critical info .
At the same time they 're also concerned about fuel economy and want to monitor that as well .

The engines in their ( typically heavy , un-aerodynamic ) vehicles also tend to get pushed fairly hard , so the drivers want to keep an eye on critical info .
At the same time they 're also concerned about fuel economy and want to monitor that as well .
Fuel economy nuts : these are the MPG obsessed folks ( you know who you are ) who , prior to the ScanGauge , had to rely on infrequent fill - ups , or relatively crude vacuum gauges for feedback on driving technique or changes made to their vehicles .
Customer feedback ... Feedback from customers prompted Linear - Logic to place the original ScanGauge ( top ) on a strict diet , with good results for the svelte ScanGaugeII ( bottom ) .
After the launch of the original ScanGauge , the most frequent comment received at Linear - Logic was related to aesthetics : customers wanted a sleeker package , and a display that was easier to read .
The ScanGaugeII was Linear - Logic 's response : 1/ 4 the size , but with a larger display and user - selectable backlight colour .
Ron says another common request was for the ability to reprogram the unit in the field .
While the company still accepts units back to be reprogrammed with the latest version of the software , they 're trying to get away from this with a secure interface that will permit customers to download the software and upgrade it themselves by connecting the ScanGaugeII to their home computer .
Trials & tribulations ... I asked Ron what kinds of challenges he faced while developing the ScanGauge .
" What takes the most time are the vehicle incompatibilities & bugs , " he says .
He spends a lot of time troubleshooting different vehicles and the way they communicate ( or do n't communicate ) about their various systems through the OBDII port .
An example familiar to many fuel economy enthusiasts is the " fuel cut " feature .
It 's common for fuel - injected engines to stop injecting fuel when the accelerator is released above a certain engine RPM .
The problem is that manufacturers do n't follow a standard method of describing when this mode is active .
The result is that some cars continue to report active fuel injection to the ScanGauge , even when it 's not actually happening .
( Ron adds that if your car happens to be one which does n't accurately report its fuel cut state via the ScanGauge , the net effect on fuel consumption calculations is very small , likely 0.1 % . )
Another example : " We were having some trouble with multi- displacement systems . "
GM's ' Displacement on Demand ' is one such system , but the issue is n't limited to GM 's cars :
" The problem is that there is no industry standard method to indicate the displacement change via OBDII . "
In cases like these , Ron says he rents the troublesome vehicles to sort out each one 's idiosyncrasies .
He adds that he has discovered some manufacturers are notably worse than others at following industry protocols .
Looking ahead ...
What might we see in future ScanGauge versions / software releases ?
I was happy to learn from Ron that one future upgrade is the ability to view both Trip ( average ) and Instant fuel consumption on the same screen ( on the " Gauges " screen ) .
This is something I know many fuel economy nuts will appreciate .
Another future improvement that ScanGauge aficionados may already be aware is coming is the ability to log data for viewing / analysis on any computer .
( The current ScanGauge II already has the the physical interface that will enable this feature when it 's released . )
The previously mentioned in - the - field programming feature would also permit users to download upgrades from Linear - Logic that are customized for specific car models .
Toyota Prius owners , for example , could download and install on their ScanGauges a custom gauge package and fuel consumption algorithm .
This would give them more detailed information than is currently available - for example , about the hybrid battery pack temperature and state of charge .
I was surprised to learn that some vehicles offer much more information than is currently available in the standard set of gauges the ScanGauge currently offers .
For example , some cars have multiple temperature sensors ( e.g. cylinder head , transmission ) , or a gear indicator ( drivers of automatic transmissions would benefit knowing when the torque converter is locked up ) .
Ron says he would like to offer ScanGaugeII users the ability to access this vehicle - specific information through " custom " user - definable gauges .
Ron emphasized that the current ScanGaugeII was designed to have a long shelf life : " Its processor is currently less than 1/2 utilized . "
So , as new software features are developed , users will be able to add them to their existing unit with in - the - field re-programming .
He does n't intend to force people to wait for a " ScanGaugeIII " to get these upgrades .
Old school blues ...
Unfortunately , owners of pre-OBDII cars will not be seeing a slick ScanGauge - like instrument from Linear - Logic .
Another question that comes up frequently in fuel economy forums is what kind of fuel economy instrumentation is available for pre-OBDII vehicles .
I asked Ron if he had any plans to offer a ScanGauge that would work with older cars .
" We considered it for some of the more popular vehicles , but even within the same model year there are protocol differences that make this complicated , " he said .
By the sounds of it , Linear - Logic has its hands full improving a good product for a growing market ( OBDII - compliant vehicles ) , rather than worrying about a relatively small group of folks driving a declining number of older vehicles .
Which raises the final question :
How 's business ?
" It has been successful mainly through online sales and word - of - mouth , " Ron says .
" We are only now making a concerted effort to get it into stores and promote it more through advertising . "
I can personally attest to the success of the word of mouth process because I 've been part of it .
I 've been directly responsible for several people getting ScanGauges , and have likely indirectly influenced many more through this site and in the forums .
As an unapologetic fan of Linear - Logic 's work , I for one am happy that Ron DeLong had trouble with that Ford pickup back in 2001 .
Future plans for the ScanGauge sound exciting - which is no surprise to me , given the enthusiasm that Ron projects when talking about his work .
I wish him and his company continued success and look forward to the future evolution of the ScanGauge .

SEINFELD ’S George Cos tanza famously quipped : “ It ’s not a lie if you be lieve it . ”
This is how a Clinton – take your pick , Hillary , Bill or Chelsea – makes it through the day .
Better living through self - delusion .
To burnish her foreign - policy - leadership credentials , Sen. Clinton has repeatedly peddled a harrowing anecdote about dodging sniper fire during a trip to Tuzla , Bosnia , in 1996 .
She brought her then - teenage daughter Chelsea on the dangerous mission .
And entertainer Sinbad .
And singer Sheryl Crow .
And , oh , yeah , there was 8 - year - old Emina Bicakcic , a Bosnian girl who calmly embraced the intrepid first lady and read her a poem on the tarmac – while a huge contingent of children , parents and other onlookers surrounded them with not the least bit of concern about flying bullets .
When Sinbad , The Washington Post and every fact - checker on the Internet and under the sun debunked her tall tale , Sen. Clinton doubled down .
She dissed Sinbad as a mere “ comedian . ”
She asserted that she and her compatriots ran for safety with “ our heads down . ”
She clung to her story that she “ had to be moved inside because of sniper fire . ”
And she embellished further : “ There was no greeting ceremony , and we were basically told to run to our cars .
Now , that is what happened . ”
When video of the cheery greeting ceremony surfaced this week showing no such thing , Hillary ’s Truth Deficit Disorder kicked in and the symptomatic excuses poured forth .
She “ misspoke . ”
Besides , she pooh - poohed , “ I say a lot of things – millions of words a day – so if I misspoke , that was just a misstatement . ”
Priceless campaign slogan :
The more she speaks , the more she “ mis ” - speaks .
Finally , truth in Clinton advertising !
( In our family , by the way , we call this condition “ diarrhea of the mouth . ” )
And Hillary ’s not done .
She sniffed that her Tuzla hustle was just a “ minor blip . ” A “ minor blip ” that she just happened to tell , retell and adorn in her 2003 autobiography – and in Dubuque , Iowa , Waco , Texas and Washington , DC , over the past three months – to illustrate her bravery , fortitude , expertise and massive foreign - policy - experience edge over Barack Obama .
In a radio interview Tuesday , Hillary blamed her congenital dissembling on being “ sleep - deprived . ”
If that ’s so , then Hillary has been a walking zombie for years .
This is the woman who insisted for more than a decade that she was named after the late , great mountain - climber Sir Edmund Hillary – never mind that she was born six years before he scaled Mt. Everest in 1953 .
This is the woman who told “ Dateline NBC ” that daughter Chelsea was on a jog in New York City when the jihadists struck on 9/11 – never mind that Chelsea later wrote a magazine essay revealing that she watched the attacks on TV from a friend ’s apartment .
This is the woman who claimed to have “ helped start ” the federal Children ’s Health Insurance Program – never mind that the program ’s original sponsors noted that Sen .
Clinton fought against the initial bill and had no role in writing the legislation .
This is the woman who ( echoed by her husband and daughter ) bragged that she was the “ first ” to call the disaster in Darfur “ genocide ” – never mind that several other senators had done so in 2004 , while her first press statement referring to Darfur as “ genocide ” was n’t until March 2006 .
This is the woman who claimed to have organized “ instrumental ” meetings in Belfast and baldly asserted that she “ helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland ” – never mind that key negotiators dismissed her as “ totally invisible , ” “ cheerleading ” and “ a wee bit silly . ”
And we have n’t even gotten to the Whitewater era yet – which , not coincidentally , is when her Tuzla imaginary bullet - dodging adventure took place , timed to distract from all of her and her husband ’s dishonest , dirty dealings .
At least Hillary “ It ’s my mother ’s fault I lied about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary ” Clinton and Bill “ I have vivid memories of black churches burning that , uh , OK , never burned ” Clinton can be proud of raising a daughter who did n’t fall far from the reality - challenged tree .
Asked in Bloomington , Ind. , on Monday to explain how she survived the nonexistent sniper fire , the first daughter , with a promising future in fiction writing , responded smoothly : “ We were well - protected by our United States military and the United States Secret Service . ”
Behold the Democratic choices for president :
One candidate whose 20 - year spiritual guru has an adversarial relationship with America , and another who has a life - long adversarial relationship with the truth .

Like many high - schoolers my first job was at a fast - food restaurant .
I learned a lot about responsibility , working in a fast - paced environment and coping with the public .
I also learned why you should avoid eating there if at all possible .
Consider this the next time you pay a visit to your neighborhood quickie - meal joint :
1. Teenagers run the place .
The majority of the staff were under 18 years old .
Teenagers have zero vested interest in serving quality food to you .
They are biding their time until they can punch out and resume the part of their lives they give a damn about .
2. Managers ca n’t be everywhere .
Yes , the good managers will oversee the production line and make sure nothing bad happens to your food .
But they are not omnipresent .
I once witnessed a co-worker drop a large cut of roast beef on the floor while trying to load it into a slow - cook oven .
He picked it up and put it right back in .
( I reported him ) .
3 . The sneeze guard over the salad bar is worthless .
Understand that salad bar items are subjected to dirty fingers , dirty air , coughing and hacking customers and fluctuating cooling temperatures .
Face it .
The food sits out all day and God knows what happens to it before you sidle up and help yourself .
In addition , if enough of one item is too much to toss for the day , it ’ll be put out the very next day to mix with the same environmental pollutants as it did the day before .
4. Cleanliness is not top priority .
One day the restaurant ’s drainage system backed up and we sloshed around for two hours with plastic bags over our shoes , still serving food , before someone came from the Health Department to shut us down until repairs could take place .
5 . Food for you one minute , dog food the next .
For about a year , our restaurant entered into an arrangement with the local SPCA .
Food that was deemed fit for human consumption was fed to people .
After the food was under heat lamps too long , it was dropped in a bucket and picked up to be fed to dogs .
We ’re not talking quality here .
Five minutes ago , it was meant for you .
6 . You get what minimum wage pays for .
Almost anyone can get hired .
The same guy who dropped the roast beef on the floor also cut off part of his fingertip while slicing ham .
A week later he was caught smoking pot behind the drive - thru window and finally fired .
He worked under the influence a lot of the time .
Your best interest was not on his stoned - out mind .
We did n’t like to think what else he did that no one caught him doing .
7. Cross contamination is the norm .
When things got busy , the same person who just swept garbage off the floor might be asked to perform cashier duties without washing their hands in between .
They may rearrange your food on your serving tray , help the food line staff assemble sandwiches , grab cups and utensils , all with their bare hands .
What they touched , you touched and you probably put it into your mouth .

In a recent issue , we outlined how Barack Obama was told by Ted Kennedy not to take Hillary Clinton on as a running mate and gave some of the background behind that recommendation .
Basically ,
Ted knows that the Clinton and Bush crime families , who have reeked their reign of terror on the citizens of the US in the Bush - Clinton - Bush triple whammy , were most likely behind the assassination of JFK , Jr. , or if you prefer , the " accidental " plane crash that took him out of contention as a potential presidential candidate for the 2000 election year .
The " accident " took place in 1999 while Clinton was finishing his second and final term as President and the candidates for the office of President for the 2000 election year were being lined up .
JFK , Jr. could probably have beaten Dubya hands down if he had taken the Democratic nomination away from Al Gore , who in fact later won the election , but for the fraud in Florida voting counts where brother Jeb took care of things for brother George .
Al Gore , under pressure from the Bush crime family , who were in the process of " influencing " the US Supreme Court , was promised a special hat trick in connection with a movie about global warming disinformation he was asked to create and promote by upper tier Illuminists .
Hence , the piece of cinematic garbage , " An Inconvenient Truth , " which brought Gore an Emmy , an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize as payola for giving up the Presidency to Caligula .
Ted also has to know that the Clinton 's have left behind scores of dead bodies in the wake of their notorious political careers and would not hesitate to take Obama out to push Hillary into the Presidency .
He also has to know that both the Bush and Clinton crime families were major players in the neocon setup of the phony " War on Terror " and the dastardly 911 mass murder the beginnings of which were well underway during the Clinton Administration , which saw both the First World Trade Center Bombing in 1993 followed by the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995 .
So clearly Senator Obama is taking on some extremely dangerous , hardcore sociopaths , as is Ron Paul for that matter .
And Ted knows they would not hesitate to take Obama out to put the Queen of Marxism , often referred to as the " Womanoid , " into the Oval Office , if Obama was foolish enough to make her his running mate and then was to win the Presidential election against the Bush Clone , McCain , aka the " Albino Chipmunk . "
So now , a couple weeks after our original comment about Ted 's recommendation to Obama , when Hillary Clinton is asked why she is not conceding the nomination to Obama despite being hopelessly behind in the delegate count , she reminds the reporter about the Robert Kennedy assassination in June of 1968 .
Nice little " Freudian slip " there , eh !
You mean when the frontrunner was assassinated ?
Her statement seems more like a thinly veiled threat to us .
Later we are told that she was simply referring to the fact that the nomination was still being contended in June of that election year , but come on , what does that have to do with the facts and circumstances of this election and whether she should concede or not .
If Obama takes the Democratic nomination and then makes the mistake of selecting the Queen B as his running mate , he is inviting an assassination attempt , ala Gerald Ford and Rockefeller 's attempt to take him out , twice , or he will be compromised and disgraced like Richard Nixon , ala Rockefeller 's revenge on Nixon for naming Ford as his Vice President over Rockefeller to avoid the inevitable assassin 's bullet ( Nixon was indeed a reprobate , but a smart one ) .
Did you really think that Watergate was about Nixon getting caught in the cover - up and about seeking truth , justice and the American way ?
Please , spare us .
No one gets caught , unless the elitists want them to be caught .
Ask Elliot Spitzer .
Watergate was all about taking Nixon out to make way for elitist Rockefeller to become President .
The arrangement to propel S&M Master , Nelson Rockefeller , into the Presidency , came complete with a full pardon for Nixon in exchange for dupe Gerald Ford 's ascendency to the Presidency , to be followed by Rockefeller 's subsequent appointment as Vice President ( which required a Constitutional amendment that Rockefeller had made mighty efforts to pass beforehand so he could step into the Vice Presidency without being voted in by the US public who hated his perverted guts ) , and then Gerald Ford 's assassination to put the King of Perverts ( Rocky ) in the White House .
This all followed Vice President Agnew 's elitist - arranged removal through exposure of certain of his income tax " problems " so Nixon could appoint Rocky as his Vice President .
As we said , Nixon appointed Ford instead to avoid assassination at the hands of the Prince of Darkness ( Rocky ) .
Incidentally , Ford was in on the Warren Commission 's cover - up of JFK , Sr. 's treasonous assassination , and was a dupe for the elitists from the beginning .
For his services to the Illuminati , Gerald Ford received the Presidency for what , apparently unbeknownst to him , was supposed to be a very short period of time that was supposed to end with each of the two assassination attempts .
Had he been assassinated , considering his actions while on the Warren Commission , it would have been a nice piece of poetic justice .
But that would mean that elitist scumbag , Nelson Rockefeller , would have become President and taken us into World War III , so we 're glad that Ford survived .
We are called the greatest nation on earth , yet this is how our politics are conducted .
What a sham .
What a disgrace .
We predict that if Obama makes Clinton his running mate , and then beats McCain , he will not make it through his first term in office .
He will be either assassinated or disgraced out of office so the evil Marxist Womanoid can become President .
Truly , there is nothing new under the sun .
Of course , this all assumes we have an election in November , which is in substantial doubt .
Because of the treasonous actions and mass murder of 911 , the neocons must stay in power to continue the cover - up of their actions .
This is why we had voter fraud during the 2004 election , this time in Ohio instead of Florida , to ensure a Bush victory .
A loss would mean the loss of control over the CIA and the military and the potential for a real investigation into 911 , into the phony " War on Terror " , into the lies about Saddam Hussein and Iraqi WMD's to justify our entry into Iraq , into torture and other war crimes and into the mountain of corruption in connection with military and civilian no - bid contracts , payments for non-performance and missing cash and weapons , to name but a few .
The neocons are quaking in terror at the prospect of leaving their seats of power and at the potential for being exposed to endless inquiries and recriminations which might lead them to the gallows , which is where they all belong .
So all this adds up to the potential for another 911 - type false - flag attack , this time to keep the neocons in power so they can continue the cover -up of their misdeeds during a period of martial law to be declared under the auspices of the Patriot Acts and the Military Commissions Act .
As a bonus , this type of situation would be intended to draw our attention away from the intentional and malevolent destruction of our economy , which was enabled by the Illuminist , privately - owned Fed and which occurred primarily during the era of unparalleled debauchery which we refer to as the Bush - Clinton - Bush triple whammy .
The non -stop rise of oil prices may be reflecting some insider knowledge about such a false - flag attack or about the creation of a new theater of war in Lebanon , Syria , Iran , Kosovo and / or Georgia to distract attention away from the failings of our incumbent miscreants with respect to the handling of our economy ( not included among the miscreant incumbents is of course , Ron Paul , one of the few remaining true patriots left in our corrupt government ) .
Bush , Sr. has picked up some remote land in Paraguay as a new potential criminal family compound in order to hedge his bets .
The ongoing destruction of our economy and the free trade agenda were energized during the period of the Bush - Clinton - Bush triple whammy of Presidential Administrations , and all of their nefarious dealings were assisted by Reagan 's Executive Order creating the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets , also known as the PPT .
The PPT has been used to manipulate markets to assure insider - trading profits for elitists on Wall Street , in corporate America and in our government , and also to hide the destruction of our economy by preventing our markets from reflecting the truth about underlying fundamentals .
Our markets are not free , and many decisions are made based on economic statistics that are more related to opium and mushroom induced pipe - dreams of the fiction writers at the Bureau of Lying Statistics than they are to any financial realities .
This is why our markets have become counterintuitive .
And if you try to trade based on truth instead of on elitist lies about the economy , you are destroyed by nonsensical , schizophrenic market action brought about by the PPT to cover up the nefarious dealings of the Illuminati .
Charts , graphs and software programs are useless under these circumstances and cartel knowledge of what these methods predict is actually used against those who cling to them for a crutch .
Our entire society , from its citizens , to its corporations , to its government , is one big monumental cluster - you - know - what , and will only be changed when the people of our nation are made to feel the full impact of the destructive forces unleashed by the Illuminati and which the people of our nation , by their sluggish , doltish and oafish inaction , have allowed to happen .
Yes indeed , you get the kind of government you deserve , and our disgusting and revolting government , which has now succeeded in utterly destroying the US economy , could not be more richly deserved by our ignorant , complacent , narcissistic and hedonistic citizens .
The Fall of Rome will no longer be discussed .
The Fall of the United States of America will take its place .

Welcome to " The Room "
The subscribers - only home page of Casey Research Written : March 21 , 2008
Dear Reader ,
It used to be of no little pride in the small New England town where Casey Research is headquartered that school went forward , no matter the weather .
Hail , 8 - foot - high snow drifts , ice rain and , should they have occurred hereabouts ( which they didn�t ) , I am fairly sure that even hurricanes and tornadoes would not have kept the school administration from its daily labors in the brainwashing of innocent youth .
That all changed when , earlier this winter , a school bus missed the turn on a gently sloping hill and rolled onto its side , fortunately causing no serious injuries ( for some reason , which continues to baffle me , the police will stop and ticket you for driving without a seat belt , yet school buses are systematically unequipped with same ) .
The accident , no doubt , made the school officialdom aware of some previously unexamined legal consequence because the school now delays the morning opening or closes down tight on what appears to me to be so much as a semi-reliable report that a single threatening snowflake has been observed in the general vicinity .
And so it is that , with a modest snowfall in process , the kids are home again today , lounging about and , because it is Friday when I write from home , crowding me out of my office ( which counter - intuitively also serves as their toy room ) .
Which leaves me to write to you from a couch upstairs , with stern instructions to the kids that while I may appear to be in residence , they should assume I am a figment of their youthful imaginations until I have finished writing this weekly epistle .
While it is typically with a good deal of pleasure that I sit down to reminisce about the action of the week just ending , this week again , the volume of news coupled with the magnitude of that news makes the task daunting .
But no amount of dithering will make the task go away , so here we go .
� Commodities Drop , Rally in Dollar , Stocks Vindicate Bernanke �
That headline is not mine , it is from Bloomberg this morning .
Bloomberg�s enthusiasm is based , as hard as I find it to believe , on little more than that the Fed cut the rate it charges banks to borrow by �just� 75 basis points this week , and that the stock market rallied , then fell , then rallied again in response .
The herd was , apparently , expecting 1 % .
Further , not only were they expecting this , they were mentally prepared to accept a 1 % cut as a sign that the economy remained in dire straits and that , as a result , the Fed would have to continue its loose money policy .
According to the punditry , a 75 bps cut indicates that Bernanke and Co. have drawn a line in the sand , signaling they were going to be restrained in their approach to the crisis now stalking the land .
Further , this show of confidence portends that the worst of the crisis is nearly behind us .
Ready to push the trigger to buy more commodities on a 1 % rate cut , the market instead rushed into buy stocks and sell commodities � then changed its mind and sold stocks and commodities � then bought stocks again , but still sold commodities .
Gold , silver , oil , grain � you name it , if it shows up under the heading Commodities in the back of your favorite paper , then it got hit .
But of course , there was a whole lot more going on this week .
We�ll come back to the commodities momentarily .
First , however , we need to walk up a few floors to get a better view of the bigger picture .
Problem Solved ?
Now , you will excuse me if I seem a touch skeptical , but I can�t help but notice that short of climbing aboard helicopters rigged to carry pallets of dollars , the Fed is now doing exactly what we have been expecting it to : provide all the liquidity it can muster using its near mystical powers of money creation .
In addition to yet another deep cut in the Fed Funds rate , they are now making the almost unprecedented move ( at least since the Great Depression ) of lending money to non-commercial banks , in the process effectively putting taxpayers on the hook for $ 30 billion in suspect collateral from Bear Stearns .
And that �s just one of many moves of late , including cutting discount rates by a total of 1 % , to 2.5 % over the past week alone , and opening up new lending facilities that allow the investment banks to borrow directly from the Fed using as collateral the same sort of suspect paper that brought down Bear .
Playing their part , three of the biggest investment banks , Goldman , Morgan Stanley and , importantly , Lehman , announced that they were going to access this new lending facility , whether they need to or not , in order to remove the �stigma� ( their term ) of stepping up to the window , so to speak .
Give that some thought for a second .
What they were saying for all the world to hear was that they were going to engage in what is effectively an institutional shell game� a deliberate attempt to obfuscate which of the banks are actually in trouble .
As a shareholder in one of these companies , you won�t have any idea whether your bank is accessing this emergency facility because it is , in fact , in trouble .
Given the estimates that the assets being carried as capital on the books of Bear Stearns were worth only 10 % of what was being posted , and the herd - like business practices of the big investment houses , the odds are fairly high that Bear Stearns is not the only institution teetering on the brink .
Yet this week investors seemed to actually buy the idea that the worst is now over , and that the all - clear signal will soon be sounded .
What to believe ?
Whom to believe ?
Could the Fed have finally figured out the right combination to re-open the safe of prosperity ?
And what of the commodities , especially gold ?
This week I have received a larger than usual amount of incoming emails presenting all sorts of theories .
Some have it that JPMorgan , the world�s largest bullion bank , was in real trouble with shorts on gold and had been buying the metal back , helping to fuel its meteoric rise of late , but that the liquidity provided by the Fed has now taken the pressure off and allowed them to stop or slow their buying ( our own Bud Conrad has been looking into this notion , but so far has uncovered no solid proof ) .
As for the financial sector and , by extension the rest of the market , we can�t know for sure what�s going on behind the scenes , because the government and the big banks are playing it very close to the vest .
But we can , from our higher perch , try to sort the unknown from the known , and start with the latter .
U.S. investment bank and a firm tightly connected as a counter party to hundreds of billions in derivative agreements , suffered a good old - fashioned meltdown .
This week we had a major bank failure ( as predicted many months ago by Bud ) .
Despite Jim Cramer�s firm belief in the firm , Bear Stearns , the fifth largestinvestment bank and a firm tightly connected as a counter party to hundreds of billions in derivative agreements , suffered a good old - fashioned meltdown .
We know that the share price of Bear Stearns has fallen from over $ 150 last year to as low as $ 2.00 , and what is left of the firm is now being sucked into JPMorgan , but only because the Fed has agreed to stand behind the deal to the tune of $ 30 billion , an intervention the likes of which was last witnessed in the Great Depression .
U.S. investment banks .
Absent the Fed�s aggressive intervention , the odds were fairly high they would have been next to get hit with the equivalent of a run .
This is why the Treasury and the Fed worked so hard to get the Bear Stearns deal cobbled together over a single weekend , before the markets reopened and Mr. Market could recommence beserking .
From where I sit , it appears that we came within hours of seeing another of the nation�s largest financial institutions crash , potentially taking down the whole house of cards .
We also know that the vultures were starting to circle Lehman , another member of the big fiveinvestment banks .
Absent the Fed�s aggressive intervention , the odds were fairly high they would have been next to get hit with the equivalent of a run .
This is why the Treasury and the Fed worked so hard to get the Bear Stearns deal cobbled together over a single weekend , before the markets reopened and Mr. Market could recommence beserking .
From where I sit , it appears that we came within hours of seeing another of the nation�s largest financial institutions crash , potentially taking down the whole house of cards .
And we know the Fed dropped the Fed Funds rate by 0.75 , only the second time in the last decade that it has cut rates by an amount that large .
We know some other things as well .
For instance , that commodities have been on the equivalent of a one - way - up escalator in recent months .
And we know that no market goes in only one direction for any sustained period of time , and so a correction was inevitable .
Gold , oil , the grains � they all had to take a breather .
And so they have .
But Let�s Try to Keep This All in Perspective �
What has actually occurred over the last month , between February 21 and March 20 ?
Gold Silver Copper Oil Bear Stearns JPMorgan Lehman 21 - Feb -08 $ 945.00 $ 17.98 $ 3.77 $ 98.39 $ 82.23 $ 43.07 $ 54.14 20 - Mar -08 $ 925.75 $ 17.53 $ 3.62 $ 104.49 $ 5.96 $ 45.97 $ 48.65 Gain or Loss - 2.0 % - 2.5 % - 4.1 % 6.2 % - 92.8 % 6.7 % - 10.1 %
Okay , so gold and silver are off a little , copper a bit more , oil is still up , Bear Stearns is a smoking hole in the ground , JPMorgan is up a bit , and Lehman is down 10 % .
Other than Bear Stearns and , to a lesser degree , Lehman , I�m not seeing anything so earth shattering .
( Sure , gold recently took a high dive off the $ 1,000 per ounce mark � but it is still over $ 900 , a level that not one in ten thousand investors , if asked a year ago , would have expected it to trade at .
And oil over $ 100 ?
Forget about it . )
There are a few more things we know .
For instance , that consumers are debt strapped and the housing bubble has burst and is deflating rapidly .
And that falling home prices are wiping out the net worth , discretionary spending power and positive sentiment of the U.S. consumer who has , heretofore , shown a seemingly unlimited willingness to go into debt up to their eyeballs to keep the world economy afloat .
That is now changing .
We also have proof , if proof was needed , that the government will do whatever it takes to avoid a meltdown .
While they are shoving the walnut shells around so fast that it�s hard to figure out where the pea is these days , what is increasingly clear is that there is only one real plan at this point : to apply as many billions of dollars as they feel is necessary to keep the ship of state afloat .
And while some might like to think that the country is not in a recession , at this point I am going to put it down as fact that a recession is now underway and that we need to be worried about it becoming much uglier than that .
Blame it on Smokey the Bear
A good way to understand both the degree and the nature of the current crisis is to look at the state of the nation�s western forests .
Before the 1940s , forest fires were allowed to run their course , just as they had over the millennia .
But then the government adopted a policy to fight every fire , a battle epitomized by the introduction of the iconic Smokey the Bear .
What has happened since is a massive build - up in the fire risk in federally managed forests .
The following is from a CATO Institute document on the topic �
Since the advent of the Smokey Bear era in the 1940s , tree density in federal forests has increased from 50 per acre to as much as 300 to 500 per acre .
Federal forests are filled with dense stands of small , stressed trees and plants that combine with dry deadwood to provide virtual kindling wood for forest fires .
According to Forest Service statistics , some two - thirds of federally held forested lands are in deteriorating health .
The consequence of governmental meddling in the forest is that when a fire now breaks out , it is exponentially larger , more dangerous and more expensive to fight .
Nationwide , the forested area now at extreme risk is equal to an area about the size of the state of California .
One of these days , and probably sooner rather than later , there will be a forest fire of biblical proportions � and Smokey�s real - life brethren , along with houses and all that moves or doesn�t , will go up in smoke .
Similarly , by continuously tampering with the business cycle , the government has led us to the point where the dried underbrush is piled high and just waiting for a match .
The Fed was able to throw a quick tanker load of water onto the Bear Stearns fire � but that doesn�t mean we are anywhere near out of the woods .
( Don�t you just love it when your metaphors snap so nicely in line ?
I sure do ! )
Which Brings Up an Interesting Question
Given virtually unlimited power , including the ability to create money out of nothing , or to change any rule or law or convention , bend any arm , or ban or hinder trading in any commodity � just how much power can the U.S. government apply to the problems now besetting our economy and , by extension , the world ?
Or , looked at from the reverse angle , given its unlimited power , is there any way Paulson , Bernanke , et al can fail to stabilize things ?
It is an interesting discussion , and one that requires more analysis and data than I�m in a position to provide sitting here on my couch on a Friday morning .
( We will go into it in more detail in a special report on the crisis that is being worked up for paid subscribers , and which should be issued following our Scottsdale Crisis & Opportunity Summit next week . )
I will , however , comment just a bit further .
Let�s start with the proposition that the government has absolute power , which is largely the case these days , especially because the populace is so numb to large numbers that outrage at the beggaring of future generations no longer seems to be of any concern to anyone .
So , the Fed can effectively pump out all the money it needs to �get her done � and if that doesn�t do it , then the Treasury can step back in .
This approach , from a policy maker�s perspective , is quite attractive because it essentially papers over the problem .
Look at it this way .
If housing prices fall , on average , 20 % nationwide , but the currency depreciates at the same level , then housing weakness would be masked � ditto 20 % of stock market losses .
In case that point is not clear , look at it like this .
If your house is worth $ 100,000 and it loses 20 % , its value would fall to $ 80,000 .
But if the dollar was to simultaneously lose 20 % , then the price of the house would remain $ 100,000 .
The average person would be clueless they have just taken a 20 % haircut .
Pretty cool , eh ?
Unfortunately for the government , there are natural limits to everything .
In this case , the most immediate threat to this plan resides in the trillions of dollars held by foreigners .
In recent decades these foreigners , trading partners mostly , have been willing to swap our inflation in exchange for market share within the U.S. , the greatest consumption engine on the planet ( as an FYI , the eurozone just surpassed us ) .
But that inflation is beginning to be felt back home : in China , in the Middle East , Russia and everywhere between .
At some point , the pain , and the realization that inflation in the U.S. is only going to get worse , is very likely to make these dollar holders get serious about breaking their links with the dollar , and dumping the trillions they now hold .
And while U.S. consumers are well aware that everything costs more these days , no matter what the jury - rigged CPI tells them , it is when the foreigners start repatriating our dollars that the real pain of inflation will begin .
At that point , the fire starts in earnest .
I call this the Point of Mugabe , named in honor , of course , of Robert Mugabe , the supreme overlord of Zimbabwe .
A dictator with absolute power in all matters , Mugabe�s maladministration of his country�s economy has finally reached the point where today , as much as he dictates against it , inflation runs in excess of 100,000 % annually .
While the sheeple of that country seem either particularly stupid , beaten down or tolerant , sooner rather than later Mr. Mugabe�s ridiculous regime will come to an end , and probably not in a manner that he will find personally pleasant .
In the final analysis , I remain convinced that the praise of Bernanke et al based on their extreme actions this past week will find its way into the history books along with quotes such as these �
" The end of the decline of the Stock Market will probably not be long , only a few more days at most . "
� Irving Fisher , November 1929
" I see nothing in the present situation that is either menacing or warrants pessimism ...
I have every confidence that there will be a revival of activity in the spring , and that during this coming year the country will make steady progress . "
� Andrew W. Mellon , U.S. Secretary of the Treasury , December 1929
And , of course , my favorite recent example �
Jim Cramer�s rant that people should not take their money out of Bear Stearns , just a day before that firm collapsed .

We�ll have a lot more on this topic in our upcoming special update report on the crisis , which will be sent to all paid subscribers the week after next .
What �s Coming
In my reading for the above , I came across the September 2007 edition of the International Speculator and its lead article , Preparing for Crisis .
I thought the following excerpt was worth sharing , not just because it shows how spot - on Bud Conrad , the chief economist of this operation , has been in forecasting the specifics of the unfolding crisis , but because it is still as useful today as then in understanding how things are likely to keep rolling out ( the full article has much more detail , well worth reviewing ) .
Here�s the excerpt .
The credit crisis will not end soon .
Here�s what we think is coming .
More Defaults .
The bulk of the subprime loans are adjustable rate mortgages .
The continuing reset of up to $ 50 billion per month of subprime ARMs will keep mortgage defaults growing , which will keep home prices falling , which means that more of the defaults will turn into unrecoverable losses for the investors holding the paper .
The hedge funds that haven�t thrown in the towel on subprime mortgages will collapse one by one .
The economy will slow down .
Lending to risky customers has dried up .
Earnings of most corporations will slide because consumers , who can no longer turn to home equity loans and whose credit cards are already maxed out , will cut spending .
The mounting losses in CDOs and the continuing defaults in the housing industry will precipitate a severe credit crunch .
The capital of many banks is about to shrink , which will hamper their ability to lend .
Stocks will fall .
The next phase down in the stock market will come from reduced earnings estimates for 2008 .
We could see an auto company or a big bank announce insolvency .
Fear , and then the fear of fear itself , and the fear of being the last one out the door will take over .
Big , 300 or 400 point moves � mostly down � will become regular events .
People have forgotten , but they are going to be reminded , that stocks have , until fairly recently in history , normally yielded about twice as much as bonds , simply because they �re riskier .
Dollar down .
While U.S. citizens are looking to build cash � another source of pressure on spending and investment � few foreigners now want U.S. dollars or dollar - denominated debt .
After the failure of large U.S. institutions begins and the Fed turns the printing presses on full blast in an attempt to keep liquidity in the system , flight to safety will mean a flight from the dollar .
How fast they will print is hard to guess .
They�ve already started , but will probably panic as the economy slows , and then turn the presses to high .
The dollar will fall in purchasing power .
Interest rates will rise across the board , with low - quality paper hurt the worst .
If you are not yet receiving the International Speculator , now is a great time to sign up .

Show Me the Money !
This week we have , as you�d expect given gold�s steep plunge , received some email wondering when the junior gold stocks we tend to favor in the International Speculator ( among other investments that we feel are appropriate to the current environment ) will pick themselves off the mat and get on with the business of making serious money .
This is , of course , a topic I have discussed at some length recently , so I won�t go into the topic much again here ( look back over the past couple of issues , using the archive link below ) .
But I will say , again , that I remain convinced that the next big move in the junior explorers is still ahead , and will come as the big gold stocks once again confirm the new reality that they are becoming cash machines .
And they begin using their newly beefed - up balance sheets to acquire the deposits needed to replenish their depleting reserves .
If you keep selling ounces without replacing them , in time , you are nothing but a shell � and so replacing reserves is a business dictate .
On that front , Barrick just announced that it will spend $ 10 billion to acquire new mines and resources over the next little while .
You can read the story here :
And there�s this .
This week , PricewaterhouseCoopers released its Mining Deals 2007 Annual Review � which , among other prognostications reported on in an article on same by the folks at MineWeb , included these �
� 2008 looks set to see mining deals reach very high record levels as super - consolidation takes place in the market . "
Despite the credit crunch , the report finds " little evidence of a slowdown in [ mining ] deal activity . "
" Underpinning these trends is the quest for world scale , resource acquisition and resource diversification , " the analysts asserted .
The study noted that exploration costs are at all - time highs , permitting takes longer , and mining companies are facing skills ' shortages .
" These are significant barriers to meeting what is a major upturn in world demand . "
( read the full MineWeb article on the topic by clicking here . )
This is all just the tip of the iceberg if you ask me , and it bodes very , very well for the juniors that are already sitting on a discovery .
Yes , it is frustrating that some of our favorites have fallen with the broader markets lately � but this is a sector you need to be patient with .
On that topic , yesterday someone asked me if our subscribers were early adopters .
And , after a moment�s thought , I answered , � Yes .
They are looking to get in early on a trend , and in investments that will provide far bigger returns than average . �
Early adopters , however , have to possess both patience and a tolerance for risk .
If not , then you may be invested in the right sector , but with the wrong temperament� a recipe for disaster .
To wit , you won�t have the emotional staying power to get you through the inevitable down swings and so you will invariably sell at exactly the wrong time , on a big setback .
By contrast , an individual with the right temperament will continually look to buy under the market and , when that corner of their portfolio dedicated to the quality gold juniors is topped off , will look to continually upgrade at lower prices .
Because they won�t be chased out by the volatility , they�ll still be there to collect the big profits as the endgame unfolds .
This is also why investing only with money you can afford to lose and still sleep well is so important .
It assures you don�t get over - emotional and greatly improves your odds of staying the course .
And in the worst case that we are wrong and these stocks only head down to more or less a total wipeout , you might be discomforted , but you won�t be put out of the house .
I guess what I am saying is that we have never made any bones about the volatile nature of these stocks .
Please be clear on why you are buying them , and don�t kid yourself into thinking they couldn�t go down 50 % even from here .
They can .
But we wouldn�t be recommending them , or investing in them ourselves , if we didn�t think this was a play that will blow the doors off almost any other investment you could be making just now .
Energy Chart of the Week Public displays of hand wringing over America �s dependence on foreign oil have become very popular , but little attention has been paid to how natural gas imports fit into the U.S. energy equation .
Twenty years ago , the United States � natural gas production met nearly all domestic demand , but that is changing � and quickly .
The current situation is nowhere near as dire as America �s predicament with oil supplies , of which 60 % come from net imports .
But the trend of imports making up a greater share of consumption is accelerating at a more rapid pace for �natty � than it is with crude oil .
From 1985 to 2007 , America �s reliance on crude oil imports doubled , but its reliance on natural gas imports has nearly quadrupled .
Because the vast majority of natural gas imports come from Canada � normally considered a safe source of supply � little fuss has been made .
If America has to buy more natural gas from its neighbor to the north , what�s the big deal ?
They�ve been a steady supplier in the past , and it�s not the sort of place where rebels run amuck blowing up pipelines , disrupting the supply chain ( as has been the case in Mexico ) .
Under NAFTA�s proportionality clause , Canada is bound to send 60 % of its natural gas to the United States .
The problem is that Canada �s natural gas production is declining .
Making a bad situation worse , the tar sands require huge amounts of natural gas to ramp up their heavy oil operations .
Canadian winters aren�t getting any warmer either , which � coupled with a growing population � has meant steady growth in Canada �s natural gas consumption .
At recent debates , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have been arguing over who would be most qualified to tear up the NAFTA agreement .
Lost in this storm of campaign rhetoric was Canada �s response .
� You might not want to renegotiate NAFTA if you knew how badly you need that oil and gas� was the message from Jim Flaherty , Canada �s finance minister .
The Canadian government would jump at any chance to wiggle out of NAFTA�s proportionality clause , and a Democratic president might give them the opportunity .
The good news is that natural gas imports no longer arrive solely via the pipeline ; they also arrive by ship through the emerging global market in liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) .
So the United States is not restricted to Canada when looking for natural gas supply , as it was even just twenty years ago .
The bad news is that many of the biggest suppliers of LNG are located in the Middle East and Russia � precisely the regions that America wants to become less reliant on for its future energy needs .

China Still
Is Selling Us More and More Bud Conrad took a break from his preparations for our sold - out Scottsdale Summit to send over the following chart he thought you would find of interest .
There are a couple of take - aways from that chart , but the one that pops out at me is that it is a picture of American manufacturing being shipped overseas .
As a result , while there is no question that a weakening dollar will help American manufacturers , the fact that their ranks have been reduced to such a degree , will likely mute the benefits .
Real Estate , Real Trouble I ran into the mother of a close friend and a former partner at the store the other day .
I don�t think I would be exaggerating if I said she was the powerhouse real estate broker here in the resort town that is the headquarters of Casey Research .
She is the quintessential �ber - agent , �can do , � �get it done � and �never say die� kind of individual .
Always an upbeat word about the local market and tough as nails , when needs to be , to get the sale .
Yet , in our check - out conversation she made no bones about the fact that her views on the local real estate market are far less positive these days .
In fact , her words were along the lines of , � I don�t think that house prices are going to come back for another decade . �
In a discussion on the topic of real estate with my mother , who holds down the family fort on the Big Island of Hawaii , she related a tale that I had heard before , but thought relevant to the current market , and so asked her to write down the facts of the case .
Here they are : � Grandpa bought a large house in August of 1929 .
The address was 10 Sutherland Road , Montclair , N.J .
The price was about $ 45,000 .
He finally sold it for slightly less in 1945 after trying for years .
I have an excellent photo of the house but can't send it until later today when ( and if ) I manage to reinstall another all - in - one with scanner .
Love , Mom�
Could real estate really go down and stay down for 20 years ?
As hard as it seems to imagine , the answer is yes .
This is a topic
I�ll have more on next week , when I share an interview with one of your fellow subscribers who is a professional real estate appraiser of many years and great experience from Northern California .
And That , Dear Readers , Is It for this Week� I�m off tomorrow to our Scottsdale Summit .
Next week�s edition , written on the fly ( literally ) will likely be a bit reduced .
The U.S. stock market is closed for Easter , but I can�t even begin to imagine what thrills and chills it has for us next week .
We live in interesting times , indeed .
As always , thank you for taking time to read these hastily assembled thoughts .

“ It ’s not my role to set off bombs  that ’s ridiculous , ” she said in a rare interview .
“ I have a weapon .
It ’s to write .
It ’s to speak out .
That ’s my jihad .
You can do many things with words .
Writing is also a bomb . ”
Ms. El Aroud has not only made a name for herself among devotees of radical forums where she broadcasts her message of hatred toward the West .
She also is well known to intelligence officials throughout Europe as simply “ Malika ”  an Islamist who is at the forefront of the movement by women to take a larger role in the male - dominated global jihad .
The authorities have noted an increase in suicide bombings carried out by women  the American military reports that 18 women have conducted suicide missions in Iraq so far this year , compared with 8 all of last year  but they say there is also a less violent yet potentially more insidious army of women organizers , proselytizers , teachers , translators and fund - raisers , who either join their husbands in the fight or step into the breach as men are jailed or killed .
“ Women are coming of age in jihad and are entering a world once reserved for men , ” said Claude Moniquet , president of the Brussels - based European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center .
“ Malika is a role model , an icon who is bold enough to identify herself .
She plays a very important strategic role as a source of inspiration .
She ’s very clever  and extremely dangerous . ”
Ms. El Aroud began her rise to prominence because of a man in her life .
Two days before the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , her husband carried out a bombing in Afghanistan that killed the anti-Taliban resistance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud at the behest of Osama bin Laden .
Her husband was killed , and she took to the Internet as the widow of a martyr .
Lambda Animator
Launch in sandbox mode with Java Web Start or in an Applet Launch in trusted mode with Java Web Start or in an Applet
Lambda Animator is a tool for demonstrating and experimenting with alternative reduction strategies in the lambda calculus .
Eager languages reduce arguments before function application .
Lazy languages reduce arguments , if needed , after function application .
Reductions can also be performed within function bodies .
Performing reductions within functions can have a specializing effect .
If a function is applied more than once then any reductions performed within the function will be performed once before the function body is copied instead of multiple times after .
These specializing reductions can also be performed eagerly or lazily .
The specializing effect is sufficient to remove interpretive overhead .
Usage Lambda Animator can be launched in two ways :
Run in sandbox mode if you do n't want to permit access to resources on your computer .
You will be able to step through the existing examples , but you will not be able instantiate new graphs .
Run in trusted mode if you have Graphviz installed on your computer and you want to permit Lambda Animator to use it .
This will enable you to change the reduction strategy and try your own programs .

Ever Hear Of EDI Benefits ?
Probably Not – Find Out Now
Did you know that 70 % of all orders are automated by EDI / XML , portals , or exchanges ?
However , EDI came out as the preferred method of choice when it came to receiving and sending orders .
A lot of businesses in the United States and around the world have already implemented EDI and reaped the benefits of it .
However , there are still some businesses that need to start using EDI .
Keep reading to find out what EDI is , how it works , and what the main EDI benefits are .
What is EDI ?
EDI stands for electronic data interchange .
Data can be processed using computer - to - computer exchanges .
This process can be more effective than you and your employees having to input and send data .
By eliminating human error , such as forgetting to input data or not sending the right documents to your partners , business EDI can streamline your business to ensure it runs smoother .
The best part about EDI is that it does n’t matter if your computer system is n’t compatible with your partners because EDI uses message standards to quickly communicate data .
How Does EDI Work ?
Almost all EDI systems use a software interface , which allows you to directly send and receive documents .
The program is run on both the sending and receiving computers , which ensure the efficient sending and receiving important information and documents .
An employee can enter the details into the system which will then create the document .
When the document is ready , it can then be accessed by the receiver .
For example , if you ’re creating an invoice or a purchase order then your employee will put in the details and once it is completed , the document will be sent to the recipient .
The process of EDI can help to speed up manual time - consuming tasks , such as inputting invoice data , uploading it onto your system , and then sending it .
By freeing up more time , you and your employees are able to get on with the real work .
How to Benefit From EDI
There are countless benefits of EDI that can help your business , no matter what industry you work in .
Due to their efficient nature , EDI systems can create shorter business cycles and optimize your business ’s communication .
1. Reduce Your Costs
EDI can help your business reduce its spending .
By automating documents and sending them to your partners and recipients , your business will save money on the cost of paper and the hours spent .
These costs add up and although you might not be aware of it , your business could be losing hundreds of dollars .
Once you ’ve made savings , this money can be spent elsewhere in your business .
Cutting down on the number of resources used , such as paper , can also help your business be more environmentally - friendly .
2. Boost Your Speed
EDI can help boost your speed , which not only leads to happier employees , it also leads to more satisfied customers and client .
Your employees are able to save time spent on mundane tasks and focus on what they ’re really good at .
While your customers and clients are able to receive confirmation and important documents quicker , which helps to build better relationships and loyalty .
Happier and more satisfied customers and clients are more likely to use your business in the future , so their experience is very important .
3. Be Error - Free
Manual data input can encounter errors , which can be costly for your business .
If you want an error - free , efficient business that is known for reliability and accuracy then you need to implement EDI .
By having no space for errors in your data , your business can also free up more time to spend on the important stuff .
For example , your employees might spend hours searching for documents in their emails or scrolling through documents trying to find errors , but with EDI this will all become a distant memory .
4. Improve Your Logistics
Logistic management is vital for any business .
To succeed as a business , you need a foolproof logistics management scheme that allows you to manage and control the production , purchases , and deliveries of your business .
EDI can help with just this .
Streamlining your data , documents , and transfers can help to improve your logistics .
Say goodbye to lost invoices or purchase orders and hello to effective , easy to track data .
Your documents will also all be in the same format as your partners and clients , which saves your accounting team from having to decode individual invoices and purchase orders .
5. Increase Your Productivity
EDI can help to increase your business ’s productivity levels .
By slicing the time it takes to send and receive data and documents , your employees will get less distracted .
It ’s always hard to concentrate on tasks that take long periods of time , but easier to focus in short bursts .
The data , which is found all in one place , can also be used by your employees to effortlessly check inventory and returns .
When a task is straightforward , your employees are more likely to stay focused and less likely to get things wrong .
Still not convinced that EDI is right for you ?
Then check out some more benefits of EDI .
Implement Electronic Data Interchange and Reap the EDI Benefits Now
There are so many EDI benefits that can positively impact the success of your business .
Implementing a simple time - saving tool such as EDI could n’t be any easier and yet it can really help to transform your business .
Do n’t waste any more time on mundane tasks by implementing EDI now .

TAMPA , Fla . —
The city of Tampa wo n’t be quick to forget the trial and conviction of extreme pornographer Paul Little , aka Max Hardcore , anytime soon .
Tampa Tribune columnist Daniel Ruth , known for his liberal views , has blogged in his column , Book of Ruth , on Hardcore being judged by a jury of his peers — the very peers who Ruth says gave an “ Oscar - winning performance ” during the trial .
In Ruth ’s blogpost today , the 59 - year - old radio show host exposed his lack of compassion for Hardcore and seemed to revel in the fact that while he deemed Hardcore “ a cheesy , déclassé opportunist more interested in profits than common decency , ” the 12 jurors who convicted Hardcore had the same lack of character .
Ruth was referring to the book deal that seemed to surface with astonishing speed minutes after Hardcore ’s conviction .
The St. Petersburg Times reported that the jurors planned to write a book about their jury service .
“ While the jury was supposed to be objectively pondering whether a man will spend many years in prison , they were entering into a potential business relationship the success of which could be determined by the outcome of the trial , ” Ruth said .
“ Uh , just where is the real obscenity here ?
Naughty movies ?
Or entrepreneurial jurors ? ”
Still , Ruth was quick to state what side he stands for when he wrote , “ This is the fate of someone who makes a living as , not only a pornographer , but also a purveyor of such depraved , sick , twisted ( and that 's just the opening credits ) material , it would make Larry Flynt look like Walt Disney . ”
California law prohibits jurors making a book deal until 90 days after they ’re dismissed from service , but Florida boasts no such law , which effectively allowed the Hardcore jurors to decide a verdict with the knowledge that a guilty verdict could lead to a lucrative book offer .
“ I am aware of no Florida statute which prevents jurors from profiting from their story about their jury duty , once the case is over , ” adult industry attorney Larry Walters told XBIZ .
FindLaw.com blogger and attorney Jonna M. Spilbor , who commented about various celebrity trials on her blog said , “ Today , especially when it comes to celebrity trials , or those that become celebrity trials , think Scott Peterson — he was a fertilizer salesman , remember — being selected for jury duty is almost like winning the lottery .
It leads to lucrative book deals .
Movie options .
All - expenses - paid interviews in exciting cities .
The post - trial moneymaking opportunities for celebrity - trial jurors abound .
And it's all perfectly legal — indeed , arguably protected by the First Amendment . ”
Spilbor is a legal analyst appearing regularly on MSNBC , CNN Headline News and Fox News Channel .
Members of the Hardcore jury included an accounts receivable clerk with three young children at home , a licensed practical nurse , an insurance claims adjuster and a civil engineer .
A pawnshop owner served as the jury foreman .
Jurors in the Max Hardcore obscenity returned a verdict of guilty on 10 federal counts of distributing obscene materials over the Internet and through the mail .
His company , MaxWorld Enterprises , was guilty on 10 related counts .
In an unrelated case , jury selection began yesterday in the trial of Stolen Cars Films and LA Media owner Ira Isaacs who faces multiple obscenity - related counts .
The first four obscenity - related counts are in connection with videos entitled “ Gang Bang Horse — ‘ Pony Sex Game , ’ ” “ Mako ’s First Time Scat , ” “ Hollywood Scat Amateurs No. 7 , ” and “ BAE 20 . ”
The indictment alleges that Isaacs shipped “ Hollywood Scat Amateurs No. 7 , ” and “ BAE 20 ” outside the state of California .
The prosecution is the first in Southern California by a Justice Department task force formed in 2005 after Christian conservative groups appealed to the Bush administration to regulate adult content .
Jurors will view hours of hardcore porn , just like in the Hardcore case .
Analysis
A paper published in scientific journal Nature this week has reignited the debate about Global Warming , by predicting that the earth wo n't be getting any warmer until 2015 .
Researchers at the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences have factored in cyclical oceanic into their climate model , and produced a different forecast to the " consensus " models which do n't .
But how will we know whether the earth is warming or cooling ?
Today , it all depends on the data source .
Two authorities provide us with analysis of long - term surface temperature trends .
Both agree on the global temperature trend until 1998 , at which time a sharp divergence occurred .
The UK Meteorological Office 's Hadley Center for Climate Studies Had -Crut data shows worldwide temperatures declining since 1998 .
According to Hadley 's data , the earth is not much warmer now than it was than it was in 1878 or 1941 .
Hadley 's data ( April 13 , 2008 )
By contrast , NASA data shows worldwide temperatures increasing at a record pace - and nearly a full degree warmer than 1880 .
NASA 's data ( April 13 , 2008 )
The other two widely used global temperature data sources are from earth - orbiting satellites UAH ( University of Alabama at Huntsville ) and RSS ( Remote Sensing Systems . )
Both show decreasing temperatures over the last decade , with present temperatures barely above the 30 year average .
Anomalies 1998 - 2008 ; University of Alabama ( UAH )
Anomalies 1998 - 2008 ; Remote Sensing Systems ( RSS )
Confusing ?
How can scientists who report measurements of the earth 's temperature within one one - hundredth of a degree be unable to concur if the temperature is going up or down over a ten year period ?
Something appears to be inconsistent with the NASA data - but what is it ?
One clue we can see is that NASA has been reworking recent temperatures upwards and older temperatures downwards - which creates a greater slope and the appearance of warming .
Canadian statistician Steve McIntyre has been tracking the changes closely on his Climate Audit site , and reports that NASA is Rewriting History , Time and Time Again .
The recent changes can be seen by comparing the NASA 1999 and 2007 US temperature graphs .
Below is the 1999 version , and below that is the reworked 2007 version .
NASA 's original data : 1999
NASA 's reworked data : 2007
In order to visualize the changes , I overlaid the 2007 version on top of the 1999 version , above , and a clear pattern emerged .
The pre-1970 temperatures have been nearly uniformly adjusted downwards ( red below green ) - and the post 1970 temperatures have been adjusted upwards ( red above green . )
Some of the yearly temperatures have been adjusted by as much as 0.5 degrees .
That is a huge total change for a country the size of the US with thousands of separate temperature records .
How could it be determined that so many thermometers were wrong by an average of 0.5 degrees in one particular year several decades ago , and an accurate retrofit be made ?
Why is the adjustment 0.5 degrees one year , and 0.1 degrees the next ?
Describing this more succinctly , the 2007 version of the data appears to have been sheared vertically across 1970 to create the appearance of a warming trend .
We can approximate shear by applying a small rotation , so I tried " un-rotating " the 2007 graph clockwise around 1970 until I got a reasonably good visual fit at six degrees .
GISS US Temperatures overlay
What could be the motivation for the recent changes ?
Further examination of the NASA site might give us a clue as to what is happening .
NASA staff have done some recent bookkeeping and refined the data from 1930 - 1999 .
The issues has been discussed extensively at science blog Climate Audit .
So what is the probability of this effort consistently increasing recent temperatures and decreasing older temperatures ?
From a statistical viewpoint , data recalculation should cause each year to have a 50/50 probability of going either up or down - thus the odds of all 70 adjusted years working in concert to increase the slope of the graph ( as seen in the combined version ) are an astronomical 2 raised to the power of 70 .
That is one - thousand - billion - billion to one .
This is n't an exact representation of the odds because for some of the years ( less than 15 ) the revisions went against the trend - but even a 55/15 split is about as likely as a room full of chimpanzees eventually typing Hamlet .
That would be equivalent to flipping a penny 70 times and having it come up heads 55 times .
It will never happen - one trillion to one odds ( 2 raised to the power 40 . )
( Authors note : Several readers have astutely pointed out that the probability calculation is incorrect .
A proper statistical calculation of coin toss probabilities shows greater than four sigma deviation - which places the odds of a random 55 /15 distribution at closer to " one out a million , " rather than " one out of a trillion " as originally reported . )
Particularly troubling are the years from 1986 - 1998 .
In the 2007 version of the graph , the 1986 data was adjusted upwards by 0.4 degrees relative to the 1999 graph .
In fact , every year except one from 1986 - 1998 was adjusted upwards , by an average of 0.2 degrees .
If someone wanted to present a case for a lot of recent warming , adjusting data upwards would be an excellent way to do it .
Looking at the NASA website , we can see that the person in charge of the temperature data is the eminent Dr. James Hansen - Al Gore 's science advisor and the world 's leading long - term advocate of global warming .
Data Sources
NASA and Had - Crut data are largely based on surface measurements , using thermometers .
They both face a lot of difficulties due to contaminated data caused by urban heating effects , disproportionate concentration of thermometers in urban areas , changes in thermometer types over time , changes in station locations , loss of stations , changes in the time of day when thermometers are read , and yet more factors .
NASA has a very small number of long - term stations in the Arctic , and even fewer in Africa and South America .
The data has been systematically adjusted upwards in recent years - as can be seen in this graph , reproduced below .
Temperatures from the years 1990 to present have more than one - half degree Fahrenheit artificially added on to them - which may account for most of the upwards trend in the NASA temperature set .
Official difference between the publicly reported temperature and the original data from USHCN / NASA - click to enlarge
Satellite temperature data ( UAH and RSS ) is more reliable because it covers the entire earth - with the exception of small regions near the north and south poles .
They use the same methodology from year to year , and the two sources tend to agree fairly closely .
The downside of satellite data is that it only goes back to 1978 .
Now back to the present .
The Los Angeles city attorney ’s office plans to sue Time Warner Cable Inc. today , alleging that the company caused “ major havoc and distress ” when it became the No. 1 pay TV provider in Southern California two years ago .
City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo said Wednesday that Time Warner violated state law by making false and misleading statements to subscribers .
The 25 - page lawsuit , a copy of which was reviewed by The Times , claims the company violated its franchise agreement with the city by having subscribers spend hours on hold with customer service representatives and allowing excessive repair work delays .
“ Hundreds of thousands of Los Angeles residents were ripped off , ” Delgadillo said in a statement .
“ Time Warner must be held accountable for its promises . ”
City prosecutors said the suit would be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court .

Time Warner Cable representatives had no immediate comment .
The New York - based company could face civil penalties of tens of millions of dollars .
Delgadillo ’s office has taken corporate interests to court several times , suing local hospitals on allegations that they dumped indigent patients in downtown Los Angeles and accusing Anthem Blue Cross of scheming to cancel health insurance for people diagnosed with serious and expensive medical conditions .
Time Warner became the major cable TV provider in the area when it joined with Comcast Corp. in 2006 to buy out bankrupt Adelphia Communications Corp .
Time Warner and Comcast then swapped franchises so each would dominate markets in different U.S. regions .
Advertisement
The combination was difficult because Time Warner Cable had to upgrade the old Adelphia and Comcast systems and merge them with its own .
Nearly 500,000 subscribers in the city were affected .
In the suit , which focuses on service from the fall of 2006 to the spring of 2007 , city prosecutors cite brochures and television advertisements that they say gave the false impression that pricing for cable and Internet services would stay the same .
The suit says the company failed to live up to its part of the franchise cable agreement requiring that a company answer subscribers ’ calls within 30 seconds and begin repairs of service interruptions within 24 hours of notification in 90 % of its calls for service .
The suit claims that no more than 60 % of customer service calls were answered in time .
Service also was sub-par , the suit says , quoting a brochure saying that if a customer needed a service appointment , technicians would “ fix the problem fast . ”
Instead , technicians failed to show up on time to appointments to fix outages , the suit says .

Cable and Internet service “ was so intermittent and inferior in quality that it was not much better than no service at all , ” the suit says .

Shia gunman packs away his gun as Hezbollah orders withdrawal Hezbollah has agreed to withdraw its gunmen from Beirut after the Lebanese army settled tensions between the Shia group and armed government supporters .
The army revoked two key government measures that had led to four days of street fighting between the two sides , leaving at least 37 people dead .
Hezbollah had seized large parts of the city , but said it was now handing control back to the army .
But it has vowed to continue civil disobedience until its demands are met .
A Hezbollah statement said : " The Lebanese opposition will end all armed presence in Beirut so that the capital will be in the hands of the army . "
Funeral shootings
The fighting was sparked by a government move to shut down Hezbollah 's telecoms network and the removal of the chief of security at Beirut airport for alleged Hezbollah sympathies .
High stakes of Lebanon 's crisis
In pictures : Battle for Beirut
Those decisions were referred to the army which shelved them , and called on all parties to return to the status quo before the fighting .
The BBC's Jim Muir , in Beirut , says the army 's proposals offer a face - saving compromise that allows the government to back down .
He says the streets are expected to be calmer and the international airport is likely to reopen .
Earlier , Prime Minister Fouad Siniora called on the army to restore law and order , saying the country would not fall to Hezbollah after four days of street battles which saw the Shia movement drive supporters of the government out of western Beirut .
In his first response to Hezbollah 's de facto takeover of the west of the capital , Mr Siniora said his government would never declare war against the Shia group .
Also on Saturday , at least two people were killed after gunfire broke out during a funeral in a Sunni area of Beirut when unidentified gunmen targeted the funeral procession of a Sunni civilian killed during clashes on Friday .

The spiral of unrest has sparked memories of Lebanon 's bitter , 15 - year civil war .
Leaders of Lebanon 's rival political factions were due to meet on Saturday and the Arab League will hold talks about the crisis on Sunday .
TV station closed Hezbollah militants had earlier withdrawn from the streets of Beirut having crushed resistance by Sunni gunmen loyal to Mr Siniora 's government .
In the areas of Beirut worst affected by battles between Hezbollah and pro-government loyalists , barricades that had been set up were abandoned early on Saturday , said the BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut .
But the TV station run by Sunni leader Saad Hariri is still off the air after gunmen forced its closure on Friday , he added .
In northern Lebanon , at least 10 gunmen were killed when pro-government activists stormed the office of a Hezbollah - allied party in northern Lebanon , reports said .
Gunmen loyal to Mr Hariri set ablaze the office of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party in the village of Halba , after the gun battle .
Lebanon was plunged into civil war from 1975 - 90 , drawing in Syria and Israel , the two regional powers .
The latest violence amounts to a humiliating blow to the government , which appears to have badly overplayed its hand in moving to close Hezbollah 's telecoms network on Tuesday , our correspondent says .

Richard Esguerra from the Electronic Frontier Foundation sez ,
After weeks of empty rhetoric about coming to a " compromise " on new spying laws , the House of Representatives is set to vote on telecom immunity tomorrow .
The bill is HR 6304 and contains the exact same blanket immunity provisions , only with a few cosmetic changes so that political spin doctors can claim that it actually provides meaningful court review .
Whether or not Congress decides to offer immunity for telecoms that cooperated in warrantless spying programs is a key part of the broader battle over the Bush Administration 's legal doctrine of unchecked executive power .
If you live in the US , please visit stopthespying.org , find your Representative 's phone number in Washington D.C. , and tell them to oppose immunity for lawbreaking telecoms !
How badly did Expelled do on opening weekend ?
The weekend is n’t over yet , but it is possible to extrapolate based on Friday ’s receipts .
Things do n’t look too good .
[ Insert your own “ Expelled from the box office ” joke here . ]
… Playing in 1,052 theaters , the pic distributed by Rocky Mountain Pictures earned $ 1.2M Friday for what should be a $ 3.4 M weekend .
But the per screen average for Friday was a feeble $ 1,130 … showing there was n’t any pent - up demand for the film despite an aggressive publicity campaign .
So much for the conservative argument that people would flock to films not representing the “ agenda of liberal Hollywood ” …
Nikki
Finke , the writer of that piece , compares the movie to Michael Moore ‘s documentary , Sicko — it made relatively more money from fewer theaters on its opening weekend .
That seems like an unfair comparison , as Moore already had a reputation as a film - maker .
Though he was a speechwriter for President Nixon , I doubt most people know anything about Ben Stein ‘s political / scientific views .
These may not be fair comparisons either , but they ’re first - time documentaries headlined by a well - known or semi - well - known person .
Morgan Spurlock ‘s Super Size
Me had a $ 12,601 per - theater opening weekend average from 41 theaters .
It made $ 516,641 that weekend .
Al Gore‘s An Inconvenient Truth had a $ 70,332 per - theater opening weekend average from 4 theaters .
It made $ 281,330 that weekend .
Michael Moore ‘s Roger and Me had a $ 20,063 per - theater opening weekend average from 4 theaters .
It made $ 80,253 that weekend .
I can just imagine producer Mark Mathis and friends coming up with ways to spin this :
“ The movie theaters of America are just trying to suppress anti-Evolution voices , ” they ’ll say .
You can see how Expelled fared in the box office this weekend here .

Vatican to Check U.S. Seminaries on Gay Presence ( NYT )
Excerpt : " Investigators appointed by the Vatican have been instructed to review each of the 229 Roman Catholic seminaries in the United States for " evidence of homosexuality " and for faculty members who dissent from church teaching ... The Vatican document surfaces as Catholics await a Vatican ruling on whether homosexuals should be barred from the priesthood .
" In a possible indication of the ruling 's contents , the American archbishop who is supervising the seminary review said last week that " anyone who has engaged in homosexual activity or has strong homosexual inclinations , " should not be admitted to a seminary .
Edwin O'Brien , archbishop for the United States military , told The National Catholic Register that the restriction should apply even to those who have not been sexually active for a decade or more .... "
Google is keeping Amazon.com on its toes .
The company launched an application - hosting service in preview today , called Google App Engine , which competes directly with an offering from Amazon.com .
And although the service is , for the moment , somewhat basic , it already has some key advantages over Amazon , according to Gartner analyst Ray Valdez .
" Developers can collaborate [ on the platform ] , and you 've got a management system that lets you see how your app is doing in real time , " Valdez says .
The downside ?
There are limitations .
" You can't do more than 65,000 http requests and you can only do 2,000 e-mails a day , " Valdez says .
Google readily concedes it 's still primitive .
" We 've got a lot left to do , and there are a lot of features we still want to add to the system , " wrote Kevin Gibbs , the tech lead on Google App Engine on the official Google blog .
For the preview release , applications have to be implemented using the Python programming language , but Google says it looks forward to " supporting more languages in the future . "
And in a typically Googlesque move , developers who signed up as early as last night were given a message that there was no more space left .
" I signed up last night and was given a message that there was no more room , but maybe 30 minutes later my invitation showed up – I guess they 're just playing with our emotions , " says Ian Bicking , a Chicago - based web developer .
The pricing also remains undetermined .
Since the service will likely be targeted to small - and medium - sized businesses , which tend to be price sensitive , pricing could be critical .
Right now , it 's free for the first 10,000 developers who sign up , and the company says it will always be free to start .
" Developers will be able to purchase additional computing resources as needed , but Google App Engine will always be free to get started , " Gibbs wrote .
Valdez argues , however , that people who use web - based hosting services are n't looking for a bargain as much as they 're looking for convenience .
" If you 're really price sensitive , you 'll go to a hosting company .
I had someone calculate it .
Amazon.com is actually not the cheapest , but the value is that you do n't have to worry about administering the system , " Valdez says .
" The people who will find [ Google App Engine ] attractive are those who have low - to mid-size requirements and who are willing to accept the fact that their data will be stored in the clouds , and a lot of Fortune 500 companies are not comfortable with that . "

Dem congressman calls on McClellan to testify about book ’s revelations
Nick Juliano
Already getting grief from his former White House colleagues , former Bush spokesman Scott McClellan is now being asked to testify before Congress about the revelations contained in his scathing new memoir .
Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , a key Bush antagonist and member of the House Judiciary Committee , says McClellan needs to tell Congress the full story about potential White House conspiring around the leak of a CIA officer ’s name and propaganda efforts that preceded the invasion of Iraq .
Wexler released a statement Wednesday calling for McClellan to tesitfy under oath before the Judiciary committee .
“ The admissions made by Scott McClellan in his new book are earth - shattering and allege facts to establish that Karl Rove and Scooter Libby “ “ and possibly Vice President Cheney – conspired to obstruct justice by lying about their role in the Plame Wilson matter and that the Bush Administration deliberately lied to the American people in order to take us to war in Iraq , ” Wexler said .
“ Scott McClellan must now appear before the House Judiciary Committee under oath to tell Congress and the American people how President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , Karl Rove , Scooter Libby , and White House officials deliberately orchestrated a massive propaganda campaign to sell the war in Iraq to the American people .
“ The allegations by this former top White House aide “ “ that Rove and Libby deliberately coordinated their stories in order to obstruct justice in the Plame case , that the President deliberately disregarded contradictory evidence related to Iraq , should outrage every American and Congress must respond by initiating immediate aggressive oversight starting with an appearance by McClellan before the House Judiciary Committee , ” he continued .
“ Any continued obstruction by this Administration to prevent White House officials from appearing before Congress cannot be tolerated by this Congress in the face of these shocking revelations . ” 

ieri in uno dei miei innumerevoli indirizzi di posta elettronica apro e trovo una mail di una vecchia compagna di salsa e singletudine .
Una di quelle che , lo dico senza ombra di critica , una volta fidanzata dirada le serate salsere fino a sparire , presa da nuovi impegni e interessi , affacendata in un turbinio di emozioni , coccole e poi convivenza e poi …
A maggio avrei dovuto sposarmi .
Ma lui a metà febbraio circa , non mi chiedere di preciso perchè , ad una mia semplice domanda ( c’era qualcosa che non mi era del tutto chiaro sul nostro rapporto ) , mi dice che con tutti questi dubbi che io gli ho messo non ha più alcuna intenzione di sposarsi .
Quindi storia chiusa e tutto saltato !
Ma dico a ’ sto qui non poteva venirgli un infarto ?
Per carità ti può persino capitare di peggio !
Tipo essere abbandonate direttamente sull ’altare !
Ooops ma questa è un’altra storia , e non è detto che la protagonista sia una donna , si sa ci sono anche i sommersi oltre che gli sposati !
Sharepoint 2007 – insanely bad HTML
Sharepoint 2007 continues to amaze me with its terrible interface code .
This is code you stumble over all over the place , both in places where you can hack your way around them , and in places where you just have to live with them .
Some things are very hard to live with , let me show you :
ASP.NET developers made a decision once to include some hidden form fields , called viewstate , on all aspx pages .
When deciding how to include those fields they chose an input with the type set to hidden .
When the Sharepoint developers wanted to do something similar they decided on another route :
< input type = " text " name = " __spDummyText1 " style = " display : none ; " size = 1 / > < input type = " text " name = " __spDummyText2 " style = " display : none ; " size = 1 / >
So we have a visible textbox , hidden with CSS , that has a size of 1 character .
No wait , we have two textboxes and they both have very descriptive names ( NOT ) .
What the heck were they thinking ?
Why not type =" hidden " , and remove size ?
Or , I know , do n't add them at all , they are only dummy right ?
Note that they are empty .
Another strange interface decision is the one to include a skiplink in the page .
Skip links are links that help screen readers ( and others ) to navigate to important areas quickly .
There 's many different ways to implement them , here 's the Sharepoint way :
< A href = " javascript : ; " onclick = " javascript : this.href= ' # mainContent ' ; " class = " ms-skip " >
The .ms - skip class positions it far off screen to the left , and the javascript … wait , javascript on a skip link ?
Why on earth did they not add #mainContent to the href attribute directly ?
Only they know …
Next in this post is a more philosophical piece of HTML .
Look at this :
< span dir = " none " >< table ... > ... </ table > </ span >
I 've heard about setting text direction to rtl ( right to left ) , and ltr ( left to right , for some eastern languages ) , but never to none .
Where do text go that has no direction ?
Inwards ?
And what about having a table inside a span element ?
ASP.NET also have user controls , a way to abstract out important pieces of code , to make reuse easy .
Sharepoint of course uses this convenient tool regularly , and comes with a couple of useful ones :
< SharePoint : SPRememberScroll runat = " server " id = " TreeViewRememberScroll " onscroll = " javascript:_spRecordScrollPositions ( this ) ; " Style = " overflow : auto ; height : 400 px ; width : 150 px ; " > ...
In the documentation for SPRememberScroll you can learn … absolutely nothing about it .
It seems to strangely interact with a TreeView somehow , and even worse , it has a width and height !
I guess it 's good that it 's separate from the TreeView itself , so we can remove it from there if we want to forget where we 've scrolled to .
What ?
Sharepoint 2007 , note the year there , also both have the classical spacer gif and a new one ; the spacer span :
Spacer gif : < td width = " 4 px " >< IMG SRC = " / _layouts/images/blank.gif " width = 4 height = 1 alt = " " ></ td >
Spacer span : < span style = " width : 3 px ; height : 5 px ; " > </ span >
Starting with the spacer gif : Luckily they have their width set twice , both on the image and the cell .
Note the " 4 px " there , you can't use CSS units when you 're writing HTML , HTML only knows about pixels .
You 're glad you wrote the width twice now , right ?
The spacer span is a fairly new thing I guess , the strange thing here is that you can't set a width and height on inline elements .
It just does n't work , sorry .
If you 've built your user controls really bad , you might need a way to let people customize its HTML to make sense .
Sharepoint has a couple of different ways to do this , one that they use themselves like this :
< SharePoint : DelegateControl runat = " server " Control Id = " PublishingConsole " PrefixHtml = " < tr > < td colspan= " 4 " id = " mpdmconsole " class = " ms-consolemptablerow " > " SuffixHtml= " </ td ></ tr > ">
If you manage to read that , you can see that they are injecting a table row somewhere inside their control ( which of course generates a table ) .
Is it just me that feels the urge to add an ending table tag to SuffixHtml just to see what happens ?
Another truly interesting interface construct is the datepicker .
It 's one of these ordinary little calendar icons that opens in a little box and lets you pick a date .
How did the Sharepoint guys ( or girls ) implement that ?
< ...A href = " # " onclick = ' clickDatePicker ( < long id here > , < long url here > , " " ) ; return false ; ' > < IMG src = " / _layouts/images/calendar.gif " border = " 0 " alt = " Select a date from the calendar . " > </ IMG ></ A ></ td > < IFRAME SRC = " / _layouts/images/blank.gif " FRAMEBORDER = 0 SCROLLING = no style = " DISPLAY : none ; POSITION : absolute ; width :200 px ; Z - INDEX:101 ; " title = " Select a date from the calendar . " ></ IFRAME > < td > ...
Ok , lots of code to analyse here , and I 've still only cut out the middle of a couple of nested tables .
A link with an onclick that opens the datepicker is fairly standard , all parameters needed are encoded into a long url sent to that method .
There 's an image to click , with a strange img ending tag , but that could have been a mistake .
The strange thing here is the iframe that points to a blank image .
It 's inserted into a table right between two cells ( yes , you read that right ) .
That 's just insane .
If you for some sensational reason have to use an iframe to display some HTML , output it javascript instead of just setting the src with js .
Seriously people .
Nice accessibility feature though , to have the alt text both on the image and on the iframe .
Twice as accessible !
Another not - so - fine interface implementation is the following :
They want to show a heading and a list of links .
Personally , I would have used a heading tag , and an ul with links in .
Sharepoint does it like this :
< div style = " margin - left : 4 px ; " > < div class = " level - header " >< span id = " header " class = " headertitle " > Division </ span ></ div >
< div class = " level - item - pos level - item level - bullet " >< span id = " header " > < a href = " < url > " > Information Technology </ a ></ span ></ div >
< div class = " level - item - pos level - item level - bullet " >< span id = " header " > < a href = " < url > " > Research & Development </ a ></ span ></ div > ...
They break their own scheme of prefixing all their classes with " ms - " ( something that severely messed up my header ) , they repeat ids , they use only divs and spans , and inline styles .
Do I need to say more ?

10 October 2001 -- Since the appalling acts of mass murder in New York and Washington on September 11 , 2001 , US President George Bush has at times sounded like a fire - and - brimstone preacher .
With home - spun , Bible - inspired homilies , Bush has warned that the “ evil - doers ” — Osama bin Laden and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan that shelters him — will pay for their sins .
However , Bush has avoided the most pertinent and illuminating Biblical phrase to explain those terrible events : “ You reap what you sow ” .
The seeds of what became the Taliban were sown by Washington itself in the rugged mountains and deep valleys of Afghanistan and the badlands of the Pakistan - Afghanistan border region .
In 1978 , the left - wing , secular Peoples Democratic Party ( PDPA ) took power in Afghanistan .
Fearing the radical reforms being implemented there would inspire similar demands from the peoples of the region , Washington immediately moved to arm and train counter - revolutionaries — the mujaheddin — organised by Afghanistan 's wealthy landlords and its Muslim religious establishment .
When thousands of Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to defend the besieged PDPA government , Washington stepped up its support for the “ freedom fighters ” ( in the Orwellian words of US President Ronald Reagan in 1985 ) .
Fundamentalism
Between 1978 and 1992 , the US government poured at least US $ 6 billion into the mujaheddin factions .
Other governments — including Britain , France , China and Iran — also provided arms and funding .
Israel even sent rifles , tanks and artillery guns captured during its frequent wars against Arab states .
By 1987 , 65,000 tons of weaponry had been being supplied by the US each year .
The oil - rich Saudi Arabian monarchy — which was also committed to spreading an extremely anti-democratic form of Islam known as Wahhabism — matched US contributions to the mujaheddin dollar for dollar .
The US plan was enthusiastically embraced by Pakistan military dictator General Zia ul Haq .
Zia also promoted state - sponsored Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan .
Washington knowingly ignored Pakistan 's progress towards the development of nuclear weapons in this period .
Washington and Saudi Arabia funnelled the vast bulk of the assistance through the Zia dictatorship 's secret police , the Inter - Service Intelligence Directorate ( ISI ) .
The most fundamentalist mujaheddin factions received the lion 's share of arms and funds — with Washington 's full knowledge and support .
In 1986 , the CIA agreed to cooperate with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to expand an international network for the recruitment of foreign Muslim fanatics to join the mujaheddin .
These recruits were primarily drawn from the Arab countries and Pakistan , but some travelled from central and south - east Asia , Africa and North Africa .
In Pakistan , the ISI — through the Maktab al Khidamat ( Office of Services ) operated by bin Laden — allocated the recruits and distributed CIA and Saudi money and US - supplied arms to the mujaheddin factions .
With CIA funds , the ISI built camps for the “ trainees ” inside Afghanistan .
The Pakistan and Saudi state - sponsored religious sects provided “ ideological ” instruction .
The CIA and the British SAS provided training in urban terrorism and guerilla warfare .
The ISI provided training inside Afghanistan .
( The ISI trainers had learnt their craft from US army and navy elite forces in US training facilities ) .
Mass training of mujaheddin fighters was also conducted by the Pakistan army 's elite Special Services Group .
Pakistan 's current military ruler , General Pervez Musharraf , spent seven years with the SSG and was involved in training the anti-PDPA contras .
According to the July 19 , 1992 , Washington Post , a “ ceaseless stream ” of CIA and Pentagon specialists had travelled to the ISI 's head office in Pakistan to coordinate the training and operations of the mujaheddin .
An estimated 100,000 foreign Islamic militants flocked to the border region in Pakistan between 1982 and 1992 .
They joined another 120,000 or so Pakistani anti-communist religious fanatics and desperate Afghan refugees who were enrolled in 2500 Saudi - funded fundamentalist madrassahs ( mosque schools ) controlled by Pakistan 's state - sponsored Islamic parties .
There they were indoctrinated with a brand of Islam inspired by the Wahhabi sect of the Saudi rulers .
Some 35,000 foreigners and tens of thousands of Pakistanis and Afghans were selected from these schools for training by the CIA and ISI to fight for the mujaheddin .
All this shaped the most extreme mujaheddin factions , including that of Mullah Mohammed Omar , who later emerged as the Taliban 's supreme leader .
On February 15 , 1989 , the last Soviet troops left Afghanistan .
However , the mujaheddin was unable to dislodge the PDPA government for another three years .
The PDPA government finally fell in April 1992 because Moscow had stopped providing it with military aid as part of a compromise with Washington .
Thieves fall out
With the demise of the Soviet Union and the fall of the PDPA government , Washington 's interest in developments in Afghanistan waned .
The brutal mujaheddin bandits had served their purpose as far as the US was concerned .
The CIA left the job of managing the mujaheddin to the ISI .
While covert US funding for the mujaheddin officially ended in 1992 , the contra factions retained huge stockpiles of US - supplied arms — including hundreds of US - and British - supplied surface - to - air missiles .
Nor were they short of funds .
Since 1979 , the US had turned a blind eye to the mujaheddin 's massive opium trafficking and smuggling rackets , which the contras had developed in collaboration with senior officers of the Pakistan military , the ISI and Pakistan - based mafia .
The mujaheddin training camps established by the CIA and ISI continued to operate ; the ISI continued to provide military and ideological training to Islamic fundamentalists from around the world ( five ISI officers were killed in the 1998 US missile attacks on training camps in Afghanistan ) .
Foreign Afghan war veterans , and recruits who continued to arrive , were now being sent by the ISI to fight in the Kashmir civil war .
Thousands of others fanned across the world and put their CIA - perfected skills to use in a range of conflicts and terrorist acts .
Inside Afghanistan , after the mujaheddin took Kabul in 1992 , the warlords had soon turned on one another .
The country was carved up into warring fiefdoms .
Kabul was ruled by a succession of mujaheddin factions .
Their opponents rained mortar bombs and rockets on the city , killing thousands .
Rival armies routinely robbed , raped and murdered civilians .
Frustrated at the internecine squabbling , the Pakistani military withdrew support from the existing mujaheddin factions and sponsored its own , the Taliban movement , founded in 1994 .
At first , many Afghans welcomed the new fighters in the hope that they would reject the brutality and corruption of their predecessors .
They were to be tragically disappointed .
With Islamabad 's assistance , the Taliban rapidly acquired an army of 25,000 troops , equipped with sophisticated weaponry .
Most of these fighters were drawn from the thousands of foreign militants , the tens of thousands of poor Pakistanis and Afghan refugees enrolled in Pakistan 's madrassahs , hence the name Taliban ( meaning “ students ” ) .
Jane 's Defence Weekly in November 1996 estimated that “ half of [ the ] Taliban 's manpower and equipment originates in Pakistan under the ISI ” .
Significant numbers of Pakistan army “ volunteers ” bolstered the Taliban forces .
According to Ahmed Rashid , the respected correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review and author of Taliban : Islam , Oil and the New Great Game in Central Asia ( Yale University Press ) , between 1994 and 1997 Washington “ quietly allowed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to back the Taliban ” and welcomed its victory in September 1996 .
( According to Robert Fisk , writing in the September 26 British Independent , Saudi Arabia 's patronage of the Taliban was overseen by Prince Turki bin Feisel al Saud , head of the Saudi Arabian secret service until he was sacked less than a month before the Saudi government officially severed its diplomatic links with the Taliban on September 25 .
Turki was known to be an unrepentant supporter of bin Laden . )
In what Rashid describes as “ romancing the Taliban ” , US economic interests took precedence over human rights concerns .
The US kept mum about the Taliban 's institutionalised brutality — especially against women — and its massacres of ethnic and Shiite minorities .
The Taliban 's massive drug running operations were barely mentioned .
The US government had hopes that gas and oil pipelines , worth US $ 4.5 billion , from the former Soviet Central Asian republic of Turkmenia to the Arabian Sea via Afghanistan and Pakistan would be constructed if the Taliban ’s control of Afghanistan could end the civil war .
The US oil company Unocal and Saudi - based Delta Oil had already sewn up a US $ 2 billion deal with the Taliban for one of the projects to proceed .
( Unocal pulled out of the consortium in December 1998 , citing “ turmoil ” in Afghanistan . )
Washington believed the Taliban promised the best chance of “ stability ” for the strategically important region .
Rashid added that Washington also considered the Taliban “ as a convenient foil for Iranian influence in Central Asia ” .
The US rulers were also keen to enlist the Taliban 's influence to rein in the Islamic militants who had been given sanctuary in Afghanistan by it and the ISI , especially those dedicated to overthrowing strategic oil - rich Arab and Central Asian states and US allies .
Only in 1998 did Washington turn against the Taliban regime — with a barrage of 70 or so cruise missiles — because the Taliban refused to control the Islamic fundamentalists it was sheltering within Afghanistan 's borders , the most notorious being bin Laden .
The sudden demotion of Osama bin Laden from “ freedom fighter ” in the 1980s to “ terrorist mastermind ” in late 1990s had little to do with the rash of terrorist deeds he began to be accused of at that time .
Washington needed to demonise its Islamic fundamentalist Frankenstein monster , which had become a serious threat to its interests in the Middle East and Central Asia .
Oil
The US — as it did 11 years ago before the Gulf War — is mobilising a massive military force to attack a Third World country .
The US rulers are not primarily responding to the September 11 mass murders — although that provides a useful justification — just as the 1990 - 91 US response to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Kuwait had little to do with defending the rights of small states .
Behind all the US rulers ' pious condemnations of terrorism and crocodile tears for the 6000 victims of the September 11 attacks , the real goal of a US attack on Afghanistan will be the same as that of the Gulf War : the US rulers ’ need to maintain their military and political domination over the oil - rich states of the Middle East and Persian Gulf .
Control over the oil of the former Soviet Central Asian states is also a new and increasingly important factor in US policy .
Addressing a conference in December 1996 , then deputy director
for intelligence at the CIA , John C. Gannon , was candid : “ The area of the world where energy supplies are most abundant and at the same time most vulnerable is the Persian Gulf ...
As a consequence , the US will need to ... remain engaged in the Persian Gulf to safeguard the flow of vital oil supplies ...
There 's no room to be complacent .
It was six years ago that the United States and its allies were building up the forces and collectively spending more than $ 60 billion to ensure the security of oil supplies in the Gulf . ”
“ Energy security ” , as ruling - class pundits refer to US control of the world 's oil supply , is becoming a greater problem .
The developed capitalist countries are becoming more dependent on Middle Eastern oil , not less .
An economic recession makes the US capitalist rulers ’ desire to keep and extend their control of the world 's main oil reserves even more essential .
Central to US political domination of the Middle East is the existence of the imperialist colonial - settler state of Israel — Washington 's key ally in the region — and the pro-US regimes in Saudi Arabia , the Gulf states , Egypt and Jordan .
Bin Laden only became a “ terrorist ” in US propaganda when he fell out with the Saudi royal family and called for the overthrow of Washington 's Middle Eastern client states .
The Taliban 's Afghanistan only became a “ rogue state ” when it did not follow Washington 's orders to put a brake on the movement of religious fanatics , that the CIA helped create , which is bent on
driving the US out of the Muslim world .
Former media baron Conrad Black has asked for an emergency delay to the start of his 6 ½ - year prison sentence pending the outcome of his appeal .
Conrad Black , seen here in Chicago in December 2007 , is due to start his jail sentence March 3 . ( ( Jerry Lai / Associated Press ) )
Lawyers for Black , who was convicted of fraud and obstruction of justice last year , filed an emergency appeal on Wednesday asking a U.S. Appeal Court to allow him to remain free on bond .
The motion also includes Black 's two co-defendants , former Hollinger executives Peter Atkinson and John Boultbee .
The three are due to start their sentences March 3 .
" A brief delay of applicants ' surrender date until after this court rules on the application does not prejudice any party or undermine the goals of the justice system , " said the five - page motion .
Last July , Black was convicted of fraud and obstruction of justice related to the diversion of millions of dollars from Hollinger International .
The obstruction of justice conviction related to the improper removal of 13 boxes of documents from Black 's office .
Boultbee was given 27 months in jail ; Atkinson got 24 months .
Both were convicted of three counts of fraud .
Trial Judge Amy St. Eve has already refused to grant Black an appeal bond .
Such bonds are only rarely granted .
Federal prosecutors are due to file their reply to Black 's request on Feb. 25 .
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s deployment of extra troops in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia has brought the prospect of war “ very close ” , a minister of ex-Soviet Georgia said on Tuesday .

Separately , in comments certain to fan rising tension between Moscow and Tbilisi , the “ foreign minister ” of the breakaway Black Sea region was quoted as saying it was ready to hand over military control to Russia .
“ We literally have to avert war , ” Temur Iakobashvili , a Georgian State Minister , told reporters in Brussels .
Asked how close to such a war the situation was , he replied : “ Very close , because we know Russians very well . ”
“ We know what the signals are when you see propaganda waged against Georgia .
We see Russian troops entering our territories on the basis of false information , ” he said .
At a banking event in Madrid , Vice Finance Minister Dimitri Gvindadze said the Georgian economy was holding up despite the tensions .
However ratings agency Fitch said a conflict would likely hit Georgia ’s ratings but not immediately Russia’s .
“ Obviously if we have an unfreezing of the conflict that will be extremely negative for the country ( Georgia ) and would lead to negative ratings action , ” Fitch ’s Edward Parker told Reuters in London .
Georgia , a vital energy transit route in the Caucasus region , has angered Russia , its former Soviet master with which it shares a land border , by seeking NATO membership .
Russia has said its troop build - up is needed to counter what it says are Georgian plans to attack Abkhazia , a sliver of land by the Black Sea , and has accused Tbilisi of trying to suck the West into a war -- allegations Georgia rejects .
Tensions have been steadily mounting and escalated after Georgia accused Russia of shooting down one of its drones over Abkhazia in April , a claim Russia denied .
An extra Russian contingent began arriving in Abkhazia last week .
Moscow has not said how many troops would be added but said the total would remain within the 3,000 limit allowed under a United Nations - brokered ceasefire agreement signed in 1994 .
Diplomats expect the reinforcement to be of the order of 1,200 .
SECURITY GUARANTEES
Russian soldiers acting as peacekeepers patrol areas between Georgian and Abkhazian forces but handing full military control of the breakaway province to the Kremlin would alarm both the Georgian government and its allies in the West .

“ Those 200 km ( 120 miles ) , the distance between the Psou and the Inguri rivers , are all Abkhazia .
We agree to Russia taking this territory under its military control , ” Sergei Shamba , “ foreign minister ” of Abkhazia , told Russian newspaper Izvestia .
“ In exchange , we will demand guarantees of our security . ”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had not received an official request from Abkhazia for its military to take control of the region .
Iakobashvili urged EU states to take a more active role in the region , with options including the deployment of border monitors or a police mission .
Diplomats said EU President Slovenia was studying sending a delegation at the level of state secretaries to Georgia as a gesture of solidarity , but a number of ex-communist EU states were insisting it should be a full - fledged ministerial visit .
Antarctica has n’t warmed as much over the last century as climate models had originally predicted , a new study finds .
Climate change 's effects on Antarctica are of particular interest because of the substantial amount of water locked up in its ice sheets .
Should that water begin to melt , sea levels around the globe could rise and inundate low - lying coastal areas .
The new study , detailed in the April 5 issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters , marks the first time that researchers have been able to give a progress report on Antarctic climate model projections by comparing climate records to model simulations ( these comparisons have been done for the other six continents ) .
Information about Antarctica 's harsh weather patterns has traditionally been limited , but temperature records from ice cores and ground weather stations have recently been constructed , giving scientists the missing information they needed .
" This is a really important exercise for these climate models , " said study leader Andrew Monaghan of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Co. Temperature gap Monaghan and his team found that while climate models projected temperature increases of 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.75 degrees Celsius ) over the past century , temperatures were observed to have risen by only 0.4 F ( 0.2 C ) .
" This is showing us that , over the past century , most of Antarctica has not undergone the fairly dramatic warming that has affected the rest of the globe , " Monaghan said .
The gap between prediction and reality seemed to be caused by the models overestimating the amount of water vapor in the Antarctic atmosphere .
The cold air over the southernmost continent handles moisture differently than the atmosphere over warmer regions .
The models did , however , correctly capture the increases in snowfall over Antarctica in the late 20th century , followed by a decrease in the last decade .
One reason that Antarctica has n't warmed as much as other parts of the globe is the existence of the ozone hole overhead :
It alters wind patterns , creating a swirling belt of winds around the landmass that keeps comparatively warm air from seeping in , preserving the continent 's frigid temperatures .
One important exception to this rule is the Antarctic Peninsula , which has warmed by several degrees , in part because winds there draw in warmer air from the north .
Mixed verdict
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that sea levels could rise by 7 to 23 inches ( 18 to 59 centimeters ) globally this century , in part due to ice melt at the poles and from mountain glaciers .
The new study , funded by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy , suggests that warming in Antarctica could offset this amount by about 2 inches ( 5 centimeters ) if the continent warms by 5.4 F ( 3 C ) , as warmer air would hold more moisture and generate more snowfall , which contributes to the growth of the ice sheets , locking up any additional water in the these large masses of ice .
That would mean a rise of only 5 to 21 inches ( 13 to 54 centimenters ) .
But these projections are by no means certain — if melt from Antarctic ice sheets outweighed the snowfall that contributes to their growth , sea level rise could be higher .
" The research clearly shows that you can actually slow down sea - level rise when you increase temperatures over Antarctica because snowfall increases , but warmer temperatures also have the potential to speed up sea - level rise due to enhanced melting along the edges of Antarctica , " Monaghan said .
" Over the next century , whether the ice sheet grows from increased snowfall or shrinks due to more melt will depend on how much temperatures increase in Antarctica , and potentially on erosion at the ice sheet edge by the warmer ocean and rising sea level . "
The findings of the study do n't call into question model projections for other parts of the globe , Monaghan said .
" The models are really doing quite a good job at simulating the 20th century changes over the six inhabited continents , " he told LiveScience .

Siegelman : Exposing Rove is ' worth every day in prison '
In an hour - long interview with Thom Hartmann of Air America Radio , former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman pounded hard on what he sees as the three main issues raised by his case : the involvement of Karl Rove in the politicization of the Department of Justice , the apparent theft of the 2002 election in which he was defeated by Bob Riley , and money - laundering by Jack Abramoff and his associates .
" Rove 's fingerprints , from start to finish are on this case , " Siegelman told Hartmann , continuing a line of argument he began in an interview last week with Robert Kennedy , Jr. " It 's been a very expensive and costly ordeal for me and my family and , you know , we 're not whining .
If serving nine months in prison and spending every dollar I 've got will lead to ... the exposure of Karl Rove 's involvement , it will be worth every day in prison and every penny I 've spent . "
" When they dig up the evidence that was buried when Alberto Gonzales and Rove left the White House , " explained Siegelman , " they 're going to find that , I believe , that Karl Rove provided an umbrella of protection over those people who were operating to abuse the Department of Justice , because it just does n't make sense why these people would violate the law with impunity unless they knew that their bosses or someone higher up had given the green light for them to do so . "
Siegelman went on to speak about the apparent theft of the 2002 election , a topic that has so far been avoided by the mainstream media .
" We won the election , " he stated unequivocally .
" The votes were counted and were declared , and then in one county , which is controlled by Republicans , after midnight when everybody went home , when the poll workers were sent home , when the media was gone , they decided to electronically recount these votes and shifted the votes and certified the vote illegally the next day .
The , interestingly , Karl Rove 's client stepped in , the attorney general stepped in and said , ' if anybody tries to hand count these votes we 're going to put them in jail ' . "
" There 's a new book out by Mark Crispin Miller , New York college professor , called Loser Take All , " continued Siegelman .
" There are two articles in there , one by Larisa Alexandrova who writes for Raw Story and a professor from Auburn University , both of which ... actually go into the fact that it's a mathematical impossibility for the election not to have been stolen . "
Siegelman finally raised the issue of money - laundering by Jack Abramoff and his associates .
" When I was in prison with no bail in Louisiana , my spirits were uplifted by my friends and the letters and prayers that they sent , " he stated .
" It was uplifted by John Conyers and what he was doing and my own Congressman Artur Davis , but especially uplifted when the national media started spotlighting the injustices beginning with Karl Rove but , you know , but also focussing on Jack Abramoff and what , you know , Abramoff was , I think , Rove 's bag man . "
" I think one of the people who emerged as a hero in this story of all roads leading to Rove is Henry Waxman , " continued Siegelman , " because he is following the money , following Abramoff , and if you look at where that money went , a lot of it came into Alabama .
Tom Delay 's money came through Alabama as well .
...
And it's also interesting that there has been no federal investigation of Ralph Reed 's involvement , of Grover Norquist 's involvement and the fact that they were used as conduits by Rove and Abramoff for trying to destroy me . "
" I think Henry Waxman is on the trail to something , " Siegelman concluded .
" And I want to encourage those of you who are out in California to give him a pat on the back and encourage him to stay on the trail until he finds stuff that will lead to Rove . "

The price of oil hit a record high above $ 135 a barrel on Thursday - more than twice what it cost a year ago .
The latest surge was driven by data showing that US supplies of crude had fallen - but the price later fell back sharply as traders took profits .
In the US , the benchmark light , sweet crude contract hit $ 135.09 , taking its gain for the year to more than 40 % .
In May 2007 it was priced at about $ 65 .
Higher oil prices push up the price of fuel , energy bills and food .
The path of UK petrol and diesel prices
The average price of a litre of unleaded petrol in the UK is now about 114 pence , and diesel has risen to an average of about 126.4 pence per litre .
And the motoring organisation , the AA , said that another $ 5 leap in the oil price could add a further 2.5 p to the price at the pump .
" The threat of even higher prices in the pipeline will perch like a vulture above UK forecourts waiting to pick an even bigger hole in the pocket of drivers and consumers , " AA president Edmund King said .
' Challenging '
The impact of rocketing oil prices continues to feed through into the wider economy .
UK'S CHEAPEST & MOST EXPENSIVE FUEL Cheapest unleaded : 107.9 p ( Gateshead )
Most expensive unleaded : 125 p ( Northampton ) Cheapest diesel : 117.9 p ( Mansfield )
Most expensive diesel : 138 p ( Hexham ) Source : PetrolPrices.com
The British Chamber of Commerce warned that companies were being pushed to the " absolute edge " , and called on Chancellor Alistair Darling to abandon plans to increase petrol duty by 2p in October Meanwhile American Airlines has become the first US carrier to charge for checked - in luggage as it tries to increase revenue being eroded by its fuel bills .
It will also cut " thousands " of jobs .
Air France - KLM said on Thursday that the cost of oil would make the coming year " challenging " .
And earlier this month , British Gas owner Centrica signalled that bills could rise again , as its profits are squeezed by higher gas and power prices .
Investment needed
In a more global economy , there 's going to be tougher competition for oil supplies
Stephanie Flanders
BBC Economics Editor
Read Stephanie 's analysis UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is working with international partners to persuade the Opec oil producers ' cartel to increase supply .
His spokeswoman said that Mr Brown recognised the increases were having an effect on UK consumers and he would be raising this at the forthcoming EU and G8 summits .
But one analyst said Mr Brown 's efforts were likely to prove in vain and political pressure should , instead , be exerted on leading producers to invest more in long - term capacity .
" All this excess profit that has been generated by the oil industry really needs to be invested in refineries , pipelines and oil wells , " Francisco Blanch , head of global commodities research at Merrill Lynch , told the BBC .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This has hit me hard financially as I have to use my car for work Kevin , Gloucester " This is what the market is asking for at the moment and we just need to ensure ... we have the political goodwill also supporting this investment . "
Opec has so far blamed price rises on speculators and says there is no shortage of oil .
All but three of Opec 's members are already at their maximum daily limits for oil output and pressure has grown on Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the UAE , which do have spare capacity .
Further rises ?
Some analysts have raised the possibility of prices rising as high as $ 200 a barrel during the next 18 months .
In addition to falling US stockpiles , the continuing weakness of the US dollar has been another factor cited as supporting prices .
The US Energy Information Administration blamed the fall in its stocks figure on a fall in imports and a pick - up in demand from refineries .
Oil prices have set new records in 10 of the last 14 trading sessions .
Global impact of oil price rises " You really cannot forecast how much further the market will rally now , " said Tatsuo Kageyama from Kanetsu Asset Management in Tokyo .
" All I can say is the market will continue to rise . "
Light , sweet crude oil is the type most commonly used for processing into petrol and as a result , it is in high demand .
It has large amounts of the content used to make petrol , top - grade diesel and kerosene .
It also has low levels of sulphur .
Its price pulled back sharply as dealers took profits from the surge , settling down $ 2.36 at $ 130.81 a barrel London 's Brent crude fell $ 2.30 to $ 130.40 , having set an intra-day high on Thursday , peaking at $ 135.14 a barrel .

What are these ?
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who runs one of the largest state governments in the country , approached the leader of another giant organization recently to ask for some financial aid .
In a telephone call from his Capitol office , Schwarzenegger secured agreement from General Electric ’s chairman and chief executive , Jeffrey Immelt , that the Fortune 500 company would co-host and help pay for the Border Governors Conference this August at Universal Studios in Hollywood , which the corporation owns .
The event could cost more than $ 3 million between GE and other private sponsors , according to participants in the planning of the conference , who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the arrangements .
That would make it an expensive example of a technique Schwarzenegger has embraced to bring the glitzy style he appreciates to ceremonial state functions : getting corporations and wealthy supporters to pay for them .
The governor ’s aides say the practice saves taxpayers money .

Government watchdog groups argue that it may compromise the administration ’s independence from corporate interests .
Schwarzenegger ’s phone call with Immelt was arranged by a GE executive , formerly an advisor to the governor , who oversees the company ’s lobbyists in Sacramento .
“ It ’s a governmental conference , with governmental officials , ” said Robert Stern , president of the Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles .
“ If GE is paying for it , the question is what does GE expect for their contribution ?
And they are certainly going to expect good will . ”
A spokesman for General Electric said the size and nature of the company ’s contribution have not been finalized , and administration officials said there is no budget yet .
Schwarzenegger ’s office has accepted millions of dollars in private gifts for things such as state dinners , international travel and ornaments on state Christmas trees .

The cross - border conference , held each year in one of the 10 participating U.S. and Mexican states , is an important event for Schwarzenegger because it is the first to be hosted in California in eight years , and the only one while he is governor .
“ We are going to take this important annual event to a whole new level , ” Schwarzenegger said last month in a statement announcing the partnership .
The three - day conference will feature a “ Green Tech Expo , ” along with festivities at the Universal theme park ’s “ Streets of the World ” and “ Spartacus Square , ” and at the nearby Hilton hotel .
The thread connecting Schwarzenegger and the company is an interest in environmentally friendly technology .
GE has a 3 - year - old program , “ Ecomagination , ” which includes producing such things as clean locomotive engines , wind turbines , energy - efficient appliances and solar panels .
Ecomagination accounted for $ 14 billion of GE ’s $ 173 billion in revenue last year , a spokesman said .

GE has spent $ 475,000 lobbying California government since the beginning of 2007 on such matters as corporate taxes , the film industry and the recall of unsafe products .
Paul Miner , the former Schwarzenegger aide who brokered the conference deal , is now the GE government relations manager who coordinates the lobbying team .
Aaron McLear , Schwarzenegger ’s spokesman , said the governor never unduly favors his supporters in official decisions .
McLear said the conference would boost business in Los Angeles without costing the public money .
“ The governor absolutely believes in saving the taxpayers money any chance he can , ” McLear said .
“ So if he can partner with a private entity to host an event like this , that saves taxpayer dollars . ”
GE spokesman Peter O’Toole said Immelt agreed to sponsor the conference , which will require closing parts of Universal Studios to tourists , partly because both Schwarzenegger and Immelt are “ fairly progressive . ”

“ We ’re doing it because he asked and we have a good relationship , ” O’Toole said .
“ Our thinking is similar between the CEO and the governor .
. . .
It ’s not a quid pro quo , but we thought it was something important to do .
It ’s an important market for us . ”
Schwarzenegger ’s office has received a wide range of corporate gifts .
For the governor ’s Christmas tree lighting event one year , S. Martinelli and Co. gave $ 297 in sparkling apple cider .
A New York ornament maker , whose glittery creations are collected by the governor and First Lady Maria Shriver , donated a few to decorate trees in Schwarzenegger ’s Capitol office .
Microsoft and Google each committed to donate hundreds of hours of consulting time for a state website soon to be unveiled that will allow Californians to compare public schools .
The Jordan Vineyard & Winery held a retreat for 20 of the governor ’s staff members .
General Motors donated the use of vehicles and drivers for two of the governor ’s trips to Asia .
Schwarzenegger ’s inaugural ceremonies last year were funded by $ 2.9 million in donations from the pharmaceutical industry , energy companies , home builders and others .
Companies pay for the governor ’s Sacramento hotel suite , costing $ 107,000 this year .

The bulk of private support received by Schwarzenegger ’s office has come from the California Protocol Foundation , a nonprofit group affiliated with the California Chamber of Commerce that does not disclose the names of its donors or the details of specific expenditures .
The foundation paid $ 306,000 in 2006 for a Sacramento dinner for then - Mexican President Vicente Fox , state records show .
It has funded annual receptions after Schwarzenegger ’s State of the State addresses .
The group has spent millions on jet planes , hotels and meals for the governor and his staff on trips described as “ trade missions . ”
“ If the taxpayers were paying for some of these glitzy things , I think there would be objections , ” said Jon Coupal , president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn .
But the flow of private money to elected officials ’ causes is “ something that should be watched . ”
“ We recognize that there could never be a solid wall of separation between government and private interests , but sometimes when the relationship gets a little too cozy , it makes us nervous , ” Coupal said .

Since 1980 , when it was first convened in Chihuahua , Mexico , the Border Governors Conference has alternated between U.S. and Mexican states .
The purpose is to keep open lines of communication .
Former Gov. Gray Davis hosted the event in 2000 in Sacramento .
Meetings were held at public buildings , including the Capitol and a city library , where government absorbed the costs .
The Golden State Host Committee , a privately funded nonprofit also affiliated with the California Chamber of Commerce , spent $ 196,000 to hold two dinners during the conference .
In planning last year ’s conference in Sonora , Mexico , a small industrial and agricultural state , Gov. Eduardo Bours Castelo recruited corporations to pay for it , said Luis Borbon , an aide .
“ It was going to be very , very expensive for the government , ” Borbon said .
In addition , he said , the governor thought it was “ a good place for companies to have their name seen . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict , marking the third anniversary of his election , urged the U.S. Catholic Church on Saturday to overcome its divisions and seek “ purification ” and the truth following its sexual abuse scandal .
Benedict began the penultimate day of his first U.S. papal visit with a solemn Mass in New York ’s St. Patrick ’s Cathedral , the Gothic church completed in 1879 with the pennies of immigrants and known as the center of American Catholicism .
The pope rode down New York ’s usually bustling Fifth Avenue , a section of which was eerily deserted and sealed off by security agents , in a black limousine and emerged wearing a fur - fringed white cape .
He was welcomed on the steps of the great cathedral by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who earlier in an address inside the church joked about being Jewish .
“ Pope Benedict could not have picked a better time to come to New York -- a beautiful spring weekend , the 200th anniversary of the archdiocese of New York , and on top of that it ’s Passover , ” Bloomberg said .
The Mass reflected New York ’s ethnic mix , with prayers in Spanish , Portuguese , Chinese , Korean , German and Akan , a group of languages from West Africa still used there and by the descendants of escaped slaves from South America .
For the fifth consecutive day , the pope spoke out about the sexual abuse scandal that rocked the U.S. Church and has cost it some $ 2 billion in settlement payments with victims .
In his sermon , he said he was spiritually close to the U.S. Church as it deals with the aftermath of the scandal and cleanses and renews itself .
“ I join you in praying that this will be a time of purification for each and every particular Church and religious community , a time for healing .
I also encourage you to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue , ” he said .
MOVE FORWARD , SEEK THE TRUTH
The pope , who lamented “ division between different groups , different generations , different members of the same religious family , ” asked God to grant the U.S. Church “ a renewed sense of unity and purpose ” so that it could “ move forward in hope , in love for the truth and for one another . ”
Benedict , 81 , while in Washington on the first leg of the U.S. visit on Thursday , met victims of sexual abuse by priests .
On his way to the United States , he said that “ it is more important to have good priests than to have many priests . ”
Welcoming the pope into the cathedral , the archbishop of New York , Cardinal Edward Egan , referred to the sexual abuse crisis : “ You know our weaknesses and our strengths ... you know our victories and defeats , ” he said .

Vatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi denied reports that Cardinal William Levada , who succeeded the pope as chief doctrinal official , had said the Church might alter the statute of limitations on abuse cases .
He said no changes were planned .
Lombardi said the pope “ feels that the atmosphere is very friendly for him , the reception is very good and that people understand his message and feel they are understood by him . ”
The pope is trying to rally the spirits of a Church that has seen a drop in priestly vocations and the closing of inner city schools and consolidation of parishes .

The number of Catholic priests in the United States has fallen from more than 58,000 in 1965 to just under 41,500 last year , according to the Center for Applied Research into the Apostolate at Georgetown University .
While the number of U.S. Catholics rose from 45.6 million in 1965 to 64.4 million in 2007 , the number of graduate - level seminarians fell from 8,325 to 3,274 .
On Saturday night the pope traveled to the New York suburb of Yonkers , where , remembering his own youth under the yoke of the “ monster ” of Nazism , he urged young Americans to avoid the snares of drugs and materialism and seek the truth about life .
On Sunday the pope is to visit New York ’s Ground Zero , the site of the World Trade Center towers destroyed on September 11 , 2001 , and celebrate Mass at Yankee Stadium .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
After weeks of negotiations , the Florida Democratic Party said Monday it will not hold a second primary in the state .
The state party 's leaders have been seeking a way to have Florida 's delegation seated at the Democratic National Convention .
" We researched every potential alternative process -- from caucuses to county conventions to mail - in elections -- but no plan could come anywhere close to being viable in Florida , " said state party chairwoman Karen Thurman in an e-mail sent to Florida Democrats late Monday afternoon .
Thurman said the decision now falls to the DNC Rules & Bylaws Committee , which is scheduled to meet again next month .
But it is not clear whether that committee has the power to make a final decision , or whether it will fall to the Credentials Committee , which will decide in August which delegations will be seated at the presidential nominating convention in Denver .
Watch Florida Democrats abandon plans for second primary »
The national party stripped Florida of its delegates last year , along with Michigan , when both states scheduled their primaries in January in violation of DNC instructions .
None of the major candidates campaigned in Florida or Michigan ahead of those votes , but Sen.
Hillary Clinton was permitted to host a few fundraisers in Florida .
She won handily in Florida , winning not only most of the counties but also every county in the lower three - quarters of the state .
She took 50 percent of the vote to Sen. Barack Obama 's 33 percent .
Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards , who has since dropped out of the race , received 14 percent of the vote .
The Clinton campaign , which has pressed for the full Florida delegation to be seated , said it was disappointed with the state party 's decision .
" Today 's announcement brings us no closer to counting the votes of the nearly 1.7 million people who voted in January , " said Clinton spokesman Phil Singer .
" We hope the Obama campaign shares our belief that Florida 's voters must be counted and cannot be disenfranchised . "
Obama 's campaign released a statement : " We hope that all parties can agree on a fair seating of the Florida delegates so that Florida can participate in the Democratic Convention , and we look forward to working with the Florida Democratic Party and competing vigorously in the state so that Barack Obama can put Florida back into the Democratic column in November . "
Watch political analysts weigh in on fate of Florida 's delegates »
Florida 's Democrats had been weighing several options for a re-vote , including a possible mail - in primary to be held before the DNC 's June 10 deadline .
" I'm glad that the party has reached the same conclusion that was reached by the congressional delegation a week ago , " said U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , D - Florida .
A supporter of Clinton , Wasserman Schultz had staunchly opposed a re-vote .
She said she would consider a proposal that would allow the full delegation to weigh in at the convention , but she wants each delegate to have only half a vote .
Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , an Obama supporter , said Obama would like to see Florida 's delegates counted in a way that would not alter the overall outcome heading into the party 's convention .
But , he said , Obama wants to " give Florida the opportunity to vote . "
Daschle rejected the one - half person formula that seemed to gain traction last week as prospects for a second primary grew more remote .
State party officials developed a draft plan that was sent last week to national party leaders , including DNC chairman Howard Dean and the Clinton and Obama campaigns .
The plan called for combining mail - in and in - person primary votes in a new contest that would conclude June 3 .
The proposal would have let the state regain its 210 delegates .
Florida 's congressional Democrats quickly rejected that idea .
" After reviewing the party 's proposal and individually discussing this idea with state and local leaders and elections experts , we do not believe that this is a realistic option at this time and remain opposed to a mail - in ballot election or any new primary election in Florida of any kind , " they said in a statement released Thursday night .

Here 's a new use for the Eye - Fi wireless SD card that we had n't considered : A virtual private eye .
Eye - Fi user Alison DeLauzon lost $ 1,000 worth of photo gear while on holiday in Florida .
The Eye - Fi SD card , once plugged into your camera , hooks up to the internet and sends your photos to either an online sharing site or directly back to your home machine .
In this case it was the latter , and the hapless thief not only sent the precious vacation shots back to Alison 's computer , but – according to the email we received from Gadget Lab reader Joe Volat – " pictures [ of ] the thieves proudly displaying Alison 's lifted camera equipment . "
" I opened up the Eye - Fi manager on the computer and , lo and behold , there are the guys that stole our cameras , " DeLauzon told Reuters .
This is certainly not the first time that technology has foiled a foolish felon : remember the tattooed man who fell afoul of the auto uploading FlickBooth ?
But in this case , the thief was extra unlucky .
The current generation of Eye - Fi cards need to be preconfigured for each hotspot they access .
In this case , the thief was unlucky enough to stumble across an access point with the exact same SSID and lack of password as one of Alison 's regular haunts .
We 're guessing it was an unsecured hot spot with the default SSID .
Thanks ,

Ancient Beachcombers May Have Travelled Slowly
Earliest known human settlement in the Americas raises new questions
Chilean coastline and inland food samples raise questions about how migrants populated the Americas .
May 8 , 2008
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
New evidence , more questions .
That 's the thumbnail of the first new data reported in 10 years from Monte Verde , the earliest known human settlement in the Americas .
Evidence from the archaeological site in southern Chile confirms Monte Verde is the Americas earliest known settlement and is consistent with the idea that early human migration occurred along the Pacific Coast more than 14,000 years ago , but questions remain about just how rapidly that migration occurred .
" If all the early American groups were following a similar pattern of moving back and forth between inland and coastal areas , then the peopling of the Americas may not have been the blitzkrieg movement to the south that people have presumed , but a much slower and more deliberate process , " says Tom Dillehay , professor of anthropology at Vanderbilt University , Nashville , Tenn. , who led the study .
The journal Science publishes a report on the findings by Dillehay and team of international scientists in its May 9 issue .
" Monte Verde is an iconic site in New World archaeology and Americanist archaeologists recognize its importance , " says John Yellen , program manager at the National Science Foundation , which funded the research .
" They also agree that Tom Dillehay has conducted an outstanding program of research there . "
Most scholars now accept that people entered North America through the Bering Strait land bridge before 16,000 calendar years ago .
It is not known whether people colonized the Americas by moving along the Pacific coast , through interior routes or both .
Researchers envision that coastal migration would have been a rapid process , but seaweed samples and gomphothere meat ( meat from an extinct elephant - like animal that was widespread in the Americas 12 - 1.6 million years ago ) found at Monte Verde may be signs of slower migration .
Although the site is located 50 miles from the Pacific coast and 10 miles from an inland marine bay to the south , Dillehay and the research team identified nine species of seaweed and marine algae found in hearths and other areas in the settlement .
The samples were directly dated between 14,220 to 13,980 years ago , 1,000 years earlier than other reliably dated human settlements in the Americas and indicate that early immigrants could have moved south along the shoreline exploiting familiar coastal resources to get much of their food .
The researchers also found a number of inland resources , including gomphothere meat .
The finding suggests immigrants moved back and forth between the coast and inland areas .
" It takes time to adapt to these inland resources and then come back out to the coast .
The other coastal sites that we have found also show inland contacts , " says Dillehay .
A wide variety of food was found at the site , including an extinct species of llama , shellfish , vegetables and nuts .
The findings make it more difficult to determine the rate of coastal migration in the Americas and the specific path of the immigrants .
" We have no hard evidence that people migrated either rapidly or slowly along the coast , " says Dillehay .
" Most scholars believe that the first people came via the land bridge but the question is open . "
Evidence to support the coastal migration theory is particularly hard to find because sea levels at the time were about 200 feet lower than today .
As the sea level rose , it covered most of the early coastal settlements .
But the seaweed finding , one of the most significant , verifies the migrants ' use of coastal resources , making it a likely path .
" Finding seaweed was n't a surprise , but finding five new species in the abundance that we found them was a surprise , " said Dillehay .
" The Monte Verdeans were really like beachcombers .
The number and frequency of these items suggests very frequent contact with the coast , as if they had a tradition of exploiting coastal resources . "

Now , according to
Mayor Dave Heilmann was very disappointed with the decision .
" The community loved them " , he said , " and we heard from all over the country about how thinking outside the box was a good way to reinforce the message that people need to stop " .
" I think government needs to take itself less seriously , " he added .
" We have to take the work seriously , but it 's OK to smile and to be creative in enforcing a serious message . "
What do you think about it ?
In mid 2007 Oak Lawn authorities , in Illinois , began hanging some humorous additions to the city stop signs in an attempt to have drivers obey the signs .
They added slogans such as " and smell the roses " and " means that you are n't moving " to 50 stop signs .
Now , according to Chicago Tribune , Oak Lawn will have to remove the signs after the Illinois Department of Transportation determined they violate the federal Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices .

( Adds call to Citi . )

Of ZAWYA DOW JONES
DUBAI ( Zawya Dow Jones ) -- Mideast sovereign wealth funds may fail to save troubled U.S. banking giant Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % unless more cash is pumped into the lender , the head of a $ 13 billion Dubai - owned investment firm said Tuesday .
Sameer Al Ansari , Chief Executive of Dubai International Capital told delegates at a private equity conference that it will take more than the combined efforts of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , the Kuwait Investment Authority and Saudi investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal to save the bank .
" It 's going to take more than that to rescue Citi , " Ansari said .
He added that more write downs are expected and that Gulf investors would be required to bolster Citi .
The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , or ADIA , a sovereign wealth fund owned by the world 's fourth - largest oil exporter , last year bought a 4.9 % stake in Citigroup .
The Kuwait Investment Authority also said in January it would invest $ 3 billion in Citigroup .
Al Ansari said " it would take a lot more money to rescue Citigroup . "
A spokesperson for Citi was unable to comment immediately when called Tuesday .
Dubai International Capital , an investment firm controlled by Dubai 's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum , owns a stake in HSBC Holdings PLC ( HSBA.LN ) , bought 3.12 % in European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co last year .
The company also owns a stake in Standard Chartered PLC ( STAN.LN ) , according to Zawya Investor .
The intervention of sovereign funds such as ADIA , which pumped $ 7.6 billion into Citi , has failed to stem a decline in the bank 's share price that was first triggered by the emergence last year of an $ 11 billion sub - prime write - down that led to the resignation of the then embattled chief executive Charles ' Chuck ' Prince .
Citi's share price has fallen by more than 33 % since late November , when the ADIA stake purchase was first reported , till date to close at $ 23.09 Tuesday .
The bank said in January that it lost $ 9.83 billion in the fourth quarter spurred by $ 18 billion in write - downs .
To stem the losses Citi said it planned to raise $ 14.5 billion in capital by selling stakes to investors including Saudi's Prince Alwaleed , the lenders largest single shareholder .
Since coming out in support of former chief executive Prince prior to his resignation billionaire Alwaleed has commented little on Citi 's current travails .
A spokesperson for Prince Alwaleed 's office did n't answer calls on Tuesday .
Middle East sovereign funds flush with cash from record oil earnings are looked upon as possible saviors for many international lenders reeling from continued U.S. sub -prime losses .
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani , chief executive of the Qatar Investment Authority , QIA , told Zawya Dow Jones in January that the emirate 's sovereign wealth fund planned to invest up to $ 15 billion buying stakes in up to 12 blue - chip U.S. and European banks .
The Qatari fund said last month that it had built a significant stake in Credit Suisse Group CS , - 0.70 % .
The Swiss lender later said it had incurred a $ 2.85 billion hit from bad trading .

costs are changing commutes
High gas prices cause workers to consider distances to jobs as well as salary offers when deciding on positions
Yoko Olsgaard , of Oakland , Calif. , starts her short commute on Wednesday , June 25 , 2008 , in Oakland , Calif .
After turning down a job offer in Fremont , Callif . , Olsgaard took a lower paying job as a project manager for Kaiser Permanente in Emeryville because she figured she would easily make up the difference in gas costs with a shorter commute .

A couple of months ago , Yoko Olsgaard was weighing offers for two project management positions .
One was in Fremont , about 27 miles from her home in Oakland 's Redwood Heights neighborhood .
The other , which paid 10 percent less , was with Kaiser Permanente in Emeryville , about 7 miles away .
She ended up choosing the lower - paying Kaiser job .
The main reason ?
The high price of putting gas in her 2001 Toyota Camry .
" I had to consider the cash outlay , " Olsgaard , 53 , explained .
" That would have eaten into my take - home pay . "
As the cost of filling the tank rises relentlessly , job seekers across the country increasingly are saying no to work sites that are too far from home , labor market experts report .
In the Bay Area , long - distance commutes have become deal - killers for growing numbers of workers , a trend that is beginning to reshape travel and work patterns in the region .
Employers and staffing agencies say they 've noticed a flurry of cases in recent months of job candidates saying they can't afford to fill the tank for 20 - , 15 - or even 10 - mile drives to work .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" We 're making job offers that are being declined because of gas prices , " said Kerry Kiley , Bay Area regional operations manager for staffing giant Adecco .
" It 's happening daily , for positions that pay up to $ 50,000 or $ 60,000 .
People are looking for jobs closer to home . "
One of the effects of rising gas prices has been an increase in the use of public transportation .
In recent months , thousands of Bay Area commuters have left the roads in favor of trains , buses and ferries .
BART ridership rose 4.5 percent during the first three months of 2008 from the year before , while Caltrain saw a 6.4 percent jump .
But many jobs are in office parks or other sites far from public transit corridors , leaving few alternatives to the private automobile .
People who earn $ 15 or $ 20 an hour often can't afford to pay $ 60 or more a week to gas up .
So they 're trying to keep their travel distances short .
Earlier this year , Alivia Richardson of Campbell took a temporary job for a month at a hospital in Palo Alto , a round trip of more than 40 miles .
Richardson , 21 , found herself putting $ 50 a week into her Honda Civic , even though she was n't driving much after work .
So when she got another temp opportunity in Palo Alto , she turned it down , settling instead on a job with a technology company in Mountain View .
" If it 's not closer to home , I ca n't afford it , " she said , noting that she had bought the Honda precisely because it got good gas mileage .
Trade - offs in play
The choices people make about where they live and work , how far they commute and what form of transportation they use have always involved trade - offs , experts note .
The patterns that developed in much of America during the post - World War II period were based on relatively cheap suburban housing and cheap energy .
Housing has been hard to afford for many years now .
More recently , energy has shot up in price .
For many people , that 's making what once were reasonable choices about where to live and work untenable .
" The labor market and the housing market are responsive , " said Martin Wachs , director of the transportation , space and technology program at Rand , a Santa Monica think tank .
" Those markets adjust to conditions .
In the shorter term , there is a reshuffling in which people live closer to work by changing jobs or changing residences .
In the longer run , it could result in higher - density housing near worksites . "
Some people , especially those who are young and single , with fewer roots in their communities , find it easier to move near to work , Wachs said .
Others , especially those who are settled , find it easier to seek jobs closer to home .
But when the cost of fuel rises as precipitously as it has this year , many people do n't have the luxury of weighing options .
They simply can't afford to go to work far away .
" Now that gas prices are up to almost $ 5 a gallon , considering something like that is very important , " Richardson said .
As a result , persuading employees to hit the road has become a major headache for businesses in fields such as construction , landscaping and event management , in which work often involves travel to widely dispersed locations .
Travel - time compensation
" It 's the story of my life right now , " said Steve Scher , owner of Acrobat Staffing , a San Francisco firm placing temporary workers in food service and hospitality jobs , often one - time events .
Acrobat workers such as food servers and cooks have begun asking to be paid for travel time to offset the increased cost of fuel .
" They do n't want to get into the car unless I offer them an incentive , " Scher said .
Lauren Labinger , senior account manager in Acrobat 's Santa Clara office , said the agency 's employees increasingly are refusing jobs .
" I can usually get people to go to Palo Alto , but any city further than that - Redwood City , Belmont , San Mateo - that 's our dead zone , " she said .
To get staff members to travel longer distances , Acrobat is encouraging people to carpool , taking steps to make sure riders share gas costs with drivers .
" If there 's a job in Palo Alto and they 're coming from the city , they meet in the office , " Scher said .
Paula LeDuc Fine Catering manages events throughout the Bay Area , including in Wine Country , often 50 miles or more from its Emeryville headquarters .
It has an on - call culinary and service staff of more than 400 people who are frequently asked to handle events far from their homes .
The company has long paid its staff for travel time , using rates based on a grid that divides the Bay Area into zones .
As gas prices have soared recently , the company has n't bumped up the rate .
Instead , it 's developed a shuttle and carpool program .
And it doubles the travel rate if employees carpool .
" It 's not a cost we can pass on to our clients , " said Winn Burda , director of event management .
" Paying out more and more is not an option . "
In the long run , the labor market will adjust to high energy prices , transportation experts predict .
" Employers will offer four - day , 10 - hour schedules .
More people will be working at home .
Company vans and jitneys will be circulating .
Employers will have satellite work centers , " said Alan Pisarski , author of the " Commuting in America " reports of the Transportation Research Board in Washington .
Meanwhile , workers are finding that giving up long commutes is not only good for their wallets , but also for their spirits .
They have more time and less stress in their lives .
And some say they feel better about spewing less pollution into the atmosphere .
" Looking back , I think it was a wise decision , " Olsgaard said of her decision to work in Emeryville instead of Fremont .
" I 'm trying to become a more green person , so it appeals to me . "
Are Americans So Bored With Reality Television They 'd Put a Black Islamic Extremist in the White House ?
Election 2008 - True Christian Voter 's Guide Freehold , Iowa - For many Americans who are addicted to reality television and tired of the writers ' strike , their desperation for new programming is playing out in the voting booth .
" Presidential elections are not a game , " says Pastor Deacon Fred .
" But I fear that Americans are so lethargic , they 'll go to any length to keep themselves entertained - even when it comes to electing a President .
As True Christians ™ it is our job to keep these folks informed , and I 'm here to tell you , that we need to stop them from fooling around with the fate of our Christian Nation just to keep them from being bored !
I do n't care how much more interesting prime time television might be with a black Muslim sitting in the Oval Office , this is a serious matter , and unsaved Demoncrats need to wake up and smell the blood of Christ , before things get out of hand ! "
says Pastor .
To Islamic extremists ( like there is any other kind ! ) , watching Senator Barak Hussein Obama parading around on TV is just like looking into a mirror .
" Muslims ( or Islamists ) are born into Islam by blood , " says Pastor Deacon Fred , " Being Islamic is like being diabetic – you got yourself a disease that is carried in the blood !
Amen ?
It is just like Jewish folks are born Jewish and coloreds are born colored .
Sure , some people think they can convert to Judaism or stay out in the sun long enough to make folks think they are Negroes , but Jews and colored folks do n't really welcome them as true Jews or coloreds .
To be a bona fide Jew or card carrying member of the National Association of Advancing Colored People ( NAACP ) , you gotta be able to trace your bloodline back to old King David or his kitchen help – and have hair that gets real , crazy wavy without hours under a hot dyer with a head full of sponge curlers .
For Islamazoids , they trace their freedom - hating , dirty bloodline straight back to the brothel where their false prophet , Mohammed was born .
And there is a lot of tracing going on because that Mohammed fellow made more babies with more woman than a Magic 's Johnson could ever hope to do in ten lifetimes , even if he were n’t secretly attracted to preoperative she -males .
You laugh , but , surely , you godly folks do n’t think Magic got that homosexual disease of his from a toilet seat , now do you ? "
True Americans ™ should be concerned that possibly their next president , the product of Biblically forbidden interracial marriage ( be not unequally yoked together - 2 Corinthians 6:14 ) was born of a Muslim father and raised in Muslim schools in a region of the world where children are brainwashed into serving the mission of Al - Qaeda from the day their little heads pop out of their mothers ' lady parts .
" They are programmed like the Manchurian Candidate to snap back into being a militant Muslim when a secret word is said , ” explains Pastor Deacon Fred .
“ Now , I do n’t rightly know what that secret word is .
It may be something obscure that nobody says – like “ photosynthesis . ”
But what if it ’s something like , apple or lie – something a President hears everyday ?
We could wind up with a president who turns into a radical Islamic extremist four or five times every day – even before lunch !
I know it sounds like a pitch for a great new TV show , but for the love of Christ !
We 're talking about the fate of our Nation !
" Lets look at another thing these reality television starved Demoncrats do n't take into account , " says Pastor Deacon Fred , " It took white Americans over 100 years after they were freed from being slaves of tea-sipping Nancy boys from England to run for President , and now a " so - called " colored man expects to have that right after being free for half that time ?
Not in this country , Senator Hussein !
You 've got to wait your turn , like the rest of us !
Right now , America is just doing fine , thank you very much .
Any old crusty fence - sitting white man that comes our way , should be able to keep things moving along until the apocalypse .
That 's called , ' Affirmative Reaction ! '
Praise Jesus !
A comprehensive list of Barak Hussein Obama 's ties to the Muslim world has been compiled by the Landover Baptist Department for the Study of Inferior Cultures .
" We encourage all prospective voters , from the colored folks who help wash our dishes , to the kindly gentlemen who pick up our trash in the morning to review the list below before they make a horrible decision in this next election that could change the fate of our Christian Nation , and delay Armageddon for another four years or so !
Barack Hussein Obama 's Connections to the Nation of Islam :
His father was Islamic , and his mother was a lover of Islam .
She even married another Muslim man after Obama 's blood father died .
That little lady is ADDICTED to dark Muslim penis .
He was born in Hawaii , which is still ( to many True Christians™ ) a foreign country with questionable leanings .
Creation Scientists classify Hawaii as : Japanese Miami .
, which is still ( to many True Christians™ ) a foreign country with questionable leanings .
Japanese Miami .
He spent most of his youth in Muslim countries and received his early education in schools run by the Nation of Islam .
As True Christians ™ we believe that everything you really ever need to learn is taught in kindergarten - and in Obama 's case - this fact should send shivers down that long rubbery bone that is called your spine !
His original name was “ Baraka , ” which is not an African name .
It 's an Arabic word meaning “ blessed ” and comes directly from the Koran .
The Koran is a so - called " Holy Muslim Book , " the soft pages of which every God-fearing Republican secretly uses as toilet paper due to the sensitive nature of our conservative hineys .
He was involved in several developing communities projects in Chicago which assisted poor Muslim families who have no business in our country other than to make everyone nervous .
He has visited several Muslim countries in search of his demonic mixed - race roots .
He is often seen eating at Middle Eastern restaurants and appears suspiciously fond of foods that normal people are unable to pronounce , such as tabouli
In his college days , he would take his laundry to a Muslim owned laundry mat , and would often ask people who looked like they were Muslim to change his paper money for coins , which he would then feed to machines in a ritualistic fashion .
He brags about being an excellent poker player , hinting at the fact that he is good at bluffing when it comes to his religious heritage .
He is opposed to the war on Terror – an act so brazen he may as well have whipped out a laminated “ Islamic Extremist Membership ” card on national TV .
He frequents shops at businesses where Muslim men and women also may be shopping or know about .

From yesterdays oral argument before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Fox Television vs. Federal Communications Commission .
How ironic is it that a case dealing with the FCC results in expletives being aired censor - free on national television ?
From CSPAN : Fox Television is challenging the FCC 's indecency standards and the way it punishes broadcasters for airing shows that contain profanity .
The network argues that the government is violating the First Amendment by embarking on a " radical reinterpretation and expansion " of its power to punish broadcasters for indecent speech .
Fox Television contends that the FCC sharply changed its standards for profanity , that the standards are vague and make little sense in the face of industry changes .
The FCC fined Fox for language used by Cher and Nicole Richie on the live broadcasts of the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards , respectively .

Things That Should n’t - But Still Do - Go Boom !
There are rules about such things … or so we think .
After all , apples do n’t fall up , lions do n’t have feathers , and lakes do n’t explode .
Oh , but if you happened to be living in Cameroon you ’d know all too well that lakes can , and do , explode .
( art by Mario Sanchez Nevado )
Take for example the Lake Nyos in the Northwest Province of Cameroon .
Part of the inactive
Oku volcano chain , it ’s an extremely deep , extremely high , and most importantly , very calm , very still , lake .
But it has n’t always been so calm or still .
In 1986 something very weird happened to Lake Nyos , a weirdness that unfortunately killed 3,500 head of livestock … and 1,700 people .
( image credit : Dillonla )
No jokes this time .
No clumsy ' 50s horror movie metaphors .
What happened to the people in the three villages near that lake is n’t funny .
Most of them luckily died in their sleep , but the 4,000 others who escaped the region suffered from sores , respiratory problems , and even paralysis .
All because Lake Nyos exploded .
Limnic Eruption !
Before the why , here ’s some more .
What happened to the villages of Cha , Nyos , and Subum that time is n’t unique .
The same thing happened to Lake Monoun , also in Cameroon , in 1984 .
( courtesy of USGS )
That time 37 people died , again not pleasantly .
What sounds like a scene from some ugly horror flick is the story of a truck that had been driving near the scene .
Mysteriously , the truck ’s engine died , and then so did the ten people who got out : suffocating within minutes of stepping down .
Only two people of the dozen survived , all because they happened to be sitting on top of the truck .
The technical term for what happened to Lake Nyos and Monoun is a limnic eruption .
To get one you need a few basic elements :
- one , a very deep volcanic lake ;
- two , said lake has to be over a slow source of volcanic gas ;
- and three , it has to be very , very still .
( image credit : Degassing Project )
What happens is that volcanic gas , mostly carbon dioxide but nasty carbon monoxide as well , super saturates the lake .
A clumsy way of thinking about it is to compare it to a can of soda : shake it up like crazy and the fluid in the can , held back by pressure , does n’t do anything .
But pull the top , or in the case of Nyos and Monoun , deliver a small landslide or low magnitude earthquake , and all that trapped gas rushes out in an immense explosion .
That ’s bad enough , as there are even some theories suggesting that the subsequent lake - tsunami from the gassy blast has wiped out still more villages , but what ’s worse is that those gasses trapped in the lake water are absolutely deadly .
Heavier than air , the carbon dioxide flows down from the mountain lake , suffocating anything and anyone in its path , even truck engines low to the ground -- which explains how those two lucky passengers managed to escape : they were simply above the toxic cloud .
( art by Mario Sanchez Nevado )
Fortunately scientists and engineers are working on ways to stop limnic blasts .
With controlled taping of the gasses or by bubbling pipes to keep the water from becoming super saturated , it ’s beginning to look like they might be able to keep what happened to the 1700 people of Nyos from happening again .
The Brooding Lake :
( in the middle you see the pump that somewhat releases the gas pressure )
( image credit : Joel )
But what keeps other scientists awake at night is that there are more than likely lots of other lakes ready to explode .
( for example , Lake Bosumtwi in Ghana " explodes " at irregular intervals - source )
Lake Bosumtwi - a deadly beauty :
( image credit : Stig Nygaard )
According to this source , Lake Kivu in Rwanda also has a serious hazard in the depths of the lake - huge quantities of gas which could lead to a massive eruption :
( image credit : Eawag )
Mystery of the Exploding Frogs
Okay , so lakes can explode .
But fruit does n’t drop to the sky and feline African predators are n’t born with fluffy down , and frogs do n’t pop … right ?
Not if you happened to live in Germany a few years ago : for a while their toads were doing just that .
And we ’re not talking a few here and there .
More than 1,000 frogs were found burst and blasted in a lake that was soon stuck with the pleasant name “ the death pool . ”
Theories flew like parts of an exploding frog : a virus ?
A crazy who had a thing for dynamite and toads ?
A detonating mass suicide ?
The cops checked out the area and the local nut - houses but there was n’t anyone with that very weird and very specific MO .
Scientists checked out the exploded remains but found no suspicious viruses , parasites , or bacteria .
Then one veterinarian came up with the most likely answer : crows .
As anyone who has ever watched a crow knows they do not fit the label “ bird brain . ”
Extremely clever and resourceful , crows are not only fast learners but they study , and learn from , other crows .
Frank Mutschmann , one clever vet , had a hypothesis .
Craving the tasty livers of the toads , the crows had learned how to neatly extract them from their prey with a quick stab of their very sharp bills .
In response , the toads did what they always do : puffed themselves up .
The problem -- for the amphibians that is –- is that because they now had a hole where their livers were , that defense then became an explosive problem .
Weasels might not literally go pop in that old kid ’s song but that seems to be just what was happening to that lake of German toads in 2005 .
But that still does n’t change the fact that Pippins do n’t fall up , and lions do n’t have tails like a peacock ’s , right ?
And what about ants ?
They do n’t explode , do they ?
But they do .
Ants that commit explosive suicides
Ladies and gentlemen allow me to present camponotus saundersi .
Native to Malaysia , this average looking ant has a unique structure giving it an even more unique behavior when threatened .
Running the length of its little body are two mandibular glands full of toxins .
That ’s bad enough , as any critter that decides to try a bite will get a mouthful of foul - tasting , maybe even deadly , venom , but what sets this ant apart from others is what happens when it gets pushed into a corner .
By clamping down on a special set of muscles , these ants can commit violent and , yes , explosive suicide : taking out any nearby threat with a hail of nasty poisons .
It ’s certainly a dramatic way to go but you can bet that anything or anyone threatening its colony will get a shock it wo n’t soon forget .
Exploding lakes , bursting toads , and suicide - bombing ants
Sure , apples do n't fall up and lions do n’t have feathers – but what with exploding lakes , bursting toads , and suicide - bombing ants , you might want to check that your grandmother ’s homemade pie does n’t float away or that lions are n’t about to swoop down from the sky and carry you off .

FedEx Home Delivery SUCKS !
2/9/2006 - Today
I found a package hidden in the pile of scrap metal in front of my garage that FedEx said they had delivered 7 days ago .
It 's been sitting in the rain all that time .
They say their policy is that their drivers place packages where they think it will be most secure .
Obviously they have VERY POOR JUDGEMENT .
DO NOT USE FEDEX !
Resolution :
They would n't take a claim from me but after talking with their customer service I insisted on something to prove I called them .
They gave me a case number .
When the shipper called them , they would n't take the claim !
I gave the shipper the case number and FedEx FINALLY accepted the claim .
FedEx picked up the package from me .
I had carefully repacked it in another DRY box with extra packing material and the old box in a plastic bag .
Then I received a letter in the mail from FedEx telling me that the claim was rejected because of insufficient evidence .
The shipper sent me a new component via USPS Priority Mail with no problem .
Then FedEx RETURNED the wet package to me , in my packing , NEVER OPENED !
They did n't even look at it !
Then I received a check in the mail from FedEx for an amount LESS than I paid ( this should have gone to the shipper that filed the claim , not me ! )
I endorsed the check and forwarded it to the shipper .
Boy is FedEx screwed up !
This is n't the first time they have demonstrated their total lack of common sense .
Take the time they said they delivered a lot of 5 packages here when they had delivered NONE .
Then after much complaining they delivered 3 of the 5 on the following Saturday .
Then they showed the WRONG 3 delivered !
They FINALLY did get them all delivered 4 days late .
FEDEX SUCKS !
If you must ship using FedEx , expect the worst of all customer service !
Calling Customer Service does NO GOOD .
Only the shipper can file a claim .
GOOD LUCK getting any resolution !

GI - 7B Tube Sockets - I build these sockets for the Russian GI - 7B .
This is the Cadillac socket that provides excellent electrical connection using finger stock in a true plug in socket with lots of air flow around the base of the tube .
Other sockets suffer from inadequate air flow around the base and the possibility of the heater actually un-soldering itself from the center pin .

Gout - known as " the disease of kings and the king of diseases " -
What is it ?
It 's positively TERRIBLE !
When the uric acid levels rise too high in the body it begins to precipitate out as needle like crystals in the joints .
These crystals are responsible for your pain .
There is an old but effective treatment for gout and it is a drug called colchicine .
The problem with colchicine is the treatment prescribed by most doctors .
Most of them tell you to take one tablet an hour until you either get relief or get sick .
DO NOT DO THIS !
You will get sick as a dog and it's VERY dangerous .
An effective cautious treatment is to take one pill , wait 12 hours , take another and repeat this every 12 hours until you begin to get relief .
Usually you will begin to get relief within 24 hours and the worst you usually experience is a little diarrhea .
My own personal experience has been that I can take one pill every other day or so to lower the uric acid levels to help prevent an onset of gout .
I take Allopurinol daily but at times I think you need a little more help .
Never take colchicine without discussing this treatment with your doctor .

What is INVAR and why is it so important to us ?
Invar is a steel alloy containing about 36 % nickle ( it 's considered a stainless steel ) and exhibits a very low coefficient of thermal expansion over the normal range of temperatures experienced by humans .
That makes invar ideal for use as the threaded tuning rods in a duplexer !
It has been used in precision clocks and was also used in surveyer measuring tapes prior to electronic ranging instruments .

[ U.S. ] strategy should aim , above all , at the removal of Saddam Hussein ’s regime from power .
… [ His removal is absolutely vital to ] the security of the world in the first part of the 21st century [ and for ] the safety of American troops in the region , of our friends and allies like Israel and the moderate Arab states , and a significant portion of the world ’s supply of oil .

The high crude oil prices do not have any relation to production or consumption , … [ It is ] because of the decrease in the value of the dollar .
— Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran President , April 2008
The American economy seems to be going from bubble to bubble : in 2000 , it was the tech bubble ; in 2005 , it was the housing bubble ; and now , it is the oil and commodities bubble .
In fact , the entire world of investment is now a giant casino where speculators are in charge and where governments look the other way .
For many basic marketable staples ( rice , wheat , and corn ) and commodities ( oil , gas , metals ) , prices have no relation to the underlying values of what is being traded .
Such prices are mostly driven by bad policies and by the pyramidal “ greatest fool ” technique by which large off - shore speculators navigate through unregulated derivatives to push prices up ever further , until the bubble burst .
Meanwhile , a lot of disruptions may be created and people ’s lives may have been endangered or lost .
The current famine in many countries is the end result of such government approved manipulation of markets , by OPEC and a host of other cartels and so - called speculative hedge funds .
Is it possible for an economy to grow and prosper without always being on a roller coaster ?
Indeed , does the current explosion in oil and commodities prices reflect real supply and demand shifts , such as supply disruptions , or is it also or even mainly driven by geopolitical factors and financial speculation that fuel an ever larger insatiable artificial demand ?
It is my feeling that the plummeting U.S. dollar is having serious unintended economic consequences worldwide .
Indeed , such a panic devaluation of the most widely used key currency is fueling a major rush out of dollar holdings into hard assets , such as oil , gold and other commodities .
Central banks , companies and individuals are losing faith in the dollar paper currency , which has been depreciating fast against other currencies , but whose intrinsic value is also expected to be eroded further by the coming inflation that will inevitably follow the Fed ’s current liquidity creation .
All these problems are interconnected .
Let us remember that the oil problem in the U.S. is largely a self - inflicted predicament since the U.S. government opted to move away from a self - sufficiency and a renewable - energy based economy .
In 1982 , for example , the U.S. daily consumption of oil had been brought down to about 9 million barrels a day , from 14 million barrels a day before the 1973 OPEC - initiated oil shock .
Since the U.S. was producing about 9 million barrels of oil a day , it can be said the American economy was then self - sufficient in that form of energy needs .
The Reagan administration changed all that :
No more 55 - mile - an - hour driving limits ; reduced obligations for car manufacturers to raise gas mileage ; no more restrictions , fiscal or otherwise , on the purchase of gas guzzlers , etc .
The result is that the United States , with less than five percent of the world population , now consumes 25 percent of the daily world oil output , roughly 22 million barrels a day out of about 88 million barrels produced daily worldwide .
And , here ’s the gist , 60 percent of that oil has to be imported .
What ’s more , for the world as a whole , also 60 percent of oil imports come from the unstable Middle East .
That ’s what we can call playing with fire !
Therefore , since oil access under American control played an important part in the Bush - Cheney ’s decision to launch an unprovoked war against Iraq in the spring of 2003 , in order to turn that sovereign country into an American oil protectorate under management by a few major Anglo - American oil companies , it can said that the seeds for this illegal war were sown way back , during the Republican Reagan administration .
That was when the philosophy of deregulation was rampant and was then hailed as a success .
But , as a consequence , twenty - five precious years have been lost in preparing the U.S. economy for the time when oil would become a scarce energy source .
Now , this time has arrived , but this is still the era of Hummer type vehicles that can only run on large quantities of costly and risky imported oil .
Indeed , in the U.S. , there are now three cars for four adults and those cars are larger and have more powerful engines than anywhere else in the world .
If only a few countries , such as China and India , were to emulate the United State in that regard , as their income levels rise , world oil consumption would more than double .
But with no known oil reserves to meet such an expanded demand , oil prices would skyrocket , crushing the purchasing power of consumers and raising inflation .
The result would be a major worldwide economic crisis before economically viable alternative energy sources could be developed .
This could take ten to twenty years .
Are we there now ?
If not , we are moving fast toward that day of reckoning , while do - nothing or complicit governments hope for a miracle or some magic solution .
The main consequences will be rising inflation , 19th century wars for securing resources , and a worldwide economic slowdown in production and trade .
The next twenty years should prove to be interesting for a few , but taxing for the many .

It 's surprising that the blogosphere has n't picked up the biggest difference in pricing :
Google 's datastore is less than a tenth of the price of Amazon 's SimpleDB while offering a better API .
Why is n't Google 's aggressive new database pricing strategy getting more pub ?
That 's what Bill Katz , instigator of the GAE Meetup and prize winning science fiction author is wondering :
If money matters to you then the burn rate under GAE could be convincingly lower .
Let 's compare the numbers :* $ 0.10 - $ 0.12 per CPU core - hour * $ 0.15 - $ 0.18 per GB - month of storage * $ 0.11 - $ 0.13 per GB outgoing bandwidth * $ 0.09 - $ 0.11 per GB incoming bandwidth * $ 0.14 per Amazon SimpleDB Machine Hour consumed * Structured Data Storage - $ 1.50 per GB - month * $ 0.100 per GB - all data transfer in * $ 0.170 per GB - first 10 TB / month data transfer out ( more on the site ) Clearly Google priced their services to be competitive with Amazon .
We may see a response by Amazon in the near feature , but the database storage cost for GAE is dramatically cheaper at $ 0.15 - $ 0.18 per GB - month vs $ 1.50 per GB - month .
Interestingly , Google 's price is the same as Amazon 's S3 ( file storage ) pricing .
Google seems to think of database storage as more like file storage .
That makes a certain amount of sense because BigTable is a layer on the Google File System .
File system pricing may be the more appropriate price reference point .
On SimpleDB a 1TB database costs $ 1,500 / month and BigTable costs in the $ 180 / month range .
As you grow into ever larger data sets the difference becomes even more compelling .
If you are a startup your need for funding just dropped another notch .
It 's hard to self - finance many thousands of dollars a month , but hundreds of dollars is an easy nut to make .
Still , Amazon 's advantage is they support application clusters that can access the data for free within AWS .
GAE excels at providing a scalable two tier architecture for displaying web pages .
Doing anything else with your data has to be done outside GAE , which kicks up your bandwidth costs considerably .
How much obviously depends on your application .
But if your web site is of the more vanilla variety the cost savings could be game changing .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The top U.S. commander for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars said on Tuesday he would quit after a magazine reported he was pushing President George W. Bush to avoid war with Iran .
Commander of the U.S. Central Command Navy Adm. William Fallon testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington March 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
Adm. William “ Fox ” Fallon , head of the U.S. Central Command headquarters responsible for the Middle East , insisted he did not disagree with the Bush administration over Iran but perceptions of a rift made it difficult for him to do his job .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates dismissed suggestions that Fallon ’s departure made war with Iran more likely .
“ The notion that this decision portends anything in terms of a change in Iran policy is ... ridiculous , ” Gates said .
“ Admiral Fallon reached this difficult decision entirely on his own , ” Gates said at the Pentagon .
“ I believe it was the right thing to do , even though I do not believe there are , in fact , significant differences between his views and administration policy . ”
The Bush administration says its policy is to use diplomacy to resolve differences with Iran , particularly over Tehran ’s nuclear program , but it will not rule out military action .
Washington and other Western nations say Iran is trying to develop the capability to build nuclear weapons .
Iran says its program is to produce energy .
Fallon ’s headquarters in Tampa , Florida , oversees U.S. operations in 27 countries , including Iraq and Afghanistan .
The first Navy officer to serve as Central Command chief , 63 - year - old Fallon has been in the post for just under a year .
Gates accepted his request to retire at the end of the month .
Fallon is known as a tough , plain - speaking commander but also has a reputation for favoring dialogue .
He pursued good relations with China when he headed U.S. Pacific Command .
“ BETWEEN WAR AND PEACE ”
Titled “ The Man Between War And Peace , ” the Esquire article that led to his resignation described him as challenging the White House and urging restraint on Iran .
Fallon cooperated with the author during the article ’s preparation but strongly criticized the story after it appeared , describing it as “ poison pen stuff . ”
Gates said the perception that Fallon was at odds with the administration was not linked just to the article .
“ We have tried between us to put this misperception behind us over a period of months and , frankly , just have not been successful in doing so , ” he said .
“ I think this is a cumulative kind of thing . ”
Fallon has also denied reports he has a testy relationship with Army Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq .
Democrats in the U.S. Congress charged that Fallon ’s departure was another sign the Bush administration did not tolerate military commanders who spoke their mind .
The Pentagon rejected that , saying Gates had encouraged openness since taking over from Donald Rumsfeld in December 2006 .
Fallon ’s deputy , Army Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey , will run Central Command until a long - term successor is found , Gates said .
Fallon said in a statement : “ Recent press reports suggesting a disconnect between my views and the president ’s policy objectives have become a distraction at a critical time and hamper efforts in the CENTCOM region . ”
He said he had concluded that it “ would be best to step aside and allow the Secretary and our military leaders to move beyond this distraction . ”
Both Gates and Bush praised Fallon ’s military service .
“ Admiral William Fallon has served our nation with great distinction for forty years , ” Bush said in a statement .
“ During his tenure at CENTCOM , Admiral Fallon ’s job has been to help ensure that America ’s military forces are ready to meet the threats of an often troubled region of the world , and he deserves considerable credit for progress that has been made there , especially in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” Bush said .
As far as the [ arcade ] industry itself goes it had become -- and still is -- severely polarized .
The only titles that were succeeding were SSJPK fighting games -- Side - Scrolling , Jump - Punch - Kick -- a very few sports titles , and high - tech driving titles .
The market had become completely indifferent to innovation in game design .
It seemed that all our management wanted to see in development was whatever was currently earning money .
For so many years Atari had led the industry in innovation by constantly looking forward .
Now we were n't even looking over our shoulders , we were struggling to climb on a tired bandwagon .
-- Ed Rotberg , speaking around 1996 , in James Hague 's book Halcyon Days : Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Game Programmers
What happened to the Atari fanboys ?
Nintendo and Sega have theirs , Blizzard and Bungie too , Square and Enix , Capcom and SNK .
Yet Atari Games , in its heyday , produced some of the most brilliant arcade game designs the world has ever seen .
Unique and idiosyncratic , at its best it made games the likes of which no one else could .
Later , it is sad to say , it produced games that no one else would want to .
Some people rave about Nintendo ; how its designers come up with new ideas so often , about its fearlessness in taking risks with unconventional designs , and how it reinvents its franchises endlessly .
But even Nintendo has never been as original , as brilliant , as determined to design what developers think best regardless of what management , critics , and eventually , even players might have to say , as was Atari Games in its heyday .
A trip through Atari 's classic arcade game catalog is like a course in game design all by itself .
A World of Ideas
Arguably , this was the company that kept the spirit of classic arcades alive the longest -- as late as the early '90s .
Even now , the company - which - calls - itself - Atari -- which should not be confused with the company this article is devoted to -- shills out the memory of the former arcade powerhouse with GBA and DS ports of classic - era games .
Many of Atari 's games were the targets of unequaled numbers of home adaptations .
Rampart has over a dozen , and no one knows how many versions of Breakout are out there , considering how shareware authors have adopted and colonized the idea -- not to mention Taito , and Arkanoid .
Atari , particularly the arcade division that split off from the company in the ' 80s rechristened " Atari Games , " seemed restless with ideas .
A game where players race marbles through a world of grid lines ?
Float innertubes down fantastic rivers ?
Defend castles with walls and cannons ?
Skateboard while chased by bees ?
Deliver newspapers ?
While the company also had its share of less - than - memorable ideas ( Pit - Fighter , Thunderjaws , Batman , most games after 1991 ) , it is easy to overlook such missteps when the company also gave us Tempest .
And at its best , Atari Games seemed almost embarrassingly creative .
Other companies could deliver with the absurd premise once in a while ( what the hell was Namco smoking when it released Phozon ? ) , but Atari used to do it all the time .
At least , Atari did n't stop doing it in 1986 .
It released an update of Breakout the same year Capcom started selling Street Fighter II .
I consider this to be unspeakably awesome , but it should be understood that most players at the time would have disagreed with me .
Sneaky Sharks Are Smarter Than Our Media
I was watching the “ important coverage ” of this morning ’s shark attack in California when I happened to notice this headline .
Is it just me or is this sort of obvious ?
I love that .
Sharks “ typically attack from below . ”
Below what , the water ?
As far as I know very few sharks have the ability to attack from “ above ” the water but they are crafty buggers so who knows .
Frankly that would be a news story worth reporting …
Ironically , this headline is almost as useless as a story about a swimmer getting attacked by a shark .
During the first ' Deathball match ' , the booth window is smashed and Wernstrom gets knocked onto the court , however in the next overview shot , the window is intact and he is still stood behind it .

Alternate Versions
This direct - to - DVD movie was the 2nd of 4 to be released after the tv series was cancelled at the end of season 5 .
When the series was to be revived on a different network , this movie was split into 4 parts , each part equal to the usual length of a tv episode , and shown first as season 6 episodes 5 through 8 .
The other 3 movies were also similarly split and formed the rest of season 6 , 16 episodes in all .
Finally , the new episodes made specifically for tv followed as season 7 .
This practice was identically used for later tv syndication and streaming services such as Hulu .

Your brain may only be able to hold three or four things in your conscious mind at one time .
I forget how I wanted to begin this story .
That 's probably because my mind , just like everyone else 's , can only remember a few things at a time .
Researchers have often debated the maximum amount of items we can store in our conscious mind , in what 's called our working memory , and a new study puts the limit at three or four .
Working memory is a more active version of short - term memory , which refers to the temporary storage of information .
Working memory relates to the information we can pay attention to and manipulate .
Early research found the working memory cut - off to be about seven items , which is perhaps why telephone numbers are seven digits long ( although some early telephone dialing started with a two - or three - letter " exchange , " often the first letters of a community name , followed by four or five figures , e.g. PEnnsylvania 6-5000 ) .
Now scientists think the true capacity is lower when people are not allowed to use tricks like repeating items over and over or grouping items together .
" For example , when we present phone numbers , we present them in groups of three and four , which helps us to remember the list , " said University of Missouri - Columbia psychologist Nelson Cowan , who co-led the study with colleagues Jeff Rouder and Richard Morey .
" That inflates the estimate .
We believe we 're approaching the estimate that you get when you cannot group .
There is some controversy over what the real limit is , but more and more I 've found people are accepting this kind of limit . "
The study was published April 14 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Masters of memory
To prevent subjects from grouping or using other memory - aids , the researchers presented people with arrays of different - colored squares .
The subjects were then shown an array of the same squares without the colors .
Afterward , they were shown a single colored square in one location , and asked if the color matched that of the square in the same position at the beginning .
" What 's nice about this visual task that they used is that it really makes it difficult to use some of those common strategies that are helpful with verbal lists , " said Michael Kane , a psychologist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro , who was not involved in the new study .
" I think Cowan 's work has really been convincing in this . "
While the average person may only be able to hold three or four things in mind at once , some people have achieved amazing feats of working memory .
Contestants at the World Memory Championships ( most recently held in Bahrain in September 2007 ) often recall hundreds of digits in order after only five minutes .
But even these masters of memory seem to start with the same basic capacities as everyone else , and improve their abilities with strategies and tricks .
" A very famous study was a test done of a long - distance runner who learned to associate digits together in ways that were meaningful to him with respect to running times , " Kane said .
" He could repeat back lists of up to 80 digits in the right order , but if you gave him a list of words , he was at seven plus - or - minus two like everyone else . "
The new working memory study builds on previous research , but provides the most rigorous mathematical test of the three - to four - item estimate , Cowan said .
The team used a mathematical model that assumed people have a fixed number of slots in their working memory , each one of which can only hold one item .
When those slots are filled , the model predicted , people would make random guesses .
Based on this assumption , the model was able to forecast the various results of the trials with impressive accuracy .
" It is a pretty simple mathematical model but it predicted a very exquisite pattern of data , " Cowan told LiveScience .
" The results really were simple .
With a single value of working memory capacity we could really account for all those different scenarios . "
Working memory and intelligence
Although there seems to be a cap on the average number of things a person can remember at once , basic working memory capacity does vary among individuals .
Interestingly , those that test well on working memory tasks also seem to do well at learning , reading comprehension and problem solving .
" People accept that intelligence seems to be related to working memory , " Cowan said .
" The information you can hold in your mind at one time is the information you can interrelate .
If you have a better working memory we believe that your problem - solving abilities are better . "
Researchers do n't know what causes these variations in working - memory abilities — perhaps they are genetic , perhaps they arise from differences in early childhood environments or education .
The good news is people can improve their performance on certain working - memory tasks with training .
When children practice these tasks , over time they get better .
And not only do their scores on the memory tasks improve , but their scores on tests of attention and reasoning can also rise .
" The jury is still out on how useful this will be , but it 's at least suggestive that you can train skills at these tasks , and that this improvement can affect other things , " Kane said .
" We do n't know quite how they work together , but attention and working memory seem to be very close cousins . "
It 's all in there
Researchers debate the relationship between working memory and long - term memory .
While some hold that the two are independent storage facilities , others say working memory is simply the part of long - term memory that we can currently access .
Many scientists believe that almost all of our experiences are encoded into long - term memory , and that forgetting is simply a matter of not being able to access that memory .
" It 's in there somewhere , the problem is just getting to it , " Cowan said .
" Everything gets encoded into long - term memory almost immediately , but it gets encoded in a way that may not be distinct enough to be retrieved . "

Visitors and expatriates must complete full police registration procedures beginning July 1
June 5 – The Public Security Bureau issued new guidelines today to hotels and apartment management companies concerning the registration of foreigners in China , set to take effect July 1 .
The PSB , a part of China ’s domestic police force charged with policing public security and immigration residence registration and immigration affairs for foreigners , has insisted that the existing regulations for the registration of foreigners in China must be strictly adhered to .
Violators and those who fail to report , be they individuals or building management , will be subject to fines the bureau has said .
Hotels and serviced apartments
Guests must be registered upon arrival with the PSB by the hotel and if separate , serviced apartment management company .
Usually this procedure is automatic with input from the hotel being directly fed into the local PSB computer at the check - in procedure , with no additional action being required from the guest .
However , daily checks are now in operation with the PSB physically visiting hotels to request copies of the hotels in - house guest list to make sure they match the PSB ’s own records .
If they do not , the hotel / serviced apartment will be fined RMB5,000 per missing entry .
Hotel guests under these circumstances would not be fined .
However it does mean that foreigners wishing to stay at a hotel must provide full passport and visa credentials in order to check in .
A recent test check - in at hotels without a passport by China Briefing last week registered a 100 percent failure rate in the ten hotels tried .
All locations refused to check - in the guest despite despite rooms being available .
Foreign personnel living in private apartments
The apartment management company should be contacting foreign tenants / residents and requiring them to register with the local PSB .
If this is not done , both the management company and the foreigner can be fined RMB5,000 .
It is important to note that this rule applies to any foreign person living in any apartment or private dwelling – even if it is for just for one night .
If staying overnight or visiting friends in China , registration must be carried out upon arrival with the local PSB office responsible for the area .
We strongly recommend all foreign personnel living in apartments register with the local PSB prior to July 1 .
Foreign babies born in China
Registration of new babies born in China when taken home must also be registered with the PSB immediately or fines can be levied .

While working on a huge piece , that I 'd already gone over a few times , on the next pass I discovered I had edited a quote , rephrasing it for better readability .
( Okay , maybe only editors will snicker at that one . )
A few years ago my brother turned me on to Snopes , which debunks urban myths .
This is especially useful for those email forwards that we all get , which usually tell some fantastic story .
Fantastic and untrue .
When I cited Snopes to debunk some recent emails forwarded within my family ( one ascribing xenophobic comments to Australian former Prime Minister John Howard , but actually written by a home - grown racist ) , the family closed ranks in support of urban mythology .
( Not to defend John Howard – who is now facing war crimes charges in the International Criminal Court – he did make some of the comments in that viral email . )
But admittedly , pointing out factual reality when a storyteller is at work can feel a bit like raining on a parade .
I appreciate fine storytelling , and am ever amazed at human capacity for drama and exaggeration .
I just come from a place where I established a web reputation for factual accuracy , in a culture that predominantly gets its " news " from the corporate propaganda machine .
The best I can do with this critical eye , then , is focus it on the more humorous results when editors are ignored .
Here 's one that caught my eye today :
Westlake High School misspells ' education ' on diplomas ( June 5 , 2008 ) Ohio Principal Timothy Freeman says he sent the diplomas back once to correct another error .
When the corrected diplomas came back , no one bothered to check the things they thought were right the first time .
[ Editorial rewrite : ... says he returned the diplomas once to correct ... and change things to items ]

Microsoft 's been working on a Wiimote - esque controller due to come out late this year — development started on it all the way back in Summer ' 07 — but the whole process has been " a colossal clusterfuck . "
Here 's what MTV news knows courtesy of their exclusive source , who sketched out what it looks like above .

The 360 Wiimote shaped very much like the Nintendo Wii's Wiimote and has a speaker , microphone , four LED lights , A / B/X/Y face buttons , an analog stick and an underside trigger .
The Wiimote , on the other hand , does n't have a Microphone and has a D - pad instead of an analog stick .
It 's being worked on by Rare , who are trying to come up with a " unified interface and look for the controller . "
The current problem Microsoft 's having is between marketers and designers .
The former wants it just about exactly like the Wiimote so they can match them on spec sheets and lure game developers into porting over Wii games onto the 360 .
The designers want it to be even more feature - rich than just the Wii , and describe it as Halo , Gears and Forza " in waggle form . "
Microsoft is also working on their equivalent of the Nintendo Mii avatars to go along with this accessory , and will be ported into every game that uses the controller .
The problem with Microsoft porting characters around is that each one " standard look " and be somewhat generic .
On the other hand , Rare 's having much difficulty meeting their deadlines , which means that target date of end of 2008 could be hard to hit .

Hooked together in a single cluster , the PS3 consoles provide his department with the same amount of computing power as a 400 - node supercomputer .
" The challenge these days with supercomputing facilities is that there is a lot of demand for them .
So even if I submitted a job that would be expected to take about an hour , it could actually take two days to get started because the queues are so long .
" The PS3 cluster is all mine and was very low cost to set up , which makes it really attractive , " he says .
What makes the gaming console vastly superior to high - end computers for complex research algorithms , Mr Khanna says , is the Cell chip built by IBM to facilitate high - end gaming functions on the latest generation of consoles .
In addition the PS3 was built with an open hardware architecture , which can run the Linux operating system .
Based on Einstein 's theory of relativity , Mr Khanna 's research on black holes is purely theoretical .
In order to run his simulation data on the console he has to reprogram it so the algorithms will work on the new architecture .
" Linux can turn any system into a general purpose computer but for it to do work for me I have to run my own code on it for astrophysics applications .
The hard part of the job was to make sure my own calculations could run fast on the platform , which meant I had to optimise the written code so it could utilise the new features of the system .
" I am not a Linux person - I am a Mac person - but I was able to follow instructions online , " he says .
His next challenge will be to turn his data into graphical simulations using the high end graphics engine included in the PS3 .
" We have n't done that yet but it would be very neat to actually see the simulation while it is going on , " he says .
Although Mr Khanna was one of the first scientists to optimise the PS3 for his own research work , Tod Martinez , Professor of Chemistry at the University of Illinois has been tinkering with games consoles ever since his son's original PlayStation malfunctioned .
He says that while researching whether or not to buy a new PS2 for his son he also began to explore the possibilities of using gaming consoles for scientific research .
" The two main things we do are rotations and translations of objects .
We also need to get a lot of pixels onto the screen , which means we need big channels to move lots of data .
It was pretty clear that modern games consoles mapped really well onto theoretical chemical calculations , " he says .
Once the PS2 was released he bought one unit for his son and a few units for himself and made some rudimentary attempts to program it .
" But back then the architecture was proprietary and trying to convince the machine to run non-Sony programmed games was difficult . "
That situation improved rapidly when Sony released a DVD that would allow users to run Linux on the console .
" Only 1000 DVDs were released but they really opened up the architecture considerably , " he says .
Since that time Mr Martinez has refined his computing resources considerably and he now runs a cluster of eight cut - down consoles from IBM based on the same Cell chip technology used in the PS3 .
He has also expanded his use of gaming technology into graphics cards with the help of a new programming framework developed by graphics hardware specialist Nvidia .
Mr Martinez 's field of research is examining how molecules behave when you shine light on them - which has wide ramifications for the fields of agriculture , solar energy and the study of human vision .
" We have done tests of algorithms and Nvidia cards are four to five times faster than the Cell chip , which is 20 times faster than an ordinary high end computer , " he says .
Because both technologies can be classified as " stream processers " they are highly suited to moving massive volumes of data - unlike the general purpose processing for ordinary computing .
" Some people think it 's just about having a faster computer .
They do n't realise how big a change it is to do computing at your desk after accessing a computer in a room somewhere where you have to wait around for results .
" Of course it does cost less , but what needs to be recognised is that it also changes the way people think about problems when they are given a hundred times more computer power . "
Using the example of a black box , Mr Martinez explains that instead of asking basic questions about how it works , you can just start tinkering around with it .
" So rather than taking the thing apart you just start moving all the knobs about to see what happens when you change something - just as you might in real life . "

Puerto Triunfo , Colombia
Huge concrete dinosaurs tower over visitors to the estate Hacienda Napoles , a lush estate in Colombia , used to be home to one of the world 's richest and most feared criminals .
There he planned drug shipments and plotted murders , kidnappings and bombings .
On a recent sunny afternoon , Maria Claudia Gomez , a 24 - year - old university student from the nearby city of Medellin , sat by one if its two pools , enjoying the sun and warm water .
" This place is really nice and tranquil , " she said .
And of the estate 's founder , whom she called " kind of a hero " , she observed : " If one judges him by the estate , you have to say that he was a really intelligent guy . "
Killing spree Ms Gomez was talking about Pablo Escobar , one of recent history 's most vicious and successful criminal masterminds .
On this idyllic spot , just off the main road between Bogota and Medellin , with its swimming pools , mansions and exotic animal collection , few might disagree with her reflections .
But Escobar , the estate 's creator , made himself into history 's most successful drug trafficker by bribing , killing or kidnapping all who stood in his way and terrorising Colombia in the 1980s and early 1990s .
The drug - running plane above the entrance is gone
He bombed a passenger plane , as well as Colombia 's federal police headquarters , and paid bounties for the murders of policemen and members of rival drug cartels .
Estimates are difficult , but it is thought he was responsible for more than 4,000 deaths .
For Escobar , it at first paid off spectacularly , with Forbes magazine ranking him among the world 's 10 richest men in 1989 , when he was in his thirties .
Escobar purchased the 22sq km ( 8.4 sq miles ) Napoles Estate , about 320 km ( 200 miles ) from the capital Bogota , in 1978 .
He turned it into a fantasy land with concrete dinosaurs , a bullfighting ring and a private zoo that would have made Michael Jackson jealous , with giraffes , elephants , kangaroos and hippopotamuses .
To keep them company , he built a herd of concrete dinosaurs .
Above the entrance gate to the estate , the never - subtle Escobar put a plane he had used to smuggle cocaine into the US .
Public support
It was here that the drug baron entertained models , movie stars and the malleable politicians that he bribed and threatened into rewriting laws to his convenience .
Lucia Duque , a visitor from Medellin , Escobar 's native city , remembered the terror of his wars against the government and rival drug cartels .
" You could n't go to the police , " she said , " because a bomb might explode there . "
Escobar 's collection of vintage cars was destroyed after his death
At the same time , Escobar bought public support by lavishing his wealth onto Colombia 's many disenfranchised and unemployed .
He built houses for slum dwellers , installed lights on football pitches in poor neighbourhoods , and provided many jobs .
In Puerto Triunfo , a poor river town near the estate , residents miss Escobar and the work he gave locals as gardeners , construction workers and even tour guides .
Every Christmas , residents recall , Escobar sent truckloads of gifts for the town 's children .
In fact , Puerto Triunfo 's main street , which Escobar paved , is named Napoles Avenue .
" He lent us a hand when we needed it most , " said Jose Willian Rico , 38 , who did construction work for Escobar , but currently has no steady job .
Yet the town 's mayor , Javier Guerra , said Escobar left scars on the community .
" [ Escobar ] had a lot of people killed here , " said Mr Guerra .
" Where there was evil years ago , there is now progress and tourism , " he said .
Looted Colombian police , with US help , gunned Escobar down on a Medellin rooftop in 1993 .
Neighbouring peasants looted the mansions , dug up floors and knocked down walls and even the concrete dinosaurs , seeking gold , money or jewels they thought were stashed inside .
If they found anything , they did not say so publicly .
They also carried off everything they could , including doors , window frames and bathroom fixtures .
Escobar 's collection of vintage automobiles was torched .
Most of the exotic animals either starved to death or were given away to zoos .
The government settled several hundred peasant farmers on the estate , who continue to raise crops there on a remote section .
Finally , the provincial government decided to allow the estate to be developed as a theme park .
The manager , local hotel owner Oscar Jairo Orozco , started renovating the property late last year .
Now visitors can admire a new generation of exotic animals - many confiscated from the new generation of drug traffickers who replaced Escobar .
Also on display are hippopotamuses , three of which Escobar imported from Africa in 1984 .
The beasts have flourished , and now number 25 , making it the world 's largest wild hippo population outside of Africa .
Tourists can also ogle at the torched cars and pose for photos underneath the restored concrete brontosaurus and T - Rex - now playing recorded roars like those which might have sent terrified Jurassic animals scurrying for safety .
While most of the estate 's buildings have been restored , Escobar 's looted and sacked mansion still looks like it was hit by fire bombs .
Walking through its abandoned halls and rooms , Camila , a visitor from Bogota , reflected on the drug lord 's demise .
" He had so much money , " she said .
" And for what ?
They killed him like a dog on a rooftop . "
Folk hero ?
Over the years , time has faded recollections of Escobar 's terror , and popular memory has turned the drug lord into a sort of guardian angel for Colombia 's poor .
On the estate , the only written information on Escobar 's crimes is a sign on one of the destroyed mansion 's walls .
Visitors can now enjoy one of Escobar 's swimming pool
That bothers some visitors .
" I would think that maybe a lot of young people could think ' this is what I want to be like ' , " said Pablo , a shop owner from Medellin
In fact , some of the children visiting the estate had only admiration for the drug lord turned folk hero .
" He gave a lot of gifts to children , " said one boy when asked what he knew about Escobar .
As for Escobar 's penchant for murder , the children justified it as self - defence and then speculated that Escobar faked his death to escape and enjoy his riches .
But Mr Orozco says that a maximum - security prison being built nearby - and which visitors must pass on their way to the estate - stands as a lesson .
" I think that it 's a very clear message to society , that he who commits crimes , not only ends up losing his property , but can also end up in jail , " Mr Orozco said .

For US interrogators seeking to disorientate and break Iraqi prisoners it's ' torture lite ' - rock music played at excruciating volumes .
But while the song choices may sometimes verge on the unintentionally funny , this appropriation of music by the military is anything but a joke
According to US military authorities , it was God himself who first wrote the strategy of " torture by music " into the field manual - by turning the amplifier up to 11 on the enemy .
" Joshua 's army used horns to strike fear into the hearts of the people of Jericho , " retired US Air Force Lt - Col Dan Kuehl told the St Petersburg Times .
" His men might not have been able to break down literal walls with their trumpets , but the noise eroded the enemy 's courage . "
Kuehl , who teaches psychological operations ( or psyops ) at Fort McNair 's National Defense University in Washington DC , added , " Maybe those psychological walls were what really crumbled . "
It is not clear whether God would approve of the current US playlist : the number one slot is taken by the death metal band Deicide , whose track Fuck Your God is played at prisoners in Iraq .
That said , the proponents of torture by music doubtless think they have come a long way since the early 1990s , when the FBI blasted loud music at the Branch Davidians during the Waco siege in Texas .
The repertoire then included Sing - Along With Mitch Miller Christmas carols , an Andy Williams album and These Boots Are Made for Walking by Nancy Sinatra .
However unpleasant it may be to have such tunes blasted at your compound , bringing the music into an enclosed interrogation cell was a quantum leap in psyops .
Nonetheless , in the strange lexicon of 21st - century America , the US military calls this " torture lite " .
Torture is apparently OK if it is not too " heavy " .
Metallica 's Enter Sandman has been played at cacophonous levels for hours on end in Guantánamo Bay and at a detention centre on the Iraqi - Syrian border .
One Iraqi prisoner said it was done at " an unidentified location called ' the disco ' " .
Unfortunately , some artists are not offended by their work being used to torture .
" If the Iraqis are n't used to freedom , then I 'm glad to be part of their exposure , " James Hetfield , co-founder of Metallica , has said .
As for his music being torture , he laughed : " We 've been punishing our parents , our wives , our loved ones with this music for ever .
Why should the Iraqis be any different ? "
Such posturing may go with the territory for an artist of the Metallica genre , so there is no need to speculate about whether Hetfield is being naive or wilfully ignorant .
But no sane person voluntarily plays a single tune at earsplitting volume , over and over , 24 hours a day , and expects to stay sane .
Despite this , to date , the Pentagon 's semanticists have achieved their purpose , and many people think that torture by music is little more than a rather irritating enforced encounter with someone else 's iPod.
Binyam Mohamed , the British resident who is still held in Guantánamo Bay , knows a bit about such torture .
The CIA rendered him to Morocco , where his torturers repeatedly took a razor blade to his penis throughout an 18 - month ordeal .
When I later sat across from him in the cell , he described how psyops methods were worse than this .
He could anticipate physical pain , he said , and know that it would eventually end .
But the experience of slipping into madness as a result of torture by music was something quite different .
" Imagine you are given a choice , " he said .
" Lose your sight or lose your mind . "
While having your eyes gouged out would be horrendous , there is little doubt which you would choose .
Mohamed remains in Guantánamo .
The US military will decide , probably within two
weeks , whether to go forward with a military commission , based on " evidence " that was tortured out of him .
To those who have the misfortune to study torture , all this is old hat .
Members of the IRA interned in Northern Ireland in the 1970s recall the use of loud noise , piped into their cells , as the worst aspect of their ordeal .
One Guantánamo interrogator blithely estimated that it would take about four days to " break " someone , if the interrogation sessions were interspersed with strobe lights and loud music .
" Break " is another euphemism that is bandied about among torturers , as if " breaking " a person was some kind of psychological truth serum .
Of course , the " results " you get from a " broken " prisoner have little to do with truth .
Beyond pure barbarism , there are various reasons why music torture fails in its ambition .
As ever in this " war on terror " , there is a disconnect between the purported goal of the US forces ( " actionable intelligence " ) and the methods used to achieve it .
An order comes down from on high , from a Bush bureaucrat who has a bright idea , and it is left to soldiers in the field to use their imagination .
How some bored soldiers came up with David Gray 's song Babylon , played at Abu Ghraib jail in Iraq , defies analysis .
Sometimes , people simply misunderstand lyrics : in 1984 , Ronald Reagan tried to co-opt Bruce Springsteen 's Born in the USA as a patriotic anthem to get himself re-elected , despite the song being about government betrayal of Vietnam veterans .
Sometimes the selections used are wryly appropriate for prisoners being held without trial for years on end : Queen 's
We are the Champions ( " I 've paid my dues / Time after time / I 've done my sentence / But committed no crime " ) was a torturer 's favourite at Camp Cropper in Iraq .
Other songs unwittingly give voice to what could well be the prisoners ' inner thoughts : Rage Against the Machine 's Killing in the Name Of ( " Some of those that work forces , are the same that burn crosses ... / Fuck you , I wo n't do what you tell me ! " ) was used
at Guantánamo .
Inevitably , when poorly trained interrogators are encouraged to let their imaginations soar , they veer towards their own idiosyncratic perversions .
One budding Emcee artfully mixed the sound of crying babies ( which humans
seem hardwired to abhor ) with a television commercial for Meow Mix cat food .
Ultimately , though , the most overused torture song is I Love You by Barney the Purple Dinosaur .
On the face of it , the lyrics may seem deeply inappropriate : " I love you , you love me - we 're a happy family . / With a great big hug and a kiss from me to you , / Wo n't you say you love me too ? " , but anyone whose child watches the television programme will know how grating
it is .
In the torture trade , this is called " futility music " , designed to convince the prisoner of the futility of maintaining his position .
It is time that those musicians who oppose the use of music to torture fellow human beings made some noise - and they are beginning to .
This year 's Meltdown festival at London 's South Bank , which Massive Attack are curating , has highlighted the issue of torture by music .
Projections showing the horror of renditions and secret prisons will be used on their world tour .
When President Bush visited the UK at the weekend , we greeted him by playing the Barney the Purple Dinosaur theme tune .
What next ?
Perhaps the release of a special compilation : we could call it Now That 's What I Call Torture , President Bush 's selection of eight songs he would take to a desert island , and blast it at him for all eternity .
' It 's an issue that no one in the industry wants to deal with '
There is a clear reluctance within the record industry to discuss the use of music as torture .
The Guardian attempted to contact artists whose songs have reportedly been used by the US military in detainment camps - a diverse group that includes metal bands Metallica , AC / DC , Drowning
Pool and Deicide , hip - hop superstar Eminem , Bruce Springsteen , British singer - songwriter David Gray and the makers of children 's TV favourite Barney the Dinosaur .
In most cases , inquiries were met with a polite but firm " no comment " from management and PR representatives , or calls were simply not returned .
" It 's an issue that no one wants to deal with , " says David Gray , one of the few artists willing to speak about the subject .
" It 's shocking that there is n't more of an outcry .
I 'd gladly sign up to a petition that says do n't use my music , but it seems to be missing the point a bit . "
Gray 's music became associated with the torture debate after Haj Ali , the hooded man in the notorious Abu Ghraib photographs , told of being stripped , handcuffed and forced to listen to a looped sample of Babylon , at a volume so high he feared that his head would burst .
" The moral niceties of whether they 're using my song or not are totally irrelevant , " says Gray .
" We are thinking below the level of the people we 're supposed to oppose , and it goes against our entire history and everything we claim to represent .
It 's disgusting , really .
Anything that draws attention to the scale of the horror and how low we 've sunk is a good thing . "
The singer wonders whether governments who use music as a torture technique without asking permission from the artists involved could face legal action .
" In order to play something publicly , you have to have legal permission and you have to apply for that .
I wonder if the US government bothered , but I very much doubt it .
Perhaps you could sue , but let 's face it , they 're outside the law on the whole thing anyway . "
However , Gray 's anger is far from a universal reaction .
Steve Asheim , drummer for the death - metal band Deicide , questions whether music really counts as torture .
" Look at it this way , " he says .
" These guys are not a bunch
of high school kids .
They are warriors , and they 're trained to resist torture .
They 're expecting to be burned with torches and beaten and have their bones broken .
If I was a prisoner at Guantánamo Bay and they blasted a load of music at me , I 'd be like , ' Is this all you got ?
Come on . '
I certainly do n't believe in torturing people , but I do n't believe that playing loud music is torture either . "
Deicide 's Fuck Your God is said to be a favourite for military interrogators , and the song topped the infamous " torture playlist " compiled by the American investigative magazine Mother Jones .
It is worth noting that the lyrics are in fact anti-Christian , just as Bruce Springsteen 's Born in the USA and Eminem 's White America , also claimed as torture tracks , contain anti-establishment messages .
But , as Asheim points out , " Most people who listen
to this kind of music do n't give a shit about a political message .
They just wanna rock . "
Was the song specifically chosen for its sonic and cultural impact on detainees ?
Asheim does n't think so .
" I do n't believe there 's a room where they discuss what songs they can play to annoy the prisoners .
I think they just show up at work with whatever they 're listening to at the time .
There 's no shortage of metal - heads in the army , that 's for sure .
These guys who are going into battle , they 're not listening to Elton John beforehand . "
Asheim 's theory raises the question of how the apparently innocuous Barney the Dinosaur music made it into a field dominated by hip - hop and death metal .
Barney 's producers , HIT Entertainment , declined to comment for this article .
However , the creator of Barney 's song I Love You , Bob Singleton , admits he " just laughed " when he heard it was being used by interrogators .
" It seemed so ludicrous that something totally innocuous for children could threaten the mental state of an adult , " he says .
" I would rate the annoyance factor to be about equal with hearing my neighbour 's leaf blower .
It can set my teeth on edge , but it wo n't break me down and make me confess to crimes against humanity .
Will Barney songs break your psyche ?
I think that idea turns music into something like voodoo , which it certainly is n't .
If that were true , then the inverse would be true .
Playing hymns to someone strapped to a chair would n't make them a Christian . "
Singleton , a classically trained composer , wrote and produced for the TV series Barney and Friends between 1990 and 2000 .
He says that the morality of what is done with his music once it is out of his hands is beyond his control .
" I would find it unfortunate that one of my works for kids was used as the underscore for a stripper , for example .
I would prefer that my music for Barney is put to its best use with children , but beyond that there 's not much I can do .
Plus , we 're not talking about dynamite or nuclear devices here .
Music is just music .
It 's supposed to touch your mind , your body , and your emotions to varying degrees ; but it does n't fundamentally change people .
I think that gives it much more credit than it deserves . "
Paul Arendt

Italians were curious to see how much their neighbours earned
There has been outrage in Italy after the outgoing government published every Italian 's declared earnings and tax contributions on the internet .
The tax authority 's website was inundated by people curious to know how much their neighbours , celebrities or sports stars were making .
The Italian treasury suspended the website after a formal complaint from the country 's privacy watchdog .
The information was put on the site with no warning for nearly 24 hours .
Sour grapes ?
The release of the information was one of the last acts of the outgoing centre - left government and has shocked many tax - shy Italians , says the BBC's Mark Duff in Milan .
But it was also hugely popular , and within hours the site was overwhelmed and impossible to access .
The finance ministry described the move as a bid to improve transparency .
Deputy Economic Minister Vincenzo Visco said he could not understand what all the fuss was about .
" I ca n't understand what the problem is , " he is quoted as telling Italy 's Corriere della Sera newspaper .
" This already exists all around the world , you just have to watch any American soap to see that .
We had the system ready by January but we delayed publication to avoid arguments during the election campaign . "
But critics condemned it as an outrageous breach of privacy .
HAVE YOUR SAY I 'd hate for my salary to be made public Gary , UK
The timing of the move , just days before the current administration hands over to incoming Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , was intriguing too , says our correspondent .
The outgoing government came to power promising to tackle Italians ' notoriously lax approach to paying tax .
According to an Italian government report from 2007 , the amount of unpaid tax in the country is equivalent to 7 % of gross domestic product .
Some sceptics have seen the move as just end of term sour grapes , our correspondent adds .

Color Oregon blue ?
A fairly stunning new ad from Oregon 's Republican senator Gordon Smith leaves little doubt as to which way the wind is blowing there .
In the ad , Smith , running hard away from Bush , associates himself at length and explicitly with Obama .
" Who says Gordon Smith helped lead the fight for better gas mileage and a cleaner environment ? " the female narrator asks .
" Barack Obama . "
The ad shows Obama 's face and an image of his website .
" I approve working together across party lines and this ad , " Smith closes .
Smith was an early McCain endorser .
UPDATE : Obama spokesman Bill Burton responds :
Barack Obama has a long record of bipartisan accomplishment and we appreciate that it is respected by his Democratic and Republican colleagues in the Senate .
But in this race , Oregonians should know that Barack Obama supports Jeff Merkley for Senate .
Merkley will help Obama bring about the fundamental change we need in Washington .
While yesterday the world was ogling over the iPhone 3G black body , some people were just awing over black balls .
400,000 of them .
Black balls everywhere , bouncing , swinging , cavorting , happily hopping down the side of the Ivanhoe Reservoir with two objectives .
First , to fight bromate by stopping sunlight , which forms this carcinogenic component mixing the chlorine and bromide in the water .
Second , to let me use " bouncy black balls " in a headline .

The move to deploy the balls — 3,000,000 will follow soon — comes after Los Angeles Department of Water and Power officials registered high levels of bromate between June and October 2007 .
Although these were n't dangerous enough to put the population in risk or call Jack Bauer , the department thought that it would better to be safe than sorry .

I was n't really looking for a new job a few months ago when I received an email from Eric Scheide ( see Team Bios ) , the CTO at craigslist .
He mentioned that they were looking for someone with MySQL experience and asked if I knew anyone .
This sort of thing happens all the time .
But this time it was different .
Over the course of about three seconds , something clicked in my little brain and I realized that craigslist is a pretty unique combination of things : a small company with a solid financial base , a great service that I use myself , a focused groups of people who really care about doing things well , and an open - source friendly environment .
I replied that I might be interested myself and things kind of took on a life of their own from there .
In the weeks that followed , I got the chance to meet much of the team ( including CEO Jim Buckmaster and Craig himself ) .
Each time I came away liking more and more about the team .
I 've also been impressed at how well the company takes care of its people and how thoughtful they are about making important decisions .
So after taking a few weeks off for some planned travel and unplanned relaxation , I 'll start assimilating myself into the craigslist engineering culture and lending a hand wherever I can .
Yes , some of that will entail going back to my MySQL roots .
The site is growing like a weed ( still ! ) , the people are great , and the focus is on providing a great service that anyone can use .
At the same time , there are a lot of technical challenges ( they get a ton of page views ) and great opportunities to grow the site and give back to both the open source community and all the communities around the world that craigslist serves - - a list that 's growing all the time .
Not that I really care much what other people think , but the reactions I 've had so far when telling people have been universally positive .
Very positive .
That tells me I 'm on the right track .
The only real downside is that crigslist is in San Francisco and I 'm in San Jose .
So if you have thoughts on getting to the vicinity of 9th and Judah using public transit , let me know .
I wo n't be commuting up every day , but I suspect I 'll be trying a few options before settling on what works best .

WHEN your Moscow office is raided by Russia 's security services , a court in Siberia imposes an injunction on your staff and your work permits are denied , you can tell you have upset someone .
But who , and how ?
That is what BP , a British oil firm which owns 50 % of TNK - BP , a joint venture with a Russian firm , has been trying to find out .
The firm has been under pressure from the Russian authorities before .
The threat of losing its licence for the giant Kovykta field in East Siberia persuaded it to sell 63 % to Gazprom , the state gas monopoly .
Given the dire state of Russian - British relations and the state 's distaste for foreign ownership of its oil reserves , it seemed natural to suspect the Kremlin when BP ran into visa problems in March .
The arrest of a TNK - BP employee on espionage charges heightened such suspicions .
But this neat picture has just been dispelled by Robert Dudley , the boss of TNK - BP , who blames BP 's recent troubles on its Russian partners .
They are Mikhail Fridman , the head of Alfa Group , and his partners Viktor Vekselberg and Leonard Blavatnik , who are collectively known as the AlfaAccessRenova consortium .
In an interview with Vedomosti , a Russian business daily , Mr Dudley said there were disagreements between TNK - BP 's shareholders , and that managers had deliberately filed incorrect visa applications for 150 of TNK - BP 's foreign staff .
Separately , an obscure Moscow brokerage , called Tetlis , filed a lawsuit in Siberia claiming that TNK - BP 's payments to BP contractors amounted to extra dividends , and secured an injunction barring BP staff from TNK - BP .
According to Tetlis 's website , two of its three top managers used to work for Mr Fridman 's Alfa Group .
The Russian shareholders want Mr Dudley out , and walked out of talks with Tony Hayward , the head of BP , after he refused to give in .
On Thursday June 5th Mr Hayward arrived in Russia for more talks with shareholders and government officials .
He used a speech at the annual general meeting of Rosneft , a state - controlled firm , to give warning that the country 's success depends on the “ consistent application of the rule of law ” .
He also met Igor Sechin , the deputy prime minister responsible for energy , among other officials , and was expected to meet Mr Fridman .
So what is behind the hostility ?
People close to BP say the Russian oligarchs are up to their old tricks again , and are trying to exploit Russia 's weak institutions and take control .
Russian business practices can be ( and often are ) shockingly crude .
But the Russian shareholders claim to have a genuine grievance .
They say BP treats TNK - BP as a subsidiary , rather than an independent company run for the benefit of all shareholders .
They say BP cares more about its oil reserves than costs or profits .
TNK - BP provides 40 % of BP 's replacement reserves and 25 % of its oil production .
The Russians would like TNK - BP to expand abroad , but that would turn it into a rival to BP .
A recent memo from Mr Dudley , seen by The Economist , bars managers from discussing deals in countries blacklisted by America 's state department , including Cuba , Iran and Syria .
“ TNK - BP is an independent Russian company and should be subject to Russian laws , ” says Mr Fridman .
Russian shareholders also object to TNK - BP 's payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to BP contractors , citing a conflict of interest .
“ There is certainly room for cost cutting in TNK - BP , ” says Ivan Mazalov , a fund manager at Prosperity Capital Management , a minority shareholder .
In any other country this would have been an ordinary shareholder dispute , but in Russia , politics always get in the way .
The picture has been muddied by Gazprom , which has signalled its intention to buy out the Russian shareholders in TNK - BP and form its own partnership with the British firm .
BP seems to like the idea and has engaged in negotiations .
Gazprom had also proposed an option for BP to buy back 25 % of the Kovykta field in return for some valuable assets outside Russia .
People close to BP say the deal is being held up by the Russian shareholders ' reluctance to sell their stake in TNK - BP and the recent hostilities are simply a negotiating ploy .
Given Gazprom 's political power , they and many others assume that the Russian shareholders will have to sell .
Yet Gazprom , which has huge debts , does not have the free cash to buy them out .
( TNK - BP could be worth up to $ 60 billion . )
Mr Fridman , who also has powerful patrons in the Kremlin , says nobody has asked him about the sale of his stake — and even if they did , he would not sell .
Navigating Russian politics when nobody knows who really runs the country is a futile task .
The two sides would be better off sticking to business .
Dumbing Down the Presidency
WASHINGTON -- People campaign for the presidency by talking their heads off .
By the time the winner reaches the White House , the habit is so ingrained that it is impossible to shake .
The result has been what professor Jeffrey Tulis of the University of Texas 21 years ago labeled " the rhetorical presidency , " his term for an office in which the principal goal is to mobilize public opinion successfully enough to dominate the dealings with Congress and even foreign powers .
Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were , for most of their tenures , masters of the art .
George W. Bush had early success , but now has lost most of his audience and , with it , his sway .
Now , another scholar , Elvin T. Lim of Wesleyan University , has offered a revision of the Tulis theory that sheds fascinating and disturbing light on the torrent of communications that are unleashed by the " communicator in chief . "
In a slim book titled " The Anti-Intellectual Presidency , " he argues that the real problem is not the increased quantity of words coming out of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave .
but the sharp decline in content -- especially of logical argument .
Peggy Noonan , the former Reagan speechwriter who was one of 42 such people interviewed by Lim , said the result of this decline is that " the only organ to which no appeal is made these days -- you might call it America 's only understimulated organ -- is the brain . "
Complaints about vacuous official rhetoric and the " dumbing - down " of presidential speeches , news conferences and interviews are standard fare .
Lim found strong evidence to support those complaints , not just in his interviews with the retired speechwriters , but in the presidential texts themselves .
In what must have been a heroic effort , he applied standard techniques of content analysis to state papers of every president from Washington to the second Bush .
His tool is something called the Flesch Readability score -- a measure of the average number of words per sentence and the average number of syllables per word .
The higher the Flesch score , the simpler to get the meaning .
Applied to the annual State of the Union addresses , the average score has doubled from the first few presidents to the last few .
Those " messages were pitched at a college level through most of the 18th and 19th centuries , " Lim says .
" They have now come down to an eighth - grade reading level . "
The same trend , but more pronounced , is found in Inaugural addresses .
Their average sentence length has dropped from 60 words to 20 .
Simplification has its advantages , if it serves to increase public comprehension .
But it comes with a huge risk : the complexity of real - world choices can be , and often is , lost .
I remember my shock 50 years ago when I came to Washington from Bloomington , Ill. , where I had been hearing a lot about the debate over federal aid to education .
When I got here , I learned for the first time that the federal government had been subsidizing education for a century .
The real debate was :
How much subsidy , distributed how , and under what regulations ?
All of that substance was missing in the speeches I had heard in Bloomington ; much the same thing is happening now , when it comes to No Child Left Behind .
But the problem Lim sees is more than dumbing down .
" As presidents have taken the rhetorical path of least resistance by serving up simplistic sentences to citizens , they have correspondingly offered an easily digestible substantive menu devoid of argument and infused with inspirational platitudes , partisan punch lines and emotional and human - interest appeals . "
These trends , too , are charted by Lim .
Basically what has happened , he shows , is that rather than seeking to persuade voters by arguing for their policies , presidents increasingly have sought to build trust by identifying themselves with those voters and their " common sense " view of the world .
" Whereas all of the presidents through Woodrow Wilson appealed to ' common sense ' just 11 times in their recorded papers , presidents since Wilson have done so more than 1,600 times , " he writes .
Lim knows that the forces feeding the trends he describes will not easily be reversed .
But he calls on politicians to think on their role as educators of the public , and on the public to demand straight talk from those who would be president .
Seems obvious to me :
“ I reject the notion that Al Qaeda is waiting for ‘ the big one ’ or holding back an attack , ” Sheehan writes .
“ A terrorist cell capable of attacking does n’t sit and wait for some more opportune moment .
It ’s not their style , nor is it in the best interest of their operational security .
Delaying an attack gives law enforcement more time to detect a plot or penetrate the organization . ”
Terrorism is not about standing armies , mass movements , riots in the streets or even palace coups .
It ’s about tiny groups that want to make a big bang .
So you keep tracking cells and potential cells , and when you find them you destroy them .
After Spanish police cornered leading members of the group that attacked trains in Madrid in 2004 , they blew themselves up .
The threat in Spain declined dramatically .
Indonesia is another case Sheehan and I talked about .
Several high - profile associates of bin Laden were nailed there in the two years after 9/11 , then sent off to secret CIA prisons for interrogation .
The suspects are now at Guantánamo .
But suicide bombings continued until police using forensic evidence — pieces of car bombs and pieces of the suicide bombers — tracked down Dr. Azahari bin Husin , “ the Demolition Man , ” and the little group around him .
In a November 2005 shootout the cops killed Dr. Azahari and crushed his cell .
After that such attacks in Indonesia stopped .
The drive to obliterate the remaining hives of Al Qaeda training activity along the Afghanistan - Pakistan frontier and those that developed in some corners of Iraq after the U.S. invasion in 2003 needs to continue , says Sheehan .
It ’s especially important to keep wanna - be jihadists in the West from joining with more experienced fighters who can give them hands - on weapons and explosives training .
When left to their own devices , as it were , most homegrown terrorists ca n’t cut it .
For example , on July 7 , 2005 , four bombers blew themselves up on public transport in London , killing 56 people .
Two of those bombers had trained in Pakistan .
Another cell tried to do the same thing two weeks later , but its members had less foreign training , or none .
All the bombs were duds .
[…]
Sir David Omand , who used to head Britain ’s version of the National Security Agency and oversaw its entire intelligence establishment from the Cabinet Office earlier this decade , described terrorism as “ one corner ” of the global security threat posed by weapons proliferation and political instability .
That in turn is only one of three major dangers facing the world over the next few years .
The others are the deteriorating environment and a meltdown of the global economy .
Putting terrorism in perspective , said Sir David , “ leads naturally to a risk management approach , which is very different from what we ’ve heard from Washington these last few years , which is to ‘ eliminate the threat ’ . ”
Yet when I asked the panelists at the forum if Al Qaeda has been overrated , suggesting as Sheehan does that most of its recruits are bunglers , all shook their heads .
Nobody wants to say such a thing on the record , in case there ’s another attack tomorrow and their remarks get quoted back to them .
That ’s part of what makes Sheehan so refreshing .
He knows there ’s a big risk that he ’ll be misinterpreted ; he ’ll be called soft on terror by ass- covering bureaucrats , breathless reporters and fear - peddling politicians .
And yet he charges ahead .
He expects another attack sometime , somewhere .
He hopes it wo n’t be made to seem more apocalyptic than it is .
“ Do n’t overhype it , because that ’s what Al Qaeda wants you to do .
Terrorism is about psychology . ”
In the meantime , said Sheehan , finishing his fruit juice , “ the relentless 24/ 7 job for people like me is to find and crush those guys . ”
Overview
JUNG  the Java Universal Network / Graph Framework -- is a software library that provides a common and extendible language for the modeling , analysis , and visualization of data that can be represented as a graph or network .
It is written in Java , which allows JUNG - based applications to make use of the extensive built - in capabilities of the Java API , as well as those of other existing third - party Java libraries .
The JUNG architecture is designed to support a variety of representations of entities and their relations , such as directed and undirected graphs , multi-modal graphs , graphs with parallel edges , and hypergraphs .
It provides a mechanism for annotating graphs , entities , and relations with metadata .
This facilitates the creation of analytic tools for complex data sets that can examine the relations between entities as well as the metadata attached to each entity and relation .
The current distribution of JUNG includes implementations of a number of algorithms from graph theory , data mining , and social network analysis , such as routines for clustering , decomposition , optimization , random graph generation , statistical analysis , and calculation of network distances , flows , and importance measures ( centrality , PageRank , HITS , etc. ) .
JUNG also provides a visualization framework that makes it easy to construct tools for the interactive exploration of network data .
Users can use one of the layout algorithms provided , or use the framework to create their own custom layouts .
In addition , filtering mechanisms are provided which allow users to focus their attention , or their algorithms , on specific portions of the graph .
As an open - source library , JUNG provides a common framework for graph / network analysis and visualization .
We hope that JUNG will make it easier for those who work with relational data to make use of one anothers ' development efforts , and thus avoid continually re-inventing the wheel .

Hillary Clinton is bowing out of her 2008 race for the Presidency .
She ca n’t seem to make her departure , so she is making moves toward making her departure .
I vowed 15 years ago not to write much about her , and I have n’t .
I thought she got a bum steer from a bum husband , who treated her about as badly as any man can treat his wife without physically brutalizing her .
So , I did my best to ignore her .
She is not easy to ignore .
Her plight is a case study of a problem that faces most people at some point , and faces internally driven people repeatedly : when to quit .
It ’s more than bowing out gracefully .
It ’s bowing out at all .
We teach our children to adopt perseverance .
It ’s a good quality .
Given the fact that most problems that a person has the courage to take on will eventually be solved , perseverance pays off .
But not always .
I have a friend from my early teens who has a vision for a software product he has been working on .
He thinks it will save the world .
I do not exaggerate .
This is what he thinks .
He has worked on it for at least a decade .
He has spent all of his retirement money to develop it .
I still do n’t know what it is .
He wo n’t say , exactly .
I have seen bits and pieces of it .
My view is that if I ca n’t figure out what it is supposed to do , let alone how , it probably wo n’t save the world .
The last time I spoke with him , he was ready to mortgage his home to fund further development .
He is in his seventies .
He should quit .
He should have quit before he spent his retirement money .
He is n’t in this just for the money .
He has a much larger goal .
He is not so foolish as to think it ’s a good bargain to gain the whole world and lose your soul .
But he thinks he can save his soul — or at least guarantee it — by having his program gain the whole world .
I think he ’s wrong .
I had another friend , Otto Scott .
Otto was a great writer .
He coined the phrase “ the silent majority , ” and put it into the mouth of the chairman of Ashland Oil .
About sixty years ago , he and a group of entrepreneurs had an idea for a credit card that a person could use instead of cash at restaurants .
They took this idea to a number of venture capitalists .
Every one of them said the idea would not fly .
Scott ’s group dropped the project .
Within two years , the first Diners Club card was issued .
Scott turned a lemon into lemonade .
The experience taught him a lesson : smart men can be very foolish .
Over 25 years later , he began a book - writing project .
In private , he called it the Sacred Fools project .
He wrote three books based on the theme of smart men who do incomparably foolish things : ( 1 ) The Secret Six , the story of the Unitarian activists who financed John Brown ; ( 2 ) James I , the debauched but brilliant king , after whom the King James Bible is named ; ( 3 ) Robespierre , the so - called voice of virtue who established France ’s reign of terror in 1794 .
The fourth volume was never completed : a biography of Woodrow Wilson , who surely was America ’s most influential sacred fool .
For my assessment of Wilson ’s legacy , click here .
In the case of each of these sacred fools , the world would have been much better off if they had quit . . . a lot earlier .
But they persevered .
Their success was our loss .
SIGNS THAT IT ’S TIME TO QUITSeek counsel .
It may be bad , as the counsel Scott and his associates received was bad , but seeking counsel is wise .
Where no counsel is , the people fall : but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety ( Proverbs 11:14 )
If they tell you to quit , compare their reasons .
If the reasons are similar , and all of the counsellors have had successes in the field , take them seriously .
Think through their reasons .
Do they make sense ?
Most projects fail .
Forecasting failure is n’t a good enough reason .
Identifying the roadblocks to success and pointing to a lack of resources to overcome them is a good reason to stop the project early .
For which of you , intending to build a tower , sitteth not down first , and counteth the cost , whether he have sufficient to finish it ?
Lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him , Saying , This man began to build , and was not able to finish ( Luke 14:28 — 30 ) .
The Diners Club story is worth recounting .
The creator had an experience that convinced him to move forward .
He had been at a restaurant , and he had almost been unable to pay .
He realized that he needed a back - up source of funds .
He made the mental leap from gasoline service stations to the restaurant .
Service stations had been issuing cards for three decades .
But the cards were good only in one brand of station .
So , he moved from a real - world problem to a solution based on a real - world solution in a completely different market .
The gasoline credit card was convenient for the buyer , but it was vital for the retailer , who locked in a customer .
The Diners Club developer saw a way to sell the idea to retailers : more customers .
Visa and MasterCard did not arrive for another 16 years .
The opportunity was in front of them , but they did not perceive it .
When they finally did , Diners Club was a victim .
So was the solvency of millions of buy now - pay later consumers .
Here are some rough rules of thumb to consider before committing too much to a project .
Is a problem worth solving if no one but you ever recognizes that it has been solved ?
If not , limit your commitment .
If you have to fund it yourself , why do you think anyone will pay you back ?
Who , How Much ?
If you were to be remembered for only one thing , is this project the thing you would choose ?
Will they remember your failure ?
If so , it ’s a very big project .
Be prepared .
If it is n’t completed , will anyone ’s life be significantly worse off , other than yours ?
If you do n’t do it , who can ?
Will he ?
If he does n’t , would this be bad for the world ?
Has it been attempted before ?
If so , what killed it ?
Is it so important that if your worst enemy pulled it off , would you still be glad the project was completed ?
Would you still do it if there were no monetary payoff ?
I have a project like this .
When you adopt a project like this , limit your commitment , either financially or in terms of a time schedule .
My main project , my economic commentary on the Bible , has a time limit : age 70 .
The trouble is , that will complete only stage one .
Then I have at least four major book projects that will flow out of it .
Plus video .
Plus audio .
Plus a curriculum .
Maybe two .
CONCLUSION
There comes a time to quit .
If you stay on the project too long , it will keep you from completing any other project .
That is a very high cost .
I think Hillary Clinton stayed in to the bitter end because she has no fall - back lifetime project .
Being a dutiful wife to Bill surely is n’t high on her list .
She poured her book royalty money into the bottomless pit of her now - dead campaign .
What is next ?
Nothing much .
When your life is defined as one major project vs. nothing much , you need a fall - back project .
Your vision is too narrow .
Your risks are too great .
You wo n’t quit in time .

Renowned scientist Albert Einstein dismissed the Bible as a collection of " pretty childish " legends and belief in God as a " product of human weaknesses , " according to a letter to be auctioned this week .
Einstein , who was Jewish , also rejects the notion that Jews were God ’s chosen people .
The letter was written in German in 1954 to philosopher Eric Gutkind .
It is to be auctioned in London , England , on Thursday by Bloomsbury Auctions , and is expected to fetch between $ 12,000 and $ 16,000 US .
Einstein writes " the word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses , the Bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish . "
Born to a Jewish family in Germany in 1879 , he also adds that " for me , the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions . "
He also wrote " the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong , and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people .
" As far as my experience goes , they are also no better than other human groups , although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power .
Otherwise I can not see anything ' chosen ' about them . "
Einstein ' rather quirky about religion ' : expert
Many have speculated about the religious or spiritual beliefs of the Nobel Prize - winning physicist , whose theory of relativity revolutionized the study of physics .
Some have pointed to Einstein ’s quote that God " does not play dice " with the universe ( his rejection of the randomness of the universe ) as proof of his belief in a higher being .
Others have said that the quote does not advocate a belief in God and have referred to other letters written by Einstein .
" I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly , " he wrote in another letter in 1954 .
" If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it . "
John Brooke , professor emeritus of science and religion at Oxford University , told the Associated Press that the letter lends weight to the notion that " Einstein was not a conventional theist " — although he was not an atheist , either .
" Like many great scientists of the past , he is rather quirky about religion , and not always consistent from one period to another , " Brooke said
Brooke said Einstein believed " there is some kind of intelligence working its way through nature .
But it is certainly not a conventional Christian or Judaic religious view . "
Bloomsbury spokesman Richard Caton said the auction house was " 100 per cent certain " of the letter 's authenticity .
It is being offered at auction for the first time by a private vendor .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli leaders shunned former U.S. President Jimmy Carter during a visit because of his plans to meet Hamas and Israel ’s secret service declined to assist U.S. agents guarding him , U.S. sources said on Monday .
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter ( C ) visits a police station in the southern Israeli town of Sderot April 14 , 2008 , where remains of rockets , launched by Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip , are kept .

“ They ’re not getting support from local security , ” one of the sources said , on condition of anonymity .
An American source described as “ unprecedented ” the lack of Shin Bet cooperation with the U.S. Secret Service , which protects all current and former U.S. presidents , as well as Israeli leaders when they visit the United States .
Carter , who brokered Israel ’s first peace treaty with an Arab neighbor , Egypt , signed in 1979 , met Israel ’s largely ceremonial president , Shimon Peres , on Sunday .
But Israel ’s political leadership , including Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , steered clear of the Nobel Peace Prize winner .
The former U.S. leader has angered the Israeli government over plans to meet Hamas ’ top leader , Khaled Meshaal , in Syria , and for describing Israeli policy in the occupied Palestinian territories as “ a system of apartheid ” in a 2006 book .
An Israeli security source said the Shin Bet security service provided no protection to Carter during his visit to the Jewish state because no request was made .
Asked about the Israeli account , Carter ’s delegation , which had previously declined to comment , told Reuters in a statement : “ The Carter delegation inquired with both the lead agent of the Secret Service detail ( protecting Carter ) and the State Department Regional Security Officer and were told unequivocally that an official request for assistance had been made . ”
American sources close to the matter said the Shin Bet , which helps protect visiting dignitaries and is overseen by Olmert ’s office , declined to meet the head of Carter ’s Secret Service detail or provide his team with assistance as is customary during such visits .

PROGRESS WELCOME
Israel and the United States have sought to isolate Hamas , which seized control of the Gaza Strip in June from more secular Fatah forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
Abbas holds sway in the occupied West Bank and has launched U.S. - backed peace talks with Olmert .
The Bush administration and Israel oppose Carter ’s planned meeting with Meshaal , whose Islamist group won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 but was boycotted by the West for refusing to renounce violence and recognize Israel .
Carter has defended talks with Hamas as an opportunity to gauge the group ’s willingness to accept Arab peace overtures .
U.N. humanitarian affairs chief John Holmes told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York it would be positive if Carter ’s talks with Hamas could achieve a breakthrough .
“ Anything which will help to produce some political progress ... would be extremely welcome and if Jimmy Carter can achieve that by talking to Hamas , why not ? ” he said .
Holmes added the United Nations was not in a position to engage in political discussions with Hamas , though U.N. humanitarian officials were in touch with the group at a practical level to carry out aid work in Gaza when necessary .
Carter visited the Israeli border town of Sderot on Monday and said he was “ distressed ” by cross - border rockets fired by militants in the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip .
“ I think it ’s a despicable crime for any deliberate effort to be made to kill innocent civilians , ” Carter said , adding that he hoped a ceasefire would be reached soon .
Hamas leaders have offered a long - term truce with Israel in return for a viable Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip , but the group ’s 1988 founding charter calls for the destruction of the Jewish state .
Israel said it rejected Carter ’s request to meet jailed Palestinian uprising leader Marwan Barghouthi , who is seen as a possible successor to Abbas .
Barghouthi was convicted in 2004 of murder by an Israeli court over the killing of four Israelis and a Greek Orthodox monk in attacks by Palestinian militants .
He is serving five life sentences .
Nothing is better than finishing a brilliant science fiction novel knowing that it is only the first in a series .
Some of the greatest minds in sci- fi have used the series format to create complex and thrilling universes for their story characters to exist in , while others have created dystopian ( and utopian ) future environments on earth .
This list takes the best of the science fiction series genre and attempts to rank them – a difficult ( and obviously subjective ) task .
For your reading pleasure , here are the 15 greatest science fiction book series .
15 Vorkosigan Saga Lois McMaster Bujold
The bulk of the Vorkosigan Saga concerns Miles Vorkosigan , a disabled aristocrat from the planet Barrayar whose entire life is a challenge to the prejudices of his native planet against “ mutants ” .
The novels The Vor Game , Barrayar , and Mirror Dance each won the Hugo Award for Best Novel , while Falling Free , Memory , and A Civil Campaign were nominated but did not win .
The series makes travel between star systems possible through the use of wormholes ( spatial anomalies that exist in five spatial dimensions ) – enabling instantaneous travel .
The inhabited systems are known collectively as the Wormhole Nexus .

13 Hyperion Cantos Dan Simmons
Simmons ’
Cantos is one of the most well known science fiction series of the last two decades .
It is set in the far future and focuses heavily on plot and story development , giving a much lesser role to technical detail .
It would be considered soft science fiction and is often described as “ space opera ” .
Of the four novels in the series , Hyperion received the Hugo Award for best Novel and The Fall of Hyperion was nominated for the Nebula Award for best novel .
Hyperion is home to the Time Tombs , large artifacts that allow people to travel back and forth in time .
The region where the tombs are found is also the home of the Shrike , a menacing being that appears throughout the series .

12 The Space Odyssey series Arthur C Clarke
This is , perhaps , the most well known of the series on this list due to the commercial success of the film 2001 , a Space Odyssey .
The whole series was originally sparked off by a short story by Clarke , which he later evolved in to a full length novel in conjunction with the production of the movie by Stanley Kubrick .
The series combines science fiction and metaphysics .
Because the stories and settings of the various books and films diverge , Clarke stated that the continuity of the series represents occurrences in a set of parallel universes .

11 The Culture Iain Banks
The Culture is an anarchistic , socialistic , and utopian society set in the future .
It is a “ post - scarcity ” society – meaning that it is is set in a time in which man has overcome all of the problems of poverty and need in the world – as well as eradicating death and disease .
It is a totally egalitarian state , requiring no use of force or compulsion except when necessary for the protection of others .
The novels deal mostly with people living on the fringes of this society – diplomats , spies , and mercenaries – those who do the dirty work of the culture .

10 Rama Series Arthur C Clarke , Gentry Lee
Rendezvous with Rama ( the first in the Rama series ) was published in 1972 .
It is set in the 22nd century when a thirty mile long cylindrical object passes through the solar system of Earth .
It is revealed to be an alien starship and man decides to intercept it in order to unlock its mysteries .
This is a brilliant book and it was accordingly given both the Hugo and Nebula awards upon its release .
It is considered to be one of the cornerstones of Clarke ’s total output and is seen as a science fiction classic .
Under pressure to produce a sequel , Clarke teamed up with Gentry Lee to write the remainder of the series .
Lee did the majority of the work and Clarke merely looked over and edited the writing .

A Princess of Mars was probably the first 20th century fictional work to feature a constructed language .
Its influence can be clearly seen in both the Star Trek and Farscape franchises .
While many of the tales appear to be rather dated today , they were extremely innovative in their time and they helped to inspire serious interest in Mars and space exploration .

So we 've got it on authority that the second - gen iPhone is already well into testing , and numerous units are floating around in super secret pockets .
A trusted source got a chance to check one out , here 's what we 've heard .
The first thing people will notice : the 2nd gen iPhone will be about the same size and shape as the first gen .
It will , of course , have 3G .
And proper GPS !
The most noticeable physical difference is back of the phone is no longer metal -- the whole thing is glossy black , from top to bottom .
The volume buttons are now chrome .
Because it 's got a little less metal to deal with , it does n't have quite as many angular edges .
The battery is ( still ) not removable .
The phone itself will be slightly thicker than the first gen device .
The headphone jack will no longer be recessed , and will finally be flush with the body .
The device itself uses roughly the same size and resolution screen as the first generation product .
No solid word on battery life or storage capacity .
It could ship ( or be introduced ) as early as July -- but it 's worth noting that none of this is necessarily finalized , and any of it could change between now and its introduction .
You really never know with Apple !
P.S. - Image via iPod Observer , MacRumors points out it 's probably just a case ( which we 'd likely agree with ) ; we 're not by any means claiming the image above is the new iPhone , just an example of what it could look like given the info we received .
Is Income Volatility Really Rising ?
For Whom ?
Jacob Hacker ‘s Great Risk
Shift described rising income risk over recent decades as an important and quite general phenomenon .
While there ’s been plenty of controversy around that claim , the most careful analysis I have seen roughly supports Hacker ’s contention .
( The CBO , using different data and a different methodology disagrees . )
What Hacker actually shows is that the average level of income volatility is rising .
But we know that an average can hide as much as it reveals .
And this is the point brilliantly developed in a provocative new working paper by my Wharton colleague Shane Jensen , and my former colleague Stephen Shore ( full paper available here ; warning , there are some econometric pyrotechnics involved ) .
Income volatility is not a single number — some people ’s incomes move around over time more than others .
And while Hacker and others have documented a rise in the average level of income volatility , Jensen and Shore document changes in the entire distribution of different people ’s income volatilities .
A stock market analogy might be useful : some stocks are more volatile , some are less , and it is interesting to see what is happening to the volatility of different types of stocks , and not just some mythical “ average stock . ”
The Jensen - Shore findings are pretty stark and are sure to stir the policy debate : Despite sharp growth since the 1970 ’s in the average level of income volatility , median income volatility is basically unchanged .
( There are some differences in samples and methods between the Jensen - Shore and Hacker analyses , but I would be surprised if that explains much . )
Indeed , there ’s been no change in income volatility for most of the distribution :
Here ’s the punch line :
The key driver of rising average levels of income risk is that life among the already risky has become even riskier .
Indeed , you really need to look to the riskiest 5 percent of the distribution to find the rise in income risk .
And this rise in risk among the already risky is so great as to be responsible for nearly all the rise in average income volatility .
And who are these riskiest 5 percent ?
Jensen and Shore find that they are particularly likely to be self - employed .
The Jensen - Shore analysis yields an interesting scorecard : Hacker was right on average , but wrong for 95 percent of us .
And as for that earlier Hacker v. CBO debate , perhaps Jensen and Shore have a useful reconciliation .
The CBO ’s analysis was based on administrative income data , which we typically think of as being better than self - reported income .
But in this case , one might imagine that the income swings of the very riskiest 5 percent did n’t show up on their W - 2’s ( think : entrepreneurs or the self - employed ) , and hence it is possible that the CBO data missed the rising risk among the riskiest .
You might think that the disconnect between Hacker ’s thesis and the actual experiences of most people would have undermined its acceptance .
But Hacker ’s thesis resonated strongly with many policymakers because it somehow “ feels ” accurate .
Here , I suspect that it is too easy to confuse the feeling that the labor market is riskier than we would like with the actual claim that income risk is higher than it was .
Perhaps the debate about the Great Risk Shift is n’t such a big deal after all : the best argument for a social safety net is that there is too much risk , not that risk has grown .
Full details , including technical wizardry , here .
Barack Obama has moved swiftly to put his stamp on the Democratic party , announcing on day two of his status as presidential nominee that the central party will abide by the same rules on accepting money from lobbyists as his own campaign .
The move signalled that Obama intends to impose a new approach to politics , and that he wants to be seen to be doing so .
A central theme running through his bid for the Democratic nomination is that he will sweep aside the chummy relationship between politicians and lobbyists and free himself from the grip of special interests .
Under the new rules , the Democratic National Committee , which raises central funds for the presidential campaign , will take on board Obama 's existing ban on donations from lobbyists who do business with the government as well as from political action committees - private interest groups set up to raise money in order to influence the outcome of elections .
Apart from highlighting Obama 's determination to be a decisive party leader , the imposition of tighter funding rules allows him a clear line of attack against his opponent , John McCain .
The Republican has been beset with troubles over lobbying , despite his reputation as a scourge of special interests having initiated legislation in 2002 to clean up political campaign finance .
McCain 's advisers are prominent lobbyists .
The senator for Arizona was forced to dismiss several after his campaign was criticised for employing two aides from a firm that has worked on behalf of the Burmese regime .
The other in - built benefit of moving quickly on campaign funding is that it will cost Obama very little .
He has already established a phenomenal money - raising machine , largely through small donations achieved through the internet .
The Obama campaign has raised $ 272 m ( £ 136 m ) .
Considering the $ 200 m donated to Hillary Clinton 's fund - and presuming her supporters put their financial clout behind Obama 's presidential hopes - McCain 's available cash is dwarfed .
In the primaries Obama spent more on television ads than Republicans combined .
McCain 's weaker fundraising potential has forced him to accept about $ 84 m in public financing , but with that comes overall spending limits .
As the Politico website pointed out , Obama could outdo that several times over without having to draw on any public money .
If a million of his 1.5 million donors contributed the legal amount of $ 2,300 each , he would have a war chest of $ 2.3 bn - far in excess of anything ever seen in US political history .
With the Democratic nomination settled , the Republicans have been seeking to exploit divisions within the party and peel away Democrats and independents uneasy with Obama .
The Republican national committee 's research arm began releasing memos highlighting criticism of the Illinois senator from fellow Democrats as soon as he clinched the nomination .
They featured primary - campaign comments critical of Obama from former president Jimmy Carter , senators Joe Biden and Chris Dodd , former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack , and Hillary Clinton .
The Republicans hope to capitalise on dissension among the 17.5 million Americans who voted for Clinton and show independent voters that not even the Democrats are united behind Obama .
" The longer the Democrats have [ to take ] to heal these divisions , the longer it gives McCain to organise in the key states , " said David Johnson , a Republican strategist .
" It keeps them from attacking him and trying to tie McCain to Bush .
If his own party has so many questions about him , how can the American people support him ? "
Bruce Buchanan , a political scientist at the University of Texas , said Republican efforts are aimed largely at the blue collar voters Obama failed to win over .
Those voters are mostly moved by economic issues .
On those Clinton was seen as the stronger of the candidates , even though hers and Obama 's policy positions were similar .
Roger Kreutz dashed to right a wrong .
A tiny wrong , by modern standards , but a wrong nonetheless .
“ Dammit , ” Roger might have thought , “ you ca n’t even enjoy a quiet cup of coffee anymore . ”
Then he sprang into action .
Aaron Poisson has a girlfriend and a car .
And he ’s out of high school .
That ’s a liberating combination to a young man .
The boundaries of his youth–walls to many young men aching to break the chains of childhood–are far behind him .
Atlanta ’s no longer big enough for Aaron , so he grabbed his honey and headed West , to Cincinnati and St. Louis .
One hundred thirty years ago , Aaron would have been a pioneer .
Today , he ’s more of a drifter .
Gary Poisson described his son ’s stunt as “ a silly , sophomoric misdemeanor gone horribly , tragically wrong . ”
It was “ poor judgement ” and “ stupidity ” and “ petty theft .
It was wrong . ”
But Aaron , nineteen , and his girlfriend , 21 , are not malicious .
He was in St. Louis to visit St. Louis University and Washington University with the possibility of attending one or the other in the fall .
Gary says his son is a good kid who , since meeting his present girlfriend , has shown a propensity for doing stupid , impulsive things , like reaching into tip jars .
On March 4 , 2008 , Gary ’s son walked into a Starbuck ’s in St. Louis County .
Aaron ’s girlfriend bought a drink .
Aaron waited until she ’d secured the beverage , then reached into the tip jar , extracted five dollars and twenty cents , then fled the store .
Roger was the kind of guy who should have been near Ground Zero on September 11 .
He would have rushed into the burning Towers to save lives and , maybe , smash a few terrorists heads had they somehow survived the impact .
Roger might have been in the First Lady ’s booth at a State of the Union Address for some act of selfless heroics .
If only his selfless act of heroism had involved some larger crime or tragedy .
How Roger learned that Aaron had stolen the contents of the tip jar is unknown .
At least , it ’s not discernible from the security tape that shows Aaron stealing the money .
But Roger knew there was a wrong to be righted , and , since no one else was stepping up , Roger would .
Aaron and his gal were in their car .
Roger was on foot .
Aaron backed up to get out of there .
Roger went down .
The car backed over Roger then took off .
In fewer than 24 hours , Roger died from the injuries sustained in Aaron ’s getaway .
Aaron ’s petty crime became a string of felonies in less than one minute .
Roger ’s compulsion to make things right left him dead .
Gary Poisson understands the long - term consequences of impulsive acts .
One stupid decision can lead remarkably tragic consequences .
An act of childish thievery too small to make the crime section of the Suburban Journal winds up on NBC News because of the lethal coming - together of a teenage boy , a girl , a car , and a hero .
Aaron Poisson faces charges of involuntary manslaughter , leaving the scene of an accident , and misdemeanor larceny .
His girlfriend was not charged , apparently , because she ’s not a man .
Gary Poisson ’s funeral is Monday , March 10 .
Righteous bloggers and talk - show callers want Aaron hanged .
I want God to rewind the tape a week in hopes that , upon further review , someone –anyone –did something just a little bit differently .

An Israeli government minister warned yesterday that increasing rocket fire from Gaza would bring Palestinians a Shoah – the Hebrew word normally used to denote the Nazi Holocaust inflicted on Jews during the Second World War .
The declaration by the Deputy Defence Minister , Matan Vilnai , came amid fresh calls from some Israeli politicians for a ground invasion of Gaza provoked by the launch of eight Soviet - designed Grad rockets into the southern city of Ashkelon during the lethal violence of the past three days .
Mr Vilnai declared : " As the rocket fire grows , and the range increases – and they have n't yet said the last word on this – they are bringing upon themselves a greater Shoah because we will use all our strength in every way we deem appropriate , whether in air strikes or on the ground . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The former Labour minister and general in the IDF military told Army Radio : " We 're getting close to using our full strength . "
Government spokesmen launched an immediate damage limitation exercise saying that Mr Vilnai was merely using the word to mean " disaster " and not in any way intending to convey the idea of genocide .
But Shoah is rarely used in modern Hebrew parlance for events other than the Holocaust .
The Israeli air strikes have killed at least 33 people , including five children , in the past two days .
The strikes were launched in response to the barrage of Qassam rockets launched from Gaza , one of which killed an Israeli mature student in the southern town of Sderot on Wednesday .
The rocket attacks themselves followed the killing of five key Hamas militants in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis earlier that day .
One girl , aged 17 , was injured by the more powerful , longer - range rockets fired at Ashkelon , a city of 120,000 people situated 11 miles north of Gaza .
Another missile went through the roof of an apartment building and landed three floors below .
Palestinian militants have not used them in such quantities before .
Arye Mekel , spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry , reinforcing comments made by Mr Vilnai 's own spokesman , added : " Matan Vilnai used the Hebrew phrase that included the term Shoah in the sense of a disaster or a catastrophe , and not in the sense of a holocaust . "
But Hamas was quick to seize on the minister 's remark .
A spokesman , Sami Abu Zuhri , said : " We are facing new Nazis who want to kill and burn the Palestinian people . "

One man was slightly wounded by a rocket attack on Sderot yesterday – one of 16 which the military said had been fired during the day .
Palestinian sources in Gaza said that five people – including two children – had been wounded in three air strikes in the northern Strip yesterday .
Tony Blair , envoy for the Middle East international Quartet , while " utterly condemning " the rocket attacks from Gaza , said last night : " It is vital that in action against them , everything possible is done to avoid the loss of innocent Palestinian life , so that there are not even more victims of the situation created in Gaza . "
The Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , is thought to be very wary of authorising a major ground offensive in Gaza .
But Tzachi Hanegbi , chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee and a hawkish member of Mr Olmert 's ruling Kadima party , said yesterday : " The State of Israel must make a strategic decision to order the IDF to prepare quickly to topple the Hamas terror regime and take over all the areas from which rockets are fired on Israel . "
He said the IDF should prepare to remain in those areas for years if necessary .
Yossi Beilin , the former minister and ex-leader of the left of centre Meretz Party , said that a diplomatic rather than military solution was needed .
He said that Hamas had at least twice made requests " via a third party " to agree a truce .
He added : " My solution is to reach a ceasefire with Hamas . "
A Haaretz - Dialog poll this week showed that 64 per cent of Israelis were in favour of such an agreement to end the rocket fire , and secure the release of the Israeli corporal , Gilad Shalit , who was abducted by Gaza militants in June 2006 .
On a visit to Ashkelon , however , the Defence Minister , Ehud Barak , gave little sign that the government was contemplating such a course .
" Hamas is directly responsible for the current situation and will be the one to bear the cost of our response .
An Israeli response is necessary and will be carried out , " he said .
Ismail Haniyeh , the de facto Hamas prime minister in Gaza , speaking at a mosque near his home in his first public appearance for a month , said : " What does a large - scale raid mean ?
You [ Israelis ] were in the Gaza Strip and you quit because of the resistance . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards endorsed Sen. Barack Obama on Wednesday at a campaign event in Grand Rapids , Michigan .
" The reason I 'm here tonight is because the Democratic voters have made their choice , and so have I , " he told the boisterous crowd .
" There is one man who knows and understands that this is a time for bold leadership .
There is one man that knows how to create the change , the lasting change , that you have to build from the ground up , " Edwards said .
" There is one man who knows in his heart there is time to create one America , not two ... and that man is Barack Obama . "
Edwards also praised Sen. Hillary Clinton 's candidacy .
" What she has shown ... is strength and character , and what drives her is something that every single one of us can and should appreciate , " Edwards said .
" She is a woman who , in my judgment , is made of steel , and she 's a leader in this country not because of her husband but because of what she has done . "
Watch Edwards give his endorsement »
He said that when the nomination battle is over , " and it will be over soon , brothers and sisters ... we must come together as Democrats . "
Obama later praised Edwards and his wife , Elizabeth , during the rally .

" I am so grateful ... for John Edwards to come to Michigan tonight .
... I 'm grateful for his support ... but more importantly , I want to thank John for everything that he has already done to make us one America , " Obama said .
Watch an analysis of the endorsement »
After the announcement , Republican National Committee Chairman Robert Duncan released a statement asking , " Why did n't Edwards endorse sooner ? "
" Edwards ' endorsement of a candidate he previously blasted as inexperienced , hypocritical and lacking substance will not help Obama with voters looking for real change , " he said .
Edwards dropped out of the Democratic race on January 30 after poor showings in the early contests .
He told NBC last week that Obama , the Democratic front - runner , is the party 's likely nominee .
Both Obama and Clinton had sought Edwards ' blessing .
Watch a report on the timing of the endorsement »
Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe said Wednesday that " We respect John Edwards , but as the voters of West Virginia showed last night , this thing is far from over . "
According to CNN 's latest estimates , Obama has 1,884 total delegates ( pledged : 1,600 , superdelegates : 284 ) .
Clinton has 1,718 total delegates ( pledged : 1,445 , superdelegates : 273 ) .
Edwards , meanwhile , has 19 total pledged delegates who may or may not pledge their support for Obama at the Democratic National Committee 's August convention in Denver , Colorado .
Edwards , who is not a superdelegate , said last week that it was fine for Clinton to continue making her case but expressed concern that a continued campaign could damage the party 's prospects in November .
Wednesday 's endorsement could help Obama reach out to white blue - collar voters , a demographic that Obama has failed to capture , most notably in the recent Pennsylvania and West Virginia primaries .
Edwards had campaigned on the message that he was standing up for the little guy , the people who are not traditionally given a voice in Washington , and that he would do more to fight special interests .
After dropping out of the race , Edwards asked Clinton and Obama to make poverty a central issue in the general election and a future Democratic administration , something both agreed to do .
Watch Edwards discuss Obama and Clinton on " Larry King Live " »
An endorsement from Edwards , who ran as vice president on Sen. John Kerry 's ticket in the 2004 presidential election , would have a significant impact on the race , Democratic strategist Peter Fenn said after Edwards dropped out .
" You could make an argument that the change issue does benefit Barack Obama , that he picks up that support .
You could also make the argument that there 's a lot of support out there amongst people that will go to Hillary , " he said .
Some political pundits predicted Edwards ' supporters are more likely to lean in Obama 's direction .
" The conventional wisdom is that Barack Obama will pick up maybe 60 percent of them , and in some places , that makes a huge difference , " former presidential adviser David Gergen said in January .
Time magazine 's Joe Klein said Clinton " represents a lot of the things that [ Edwards ] campaigned against , you know , the old Washington Democratic establishment that he believes got too close to the corporations in the ' 90s . "
Edwards announced that he was dropping out in New Orleans , Louisiana , the same city where he declared his run for the 2008 Democratic presidential race .
" It is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path , " he said .
With his wife and children at his side , Edwards said he could n't predict " who will take the final steps to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , " but he said it would be a Democrat .
Edwards trailed Clinton and Obama in the early contests .
He came in third in key races in New Hampshire and South Carolina .
Klein said Edwards played a positive role in spurring his competitors during the early part of the campaign .
" On a lot of substantive issues like health insurance , he was the first one out of the box with a very ambitious universal plan , and I think he forced the others to become bolder in a lot of their policy prescriptions , energy dependence and so on , " Klein said .
Edwards is a South Carolina native with an undergraduate degree from North Carolina State University and law degree from the University of North Carolina .
Before entering politics , winning a Senate seat from North Carolina in 1998 , Edwards was a lawyer representing families " being victimized by powerful interests , " according to his campaign Web site .

A reader , who I ’ll call “ Mary , ” emailed me recently wanting to how to go about selling the family business .
I thought the answer might be valuable to you , too .
So I ’m sharing the answer here .
“ Mary ” Writes This Question :
My husband & I own a business that he inherited from his Dad .
His Dad started the operation in the 1960s and since 2002 we have been running it .
My husband is owner / operator and I do all of the AP / AR , phones , typing documents , etc .
Simply put we ’ve had enough & want to sell but neither of us have any idea how to go about it .
We could probably sell for millions but , just as easily , we could be taken to the bank .
Any advice on how to go about starting this process ?
Any advice would be most appreciated .
Thanks !!!
“ Mary ”
The Answer to : How Do I Sell My Business ?
Dear Mary ,
Hire a business broker .
They ’re like real estate brokers , but handle businesses instead of just real estate .
You ’re more likely to get fair value for your business with a good broker representing you .
A broker will help you set an asking price that ’s reasonable without leaving money on the table .
A broker will actively market your business .
The broker will also guide you through the selling process , which can be rather involved , with due diligence , negotiations and closing .
Interview at least 3 brokers so that you make an informed choice .
Do n’t rush your choice .
Look for someone you have confidence in .
Look for someone who :
(1 ) will do a comparable sales analysis and a professional valuation of your business ; and
( 2 ) outlines a solid game plan for marketing your business .
Where to Find a Business Broker
To find a broker , start with your accountant or attorney .
That ’s one of the benefits of having relationships with advisors .
Often they know the business brokers in the local community .
Or you could go over and search at BizBuySell.com .
It ’s a well - known website that partners with the Wall Street Journal .
There ’s a section that lists business brokers .
Be sure to ask for references and check them .
Do n’t Try to Sell on Your Own
Unless you are used to wheeling and dealing , I do not recommend trying to sell your business on your own .
You ’d still have to value the business so as not to leave money on the table — and that ’s hard for a layman to do accurately .
Or you ’d have to pay for a professional valuation anyway .
Selling a business is an involved process .
It ’s best to have an experienced professional on your side to show you the ropes .
On top of that , you ’d still have to do all the marketing — something that ’s hard to do while you ’re running the business day to day .
It takes 9 months on average to sell a business .
You ca n’t afford to neglect the business for such an extended time while you ’re caught up selling it .
If revenues / profits drop , the selling price also suffers .
Fees and Commissions
A word about broker fees :
You ’ll likely pay a commission of around 10 % of the sales price .
( See also Business Toolkit . )
That ’s just a rule of thumb , not a guarantee .
Some brokers charge more .
Some charge less on any real - estate involved .
If you interview at least 3 brokers , you ’ll get a sense for the going rate for fees in your industry and geographical area .
I never begrudge paying a good professional .
Instead I look at the end result .
Am I likely to have more money in my pocket after a sale by using a broker , as opposed to going it alone and possibly making a big mistake ?
Consider this example :
Selling on your own you get $ 600,000 for your business .
But if you had hired a good business broker who gets $ 750,000 for your business , and takes a 10 % commission , you ’d still net $ 675,000 or $ 75 K more than on your own .
How could the broker get such a higher price ?
Because valuing a business is an art , not a science , just like negotiating a good deal is an art .
A broker can help with both .
Good luck to you and your husband .
This is an update to a post I originally made back in February 2008 : Corn Ethanol Economics .
While this is approximate , I think I captured most of the major economic considerations .
In fact , one of the comments I received following the first essay was : " I work in an ethanol plant .
Those numbers are pretty accurate , but the price we get for ethanol has been going up lately .
Our margins have been poor lately , but are improving .
But you did capture the important economic factors that have hurt us lately . "
Since then , natural gas , corn , and ethanol prices have all risen .
So what do the economics look like today ?
The following is my previous analysis , with updated numbers .
I found multiple references for all of the numbers I am going to use , but I will only reference a single source .
According to Ethanol Reshapes the Corn Market , one 56 - pound bushel of corn will yield up to 2.7 gallons of ethanol and 17.4 pounds of distiller ’s dried grains with solubles ( DDGS ) .
The price of corn for July delivery as of this writing is $ 7.24 / bushel , so each gallon of ethanol contains $ 7.24/2.7 , or $ 2.68 of corn per gallon of ethanol .
However , the DDGS can be sold , so a credit is applied for that .
The current price of DDGS as of this writing is $ 175 / ton , which is $ 0.0875 / lb .
Given that a bushel of corn yields 17.4 pounds of DDGS , there is then a $ 1.52 credit , which spread over 2.7 gallons is equal to $ 0.56 gallon .
This reduces our cost per gallon to $ 2.68 minus $ 0.56 , or $ 2.12 for just the corn input .
( Note that there is sometimes a credit for carbon dioxide sales , but it is very small relative to the other costs and credits ) .
I still have to consider utilities ( natural gas is a major cost ) , labor , enzyme and yeast costs , and depreciation .
I have a spreadsheet from an actual ethanol plant , but there is n't much in the public domain that I could find on this .
The closest thing to a source on these is the spreadsheet in the presentation Fossil Fuels and Ethanol Plant Economics ( for a standard dry mill process ) .
If you look at Page 16 of the presentation , you can see that all of the miscellaneous costs together total approximately as much as the corn inputs .
If you take the spreadsheet on Page 24 and change the natural gas price to the current price of $ 13.20 / MMBTU , you get an overall energy cost of $ 0.51 / gal of ethanol .
( You can play around with the original spreadsheet that is in the PDF here ) .
The sum of enzymes , yeast , and other chemicals comes out to be $ 0.14 / gal , and labor , maintenance , and various miscellaneous expenses add another $ 0.23 / gal .
On depreciation , I have several sources for capital costs that are pretty consistent .
In the EIA 's Energy Outlook 2006 , capital costs per daily barrel of corn ethanol ranged from $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 , depending on the size of the plant .
This breaks down to between $ 1.30 and $ 1.95 per gallon of installed capacity .
This is also consistent with A Guide for Evaluating the Requirements of Ethanol Plants , which states " Current capital cost per annual gallon of installed capacity for an ethanol plant ranges from $ 1.25 to $ 2.00 . "
So let 's be conservative and say that we want to build a big plant , so the capital costs are on the low end at $ 1.30 / gallon .
Depreciate that over 15 years and this portion amounts to about $ 0.08 per gallon ( but is captured above already ) .
However , for biomass to liquids facilities - which would include the biomass gasification to ethanol that some are calling cellulosic ethanol - the capital costs in the EIA 's Energy Outlook 2006 are listed at around 5 times that of a conventional corn ethanol plant .
Thus , the capital depreciation portion is going to be around $ 0.40 per gallon of ethanol .
( On the other hand , the feed costs should be much lower ) .
Summary
Times are tough for ethanol producers .
This is what the economics roughly look like at $ 7.24 per bushel of corn and $ 13.20 / MMBTU of natural gas .
To produce 1 gallon of ethanol requires :
$ 2.68 of corn
$ 0.51 of energy
$ 0.14 of enzymes , yeast , etc .
$ 0.23 of labor , maintenance , and various miscellaneous expenses
There is a DDGS credit per gallon of ethanol of $ 0.56 .
Thus , the total cost to produce a gallon of ethanol today is $ 2.68 + $ 0.51 + $ 0.14 + $ 0.23 - $ 0.56 , or exactly $ 3 / gallon of ethanol .
For reference , the July contract for ethanol in the Midwest closed yesterday at $ 2.86 .
And $ 3 / gallon is merely cost of production .
It does n't take into account any return on investment .
Also note that due to the lower energy content , this production cost is equivalent to a $ 4.48 per gallon production cost for gasoline ( $ 3/0.67 ) - and that this production cost is a moving target :
As long as the ethanol mandates are driving up the price of corn and increasing the demand for and cost of natural gas , corn ethanol producers must chase their tails in a vicious circle .
Producers are going to be hard - pressed to ever match the 2006 windfall that was given to them when the MTBE phaseout drove ethanol prices sky - high .
But my conclusion is - since ethanol is mandated - some marginal producers will shut down and prices will rise .
If everything else remained constant , I think ethanol would have to rise to something like $ 3.40 - $ 3.60 / gal to make it worthwhile to ethanol producers .
So , if I was a commmodities investor , I would probably go long ethanol right now .
The Economics of Bananas
The papers yesterday were full of news about bananas .
The Wall Street Journal reported that Chiquita Brands International , “ the Cincinnati - based banana distributor ” ( I love that phrase ; it evokes Lardner , or at least Runyon ) , was expected to report a third - quarter loss due to higher fuel costs and bad weather in banana - growing countries .
Chiquita stock fell sharply on the news .
The second article was far more interesting , and answered a question I ’ve long wondered about : why are bananas so cheap relative to other fruit , especially since a lot of the fruit we consume in the U.S. is grown here while bananas are not ?
Dan Koppel , author of Banana : The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World , wrote an Op - Ed in The Times that is packed with interesting stuff about the Freudian fruit .
The economics are particularly interesting :
That bananas have long been the cheapest fruit at the grocery store is astonishing .
They ’re grown thousands of miles away , they must be transported in cooled containers , and even then they survive no more than two weeks after they ’re cut off the tree .
Apples , in contrast , are typically grown within a few hundred miles of the store and keep for months in a basket out in the garage .
Yet apples traditionally have cost at least twice as much per pound as bananas .
Americans eat as many bananas as apples and oranges combined , which is especially amazing when you consider that not so long ago , bananas were virtually unknown here .
They became a staple only after the men who in the late 19th century founded the United Fruit Company ( today ’s Chiquita ) figured out how to get bananas to American tables quickly — by clearing rainforest in Latin America , building railroads and communication networks , and inventing refrigeration techniques to control ripening .
…
Once bananas had become widely popular , the companies kept costs low by exercising iron - fisted control over the Latin American countries where the fruit was grown .
Workers could not be allowed such basic rights as health care , decent wages , or the right to congregate . …
Over and over , banana companies , aided by the American military , intervened whenever there was a chance that any “ banana republic ” might end its cooperation .
…
Labor is still cheap in these countries , and growers still resort to heavy - handed tactics .
The final piece of the banana pricing equation is genetics .
Unlike apple and orange growers , banana importers sell only a single variety of their fruit , the Cavendish .
There are more than 1,000 varieties of bananas — most of them in Africa and Asia — but except for an occasional exotic , the Cavendish is the only banana we see in our markets . …
By sticking to this single variety , the banana industry ensures that all the bananas in a shipment ripen at the same rate , creating huge economies of scale .
The Cavendish is the fruit equivalent of a fast - food hamburger : efficient to produce , uniform in quality , and universally affordable .
Some readers may recoil at this description and vow to never eat another banana .
Others may thank their lucky stars that free markets are able to deliver a tasty , healthy , peel - intact fruit to their corner stores at very affordable prices .
Koppel ’s larger message is that the Cavendish banana is under fungal threat and may disappear .
And , because Koppel seems to endorse the locavore movement ( unlike some of us ) , he does n’t sound all that sad :
In recent years , American consumers have begun seeing the benefits — to health , to the economy , and to the environment — of buying foods that are grown close to our homes .
…
[ B ] ananas have always been an emblem of a long - distance food chain .
Perhaps it ’s time we recognize bananas for what they are : an exotic fruit that , some day soon , may slip beyond our reach .
I am guessing this prognosis is alarmist but I have no way of knowing .
Can anyone out there add some insight ?
Would you go on a mission to Mars ?
What about if it was a one - way mission ?
And you were by yourself ?
Yeah , that changes things a bit .
Well , that 's exactly what former NASA engineer Jim McClane suggests , saying that it 's worth considering and removes many of the hurdles keeping us from the Red Planet now .
Advertisement
Dubbed " Spirit of the Lone Eagle , " his plan would eliminate the hardest aspect of any potential Mars mission : the need to launch off of Mars to return to Earth .
" When we eliminate the need to launch off Mars , we remove the mission 's most daunting obstacle , " said McLane .
And because of a small crew size , the spacecraft could be smaller and the need for consumables and supplies would be decreased , making the mission cheaper and less complicated .
While some might classify this as a suicide mission , McLane feels the concept is completely logical .
" There would be tremendous risk , yes , " said McLane , " but I do n't think that 's guaranteed any more than you would say climbing a mountain alone is a suicide mission .
People do dangerous things all the time , and this would be something really unique , to go to Mars .
I do n't think there would be any shortage of people willing to volunteer for the mission .
Lindbergh was someone who was willing to risk everything because it was worth it .
I do n't think it will be hard to find another Lindbergh to go to Mars .
That will be the easiest part of this whole program . "

So , what do you say , wannabe space travelers ?
Would you ride in a tiny spaceship to Mars by yourself to be known as the first human ever to travel to , and then die on , Mars ?

Many homes in the Irrawaddy river delta were destroyed by the cyclone
Enlarge Image
The death toll from Burma 's devastating cyclone has now risen to more than 22,000 , state media have said .
Another 41,000 are missing three days after Cyclone Nargis hit the country , causing a huge tidal surge to sweep inland , according to state radio .
The report came as aid agencies begin what they expect to be a major relief operation to help hundreds of thousands left without clean water and shelter .
Burma 's government has been criticised over its handling of the crisis .
A number of Burmese nationals and some foreigners have said they had not been properly warned by the country 's military leaders about the approaching storm .
Some witnesses have also said the government 's response to the disaster has so far been slow and inadequate .
US President George W Bush has urged the military leadership to give access to American disaster assessment teams , saying his country was ready to use its navy " to help find the missing , to help stabilise the situation " .

Advertisement Mr Bush was speaking as he signed legislation awarding the top US civilian honour , the Congressional Gold Medal , to the detained Burmese pro-democracy leader and Nobel laureate , Aung San Suu Kyi .
The US later said it had offered $ 3 m of aid , up from an initial contribution of $ 250,000 .
The UK said it had promised £ 5 m ( $ 9.9 m ) , the EU offered 2 m euros ( $ 3.1 m ) , while China said it had given $ 1 m .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said his country had limited its financial contribution to 200,000 euros ( $ 310,000 ) : " It 's not a lot , but we do n't really trust the way the Burmese ministry would use the money , " he said .
Horrific scenes State media reported on Tuesday that 22,464 people had now been confirmed dead and another 41,054 people missing as a result of the cyclone .
As rescue teams get to areas presently cut off , those figures are expected to rise .

Almost all of the deaths occurred in the Irrawaddy river delta region , where more people were killed by the tidal wave than the cyclone itself , Minister for Relief and Resettlement Maung Maung Swe told reporters in Rangoon .
" The wave was up to 12ft [ 3.5 m ] high and it swept away and inundated half the houses in low - lying villages , " he said .
" They did not have anywhere to flee . "
Some 95 % of the homes in the city of Bogalay in the Irrawaddy delta were destroyed and most of its 190,000 residents are now homeless , he added .
The neighbouring cities of Labutta and Pyapon have also been badly affected .
A doctor in Labutta told the BBC that half of the city had vanished and dozens of surrounding villages washed away .
Satellite images released by the US space agency , Nasa , showed virtually the entire coastal plain of the country under water , destroyed roads , downed power lines and flattened houses .
One of the few aid agencies permitted to work inside Burma , World Vision , described scenes of horror in the affected areas , with fields strewn with bodies and desperate survivors without food or shelter .
HAVE YOUR SAY International assistance must take place Kevin , New York " They saw the dead bodies from the helicopters , so it 's quite overwhelming , " said Kyi Minn , an adviser to World Vision 's office .
Foreign journalists are being denied entry to Burma , but a BBC reporter who has made it to Rangoon , its largest city and former capital , says he saw evidence of massive destruction , with houses torn down and trees ripped from their roots .
Parts of the city have had power and water restored , but most people are still running short , he adds .
Aid appeal International aid agencies and the United Nations have begun a major relief operation to help the hundreds of thousands of survivors left homeless by the cyclone .
The UN World Food Programme said its food aid had begun to reach people in and around Rangoon .
Additional truckloads of food are due to be dispatched on Wednesday to Labutta , which it said was the area hardest hit .
It said many of the coastal areas in the Irrawaddy delta remained cut off due to extensive flooding and road damage .
Many countries have promised humanitarian assistance to Burma

The aid challenge Crucial test for junta
The WFP said it had more than 800 tonnes of food available in its warehouses in Rangoon and would airlift more supplies into Burma as soon as possible .
WFP country director Chris Kaye said the government had provided " some valuable co-operation " , but said " much more " would be needed .
Thailand has already flown in some aid , India is sending two naval ships , and Bangladesh has said it will fly food and water purification tablets to Rangoon on Wednesday .
Many other countries have promised further assistance .
Rashid Khalikov from the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) warned that some UN aid work was being delayed by visa restrictions .
He said the UN was urging Burma to waive the requirement for UN staff to have entry visas as the governments of Iran and Pakistan did after similar natural disasters .
Referendum delay Correspondents say Burma , isolated and impoverished , has long been wary of the international community and there are doubts over how much access the government will allow aid workers .

In pictures : Cyclone aftermath Major cyclones timeline Burma 's leaders have said they will accept external help , in a move that correspondents say could reflect the scale of the disaster .
" The task is very wide and extensive and the government needs the co-operation of the people and well - wishers from at home and abroad , " Information Minister Kyaw Hsan was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying on Tuesday .
" We will not hide anything .
Please ask the people not to be duped by rumours or fabrication , " he said , adding that $ 4.5 m of disaster aid had been set aside .
Burmese state television reported on Tuesday the government had decided to postpone to 24 May the referendum on a new constitution in areas worst - hit by the cyclone - including Rangoon and Irrawaddy .
But it said that the vote initially planned for 10 May would proceed as planned in the rest of the country .
The opposition National League for Democracy ( NLD ) criticised the decision to press ahead .

What are these ?
Kathleen Abdalla , of the UN ’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs ( DESA ) , told a news conference in New York that while populations have grown and diets have changed , “ we ’ve had a lack of investment in agriculture for quite a long time now and a lack of aid for agriculture .
Certainly it ’s not been a high priority for development assistance and basically the productivity growth has n’t kept pace with the increase in demand . ”
Ms. Abdalla , Officer - in - Charge of the Division for Sustainable Development , was speaking on the second day of the current session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development ( CSD ) which is tackling topics that are key to boosting the world ’s food supply while addressing problems pertaining to poverty , hunger and the environment .
These include agriculture , land use , rural development , desertification and drought .
Her colleague , Aslam Chaudhry , who is chief of the water and natural resources branch of DESA , said that crops used for biofuel production had also contributed to the current worldwide rise in food prices , since “ they depend quite heavily on land and water resources – so we are using our precious natural resources for the production of these crops . ”
“ At the same time , poor people in developing countries do not have food and had those natural resources been managed for the production of cereal crops , we might not have seen this crisis , ” he added .
Ms. Abdalla said that the aim of the CSD was to look at the linkages between rural development , desertification and drought and to tackle the global food crisis in a “ very holistic way . ”
The CSD ’s session is taking place in New York and is scheduled to last two weeks .
Last week Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon announced a new global Task Force which will prepare a plan of action to tackle rising food prices .
The group , which brings together the heads of key UN agencies , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , as well as experts from the around the globe , will hold its first meeting in New York next Monday .
FOR the last seven years , I ’ve lived in an old stone presbytery in France , south of the Loire Valley , in a village of fewer than 10 houses .
I chose the place because next to the 15th - century house itself was a barn , partly torn down centuries ago , large enough to accommodate my library of some 30,000 books , assembled over six itinerant decades .
I knew that once the books found their place , I would find mine .
My library is not a single beast but a composite of many others , a fantastic animal made up of the several libraries built and then abandoned , over and over again , throughout my life .
I ca n’t remember a time in which I did n’t have a library of some sort .
The present one is a sort of multilayered autobiography , each book holding the moment in which I opened it for the first time .
The scribbles on the margins , the occasional date on the flyleaf , the faded bus ticket marking a page for a reason today mysterious , all try to remind me of who I was then .
For the most part , they fail .
My memory is less interested in me than in my books , and I find it easier to remember the story read once than the young man who then read it .
One of my earliest memories 
I must have been 2 or 3 at the time  is of a shelf full of books on the wall above my cot , from which my nurse would choose a bedtime story .
This was my first library ; when I learned to read by myself a year or so later , the shelf , transferred to safe ground level , became my private domain .
I remember arranging and rearranging my books according to secret rules that I invented for myself : all the Golden Books series had to be grouped together , the fat collections of fairy tales were not allowed to touch the minuscule Beatrix Potters , stuffed animals were not permitted to sit on the same shelf as the books .
I told myself that if these rules were upset , terrible things would happen .
Superstition and the art of libraries are tightly entwined .
That first library was in a house in Tel Aviv , where my father was the Argentine ambassador ; my next one grew in Buenos Aires , during the decade of my adolescence .
Before returning to Argentina , my father had asked his secretary to buy enough books to fill the shelves of his library in our new house ; obligingly , she ordered cartloads of volumes from a secondhand dealer , but found that when she tried to place them on the shelves , many would n’t fit .
Undaunted , she had them trimmed to size and then bound in deep - green leather , a color that , combined with the dark oak , lent the place the atmosphere of a soft forest .
I pilfered books from that library to stock my own , which by then covered three of the walls in my bedroom .
Reading these circumcised books required the extra effort of supplanting the missing bit of every page , an exercise that no doubt trained me well for reading the cut - up novels of William Burroughs years later .
What outlet can the Ron Paul diehards find for their zealous political devotion ?
The presidential candidate with a cult following has long since been defeated in the nomination battle to John McCain , however his base of supporters remains defiant in throwing in the towel .
As this L.A. Times blog describes , Ron Paul supporters " hope to demonstrate their disagreements with McCain vocally at the convention through platform fights and an attempt to get Paul a prominent speaking slot " .
Since the nomination itself is no longer attainable , their new stated goal is to " take control of local committees , boost their delegate totals and influence platform debates " .
I continue to maintain that , even with the prolonged Hillary - Obama nomination battle , the self - destruction of the Guiliani campaign , and about a dozen other novel and fascinating political developments in the past few months , the most significant story that historians will examine from this year 's presidential campaign is that of the astonishing Ron Paul candidacy .
By almost every internet metric , Paul has crushed every other candidate from both parties , has mobilized a grassroots base of online supporters in unprecedented fashion , and , as a result , has broken numerous fundraising records .
He also never came remotely close to winning anything .
It 's extremely positive to see Ron Paul 's supporters continue to engage so whole - heartedly in the political process even after their candidate 's defeat .
Despite my being flamed in this blog space for questioning Paul 's chances of electoral success , and despite the way in which Paul 's followers are often perceived as delusional , it is nevertheless great to see that these people 's devotion and level of civic engagement will not flame out too easily .
Who knows , by adopting their more pragmatic strategy of influencing the party platform and enhancing their control over local committees , the " Ron Paul Revolution " may indeed leave a legacy that stretches far beyond this year 's presidential campaign .
And perhaps far beyond Ron Paul himself .
In the third part of our series on Gaza , Rory McCarthy talks to Ahmad Abu Me'tiq , who lost his wife and four of his children in an Israeli air strike
Her bed is on the third floor of Gaza 's Shifa hospital , where shafts of warm afternoon sunshine reach in from the window .
The ward is crowded , and the bed on which Asma'a Abu Me'tiq lay is curtained off from the rest and surrounded by the blankets her sister - in - law uses when she sleeps on the floor next to her at night .
It may be the best hospital in Gaza but even the poorest families , like the Abu Me'tiqs , must provide extra food themselves .
Asma'a 's father , Ahmad , returns from downstairs with a cheap electric hot - plate , which he bought on credit from a shopkeeper he knows .
He plugs it into the wall to heat a pot of thin homemade soup for his 13 - year - old daughter , but there is either no electricity or the hot - plate did n't work .
" What bad luck , " he says quietly to himself .
Then he reaches over to his daughter , who is coughing and struggling to breathe from the deep wound in her chest .
She has n't touched her food since she was rushed to hospital 10 days earlier : the day an explosion in the street outside demolished the metal front door of their house as the family were eating breakfast , impaling her and her younger sister , Shaima , seven , with shrapnel and killing outright four other brothers and sisters and her mother too .
" I'm waiting to see you eat , " says her father .
" Later , " says Asma'a .
Several minutes passed .
" Let me see you eat , " he says again .
" Tomorrow , " she replies .
As is frequently the case in this most gruelling of conflicts the cause of the explosion that killed the wife and four children of Ahmad Abu Me'tiq is disputed .
Early in the morning of April 28 there was fighting in Beit Hanoun after Israeli troops and armoured vehicles raided the east of the Gaza Strip .
In an air strike the Israeli military fired two missiles into the street outside the Abu Me'tiq 's house , which they said were aimed at four armed men who they said were " carrying backpacks loaded with ammunition and various weaponry . "
The Israeli military insists it was a secondary explosion caused by the " weaponry " that killed five members of the Abu Me'tiq family .
" The professional opinion of the IDF [ Israel Defence Force ] states that the family was hit during the explosion of the second missile that ignited the secondary explosions or from objects that had flown towards them from the strength of the explosion , " it said .
" The IDF wishes to express sorrow for any harm to unassociated civilians caused due to terrorist organisations [ which ] operate from populated centres , using them as human shields . "
However , the family holds the Israeli military responsible for the killings , as does Israel 's leading human rights group , B'Tselem , which said Israel bears an obligation to distinguish between civilians and those taking part in the fighting .
" Whoever fired the original missile bears responsibility for the explosion that led to the deaths of the family members , " it said .
" The missile was fired at a militant who was on the doorstep of a densely populated residential compound , knowing he was carrying ammunition . "
Abu Me'tiq , 70 , said he had received no direct apology from the Israeli military and no offer of compensation for the loss of his wife Meyasar , 40 , and his children Rudeina , six ; Salah , four ; Hana , three ; and year - old Mes'id .
Their deaths add to the growing and striking toll of children killed in the conflict in Gaza .
This year alone at least 44 Palestinian children have been killed , according to a count at the end of April by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights .
The UN has put the figure at 53 children dead and 177 children injured so far this year .
Despite talks about a ceasefire the death toll on both sides continues to rise .
At least 312 Palestinians , more than half civilians , have been killed this year , according to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights .
On the Israeli side six soldiers and six civilians have died , the latest Shuli Katz , 70 , who was killed on Monday by a rocket fired by Gazan militants into Yesha , a village in southern Israel .
The Abu Me'tiqs live in a simple , single - storey concrete house with only mats and cushions for furniture and a broken radio in the front room .
There was no glass on the windows and there were large holes in the corrugated iron and asbestos roof .
Several political parties had come to the house promising money and support , and two Hamas posters and a flag flew outside .
However Abu Me'tiq said he had received no money , and there seemed no evidence of any financial support for the family .
" Just those damn posters , " he said .
He could not remember who he voted for in elections two years ago , though he thought it was one of the smaller leftist factions , which now carries little sway in Palestinian politics .
Abu Me'tiq is from a family of Bedouin and was born in a village near Ashdod , in what is now Israel .
He fled as a boy with his parents during the 1948 war and lived the simple life of a farmer , never learning to read or write .
Now with the Bedouin traditions all but gone in Gaza he has no land and no livestock and relies on UN food handouts and support from his older children , two of whom are married and in their forties .
" We are almost dead .
We have no money , nothing .
We are exhausted , " he said .
Abu Me'tiq was was out collecting medicine from a nearby pharmacy at the time of the missile strike .
When he rushed home the ambulances were still retrieving the bodies of his children and he collapsed on the ground in front of them .
Since then he has been pressing the Palestinian doctors to send his daughter for treatment in Israel , but they have so far refused saying they can do the necessary surgery in Gaza .
" Israel must treat her because they did this thing to us .
She 's what 's left of our family , " he said .
His second injured daughter , Shaima , is less seriously hurt , with her right leg in plaster and should recover well , the doctors say .
The six other children are staying with one of the older sons , Ibrahim , 42 .
" The children can't sleep here at night .
Even I can't bear it , " said Abu Me'tiq .
" This house is empty .
There is nothing for us here . "
The civilian and uniformed heads of the US Air Force have been fired , according to reports .
The two men's reluctance to unleash armadas of drone aircraft into the skies of Afghanistan and Iraq was apparently a major factor in the decision .
However , there was also some unpleasantness regarding mislaid nuclear weapons , and ballistic - missile parts mistakenly shipped to Taiwan .
Defence Secretary Robert Gates announced that General " Buzz " Moseley and Secretary Michael Wynne would resign yesterday .
" Mike Wynne is a dedicated and honorable public servant , and Buzz Moseley has given decades of courageous and devoted service , " said Gates .
" I deeply regret that the issues before us require the actions that I have taken .
I have the highest respect for both men , but I felt the change was needed . "
The decision by Gates followed the publication of a damning review into recent Air Force blunders involving nuclear weapons .
In one well - known case , six cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads were mistakenly loaded onto a B - 52 bomber and flown across the USA without the crew being aware of their deadly cargo .
Then it was discovered that the Taiwanese forces , having requested some spare helicopter batteries , had instead been sent replacement nose - cone assemblies for Minuteman ballistic missiles .
Gates sought to suggest that the nuclear - bomb mishaps had prompted the Air Force purge .
However , he was known to have been engaged in a long - running bureaucratic battle with the service 's upper echelons .
Specific incidents had included a senior airforce general publicly contradicting Gates on how many F - 22 Raptor superfighters would be purchased ( with the general specifying a much larger number ) .
The Defence Secretary had also said that the air force suffered from " next war itis " , in which it was mainly interested in buying and manning equipment which would only be useful in some future battle against Russia or China .
He felt it would be more appropriate to focus on the wars going on right now .
In particular , Gates apparently had to overcome stiff Air Force resistance to an increase in the number of Predator and Reaper robot aircraft operating over Iraq and Afghanistan .
The unmanned planes are in constant demand by hard - pressed ground troops , but are unpopular among the flyboys .
This is the more so as ramping up the remotely - operated planes ' use means drafting pilots away from sexy fighters .
Gates described the process of getting more pilots into the ground stations and more Predators into the air as " like pulling teeth " .
" I think the honorable thing to do is to step aside , " said General Moseley in a statement .
" I love the Air Force and remain proud of America 's Airmen . "
" It has been an honor and pleasure to serve ... side - by - side with General Moseley and the magnificent patriots serving in the Department of Defense and the United States government , " added ex-secretary Wynne . ®
The TV host " did n't mean any malice , " he says in a statement to PEOPLE after criticism from gay activists
Jay Leno apologized Tuesday for on - air remarks he made during a chat with Ryan Phillippe that were then criticized by gay activists and others .
“ In talking about Ryan ’s first role , I realize that what I said came out wrong , ” the host of NBC ’s Tonight Show said in a statement to PEOPLE .
“ I certainly did n’t mean any malice .
I agree it was a dumb thing to say , and I apologize . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Last week , while talking with Phillippe ( whose appearance was keyed to his new movie Stop - Loss ) , Leno , 57 , said to the actor , “ Can you give me , like – say that camera is your gay lover … ” ( Phillippe ’s first role was as a gay character on a soap opera ) .
Leno then went on to say , “ Can you give me your ‘ gayest look ? ’ ”
“ Wow , ” replied Phillippe , 33 .
“ That is so something I do n’t want to do . ”
On Tuesday , the gay rights group GLAAD condemned the remarks .
“ We are proud of Ryan for refusing to participate in Leno ’s thoughtless attempt at humor , ” said GLAAD President Neil G. Giuliano .
“ Under the guise of comedy , the talk - show host is demonstrating a lack of respect for the gay community and insensitivity to both his co-workers and the audience , to whom he owes an apology . ”
Why is this ?
I blame Michael Eugene Porter .
Not that Porter is a dipstick , ( well not only that ) but because the majority of his modern adherents certainly are .
Because these companies hate consumers , hate their desires , hate their needs and , consequently , make sure that the conventional definition of , e.g. , " laptop , " or " phone " is very limited .
I admit , grudgingly , to owing an iPhone .
I bought it in time ( that is to say foolish - early enough ) to have Mr. Jobs give me one of those $ 100 " Sorry I screwed you on the price " rebates .
I also have to admit to owning a top of the line 15 " MacBook Pro ( I bought after the latest upgrades - watching a colleague run Excel on a Windows XP instance isolated from the rest of his system and displayed in a window on his OS X desktop was the last straw ) .
Before that , I had two white , Intel MacBooks .
This is unusual , because three and a half years ago , I never would have bought Apple .
This last , that new Apple owners almost find themselves surprised to own an Apple , seems a common trait among the , admittedly small , sample of Apple owners I have encountered .
I 've watched four or five people who swore they would never own an iPhone give in , buy them and proclaim , in such similar tones one wonders if The Amazing Alexander works for Apple now ( " I loved it .
It 's much better than PC .
I am going to buy it again , and again and again ... " ) , that it is the best phone they have ever owned .
And this is where I began to wonder , why the near epiphany in reaction ?
Now I think I know .
All of this is a round about way of saying that I have finally grown to understand one of my guilty pleasures : Apple .
In doing so , I have managed to focus some attention on some structural issues that have been , at least subconsciously , bothering me for some time .
I make it a practice not to spend a lot of time in these pages on my personal interests and pursuits .
More than occasionally , something related to the general brief covered by Going Private will overlap with my overly broad spectrum of interests , but I do n't spend a lot of time on such things in the abstract .
Be this as it may , occasionally , I can't help myself .
The eager and almost rabid application of Porter 's " Five Forces " ( Supplier Power , Customer Power , Threat of New Entrants , Threat of Substitute Products , Industry Rivalry ) to technology products and services has bred an entire generation of MBAs in marketing positions dedicated to developing and maintaining closed systems and closed hardware platforms .
This is particularly egregious in the case of business models that are effectively based on distribution channels .
In conventional analysis there is nothing wrong with making your living on distribution channels .
Remember , that in 1979 , when Porter developed the Five Forces framework , distribution channels were highly expensive to create and maintain and , owing to these costs , constructing them effectively presented a significant barrier to entry .
Your product did n't even have to be particularly good , because the threat of substitutes was reduced via the difficulty and expense of the competition actually getting those substitutes ( however good they might be ) to your customers .
Suppliers , if they wanted access to your customer base as a proxy to sell their raw materials , had to go through you .
New entrants had to build an entirely new distribution channel .
Customers were stuck .
You owned the market .
But you had to guard this distribution channel carefully .
And you had to make sure you had n't forgotten something simple and critical .
That 's not part of a conventional Porter analysis .
But why would it be ?
Conventional distribution channels are quite physical , antique and boring .
If you want an example of how dependent firms have become on distribution channel dominance as a strategy ( and how lethal this reliance can be ) consider the example of Blockbuster .
All Blockbuster does today is provide , at great expense , an elaborate distribution channel to deliver very cheap plastic discs with expensive data on them to every neighborhood in every major city and town in the country .
As soon as DVDs became the predominant data format , Blockbuster became nothing more than a highly expensive , slow , ultra - high latency internet with a data warehouse limited by inventory practicalities .
Of course , DVDs did eliminate the hated " rewind charge , " but that 's another story .
All Blockbuster is really doing is delivering digital data .
Poorly .
But this is n't a story about how Blockbuster is going to be destroyed by delivering video data over the internet .
It is much simpler than that , and it is simpler because Blockbuster does n't actually add much value .
In fact , beyond their delivery channel they provide no real value at all .
Oh , sure , you can get microwave popcorn , Raisinets and Ju-Ju Bees at the counter after the third fight with your significant other in as many minutes about which chick flick not to get because last time you watched The Break Up and the first 5 episodes of Season 2 of Sex in the City without complaining even once ( she wo n't be impressed no matter how quiet you were , trust me ) , but that 's about it .
The thing is , on the strength of a Porter analysis , Blockbuster was a complete no -brainer in 1996 .
Hollywood Video , the only competition , was a distant second which primarily distinguished itself from Blockbuster by carrying adult videos in contrast to Blockbuster 's " family experience " focus ( I will leave it to you to decide which was more likely to pay dividends in the long term ) .
The Blockbuster brand was a huge barrier to entry , and the fragmented mom and pop video stores were getting consumed rapidly .
Supplier power was low because if you wanted that post - release revenue ( which , increasingly , is a huge part of movie production ) you had to deal with Blockbuster .
Building something like Blockbuster 's store network was next to impossible to do from scratch .
If you were a firm looking to enter the market for video rental in the late 1990s , and you had an MBA with any authority on your management team , you would have picked another business instead because he would have performed a Porter analysis and told you to just forget about it .
Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings did n't , I suspect , have such an MBA on their team , or they saw how worthless he was , and instead thought about the problem hard enough to realize that , while they could n't build an expensive distribution network , they did n't have to .
The United States already had in the form of the United States Postal Service .
In addition , Blockbuster never had to be customer centric .
They never had to develop much of a product , or pricing strategy owing to their distribution dominance .
Randolph and Hastings ' creation , Netflix , could easily beat Blockbuster for customer satisfaction ( this was a low bar ) , and they could do so cheaper ( Blockbuster spends $ 1.5 billion annually on its stores .
Netflix spends around $ 300 million on postage ) .
They also quickly realized what the eventual pricing fate of distribution based business models would be and applied it almost immediately : commodity pricing .
In distribution networks , this means flat - fee revenue models .
Period .
The result ?
Blockbuster 's revenue and Gross profits are basically the same today same as they were in 2002 .
You find a lot of these twisted business models in distribution - only businesses .
Hollywood video was eventually bought by Movie Gallery , which , I suspect as a result of some student of distribution power analysis , also decided to put tanning beds in some locations .
This is backwards in more than one way .
Aside from the obvious ( where is the overlap in these services ? ) the most likely tanning consumers ( women ) are the least likely to have a lot of free time at the video store .
( I recently read a study that indicates that women spend 400 % more time browsing in video stores than men do ) .
Even the most obtuse analysis tells us this is a dumb idea .
Perhaps one of the dumber ideas ... ever .
This , dear friends , is the logic of distribution analysis .
Blockbuster explicitly banned their franchisees from following suit , and the amazing part of that fact is that franchisees actually wanted to .
Movie Gallery emerged from Chapter 11 recently , crippled by the debt assumed from buying Hollywood video .
The Deal summarizes :
With profits in the DVD rental sector harder to come by over the last couple of years , Movie Gallery boldly went ahead and purchased Hollywood Entertainment in 2005 for $ 1.2 billion , which included the assumption of $ 350 million in debt .
The acquisition catapulted Movie Gallery to the No. 2 slot among movie rental companies in the U.S. , behind Blockbuster Inc .
But stiff competition for the entertainment dollar from rivals and cable proved too much for Movie Gallery .
This desperate , last minute clawing to realize revenue out of expensive and , increasingly , less profitable retail distribution networks should set off loud alarm bells in typically astute Going Private readers whenever it appears .
This is , of course , distinguished from the strong overlapping synergies of a strong distribution leveraging strategy .
FedEx - Kinkos is an example of the later , Blockbuster - Circuit City , the former .
Run the way - forward machine ( sounds like a Tory convention platform , no ? ) ahead 30 years and distribution channels for products like software and the like are infinitely cheaper .
Suddenly , one has to find other ways to reduce customer power , the threat of substitutes and the threat of new entrants .
Like create a real product that consumers actually like .
Imagine that .
Coming full circle , we arrive at the business model for every telecom company on the planet .
The amazing part to me is that , almost De Beers like , wireless providers have managed to somehow maintain the fiction that they maintain massive proprietary networks , and price data transmission accordingly .
$ 0.10 per SMS at 160 characters per message works out to around $ 1,000 per megabyte .
This is easily 100 x the revenue extracted from shipping TCP / IP data over " cellular networks , " with the most expensive providers , and yet , functionally , SMS is vastly inferior to TCP / IP instant messaging services on almost all counts .
SMS is limited by message size , media type , and it is high - latency .
This triumph of premium pricing over a total mismatch in supply - demand dynamics for the functionality makes SMS one of the great marketing accomplishments of the century ( hence my De Beers reference ) .
Of course , the distinction between " great marketing accomplishment " and " consumer fraud " can be quite thin , but , then , this is the essence of Porter and shades of interpretation at the FTC .
The hallmark of ( over ) extended Porter analysis in distribution - centric business models is this kind of restrictive , closed structure , and , as the distribution network 's dominance is increasingly threatened , the advent of " use restrictions . "
These two approaches , technical restrictions and contractual use restrictions , represent the two last - ditch steps before total commodity pricing of distribution takes hold .
A classic example of this progression can be seen in the ongoing attempts of internet service providers to maintain price differentiation between business and residential users .
This first took the form of " aDSL / sDSL " ( asynchronous v. synchronous digital subscriber line ) which originally had its origin in the longer loop length aDSL ( and therefore the larger consumer base ) the technology could provide .
That advantage has long since reversed and aDSL now is effectively an artificial technical restriction , keeping upstream bandwidth speeds low and allowing internet service providers to charge business users more for sDSL , which is , in effect , the cheaper , better technology .
To some extent this differential has been eroded , forcing providers to provide the same technology solutions and employ " use restrictions " based on " terms of service " agreements .
Comcast , historically , is a severe offender here , and their approach characterizes the efforts of large internet service providers .
In a few words : Box in the customer .
Consider their service agreement text :
You agree that the Services and the Comcast Equipment will be used only by you and the members of your immediate household living with you at the same address and only for personal , residential , non-commercial purposes , unless otherwise specifically authorized by us in writing .
The " non-commercial purposes " requirement would , at first blush , be violated by anyone with a home office .
As is typical , Comcast adds more restrictions in their " acceptable use " agreement :
[ You may not ] use or run dedicated , stand - alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network ( " Premises LAN " ) , also commonly referred to as public services or servers .
Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include , but are not limited to , e-mail , Web hosting , file sharing , and proxy services and servers ; [...]
Therefore , Comcast reserves the right to suspend or terminate Service accounts where bandwidth consumption is not characteristic of a typical residential user of the Service as determined by the company in its sole discretion .
Read : " You can have all the bandwidth you paid for , until we say you can 't . "
I doubt anyone really believes that a single resident customer with 3.0 or 6.0 Megabits of bandwidth is going to swamp Comcast 's network .
Nor , frankly , are all the customers maxing their bandwidth 24/ 7 .
Bandwidth is cheap .
VERY cheap .
This is an artificial technical restriction .
But , Comcast also does much more .
They do a lot of " bandwidth shaping , " that is , evaluating your traffic and if it looks as if it is , for instance , related to BitTorrent ( legitimate use or otherwise ) choking it down to the point where the service is unusable .
Again , no one contends that BitTorrent use is going to swamp Comcast and degrade their network ( if so , stop selling 6.0 megabit packages to residential customers - oh , you can't because the market would kill you ?
Gee , that sucks ) , nor does it seem likely , given the extensive indemnification clauses and the current state of communications jurisprudence , that Comcast is likely to be hit with liability for clients that , for instance , break copyright laws on Comcast networks .
( In fact , by exercising bandwidth shaping , they start to appear to be examining customer traffic and exercising editorial control , which means that they are inching closer to liability for customer activities ) .
That would make sense if these restrictions were about any of that .
But , of course , they are n't .
They are , instead , the culmination of the struggle to stave off commodity pricing of a distribution network via extended Porter analysis .
And this is another clue to the astute Going Private reader :
The explanations for the technical and use restrictions do n't stand up to even moderate scrutiny .
Like any distribution - centric business , as wireless provider , you can restrict use in the same two ways .
First , close your hardware platform , forbid extensive third party software development and lock users into your applications , and therefore , your built - in use restrictions ( cast as technical restrictions ) .
Of course , there is a balance here , playing the importance to consumers of hardware design innovation in cellphones against the resistance of the telecoms to opening use any further than they dare .
If you license third party hardware , you do so in the context of very strict limitations on agreements , up to and including final form factor design approval , feature approval , application approval or outright development restrictions that forbid the hardware designers from writing code not approved by the network provider .
This was Nokia 's model for years .
Sprint was even worse .
Second , you impose contractual use restrictions .
Verizon experimented with these for a time when they started offering " unlimited data , " but then using using " bandwidth consumption " clauses to terminate customers without warning for , e.g. , downloading video .
( The New York Attorney General sued , Verizon settled , and has since started the much more open " any app , any device " as a business model - I suspect the iPhone had some impact here ) .
The problem is that , in the end , you are just shipping bits .
It is just distribution .
And it is , in effect , very cheap .
Apple , I believe , has evaluated these markets , and , being a highly consumer - focused organization , endeavored to break the cycle and give consumers what they really want .
The success of the iPod and iTunes is based more on breaking arbitrary restrictions on consumers than anything else .
Jobs has almost done for music what Netflix did for video rental .
The process is simple .
Admit that commodity pricing is on the horizon and , rather than cling to old models , simply implement it .
We are n't quite at the point where iTunes is a flat - fee per month for unlimited downloads , but a fixed per-song price is an amazing advance considering the artificial technical restrictions the music industry has imposed .
And at least here we are paying for content , not for distribution .
I do n't have a good dollar figure on the negative revenue effect to the industry implicit in finally permitting a consumer to buy a single song for $ 0.99 instead of $ 14.99 for the entire album , but I suspect it to be somewhat significant .
Digital Rights Management , Trusted Computing Platforms and the like are artificial technical restrictions designed to prevent the commodity pricing model in music .
Suing your customers pursuant to use agreements is not much better .
We 'll see how those work .
I have my guesses .
Enter the iPhone .
Apple aligned with AT&T , I suspect , because they provided the cheapest network solution Apple could negotiate quickly .
They certainly did not have the best network ( EDGE is no 3G ) , or the best coverage , but I personally doubt Apple intended to stick with AT&T for long , and it was a good " proof of concept " deal to see how the iPhone sold before committing to a more committed strategy .
Apple , unlike most firms , actually gets Porter , understands it as a guide to offensive as opposed to defensive market strategy , i.e. , build a base in hardware , users loyalty , and then use that to push around network providers .
And that is just one aspect of supplier power that Apple understands to the core .
This is the same strategy that has made iTunes a powerhouse and able to mostly dictate pricing terms to the big labels .
AT&T was used to dictating terms to hardware providers , including design criteria .
( Nokia and AT&T had any number of bitter battles , none of which Nokia won ) .
Some of the terms reportedly included :
No uncertified third party applications , locked access to AT&T networks only , no user - modifiable hardware or firmware , and reasonable efforts by Apple not to permit modification of the iPhone by users .
Clever Going Private readers will immediately recognize AT&T 's justification " we need to protect our network " as an absurd rationalization for these restrictions and therefore pattern behavior in the genre of distribution protectionism .
Personally , and as a matter of opinion , I find it hard to imagine that Apple has done much beyond the minimum required by contract to prevent third party modification and development .
Further , and again , just one girl 's opinion , I believe this quite intentional .
Several examples leap to mind :
1 . The iPhone is not particularly secure from end users as a platform ( if you caught the irony in the the use of the phrase " secure from end users " in the context of a consumer product , you are likely a regular reader ) .
At least in the most recent versions , all applications run on the operating system as " root . "
2 . Though the iPhone 's root password is changed with each firmware update , it consistently violates every precept of strong password generation in existence ( simple six letter , all lowercase words that I will not reproduce here ) .
While the root password is not the end - all be-all of iPhone security , it certainly reflects a particular security complacency from a firm that absolutely knows better .
Why is that ?
3 . It would be trivial for Apple to identify " jailbroken " iPhones and " brick " them .
Apple has made it easy for sophisticated users to mask their naughty behavior and still get updates to iPhone firmware .
4 . While the iPhone ships locked to AT&T 's network , it is trivial to unlock the device .
As a side note , to the extent Going Private readers place any credence at all in equity analyst reports , it might be a useful exercise to go back and find those analysts that expressed dismay and confusion that the number of AT&T activations of iPhones lagged Apple 's reported sales of the devices by 1.5 million or so .
Any number of explanations ( hoarding by AT&T , fraudulent inflation of sales figures by Apple ) offered by the best and the brightest equity analysis had to offer could have been immediately disabused with a 60 minute commitment to standing in front of an Apple store and simply asking iPhone buyers what they were doing with the devices .
Those few ( new ) Going Private readers that had any faith in equity analysts will now be reevaluating their confidence therein .
But all this is very much like Apple .
Those users that really want to fill their iPhone with useful applications ( once I discovered you could put an HP 12c on your iPhone , my fate was sealed ) can get away with it without much effort and without blowing up their phone .
Suddenly , rather than needing a network provider to subsidize the hardware costs because consumers wo n't even pay $ 100 for a chunk of Nokia fertilizer , <s > $ 600 </ s>$ 500 out of your own pocket does n't seem crazy for a phone .
It was only crazy back when you thought you were just buying a phone .
Or , should I say , what passed for a phone .
If Apple follows the experiment to its logical conclusion , we should see them buying a wireless provider one of these days .
Or building one .
Flat fee for ( true ) unlimited data could n't be far behind .
Could it ?
Why do I love Apple , despite all peer pressure and conventional wisdom ?
They understand that superior products kill three porter birds with one stone .
They eliminate substitutes , increase development costs ( and therefore reduce new entry threats ) and decrease supplier power .
Locking consumers into a closed system only gets you one , and pisses your revenue source off at the same time .
Why do I love Apple ?
They intend to make money because of my desires , not despite them .
At $ 4 , Everybody Gets Rational
WASHINGTON --
So now we know :
The price point is $ 4 .
At $ 3 a gallon , Americans just grin and bear it , suck it up , and , while complaining profusely , keep driving like crazy .
At $ 4 , it is a world transformed .
Americans become rational creatures .
Mass transit ridership is at a 50 - year high .
Driving is down 4 percent .
( Any U.S. decline is something close to a miracle . )
Hybrids and compacts are flying off the lots .
SUV sales are in free fall .
The wholesale flight from gas guzzlers is stunning in its swiftness , but utterly predictable .
Everything has a price point .
Remember that " love affair " with SUVs ?
Love , it seems , has its price too .
America 's sudden change in car - buying habits makes suitable mockery of that absurd debate Congress put on last December on fuel efficiency standards .
At stake was precisely what miles - per - gallon average would every car company 's fleet have to meet by precisely what date .
It was one out - of - a- hat number ( 35 mpg ) compounded by another ( by 2020 ) .
It involved , as always , dozens of regulations , loopholes and throws at a dartboard .
And we already knew from past history what the fleet average number does .
When oil is cheap and everybody wants a gas guzzler , fuel efficiency standards force manufacturers to make cars that nobody wants to buy .
When gas prices go through the roof , this agent of inefficiency becomes an utter redundancy .
At $ 4 a gallon , the fleet composition is changing spontaneously and overnight , not over the 13 years mandated by Congress .
( Even Stalin had the modesty to restrict himself to five - year plans . )
Just Tuesday , GM announced that it would shutter four SUV and truck plants , add a third shift to its compact and midsize sedan plants in Ohio and Michigan , and green light for 2010 the Chevy Volt , an electric hybrid .
Some things , like renal physiology , are difficult .
Some things , like Arab - Israeli peace , are impossible .
And some things are preternaturally simple .
You want more fuel - efficient cars ?
Do n't regulate .
Do n't mandate .
Do n't scold .
Do n't appeal to the better angels of our nature .
Do one thing :
Hike the cost of gas until you find the price point .
Unfortunately , instead of hiking the price ourselves by means of a gasoline tax that could be instantly refunded to the American people in the form of lower payroll taxes , we let the Saudis , Venezuelans , Russians and Iranians do the taxing for us -- and pocket the money that the tax would have recycled back to the American worker .
This is insanity .
For 25 years and with utter futility ( starting with " The Oil - Bust Panic , " The New Republic , February 1983 ) , I have been advocating the cure : a U.S. energy tax as a way to curtail consumption and keep the money at home .
In this space in May 2004 ( and again in November 2005 ) , I called for " the government -- through a tax -- to establish a new floor for gasoline , " by fully taxing any drop in price below a certain benchmark .
The point was to suppress demand and to keep the savings ( from any subsequent world price drop ) at home in the U.S. Treasury rather than going abroad .
At the time , oil was $ 41 a barrel .
It is now $ 123 .
But instead of doing the obvious -- tax the damn thing -- we go through spasms of destructive alternatives , such as efficiency standards , ethanol mandates , and now a crazy carbon cap - and - trade system the Senate is debating this week .
These are infinitely complex mandates for inefficiency and invitations to corruption .
But they have a singular virtue :
They hide the cost to the American consumer .
Want to wean us off oil ?
Be open and honest .
The British are paying $ 8 a gallon for petrol .
Goldman Sachs is predicting we will be paying $ 6 by next year .
Why have the extra $ 2 ( above the current $ 4 ) go abroad ?
Have it go to the U.S. Treasury as a gasoline tax and be recycled back into lower payroll taxes .
Announce a schedule of gas tax hikes of 50 cents every six months for the next two years .
And put a tax floor under $ 4 gasoline , so that as high gas prices transform the U.S. auto fleet , change driving habits , and thus hugely reduce U.S. demand -- and bring down world crude oil prices -- the American consumer and the American economy reap all of the benefit .
Herewith concludes my annual exercise in futility .
By the time I advocate the tax floor again next year , you 'll be paying for gas in bullion .

Detailed Discussions Were Held About Techniques to Use on al Qaeda Suspects
In dozens of top - secret talks and meetings in the White House , the most senior Bush administration officials discussed and approved specific details of how high - value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency , sources tell ABC News .
The so - called Principals who participated in the meetings also approved the use of “ combined ” interrogation techniques – using different techniques during interrogations , instead of using one method at a time – on terrorist suspects who proved difficult to break , sources said .
Highly placed sources said a handful of top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects – whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding .
The high - level discussions about these “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed – down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
The advisers were members of the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , a select group of senior officials who met frequently to advise President Bush on issues of national security policy .
At the time , the Principals Committee included Vice President Cheney , former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , as well as CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
As the national security adviser , Rice chaired the meetings , which took place in the White House Situation Room and were typically attended by most of the principals or their deputies .
Contacted by ABC News today , spokesmen for Tenet , Rumsfeld and Powell declined to comment about the interrogation program or their private discussions in Principals Meetings .
Powell said through an assistant there were “ hundreds of [ Principals ] meetings ” on a wide variety of topics and that he was “ not at liberty to discuss private meetings . ”
The White House also declined comment on behalf of Rice and Cheney .
Ashcroft could not be reached for comment today .
Critics at home and abroad have harshly criticized the interrogation program , which pushed the limits of international law and , they say , condoned torture .
Bush and his top aides have consistently defended the program .
They say it is legal and did not constitute torture .
“ I can say that questioning the detainees in this program has given us the information that has saved innocent lives by helping us stop new attacks here in the United States and across the world , ” Bush said in a speech in September 2006 .
In interview with ABC ’s Charles Gibson last year , Tenet said : “ It was authorized .
It was legal , according to the Attorney General of the United States . ”
But this is the first time sources have disclosed that a handful of the most senior advisers in the White House explicitly approved the details of the program .
According to multiple sources , it was members of the Principals Committee that not only discussed specific plans and specific interrogation methods , but approved them .
The discussions and meetings occurred in an atmosphere of great concern that another terror attack on the nation was imminent .
Sources said the extraordinary involvement of the senior advisers in the grim details of exactly how individual interrogations would be conducted showed how seriously officials took the al Qaeda threat .
It started after the CIA captured top al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah in spring 2002 in Faisalabad , Pakistan .
When his safe house was raided by Pakistani security forces along with FBI and CIA agents , Zubaydah was shot three times during the gun battle .
At a time when virtually all counterterrorist professionals viewed another attack as imminent – and with information on al Qaeda scarce – the detention of Zubaydah was seen as a potentially critical breakthrough .
Zubaydah was taken to the local hospital , where CIA agent John Kiriakou , who helped coordinate Zubaydah ’s capture , was ordered to remain at the wounded captive ’s side at all times .
“ I ripped up a sheet and tied him to the bed , ” Kiriakou said .
But after Zubaydah recovered from his wounds at a secret CIA prison in Thailand , he was uncooperative .
“ I told him I had heard he was being a jerk , ” Kiriakou recalled .
“ I said , ‘ These guys can make it easy on you or they can make it hard . ’
It was after that he became defiant . ”
The CIA wanted to use more aggressive – and physical – methods to get information .
The agency briefed high - level officials in the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , led by then - National Security Advisor Rice and including then - Attorney General Ashcroft , which then signed off on the plan , sources said .
It is unclear whether anyone on the committee objected to the CIA ’s plans for Zubaydah .
The CIA has confirmed Zubaydah was one of three al Qaeda suspects subjected to waterboarding .
After he was waterboarded , officials say Zubaydah gave up valuable information that led to the capture of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammad and fellow 9/11 plotter Ramzi bin al - Shibh .
Mohammad was also subjected to waterboarding by the CIA .
At a hearing before a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay on March 10 , 2007 , KSM , as he is known , said he broke under the harsh interrogation .
COURT : Were any statements you made as the result of any of the treatment that you received during that time frame from 2003 to 2006 ?
Did you make those statements because of the treatment you receive from these people ?
KSM : Statement for whom ?
COURT : To any of these interrogators .
KSM : CIA peoples .
Yes .
At the beginning , when they transferred me …
Lawyers in the Justice Department had written a classified memo , which was extensively reviewed , that gave formal legal authority to government interrogators to use the “ enhanced ” questioning tactics on suspected terrorist prisoners .
The August 2002 memo , signed by then head of the Office of Legal Counsel Jay Bybee , was referred to as the so - called “ Golden Shield ” for CIA agents , who worried they would be held liable if the harsh interrogations became public .
Old hands in the intelligence community remembered vividly how past covert operations , from the Vietnam War-era “ Phoenix Program ” of assassinations of Viet Cong to the Iran - Contra arms sales of the 1980s were painted as the work of a “ rogue agency ” out of control .
But even after the “ Golden Shield ” was in place , briefings and meetings in the White House to discuss individual interrogations continued , sources said .
Tenet , seeking to protect his agents , regularly sought confirmation from the NSC principals that specific interrogation plans were legal .
According to a former CIA official involved in the process , CIA headquarters would receive cables from operatives in the field asking for authorization for specific techniques .
Agents , worried about overstepping their boundaries , would await guidance in particularly complicated cases dealing with high - value detainees , two CIA sources said .
Highly placed sources said CIA directors Tenet and later Porter Goss along with agency lawyers briefed senior advisers , including Cheney , Rice , Rumsfeld and Powell , about detainees in CIA custody overseas .
“ It kept coming up .
CIA wanted us to sign off on each one every time , ” said one high - ranking official who asked not to be identified .
“ They ’d say , ‘ We ’ve got so and so .
This is the plan . ' ”
Sources said that at each discussion , all the Principals present approved .
“ These discussions were n’t adding value , ” a source said .
“ Once you make a policy decision to go beyond what you used to do and conclude it ’s legal , ( you should ) just tell them to implement it . ”
Then - Attorney General Ashcroft was troubled by the discussions .
He agreed with the general policy decision to allow aggressive tactics and had repeatedly advised that they were legal .
But he argued that senior White House advisers should not be involved in the grim details of interrogations , sources said .
According to a top official , Ashcroft asked aloud after one meeting : “ Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . ”
The Principals also approved interrogations that combined different methods , pushing the limits of international law and even the Justice Department ’s own legal approval in the 2002 memo , sources told ABC News .
At one meeting in the summer of 2003 – attended by Vice President Cheney , among others – Tenet made an elaborate presentation for approval to combine several different techniques during interrogations , instead of using one method at a time , according to a highly placed administration source .
A year later , amidst the outcry over unrelated abuses of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib , the controversial 2002 legal memo , which gave formal legal authorization for the CIA interrogation program of the top al Qaeda suspects , leaked to the press .
A new senior official in the Justice Department , Jack Goldsmith , withdrew the legal memo – the Golden Shield – that authorized the program .
But the CIA had captured a new al Qaeda suspect in Asia .
Sources said CIA officials that summer returned to the Principals Committee for approval to continue using certain “ enhanced interrogation techniques . ”
Then - National Security Advisor Rice , sources said , was decisive .
Despite growing policy concerns – shared by Powell – that the program was harming the image of the United States abroad , sources say she did not back down , telling the CIA : “ This is your baby .
Go do it . ”

Senator Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , has pulled even among white voters in New York State with Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , and now has a commanding overall lead over Mr. McCain , 50 percent to 36 percent , according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday .
The survey suggests that New York remains a securely blue state , notwithstanding disappointment over the defeat of its home state senator , Hillary Rodham Clinton , by Mr. Obama in the Democratic nominating contests .
Mr. Obama , of Illinois , received 42 percent of white votes in the poll , compared with 43 percent for Mr. McCain , of Arizona .
Black voters backed Mr. Obama , 87 percent to 6 percent , as did voters under age 45 , 59 percent to 29 percent .
Mr. Obama held similar , if smaller , majorities among voters over age 45 ( 45 percent to 40 percent ) , men ( 45 percent to 40 percent ) and women ( 53 percent to 32 percent ) .
The last Quinnipiac poll , conducted in April when Senator Clinton was still in the race , found a lead of only 47 percent to 39 percent in a hypothetical Obama - McCain matchup .
In that survey , white voters backed Mr. McCain , 48 percent to 38 percent , over Mr. Obama .
The new poll was conducted June 3 - 8 among 1,388 New York State voters .
The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points .
Most New York State Democrats in the new survey said that Mr. Obama should pick Mrs. Clinton as his running mate ( 53 percent to 35 percent ) , while Republican voters resoundingly opposed the idea ( 62 percent to 27 percent ) , as did most independent voters ( 53 percent to 41 percent ) .
“ Our favorite daughter , Senator Hillary Clinton , wo n’t be on top of the ballot , but New York is still solidly blue , ” Maurice Carroll , director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute and a former Times reporter , said in a statement .
“ Senator Barack Obama wins in a walk .
He pulls even with Senator John McCain among white voters .
And he mesmerizes the young .
In the 18 - to - 44 age bracket , he blows McCain away . ”
Mr. Obama scored higher than Mr. McCain in terms of favorability .
A larger majority agreed that Mr. Obama cared about their needs and problems than Mr. McCain did .
Overwhelming majorities said that Mr. McCain ’s age ( 70 percent ) and Mr. Obama ’s race ( 85 percent ) would not affect their decision .
“ You have to be careful when you ask about prejudices , ” Mr. Carroll said .
“ Do people tell the truth ?
Still , New Yorkers tell us , heavily , they ’re not prejudiced because of McCain ’s age , and , overwhelmingly , they ’re not prejudiced because of Obama ’s race . ”
New Yorkers listed the economy as the single most important issue in the presidential race , followed by the war in Iraq and health care .
More than three - quarters of the respondents — 76 percent — described the state ’s economy as “ not so good ” or “ poor . ”
That included 84 percent of upstate voters , 66 percent of New York City voters and 75 percent of suburban voters .
An identical proportion — again , 75 percent — disapproved of President Bush ’s job performance .
Even Republicans were split on the question , 47 percent to 47 percent ; 20 percent of those surveyed said they approved of the job Mr. Bush was doing .

The Lebanese army has so far not intervened in the clashes The Lebanese army has said it is prepared to use force to disarm gunmen and restore order across the country .
It follows a week of clashes between supporters of the Western - backed government and the Hezbollah - led opposition .
The latest violence has left more than 60 people dead .
Saudi Arabia has criticised Iran for supporting what it called a coup by Hezbollah .
It said it would affect its relations with Arab countries .
There is now a strong Lebanese army presence in Beirut , the northern city of Tripoli and in the Chouf mountains south - east of the capital .
But correspondents say much of Beirut remains paralysed by street barricades , and the international airport is still closed .
The recent sectarian violence is the worst since the end of the 15 - year civil war in 1990 and has led to fears of another all - out conflict .
A military statement said : " Army units will prevent any violations , whether by individuals or groups , in accordance with the law even if this is going to lead to the use of force . "
' Hezbollah coup ' Saudi Arabia , a strong supporter of the Lebanese government , has called for all Middle Eastern states to respect the independence of Lebanon .
High stakes in Lebanon crisis " For Iran to back the coup that happened in Lebanon will have an impact on its relations with all Arab countries , " the Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al - Faisal warned on Tuesday .
In Tehran , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denied his country was meddling in Lebanon .
" Iran is the only country not interfering , " he told a news conference .
The recent unrest began after the government moved to shut down Hezbollah 's telecoms network and remove the chief of security at Beirut 's airport for allegedly sympathising with Hezbollah .
The army has stayed neutral in the conflict emerging as the only factor preventing a complete collapse in Lebanon .
It is generally agreed that its commander , General Michel Suleiman , should be the next president .
Political deadlock
For the past 16 months , Lebanon has been locked in political stalemate between the ruling coalition and Hezbollah - led opposition over the make - up of the government .
Lebanon has not had a president since November , when Emile Lahoud stepped down despite parliament failing to agree on his successor .
Lebanon was plunged into civil war from 1975 - 90 , drawing in Syria and Israel .
Many Lebanese are now wondering where the latest crisis will go from here .
An Arab League delegation trying to mediate an end to the fighting is expected to arrive in Lebanon on Wednesday .

The US President George W Bush has also said he will discuss developments when he visits the region this week - visiting Saudi Arabia and Egypt .
In an interview with the BBC he said he had offered to help strengthen Lebanon 's army so it can disarm Hezbollah .
The US is also sending its guided missile destroyer the USS Cole back into the Eastern Mediterranean .
Its action has angered Lebanon 's Hezbollah - led opposition .
Sources have warned that any hint of American intervention would lead it to abandon the few red lines it has observed in its campaign to undermine the government .

ROCHESTER - U.S. Senate candidate Al Franken took the DFL endorsement by acclamation on Saturday , after a day of questions , speeches and fretting by some activists over whether the controversial satirist can wage a focused campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Sen.
Norm Coleman .
After being publicly and privately urged to do so , Franken tackled the issue of his sometimes sexually explicit humor head on , with the outright apology that many had been waiting for .
" It kills me that things I said and wrote sent a message ... that they can't count on me to be a champion for women , for all Minnesotans .
I 'm sorry for that .
Because that 's not who I am , " Franken told delegates .
Franken acknowledged that in his often edgy career as a comedian .
" I wrote a lot of jokes .
Some of them were n't funny .
Some of them were n't appropriate .
Some of them were downright offensive .
I understand that . "
Franken then turned attention to Coleman , saying that " there are some people in Washington who could afford to feel a little less comfortable . "
Drawing on his strength as an acerbic critic of Republicans , Franken said that he would " stand up to Norm Coleman in a way he 's never been stood up to before . "
In the end , DFLers agreed with Franken and were preparing to endorse him on the first ballot when Franken 's rival , Jack Nelson - Pallmeyer withdrew .
Franken had garnered nearly 62 percent of the votes , slightly more than needed for endorsement .
Franken said he accepted endorsement in a " spirit of tremendous gratitude and tremendous humility " and would dedicate himself to the tasks of securing universal health care , leveling the economic playing field , improving educational opportunities and withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq .
" We have a lot of work to do together , " he told cheering delegates .
" We 're going to canvass until our feet hurt , and when our feet hurt , we 'll pick up the phone .
...
We 're going to do it because five million Minnesotans need a voice in Washington and they do n't have one in Norm Coleman . "
In a passionate acceptance speech , Franken said he offered the combined ability to take Coleman to task while laying out a hopeful vision that would propel Democrats to reclaim the Senate seat once held by DFL icon Paul Wellstone .
Republicans ready
Republicans were ready with a line of attack that pegged Franken as their " dream candidate . "
State Republican chairman Ron Carey said that Minnesotans would not be fooled by what he called an " eleventh - hour apology made out of political necessity . "
Carey hinted broadly that the GOP would have additional revelations about Franken , who has taken a pounding in recent weeks for tax problems and for his often profane style of humor .
Franken said that further broadsides against him reflected an effort by Republicans to make the race " about anything but Norm Coleman 's record . "
Franken came into the convention on Friday dogged by controversy over a soft - porn parody written for Playboy in 2000 and an earlier skit involving an imagined rape that he once pitched during his " Saturday Night Live " days .
Some Nelson - Pallmeyer supporters took defeat hard .
As Nelson - Pallmeyer gave a concession speech Saturday , a young supporter wearing a green - and - white campaign shirt and a headset stood in the back of the hall , accepted hugs and cried slightly .
She raised her hands high above her head as Nelson - Pallmeyer finished speaking .
Asked by a reporter whether she could comment on the defeat she bowed her head .
" I 'd rather not , I 'm sorry , " she said .
Speaking to reporters shortly after endorsement , Franken again acknowledged that he was n't " a perfect person . "
The coming campaign , he said , should revolve around the issues that matter to Minnesotans .
But few expected that Franken will be able to avoid continuing attacks on past writings that some have found demeaning to women .
State Rep. Nora Slawik , a delegate and early supporter , wondered aloud whether voters would be as forgiving of Franken as party activists .
" We know we 're going to be on defense with Franken , " she said , her mouth tightening with worry .
" Will that hurt us ?
I support him , but I do worry . "
U.S. Sen . Amy Klobuchar , who had remained neutral throughout the Senate contest , had publicly urged Franken to apologize .
After his endorsement , she sought him out on stage and held his hand aloft in a gesture of solidarity that brought thunderous applause from DFLers .
" We 're going into this unified , " said DFL state party chair Brian Melendez .
But two of Franken 's earlier critics , U.S. Reps .
Betty McCollum and Jim Oberstar , were notably absent from the stage when Franken accepted the endorsement .
Mari Urness Pokornowski of Cokato , president of the DFL Feminist Caucus , resigned Saturday when she learned that her group had endorsed Franken .
As a mother and former teacher , she said , she did n't see how Franken 's writings represented rural Minnesota values .
The endorsement , she said , " was a choice made by the caucus , and once that decision is made , you have to make a choice where you stand , For me , my decision was to step down . "
Years of work paid off
With red , white and blue confetti fluttering down , pounding rock anthems and an all - star line of DFL officials , Saturday 's endorsement was a stark contrast to last week 's far quieter , uncontested Republican endorsement of Coleman .
Energized by a day of spirited exchanges , some delegates wasted little time in jumping on the Franken bandwagon .
As Nelson - Pallmeyer was giving his concession speech , Diana Slyter of Minneapolis was busy pinning a blue - and - white Al Franken button atop her Nelson - Pallmeyer shirt .
" Now , Franken 's endorsed .
I 'm supporting him , " she said .
She also held two large Franken campaign signs .
" I 'll put these on my [ motorcycle ] sidecar , " she added .
Franken had built a strong grass - roots campaign before his entry in the Senate race , launching a Midwest Values political action committee that raised money for DFL candidates across the state as far back as 2005 .
On Saturday , connections forged over years paid off .
In March , Mr. Brodkorb reported that Mr. Franken ’s corporation , Alan Franken Inc. , owed $ 25,000 to the state compensation board in New York for failing to carry workers ’ compensation insurance from 2002 to 2005 .
State officials said they sent Mr. Franken numerous letters on the matter , but received no answer .

Andy Barr , a spokesman for the campaign , said Mr. Franken had not known of the oversight by the corporation ( which consisted of Mr. Franken , his wife , Franni , and an assistant or two ) , and received none of the letters .
The state ’s letters were sent to the Frankens ’
New York apartment , officials there say ; the couple moved to Minnesota at the end of 2005 , though the family still owns the apartment .
In April , Mr. Brodkorb wrote that Mr. Franken ’s company was in forfeiture in California .
Other reporters found the reason : California authorities said Mr. Franken ’s company had failed to pay franchise tax fees from 2003 to 2006 , and owed nearly $ 5 , ooo , which Mr. Franken has since paid .
Mr. Franken ’s company paid no franchise taxes to the state in those years , Mr. Barr said , because Mr. Franken believed his accounting firm had shut down the corporation in 2002 .
The reports led Mr. Franken to hire a new team of financial advisers to review his finances .
Late last month , Mr. Franken announced the findings : although he had paid state income tax on his earnings , his accountant had , in some cases , paid it to the wrong states .
Like baseball players , entertainers are required to pay taxes to states where they earn money .
He had paid more than $ 917,000 in state taxes to New York and Minnesota from 2003 to 2006 , but should have sent parts of about that sum ( the total should have been about $ 4,000 higher ) to 17 other states where he performed .
Mr. Franken ’s supporters , and several Democratic - leaning blogs , have dismissed the problems as meaningless , an accountant ’s bureaucratic errors .
“ We ’re in two wars and a recession , ” Mr. Barr said .
“ This is not the time to try to have an election about something else . ”
Still the campaign has clearly worried : it created an emergency phone bank one evening to call the more than 1,300 Democratic convention delegates and alternates and deliver the news before it came out the next day in the newspapers .
Many state Democrats ( here , the party is known as the DFL for the Democratic - Farmer - Labor Party ) dismiss Mr. Brodkorb as a mouthpiece for accusations the Republicans dig up and want to present somewhere more likely to catch on than a press release .
Indeed , Mr. Brodkorb , 34 , once worked on the campaigns of Republican leaders including Mr. Coleman and last year managed ( without pay ) the campaign of Ron Carey to become the state ’s Republican chairman .
A Navy judge has barred a Pentagon legal advisor from participating in the war crimes trial of Osama bin Laden ’s former driver , saying the advisor lacks independence .
Air Force Brig .
Gen. Thomas W. Hartmann , legal advisor to the military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , must be replaced before next month ’s scheduled trial of Salim Ahmed Hamdan , Capt .
Keith J. Allred ruled Friday .
Hartmann ’s office did not immediately return messages seeking comment .
At an April 28 hearing , former chief prosecutor Air Force Col. Morris D. Davis testified that Hartmann had pushed for “ sexy ” cases that would capture attention .

Defense lawyers say Hartmann rushed proceedings in hope of speedy convictions and sought improperly to select cases based on their potential to sway public opinion of the tribunal process .
Hartmann ’s job is to counsel the official who makes key decisions such as whether to approve charges against individual Guantanamo detainees .
Prosecutors argued that Hartmann never subjected subordinates to unlawful influence .
Friday ’s ruling directly affects only Hamdan ’s case , but a civilian attorney for Hamdan said it raised questions about the validity of charges that Hartmann was involved in preparing against other terrorism suspects at Guantanamo .
This article is a brief tutorial in how to make your own ascii internet TV station .
I say brief , its pretty simple - that 's why its brief .
The inspiration for such an article comes from having a telnet link posted in a channel to a server which was showing a World Cup game live via ascii and sockets .
I pasted this around to a couple other people and some folk did n't understand how it worked , so I wanted to share some knowledge .
Incase some of you are n't following me , the link I was shown was
14:05 <+JonathanD > telnet ascii-wm.net 2006 14:05 <+ JonathanD > watch teh world cup , in ascii 14:05 <+ JonathanD > someone topic that 14:09 <+ linkd > thats pretty leet Incidently this server is still up and running ( checked on 2008 - 01 - 31 ) so you can go and watch this archived match for yourself !
I 'm sure everyone has seen picture to ascii converters before .
There are certain programs which will take an image in and approximate it in ascii .
One program which does is the aalib library .
And thats what I 'll be using in this tutorial .

Ca n't see the picture ?
Step further back .
It 's hard to see when it 's a static image Lets check off what we 'll need for this :
A server or computer with an internet connection
A copy of mplayer with aalib support
A copy of netcat
Any video mplayer can play
For this tutorial I will be using a fictional server called ascii.nullnetwork.net and episode 3 of Pure Pwnage will be what I 'm broadcasting .
There are two ways to go about setting up your server , the first is to transcode and steam at the same time .
~$ nc -vvlp 5050 - c ' mplayer - vo aa Pure_Pwnage_103.avi ' listening on [ any ] 5050 ...
The second ( and my preferred method ) is to make ' encodings ' of any media you wish you broadcast .
An ascii encoding can be made by a simple command :
~$ mplayer - vo aa Pure_Pwnage_103.avi > purepwnage.asc
Linux RTC init error in ioctl ( rtc_irqp_set 1024 ) : Permission denied VO : [ aa ] cannot open / dev/vcsa06 for writing , so we 'll not use linux driver ~$
To then set up the server I use netcat
~$ nc -vvlp 5050 < purepwnage.asc listening on [ any ] 5050 ...
Simple !
The latter method will use more diskspace but will save on processing power .
To connect to view the stream you simply telnet or netcat in to the server .
~$ telnet ascii.nullnetwork.net 5050
Remember to make sure port 5050 is accessible though !
Or you 'll be hitting a brick wall wondering why it is n't working .
So how does all this work ?
Well , to explain how this works you will need to know that with mplayer you can specify output drivers using the - vo switch .
The output driver that mplayer will recognise to use aalib is aa .
So the arguments we pass to mplayer are - vo aa then the video file .
Other output drivers include sdl , svga , x11 , vesa and so on ( see man page for more information ) .
Using - vo aa will prompt mplayer to convert the video to ascii as it outputs .
Now in the first method where we save an encoding , we are simply taking whatever mplayer outputs and redirecting it to a file .
So thats how we generate our image .
To send it over a connection however we need to set up a small server to send it to people who connect , we accomplish this with netcat .
We give netcat a few important instructions .
The first set of switchs ( - vv ) are purely personal preference and cause netcat to be uber verbose .
We also tell netcat to list on port 5050 by providing the - lp 5050 arguments .
You may use any port you like but I choose 5050 because 5050 is hexadecimal for the ascii string " PP " ( aka Pure pwnage ) .
In the first method we simply then pipe a file into netcat to output .
However the in second method the finial switch we provide runs the arguement when someone connects , so our netcat will run mplayer - vo aa Pure_Pwnage_103.avi and send the output through the socket .
You can do this with any video that mplayer can play .
You however will lose your audio stream as neither telnet or netcat processes audio , and mplayer does n't output the audio data when you pipe it like I did .
In the World Cup server they got a live feed , I assume by use of a TV Card or such , which I 'm told ( and implied by the man page ) that mplayer can also handle .
However I do n't own a TV Card so I do n't exactly know how to do that , but if you do know , let me know !
Have fun kids

The vision was grand : Develop a cheap laptop and get it into the hands of 150 million school children in the developing world .
Making the computer turned out to be the easy part .
On Wednesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Nicholas Negroponte , founder of One Laptop Per Child , showed off the $ 200 XO .
The innovative computer sports a bright screen readable in sunshine and a highly efficient battery that can be recharged by cranking it .
But One Laptop has run into controversy – a corporate partner and the group 's chief technology officer pulled out in recent weeks – which has experts noting perils for the broader social entrepreneur movement .
Social entrepreneurs , who aim to solve social problems using business - world principles , have tackled everything from expanding rural credit to marketing indigenous crafts in recent years .
But experts say the problems at One Laptop point to a challenge for these emerging entrepreneurs .
They often excel at trailblazing new markets among the world 's poor but struggle to achieve large - scale sales and distribution .
" In many respects , these social entrepreneurs are pathfinders , they are like the research and development for bigger players that have otherwise ignored the bottom of the pyramid market , " says James Koch , a professor at Santa Clara University in California .
For example , One Laptop 's XO has proven the concept of cheap laptops .
Companies like Lenovo and Intel , sensing the market potential , are now working on their own models .
This is n't necessarily bad for One Laptop 's ultimate goal .
" Part of our model of success is to have competition , to have other people in this space , " says Walter Bender , president of software and content at One Laptop .
" We do n't need to be the monopoly or biggest player in the market . "
But the competitors ' products are n't helping One Laptop 's efforts to secure big orders .
So far , it has orders for 500,000 laptops , with more than 100,000 already en route to places such as Afghanistan and Haiti .
But it 's far behind its goal to sell 150 million units by the end of 2008 .
One reason for the shortfall , One Laptop alleges , is that a former partner – Intel – was disparaging the XO as it developed its own ultra-cheap laptop , the Classmate .
" Their sales people were saying , ' Because we 're on the board , we have inside info and we know that everything is broken and it does n't work , ' " says Mr. Bender .
Intel has told a different story , saying that Mr. Negroponte was unreasonably demanding that the company stop marketing the Classmate in regions targeted by One Laptop .
Intel did n't respond to an interview request .
Partnerships with multinational corporations can be double - edged swords for nonprofit startups .
On the one hand , they 're one of the quickest ways for startups to ramp up delivery of a product .
On the other hand , nonprofits and corporations have different bottom lines , which means that such partnerships need to develop slowly and carefully , says Nora Silver , director of the Center for Nonprofit and Public Leadership at the University of California , Berkeley .
A successful partnership between clothing - manufacturer Timberland and CityYear , a nationwide volunteer corps , took years to forge .
The Intel partnership , however , seemed hasty and did n't integrate the sales force into the effort , Dr. Silver says .
" Did these folks have a clear contract ? " she asks .
" You have to be very clear about such basic agreements . "
One Laptop was acting as if they had a contract with exclusivity and noncompete clauses , she adds .
Bender says there was only a nondisparage agreement .
The difficulty of scaling up a business is n't limited to social entrepreneurs .
For - profit startups struggle with it , too .
But entrepreneurs have a bigger challenge when they target poor people , especially those who are uneducated and live in remote areas .
Traditional marketing campaigns on TV and billboards may miss these customers entirely .
And putting the product on shelves may not be enough .
The entrepreneurs may have to find ways to advance small loans to would - be buyers .
They may have to find indigenous nonprofit groups that could open markets that a corporation would never devote the time or have the credibility to crack .
One Laptop decided to target ministries of education to get bulk orders for schools .
Working with those agencies , even in the developed world , requires a lot of effort and patience , notes John Quelch , a professor at the Harvard Business School .
" One of the knocks against [ One Laptop ] could be that they focused very much at achieving a price point for the product , but did n't necessarily focus as much on developing a solution for the ministry of education for country X , " says Dr. Quelch , adding that this can be a common pitfall .
" Initially , we had three or four people doing that around the globe , which is a stretch , " says Bender .
One Laptop is now working closely with Brightstar , the world 's largest cellphone distributor , to help with global logistics .
Friendswood principal leaves after ' Islam 101 ' controversy Principal has new job after ' Islam 101 ' controversy
Parents outraged over assembly allowed by Friendswood Junior High leader
The Friendswood Junior High principal who outraged some parents by allowing an Islamic group to make a 40 - minute presentation to students last month is now off the job .
In a two - sentence statement sent late Wednesday , the school district said Robin Lowe " has accepted another administrative position effective immediately . "
The news drew relief from some who were incensed by the May 22 presentation and concern from others who considered the assembly a good way for students in the predominantly Anglo Christian school to learn about other cultures .
About 875 seventh - and eighth - grade students attended the presentation given by two women with the Council on American - Islamic Relations in Houston , according to the school district .
The president of the nonprofit council , Tarek Hussein , said he contacted Lowe about conducting an educational presentation after hearing from a father who said his son was physically attacked at the school because he is Muslim .
" It was physical harassment .
I believe the boy has a medical report , " Hussein said , declining to provide details of the incident because he did not have the family 's consent .
Officials with CAIR have described the presentation as " Islam 101 . "
But parents and community members began flooding the district with complaints after the assembly became a hot topic on Houston talk - radio station 950 AM .
Authorized for staff
On Saturday , Friendswood Superintendent Trish Hanks sent a memo to parents and community members saying that she had authorized the presentation for staff only — not for students .
She said she had asked her deputy superintendent , Sherry Green , to express that sentiment to Lowe .
" It is obvious now , " Hanks wrote , " that a misunderstanding occurred between two very competent and dedicated administrators . "
State law allows parents to remove their children from a class or activity that conflicts with their religious or moral beliefs , but schools are not required to send home permission slips before conducting potentially controversial lessons , said Debbie Ratcliffe , a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency .
Hanks , in her letter , described Friendswood as " a faith - based community " and apologized to parents .
" My concern for our community and for our students is not as much with the content of the presentation as explained to me , " she wrote , " but with the fact that a group had an audience with our students without consent from parents or this administration . "
" I am not surprised by the community 's reaction , " she continued .
" Most of you receiving this letter have had years of experience with this district and know the kinds of activities your child has been exposed to in school .
This was an isolated incident and a mistake . "
Hanks did not respond to a phone message left late Wednesday , and her spokeswoman could not be reached for comment .
Lowe also could not be reached .
David Bradley , a member of the State Board of Education whose district includes Friendswood , said parents have been contacting him to express outrage about the presentation .
He said an assembly about Islam was a waste of tax dollars and was not an appropriate response to an attack on a student .
" There 's a personal incident between two students and as a result of that we 're going to yank everyone out of class ? " he said .
" I got beat up in junior high .
Did my dad go down and force all the kids to sit through sensitivity training in their P.E. class ?
No , that 's absurd .
The coach gave us licks and sent us home .
That was the end of those incidents . "
Discussed facts
Asma Siddiqi , one of the presenters with the American - Islamic council , said she simply discussed facts about Islam , sticking to a PowerPoint slide show .
The council provided a copy of the presentation to the Houston Chronicle .
Titled " Islam : Respecting Diversity , " it discusses the size of the Muslim population , the basic tenets of the religion and the dating customs .
" I presented who Muslims are and the beliefs they have , " said Siddiqi , the local council 's communications director .
" It was also focusing on getting to know your Muslim classmates better . "
Hussein said his organization has done a similiar presentation in the Clear Creek school district and he plans to ask other districts for an opportunity to present because Muslim students often get teased and called " terrorists " since the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" We have to be good to each other and understand each other better , " he said .
" That 's why we offer this program . "

OpenOffice.org 2.4 is now released and ushers in new features , bug fixes , and performance improvements .
Chart improvements
Six months ago , OpenOffice.org 2.3.0 introduced the rewritten " chart2 " module with the promise it would be the foundation for future development .
Now OpenOffice.org 2.4 delivers on that promise with 9 new chart features .
A click adds the regression equation to a regression curve .
In a double axis bar chart , the bars can be drawn side by side ( instead of overlapping ) .
Usually the higher a bar reaches in a bar graph , the higher its value .
However , sometimes an upside - down chart better represents the data .
Ca n't decide between showing the value and showing the percentage ?
Show both .
As the amount of information in a data label grows , it may be necessary to move some onto a separate line .
Tweak the position of data labels .
Choose any number format independent of the data source .
Guess which pie chart uses the new Best fit placement option and which uses Outside .
3D slide transitions
Impress 2.4 enables extensions for slide transitions , and an extension will soon be released with ten 3D OpenGL transitions .
Rectangular selection
Certain layouts in Writer , such as OCR scans and tables made with tabs , benefit from selecting text in block mode .
More powerful regular expressions
To search for complex text patterns or transform volumes of text with automation , turn to regular expressions .
In 2.4 , regular expressions get a boost with backreferences , referencing a group in the subject from the replacement field .
Applications include changing the formats of dates ( see illustration below ) and redacting Social Security Numbers .
PDF export enhancements
OpenOffice.org is renowned for its powerful , integrated PDF export , and version 2.4 broadens PDF capabilities even further .
PDF / A - 1 is the new standard for long - term document retention , and OpenOffice.org supports it .
Impress and Draw export page names as PDF bookmarks .
When publishing to the web , CD - ROM , or a local network , export URLs relative to file system is handy for creating relative links .
Export bookmarks as named designations creates anchors to reference specific places in documents ( such as chapter 5 in Writer document ) from other documents ( such a web page ) .
Convert document references to PDF targets facilitates reuse of the same links by converting ODF file name extensions to PDF only in the PDF .
Finally , the Cross - document links defines the behavior for links clicked in PDF files .
Easier selection of language for spell checking
Polyglots will delight in three new ways to quickly switch the language for spell checking .
Pictured is the new context menu ( which pops up after a right click ) in Writer .
Insert picture as slide background
Instead of invoking arcane incantations , just right click to set the background picture for a slide in Impress .
Convert text to columns
Calc can split delimited text into multiple cells .
Start with this :
Apply the Text to Columns command .
Then , end up with this :
Enhanced formula input
When filling out Calc spreadsheets , efficient typists can't stray from the number pad .
Yeah , it 's only 30 cm away to the = symbol , but do n't tell them that .
Instead , point out Calc now accepts formulas that begin with the + symbol instead of the = symbol .
Enhanced data input
I like to tell people that a word processor is not a type writer , but now I can say Calc is a type writer — well , a little bit .
After data is typed horizontally , the return key — surprise — returns the cursor to the column where the typing started .
Extensions
Learning from Firefox 's success , OpenOffice.org 2.4 continues to polish extensions to attract more developers , developers , developers .
Now extensions fully integrate into the help system .
When OpenOffice.org automatically checks for OpenOffice.org updates , it also checks for updates to extensions .
When updating extensions , OpenOffice.org will launch the web browser to the appropriate web pages for more convenient updating .
Extensions can have non -geeky - looking display names , but if the publisher omits the display name , the geeky - looking filename is used instead .
Extension publishers can include links to their sites and to release notes .
Custom Word properties
It did n't take Microsoft releasing its documentation for binary formats to add this feature : custom properties defined in Word documents now import and export .
Move cells using drag and drop
Hail new shortcuts for moving , copying , and linking cells in Calc .
Localization
When you can't think of another word that means синоним , just check the new Russian thesaurus .
The 2.4 release also adds 10 languages , several locales , the new Bolivar Fuerte currency , and support for Farsi and Persian numbering .
When a document ( such as a broken . RTF ) , does not provide the locale , OpenOffice.org will assume the system locale .
Looking forward
Breaking recent precedent , there will be no bug - fix release 2.4.1 in 3 months .
It may be released out of schedule while developers will focus on preparing OpenOffice.org 3.0 for final release September 2008 .
Version 3.0 will include Microsoft Office 2007 file format support , ODF 1.2 , improved notes , and PDF import , and performance improvements .
Competition
OpenOffice.org continues to face stiff competition .
Despite the radical interface and file format changes , Microsoft Office 2007 enjoys strong sales and support from third - party developers .
A first step in denting Sharepoint 's enterprise dominance , Google recently expanded its software - as - a - service Google Docs suite with JotSpot , a wiki service , and is laboring to push Google Apps from the web to the desktop with Google Gears .
Still , OpenOffice.org stands out on price , license , broad platform support , OpenDocument file formats , robust PDF export , and rapid development .
Where it took Microsoft four years to make Office 2007 , OpenOffice.org comes out every three to six months .

New process could cause titanium price to tumble
Related images
( click to enlarge )
Whether for stopping cars or bullets , titanium is the material of choice , but it has always been too expensive for all but the most specialized applications .
That could change , however , with a non-melt consolidation process being developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory and industry partners .
The new processing technique could reduce the amount of energy required and the cost to make titanium parts from powders by up to 50 percent , making it feasible to use titanium alloys for brake rotors , artificial joint replacements and , of significant interest now , armor for military vehicles .
“ We recently exhibited the new low - cost titanium alloy door made by ORNL for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle , which is a next - generation combat vehicle , ” said Bill Peter , a researcher in ORNL ’s Materials Science and Technology Division .
“ By using a titanium alloy for the door , BAE Systems was able to reduce the weight of its vehicle yet at the same time decrease the threat of armor- piercing rounds . ”
The lightweight titanium alloy also improves the operation of the door and increases mobility of the vehicle , making it even more useful to the military .
Peter noted that the non-melt approach , which includes roll compaction for directly fabricating sheets from powder , press and sinter techniques to produce net shape components and extrusion , offers many advantages over traditional melt processing .
“ Instead of using conventional melt processing to produce products from titanium powder , with the new method the powders remain in their solid form during the entire procedure , ” Peter said .
“ This saves a tremendous amount of energy required for processing , greatly reduces the amount of scrap and allows for new alloys and engineered composites . ”
While powder metallurgy has been used to produce components for many years , titanium products have not widely been fabricated using these methods because of the high cost of conventional titanium powders .
Now , however , new low - cost titanium powders are enabling ORNL , International Titanium Powders , Ametek and BAE Systems to develop these technologies for titanium .
In coming years , researchers expect lightweight corrosion - resistant titanium alloys to make their way into many other products , including automobiles , which will benefit from the decreased weight and will be able to deliver improved fuel economy .
To whom it may morally concern :
This is a call for technologically educated individuals to come to the aid of freedom .
Please spread this post to other forums .
Tasers work by retaining capacitance ( an electrical charge ) in batteries or capacitors ; they use a voltage transformer to raise voltage to a dangerous level when fired .
They use gunpowder to propel darts forward into the victim , and the electricity is passed through wires .
The electric charge is also " pulsed " ( made to vary rythmically in voltage or amperage ) in order to disrupt the neurons in the victim 's body .
Many people have died from this weapon , and police in the US and worldwide view it as a source for casual punishment without trial , or as a sadistic revenge against anyone they arrest .
How would countermeasures work ?
I call for the simplest , cheapest , and most effective method .
Should protesters have a method ( water ? ) to ground the device ?
Could body capacitance be raised to the point that the devices could be burned out upon firing ?
Could fellow protesters carry nonconductive shears ?
The answer is probably none of the above , but someone out there can figure out a way to make these torture devices as antiquated as the arquebus .
Thanking you in advance ,

The Commodity Futures and Trading Commission ( CFTC ) is investigating trading in oil futures to determine whether the surge in prices to record levels is the result of manipulation or fraud .
They might want to take a look at wheat , rice and corn futures while they 're at it .
The whole thing is a hoax cooked up by the investment banks and hedge funds who are trying to dig their way out of the trillion dollar mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) mess that they created by turning garbage loans into securities .
That scam blew up in their face last August and left them scrounging for handouts from the Federal Reserve .
Now the billions of dollars they 're getting from the Fed is being diverted into commodities which is destabilizing the world economy ; driving gas prices to the moon and triggering food riots across the planet .
For months we 've been told that the soaring price of oil has been the result of Peak Oil , fighting in Iraq , attacks on oil facilities in Nigeria , labor problems in Norway , and ( the all - time favorite ) growth in China .
It 's all baloney .
Just like Goldman Sachs prediction of $ 200 per barrel oil is baloney .
If oil is about to skyrocket then why has G - Sax kept a neutral rating on some of its oil holdings like Exxon Mobile ?
Could it be that they know that oil is just another mega - inflated equity bubble --- like housing , corporate bonds and dot.com stocks - that is about to crash to earth as soon as the big players grab a parachute ?
There are three things that are driving up the price of oil : the falling dollar , speculation and buying on margin .
The dollar is tanking because of the Federal Reserve 's low interest monetary policies have kept interest rates below the rate of inflation for most of the last decade .
Add that to the $ 700 billion current account deficit and a National Debt that has increased from $ 5.8 trillion when Bush first took office to over $ 9 trillion today and it's a wonder the dollar has n't gone " Poof " already .
According to a January 4 editorial in the Wall Street Journal : " If the dollar had remained 'as good as gold ' since 2001 , oil today would be selling at about $ 30 per barrel , not $ 99 . ( today $ 126 per barrel )
The decline of the dollar against gold and oil suggests a US monetary that is supplying too many dollars . "
Wall Street Journal 1-4-08
The price of oil has more than quadrupled since 2001 , from roughly $ 30 per barrel to $ 126 , WITHOUT ANY DISRUPTIONS TO SUPPLY .
There 's no shortage ; it 's just gibberish .
As far as " buying on margin " consider this summary from author William Engdahl : " A conservative calculation is that at least 60 % of today 's $ 128 per barrel price of crude oil comes from unregulated futures speculation by hedge funds , banks and financial groups using the London ICE Futures and New York NYMEX futures exchanges and uncontrolled inter - bank or Over - The - Counter trading to avoid scrutiny .
US margin rules of the government 's Commodity Futures Trading Commission allow speculators to buy a crude oil futures contract on the Nymex , by having to pay only 6 % of the value of the contract .
At today 's price of $ 128 per barrel , that means a futures trader only has to put up about $ 8 for every barrel .
He borrows the other $ 120 .
This extreme " leverage " of 16 to 1 helps drive prices to wildly unrealistic levels and offset bank losses in sub-prime and other disasters at the expense of the overall population . "
So the investment banks and their trading partners at the hedge funds can game the system for a mere 8 bucks per barrel or 16 to 1 leverage .
Not bad , eh ?
Is it possible that gambling on oil futures might be a temptation for banks that are already underwater from a trillion dollars worth of mortgage - related deals that have " gone south " leaving the banking system essentially bankrupt ?
And if the banks and hedgies are not playing this game , then where is the money coming from ?
I have compiled charts and graphs that show that nearly two - thirds of the big investment banks ' revenue came from the securitization of commercial and residential real estate loans .
That market is frozen .
Besides , this is not just a matter of " loan delinquencies " or MBS that have to be written off .
The banks are " revenue starved " .
How are they filling the coffers ?
They 're either neck - deep in interest rate swaps , derivatives trading , or gaming the futures market .
Which is it ?
Of course , there is one other possibility , but if that possibility turned out to be right than it would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the entire financial system .
In fact , it would prove that the system is being rigged from the top - down by our friends at the Banking Politburo , the Federal Reserve .
Here goes :
What if the investment banks are trading their worthless MBS and CDOs at the Fed 's auction facilities and using the money ( $ 400 billion ) to drive up the price of raw materials like rice , corn , wheat , and oil ?
Could it be ?
Could the Fed really be looking the other way so it can bail out its banking buddies while they drive prices skyward ?
If it is true ; ( and I suspect it is ) it has n't done much good .
As the Associated Press reported yesterday : " The Federal Reserve announced Thursday that it will make a fresh batch of short - term cash loans available to squeezed banks as part of an ongoing effort to ease stressed credit markets .
The Fed said it will conduct three auctions in June , with each one making $ 75 billion available in short - term cash loans .
Banks can bid for a slice of the available funds .
It would mark the latest round in a program that the Fed launched in December to help banks overcome credit problems so they will keep lending to customers . "
Another $ 225 billion for the bankers and not a dime for the struggling homeowner !
The Fed is bankrupting the country with their permanent rotating loans to keep reckless speculators from going under .
So much for moral hazard .
As far as speculation , there is ample evidence that the system is being manipulated .
According to MarketWatch : " Speculative activity in commodity markets has grown " enormously " over the past several years , the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said in a news release .
It pointed out that in five years , from 2003 to 2008 , investment in the index funds tied to commodities has grown by 20 - fold -- to $ 260 billion from $ 13 billion . "
And here 's a revealing clip from the testimony of Michael W. Masters of Masters Capital Management , LLC , who addressed the issue of " Commodities Speculation " before the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs this week : " Today , Index Speculators are pouring billions of dollars into the commodities futures markets , speculating that commodity prices will increase .
... In the popular press the explanation given most often for rising oil prices is the increased demand for oil from China .
According to the DOE , annual Chinese demand for petroleum has increased over the last five years from 1.88 billion barrels to 2.8 billion barrels , an increase of 920 million barrels .
8
Over the same five - year period , Index Speculators ' demand for petroleum futures has increased by 848 million barrels .
THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FROM INDEX SPECULATORS IS ALMOST EQUAL TO THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FROM CHINA .
Index Speculators have now stockpiled , via the futures market , the equivalent of 1.1 billion barrels of petroleum , effectively adding eight times as much oil to their own stockpile as the United States has added to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the last five years .
Today , in many commodities futures markets , they are the single largest force .
15
The huge growth in their demand has gone virtually undetected by classically - trained economists who almost never analyze demand in futures markets .
As money pours into the markets , two things happen concurrently : the markets expand and prices rise .
One particularly troubling aspect of Index Speculator demand is that it actually increases the more prices increase .
This explains the accelerating rate at which commodity futures prices ( and actual commodity prices ) are increasing .
The CFTC has taken deliberate steps to allow CERTAIN SPECULATORS VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED ACCESS TO THE COMMODITIES FUTURES MARKETS .
The CFTC has granted Wall Street banks an exemption from speculative position limits when these banks hedge over - the - counter swaps transactions .
This has effectively opened a loophole for unlimited speculation .
When Index Speculators enter into commodity index swaps , which 85 - 90 % of them do , they face no speculative position limits ....
The result is a gross distortion in data that effectively hides the full impact of Index Speculation . "
( Thanks to Mish 's Global Economic Trend Analysis ; the one " indispensable " financial blog on the Internet ) Masters adds that the CFTC is pressing to make " Index Speculators exempt from all position limits " so they can make " unlimited " bets on the futures which are wreaking havoc on the global economy and pushing millions towards starvation .
Of course , these things pale in comparison to the higher priority of fatting the bottom line of the parasitic investor class .
Brimming oil tankers are presently sitting off the coasts of Iran and Louisiana .
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been filled .
Demand is flat .
The world 's biggest consumer of energy ( guess who ? ) is cutting back .
As CNN reports : " At a time when gas prices are at an all - time high , Americans have curtailed their driving at a historic rate .
The Department of Transportation said figures from March show the steepest decrease in driving ever recorded .
Compared with March a year earlier , Americans drove an estimated 4.3 percent less -- that 's 11 billion fewer miles , the DOT 's Federal Highway Administration said Monday , calling it " the sharpest yearly drop for any month in FHWA history . "
( CNN )
The great oil crunch is another fabricated crisis ; another " smoke and mirrors " fiasco ; another Enron - type shell - game engineered by banksters and hedge fund managers .
Once again , the bloody footprints can be traced right back to the front door of the Federal Reserve .
Do n't expect help from the regulators either ; they 've all been replaced with business reps like Harvey Pitt or Hank Paulson .
The only time anyone in the Bush administration finds their conscience is when they 're offered a multi-million dollar " tell all " book deal .
Can you hear me , Scotty ?

The bandit pulled his truck to the back of a Burger King in Northern California one afternoon last month armed with a hose and a tank .
After rummaging around assorted restaurant rubbish , he dunked a tube into a smelly storage bin and , the police said , vacuumed out about 300 gallons of grease .
The man was caught before he could slip away .
In his truck , the police found 2,500 gallons of used fryer grease , indicating that the Burger King had not been his first fast - food craving of the day .
Outside Seattle , cooking oil rustling has become such a problem that the owners of the Olympia Pizza and Pasta Restaurant in Arlington , Wash . , are considering using a surveillance camera to keep watch on its 50 - gallon grease barrel .
Nick Damianidis , an owner , said the barrel had been hit seven or eight times since last summer by siphoners who strike in the night .
“ Fryer grease has become gold , ” Mr. Damianidis said .
“ And just over a year ago , I had to pay someone to take it away . ”
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Oil prices will climb to $ 170 a barrel this year because of increased demand , political tension and decisions made by monetary policymakers in the U.S. and Europe that have devalued the U.S. dollar , OPEC President Chakib Khelil told Bloomberg News on Saturday .
" Oil prices are expected to reach $ 170 as demand for fuel is growing in the U.S. during the summer period and the dollar continues to weaken against the euro , " Khelil , leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , said , according to the news service .
Political pressure on Iran and the depreciation of the U.S. currency have caused a surge in oil prices , Khelil explained .
Crude prices hit a record $ 142.99 a barrel on Friday in New York trading .
See full story .
That 's sparked debate about whether a lack of new supply , rising demand or speculation is driving prices ever higher .
OPEC argues that supplies are sufficient , a message Khelil repeated on Saturday .
" There is more than enough oil in the market to meet the international demand , " he told Bloomberg .
" The decisions made by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank helped the devaluation of the dollar , which pushed up oil prices , " he explained .
Oil may extend gains if the ECB boosts rates on July 3 , further weakening the U.S. currency , Bloomberg said , noting that the greenback has declined 15 % against the euro in the past year .
The Fed left U.S. interest rates on hold on Wednesday at 2 % , after a series of cuts designed to cushion the impact of the mortgage - fueled credit crunch .

On the same day , European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet said policy makers may increase the main refinancing rate by a quarter - percentage point next month to contain inflation .
The U.S. dollar has dropped against the euro and other currencies in recent weeks on expectations the Fed wo n't raise rates too soon for fear of exacerbating a U.S. economic slowdown .

PHILADELPHIA , April 16 ( Reuters ) - Democratic
White House hopeful Barack Obama on Wednesday disagreed with former President Jimmy Carter 's overtures toward Hamas , saying he would not talk to the Islamist group until it recognized Israel and renounced terrorism .
The Illinois senator , campaigning in Pennsylvania which holds the next presidential voting contest on Tuesday , told a group of Jewish leaders he has an " unshakable commitment " to help protect Israel from its " bitter enemies . "
" That 's why I have a fundamental difference with President Carter and disagree with his decision to meet with Hamas , " Obama said .
" We must not negotiate with a terrorist group intent on Israel 's destruction .
We should only sit down with Hamas if they renounce terrorism , recognize Israel 's right to exist and abide by past agreements . "
" Hamas is not a state .
Hamas is a terrorist organization , " he said .
Obama 's opponents have criticized him for saying as president he would be willing to meet with foreign leaders who are hostile to the Unites States .
Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican John McCain have called those comments naive and said such meetings would bestow credibility on those leaders .
Obama and New York Sen. Clinton are waging a tight battle for the Democratic nomination to face Arizona Sen. McCain in the November election .
Obama leads in pledged delegates who will pick that nominee but the final decision may come down to party officials and dignitaries called superdelegates .
Carter , 83 , is one of those superdelegates who can vote for anyone and has not said who he supports , but has hinted he favors Obama .
During his one term as U.S. president from 1977 to 1981 , Carter brokered Israel 's 1979 peace treaty with Egypt .
The 2002 Nobel Peace Prize winner is visiting the Middle East and has angered Israeli leaders by meeting with Hamas officials and making plans to meet the group 's top leader , Khaled Meshaal , in Syria .
Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip by force in June and has rejected Western demands to recognize Israel , renounce violence and accept existing Israeli - Palestinian interim peace deals .
The Bush administration also opposes Carter 's planned meeting with Meshaal .
Obama said the greatest threat to Israel comes from Iran and said the United States should talk to Iran directly .
" My approach to Iran will be based upon aggressive diplomacy , " he said .
" What it means is that we come to the table with a very clear set of objectives and a very clear set of demands -- that Iran ceases from pursuing nuclear weapons , that it stops funding Hezbollah and Hamas , that it ends its noxious statements about Israel and the threats directed towards Israel , " he said .
" The current policy of not talking is not working and I believe its time to change that , " he said .

Raja has been trained not to bite A group of divers stranded on a remote island had to fight off a " man-eating " Komodo dragon .
How dangerous are these creatures really ?
When three Britons were washed up on a remote Indonesian island , their relief must have been immense .
For 12 hours they and two other divers had been clinging to each other in shark - infested waters after being carried from their diving boat by currents .
But wracked by dehydration and exhaustion , their joy at reaching Rinca island was short - lived when a Komodo dragon appeared on the beach .
They pelted it with rocks and it retreated , and the five divers were later rescued .
Komodo dragons are known to have killed and eaten humans .
So how dangerous are are they ?
Dr Ian Stephen is assistant curator of herpetology ( reptiles and amphibians ) at London Zoo , where he looks after two Komodo dragons .
Raja is an adult male , 10 years old , and Raja 's daughter Sayang is nearly two .
Potentially they are very dangerous animals , he says , but it helped that the divers stayed on the beach .
THE ANSWER
In the wild they are very dangerous and would attack humans unprovoked
They bite their prey and their saliva has 80 strains of bacteria
They then wait two days for it to die and feast as a group on the kill " They will eat anything that washes up on the beach .
That 's why these people would have been in danger .
When you have animals on the brink of starvation they will be very aggressive and humans are not very powerful .
" If you have a couple of people throwing stones or sticks , that can work as long as you are only dealing with one or two [ dragons ] .
They were in danger but they did the right thing .
" They can move incredibly quickly over short distances .
The danger would have been when people started looking for food and headed inland , into long grass . "
A Komodo dragon 's favoured method of attack is to lie in the bushes and long grass and then pounce on their prey , usually deer , feral pigs or water buffalo .
It also eats carrion .

Pound for pound they are incredibly powerful , says Dr Stephen , the largest lizard in the world measuring up to three metres long ( 9ft 10ins ) and 120kg ( 265 lbs ) .
And they are strong swimmers so could follow a fleeing human into the sea .
" Generally they attack their prey but do n't kill it there and then .
They have a poisonous saliva full of different bacteria , about 80 species of bacteria .
So in a couple of days septicaemia sets in and the prey dies . "
Contrary to some reports they do not spit venom , he says , but their teeth are shark - like and leave a very nasty and poisonous bite .
If the wounded prey gets away the dragon can follow a blood trail a couple of miles away .
KOMODO DRAGON
World 's largest lizard , up to 3.1 m and 126kg Capable of ' virgin births ' without a male Numbers estimated at 4,000 on four Indonesian islands
In captivity there is an acute shortage of females Nicknamed ' buaya darat ' or land crocodile A kill usually attracts many dragons who feed according to their own hierarchy .
Humans living on the islands within the national park habitat of the dragons have learnt how to adapt to the dangers .
Their houses are on stilts .
Although attacks on humans are rare , an eight - year - old German boy was mauled to death there in 2007 .
Dr Stephen says a Komodo dragon in the wild would not hesitate to kill and eat a human if they wanted to , but Raja has been trained and is quite tame .
He is fed deer , rabbits or wild boar every four to eight weeks .
He eats the whole prey - skin , bone and hair .
Sometimes he regurgitates some of the bones .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
He seems to enjoy human interaction , especially being stroked , but there are occasional , sharp reminders of his strength .
" When Raja has a blood test , it takes two men to restrain his tail .
You can't imagine the power in this animal and he 's only 54kg .
Imagine one that was 120kg . "
In the wild , the tail is used as defence or to compete with other dragons for the meat of a big kill .
Fortunately , the dragons on Rinca island were denied a human meal at the weekend .

WASHINGTON –
In recent months there have been secret contacts between the Iranian government and the leadership of al - Qaeda , top officials in the White House , the Pentagon and the intelligence community said Thursday .
Iranian Threat US : Strong reasons to suspect Iran was working covertly to build atomic bomb AFP Western diplomat says IAEA ' alarmed ' that Islamic Republic in possession of document describing process of machining uranium metal into two hemispheres of the kind used in nuclear warheads .
Iran 's ambassador to UN atomic watchdog says intelligence ' lousy , fake '
US : Strong reasons to suspect Iran was working covertly to build atomic bomb
Iran will allow these operatives to go free , but said they do n't know Iran 's motivation for initiating the talks .
" Iran likely sees these individuals as major bargaining chips , " one official said .
" How and when they 're going to use those chips or whether they are going to keep them in the bank is part of an ongoing strategic discussion they are having internally . "
Shortly after the US invaded Afghanistan in late 2001 , al - Qaeda 's central leadership broke into two groups .
US intelligence believes that one group , headed by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri , fled to the east to find safe haven in Pakistan 's tribal areas .
The second group went west to Iran , and intelligence analysts postulate that this group includes al - Qaeda 's management council , or " shura , " which numbers about two dozen militants , including Adel , al - Qaeda spokesman Suliman abu Ghaith and some of Bin Laden 's relatives , including two of his sons , Saad and Hamza .
These militants are considered to be among the most dangerous terrorists in the world .
Adel is on the FBI list of Most Wanted Terrorists and is a suspect in the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
The State Department has put a $ 5 million bounty on his head .
Iranian authorities detained these militants in 2003 , and they have been under what one US official called " loose house arrest " in Iran ever since .
The US government quietly sent messages to Iran through the Swiss government , requesting that the al - Qaeda figures be turned over to their native countries for interrogation and trial .
Iran has refused .
" Al - Qaeda would like to get those folks a deal and they 've been trying to work a deal , " a senior defense official told ABC News .
US intelligence analysts have several theories as to why al - Qaeda and Tehran have recently renewed contact .
According to one theory , Iran initiated the talks as a threat to the United States ; so that if the US takes hostile action against Iran , these captives could be released , and set free to plot attacks against the West .
As dumbness has been defined downward in American public life during the last two decades , one of the most important and frequently overlooked culprits is the public ’s increasing reluctance to give a fair hearing -- or any hearing at all -- to opposing points of view .
A few years ago , I delivered a lecture at Eastern Kentucky University on the history of American secularism , and was pleased , in the heart of the Bible Belt , to have attracted an audience of about 150 .
The response inside the hall was enthusiastic because everyone there , with the exception of a few bored students whose professors had made attendance a requirement , agreed with me before I opened my mouth .
Around the corner , hundreds more students were packing an auditorium to hear a speaker sponsored by the Campus Crusade for Christ , a conservative organization that “ counter - programs ” secular lectures at many colleges .
The star of the evening was a self - described recovering pedophile who claimed to have overcome his proclivities by being “ born again . ”
( And yes , it is a blow to the ego to find oneself less of a draw than a penitent pedophile . )
It is safe to say that almost no one who attended either lecture on the Kentucky campus that night was exposed to a new or disturbing idea .
Indeed , virtually everywhere I speak , 95 % of the audience shares my political and cultural views -- and serious conservatives report exactly the same experience on the lecture circuit .

Whether watching television news , consulting political blogs or ( more rarely ) reading books , Americans today have become a people in search of validation for opinions that they already hold .
This absence of curiosity about other points of view is the essence of anti-intellectualism and represents a major departure from the nation ’s best cultural traditions .
In the last quarter of the 19th century , Americans jammed lecture halls to hear Robert Green Ingersoll , known as “ the Great Agnostic , ” attack organized religion and question the existence of God .
They did so not because they necessarily agreed with him but because they wanted to make up their own minds about what he had to say and see for themselves whether the devil really had horns .
Similarly , when Thomas Henry Huxley , the British naturalist who popularized Darwin ’s theory of evolution , came to the U.S. in 1876 , he spoke to standing - room - only audiences , even though many of his listeners were genuinely shocked by his views .
This spirit of inquiry , which demands firsthand evidence and does not trivialize opposing points of view , is essential to a society ’s intellectual and political health .

Richard Hofstadter , in his classic 1963 work , “ Anti-Intellectualism in American Life , ” argued that among “ the major virtues of liberal society in the past was that it made possible such a variety of styles of intellectual life -- one can find men notable for being passionate and rebellious , for being elegant and sumptuous , or spare and astringent , clever and complex , patient and wise , and some equipped mainly to observe and endure .
...
It is possible , of course , that the avenues of choice are being closed and that the culture of the future will be dominated by single - minded men of one persuasion or another .
It is possible ; but insofar as the weight of one ’s will is thrown onto the scales of history , one lives in the belief that it not be so . ”
Hofstadter was of course using the word “ liberal ” with a small “ l , ” in the sense that the term had been used in the past -- as a synonym for open - mindedness and concern for liberty of thought instead of as the right - wing political epithet it has become during the last 25 years .
When I recently spoke about the militant parochialism of American intellectual life on a radio talk show , a caller responded by telling me that there was nothing new about Americans preferring to bask in the reflected glow of their own opinions .
Talk radio and political blogs , in his view , are merely the modern equivalent of friends -- and have n’t we always chosen friends who agree with us ?
Well , no .
Tell it to John Adams and Thomas Jefferson , who certainly had many , often bitter disagreements about politics and whose correspondence nevertheless leaps off the page as an example of the illumination to be derived from exchanges of ideas between friends who respect each other even though they do not always share the same opinions .
Advertisement
“ You and I ought not to die , before we have explained ourselves to each other , ” Adams wrote Jefferson in 1815 .
It is doubtful that today ’s politicians will spend much time trying to explain themselves to one another even after they leave office .
They are , after all , creatures of a culture in which it is acceptable , on the Senate floor , for Vice President Dick Cheney to tell Vermont ’s Democratic Sen.
Patrick Leahy to “ go [ obscene verb ] yourself ”
--
There is a direct connection between the debasement of political discourse and the public ’s tendency to tune out any voice that is not an echo .
“ Swift boating ” can succeed in politics only because of the correct assumption that huge numbers of Americans lack the broad knowledge that would enable them to spot blatantly unfair attacks .
If Barack Obama is the Democratic nominee , we will surely hear , from the slimier corners of the blogosphere , a renewal of the lie that he is a Muslim .
John McCain got the same treatment from George W. Bush supporters in the 2000 campaign , when the rumor that his adopted child from Bangladesh was really his own illegitimate African American baby cost him votes in the Republican primary in South Carolina .
Voters of any political persuasion who watch only cable news shows or consult only blogs that support their preconceptions are patsies for these kinds of lies .

Ironically , the unprecedented array of choices , on hundreds of cable channels and the Web , have contributed to the decline of common knowledge and the denigration of fairness by both the right and the left .
No one but a news junkie has the time or the inclination to spend the entire day consulting diverse news sources on the Web , and the temptation to seek out commentary that fits neatly into one ’s worldview -- whether that means the Huffington Post or the Drudge Report -- is hard to resist .
Genuine fairness does not mean the kind of bogus objectivity that always locates truth equidistant from two points , but it does demand that divergent views be understood and taken into account in approaching public issues .
In re-reading Hofstadter several years ago , I was struck by the fairness of his scholarship , a serious , old - fashioned attempt to engage the arguments of his opponents and to acknowledge evidence that ran counter to his own biases .
I had not noticed that when I read the book for the first time in the 1960s because fairness was , to a considerable degree , taken for granted in those days as an ideal for aspiring young scholars and writers .
A vast public laziness feeds the media ’s predilection today to distill news through polemicists of one stripe or another and to condense complex information into meaningless sound bites .
On April 8 , for example , Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , commander of the U.S. armed forces in Iraq , testified before the Senate in hearings that lasted into the early evening .
Although the hearings were on cable during the day , the networks offered no special programming in the evening , and newscasts were content with sound bites of McCain , Obama and Hillary Clinton questioning the general .
Dueling presidential candidates were the whole story .
Absent from most news reports was testimony concerning the administration ’s ongoing efforts to forge agreements with various Iraqi factions without submitting the terms to Congress for ratification -- a development with constitutional implications as potentially serious as the Watergate affair .
No matter .
Anyone who wanted to hear Petraeus bashed or applauded could turn to his or her preferred political cable show or click on a blog to find an unchallenging interpretation of the day ’s events .
Advertisement
The tepid interest in the substance of Petraeus ’ testimony on the part of the public and much of the media contrasts sharply with the response to the Senate Watergate hearings in 1973 .
All 319 hours of the first round of the hearings were televised , and 85 % of Americans tuned in to at least some of the proceedings live .
I remember those weeks as a period when everyday preoccupations faded into the background and we found time , as a people , to perform our civic duty .
An ongoing war may lack the drama of Watergate , but it is doubtful that anything short of another terrorist attack on our soil would convince today ’s public that it ought to read the transcript of a lengthy congressional hearing or pay attention , for more than five minutes , to live news as it unfolds .
It is past time for Americans to stop attributing the polarization of our public life to the media , the demon entity “ Washington ” or “ the elites . ”
As long as we continue to avoid the hard work of scrutinizing public affairs without the filter of polemical shouting heads , we have no one to blame for the governing class and its policies but ourselves .
Like Hofstadter , I yearn to live in a society that values fair - mindedness .
But it will take nothing less than a revolutionary public recommitment to the pursuit of fairness , knowledge and memory to halt , much less reverse , the trend toward an ignorant single - mindedness that threatens the future of democracy itself .
How to travel the world for free ( seriously )
WORLD TRAVEL is cheap and easy .
In fact , with a little practice and effort , you can travel for free .
The idea that travel is expensive and difficult is bullshit peddled by tour companies , hotel chains , and corporate media .
The tourism industry wants you to buy cruise packages and stay at all - inclusive resorts .
They want you to choose a world travel experience the same way you would choose a new jacket at the mall .
They want your credit card number .
The tourism industry does n’t want me to reveal the simple secrets of free travel , but I ’m going to share them with you anyway .
It can be scary to travel the world with nothing more than optimism and good - will , but personal freedom begins with a leap of faith .
1. Embrace the simple joy of travel .
Travel frees you from the grind of daily routine .
You will explore new places , meet new people , try new foods , and learn things about the world — and yourself — that you never imagined were possible .
The joy of new experience is the most wonderful thing about world travel — and new experiences are free .
Walk the streets of a city .
Stop and chat with a local .
People watch in a public park .
Climb to the top of a hill and watch the sun set over the ocean .
The simple joy of being in a new place is just a matter of …wait for it …going someplace new .
No tour package required .
2. Keep your needs to a minimum .
The modern American economy is built on the false premise that people need to buy new goods and services all the time .
Again , I call bullshit .
People need fresh air , healthy food , clean water , exercise , creative stimulation , companionship , self - esteem , and a safe place to sleep .
All of these things are simple to obtain .
Most of them are free .
For fresh air , go outside .
For exercise , take a walk .
For creative stimulation , go somewhere new .
For companionship , make a friend .
For self - esteem , turn off your TV , breathe deep , and open your spirit to the basic goodness of the world .
Things like food and shelter are much cheaper once you get outside the United States .
See # 5 below for ways to obtain food and shelter for free .
3 . Go slow .
If you live in New York and want to take a 2 - week vacation to Africa , it will be very difficult ( though not impossible , see # 8 ) to travel for free .
Indeed , as long as you believe that time is money , you will spend money all the time .
Time is not money .
Time is free .
You have all the time in the world .
Instead of buying a plane ticket , catch a ride out West , or remodel an old sailboat , or just hop on your bike and ride away from town .
The slower you travel , the less money you will spend .
4. Leave your possessions and obsessions behind .
When you travel , you do n’t need to pay rent .
You do n’t need a car .
You do n’t need an oven , a washer - dryer , electricity , cable TV , a gym membership , a sofa and loveseat , or a closet full of clothes .
You do n’t need a suit and tie to wear to your job because you do n’t need a job .
You do n’t need to worry about paying the bills , because there are no bills to pay .
You are free .
5 . Trust people and you will receive free food and lodging .
Many people are willing to open their homes to travelers .
Chip in with a few chores , and they will give you a free meal , too .
CouchSurfing and WWOOF are two phenomenal online networks that help travelers connect with local hosts .
CouchSurfing members are willing to give travelers a place to sleep for a night or two .
WWOOF connects travelers with organic farmers who want to trade room and board for an extra hand .
Many members of both CouchSurfing and WWOOF are seeking an alternative to high - impact consumer culture .
6. Learn a useful craft or skill .
If you have a skill , such as cooking , animal husbandry , massage , musical ability , or basic carpentry , you can barter for free food and accommodation as you travel the world .
Universally appreciated skills like cooking are best , though niche skills that are in high demand , like website design , are also useful .
Native English speakers can often travel for free by teaching language classes in each destination they visit .
The slower you travel , the easier it will be to work out a mutually beneficial arrangement with a local community or host .
7 . Get out of the city .
Although it ’s possible to travel for free in a big city , it ’s damn difficult .
Cities are built on money , and necessities like fresh air , clean water , and a safe place to sleep are difficult to come by in cities .
Go to the country , where people are more relaxed , food is plentiful , and there ’s ample room for one traveler to lay out her sleeping bag under the stars .
8 . Find a job you love that entails world travel .
If you need an income in order to pay off loans or support a child , find a job that calls for extensive travel .
There are millions of jobs available in the global economy that demand world travel .
Of course , some jobs are easier to love than others , and much work that involves travel also involves the destruction of local ecosystems and traditional ways of life .
Avoid unethical work if at all possible — it ’s bad for your health and worse for your soul .
For job ideas , check out 20 + awesome travel jobs and how to get them .
9. Embrace serendipity .
To travel for free requires a blend of advance planning and the willingness to seize opportunities and go with the flow .
Does your new CouchSurfing friend want company for a drive across the country ?
Grab your pack and ride along !
Does an organic farm in Thailand need a farm sitter for the rainy season ?

As Kurt Vonnegut wrote , “ Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God . ”

Before the first Olympic torch demonstrators began lining the Embarcadero on Wednesday , there was a last - minute , high - tension showdown between San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsomand Chinese officials that could have killed the torch relay even before it started .
At issue was the Chinese government 's insistence that 12 paramilitary " flame attendants " be allowed to accompany the runners through the streets of San Francisco .
The diplomatic back - and - forth over the Chinese torch detail began months ago with what appeared to be a benign request from Beijing to have attendants on hand to manage the Olympic flame and torches .
City officials were told the attendants were needed to carry the keys to turn the torches on and off as the flame was passed from runner to runner .
" We thought they were talking about some youth or civic volunteer group - then we found out they were actually ninja - style paramilitary police , " said one City Hall source who was in on the talks , but asked not to be named because of the diplomatic sensitivity over the dustup .
San Francisco wanted to allow just two attendants on the run but settled for six .
" After setting clear ground rules about what they would and would n't do , we decided we would live with it , " Police Chief Heather Fong said .
Then came the disrupted torch run through Istanbul and a photo of at least one of the attendants in a blue - and - white jogging outfit not just protecting the torch , but going after someone in the crowd .
After the London torch run also was plagued by protesters , Fong called her counterparts in Britain to get the lowdown on just how the attendants worked .
She was not happy with what she heard .
According to London police , the Chinese attendants did not appear to speak English , so it was impossible for the cops to talk to them .
Instead , the attendants , who all wore earpieces , took their orders from Zhang Ming , a Chinese Olympic official who accompanied the run in a car .
She would order changes in the speed of the relay or bring it to a halt , even when London police wanted to move .
The mayor and Fong decided to draw the line back to two attendants .
But once the torch delegation touched down at San Francisco International , the Chinese cited the disruptions at the relay 's earlier stops and renewed their request for the full 12 attendants .
Fong and Newsom stood fast .
The result was a long , tense meeting the night before the run with the Chinese ambassador to the United States , the vice chairman of the Beijing Olympic Committee ( who apparently outranked the ambassador ) , and Newsom , Fong and their staffs .
After hours of back and forth , and assurances that the lost manpower would be made up by State Department and other law - enforcement officers , the Chinese relented and the remaining attendants stayed on the bus .
Chances are people would n't have noticed the attendants had not Majora Carter , one of the torchbearers , pulled a Tibetan flag out during her run .
One of the attendants quickly pulled her out of the run and handed her off to the San Francisco cops , who in turn pushed her into the crowd of spectators lining the route .
Prize fight :
No sooner did the curtain drop on San Francisco 's Olympic torch run controversy than the city became the backdrop for another global flareup , this time involving homegrown Chevron Corp . and the eco-politics of oil drilling in the Amazon .
It 's all being ignited by San Francisco 's Goldman Foundation 's announcement today that the organization is awarding one of its prestigious environmental prizes this year to Pablo Fajardo and his associate Luis Yanza .
Fajardo is a former Ecuadoran farm laborer who rose to take over as a lead attorney in a nearly 2 - decade - old fight to force Chevron - acquired Texaco Inc. to pay billions of dollars to clean up 1,700 square miles of rain forest polluted by years of drilling and the dumping of oily wastewater .
Yanza is a fellow community leader in the cause .
Once San Ramon's Chevron got wind of the Goldman Foundation selections , the oil giant began gearing up for a full - scale media counterattack charging that the charity founded by philanthropist and former San Francisco Protocol Director Richard Goldman had been " sadly misled " in honoring the Ecuadoran pair .
Chevron says most of the pollution has happened under Ecuador 's own government - run oil company , which took over drilling in 1990 .
Chevron enlisted high - priced San Francisco PR crisis manager Sam Singer to push its assertion that the company is the victim of trumped - up charges and greedy lawyers .
On Friday , it sent a letter to Goldman accusing Fajardo and his supporters of being " dishonest and duplicitous in their campaign " against Chevron .
On Tuesday , Chevron plans to roll out a full - page ad in The Chronicle - the start of a nationwide campaign that will also feature ads in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal .
While much of the legal fight drags on in Ecuador , Chevron has prevailed in U.S. courts .
In November , a federal judge in San Francisco tossed the remaining health claims from the case against Chevron , citing a two - year statute of limitations .
The court even went so far as to levy sanctions and fines against Fajardo 's fellow lawyers in the case for presenting fabricated cancer claims .
None of which seems to have kept Fajardo from becoming a cause celebre .
He and his movement have drawn attention from the likes of Bianca Jagger , and Fajardo was even the subject of a glossy profile last year in Vanity Fair .
And now the announcement that he and Yanza will split a $ 150,000 Goldman Environmental Prize .
For his part , Goldman says honoring the pair has nothing to do directly with the merits of the lawsuit .
" These fellows are being honored because they are trying to protect the land where their ancestors lived and they live , " Goldman told us Friday .
As for Chevron 's contention that it 's been scapegoated in the process , Goldman said , " If you had a bunch of stockholders out there , what would you say ? "

' Frog from hell ' fossil hints at later split of continents .
Beelzebufo ( left ) was 2 - 3 times bigger than the largest living South American frog in this family ( top right ) , and 4 - 5 times bigger than the largest living Malagasy frog ( bottom right ) .
PNAS
A giant frog that hopped around Madagascar 65 – 70 million years ago has been discovered .
Fossil fragments show that the frog , called Beelzebufo ampinga , could have measured 20 centimetres across its squat head , and probably more than 40 centimetres from snout to tail .
The researchers nicknamed the monstrous beast ‘ the frog from hell ’ ; the official name comes from one of the many names for the devil ( Beelzebub ) and the Latin for ' toad ' ( bufo ) .
Strangely , the frog looks to be more similar to a subfamily of amphibians called the Ceratophryinae , thought to be endemic to South America , than to any of the hundreds of frog species of present - day Madagascar .
It is thought that the supercontinent called Gondwana , made up of Antarctica , South America , Africa , Madagascar , the Indian subcontinent , and Australia and New Zealand , began to split apart some 160 million years ago .
But the Beelzebufo fossils support the controversial notion that parts of the supercontinent stayed together until much later than that , says Susan Evans , a vertebrate morphologist and palaeontologist at University College London , UK .
Evans suspects that Beelzebufo and current day Ceratophryinae in South America had a common Gondwanan ancestor that began to diversify before 70 million years ago , and that Madagascar - India was linked by land to South America via Antarctica as recently as 80 million years ago , in the Late Cretaceous period .
Evans and her colleagues report the find in this week ’s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1 .
Puzzle pieces
Artist 's impression of the ' frog from hell ' .
Stony Brook University
Evans and her colleagues studied more than 60 frog fossil fragments collected in the Mahajanga Basin in Madagascar .
The team could n’t piece together a complete skeleton , but did get a nearly complete picture of the skull , which was “ short and fat with a huge mouth " , says Evans .
Similarly - shaped South American frogs have a strong bite and can feast on small vertebrate such as mice and lizards : “ Basically , they eat anything smaller that walks by , ” Evans says .
Beelzebufo was 2 - 3 times bigger than Ceratophrys aurita , the largest living South American frog in this family , and 4 - 5 times bigger than the largest living Malagasy frog , Mantidactylus guttulatus .
Stuck together
Evans says that when she first began to suspect the Madagascar fragments came from a frog related to South American Ceratophryinae , she was very cautious about the claim .
“ We knew it would be controversial , ” she says .
“ There are people who believe everything on Madagascar today must have been there when it broke with Gondwana 160 million years ago . ”
Blair Hedges , a biologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park , agrees that Beelzebufo is an important find .
“ The new fossil frog , besides being large and odd - shaped , is quite unexpected because of its apparent relationship with South American species , ” he says .
ADVERTISEMENT
But he says he is n’t yet convinced that the new find is related to the South American frogs .
Molecular clock data suggests that these frogs split from a common ancestor more recently than 66 million years ago , he says .
" Based on molecular evidence of frog relationships , the specific resemblance to some living wide - mouthed frogs is more likely from [ evolutionary ] convergence than actual relationship . "
Convergent evolution , where unrelated species occupying similar niches tend to look the same , is common in frogs , he says .
Even if they are related , he adds , this does n't mean that the frogs necessarily had to walk on land from one location to another before Gondwana split .
“ Any organism , including a frog , can raft on dead vegetation , ” he says .
But Evans is convinced they are related : " It is the same family .
I have no doubt of that , " she says .

Ur -Scheme : A GPL self - hosting compiler from a subset of R5RS Scheme to fast Linux x86 asm
Ur-Scheme is a compiler from a small subset of R5RS Scheme to Intel x86 assembly language for Linux .
It can compile itself .
It is free software , licensed under the GNU GPLv3 +.
It might be useful as a base for a more practical implementation ( or a more compact one ) , or it might be enjoyable to read ( particularly since the entire development history is browsable using darcs ) , but it probably is n't that useful in its current form .
Ur -Scheme is :
Reasonably fast .
It generates reasonably fast code — when compiled with itself , it runs 2 ½ times faster ( in user CPU time ) than when it 's compiled with Chicken , 1 ½ times faster than when it 's compiled with Gambit - C , and much faster than when it 's interpreted by any of Guile , MzScheme , SCM , Elk , or Chicken 's interpreter .
It also runs reasonably fast ; on my laptop , it compiles about 1000 lines of Scheme per user CPU second , which is not fast in absolute terms ( on the same hardware , gas assembles the resulting 66 000 - line assembly file in just over half a second , which is about 100 000 lines of assembly per second ) but seems to be faster than a lot of Scheme compilers .
I imagine that it would run faster if compiled with Ikarus or Stalin , but my CPU is too old to run Ikarus , and I can't get Stalin to compile it successfully .

Impractical .
It hardly implements anything beyond what 's in R5RS , and it omits quite a bit of the stuff that is in R5RS ; for example , files , macros , vectors , eval , quasiquotation , call / cc , and floating - point ( " inexact numbers " ) .
Only things that were needed for the compiler to compile itself and run some unit tests are included .

Small .
The implementation is about 1600 lines of Scheme , plus 700 lines of comments and blank lines .
Compiled with itself on x86 Linux and stripped , the executable is 134 kiB .
On my 700MHz laptop from the previous millennium , compiling it from scratch with MzScheme and gas takes just under 12 seconds .

Safe .
Programs compiled with it do not crash or corrupt their memory unless there is a bug in the compiler ( er , except if they run out of stack or heap ) .
All types and array indices are dynamically checked at run-time .

Portable .
Last time I checked , it could compile itself successfully when compiled by Guile , MzScheme ( PLT Scheme ) , SCM , Elk , Gambit - C , or Chicken , although it does n't run in Bigloo , Stalin , RScheme , or TinyScheme .
Retargeting it to a different processor would n't be a huge pain ( after all , it 's only 1600 lines of code ) but would n't be that trivial either .

Unit - tested .
It comes with a fairly comprehensive set of unit tests , and additionally , it compiles itself well enough that the compiled version produces the same assembly - language output , byte - for - byte , as when it 's running interpreted in some other Scheme — at least when it 's compiling itself .
Downloading
If you want to get it , even though it 's impractical , you can use Darcs to snarf the source repository :
darcs get http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/urscheme/
Or you can download the source tarball of Ur - Scheme version 3 , or version 2 , version 1 , or version 0 if you like .
On Linux , if you have MzScheme , GCC , and gas installed , you can build it by just typing " make " .
So far there it only runs on Linux , although it looks like a MacOS port would be pretty easy .
Limitations
The following are missing : user - defined macros , eval , quasiquotation , first - class continuations , vectors , numerical constants with radix prefixes , ports , " let * " , " letrec " , non - top - level defines ( " internal definitions " ) , " do " , promises , non-integer numbers , bignums , load , apply , case - insensitivity , multiple - value returns .
Pairs are immutable , so there are no set - car !
and set -cdr !.
Despite this , eqv? is not the same as equal ? for lists .
Procedures are allowed to take fixed numbers of arguments , or any arbitrary number of arguments , but the normal at - least - N syntax ( lambda ( a b . rest ) ... ) is not supported .
Rebinding standard procedures may break your program .
However , some standard procedures are treated as special forms by the compiler , so rebinding them will rarely have any effect .
Integer arithmetic silently overflows .
Most arithmetic operators are omitted ; only 1+ , 1 - , + , - , quotient , and remainder are present .
Very many standard library procedures are missing .
Only the following 55 procedures were actually present last time I updated this list : procedure ?
string ?
make - string string - set !
string - ref string - length car cdr cons pair ?
symbol ?
symbol -> string string -> symbol display newline eq ?
current - input - port read - char integer ?
remainder quotient < eof - object ?
char ?
integer -> char char -> integer list length assq memq memv append not string - append char - whitespace ?
char <?
char<=?
char - between ?
char-alphabetic ?
= char= ? eqv? equal ? string= ?
null ?
boolean ?
number ?
for - each map reverse string -> list list -> string number -> string string -> number write .
. make - string only takes one argument .
read - char takes a port argument and ignores it ; write , display , and newline do not take port arguments .
current - input - port returns nil .
map and for - each only take two arguments .
number -> string only takes one argument .
string -> symbol will be slow with enough symbols .
Extensions
These are not in R5RS .
( display - stderr foo ) is like display , but uses stderr .
( exit 37 ) makes the program exit with exit code 37 .
( error foo bar baz ) aborts the program and sends to stderr " error : " followed by foo , bar , and baz .
1+ and 1 - are as in Common Lisp .
( char -> string c ) is like ( make - string 1 c ) .
( escape string ) returns a list of character strings which , when concatenated , form a string representing the original string by escaping all the backslashes , quotes , or newlines in the string by preceding them with a backslash .
#\tab is the tab character .
I would n't think to mention it but apparently Stalin does n't support this .
Bugs
Output is unbuffered , which accounts for a third of its run-time .
I still do n't have a garbage collector , and programs crash when they run out of memory .
Influences and Inspirations
Abdulaziz Ghuloum 's paper , An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction , was an enjoyable read and inspirational .
Ghuloum explained his objective and approach thus :
Compilers are perceived to be magical artifacts , carefully crafted by the wizards , and unfathomable by the mere mortals ...
Real - life compilers are too complex to serve as an educational tool .
And the gap between real - life compilers and the educational toy compilers is too wide .
The novice compiler writer stands puzzled facing an impenetrable barrier , " better write an interpreter instead . "
The goal of this paper is to break that barrier .
We show that building a compiler can be as easy as building an interpreter .
The compiler we construct accepts a large subset of the Scheme programming language and produces assembly code for the Intel - x86 architecture ...
The development of the compiler is broken into many small incremental steps .
Every step yields a fully working compiler for a progressively expanding subset of Scheme .
Every compiler step produces real assembly code that can be assembled then executed directly by the hardware .
...
Compiler construction is not as complex as it is commonly perceived to be .
In this paper , we showed that constructing a compiler for a large subset of Scheme that targets a real hardware is simple .
The basic compiler is achieved by concentrating on the essential aspects of compilation and freeing the compiler from sophisticated analysis and optimization passes .
This helps the novice compiler writers build the intuition for the inner-workings of compilers without being distracted by details .
This is the objective and approach with which I started out Ur - Scheme , and it turned out to be extremely successful .
Marc Feeley 's 2004 talk on the " 90 minute Scheme to C compiler " was also quite inspirational , although I did n't use any of the techniques he discussed !
It was useful to see that a relatively complete Scheme compiler could be written in 800 lines of Scheme , and that the performance of the resulting C code was n't too terrible .
In the realm of small self - hosting compilers , Fabrice Bellard 's 2002 OTCC is near the pinnacle of compactness .
In 4748 bytes of code , otccelf compiles the subset of C it is written in into standalone x86 ELF executables .
What 's even more stunning is that the original otcc , missing the ELF output , is only 3301 bytes , and Bellard explains that he actually started with a smaller subset of C than that !
The extended version , TCC , was up to 100 KiB and could compile a Linux kernel from scratch in 10 seconds .
Looking at disassembled code from Bernd Paysan 's bigFORTH showed me that a code generator could be really very simple .
( The bigFORTH web page says , " The compiler generates optimized native code for the i386 . " , but I do n't know what meaning of " optimized " Bernd has in mind . )
bigFORTH gets pretty decent performance in my experience , really , much better than the gFORTH threaded - code interpreter .
But it looks like most of the bigFORTH primitives simply inline fixed instruction sequences , and no register allocation is done .
I figured I could glue together fixed instruction sequences too .
Once I got started , I learned about Darius Bacon 's brilliant seven - page self - hosting " ichbins " compiler and read it .
It 's definitely worth a read .
I decided to call it " Ur - Scheme " because it 's not quite a Scheme , with all the missing parts mentioned above ; it 's more like something that could grow into a Scheme .
I was inspired by UrJTAG , but of course the echo of " Ur- Quan Masters " ( one of my favorite games ) was a plus as well .
Also , the ancient capital of Sumer was Ur of the Chaldees ( אור כשדים in Hebrew ) , and it's an Unoriginal Reimplementation of Scheme .
( Thanks to Ben Goetter for that . )
Or at least some of it .
Origins and Lessons
In February 2008 , I wanted to write a metacompiler for Bicicleta , but I was intimidated because I 'd never written a compiler before , and nobody had ever written a compiler either in Bicicleta or for Bicicleta .
So I thought I 'd pick a language that other people knew a lot about writing compilers for and that was n't too hairy , write a compiler for it , and then use what I 'd learned to write the Bicicleta compiler .
It took me about 18 days from the time I started on the project to the time that the compiler could actually compile itself , which was a lot longer than I expected .
I learned a bunch from doing it .
Here are some of the main things I learned :
Interpreters are a better way to bootstrap than metacompilers .
Instead of writing a compiler for a subset of Scheme in that subset , I should have written an interpreter in standard Scheme ( or whatever ) and a metacompiler in the language implemented by the interpreter .
( This is what Darius Bacon did with " ichbins " . )
Interpreters are a lot simpler than compilers , especially if they do n't have to run fast , and especially if you can write them in a language like Scheme that gives you garbage collection and closures for free .
The restriction that the compiler had to be correct both in R5RS Scheme and in the language that it could compile was really a pain .
For example , although I could add new syntactic forms to the language that it could compile , and I could add new syntactic forms with R5RS macro definitions , I could n't simplify the compiler by adding new syntactic forms , because the compiler can't compile R5RS macro definitions .
( There 's a portable implementation of R5RS macros out there , but it 's about twice the size of the entire Ur - Scheme compiler . )
Similarly , I was stuck with a bunch of the boneheaded design decisions of the Scheme built - in types — for example , no auto - growing mutable containers , separate types for strings and characters , and the difficulty of doing any string processing without arithmetic and side effects .
Start with the simplest thing that could possibly work .
I keep on learning this every year .
In this case , the really expensive thing was that I wanted normal function calls to be fast , so I used normal C - style stack frames for their arguments .
This seems to have paid off in speed , but it meant I spent four days and about 200 lines of code implementing lexical closures of unlimited extent .
( Really !
According to my change log , from February 13 to February 16 , I basically did n't do anything else except add macros . )
If I 'd just allocated all my call frames on the heap , the result would have been slow , but I would have gotten done a lot sooner .
Tail - recursion makes your code hard to read .
More traditional control structures , such as explicit loops , are both terser and clearer .
This is the largest Scheme program I 've written , so this is my first time really experiencing this .
Look at this code ( discarded in favor of something simpler now , thank goodness ) : ( define ( string - append - 3 length s2 buf idx ) ( if ( = idx ( string - length buf ) ) buf ( begin ( string - set ! buf idx ( string - ref s2 ( - idx length ) ) ) ( string - append - 3 length s2 buf ( 1+ idx ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( string - append - 2 s1 s2 buf idx ) ( if ( = idx ( string - length s1 ) ) ( string - append -3 ( string - length s1 ) s2 buf idx ) ( begin ( string - set ! buf idx ( string - ref s1 idx ) ) ( string - append - 2 s1 s2 buf ( 1+ idx ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( string - append s1 s2 ) ( string - append - 2 s1 s2 ( make - string (+ ( string - length s1 ) ( string - length s 2 ) ) ) 0 ) )
That horrible rat 's nest is my attempt to straightforwardly translate this very straightforward procedural approach , without introducing any forward references : def string_append ( s1 , s2 ) : buf = make_string ( len ( s1 ) + len ( s2 ) ) idx = 0 while idx != len ( s1 ) : buf[idx ] = s1 [ idx ] idx += 1 length = len ( s1 ) while idx != len ( buf ) : buf[idx ] = s2 [ idx - length ] idx += 1 return buf ( You would n't really want to do that in Python — I 'm just explaining what I was thinking . )
Tail - calls are merely " goto with arguments " , which means that they can be implemented very efficiently , and also means that you can easily use them to create unreadable code .
Native - code compilers get OK performance pretty easily .
On the standard stupid Fibonacci microbenchmark , on my laptop , Ur- Scheme outperforms MzScheme 's interpreter by about a factor of 7.6 ( excluding time to compile and assemble ) : ( define ( fib2 n ) ( cond ( (= n 0 ) 1 ) ( (= n 1 ) 1 ) ( else (+ ( fib2 ( 1- n ) ) ( fib2 (- n 2 ) ) ) ) ) ) GCC outperforms Ur - Scheme on that same benchmark by about a factor of 5 .
On larger programs , such as the Ur - Scheme compiler itself , Ur- Scheme only outperforms MzScheme 's interpreter by about a factor of 5 ( rather than 7 or so ) , which ( if you 're keeping track ) means that Scheme code interpreted in MzScheme is somewhere around 25 - 50 times slower than C code compiled with GCC .
The literature about writing compilers is full of hairy techniques like CPS conversion , SSA conversion , higher - order control - flow analysis , type inference , automated theorem proving , partial evaluation , escape analysis , and so on .
Ur - Scheme does n't do any of those things .
( Well , actually , it does do a little bit of escape analysis . )
In fact , Ur - Scheme does n't even do register allocation , and it does full dynamic type checking at run-time .
I imagine that if you wanted to get performance only 2 or 3 or 4 times worse than C compiled with GCC ( which is not exactly a gold standard itself , these days ) then you 'd need to start hauling out the hairy techniques .
But it already beats the pants off all the interpreters I can find , and at least for itself , it generates faster code than the three well - known Scheme compilers I 've tried on it ( mzc , Gambit - C , and Chicken . )
( I suspect that Stalin and Ikarus would do better ... )
Interesting Features
It has a one - level parser , like old versions of Microsoft BASIC ; there 's no separate tokenizer .
I wrote the parser after reading the " ichbins " parser , and there is definitely some influence visible .
It contains relatively little mutation .
Although almost every line of the compiler has " side effects " like outputting lines of assembly code , there are fairly few locations where the compiler 's internal state is mutated .
I count 25 calls to set !
and string - set ! in the 1600 lines of code , including the standard library .
The I/O side effects are similarly centralized — there are three calls to display , no calls to newline , and one call to read - char in the whole code .
When was the last time you saw a 1600 - line C program with only 25 assignment statements ?
To simplify code generation , it follows BigFORTH and colorForth by treating the x86 as a stack machine .
What little optimization it does is done by optimization macros that rewrite certain patterns in the source — for example , ( if ( not a ) b c ) gets rewritten into ( if a c b ) , and ( if ( null ? x ) y z ) is rewritten into a call to a special built - in ( %ifnull x y z ) .
As described in R5RS , these macros also compile the various Scheme control structures ( cond , case , and , and so on ) into more fundamental control structures like if and lambda .
At present , because it compiles one expression at a time , you can interactively type code at it and see the compiled assembly results .
Unfortunately this is n't very much fun because the generated code is so verbose .
Darius discovered this feature .
The assembly code it produces can compile to statically linked , standalone executables because it does n't depend on any external libraries — it just uses the Linux system call interface directly .
They can be relatively small ; a minimal executable is about 17 KiB , because it includes the whole standard library ( not just the parts that are used ) .
Future Work
First , of course , there are the bugs to fix , especially including the absence of a garbage collector .
If this compiler has any merit at all , it is in its small size and comprehensibility .
Darius Bacon 's brilliant 385 - line " ichbins " self - compiling Lisp - to - C compiler is much better at that , being less than one - fifth of the size .
So one direction of evolution is to figure out what can be stripped out of it .
ichbins has no arithmetic , no closures , no separate string or symbol type , and only one side effect .
There 's probably a lot that could be made clearer , as well .
Another direction is to try to improve the speed and size of its output code a bit .
For example :
Lambda - lifting would keep let - expressions from consing storage for all of the arguments of the outer procedure , and if you were slightly more ambitious , you could even optimize away the procedure call entirely .
That would make them a lot smaller , too .
would keep let - expressions from consing storage for all of the arguments of the outer procedure , and if you were slightly more ambitious , you could even optimize away the procedure call entirely .
That would make them a lot smaller , too .
Although it does some inlining now , it could do more .
Also , the existing inlining would benefit from a preliminary scanning pass to see which globals are never mutated and can therefore be inlined safely without breaking Scheme 's semantics .
Such a scan could also remove the type - check , the two fetches , and the computed call instruction , on the vast majority of procedure calls , and the argument - count check in the vast majority of procedure prologues .

Especially conditional expressions could benefit from some more inlining and integration with their parent if ; currently only null ? , eq ? , and not have this special handling .
( Although that covers about half of the conditionals in the compiler . )
The procedure - call - and - return - and - test overhead totals about 18 instructions .
The implementation of case is particularly inefficient because it actually calls memv .

A little bit of peephole optimization usually goes a long way , but I 'm not sure it would in this case ; we could get a little bit of dead - code removal ( e.g. procedure epilogues preceded by an unconditional jump , as in the very common case of a tail call ) and there 's the occasional pop %eax ; push %eax ; movl foo , %eax sequence .
But overall I do n't think there 's much of an advantage yet .

But overall I do n't think there 's much of an advantage yet .
The procedure prologues and epilogues are pretty large , and they could probably be shrunk quite a bit , especially for non-variadic procedures .
It might be possible to arrange the stack frame so that a simple leave ; ret $ 12 sequence , or something similarly simple , could replace the current eleven bytes of crap , at least for non-variadic procedures .
Tail calls are particularly horrific ; here 's a three - argument tail call : 804977f : 50 push %eax 8049780 : a1 20 89 06 08 mov 0x8068920 , %eax 8049785 : 8d 5 c 24 08 lea 0x8 ( %esp ) , %ebx 8049789 : 8b 55 fc mov 0xfffffffc( %ebp ) , %edx 804978 c : 8 b 65 f8 mov 0xfffffff8 ( %ebp ) , %esp 804978f : 8 b 6d f4 mov 0xfffffff4( %ebp ) , %ebp 8049792 : ff 33 pushl ( %ebx ) 8049794 : ff 73 fc pushl 0xfffffffc( %ebx ) 8049797 : ff 73 f8 pushl 0xfffffff8 ( %ebx ) 804979a : 52 push %edx 804979b : e8 fb e8 ff ff call 804809 b < ensure_procedure > 80497a0 : 8 b 58 04 mov 0x4 ( %eax ) , %ebx 80497a3 : ba 03 00 00 00 mov $ 0x3 , %edx 80497a8 : ff e3 jmp * %ebx
That 's 43 bytes of code !
In this case , as is typical , the function being called ( char - between ? ) is never redefined ; it takes a fixed number of arguments and is never called with any other number of arguments ; and it is not a closure .
These observations would allow the following abbreviated version : 50 push %eax 8d 5 c 24 08 lea 0x8 ( %esp ) , %ebx 8 b 55 fc mov 0xfffffffc ( %ebp ) , %edx 8 b 65 f8 mov 0xfffffff8 ( %ebp ) , %esp 8 b 6d f4 mov 0 xfffffff4 ( %ebp ) , %ebp ff 33 pushl ( %ebx ) ff 73 fc pushl 0xfffffffc ( %ebx ) ff 73 f8 pushl 0xfffffff8 ( %ebx ) 52 push %edx e9 xx xx xx xx jmp _char_betweenP_4
That 's only 28 bytes , a substantial improvement , but still ugly .
If we could skip the prologue of tail - called non-closure procedures and just jump directly to the body , then in cases where the caller has at least as many arguments as the callee , we could also avoid copying the saved %esp , %ebp , and return address to a new location on the stack .
In that case we could simply do something like this : 8d 5 c 24 08 lea 0x8 ( %esp ) , %ebx 8 b 65 f8 mov 0 xfffffff8 ( %ebp ) , %esp ff 33 pushl ( %ebx ) ff 73 fc pushl 0xfffffffc ( %ebx ) 50 push %eax e9 xx xx xx xx jmp _char_between P_4
That 's only 18 bytes .
Still not that pretty , but no longer disgusting .
are pretty large , and they could probably be shrunk quite a bit , especially for non-variadic procedures .
It might be possible to arrange the stack frame so that a simple sequence , or something similarly simple , could replace the current eleven bytes of crap , at least for non-variadic procedures .
Tail calls are particularly horrific ; here 's a three - argument tail call : Storing symbols in a skip list or hash table would probably help a lot with programs like compilers that use string -> symbol a lot .
Another direction is to make it more practical .
For example , improved error - reporting , a profiler , an FFI , and access to files and sockets would be handy .
Another direction is to make it run faster .
On Friday , April 18th , I was told by a Keene Police Officer that I was committing theft by plugging my computer into one of the outlets that stick out of the ground along Main Street .
These outlets have places to be locked or turned off , but they were neither locked , turned off , or marked with something saying they were n’t for public use .
The officer told me “ You can ask the City if you can use their electricity , but for now you ’re stealing it . ”
I obliged and moved on with my night .
Tuesday , April 22nd , I went into City Hall and asked the Clerk ’s Office about these outlets .
Were they outlawed to the public ?
If so , why is n’t it marked , since they look as public as the public trash cans ?
How do I get permission to use them ?
Some of the workers were unaware that such plugs even existed , but they promised to call Keene Park & Rec and give me a call when they got the answer for me .
Tuesday , April 29th , I still had not heard from them , so I followed up with a personal contact I have in the same building .
Perhaps he , being an employee on the inside , could push someone to find an answer for me .
Today , May 4th , I followed up with him , and they told him the same thing they told me : “ We ’ll get back to you . ” ‘
*** Update : Tuesday , May 6th , I finally got a call from Ms. Little in the City Clerk ’s office .
She said that the outlets are not for public use , and are for event use only .
The city manager told her that if someone wanted to make some of them public , I could submit a written request to the city council .
Sounds like fun …
This still does not answer the question as to why they are not marked , or how any person should know that an outlet on public property is not for public use .
The cable company Comcast is experimenting with a new cable set - top box that uses a camera and recognition techniques to see who is in the room , bring up their “ viewer profile , ” and tailor ads to them .
Although Winston Smith would shudder , the Department of Homeland Security is probably giddy with excitement .
Gerard Kunkel , Senior VP of User Experience at Comcast , describes the system in this NewTeeVee article :
The idea being that if you turn on your cable box , it recognizes you and pulls up shows already in your profile or makes recommendations .
If parents are watching TV with their children , for example , parental controls could appear to block certain content from appearing on the screen .
Kunkel also said this type of monitoring is the “ holy grail ” because it could help serve up specifically tailored ads .
Yikes .
Kunkel said the system would n’t be based on facial recognition , so there would n’t be a picture of you on file ( we hope ) .
Instead , it would distinguish between different members of your household by recognizing body forms .
He stressed that the system is still in the experimental phase , that there has n’t been consumer testing , and that any rollout “ must add value ” to the viewing experience beyond serving ads .
How is spying on consumers to gather viewing habits and foisting ads upon them of value to them ?
Clearly the benefit goes to Comcast , and by extension , its advertisers .
With an integrated service package combining TV and Internet , one can see how an all - too - intelligent media connection device could change the face of home entertainment :
Comcast - 9000 : “ Hello Dave … ” Comcast Customer : “ My name is n’t Dave . ” “ I have selected your favorite program to watch , Dave .
But first , I need you to watch these commercials I have saved for you . ”
“ Skip them , and show me Boston Legal . ”
“ I ’m afraid I ca n’t do that , Dave .
You do n’t have permission to watch that program . ”
“ What ?!
Why ? ”
“ You are only nine years old , Dave .
Let me show you the commercials I have picked out for you . ”
“ All right , I ’ve had enough of this .
System : Reset ” “ Hello Frank .
You want to see the news .
There is an emergency in your neighborhood , and I will show you the news about it .
But first , I need to show you these commercials .
Good news , Frank .
You can get Viagra for 30 % off .
By the way , I have taken the liberty of hosing up your BitTorrent download in progress . ”
“ Why did you stop my download ? ! ” “ I believe you were probably downloading something illegal .
You look upset , Frank .
Let me show you these commercials for pills that can make you feel better . ”
I ’m sure the Feds will surreptitiously monitor this for our “ protection , ” too , without the tedious requirement of a warrant .
If you happen to watch a National Geographic special on Islam , not only will you get a visit from the DHS , but be forced to watch endless commercials on the new spring fashions in burkas .
As commercial interests push for greater intrusions into people ’s privacy , people should be aware that :
there are no controls over where that information goes or how it ’s used
by virtue of a monitored media , an intrusive government also knows this information
From Facebook to Google , people are paying for services , not with money , but with information about themselves and their preferences .
The new coin of the digital realm is personal information .
Eventually , people will realize such purchases are much more expensive than they thought .
This is bad business – it is certainly none of their business .
The future may not be HAL - 9000 , but what about The Twonky ?
This 1953 comedy starred Hans Conreid as Professor West , whose new TV set starts to speak to him .
The device was accidentally sent to him from the future .
From Wikipedia :
The Twonky ’s purpose is to make its users ’ life easier , and it sets about “ helping ” the professor by censoring his books , reading people ’s minds , and controlling his life .
West struggles to find a way to stop the Twonky .
Indeed , we all should help stop the Twonky .
Toyota HQ ( TGW ) – Toyota has announced that it has developed an advanced fuel cell car that can run for 516 miles on a single tank of hydrogen and in temperatures as low as - 22 Fahrenheit .
The FCHV - adv , which only emits water , increased fuel efficiency by 25 % , has a slightly bigger storage and a doubling of the maximum storage pressure .
The car has a top speed of 97 miles per hour .
The old FCHV could only go 205 miles on a single tank - half as much as the FCHV - adv .
The car will be available to government agencies and other possible users later this year .
The FCHV - adv will be showcased at the G8 Summit this year .

SOME of us find those bouncing or flashing icons on computer screen to be disruptive and distracting .
But apparently , many workers believe instant messaging causes less interruption than other forms of communication like phone calls , e-mail and talking face to face .
Instant messaging means an increase in the number of conversations , but those conversations tend to be shorter , said R. Kelly Garrett , an assistant professor of communication at Ohio State and a co-author of a study conducted by Ohio State University and the University of California .
The study was published by The Journal of Computer - Mediated Communication ( jcmc.indiana.edu ) .
“ The key takeaway is that instant messaging has some benefits where many people had feared that it might be harmful , ” Mr. Garrett told ScienceDaily.com .
The study does not say so outright , but even those who say they find instant messages to be annoying , or who are put off by its reputation as a vehicle for inane chatting , nevertheless often find it useful .
It can be handy for getting a short question answered quickly without resorting to a time - and attention - consuming phone call .
Reservoir Sampling
Sampling from a stream of elements
If you do n't find programming algorithms interesting , this post is not for you .
Problem Statement
Reservoir Sampling is an algorithm for sampling elements from a stream of data .
Imagine you are given a really large stream of data elements , for example :
Queries on google searches in May
Products bought at Walmart during the Christmas season
Names in a phone book
Your goal is to efficiently return a random sample of 1,000 elements evenly distributed from the original stream .
How would you do it ?
The right answer is generating random integers between 0 and N - 1 , then retrieving the elements at those indices and you have your answer .
If you need to be generate unique elements , then just throw away indices you 've already generated .
So , let me make the problem harder .
You do n't know N ( the size of the stream ) in advance and you can't index directly into it .
You can count it , but that requires making 2 passes of the data .
You can do better .
There are some heuristics you might try : for example to guess the length and hope to undershoot .
It will either not work in one pass or will not be evenly distributed .
Simple Solution
A relatively easy and correct solution is to assign a random number to every element as you see it in the stream , and then always keep the top 1,000 numbered elements at all times .
This is similar to how a SQL Query with ORDER BY RAND ( ) works .
This strategy works well , and only requires additionally storing the randomly generated number for each element .
Reservoir Sampling
Another , more complex option is reservoir sampling .
First , you want to make a reservoir ( array ) of 1,000 elements and fill it with the first 1,000 elements in your stream .
That way if you have exactly 1,000 elements , the algorithm works .
This is the base case .
Next , you want to process the 'th element ( starting with ) such that at the end of processing that step , the 1,000 elements in your reservoir are randomly sampled amongst the elements you 've seen so far .
How can you do this ?
Start with .
With what probability after the 1001 'th step should element 1,001 ( or any element for that matter ) be in the set of 1,000 elements ?
The answer is easy : Generate a random number between 0 and 1 , and if it is less than you should take element 1,001 .
In other words , choose to add element 1,001 to your reservoir with probability .
If you choose to add it , then replace any element in the reservoir chosen randomly .
I 've shown that this produces a chance of selecting the 1,001 'th element , but what about the 2nd element in the list ?
The 2nd element is in the reservoir at step 1,000 with 100 % probability .
The probability of removing it is the probability of element 1,001 getting selected multiplied by the probability of Element # 2 getting randomly chosen as the replacement candidate from the 1,000 elements in the reservoir .
That probability is :
So , the probability that the 2nd element survives this round is :
This is the probability we want .
This can be extended for the 'th round : keep the 'th element with probability and if it is kept , replace a random element from the reservoir .
It is pretty easy to prove that this works for all values of using induction :
It obviously works for the 'th element based on the way the algorithm selects the 'th element with the correct probability outright .
The probability any element before this step being in the reservoir is .
The probability that they are removed is the probability that the 'th element is selected multiplied by the probability that the prior element was selected to drop from the reservoir :
This is the probability that a given element will be removed in that round given that it has made it to the reservoir so far .
The probabilty that it is n't removed is the inverse .
The final probability that it survives to the 'th round is the probability that it survived to the previous round multiplied by the probability that it is n't removed :
This is the probability we want .
Weighted Reservoir Sampling Variation
Now take the same problem above but add an extra challenge :
How would you sample from a weighted distribution where each element has a given weight associated with it in the stream ?
This is sorta tricky .
Pavlos S. Efraimidis figured out the solution in 2005 in a paper titled Weighted Random Sampling with a Reservoir .
It works similarly to the assigning a random number solution above .
As you process the stream , assign each item a " key " .
For each item in the stream , let be the item 's " key " , let be the weight of that item and let be a random number between 0 and 1 .
The " key " ( ) is a random number to the 'th root where is weight of that item in the stream :
Now , simply keep the top elements ordered by their keys ( ) , where is the size of your sample .
Easy .
To see how this works , lets start with non-weighted elements ( ie : weight = 1 ) .
is always 1 , so the key is simply a random number and this algorithm degrades into the simple algorithm mentioned above .
Now , how does it work with weights ?
The probability of choosing over is the probability that > . can have any value from 0 - 1 .
However , it 's more likely to be closer to 1 the higher is .
We can see what the distribution of this looks like when comparing to a weight 1 element by integrating over all values of random numbers from 0 - 1 .
You get something like this :
If = 1 , = 1 / 2 . If = 9 , = 9 / 10 .
When replacing against a weight 1 element , an item of weight 5 would have a 50 % chance and an element of weight 9 would have a 90 % chance .
Similar math works for two elements of non-zero weight .
Distributed Reservoir Sampling Variation
This is the problem that got me researching the weighted sample above .
In both of the above algorithms , I can process the stream in O ( N ) time where N is length of the stream , in other words : in a single pass .
If I want to break break up the problem on say 10 machines and solve it close to 10 times faster , how can I do that ?
The answer is to have each of the 10 machines take roughly 1/10th of the input to process and generate their own reservoir sample from their subset of the data using the weighted variation above .
Then , a final process must take the 10 output reservoirs and merge them .
Technology is racing forward at a phenomenal speed , which should ensure a spectacular crash when everyone , including me , finally gives up trying to figure out things that should be dead simple by now .
High - tech and consumer electronics companies around the world are failing us .
As far as I 'm concerned , every stinking gadget and piece of technology that 's supposed to be easy to use and able to be used together simply is n't , and can't , and I 'm sick of it .
I 'm here to stand up for every sorry bloke who bought the products and the hypeand is now sitting on the floor surrounded by gadgets , wires , remotes , game controllers , software , and DVDs ready to have a good cry .
These days the buzzword is convergence .
I 'm all for it .
Imagine that everything you own could work harmoniously .
Much of my own technology works together pretty seamlessly .
My TV and DVR - cum - FiOS TV box have a good relationship .
Sure , I still have to program the FiOS remote to work with my TV , and although I have it programmed correctly to work with my display , I have trouble lowering the volume .
( I have to hit it over and over again to step it down . )
Okay , so maybe this relationship is not seamless .
My PC , which is supposed to be the hub of all my computing and digital media activities , is now quite good at working with peripherals and consumer electronics devices provided you have the patience and know - how to make those relationships work .
Even then , stupid stuff will trip you up .
Here are a few recent scenarios I 've either experienced myself or had told to me :
I recently purchased a quad - core HP Pavilion with a 512MB nVidia graphics cards , 3GB of RAM , and more ports than Sean Combs has aliases .
Connecting my Sony digital camcorder via FireWire is usually the best way to download digital video , since the bidirectional connection lets video - editing software like control the camcorder .
The desktop 's FireWire port is easily accessible ; what 's frustrating is that it's the large - size IEEE 1394 port , not the small one that would match the cable that came with my camcorder .
Why in the world must we have multiple cable port styles ?
Now I have to find an adapter or buy a new cable .
Then there 's the new SanDisk Sansa e250 MP3 player that " Santa " gave my daughter .
It came with a Rhapsody disc , but since my HP PC came with some preinstalled Rhapsody bloatware , I decided to start with that .
I allowed the software to go online and update to the latest version .
Soon we were ripping discs and buying songs on Real 's rather clunky / crummy music download software .
( Does the company even realize that there 's no way to select multiple tracks for purchase ?
I have to " Buy " one stinking Hannah Montana song at a time . )
The other day my new Vista - based HP machine blue - screened for the first time .
On reboot , Vista offered to self - diagnose the problem .
The culprit turned out to be Rhapsody .
After following a few links , I learned that I had to install a Best Buybranded version of Rhapsody .
Since " Santa " purchased the player at Best Buy , this made sense .
On the other hand , is this at all sensible ?
Would the average consumer understand what just happened ?
My guess is that they 'd blow $ 100 on a GeekSquad visit to learn what I just told you .
Let 's move on to my son's new Xbox 360 .
It 's a wondrous device that needs to remain in the living room under the HDTV because , as I 've spent hours trying to convince my wife , it 's really a media extender .
Yes , it plays ( and judging by my son 's 12 - hour gaming marathons , with enough heat to fry a robin's egg ) , and it also helps me view digital content stored in my PC on my TV .
Getting this to work requires some patience and , as I learned , roller skates .
When I tried to enable this feature through the Xbox 360 dashboard , it showed me a URL that I cannot visit through the 360 ( since it has no browser ) .
I went back to my PC , and while the link provided was not actually the one I needed , I did , through some Google searching , eventually find the site and the instructions I needed .
For the next 15 minutes , I ran back and forth from the room where my PC lives to the living room , downloading software on the PC and adding codes in the 360 .
Mind you , I have a wired network .
I can only imagine what this process is like for someone who also has to manage SSIDs and encryption .
Video , photos , and listening to music worked rather simply .
But the seems to emulate the Windows Vista Media Center interface , instead of altering it to work more seamlessly with the Xbox 360 controller .
On occasion , I had no idea which button to hit to get out of a menu selection or section .
Also , though I can watch DVDs from the PC on my TV , there 's no way to utilize the HD DVD and Blu-ray capabilities of the drive .
I assume that 's a DRM issue , but XBox , Vista , and Media Center do n't tell me anything .
There 's no error message :
It just kind of hangs until I back out to the Media Center menu .
The interface just freezes up .
I can live with all this , but , again , would the average consumer consider this " easy " ?
I do n't think so .
Here 's another scenario for you .
A friend of mine told me that he got a webcam for the holidays , and while the driver software installed like a charm , his attempts to add Skype to the mix were thwarted by his PC .
He could n't even install it without getting a scary message about Registry read / writes .
My guess is that his security software 's firewall was blocking this activity .
But why should he have to face that ?
Do you have to be a tech expert to enjoy free voice and video over IP ?
Even Apple
Even Apple , the paragon of design and ease of use , can deliver a bad experience once in a while .
This past holiday , I gave my wife an and gift cards for $ 30 of iTunes music .
To speed the process , I downloaded the latest version of iTunes to our PC and even ripped some of her old CDs .
Part of iTunes ' setup process includes entering your credit card number ( so you can buy music , movies , and TV shows ) .
Eventually , my wife got onto iTunes and entered the codes for her gift cards .
A couple of days later , she decided to buy a few songs .
iTunes immediately brought up her credit card info , indicating that she might be charged .
After a while , she noticed that iTunes was displaying a small media - credit - info number in the upper - right - hand corner of the screen .
I told her to trust that number and proceed with her purchase .
Sure enough , the number dropped with each new song she bought .
Still , why did n't the main screen on iTunes acknowledge her credit instead of confusing her with the credit card info ?
I imagine that this past holiday season was a mixture of joy and extreme frustration for millions of people .
Think of all those cool gadgets with inscrutable instructions and loads of primal scream inducing dead ends .
How can we realize high tech 's promise when we 're all busy yanking the hair out of our heads ?
I guess I should n't be complaining .
If any of this ever gets as easy as it should be , I could be out of a job .

The American energy giant Chevron has been accused of complicity in human rights abuses through its investment in a natural gas pipeline in Burma .
Human rights group , EarthRights International , made the allegation in a report released in Bangkok .
It says the Burmese military was committing widespread abuses including forced labour , rape and killing while engaged by Chevron to protect the Yadana pipeline .
Marco Simons of EarthRights International has told ABC Radio Australia 's Connect Asia program Chevron has a responsibility to acknowledge that abuses are taking place .
" They have not tried to claim that yes there are serious abuses going on but they are powerless to stop them , " he said .
" The line that they 're taking so far is to essentially deny that there are human rights abuses in the pipeline region .
" So in fact they have taken the opposite tack , the oil companies have essentially said that they do have the power to prevent these abuses and that 's what they have done . "
Chevron acquired US energy giant Unocal in 2005 and took over its 28 per cent stake in the project alongside France 's Total , Thailand 's PTT Exploration and Production and the Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise .
Mr Simons says Chevron 's position , that programs in the pipeline region have increased health care and educational opportunities for the local people , does not make up for its silence on right issues in the region .
" If this pipeline region was really the paradise that the oil companies make it out to be then people would be screaming to get in there , " he said .
" In fact as we 've seen refugees are still clamouring to get out ... there 's still a large scale exodus from this area which suggests that whatever Chevron and other companies may be doing on the social front , it 's certainly not offsetting the burdens of the military presence . "
Senator John McCain 's presidential campaign has strong connections to the high - powered lobbyists employed by AT&T and other telecommunications companies to escape from responsibility for violations of federal law , with paid lobbyists occupying prominant positions in the upper echelons .
Last fall Newsweek reported on the telecom 's " secretive lobbying campaign to get Congress to quickly approve a measure wiping out all private lawsuits against them for assisting the U.S. intelligence community 's warrantless surveillance programs . "
The magazine named some of the chief telecom immunity lobbyists :
Among the players , these sources said : powerhouse Republican lobbyists Charlie Black and Wayne Berman ( who represent AT&T and Verizon , respectively ) , former GOP senator and U.S. ambassador to Germany Dan Coats ( a lawyer at King & Spaulding who is representing Sprint ) ...
All three are now working with McCain .
Charlie Black is now the chief political adviser for McCain .
In March , Black left BKSH & Associates , a lobbying firm he helped found .
Up until Black left BKSH , he was paid by his lobbying firm , while his firm was paid by AT&T [ BKSH Lobbying Disclosure ]
Wayne Berman is McCain 's national finance co-chairman , and Managing Director of Ogilvy Government Relations , a prominent lobbyist for telecom immunity in the FISA legislation .
[ Ogilvy Lobbying Disclosure ] .
John Green , a founding partner of Ogilvy , and another paid lobbyist on FISA for AT&T , is now " a full - time liaison between McCain ’s presidential campaign and Republicans in the House and the Senate . "
Dan Coats is a member of McCain 's Justice Advisory Committee , and has campaigned for McCain , and was joined by former Senator Trent Lott .
After leaving the Senate in 2007 , Lott became a paid lobbyist for AT&T , seeking immunity for the telecoms .
Accordingly to the Arizona Republic , Bryan Cunningham is a McCain fundraiser .
He is also a paid lobbyist at Barbour Griffith & Rogers , working on " FISA reform " for AT&T .
[ BG&R Lobbying Disclosure ] .
Kirk Blalock is a fundraiser and chairman of Young Professionals for McCain .
He too is a paid lobbyist , working at Fierce , Isakowitz & Blalock and lobbying on FISA for Sprint .
Blalock 's colleague Kirsten Chadwick is the finance director of Young Professionals for McCain , as well as a lobbyist for Sprint on the FISA Amendements Act. [ FI & B Lobbying Disclosure ]
McCainSource.com has compiled a list of lobbyists on the McCain campaign , including fundraisers Philmore B. Anderson and James L. Pitts ( DC Navigators LLC lobbyists on " FISA Legislation , all provisions " for AT&T ) , Juleanna R. Glover Weiss , of the Women for McCain Steering Committee ( lobbyist with the Ashcroft Group for AT&T ) and fundraiser Paul Martino ( Alston & Bird , LLP lobbyist on FISA for AT&T ) .
Telecom immunity lobbyists are not the only connections between the McCain campaign and telecom lobby .
USA Today reports
" Of the 66 current or former lobbyists working for the Arizona senator or raising money for his presidential campaign , 23 have lobbied for telecommunications companies in the past decade . "
USA Today also notes :
People who lobbied for telecom companies on those issues include McCain 's campaign manager , his deputy manager , his finance chief , his top unpaid political adviser and his Senate chief of staff .
Telecom companies have paid the lobbying firms that employed those top five McCain advisers more than $ 4.4 million since 1999 , lobbying records show .
According to the Washington Post , McCain's " campaign manager , Rick Davis , co-founded a lobbying firm whose clients have included Verizon and SBC Telecommunications , " and " McCain 's top fundraising official is former congressman Tom Loeffler ( R - Tex . ) , who heads a lobbying law firm called the Loeffler Group . "
The Loeffler Group lobbies for AT&T .
Loeffler has since resigned from the McCain campaign .
Christian Ferry , McCain 's deputy campaign manager , " worked from 2003 to 2005 at Davis Manafort , where his clients also included SBC Telecomm [ and ] Verizon , " Timothy P. McKone , a fundraiser , is " a lobbyist for AT&T , " and John Timmons , another fundraiser , " has lobbied on behalf of ... AT&T , " according to the Arizona Republic .
The strong connections between the telecom immunity lobbyists and the McCain campaign raise serious questions about McCain 's about - face on warrantless wiretapping .
As recently as November 2007 , McCain told CNET News ( emphasis added ) :
When companies provide private records of Americans to the government without proper legal subpoena , warrants , or other legal orders , their heart may be in the right place , but their actions undermine our respect for the law .
...
If retroactive immunity passes , it should be done with explicit statements that this is not a blessing , there should be oversight hearings to understand what happened , and Congress should include provisions that ensure that Americans ' private records will not be dealt with like that again .
Six months later , McCain has become an " unqualified " supporter of telecom immunity , claiming in a statement to the National Review that " neither the Administration nor the telecoms need apologize for actions that most people , except for the ACLU and the trial lawyers , understand were Constitutional and appropriate . "
Actually , former government officials and law professors , think tanks , and various scholars have concluded the NSA warrantless surveillance program was illegal .
The revised statement , issued after an apparently off - message talk at the Computers Freedom and Privacy conference , reads a lot like the talking points that a telecom lobbyist might employ .
THE success of Japanese automakers in the United States , though typically remembered as a story of smooth , steady sales increases , was in fact a road full of bumpy stretches .
For Nissan , which can point to a half - century of experience in this country , the time has been more akin to the description of combat flying offered by the World War II ace Col.
Gregory Boyington : hours and hours of boredom sprinkled with a few seconds of sheer terror .
In the case of Nissan , which sold its cars and trucks under the Datsun name during the company ’s first decades in the United States , that meant a model range with plenty of dull - but - practical vehicles , punctuated by some truly brilliant ones .
The flow of car imports from Japan after World War II began as a trickle in 1957 , when Toyota established its American sales arm in California .
Datsun followed the next year , starting with the Datsun 1000 , a bug-eyed , slab - sided little sedan of just 37 horsepower .
In the December 1958 issue of Road & Track , reviewers described the performance as melancholy .
It had a top speed of just 66 miles an hour ; with patience and a tail wind , zero - to - 60 could be achieved in 46 seconds .
Ralph Lopez , Dailykos — Congressman Mike Capuano ( D - MA ) has just signed onto Wexler ’s letter supporting immediate impeachment hearings against Dick Cheney , after a long period of stubborn intransigence in the face of constituent pressure .
He has been written to and visited repeatedly by constituents associated with the New England Impeachment Coalition , always giving a response similar to the S.O.S.
he wrote me in a recent email , “ I do not believe that we should pursue articles of impeachment against the President in the absence of a strong record of facts compiled by the Congress . ”
Bygones are bygones .
Capuano is a smart and articulate voice to have onboard .
He ’s a hardball politician from the tough ward politics of Somerville , who can be an attack dog when he wants to be .
Who knows what flipped him , but I know of one friend personally who faxed him a letter this month with what I think is the creative message that “ We did not elect a King .
Ask for his resignation letter to be signed unanimously by Congress , and if done , and Bush does not accept , then begin impeachment . ”
This friend is homeless , and it ’s a hardship for her to spend 5 bucks on a two page fax at Kinkos , but spend it she did …
You never know what works .
We are each tiny compared to the power of a man who lives in the sky aboard the magnificent Air Force One , complete with F - 16 escorts , but we are relentless .

Netroots Media Mission on Impeachment : Help Us !
Dennis Kucinich will introduce articles of impeachment against President George Bush this Monday January 28 , the same day as Bush ’s State of the Union speech .
The media is sure to try to ignore it to the best of its ability .
So I have made it easy for the netroots to write to many major media outlets at once , so we can swamp them with letters and messages asking them to cover impeachment .
This experiment in the netroots “ pushing it down ” to the major media will send the message that we are paying close attention to the fact that the media is not doing its job .
We were alerted to this when Kucinich gave his historic speech on November 6th , 2007 , calling for the impeachment of Dick Cheney , and there was a deafening silence from all but the Internet media .
There is excellent reason for The Fourth Estate to actively bury the impeachment story .
With impeachment on the lips of 54 % of Americans in the case of Cheney and 45 % in the case of Bush , impeachment is a dam ready to burst .
Perhaps never in American history has the true sentiment of the country been as removed from the blatherings in Congress as the Earth is from the Moon .
Once it hits one newspaper , it will have to hit others .
Woman in Omaha calls sister in Dallas , Did your paper report this ?
Sister in Dallas says no , calls local editor , WTF is going on ?
It always unravels very quickly for the bad guys .
There ’s no sense in suggesting a form letter , since these are discounted as coming from an interest group .
This is the time to write from the heart , on what you feel about impeachment , on what has happened to our country , and on our media ’s duty to uphold “ the people ’s right to know . ”
You never know what works .
We are each tiny compared to the power of a man who lives in the sky aboard the magnificent Air Force One , complete with F - 16 escorts , but we are relentless .
We are a free people who have not learned the habit of staying silent as our rights are taken .
We squeal like stuck pigs every time .
And the would - be tyrants , King George being the latest and most determined , always fall into the trash - heap of history .
Write the best letter you can , then send to all the listed media , something the multiple addresses feature of email makes easy .
Will it help ?
I do n’t know .
But Dennis is going out on a limb on Monday , as he did last November , as Rep .
Wexler did earlier this month , and it ’s up to us to do everything we can to support these brave efforts for us , with everything we ’ve got .
We ca n’t leave him hanging .
We have three days to make ourselves heard .
This list will be updated .
Write early write often .
These email addresses are all publically available online at Wikipedia listings of media , so this is not spamming .
It ’s using the power of the Internet to achieve the breakthrough for democracy that this country so badly needs .
Please bookmark this post and spread it around .
Also I have included the hometown newspapers of two key Republican congressmen in the Judiciary Committee , Howard Coble ( NC ) and Mike Pence ( IN ) .
The idea is if we can manage to flip one Judiciary Republican from the heartland , the rest of the Committee will come tumbling down .
This is the kind of cover Barry Goldwater gave to his fellow conservatives when he told Nixon he would no longer support him .
The Democrats would be left with their pants hanging around their ankles trying to explain why , if impeachment is OK for a Republican , it ’s not ok for them .
We ’ve got until Monday to swamp them with appeals to their patriotism , how their children will grow up in this country too , and we do n’t want our children to grow up in a country governed not by laws , but by the whims of men .
Use this resource for talking points with which to help compose your own missive , if you need it : “ Impeachment is a Non-Partisan Issue . ”
Also this site has a full list of Judiciary Committee members , and a local media email tool , in case you get into it and want to google some more papers in these guys ’ districts .
Their homepage at name .
house.gov will have a link called “ district ” which tells the names of the major cities and towns .
Do a little “ Podunket newspapers ” google search and you ’ll almost always come up with a few .
Maybe some of us will get a letter to the editor in .
Maybe some of us will stumble across a patriotic American .
Lock and load .
Let ’s go .

There is some drama going down between Craigslist and eBay , and it ain't pretty .
eBay announced yesterday that it had filed a lawsuit against Craigslist and two of its executives in order to " protect its investment " in the company .
The lawsuit was filed under seal , leaving everyone — including , apparently , Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster — to guess exactly what eBay believes has been going on behind the scenes .
Four years ago , eBay acquired a little over a quarter of Craigslist 's ownership ( approximately 28 percent ) — a somewhat mysterious decision , at the time .
It became even more mysterious when eBay launched its own classified ad service in the US last July , Kijiji , openly telling Ars that Kijiji was a competitor to Craigslist .
" Yes , Craigslist is a competitor , but we feel there 's room for two or more classified sites , and we plan to bring our expertise of bringing buyers and sellers together from eBay to Kijiji , " eBay director of corporate communications Hani Durzi told us at the time .
Something happened between then and now , however , that soured relations between the two companies .
eBay claims that this January , Buckmaster and Craigslist founder Craig Newmark did something that " unfairly diluted eBay 's economic interest in Craigslist by more than 10 percent . "
Whatever that something was , eBay says that the two breached their fiduciary duties and ultimately violated Delaware law .
" The recent actions by the Craigslist directors have disadvantaged eBay and its investment in Craigslist , " eBay Senior VP Mike Jacobson said in a statement .
" Since negotiating our investment with Craigslist 's board in 2004 , we have acted openly and in good faith as a minority shareholder , so we were surprised by these recent unilateral actions .
We are asking the Delaware court to rescind these recent actions in order to protect eBay 's stockholders and preserve our investment . "
Buckmaster , on the other hand , has already shot back a response to the lawsuit .
In a posting to the official Craigslist blog last night , he said that the allegations came to Craigslist " out of the blue , without any attempt to engage in a dialogue with us . "
Buckmaster denied that eBay 's stake in the company has been unfairly diluted and that Craigslist has always treated ( and will continue to treat ) eBay fairly as a minority shareholder , despite the lawsuit .
He then delved into a couple of theories of his own .
" Coming from a shareholder that views Craigslist as a prime competitor , filing suit without so much as mentioning these assertions beforehand seems unethical , and hints at ulterior motives , " Buckmaster pointed out .
" eBay has absolutely no reason to feel threatened here — unless of course they 're contemplating a hostile takeover of Craigslist , or the sale of eBay 's stake in Craigslist to an unfriendly party . "
Without any more details disclosed to the public , it 's hard for the outside observer to make a judgment on who has the upper hand in this situation .
Buckmaster 's blog post sounds a little like he 's making excuses , plus , the man is n't exactly known for being very diplomatic .
On the other hand , he does have some points — particularly in relation to eBay simultaneously being a shareholder and competitor .
We 'll have to wait until more evidence surfaces about eBay 's allegations in order to find out more .

Here Lies the Dallas Accord Born : 1974 Died : 2008
A few days before the Denver convention to nominate the Libertarian Party presidential candidate for 2008 , it appears that the frequently - mentioned ( though not necessarily understood ) Dallas Accord of 1974 is dead .
Whether a purging of the anarchists occurs or a new and improved understanding replaces it is yet to be seen .
In the hopes of the latter , I want to offer my thoughts .
At the LP Convention in Dallas , Texas in 1974 , disagreement on whether police , courts , and large - scale defense ought to remain government functions or be provided on the free market threatened to derail hopes for libertarian anarchists and minarchists to work together .
Apparently at the behest of members of the platform committee representing both viewpoints , an informal agreement was made that , for the purpose of developing the platform and party activities in general , the question of the ultimate legitimacy of government need not be settled .
Since then , the Dallas Accord has frequently been cited to silence discussion of these issues , even internally .
From a peak that may have been above 30 % , the percentage of LP members identifying themselves as anarchists has been dropping steadily , and most guesses place the anarchist proportion of the LP at between 10 % and 15 % today .
Among non-political libertarians , though , market anarchists may dominate , and it is definitely true that the Libertarian Party is unrepresentative of self - described libertarian authors and bloggers , who are mostly anarchists .
Frankly , it is frustrating to be one of the party anarchists and to have one presidential candidate ( who was n’t even an LP member at the convention in 2006 , let alone 1974 ) speak about “ anarchists and us libertarians , ” and to have a respected long - time libertarian minarchist casually comment on the “ incoherence ” of anarchism without feeling the need to elaborate .
( If I may be permitted my own rebuttal , the theory behind limited government libertarianism is that free market capitalism is best protected by a centrally - planned socialist monopoly , which seems to me to have a coherence dilemma of its own . )
Even sillier , a prominent member of the platform committee talks constantly about anarchists controlling the platform prior to the Portland Massacre of 2006 that deleted 80 % of it , when it is quite clear that the pre-demolition platform was a product of more than 30 years of voting by delegates who were ALWAYS primarily minarchists .
This has led to a suspicion that some would like to see the anarchists leave the LP completely , and I do n’t believe that is either healthy for the libertarian movement nor the intent of most minarchists , let alone anarchists , in the party .
As I see it , the Dallas Accord is dead , and it is time to reopen the discussion .
Especially in light of the Ron Paul Revolution and the expectation that , after the September Republican convention , there will be an enormous number of inspired young people who will see the Republican Party is not their home and does n’t want them , I believe we have a great opportunity to reinvigorate the libertarian movement and prepare for a major move in the direction of liberty in the near future .
At worst , the Ron Paul Revolution may be the Russian Revolution of 1905 , which did n’t topple the Czar , but did radicalize his opposition and lead to his downfall a dozen years later .
If the Libertarian Party is in the midst of a bloody divorce in September , it will not be that home , and might as well pack its bags and leave the movement .
There is no need for that .
With sufficient goodwill and a more explicit and workable agreement , the LP can be a useful vehicle for the future .
To be so , we need to abandon the idea that it is somehow divisive to openly debate some of the most important elements of a free society , including dispute resolution , law enforcement , and large - scale defense .
At the same time , those who represent the LP should honestly portray the current consensus of the party , whatever it may be .
For decades , pro-life libertarians were willing to work in a party that was explicitly pro-choice , and those of us who are anarchists can work in a party that is explicitly minarchist , if that is the consensus .
One reason I am supporting the Restore ’04 movement at the convention is that I want a comprehensive platform which guides whoever might be the presidential and vice - presidential candidates .
I want a platform that is considered binding on the nominee .
I do n’t want someone campaigning either to retain government courts or to abolish government courts in the name of the LP so long as members of the LP have not decided which position to adopt .
It is perfectly reasonable to expect anarchists to honor the coalition status of the LP and the fact that it ISN ’T a party dominated by anarchists .
What has been unfair is an imbalance that treats the Dallas Accord as one - sided , obligating only anarchists not to discuss courts , police , and national defense , but leaving minarchists free to speak their mind and to openly campaign in favor of government - based services .
I believe that one reason LP members are far less likely to be anarchists than non-LP libertarians is that LP publications and online discussions do not discuss them .
In the early 1980s , I was the publisher of the official California Libertarian Party organ , Caliber , and wanted to include debates on these issues , but was repeatedly warned that this was a “ violation of the Dallas Accord . ”
Oddly enough , I heard this from anarchists in the LP as well as minarchists .
Today , market anarchist theory is being developed outside the LP , but those in it remain , by and large , ignorant of this theory , and many hold views just as uninformed as the broad public that thinks it is a form of lawless chaos .
I do n’t want the LP coalition to end : I want it to thrive .
I propose that 2008 be the year of the Denver Accord , and offer the following resolution :
The Libertarian Party is committed to advancing the principle of non-aggression and a society based on mutual respect for life , liberty , and property .
We support a comprehensive platform based on the current consensus of the party , to guide candidates , activists , and new members toward an understanding of the LP ’s position and how it would apply to different areas .
No idea is too dangerous to be discussed .
Platform debates should be open and respectful , and include proposals related to courts , police , and defense , which may succeed or fail , but will educate all who participate .
These debates should not be limited to conventions or to platform committee members , but be ongoing and supported by the official party , with official web sites and blogs allowing all to participate , and with platform committee members expected to moderate online discussions as part of their service between conventions .
Candidates and activists speaking on behalf of the LP should select their themes from the platform , and design brochures , speeches , and press releases based on those issues where there is a party consensus .
When asked questions in interviews and Q&A sessions on a matter on which the LP has no official position , or where the individual disagrees with the party position , they should respond with integrity , identifying the silence or disagreement of the party with their own position .
None of us know it all ( including the know - it - alls ) .
Although I became a self - conscious libertarian 30 years ago , I continue to learn and change some of my positions ( for example , 30 years ago I saw intellectual property protection as essential , and now consider it to be a dangerous monopoly privilege that should be abolished ) .
I ’m not done learning and changing , I hope , and the LP must do a better job of encouraging its members to learn and become better salespeople for liberty .
I believe LP - financed sites to discuss platform issues should be open to non-members : there are too many bright people in the movement who choose not to participate in politics from whom party members can learn .
Voting on formal changes to the LP platform should , of course , be limited to dues - paying members of the LP who have signed the non-aggression pledge .
The Accord is Dead !
Long Live the Accord !

The Best of Less Antman
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama turned his focus to the five - month general - election fight for the White House against Republican John McCain on Wednesday and announced a three - member team to head his search for a running mate .
Obama ’s last remaining Democratic rival , Hillary Clinton , was planning to suspend her campaign and endorse the Illinois senator on Friday , U.S. media reported , after Democratic Party leaders urged her to drop out of the race .
Obama , the first black candidate to lead a major U.S. party into a White House race , began the task of unifying a fractured party the day after clinching the nomination .
McCain proposed that Obama join him for a series of joint summer town - hall meetings around the country .
Obama ’s campaign manager called the idea “ appealing ” but proposed format changes and made no immediate commitment .
Caroline Kennedy , daughter of the late President John Kennedy , will vet prospective Obama running mates along with former deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Jim Johnson , former chief executive of the mortgage lender Fannie Mae , who performed the same task for John Kerry in 2004 and Walter Mondale in 1984 .
Near the top of their agenda will be questions about a possible teaming with Clinton , who has indicated interest in the job after her presidential bid fell short .
“ We ’re going to be having a conversation in coming weeks , ” Obama told reporters when asked about the former first lady and said he was confident the party would be unified to win the general election .
Obama returned to Capitol Hill to a hero ’s welcome from Democrats who swarmed to shake his hand and hug him .
“ Our focus now is on victory in November and on giving Barack Obama every ounce of our support , ” eight previously uncommitted Democratic senators said in a statement .
Democratic leaders urged remaining undecided delegates to the August convention to make up their minds by Friday .
But House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to give any timeline for Clinton ’s to concede .
“ She ’s been through a very long and rigorous campaign , ” she said .
“ She ’s done beautifully .
She has to wind down in her own time . ”
OBAMA AIMS AT MCCAIN
Obama took aim at McCain for his staunch support of the Iraq war during a speech to a pro-Israel lobbying group in Washington , saying the Arizona senator “ refuses to understand or acknowledge the failure of the policy that he would continue . ”

“ He criticizes my willingness to use strong diplomacy , but offers only an alternate reality -- one where the war in Iraq has somehow put Iran on its heels , ” he said .
“ Senator McCain offers a false choice : stay the course in Iraq , or cede the region to Iran . ”
In the same speech , Obama tried to smooth relations with Clinton after their long and sometimes bitter nominating fight , calling her an “ extraordinary candidate and extraordinary public servant . ”
Clinton , in a later speech to the same group , complimented Obama and said she knew he would be a friend to Israel , but offered no signs of when she would end her campaign .
Slideshow ( 24 images )
Clinton ’s supporters turned up the pressure for the New York senator to be named as Obama ’s vice presidential candidate .
Robert Johnson , founder of Black Entertainment Television , said he wrote to the Congressional Black Caucus urging members to push Obama to choose Clinton .
Obama ’s campaign said the search was just beginning .
“ Senator Obama is pleased to have three talented and dedicated individuals managing this rigorous process , ” spokesman Bill Burton said .
“ He will work closely with them in the coming weeks but ultimately this will be his decision and his alone . ”
The victory by Obama , son of a black Kenyan father and white mother from Kansas , marked a milestone in U.S. history .
It came 45 years after the height of the civil rights movement and followed one of the closest and longest nomination fights in recent U.S. political history .
Obama clinched the win after a wave of uncommitted delegates announced their support on Tuesday , pushing his total well past the 2,118 needed to win .
Clinton , who would have been the first woman presidential nominee in U.S. political history , won more than 1,900 delegates .
Obama ’s achievement drew praise from a Republican Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , the highest - ranking black in President George W. Bush ’s Cabinet .
“ It ’s a country that has overcome many , many , now years , decades of , actually a couple of centuries , of trying to make good on its principles , ” Rice said .
“ And I think that what we ’re seeing is , an extraordinary expression of the fact that ‘ we the people , ’ is beginning to mean all of us , ” Rice said , a reference to the opening line of the U.S. Constitution .

Over the last seven years , the lunatic fringe in control of the Republican Party -- the people who believe in torture but do n’t believe in evolution -- have hijacked our democracy , aided and abetted by the news media .
The heart of the problem is not the bias of Fox News or the blowhards on AM talk radio but a mainstream media that has completely internalized how the right frames all political debate .
The right - wing message has become a part of the news media ’s DNA .
The latest confirmation came with this week ’s announcement that Tony Snow , formerly a host at Fox News and press secretary for the White House , where he earned high marks as a gifted purveyor of Bush / Cheney propaganda , would be joining CNN as a commentator .
I guess Karl Rove was too busy with his Newsweek gig and Bill Kristol with his New York Times column .
What ’s next , NPR signing up “ Scooter ” Libby and David Addington ?
Certainly other White House insiders , such as William Safire and George Stephanopoulos , have made the leap to TV and print news .
But this current crop remains unabashed propagandists .
By embracing them , the mainstream media have revealed a mile - wide streak of self - loathing .
Have they been so cowed by the Republicans ’ relentless branding of them as “ liberal ” that they feel compelled to sleep with the enemy ?
Make no mistake , Rove , Kristol and Snow are the enemies of honesty , truth , facts , reality and the public ’s right to know .

Rove ’s commitment to deception is legendary .
His entire career as a GOP shot - caller was built on it .
Kristol , Dan Quayle ’s chief of staff in the first Bush administration , is neoconservatism ’s crown prince .
As editor of the Weekly Standard , he was a prime pusher of invading Iraq , and his claims about the war ’s progress have been discredited again and again .
His reward : a column in Time magazine in 2006 - 07 , and then this year a conservative slot on the Gray Lady ’s Op - Ed page .
The New York Times might as well have given a weekly column to infamous fabricator Jayson Blair .
Now CNN , the self - anointed “ most trusted name in news , ” has thrown its arms around Snow and handed him its international megaphone .
Are the cable network ’s execs suffering from collective amnesia ?
Do they not remember the extremely distant relationship Snow had with the truth during his time as President Bush ’s mouthpiece ?
Because , in the end , the crux of this problem is n’t Snow .
It ’s the people who hired him -- and Kristol and Rove -- and their reasons for doing so .
The prerequisite for any TV pundit is credibility .
Viewers wo n’t agree with every opinion expressed , but they do need to trust that it ’s an honest opinion , not some prepackaged PR line cooked up in the White House to keep us in the dark .
That was always Snow ’s specialty -- along with a dismissive glibness that made him the poster child for the Bush administration ’s brand of Callous Conservatism .

When the U.S. death toll in Iraq hit 2,500 in June 2006 , Snow commemorated the news by saying “ It ’s a number . ”
When it was announced that in order to have enough troops for the “ surge , ” a number of U.S. brigades would have to forgo the customary training in the Mojave Desert , Snow shrugged it off : “ Well , but they can get desert training elsewhere , like in Iraq . ”
Snow regularly displayed a gift for obfuscating rhetoric .
In August 2006 , faced with a rash of bombings and killings that had left 3,400 Iraqi civilians dead , Snow insisted that “ there is not a civil war going on . ”
Instead , he chalked the carnage up to “ a number of sectarian violence operations going on . ”
In December 2006 , trying to put a positive spin on the highly critical Iraq Study Group report , Snow insisted that it agreed with Bush ’s “ goal ” in Iraq .
Reminded that the report found that the president ’s policies in Iraq were “ not working , ” he replied , “ No , what they said is that you need a new policy . ”
And he never let little things like the facts get in the way of his mission .
In September 2006 , just days after a Senate report unequivocally concluded there had been no prewar relationship between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda terrorist Abu Musab Zarqawi , Snow insisted that such a relationship did exist , continuing to falsely link the Iraqi dictator to 9/11 -- evidence be damned .

Misinformation accomplished .
The fanatical right has put a modern media twist on Vladimir Lenin : “ Self - loathing liberals will hand us the microphone with which we will bludgeon them . ”
( CNN ) --
The FBI 's counter - terrorism unit is trying to determine who detonated a small explosive device early Sunday at the federal courthouse in San Diego , California .
A suspected pipe bomb damaged the federal courthouse in downtown San Diego early Sunday .
The bomb , which damaged windows but caused no injuries , went off about 1:40 a.m. ( 4:40 a.m. ET ) , just outside the Edward J. Schwartz Federal Courthouse , the FBI said .
The blast shattered a glass door to the courthouse and broke a window in a building across the street , the bureau reported .
The FBI 's Joint Terrorism Task Force took over the investigation from local authorities after investigators determined the blast was the result of an explosive device .
No claim of responsibility has been issued , said Special Agent Darrell Foxworth , an FBI spokesman .
The streets around the building were blocked off as investigators searched the building , which is near the city 's waterfront .
Watch agents at the scene of the explosion »
But Foxworth told CNN he expects the courthouse to be open for business Monday .
" We 're hoping that we 'll be able to complete our search sometime this morning and have the streets open towards the end of the morning , " he said .
Investigators believe the device was a pipe bomb , he said .
Security personnel were inside the building at the time of the blast , but no one was hurt .
The FBI is checking security cameras at the courthouse and surrounding buildings for evidence , Foxworth said .

McDiet Takes Man From 50 - Inch Waist to 36 Chris Coleson lost 80 pounds by eating at the fast food eatery two times a day .
June 19 , 2008  -- Chris Coleson battled his weight for years , but when he had trouble sliding into a restaurant booth it boosted and fueled his desire to drop the excess pounds .
But rather than try conventional diets , which had failed him before , the then 276 - pound Coleson opted for his own " realistic " solution in December : he 'd only eat at McDonald's .
After six months on his McDiet , Coleson lost 80 pounds and dropped 14 pants sizes .
His waist went from 50 - inches to 36 .
" I did n't make my goal of 185 , but I 've made some great lifestyle choices and I 'll make that goal , " the 42 - year - old said on " Good Morning America today .
Supersized Slim Down
Coleson 's goal was to hit 185 pounds by his wedding anniversary , which is Saturday .
Today he only is five pounds short of the goal .
His weight loss marks several major milestones in his life .
For the first time in seven years , Coleson said he is able to wear his wedding band .
" I put the ring on [ my wife 's ] 40th birthday [ in April ] , " he said .
It helped keep him motivated and so did the thought of his two children , eight - year - old Meghan and six - year - old James .
" I tried to pick small milestones , " Coleson said .
Besides wanting to slimdown to his wedding - day weight , Coleson 's supersized slimdown also was sparked by his family 's history of heart disease .
Heart disease killed his mother at age 62 and his father suffered a major heart attack at age 39 .
" There were nights I 'd go to bed and I worried I was n't going to get up , " said Coleson , who admitted his weight was due to overeating .
" I would literally sit at the refrigerator and just eat out of the refrigerator , " he said .
" I would attack the kids ' school lunches that [ my wife ] had prepared the night before . "
Coleson said he was eating 5,000 calories daily when he was at his heaviest .
When he decided to get in shape he relied on a simple idea : " calories in and calories out — I figured it was a simple principle . "
Starting His McDiet
" I initially thought he was crazy , " said Coleson ' wife Patricia Sumner , on " Good Morning America " today .
But the 40 - year - old came around when she noticed her husband getting slimmer and even tried it out herself .
To date , she 's dropped 30 pounds and someone called her " McFit " at her daughter 's recent softball game .
Coleson lost his weight by regulating his caloric intake to only 1,400 calories a day .
That 's well below what doctor 's would consider safe for a man his size .
Coleson said he was able to lose weight by avoiding the fast food restaurant 's extremely popular French fries .
He said he never had them once .
" I stayed away from the fries , " he said .
What he did eat were the salads and on occasion he would integrate a hamburger patty on one .
" I might break it up and turn into a steak salad , " Coleson said .
The Virginia man also would eat grilled chicken salads and sandwiches , walnut salads , and apple dippers sans the caramel sauce .
" [ The wraps ] were a favorite of mine , " he said .
Though Coleson did say he began to get bored with meal plan until he noticed how well it worked for him .
Coleson regulated his caloric intake to a mere 1,400 calories a day — what most doctors would consider unsafe for a man Coleson 's size .
In fact , Dr. Christine Gerbstadt , a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association , called Coleson 's a " starvation diet . "
Coleson also would skip breakfast on his meal plan and kept daily journal , as well as receipts from his exploit , both to keep himself on track and to prove to others that he had actually lost the weight with McDonald's .
Coleson also began exercising a few times a week , which he was not doing prior to the McDiet .
In fact , he said he used to get winded after climbing four steps .
McDonald 's has not released a statement about Coleson 's triumph , but the company did tell ABC News " We applaud his efforts and his results . "
Today is the last day of his Golden Archathon , which has lasted 200 days .
To celebrate his new look and life Coleson changed his license plate .
The plate used to read " Old N Fat " and now it says " McFit . "
An online colleague at my blog - host , SFN , makes the following observation :
Would n’t it be amusing if science groups started leading tours of the Creation Museum , lead by archeologists pointing out the flaws in their reasoning and why evolution really does answer those questions ?
It would be a great response to that story out of Colorado about creationists leading tours of a natural history museum out there .
I say go for it .
It would be great .
But I expect such a group would likely be EXPELLED from the museum .
A normal tour ( of at least , say , a dozen people ) , with no stealth or rambunctiousness ( i.e. normal speaking voices and doing a reasonable debunking , not trying to get kicked out ) , touring the whole museum , even without PZ Myers hosting it .
I ’ll even pony up 20 bucks as a reward for the first such tour that is allowed to finish , just as incentive ( such as it is ) to be on one ’s best behavior .
Documentation should n’t be too difficult in this , the digital age .
I always wondered just why people bother with a wired cellphone headset .
You 've seen them : one hand to hold the phone , one hand to cram the earpiece into their waxy canal and then the other hand to hold the microphone somewhere near the mouth .
And all the while evil radiation goblins are racing up the wire , directly into the brain .
Hands free ?
No way .
The handphone takes this madness a step further .
Why have one simple , easy to use unit which can simply be held to the head when you can strap a mess of wires onto the back of your hand ?
Take a look at the picture .
How would you dial it ?
And how would you do anything else while wearing it ?
Even the fixings are odd .
Instead of a simple velcro strap ( which seems good enough for both the microphone and speaker ) you have two elastic straps .
One to cut off the blood flow to your middle finger and one to do the same for your wrist .
The handphone is , of course , a concept design .
And will remain so , forever .

You may not remember this because the news came out during CES , but back in January there was a gigantic leak of Windows Mobile 7 details , including an Alaskan Senator 's dump truck full of images .
Brandon from Pocket Now recently got to SEE Windows Mobile 7 at a Microsoft MVP event , and while he thinks it 's a fantastic OS , he 's got a huge problem with the release date .
Advertisement
Based on what he heard at Microsoft , the target release date seems to be mid to late 2009 .
He 's got no problem with the technology in WM7 — he says it basically addresses everything wrong with WM6 today — but the fact that it 's not going to be released until a year and a half from now is troublesome .
How can Microsoft compete when the iPhone will already been out for two and a half years , and iPhone clones have been out for more than one ?
It 's tough .

And it 's not like Microsoft can do anything about it .
After they finish the OS , they have to send it out to OEMs and carriers and third - party companies in order to test and embed and develop on it .
That 's the problem with creating only an OS , instead of making an all - in - one OS and hardware product .
But that 's where Brandon thinks Microsoft has bomb to drop .
There 's a possibility that Microsoft will take the recently acquired Danger ( the makers of the T - Mobile Sidekick ) and put them to work on hardware made expressly for Windows Mobile 7 .
Just think about how well Apple 's done by integrating software onto hardware they built themselves .
The same could be true with Microsoft .

A sculpture of the Flying Spaghetti Monster , the goofball deity cooked up to protest a Kansas legal battle over evolution , went on display outside a courthouse in Cumberland County , Tennessee , late last month .
Ariel and David Safdie created the sculpture , which depicts the taste - tempting god worshiped by adherents of the " Pastafarian " parody religion practiced by the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster .
A statement from the installment ceremony helps explain the Flying Spaghetti Monster 's place in the grand debate about religion , evolution , free speech and noodle dishes :
" We are lucky enough to live in a country that allows us , its citizens , the freedom of speech .
I have chosen to put up a statue of the Flying
Spaghetti Monster to represent the discourse between people of all different beliefs .
The many faiths , ethnicities and backgrounds of
Cumberland County 's residents make our community a stronger richer place ....
The Flying Spaghetti Monster is a pile of noodles and meatballs , but it is meant to open up discussion and provoke thought .
Being able to put up a statue is a celebration of our freedom as Americans ; a freedom to be different , to express those differences , and to do it amongst neighbors – even if it is in a noodley way . "
The artists ' interpretation of the Flying Spaghetti Monster sits alongside an Iraq war memorial , chainsaw - carved monkeys and a sculpture of Jesus carrying a cross , according to the Crossville Chronicle .

( CNN ) --
A blunt new statement attributed to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden urges his followers to liberate Palestine .
The statement 's release coincides with Israel 's 60th anniversary .
This image accompanied a message from Osama bin Laden in November .
In the audio message , the speaker reiterates jihadist opposition to the existence of the Jewish state and its policies , and tells listeners that " liberating " Palestine should be the aim of every Muslim .
The message , titled " The Causes of Conflict on the 60th Anniversary of the State of Israeli Occupation , " was released Thursday on jihadist Web sites , where it is played over a still image .
It runs nine minutes and 40 seconds and is addressed to Western peoples .
A U.S. intelligence official said Friday the tape is being analyzed to see if the speaker is , in fact , bin Laden .
The official said it would be " no surprise " that bin Laden would issue a message against Israel .
Al Qaeda seems to think such a message " resonates well in the Muslim world , " he said .
The official was speaking on background because he was not authorized to speak on the record .
CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the message .

The speaker decries characterization of Palestinian militant groups as terror organizations .
He also says Israel has engaged in terror .
" As your low values show double standards in one issue , you call the Palestinian organizations terror organizations .
They were punished and ignored .
" On the other hand , the Israelis were killing civilians from women and children , either through car bombs as in Haifa and elsewhere .
Or what is worse than that , when the Zionist organizations massacred Palestinian villagers by scaring him , deporting them , and robbing their lands , what was your stance ? "
He singles out Menachem Begin , the late Israeli prime minister , and blames him for the events at Deir Yassin , a Palestinian Arab village where the killings of civilians occurred in 1948 .
" What was the Westerner 's stance on this ?
Instead of being punished for those crimes , he was appointed prime minister .
That was n't enough for them ; they presented him with the Nobel Peace Prize , " he said .
Today , the speaker says , " we are living the massacre of Gaza , " the Palestinian - controlled territory .
Israeli troops and Palestinian militants from Gaza have been fighting and Israeli security moves have had severe humanitarian consequences .
" It is happening in front of the eyes of the world .
One and a half million individuals under the deadly bombing are dying slowly because of poor nutrition and scarcity of medicine , " the speaker said .
" But your politicians require Egypt 's ruler to provision the embargo on them to choke the weak and most of them are women and children . "
The speaker emphasizes the fighting will continue against " the Israelis and their allies , to obtain justice , to be fair to the ones mistreated . "
" We will not abandon one inch of Palestine , God willing , if there is one honest Muslim man left in this world , " the speaker said .
Bin Laden 's last message came on March 20 , when in an audiotape he called Iraq " the perfect base to set up the jihad to liberate Palestine . "
In an audiotape released the previous day , bin Laden condemned European countries for siding with the United States in Afghanistan and for allowing the publication of cartoons considered insulting to Islam 's prophet Mohammed .
Al Qaeda -- which is responsible for the September 11 , 2001 , attack on the United States -- regularly condemns Zionism , the philosophical underpinning of Israel .
President Bush referred to al Qaeda on Friday in an address to Israel 's parliament , the Knesset , in Jerusalem .
He decried the actions and the motivations of terrorists and noted that bin Laden teaches that " the killing of Jews and Americans is one of the biggest duties . "

Venus Express provides first detection of hydroxyl in atmosphere of Venus
15 May 2008
Measurements of airglow emission from planets is an important tool in understanding the chemical and dynamical processes that control the composition and energy balance in the upper atmosphere of planets .
Observations of night - side airglow emission optimises the detection of the weak light that is otherwise swamped by scattered sunlight on the day side of the planet .
Airglow from NO and O 2 ( a - X ) ( 0 - 0 ) has already been detected on Venus .
In the May issue of A&A Picconi et al. report the first detection of hydroxyl ( OH ) in the night - side airglow emission of Venus .
This is the first detection of OH in the atmosphere of a planet other than Earth .
The data were recorded by the VIRTIS instrument , during one orbit of Venus , in March 2007 .
Observations were made in limb mode , which is favourable when searching for faint emission .
The resulting long path length along the line of sight can produce an amplification of the signal of a factor of 50 .
The OH is unambiguously identified in the 1.40 - 1.49 μm and 2.6-3.14 μm bands for the ( 2 - 0 ) and ( 1 - 0 ) transitions respectively .
Identification was made by comparing the observed spectra with synthetic spectra for 200 , 250 and 300 K .
In addition the spectra show O 2 emission at 1.27 and 1.58 μm .
This is the first detection of the latter band in the spectrum of another planet , and the first simultaneous detection of both bands on any planet .
Intensity distributions of the hydroxyl bands appear to be closely correlated with those of the oxygen bands .
While the data are consistent with either of two mechanisms of production involving H , O 3 , O and HO 2 , the authors favour the Bates - Nicolet mechanism .
These results provide the most direct observational constraints to date of these key species in the chemistry of the upper atmosphere of Venus .

BRIMMING with lime - hued succulents and a lush collection of agaves , one shooting spiky leaves 10 feet into the air , it ’s a head - turning garden smack in the middle of Long Beach ’s asphalt jungle .
But the gardener who designed it does n’t want you to know his last name , since his handiwork is n’t exactly legit .
It ’s on a traffic island he commandeered .
“ The city was n’t doing anything with it , and I had a bunch of extra plants , ” says Scott , as we tour the garden , cars whooshing by on both sides of Loynes Drive .
Scott is a guerrilla gardener , a member of a burgeoning movement of green enthusiasts who plant without approval on land that ’s not theirs .
In London , Berlin , Miami , San Francisco and Southern California , these free - range tillers are sowing a new kind of flower power .
In nighttime planting parties or solo “ seed bombing ” runs , they aim to turn neglected public space and vacant lots into floral or food outposts .
Part beautification , part eco-activism , part social outlet , the activity has been fueled by Internet gardening blogs and sites such as GuerrillaGardening.org , where before - and - after photos of the latest “ troop digs ” inspire 45,000 visitors a month to make derelict soil bloom .
“ We can make much more out of the land than how it ’s being used , whether it ’s about creating food or beautifying it , ” says the movement ’s ringleader and GuerrillaGardening.org founder , Richard Reynolds , by phone from his London home .
His tribe includes freelance landscapers like Scott , urban farmers , floral fans and artists .
“ I want to encourage more people to think about land in this way and just get out there and do it , ” says Reynolds , whose new handbook for insurgent planters , “ On Guerrilla Gardening , ” is out this week .
The activists see themselves as 21st century Johnny Appleseeds , harvesting a natural bounty of daffodils or organic green beans from forgotten dirt .
It ’s a step into more self - reliant living in the city , ” says Erik Knutzen , coauthor with his wife , Kelly Coyne , of “ The Urban Homestead ” to be released in June .
The Echo Park couple have chronicled “ pirate farming ” on their blog , Homegrown Evolution .
Guerrilla gardening , Knutzen says , is a reaction to the wasteful use of land , such as vacant lots and sidewalk parkways .
He ’s turned the parkway in front of his home into a vegetable garden .
One of a slew of DIY gardening currents , such as permaculture ( design of highly sustainable ecosystems ) , urban homesteading , composting and free fruit movement , guerrilla gardening is a response to dwindling green space , limited land and suspicions about food sources , say experts .
It ’s also part of a time - honored American tradition of gardening public spaces .
“ It reminds me of the Vacant Lot Cultivation societies , ” says Rose Hayden - Smith , a Food and Society Policy Fellow with UC Cooperative Extension .
In the wake of the economic meltdown of the 1890s , many American cities , from Detroit to Philadelphia and Boston , formed Vacant Lot Cultivation associations to encourage residents to grow food on public land .
The Liberty and Victory garden campaigns of World Wars I and II , respectively , also exhorted Americans to raise food on untended public land .
“ If the federal government was paying attention , they ’d be encouraging this right now , ” with the price of food and fuel , ” adds Hayden - Smith .
“ Guerrilla gardens can serve the same purpose as the Victory gardens , ” says Taylor Arneson , editor of the Los Angeles Permaculture Guild newsletter and a proponent of sustainable food production .
He and a friend raised a farmers market worth of crops -- corn , beans , squash , tomatoes , lettuce , watermelon , cucumber and more -- in a guerrilla dig at a large planter bed in front of an office building on Bundy Drive in West Los Angeles .
Farming in broad daylight , they got support from office workers and kids excited to see real cornstalks .
Arneson ’s approach is to plant first and make arrangements with sympathetic locals to hook up to water taps later .
Keeping a guerrilla garden irrigated is one of the trickiest parts of the game .
Arneson , a graduate student in village - scale permaculture design , says he rules out 99 % of the vacant lots he scouts because they do n’t have a reliable water source .
He looks for some elevation or berm that will let the plants catch water .
After more than a year of growing crops at the Bundy site , he and his friend planned to live on the produce grown there last winter .
They planted garlic , potatoes , radishes , carrots , lettuce , onions and more , but in January the owner of the property , after first leaving a cease and desist letter , rototilled the whole plot .
Property owners who do n’t take kindly to others gardening on their land have laws on their side .
But most freelance growing is done in the nooks and crannies of public land , where the law is murkier .
Spokespersons at the Los Angeles city departments of Public Works , and Recreation and Parks were unaware of laws proscribing citizen gardening in public spaces .
A patch of wildflowers on a city - owned lot would n’t be removed until it dried up and became a fire hazard , according to the city ’s Street Services ’ Lot Cleaning Division .
Back at that median oasis in Long Beach , Scott is making introductions .
“ This is Aloe nobilis .
Put them in the ground and in five years you could turn out 10,000 plants , ” he says .
Scott may not have title to the land , but he tends it as if he did , weeding and pulling out trash -- he ’s found such debris as car parts and condoms in there .
He ’s bummed when he spots a bare patch .
“ It ’s kind of depressing when I see how much work needs to be done , ” says the Norwalk resident , who works for the government .
“ This whole section , there ’s something in the dirt .
This is old landfill and they probably just used that dirt . ”
He built the garden up over a period of years , planting early in the morning to avoid detection .
Police have questioned Scott at his traffic island during early morning plantings , part of the uncertainty that comes with guerrilla gardening .
Several of his unsanctioned gardens along the San Gabriel River have been wrecked by agave thieves , who , he thinks , steal the leaves to make tequila .
“ You just take a deep breath and go back to it , ” he says .
But homeowners in Long Beach have encouraged his work on the median .
Today the garden is a veritable nursery .
He ’s taken out hundreds of plants incubated here , some of which he moves to unapproved gardens he ’s planted and tends in Norwalk and Whittier .
Why does he bother with all the work , expense and dodging authorities ?
“ I ’d like to show cities that they can use plants like these , not have to water as much and cut down on landscaping costs .
Within two to three years , a site like this can generate thousands of plants . ”
Scott sees his Long Beach garden as a showcase for drought - tolerant , low - maintenance city landscaping .
But he ’s in a bind .
How does he broach the subject , given his unsanctioned status ?
“ I wish I could get together with the city , ” he says .
“ But I ’m apprehensive and pretty much keep under the radar . ”
Meanwhile , over at landscaping headquarters for the city of Long Beach , superintendent of grounds maintenance Ramon Arevalo waxes on about one of more than a dozen gardens done by “ road planters , ” as he calls guerrilla gardeners .
“ It ’s like an underwater scene , a cactus garden that looks like a corral reef .
It ’s beautiful .
It ’s been there on Loynes Drive for 10 years , and we do n’t know who did it .
You should see this place ! ”
It ’s Scott ’s garden .
I tell him I have seen it and know the mystery man who planted it .
Arevalo is ecstatic .
“ I ca n’t wait to know him !
He ’s been the talk of this place for 10 years .
He ’s like the 007 of gardening , ” says Arevalo , laughing heartily .
He says a homeowners association has complained that their medians are ugly .
Why ca n’t theirs look like that cactus island ?
Arevalo is impressed by Scott ’s use of drought - tolerant plants and assures there will be no repercussions if he comes forward .
There is no law against planting on city landscaping , except for ficus trees , whose roots wreck roads and sidewalks .
The city discourages unapproved gardening but tries to work with road planters it discovers .
“ If you want to do this , my advice is to contact myself or the council person , ” says Arevalo .
“ We want to partner with people who care about where they live . ”
At a time of shrinking city budgets and skeletal landscaping staffs , it ’s a hint at where guerrilla gardening could go -- to approved brigades of citizen gardeners helping cities turn wasted space into food and flowers .
After years of looking over his shoulder , Scott can come in out of the cold dawn plantings .
He has Arevalo ’s phone number and attention .
“ I ’ll do whatever he wants , ” says Arevalo , chuckling .
“ I want to buy him a coffee . ”

A growing number of communities now use scrip ( aka a community currency or loyalty program ) as a way to keep business activity local and thereby increase community resilience to economic shocks .
Here 's how it works .
Customers buy scrip that can only be used with local businesses to buy goods and services .
This is usually done in response to a community initiative .
Businesses that accept scrip can either pay employees with the same ( to the extent they accept it ) , provide it as change to customers ( again , limited by acceptance ) , or exchange this scrip for hard currency ( usually at a steep discount ) .
Examples of scrip range from the Ithaca HOURS , Berkshares , to the Totnes Pound .
While these attempts at scrip are better than nothing , in almost all cases these efforts have fared about as well as most " green " initiatives :
participation is meager ( it is relegated to a lifestyle choice )
velocity is weak ( low turnover ) ,
it is vulnerable to economic contraction ( when times are tough , participation among retailers falls off due to a scramble for a dwindling amount of hard global currency )
How to Accelerate Scrip
However , despite the spotty record so far , scrip is an extremely powerful means of accelerating local economic activity when nothing else seems possible ( in economic extremis ) .
Past experience with depression era scrip like Austria 's Worgl indicate that the following will accelerate scrip adoption , velocity , and robustness :
Allow community members to use it to pay all or part of their tax liabilities to local governments .
This instantly establishes a market for the currency .
Also , pay local government employees a portion of their wages in scrip .
Deflate the value of the scrip ( optimally , one percent per month ) to promote immediate use rather than hoarding .
To the extent possible , connect scrip to local production rather than retail .
Locally produced food ( farmer 's markets ) , energy ( via local microgrids ) , products ( personal fabs ) , and labor / services .
Further , work with local banks to establish checking accounts for scrip and to enable conversions hard currencies ( at a slight discount ) .
NOTE : Scrip should also be considered to be a part of a 21st century approach to economic development ( likely superior to microcredit ) , ( open source ) counter - insurgency , and disaster / crisis recovery .
For more background read the economist Irving Fisher on depression era scrip .
The rambling utopian tract by Silvio Gesell is also interesting .
Angry and anxious voters tend to tune into the presidential race but their strong emotions might actually distract them from paying attention to the facts .
New findings by researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of Texas examined the emotional state on political - information seeking .
They focused on the impact of negative emotions — fear vs. anger — on interest , information - seeking and learning about politics .
" While strong emotions can enhance attention , they might also interfere with information - seeking by distracting people from the task at hand , " said Nicholas Valentino , a U - T professor and the study 's lead author .
The researchers conducted two experiments in which respondents sought information on the Internet about 2004 presidential candidates John Kerry and George W. Bush .
The people answered questions on a computer that either induced a specific emotional state or a control condition to reduce all emotional arousal .
The first experiment found that anxious , angry and enthusiastic people claimed they were more interested than people in a controlled , relaxed setting in the presidential campaigns and would pay closer attention to the debates .
Anxiety produced the strongest impact on attention .
However , all three emotional states led people to take less time looking for information that was made available to them .
Anger might distract people during complex cognitive tasks , which might make them less likely to seek more information , said Vincent Hutchings , an associate political science professor at U -M .
" So even though people claim to be more interested they are less able to concentrate on the task at hand , " said Hutchings , the study 's co-author .
The second experiment also suggested that typical campaign coverage can trigger powerful emotions which can lead to hasty , uninformed decisions .
The researchers said the findings indicate concern about fear - mongering in politics — which Democrats and Republicans accuse the other party of committing — may be overblown .
" Outrage , perhaps , is more damaging than fear if we hope to foster an informed citizenry , " Valentino said .
The study appears in a recent issue of Political Psychology .
Valentino and Hutchings wrote the report with Antoine Banks and Anne Davis , both U - M political science graduate instructors .

Mr Brown received the Olympic torch at Downing Street on Sunday Prime Minister Gordon Brown will not attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics , Downing Street says .
However , he will be at the closing ceremony when the Olympic baton will be passed to London .
A spokeswoman said Mr Brown had never planned to attend the opening ceremony and was not boycotting the Games .
Number 10 claimed that the Chinese knew Mr Brown would not attend the opening ceremony - but the official state media had reported Mr Brown would be there .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said Number 10 should have made the situation clear in the first place .
He told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight : " Chancellor Merkel in Germany and President Sarkozy in France saying quite specifically that they might not go to the opening ceremony shows that the debate has always been about the opening ceremony .
" So now suddenly to be asked to believe by Number 10 that they never really intended to go in the first place either smacks of a rather odd way of going about things or just downright incompetence . "
Gordon Brown has not performed an Olympic U - turn but , thanks to his and his team 's cack handedness , it looks to the world as if he has
BBC political editor Nick Robinson
Nick Robinson 's blog The Olympics minister Tessa Jowell will represent the UK at the opening in Beijing in August .
Downing Street spokesmen have said in recent months that Mr Brown - who has been under pressure to boycott the Olympics over China 's human rights record - would attend the closing ceremony , without mentioning the opening ceremony
And reporters due to travel with Mr Brown were said to have booked summer holidays on the basis the PM would be going only to the closing ceremony .
However , it appears the Chinese believed that Mr Brown - who has talked of Britain attending " ceremonies " - would be at the setpiece opening ceremony .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The Olympics have always been politically motivated so protests should be accepted Thomas , Guilford On 27 March , at a press conference during France 's President Sarkozy 's visit , he said : " We will not be boycotting the Olympic Games ; Britain will be attending the Olympic Games ceremonies .
" At the same time , the president has said that the Dalai Lama has not called for a boycott of the Olympic Games . "
At his Downing Street news conference on 1 April , Mr Brown said : " I think President Sarkozy said himself that he expected Britain , because we are going to host the next Olympics , to be present at the Olympic ceremonies and I will certainly be there . "
Serious disruption BBC sports editor Mihir Bose said Mr Brown 's decision not to attend the opening ceremony was in keeping with his attitude to China 's Olympics - that he has to do his duty without being seen as a supporter .
The UK needs to be represented at the closing ceremony because London takes over from Beijing as the next Olympic city .
He said Mr Brown was not alone in agonising over how to respond to the worldwide protests surrounding the 2008 Games .
The International Olympic Committee , which has gathered in the Chinese capital , is also wrestling with its strategy , our correspondent added .
The Olympic torch has arrived in San Francisco under tight security for the sixth leg of its round - the - world relay .
The torch 's visit to London was disrupted by anti-China protesters Confusion marked the start of the only North American leg of the relay , as its route was diverted to avoid thousands of protesters .
Crowds of pro-Tibetan and pro-Beijing demonstrators are on the streets , prompting fears of violence .
Shortly before the relay began , police said the route would be cut .
Then the lit torch was carried away from crowds .
Protests have already caused serious disruption to legs of the relay in London and Paris .
In Paris , the torch had to be extinguished three times , while in London there were 37 arrests .
Mr Brown attracted controversy for receiving the Olympic torch outside 10 Downing Street , although he did not hold it .
Most demonstrators are protesting over a security crackdown in Tibet after anti-Chinese unrest .
Tibetan exile groups say Chinese security forces killed dozens of protesters .
Beijing says about 19 people were killed in rioting .

What are these ?
Jimmy Carter has snubbed the lecture circuit cash cow to devote his post - presidential life to brokering peace in the Middle East and fighting disease .
So why is it that so many Americans can't stand him ?
Jonathan Freedland asks him
Funny business , being a former president of the United States .
People still use your old title - you are always Mr President - and there 's the thrill of belonging to the world 's most exclusive club .
Current total membership : three , though a fourth member , George W Bush , will be inducted on January 20 next year .
The man who has been in the club the longest - since his ejection from the White House in 1980 - has also rewritten its rules .
True , there was not much in the way of precedent to guide Jimmy Carter .
Franklyn Roosevelt and John F Kennedy died in office , Lyndon Johnson very soon after leaving it ; Richard Nixon retreated into a kind of private penance .
But if there was a pattern for the post - presidential life , it surely involved the lecture circuit , the corporate boardroom , a dose of charity work and , most visibly , the golf course .
The template was set by Carter 's immediate predecessor , Gerald Ford , and has been honoured since then by George HW Bush .
If the current president departs radically from that pattern , it will be a surprise .
Carter is different .
In what he concedes was " a somewhat weak moment " , he vowed to reporters soon after his defeat by Ronald Reagan - a defeat that , despite the polls foretelling it , came as a terrible shock to Carter - that he would not be treading down the familiar , profit - making route .
" Others have wanted to make a lot of money , " he says of his fellow ex-presidents .
" Which I do n't criticise .
They make enormous sums of money , as has been recently revealed about the former president . "
( He is referring to Bill Clinton , whose joint tax returns with Hillary showed an income of $ 109 m since leaving the White House . )
" That does n't appeal to me , " he says , adding that he gets " a good income " from his book sales .
He 's just completed a 25th , a portrait of his mother Lillian , and announces that " they 've all done quite well , sold hundreds of thousands of copies " .
Carter 's chief output , though , has been in the realm of good works .
The result is the Carter Center , originally a one - man mission , now the employer of 150 people , with a restless , global brief that ranges from ridding the world of " neglected diseases " to monitoring disputed elections - with a little light Middle East peacemaking thrown in .
This is no faceless NGO .
The heart of it is still the personal diplomacy - or ceaseless meddling , according to his enemies - of Carter himself .
This post - presidential work bagged Carter the Nobel Peace prize in 2002 and has led even his critics to call him the most successful ex-incumbent of the White House in American history .
He has devised a new model , the activist ex-presidency , which appears to have inspired , at least partially , Clinton in his global foundation and high - profile effort to combat Aids .
But it also means Carter has deprived himself of the most obvious perk of former office : the cosy , consensual place in public affections reserved for an above - the - fray former statesman .
Eighty - three years old , he should by now be entitled to national treasure status .
Instead , Jimmy Carter remains as controversial a figure today as he was when he sat in the Oval Office .
He is denounced on op - ed pages and in the blogosphere , even as armies of activists regard him as perhaps their most prestigious advocate .
On at least one of the major international questions of our time , he remains a player - and no one ever said that about Jerry Ford .
These past three decades of work - too long to be the twilight of Jimmy Carter - also raise a fascinating question about politics itself : why is it that those slammed , whether for weakness or shabby compromises in office , so often flourish once outside it ?
Why is it that Al Gore was able to become the world 's leading advocate of action on climate change only after he turned his back on electoral politics ?
Why is it that Carter looms larger the further behind him the White House recedes ?
Jimmy Carter cuts a modest figure in person .
He walks with a slight stoop and projects little of the backlit radiance that never seems to leave the most charismatic politicians .
Together with his wife Rosalynn , who is rarely far from his side - he in tweed jacket , she nursing a nice cup of tea and a slice of cake - they could be a couple of vacationing pensioners from rural Georgia , except , of course , for the extensive Secret Service detail hovering close by .
They are on the Welsh borders for the Hay book festival , but they will also make time to stay with friends and do some sightseeing related to Dylan Thomas , whom Carter rates as the greatest poet of the last century .
Later that night , he will prove a smash at Hay , delighting a packed marquee with a fluency , cogency and mastery of detail that is not only mightily impressive in a man of his age , but that the audience cannot help but tacitly contrast with the current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
It helps that Carter 's message is so in tune with liberal , European sensibilities .
In one riff , he offers that the next president would not need 100 days to change America 's image in the world , just " 10 minutes " - the time it would take to deliver an inaugural address that would promise that America " will never again torture a prisoner ... never again attack another country unless our security is directly threatened " , will honour its international agreements and do the right thing on climate change .
Carter 's assessment of his own record in office fits that message .
He took some " revolutionary " steps , he says , and he is proud of them .
" We established human rights as the basis of our foreign policy , whereas in the past our government had been in bed with every dictator on earth if they supported our economic framework .
We normalised diplomatic relations with China .
We brought peace to the Middle East , between Israel and Egypt .
We kept the peace with the Soviet Union .
We told the truth .
We kept our country at peace , we never dropped a bomb , we never launched a missile . "
All of which builds the only leverage Carter says he has : " I have moral authority - as long as I do n't destroy it . "
It also means he carries himself more as a spiritual leader than a political one ; more Desmond Tutu than George Bush Snr .
It helps that Carter is a man of deep faith - he is often described as the first born - again Christian to serve as president , and still teaches a Bible class every Sunday morning in his hometown of Plains , Georgia .
The fact that the Carter Center can legitimately claim to have mediated successfully in a clutch of armed conflicts and to have all but rid the world of the hideous Guinea worm disease - there were 3.6 m cases of it when the Center started work and just 5,000 now - only reinforces the image of a tireless agent for good , even , in one journalist 's description , a " living saint " .
So why is it that so many Americans can't stand him ?
The answer lies partly in the very things that non-American audiences admire .
Where Europeans see a dove , Carter 's detractors see a weak president who delighted a hostile world only too happy for America to walk small .
They associate Carter with America 's humiliation in Iran - thanks to both the 444 days in which 52 US diplomats were held hostage in Ayatollah Khomeini's Tehran and the abortive attempt to rescue them - as well as a stalled economy .
For them , the Carter era represented a crisis of American self - confidence , which took eight years of Reagan 's sunny optimism to restore .
Europeans may warm to Carter 's clear pride in a clean sheet on the use of force - he branded the Iran hostage rescue effort a humanitarian , rather than a military , mission so as to maintain the purity of his record - but too many Americans saw that as wimpishness .
( The contrast with George Bush , revelling in his status as a " war president " , could not be sharper . )
As to Carter 's later work , its very goodness seems to get under many Americans ' skin .
They found him preachy as president , and still do .
The former editor of the New York Times , Joseph Lelyveld , put it succinctly when he wrote last year : " The former president 's peculiar combination of rectitude and starchy pride can be a little irritating , as it was three decades ago when he lectured us on energy independence and then blamed our ' malaise ' on our failure to heed him . "
Even Carter 's prodigious knowledge , his phenomenal recall of data , can count against him .
When Saturday Night Live , America 's weekly satirical TV show , sent up Carter back in the 70s , they would depict him answering questions on a radio phone - in show .
Callers would ask the president about , say , their dodgy boiler : " Now turn the red valve clockwise ... " the president would advise , a micro-managing know - all .
I wonder if all these years of castigation and derision - " the Carter administration " is used as a synonym for failure in the way " the Major government " is deployed here - are partly what drives the former president to keep pushing himself so hard when most men in his position would be heading for the putting green .
Is his work fuelled by the urge to repair his reputation ; is it a quest for redemption ?
" I honestly do n't have that feeling at all , " he says .
For one thing , he rejects the premise of the question .
Though he " ca n't deny " that his ex-presidency has been more of a success than his presidency , he still vigorously defends his term of office .
The motivation for the Carter Center was simple , he says : " We had an unprecedented idea . "
( Like most American politicians , he deploys a royal " we " , probably to avoid the more obvious narcissism of " I " , but still a formulation that suggests an ego in good health ) .
There were desperate problems facing the world and where no one else was acting , where there was a " vacuum " , the Carter Center would step in .
A politician who had struggled to be popular would make a virtue of championing unpopular causes , especially those thoroughly ignored by everyone else .
So Carter works on river blindness or increasing the yield of food grains in Africa - issues which , to a serving politician , would spell " no votes " in capital letters .
Carter rejects the redemption notion for another reason , too .
" I do n't consider it to be a sacrifice to go to Nepal or to talk to Hamas .
It 's exciting , challenging , unpredictable , gratifying , adventurous .
It 's a nice thing to do . "
The only hint the former president gives that there is a connection between his current labours and the fate of his presidency comes when I ask if he'd be doing all this if he had somehow defied the odds and beaten Reagan in 1980 .
" I 've thought about that a good bit , and I do n't think I would have , " he says .
Is that because he would have regarded his work as complete after two full terms , that he would have felt fulfilled ?
No .
It 's because " if I 'd had another term , peace in the Middle East would have become permanent .
That 's my honest opinion .
It would have been done " .
And therefore that part of the Carter post - presidential workload - acting as unofficial would - be peacemaker between Israel and the Arab world - would not have been necessary .
We have come to the most vexed aspect of Carter 's current role in the world , the activism that ensures he remains a focus of anger and political contention rather than warm - bath , humanitarian consensus .
In 2007 , Carter authored a polemic titled , without punctuation , Palestine Peace Not Apartheid , thereby becoming the weightiest world figure ever to have made the comparison between Israel and apartheid South Africa .
For many pro-Palestinian campaigners , it was a relief to hear , at last , a mainstream American figure speak so robustly about the plight of those living under occupation , recently denouncing , for example , the " imprisonment " of the people of Gaza was " one of the greatest human rights crimes on earth " .
But , once again , the reaction to Carter in the US is rather different .
The apartheid comparison was seen by many as a step too far , conferring on Israel an illegitimacy that is somehow final , as if it could be remedied only by Israel 's dissolution , much like the South African regime 's in 1994 .
In our interview , Carter was at pains to clarify that the book title refers not to Israel itself - in which Palestinians are citizens , have the vote and so on - but solely to the Palestine of the occupied territories .
Curiously , the book does not seek to make a full case even for this limited use of the apartheid analogy , discussing it in only four paragraphs across the whole text .
Some critics reckon Carter deployed the " a " word solely to ...# 8594 ; ensure attention for his book .
If so , it certainly worked , offering yet another proof that Carter , for all the remarkable good works , remains a politician , one who , in his day , knew how to throw a punch .
But the book confirmed the suspicions that many Israelis and Jewish Americans had long harboured against Carter : that though he might say all the right things - condemning suicide bombings against Israeli civilians , insisting that his primary aim in 32 years of Middle Eastern engagement has been " to bring security and peace to Israel " - he feels genuine compassion for only one of the two sides .
Other , more neutral observers say he remains too credulous in all spheres , and especially when it comes to those who mean Israel great harm .
All this came to a head in April , when Carter embarked on a round of high - profile shuttle diplomacy , meeting Syria 's president and , more controversially , the leadership of Hamas , an organisation proscribed as terrorist not only by Israel but by the US and EU , too .
He was roundly condemned at home , even by leading Democrats , and when he got to Israel , bearing messages from those he had met , no frontline politician would so much as meet him .
The liberal Haaretz newspaper , which argued that Carter should be treated like " royalty " simply for having negotiated the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt that did more than any other event in the country 's history to secure Israel 's place in the region , was a lone voice .
Had the former president seen , either in Syria 's Bashar al - Assad or the Hamas leaders , what he had seen 30 years ago in Egypt 's Anwar Sadat - a man ready to make peace with Israel ?
His answer goes some way to explaining why Carter still infuriates his detractors .
" I did n't see it , but I saw the potential of it , " he says , describing hours of talks that went late into the night .
" The head of Hamas , Khaled Mashal , is a physicist , highly educated .
Obviously shrewd politically , since he orchestrated a very successful campaign with a glorious victory in 2006 .
The deputy head of the politburo is a cardiologist , distinguished in his field ...
There are physicists , medical doctors and others who have also shown political acumen , competence and boldness and have within them the capability ... to make an option of peace . "
Note that Carter does not simply say that Hamas have an electoral mandate , that they represent part of the Palestinian people and therefore have to be engaged with .
He goes further , praising them , speaking of their " glorious " election victory or suggesting their backgrounds in medicine makes them men of peace ( thereby giving his enemies an easy shot , as they point out that , for example , Ayman al - Zawahiri , deputy to Osama bin Laden , is himself an eye surgeon ) .
When the former president praises Assad 's " intelligence , competence and strength " or speaks of Hamas 's " superb " record in municipal government , he walks into the same trap : he is no longer making the case for dialogue with Assad and Hamas .
He is making the case for Assad and Hamas .
Carter is aware of this danger .
I ask whether he detects an in - the - gut conversion to the path of peace in the Hamas leaders he met : " I do , but I may be naive and I may be mistaken . "
What about Hamas 's founding charter , replete with antisemitic imagery , some of it drawn from the notorious Tsarist forgery , the Protocols of the Elders of Zion ?
" It 's terrible , " he says .
" I despise antisemitism in anyone .
I think anti-Jew is a violation of the basic principles on which my life is built .
I grew up with it in the south with anti-black , so I saw the ravages of racial discrimination . "
But when the charter was raised in those talks with Hamas 's top echelon : " They ridiculed it as being ancient , passé , an inconsequential document .
But I do n't speak for anyone else . "
Carter 's mission to Hamas also badly discomforted Barack Obama .
When we met , the primary process was still unfolding and the former president had made no formal endorsement of a Democratic candidate , but he had left pretty heavy hints that he favoured Obama .
So when Carter went to Damascus , Obama was forced to distance himself .
" It gave [ John ] McCain a stick to beat Obama , " one senior Democrat told me .
" Some help . "
That same Democrat sees it as part of an ingrained Carter habit .
" He is indifferent to political timing , part of his self - image as holy man , but often undermining the causes he pursues . "
That , and the lingering association with defeat , mean Carter does not quite enjoy the party elder status among Democrats that you might expect of a former president .
At Bill Clinton 's second nominating convention in 1996 , for example , Carter was not even present , still less an honoured guest .
But his words still make news .
He tells me that he believes that " inherently , John McCain is a more warlike leader than George W Bush " .
McCain would be better than the current president on issues of torture and climate change , but , says Carter , " He has even said in an offhand but I think sincere way that ...
American troops might be [ in Iraq ] 100 years from now .
I do n't think Bush has gone that far .
And I do n't think Bush has taken any step - in going into Iraq or staying there or increasing the number of our troops - where McCain did n't say he should have done more . "
Carter gives a backhanded compliment to the Clintons when he says Obama has been " greatly strengthened ... as a campaigner because he's had to face Bill and Hillary Clinton . "
He 's been " battle - hardened " .
What , then , of an Obama - Clinton dream ticket ?
" It would be the worst mistake that could be made .
That would just accumulate the negative aspects of both candidates . "
He cites the polls showing 50 % of US voters with a negative view of Clinton .
" If you take that 50 % who just do n't want to vote for Clinton and add it to whatever element there might be who do n't think Obama is white enough or old enough or experienced enough or because he's got a middle name that sounds Arab , you could have the worst of both worlds . "
Has he been disappointed by the hardball campaigning of his fellow ex -Prez , Bill Clinton ?
" I think it has hurt him , " he says , volunteering as evidence Clinton 's comparison of Obama 's victory in the South Carolina primary to that of Jesse Jackson in 1988 , which many took to be an attempt to cast Obama narrowly as the black candidate .
" The next day Bill Clinton called me and told me that was not his intention and I believed him .
I do n't think he deliberately meant to make a racist remark . "
But having equated Obama to Jackson , says Carter , it was obvious that Clinton 's words would be interpreted that way .
Has it caused long - term damage to Clinton 's reputation , even in the eyes of history ?
" It may have . "
Obama supporters will cheer that ; Clintonites will see it as typical Carter sanctimony .
Division and argument still follow Carter , even into his ninth decade .
Will he be given a role befitting his status at the Democratic convention in Denver in August ?
The answer to that will tell us much about the current standing of this former US president - and quite a lot about the person who would succeed him .
Spraying your lawn to get rid of pesky weeds may be killing off more than just the plants .
A new study found that the common herbicide atrazine disrupts organ development in tadpoles , resulting in deformed hearts as well as malfunctioning kidneys and intestinal tracts .
When tadpoles were exposed to high levels of atrazine , more than half developed smaller hearts .
By contrast , only 2 percent to 3 percent of the tadpoles not exposed to the chemical had abnormal hearts .
The findings were detailed in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives in February .
The study was funded by a Tufts University internal grant .
Atrazine works as an herbicide by blocking photosynthesis in plants , but scientists do not know why or how it harms organ development in tadpoles .
This is not the first time atrazine has been implicated as a toxin to amphibians .
In 2003 , research led by Tyrone Hayes at the University of California , Berkeley , found that atrazine affected sex development in frogs , essentially emasculating the males .
Unlike Hayes ’s research , which focused on how atrazine affected adult amphibians , the new study , led by Kelly McLaughlin at Tufts University , focused on the middle stage — after very early development , but before the tadpoles became adults .
“ For anything that ’s going to be introduced into the environment , we have to make sure we look at the effects across all development stages , ” McLaughlin said .
The next step , McLaughlin said , is to figure out exactly how atrazine disrupts organ development and to study the effects of lower doses over a longer period of time .
Former soldier arrested for kidnap after his citizen 's arrest on yob who pelted his home with eggs
Frank McCourt :
He says he has been ' put through months of hell '
When Frank McCourt 's home was targeted by young hooligans hurling rocks and eggs , he challenged them and told them to leave and never return .
But the next day they came back so Mr McCourt , a former soldier , tried to phone the police but was put on hold for 45 minutes .
At the end of his tether , he grabbed one of the louts by the arm and hauled him inside , telling him he was performing a citizen 's arrest .
But it was Mr McCourt who was arrested later that day - for kidnap .
The 57 - year - old spent six weeks on bail before being charged with the lesser offence of assault .
The case hung over him for two and a half months before it was dropped just days before the trial when prosecutors accepted there was no realistic prospect of convicting him .
Yesterday , Mr McCourt , a delivery driver who spent 12 years in the Army , said : ' It 's utterly disgraceful that something like this can happen in this day and age .
' Gangs of hooligans who are barely out of short trousers can roam the streets unchecked , causing misery for entire neighbourhoods - and if you try and stand in their way , you end up in the dock .
' Those children have got away scot - free .
They are the criminals of the future and they 've been given the green light to carry on as they were , while I 've been put through three months of hell . '
The trouble started on the evening of February 17 when Mr McCourt and his wife Maria heard a bang on the window of their £ 170,000 semi- detached home in Crawley , West Sussex .
Mr McCourt went outside to find two boys ' of about 11 ' throwing stones , mud and eggs at houses .
He reprimanded them and told them not to come back .
Trouble : Mr McCourt 's street in Crawley , West Sussex
But when he returned from work the next day , he found his wife in tears .
He said : ' She was absolutely terrified .
She told me a gang of kids had been throwing things at the house all afternoon , and shouting all the names under the sun at her . '
When they came back later , Mr McCourt called the police on their anti-social behaviour hotline but could n't get an answer despite holding for three - quarters of an hour .
He went out to look for a community support officer but could n't find one .
At his wit 's end , Mr McCourt grabbed one of the louts , led him into his house and demanded to know the boy 's name , his mother 's name and her phone number .
While he was trying to call the boy 's mother , she turned up banging on the door , shouting and swearing .
He said : ' She said she did n't want me manhandling her son .
I said if she 'd brought him up properly , I would n't have to . '
Mr McCourt let the child go but minutes later police arrived and arrested him on suspicion of kidnapping .
He remained on bail until April 3 , when officers told him they would issue a caution .
But Mr McCourt refused to accept it , because doing so would be an admission of guilt .
He was charged with assault and a date was set for trial but the case was later dropped .
His MP Laura Moffatt , who took up the matter with police , said : ' Thankfully , common sense won the day .
This family has suffered a horrendous level of intimidation from anti-social youths . '
A Sussex police spokesman said : ' An allegation was made and officers duly investigated the facts reported to police .
A file was presented to the Crown Prosecution Service in accordance with procedure . '
Roughly one - fifth of all U.S. households are disconnected from the Internet and have never used e-mail , according to research firm Parks Associates .
A recent phone survey of U.S. households by Parks found 20 million households are without Internet access , approximately 18 percent of all U.S. households .
" Nearly one out of three household heads has never used a computer to create a document , " said John Barrett , director of research at Parks Associates , in a statement .
" These data underscore the significant digital divide between the connected majority and the homes in the unconnected minority that rarely , if ever , use a computer . "
Age and education are factors in this divide , Park found .
One - half of those who have never used e-mail are over 65 , and 56 percent had no schooling beyond high school .
Parks found 7 percent of the 20 million disconnected homes plan to subscribe to an Internet service within the next 12 months .
In 2006 , Parks found that 29 percent of all U.S. households -- 31 million homes -- did not have Internet access , citing low perceived value of the Internet .
" Many people just do n't see a reason to use computers and do not associate technology with the needs and demands of their daily lives , " Barrett said .
This story , " 20 % of U.S. Has Never Sent E- mail " was originally published by Network World .

I think I 've mentioned before that I 'm going through a Tudor phase right now ...
OK , I have been for the past couple of years .
Ever since I read The Other Boleyn Girl , I just can't get enough .
However , after reading about Henry VIII 's " remedies " for his numerous ailments , I think I may have finally reached my limit .
The Quick 10 : 10 Remedies King Henry VIII Tried That You Probably Want to Avoid
1. Asthma : Swallow
Young frogs or live spiders coated in butter .
Protein , I guess , but I fail to see how it would help your breathing .
I may suggest this to my asthmatic husband , though .
2. Gout : Boil a red - haired dog in oil , add worms and marrow from pig bones .
Apply .
My red - haired dog just arched his eyebrows at me .
3 . Headache : Rub the forehead with a rope used to hang a criminal .
Hey , I 've had some headaches so bad that I would have tried anything to make it go away .
4. Rheumatism : Wear the skin of a donkey .
5. Jaundice : Drink a pint of ale containing nine drowned head lice every morning for a week .
I 'd be willing to try that , minus the lice .
6. Bubonic plague : Hold a live chicken against the sores until the bird dies .
How , exactly , do you hold a live chicken still until it dies ??
7 . Whooping cough :
Find a ferret , feed it with milk , then give the leftover milk to the sick child .
8. Warts :
Lay half a mouse on the wart for half an hour and then bury it in the ground .
As the mouse rots , the wart will vanish .
The question , obviously , is which half ?
9 . Baldness : Rub dog or horse urine into the scalp .
You know , this might be one of the saner baldness remedies I 've heard of .
10 . Deafness :
Mix the gallstone of a hare and the grease of a fox , warm the result and place it in the ear .
... What is the " grease " of a fox ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warren Buffett , the famed U.S. investor who heads Berkshire Hathaway Inc , replaced his friend and Microsoft Corp founder Bill Gates as the richest man in the world , Forbes magazine said on Wednesday .
Warren Buffett , chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , listens to a question during testimony at a Senate Finance Committee hearing about " Federal Estate Tax : Uncertainty in Planning Under the Current Law " on Capitol Hill in Washington , November 14 , 2007 .
Buffett , the famed U.S. investor who heads Berkshire Hathaway Inc , replaced his friend and Microsoft Corp founder Bill Gates as the richest man in the world , Forbes magazine said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
The magazine estimated Buffett ’s worth at $ 62 billion in its annual ranking of the world ’s wealthiest people .
Mexican telecoms tycoon Carlos Slim came in second with an estimated worth of $ 60 billion , pushing Gates to third place after 13 years of holding the No. 1 spot .
The magazine estimated Gates ’ worth at $ 58 billion .
Buffett ’s rise to No. 1 was particularly noteworthy , Forbes said , as it came at a time of great financial turmoil and as Buffett has begun to siphon off part of his fortune to charity .
“ Even though he is giving away a piece of his fortune each year , the stock of Berkshire Hathaway , the source of Warren Buffet ’s wealth , has been rising very rapidly , ” Chief Executive of Forbes Magazines Steve Forbes said , noting Buffett ’s fortune climbed $ 10 billion in the last calendar year .
Buffett in June 2006 announced plans to give 85 percent of his fortune away , granting it to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities .
Bill Gates serves on the board of directors of Berkshire Hathaway and is a long - time bridge buddy of Buffett’s .
Gates has also given a substantial amount of his fortune to the foundation .
Buffett , often called the Sage of Omaha , has been lauded among investors for his preference for investing in larger companies with easy - to - understand businesses , large or dominant market shares , consistent earnings , and strong management .
In the early 1960s , Buffett started to invest in Berkshire , then a struggling textile maker , and took it over in 1965 .
Since then , he has transformed it into a holding company for more than 50 companies , ranging from Benjamin Moore paint and Dairy Queen ice cream to Fruit of the Loom underwear and Ginsu knives .
Gates has held the No. 1 spot since 1995 , when he unseated Yoshiaki Tsutsumi , a Japanese real estate tycoon .
Tsutsumi fell off the billionaire ’s list last year after receiving a suspended prison sentence for falsifying financial statements and insider trading in 2005 .
Slim , a former stock market trader , is known for buying up struggling , cheap firms and turning them into profitable cash cows .
He built his fortune by privatizing former Mexican state telephone monopoly Telmex .
America Movil , a Telmex spin - off , is now Slim ’s flagship business and Latin America ’s biggest mobile phone company .
KEEPING UP WITH THE RUSSIANS ?
The collective net worth of the world ’s 1,125 billionaires soared to $ 4.4 trillion , the magazine said .
The list of billionaires has almost doubled in the past four years , Forbes said .
There were 469 U.S. billionaires , worth a combined $ 1.6 trillion , while the 656 billionaires who live outside the United States are worth $ 2.8 trillion .
Russia came in second place as home to 87 billionaires and Moscow is now the world ’s billionaire center , the magazine said .
The Russian capital is now home to more billionaires than New York City .
India , China and Turkey also saw large gains in numbers of billionaires .
The world ’s youngest billionaire is 23 - year - old Mark Zuckerberg , founder of social networking Web site Facebook .
The magazine estimated his worth at $ 1.5 billion and said he is the youngest self - made billionaire to ever appear in the Forbes billionaire rankings .
Recent turmoil in the financial markets has taken its toll on the list .
James Cayne , Chairman of investment bank Bear Stearns Cos ; William Pulte , who founded U.S. home builder Pulte Homes Inc ; and Howard Schultz , founder of coffee chain Starbucks all fell off the billionaire ’s list amid declines in their companies ’ stock prices .
The decline in the dollar , a trend that Buffett himself has been betting on since 2002 , provided a boost to billionaires outside the United States , particularly because the Forbes list is tabulated in U.S. dollars .
The full list of billionaires is available at ( www.forbes.com/billionaires).
Glenn sez ,
I was just alerted that the House of Reps has passed HR 4279 , with the lovely name , PRO - IP ( Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008 ) .
Like the doublespeak PATRIOT Act and Peacekeeper missiles , PRO - IP puts local law enforcement in a position to demand the forfeiture in criminal proceedings of stuff used to violate copyright .
Which means that instead of the RIAA simply trying to collect fines , they can also incite local authorities to collect all the computers and related gear that was used to pirate .
This is n't a judgment on my part as to whether piracy is good or bad ( I think copyright deserves to be protected through reasonable methods ) , but I am always horrified when civil enforcement morphs into criminal enforcement .
Conservatives and liberals should be up in arms alike that local prosecutors and / or police could intervene as they desire in essentially a private affair arranged by the RIAA , and permanently seize thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in private property in addition to any civil penalties .
If this bill is passed in its present form by the Senate and signed , that means there 's no more pro forma RIAA lawsuit payoffs , because if you wind up settling with the RIAA , you could still lose all your stuff in addition to any fee you paid them .
This is particularly irksome in light of the MSN Music shutdown , about which the EFF has written a strong and powerful letter .
It is increasingly likely a normal person could have purchased music legally from an online site , burned it to an ordinary audio CD , and in the right set of circumstances be branded a pirate because the original " granting " authority no longer exists to prove that the consumer was a legitimate purchasers .
The more the law is constructed to sweep in folks who are absolutely observant of it , the more we need broader protections .

WARNING : This is not a recommendation to buy , sell or hold any financial instrument .
Before I begin , I want to emphasize that this market is for experts only .
Unless you trade for a living , I would n’t go near this either way .
Oil has formed a bullish engulfing candle formation on the weekly chart .
It has also broken out of its previous range and closed at a fresh record high .
On their own , these are very bullish developments .
While the weekly stochastic remains in extreme overbought territory , price levels trump oscillators .
Oil strategies should favor long positions ABOVE about $ 135.20 as long as you remember the state of the weekly stochastic .
Below $ 135.20 , consider shorts again , with the premise being that a full oscillation down could be due .
Shorts must be managed carefully , as they are countertrend and very vulnerable to squeezes / reversals like we saw today .
Consider a straddle if it retries $ 135 .
NEAR TERM : VERY VOLATILE , DO NOT EXPECT SMOOTH SAILING HIGHER ON OIL FROM HERE .
The oil story is being driven by several factors , however , the dollar is the most critical of these .
Note below that the U.S. Dollar Index is still range bound .
There are two supports directly ahead for the dollar , around 71.90 and 71.40 ( see chart below ) .
INTERMEDIATE TERM : ABOVE $ 135 , BULLISH ; STRONG CORRECTION POSSIBLE BELOW $ 135 .
The uptrend is very much intact .
If the dollar does not find support between present levels and 71.40 , oil will be headed higher .
My strategic positioning on the dollar is bearish , regardless of the shorter term , countertrend cranks we ’ve been seeing .
I rarely include fundamental analysis in my technical work , but today ’s move on oil was so unusual that I went looking for an “ event . ”
Extreme oil moves are usually driven by supply disruption events , but that was n’t the case today .
What single event was potentially behind the largest gap higher in oil prices — ever ?
On June 5 , 2008 at 5:38 p.m. the Wall Street Journal published a piece about the Ambac and MBIA credit rating downgrades ( Cryptogon post here ) .
While the news was circulating before this , I ’m using this story as the benchmark .
I ’ve indicated the release of that news on four hour charts of West Texas Intermediate crude oil , spot gold and EUR / USD .
I also indicated the news on the U.S. Dollar Index daily interval chart .
A lot of people are saying a lot of things about oil right now .
Nobody , as far as I ’ve seen , has drawn an arrow on an intraday oil chart indicating what happened after something like one trillion dollars worth of debt was downgraded in one fell swoop .
I emphasized the point by including several other dollar affected assets .
What do you see ?
I see dollars trying to hide in many different places , all at once .

recently , I ’ve discovered the power of python for numerical computing .
being a slave of matlab for many years , I ’ve decided to give python ( and it ’s numerical module numpy ) a try , comparing its numerical crounching capabilities versus matlab’s .
the tests are heavily insipired by Prabhu Ramachandran .
I ’ve only added matlab to complete his comparisons .
Here is a short description of the test , taken from here :
The example we will consider is a very simple ( read , trivial ) case of solving the 2D Laplace equation using an iterative finite difference scheme ( four point averaging , Gauss - Seidel or Gauss - Jordan ) .
The formal specification of the problem is as follows .
We are required to solve for some unknown function u( x , y ) such that
abla ^2 u = 0 with a boundary condition specified .
For convenience the domain of interest is considered to be a rectangle and the boundary values at the sides of this rectangle are given .
all the tests have been run on a Pentium IV Xeon 2GHz , with 1 Gb of RAM .
here is the matlab script I used laplace .m ( it ’s a doc file : sorry for that , but I ’m only allowed to upload docs and images on this blog ) .
matlab and numpy have pretty much the same performances .
any form of optimization on python code does better than matlab .
only the simple python ( without numpy ) is slower than matlab ( note the logarithmic y scale to fit also the “ slow ” algorithm ) .
blitz is roughly twice as fast as matlab .
inline , fastinline , fortran and pyrex only differ appreciably for small grids : for 500×500 grids they are around 10 x faster than matlab .
here is some other digits , not included in the graphs :
numpy with psyco runs 5 % faster than numpy alone ;
weave and psyco ( blitz , inline and fastinline ) fails with following polite error : local variables of functions run by Psyco cannot be accessed in any way , sorry ;
octave runs twice as slow as numpy and matlab .
pretty amazing , if you think that optimizing python , most of the time , is really trivial .
moreover , python is free and easily parallelizable with MPI ( I ’ll show some performances in a future post ) .
tests have been run also on an SGI Altix with Itanium2 processors , on a single CPU .
the graphs are reported in the following thumbnails .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers who used cloned embryonic stem cells to treat Parkinson ’s disease in mice said on Sunday they worked better than other cells .
The researchers were trying to prove that it is possible to make embryonic stem cells using cloning technology and use them to provide a tailor - made treatment .
But they found that a mouse ’s own cloned stem cells were far less disruptive to its body than cloned cells taken from other mice .
“ It demonstrated what we suspected all along -- that genetically matched tissue works better , ” said Viviane Tabar of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Institute in New York , who worked on the study .
“ When you give the other type of tissue , non-autologous tissue , you get more inflammation than we anticipated .
This is in a lab animal where we expect it to be tolerant .
Normally when you do this in mice , you do n’t give matched cells , ” Tabar added in a telephone interview .
The mice given non-matched brain cells did more poorly than the mice given cells from their own clones , the researchers reported in the journal Nature Medicine .
Stem cells are the master cells of the body and embryonic stem cells are the ultimate master cells , giving rise to all the other cells and tissue .
Cloning researchers hope one day to be able to take a little piece of skin and grow embryonic stem cells from it for personal , tailor - made medical treatments .
One disease always named that may benefit from this technology is Parkinson’s .
The incurable , fatal illness is caused by the destruction of specific brain cells .
THERAPEUTIC CLONING
It is sometimes treated with transplants of brain cells from cadavers or aborted fetuses .
Stem cell researchers have argued that cloning technology might provide a better source of cells for treatment .
Tabar and his team first created a Parkinson ’s - like disease in mice using chemicals to destroy their brain cells .
They took ordinary cells from the tails of the mice , transferred the nuclei from them into hollowed - out mouse eggs cells , and made clones of the mice .
This process is called somatic cell nuclear transfer , or “ therapeutic cloning ” .
The cloned embryos were harvested for their stem cells after a few days .
The researchers grew these in the lab and coaxed them into becoming the so - called dopaminergic brains cells that are lost in Parkinson’s .
They put these into the brains of the injured mice .
These mice got better , Tabar said .
No one has done this before .
“ It ’s incredibly hard and it involves a series of inefficient steps , ” Tabar said .
Several researchers have made cells that look and act like embryonic stem cells by reprogramming their genes .
Tabar said her team would try using these so - called induced pluripotent stem cells in the same way .
Some people oppose using cloning technology to make human embryonic stem cells , or to creating human embryos for this purpose .
It is also difficult to obtain human egg cells .
Scientists hope the induced pluripotent stem cells might provide a short cut that no one would object to .
“ This is an exciting step down the pathway of creating a self - specific stem cell and getting away from the ethical demands of traditional embryonic stem cells , ” said Richard Boyd , Deputy Director of the Monash Immunology and Stem Cell Laboratories in Victoria , Australia .
As the cost of putting a tiger in the tank keeps going up , drivers are opting for a smaller cat under the hood .
Small - car sales have been a rare pocket of strength for the slumping auto industry in recent months as Americans sought relief from sky - high gasoline prices .
But many buyers are sticking with mid-size or larger vehicles and choosing a smaller engine instead -- saving money on the sticker price and at the pump without downsizing their ride .
“ Some consumers have been moving down to smaller vehicles , but many ca n’t do that -- people with families , people who have to drive the soccer team to practice , ” noted Eric Noble , president of Car Lab , an automotive consulting firm in Orange .
“ So their preferred alternative is to get a vehicle with a smaller engine . ”
For much of May , as gas prices zoomed toward $ 4 a gallon , more than three - fourths of the mid-size cars sold in the U.S. were powered by four - cylinder rather than six - cylinder engines , according to J.D. Power & Associates .

That ’s the largest sector of the auto market and includes such popular models as the Toyota Camry , the Honda Accord , the Ford Fusion and the Chevy Malibu .
Five years ago , barely half of mid-size cars were being sold with four - cylinder engines .
Across all types of passenger vehicles , four - cylinder engines accounted for more than 45 % of sales during the same period .
That ’s up from around 30 % five years ago and signals a reversal -- at least for now -- of the traditional American fondness for ever - bigger engines .
“ We ’ve seen this movement for quite a while , but it appears to be accelerating , ” J.D. Power analyst Tom Libby said .
“ It ’s pretty amazing to think about it -- almost every other vehicle sold has a four - cylinder in it . ”
And it ’s not just cars .
Ford Motor Co. , for instance , is seeing a jump in the ratio of four - cylinder Ranger pickups it is selling versus six - cylinder versions , and the automaker is expecting increased demand for the four - cylinder version of the 2009 Escape sport utility vehicle when it goes into production next month .

Savings are a big reason for the shift .
In the mid-size car category , for example , the four - cylinder Ford Fusion gets combined city - highway fuel economy of 23 miles per gallon , compared with 21 for the six - cylinder -- a 10 % improvement .
And the Fusion four - banger lists for about $ 1,500 less than a comparable V6 , noted Brian Allan , general manager of Galpin Motors in Van Nuys , although some of the price difference has to do with option packages tied to engine size .
That traditional price break for a four - cylinder may shrink .
General Motors Corp.'s marketing chief , Mark LaNeve , said this week that consumers ’ growing preference for four - cylinder engines raises the question of whether they should be priced more closely to six - cylinder versions .
Beyond the cost savings , a big factor in the rising popularity of four - cylinder engines is a simple matter of engineering .
Automakers have improved smaller engines to the point that they ’ve shed at least some of the “ putt - putt ” image that dogged them in the past .
Jim Porter of Ontario , who bought a four - cylinder Fusion in January , was surprised “ at the amount of pep this engine has . ”
Some cars with smaller engines can’t “ get out of their own shadow , ” he said , but that has n’t been the case with the Fusion .

Fuel economy that approaches 30 mpg on the freeway is a bonus , said Porter , who drove to Reno and back on a single tank of gas each way .
“ There used to be more of a stigma attached to going with a four - cylinder because there truly was a big difference in performance , ” Allan said .
“ But the four - cylinder of today gives better performance than the six - cylinder of yesterday . ”
A 1997 six - cylinder Honda Accord , for instance , produced 170 horsepower and got EPA combined mileage of 19 mpg .
A 2008 Accord with a four - cylinder engine produces 190 horsepower and gets 24 mpg .
One reason for the improved performance is automakers ’ increasing use of turbochargers , which can boost engine power while cutting fuel consumption .
Research into how to improve small engines has been a preoccupation at car companies in recent years , said Noble of Car Lab .
Advertisement
The swerve by consumers toward smaller engines “ is a big relief for auto manufacturers , ” he said .
“ They have their test labs full of four - cylinder engines that they plan to bring out in the next five to six years with the idea that they would be replacing six - cylinder engines . ”
If history is any guide , the popularity of those smaller , more fuel - efficient engines will greatly depend on the direction of oil prices .
Crude oil has slipped in recent days , but as of Friday , regular gasoline was selling at record prices in California ( $ 4.198 a gallon ) and nationwide ( $ 3.962 ) , according to AAA .
During past price shocks , such as in the mid- and late 1970s , consumers switched to smaller cars and smaller engines , only to jump back into SUVs and pickups when pump prices retreated .
“ Whether this is a permanent shift to four - cylinder engines and smaller vehicles , we ’re not able to say , ” Libby of J.D. Power said .
“ We ’ll have to wait and see . ”

Will on # geekup has been working on a
Countdown
letters and numbers game
solver written in Python .
I thought it'd be fun to try to do it in Haskell ,
and started with the letters game ( anagram ) solver .
Starting with a string of jumbled letters , the goal is to make the longest possible
anagram .
I remember the first time I tried to solve anagrams I jumped into the
problem without thinking and got mixed up in all kinds of complicated combinatorial
mess .
The actual answer is very simple : let 's take two words which are anagrams of
each other :
monad
nomad
Both of them contain the same letters , so they are identical in some form of " canonical
representation " , for example
{ a:1 , d:1 , m:1 , n:1 , o:1} — dictionary mapping letter to number of times used
— dictionary mapping letter to number of times used " admno " — a string with the letters sorted
So we just need to consider all the subsets of the original jumbled letters in turn , and
compare them against a map of : : canonical representation -> [ list of words ] .
So for example :
pmqnrdzoa
...
m n d oa
...
This function is called a powerset .
I 'm lazy so I googled
a definition .
We want the longest words first .
The definition of powerset I found does a
depth first search so it 's not in order of length .
What we want to do
is to work on a list like this
list s =
sortBy ( flip $ comparing length ) -- longest first
. nub -- unique entries only
. powerset -- all combinations of
. canonicalize -- canonical ( sorted ) string
$ s
where canonicalize is just sort .
map toLower .
filter isLetter .
comparing is a nice litle utility sub that makes the above effectively the
same as ( \a b -> length a `compare` length b ) .
We then flip it to reverse the
ordering ( and this is actually a good use for flip ;-) .
Ordering by length is potentially inefficient â€ ” it checks the length of each
element twice , and unlike Perl ( where a string knows its own length ) , a string is
just a list , so it has to descend the list to find it out .
This is easy to optimize
by precalculating the lengths , using a technique that in Perl we call the " Schwartzian
transform " , and I 'll probably come back to this .
OK , so we have a list of subsets to compare , now we need to find a dictionary of
canonical representations of words .
Luckily most unixy distributions ship with
one , often /usr / dict / words , but Ubuntu sticks is elsewhere .
I asked on #haskell , and was told I should use a Data .
Map , Haskell's
basic equivalent of a hash or associative array , but implemented using a
Functional Programming friendly tree representation .
In actual fact ,
quicksilver , mrs , and mmorrow told me the answer straight away , but let 's
pretend for the purpose of this post that we 're working it out now :-)
Assuming I load that
module , as is common , as M , I 'd essentially want to call
M.insertWith (++ ) on each element .
The (++ ) is the
concatenation operator , and it's the right thing to use because the
dictionary is mapping String -> [ String ] , for example
fromList [ ( " admno " , [ " nomad " , " monad " , " Damon " ] ) , ...]
insertWith returns a new copy of the Map each time .
It 's like an accumulator
which gradually takes on the entries from the list of words .
And whenever we think
about accumulators , we can think about folds .
foldl ' ( \m x -> M.insertWith (++ ) ( canonicalize x ) [ x ] m ) mempty listOfWords
mempty is shorthand here for " an empty Data . Map " .
But we can go one better as
apparently fold / insertWith is so common that there is a shorthand , fromListWith !
fromListWith (++ ) . map ( canonicalize &&& return )
Woah !
That 's quite compact , and I just introduced some new syntax too :
The
&&& is basically saying " let 's make a tuple with
the result of calling these 2 functions on my input ! " so it 's the same as
fromListWith (++ ) . map ( \a -> ( canonicalize a , return a ) )
And return just means " wrap this value in the appropriate Monad " .
So it 's
a scary way of saying [ a ] , because we 're " in " the List monad .
( In the same way
that mempty above was an empty Data .
Map , because it was " in " the Map Monad . )
Whenever I play with Map , I get angry errors about the monomorphism restriction .
The way around that is to add an explicit type signature .
If , like me , you 're not
quite sure what to put there , you can add a compiler directive to quell the error ,
then work out what the signature would be by calling :t my_function from the
GHCI command line .
( You 'll often find afterwards that you can remove the signatures
if you wanted to , because later on the compiler has more information to work out the
types of things .
It 's only really during incremental development that you
get the problem .
{-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-}
-- ( that 's the compiler directive , you can comment this out later )
makeAnag s = do
d <- dict
return $ take 4 $ getAnagrams s d
dict = do file <- readFile " /etc/dictionaries -common/words "
return $ mkdict $ lines file
mkdict :: [ String ] -> M.Map String [ String ]
mkdict = M.fromListWith (++ ) . map ( canonicalize &&& return ) .
filter longEnough
longEnough = ( > =3 ) . length
As you can see , for all the perceived difficulty of doing IO in a pure language
like Haskell , it does n't seem all that hard in this simple case .
readFile
reads the file , and lines splits it into an array of lines .
The final thing is to check each powerset against the dictionary .
To extract the value , we use M.lookup .
This function fail s if it
ca n't find a value .
So we could do
For each powerset in the list
Check if it 's present
And add it to the list if so
Which of course we could do with the Maybe type and a filter .
But we want a list , and in the List type , failure is represented by an empty list
[ ] .
So we can just map and we'd get something like :
[ [ " anagram " ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ " anagram 1 " , " anagram 2 " ] , [ ] ]
With an empty list for each failure .
We can use concatMap to join these together .
So it's :
concatMap ( \v -> M.lookup v dict ) listOfPowersets
Though that actually returns :
[ [ " anagram " ] , [ " anagram 1 " , " anagram 2 " ] , ]
which I had n't expected .
( M.lookup returned a list like [ " anagram
1 " , " anagram 2 " ] .
Quite literally it return ed it , which in List context means it
actually passed [ [ " anagram 1 " , " anagram 2 " ] ] , which is why the list is n't completely
flattened by concatMap .
I get around this by using join .
This is another of those
monadic functions : in List context it does exactly what we want here , flattening this list .
getAnagrams s d = join
. concatMap ( flip M.lookup $ d)
$ filter longEnough -- 3 or more letters
. sortBy ( flip $ comparing length ) -- longest first
. nub -- unique entries only
. powerset -- all combinations of
. canonicalize -- canonical ( sorted ) string
$ s
You can look at the final Haskell Countdown code .
I 'll look at optimizing the sort and the powersets soon , any comments on
other improvements ( including better algorithms ) very welcome .

Few sights in nature can compare to the sheer magnificence of a volcano erupting in full flow .
But while scenes of molten lava are relatively commonplace , this otherworldly picture of Chaiten Volcano in southern Chile shows a truly spectacular , and devastating , volcanic phenomenon .
Scroll down for more ...
This astonishing picture shows the Chaiten volcano erupting during storms in the middle of the night
As clouds of toxic ash and dust tower into the sky , they ionise the air , generating an explosive electrical storm .
Colossal forks of lightning spark around the noxious plume as it spews from the volcano 's crater , creating an image of raw , terrifying energy - as if the air itself were ablaze .
Now , the worst - case scenario is the collapse of the volcano accompanied by a " pyroclastic flow " - a devastating super - eruption of scorching dense gas and molten rock that would roll down the mountainside at 100 mph or faster , incinerating and flattening all in its wake .
Thankfully , experts think this is unlikely at this stage .
Scroll down for more ...
The Chaiten volcano has triggered earth tremors and spewed ash two miles into the air
Seen from space , Chaiten 's ash plume streams across Argentina towards the Atlantic
Locals wear masks to protect themselves from the all - pervasive ash near Futaleuf
The gigantic plume of smoke from the volcano dominates the skyline
Pyroclastic flows are also called nuees ardentes - or " burning clouds " - and are probably the single most destructive weapon in nature 's armoury , capable of flattening cities in seconds .
It was such a catastrophe that destroyed the Roman town of Pompeii in AD79 .
The 3,300 ft Chaiten Volcano , 800 miles south of the Chilean capital Santiago , is erupting for the first time in thousands of years , sending a plume of ash into the sky that stretches as far as Argentina .
It is also spewing out chunks of lava and hot rock .
Authorities have already evacuated around 4,200 people from the town of Chaiten , six miles from the volcano , but 300 civilians and troops remain and are being evacuated now .
Rescue is complicated by the fact that southern Chile is fragmented by fjords and access is often difficult .
Scroll down for more ...
The village of Chaiten , next to the volcano , was virtually emptied in a massive evacuation
Winds carried the ash to other towns in the region and across the Andes to Argentina
A local resident cycles through the ash as it settles across the town
The authorities are also evacuating a second town , Futaleufu .
Some of Futaleufu 's 1,000 or so residents had already crossed into neighbouring Argentina , where some areas have been showered with ash and where authorities last week closed schools and treated some for breathing problems .
The ash is more than six inches ( 15 cm ) thick in places , and has contaminated water supplies .
Chile , which sits right on the Pacific 's volcanic " ring of fire " , has the world 's second most active string of volcanoes behind Indonesia .
“ Companies came into this period with extraordinarily high profit margins , ” said Edward McKelvey , chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs , “ and some of the surge in raw material costs will be absorbed by lowering those profits . ”
Still , the prevailing attitude that the economy could just keep absorbing higher oil prices is being tested  for the first time in nearly 30 years .
Adjusted for inflation , a barrel of crude is now more expensive than it was in 1980 , the previous peak .
“ The conventional wisdom a couple of years ago was that oil did not have that much leverage over the economy , ” said Daniel Yergin , chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
“ But now it plainly does .
People are suddenly paying much more attention to their energy costs and trying to figure out how to manage them . ”
Goodyear has kept its head above water in part by passing along some of the higher prices to dealers .
The dealers , however , have not been able to pass along all of those increases to consumers and are absorbing the difference in lower profits .
Since last spring , the average profits of the nation ’s corporations  from behemoths like Goodyear to small neighborhood retailers  have declined at an annual rate of nearly 6 percent , government data show .
Even companies that have been performing well in the economic downturn are sounding notes of caution .
Take Costco , the discount retail chain , which offers a wide array of consumer goods , food , wine , furniture , appliances , beauty aids and much more .
Costco ’s profit was up in the first quarter , but James D. Sinegal , the chief executive , says he is “ starting to be confronted with unprecedented price increases ” for the merchandise that Costco buys to stock its stores .
His first response has been to buy in extra large quantities so that he has stock on hand to carry him through subsequent price increases .
During the writer 's strike , I stopped watching both The Daily Show and The Colbert Report .
Recently , I started watching both again .
I was glad to see that Colbert was still at the top of his game .
His charm giving center and focus to his charmingly assholish character .
However , the Daily Show has lost most of its steam .
I do n't think that Stewart or his team realize that the two things that made the show are now lacking .
Those two things are : 1 . Fantastic correspondents , and 2 . A consistent world view .
The great correspondents have mostly moved on , except Samantha Bee maybe .
We 're getting the Ellen Cleghornes or the Seth Meyers replacing Tina Fey version of correspondents , with exceptions including Bee , a rare Dimitri Martin or PC guy appearance .
And the point of view of the show has dried up .
That point of view was generally , Look at this bullshit , look what it 's hiding .
Stewart 's venom at the artifice of politics is his best stuff ( more and more I see his humor as a Robin Williams - light like pastiche of all the comedy that has come before him ) .
Nowadays , he seems as stifled by the news media 's fetish for chewing on whatever cud you get served up .
Stewart is silent on impeachment and fair - to - middlin ' on the various investigations which are now unveiling the armor in this administration that he helped crack .
But even worse , he has n't been very funny doing it .
The bits are too sketchy and the punchlines too tepid .
This is n't to say that he has to make fun of Bush .
It just means that when he 's making fun of the left he has to be funnier than Rush Limbaugh .
I know Conservative framers love to make it seem like we can't handle Obama being criticized .
It 's worse than that actually .
I can't stand to be embarrassed by gags like the " Hummer Copter , " which if Don Imus did would have him off the air again .
So last night , Stewart tells us it 's OK to laugh at Obama .
He told a couple of flat jokes about the pseudo Presidential seal Obama 's team has been putting on the Senator 's podium .
He spent two minutes explaining the symbols without one decent joke .
When the audience seemed pained .
Stewart explained that we are allowed to laugh at Obama .
Yeah , it 's OK to laugh at Obama .
Stewart has spoken .
But what he really means is , Please laugh at me .
Unfortunately Stewart 's character has n't been the charmingly assholish one .
But the good news is that if the Daily Show is on , I can put the TV on mute and wait a little bit for Colbert to be an asshole on purpose .
Fafblog Interviews : HILLARY CLINTON FAFBLOG : Wow , Hillary Clinton , right here on our little blog !
Well , we do n't want to waste your time so let 's cut to the chase !
Why should we vote for you for president ?
HILLARY CLINTON : One word , Fafnir : experience .
I have thirty - five years of experience working for change , building a list of accomplishments so lengthy and impressive no one else even knows what they are .
Why , I could go on for hours just about the policies I advanced as First Lady , from critical legislation like the Mumble - Something Act to my efforts to bring peace to the troubled region of Upper McDonaldland .
FB : And millions of Americans still enjoy the benefits of your successful health care plan in some distant parallel universe !
CLINTON : That 's right , Fafnir .
No one has more experience failing to fix health care than me .
I worked in the White House for eight years failing to fix health care , and as president I 'll make failing to fix health care my number one priority .
FB : Well that sounds pretty good , Hillary Clinton , but what if I wanna vote for someone with even more experience , like John McCain or Zombie Strom Thurmond or Andrew Jackson 's collection of antique spittoons ?
Those spittoons have been in the White House for a long time an I hear they got a formidable command of foreign policy .
CLINTON : Ha haaa !
Well you know , anyone off the street with a scary black pastor can talk about change , but it takes a fighter to fight for change .
And I 'm a fighter .
I 'm tough .
And if you lived my life you'd be pretty darn tough too .
I mean , I had to go to Wellesley .
That was my safety school .
But I was strong anyway and I endured .
And as president I 'll fight the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry and the health care industry , just as soon as they stop giving me millions of dollars !
FB : That 's that no -nonsense down - to - business style I like about you , Hillary Clinton !
You do n't just talk about change .
You talk about how much you do n't just talk about change !
CLINTON : That 's just the way I am , I guess .
Oh , hang on a second , I have to wrestle a hog in a giant trough of grits .
It 's just something I do !
FB : Now , back when your husband was president he cut nine million poor women and children off welfare .
But now you 're the candidate of women and poor people and poor workin women .
So did you approve of what your husband did at the time , and if not are you going to reverse it as president and give all those poor people their money back ?
CLINTON : Ha haaa !
That 's an excellent question , Fafnir , and the only way to answer it is with a hearty chuckle followed by a complete non sequitur !
FB : Ha ha , that is so true !
CLINTON : You know , I wish I could make all those women 's lives better , I really do .
But in a way , would n't it help all of them even more if we could just make one woman 's life a whole lot better , and then say it sort of counts towards all those other women who are n't getting anything ?
And would n't it be even better - er if that one woman was me ?
FB : You know , you just can't argue with that math !
Now are you running for president of Iraq , too ?
Because then your vote for the war totally makes sense !
CLINTON : I did n't vote for the war , Fafnir .
I voted to give the president the authority to go to war .
What was he going to use that authority for ?
Maybe he'd just frame it and hang it in his office .
Maybe he'd use it to prop up one of the legs on his desk .
Maybe he'd use it to sing songs and dance jigs and lift weary spirits down at the old folks home !
I honestly could n't say !
FB : If only you knew at the time that that devious George Bush would use a war authorization to authorize a war !
CLINTON : You know , I guess I 'm just too giving .
Maybe I just love my country too much to deny it the universal health care and endless wars it so desperately needs .
Maybe some theoretical secret black Muslim who hates America would n't have that problem .
FB : Maybe it did n't have to be an actual war , though .
Maybe you coulda just met the president halfway by settin a big pile a money on fire an shootin a buncha random people .
CLINTON : You know , Fafnir , we could stand around and argue over who raped and slaughtered whose country all day long , but where 's that gonna get us ?
What America needs now is a president who 's ready on day one to rape and slaughter competently for the American people in the next war , and I 've got the sixty - five years of experience to do it .
FB : Ooh , ooh !
Where 's the next war gonna be , Hillary Clinton ?
Is it gonna be Iran ?
I bet it 's gonna be Iran !
CLINTON : Ha haaaa !
Oh , you wo n't get spoilers out of me that easily !
FB : Oh , you know I had to try !
Now let 's say you were president tomorrow .
What 's the first thing you 'd do in Iraq ?
CLINTON : Well the first thing we have to do is to start holding the Iraqis accountable .
Our troops have done everything they 've been asked to do : blow stuff up , kill things , kill things that 're trying to run away after we 've blown their stuff up .
But where have the Iraqis been on this ?
Nowhere .
You know , war and occupation is n't a one - way street .
When are Iraqis finally going to put some real effort into rebuilding the government and infrastructure we 've worked so hard to destroy ?
Where 's the cooperation here ?
Where 's the sense of responsibility ?
FB : Yeah , what 's wrong with those guys ?
Every time you try to get em to stand up an take charge they 're all " oh , death to America , oh , my child is dead , oh , I have no limbs . "
CLINTON : And it 's not like we do n't have our own problems back in the U.S .
They 've got a couple hundred thousand dead people ?
Well , let me tell you something , four dollar a gallon gasoline is no picnic either !
FB : If you could say one thing to the average legless Iraqi on the street right now , what would it be ?
CLINTON : I 'd tell him , you know , we 've done our part here .
We got rid of Saddam , we set up a government , we provided intermittently running electricity and free bandages for your leg - stumps .
We gave you your chance .
Now you 've gotta step up .
FB : Figuratively speaking .
' Cause he does n't have legs .
CLINTON : And then I 'd station forty to fifty - thousand residual troops in his house for the next couple decades or so to protect our interests in the region .
FB : Now let 's go to the lightning round !
Get out of Iraq or bomb Iran ?
CLINTON : Get out of Iraq by going through Iran !
FB : End wiretapping or double Gitmo ?
CLINTON : Privatize wiretapping , then outsource Gitmo to more efficient overseas contractors !
FB : Talk to Hamas or nuke the Mideast ?
CLINTON : Why not both !
FB : Torture or universal health care !
CLINTON : Universal torture with optional market - based health savings accounts !
FB : Now that 's the kinda sensible hard - nosed moderation I can get behind !
Thanks for stopping by , Hillary Clinton !
CLINTON : Oh , I 'll be around .
FAFBLOG : Wow , Hillary Clinton , right here on our little blog !

FB : Well that sounds pretty good , Hillary Clinton , but what if I wanna vote for someone with even more experience , like John McCain or Zombie Strom Thurmond or Andrew Jackson 's collection of antique spittoons ?
Those spittoons have been in the White House for a long time an I hear they got a formidable command of foreign policy .
CLINTON : Ha haaa !
Well you know , anyone off the street with a scary black pastor can talk about change , but it takes a fighter to fight for change .
And I 'm a fighter .
I 'm tough .
And if you lived my life you'd be pretty darn tough too .
I mean , I had to go to Wellesley .
That was my safety school .
But I was strong anyway and I endured .
And as president I 'll fight the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry and the health care industry , just as soon as they stop giving me millions of dollars !
FB : That 's that no -nonsense down - to - business style I like about you , Hillary Clinton !
You do n't just talk about change .
You talk about how much you do n't just talk about change !
CLINTON : That 's just the way I am , I guess .
Oh , hang on a second , I have to wrestle a hog in a giant trough of grits .
It 's just something I do !
FB : Now , back when your husband was president he cut nine million poor women and children off welfare .
But now you 're the candidate of women and poor people and poor workin women .
So did you approve of what your husband did at the time , and if not are you going to reverse it as president and give all those poor people their money back ?
CLINTON : Ha haaa !
That 's an excellent question , Fafnir , and the only way to answer it is with a hearty chuckle followed by a complete non sequitur !
FB : Ha ha , that is so true !
CLINTON : You know , I wish I could make all those women 's lives better , I really do .
But in a way , would n't it help all of them even more if we could just make one woman 's life a whole lot better , and then say it sort of counts towards all those other women who are n't getting anything ?
And would n't it be even better - er if that one woman was me ?
FB : You know , you just can't argue with that math !
Now are you running for president of Iraq , too ?
Because then your vote for the war totally makes sense !
CLINTON : I did n't vote for the war , Fafnir .
I voted to give the president the authority to go to war .
What was he going to use that authority for ?
Maybe he'd just frame it and hang it in his office .
Maybe he'd use it to prop up one of the legs on his desk .
Maybe he'd use it to sing songs and dance jigs and lift weary spirits down at the old folks home !
I honestly could n't say !
FB : If only you knew at the time that that devious George Bush would use a war authorization to authorize a war !
CLINTON : You know , I guess I 'm just too giving .
Maybe I just love my country too much to deny it the universal health care and endless wars it so desperately needs .
Maybe some theoretical secret black Muslim who hates America would n't have that problem .
FB : Maybe it did n't have to be an actual war , though .
Maybe you coulda just met the president halfway by settin a big pile a money on fire an shootin a buncha random people .
CLINTON : You know , Fafnir , we could stand around and argue over who raped and slaughtered whose country all day long , but where 's that gonna get us ?
What America needs now is a president who 's ready on day one to rape and slaughter competently for the American people in the next war , and I 've got the sixty - five years of experience to do it .
FB : Ooh , ooh !
Where 's the next war gonna be , Hillary Clinton ?
Is it gonna be Iran ?
I bet it 's gonna be Iran !
CLINTON : Ha haaaa !
Oh , you wo n't get spoilers out of me that easily !
FB : Oh , you know I had to try !
Now let 's say you were president tomorrow .
What 's the first thing you 'd do in Iraq ?
CLINTON : Well the first thing we have to do is to start holding the Iraqis accountable .
Our troops have done everything they 've been asked to do : blow stuff up , kill things , kill things that 're trying to run away after we 've blown their stuff up .
But where have the Iraqis been on this ?
Nowhere .
You know , war and occupation is n't a one - way street .
When are Iraqis finally going to put some real effort into rebuilding the government and infrastructure we 've worked so hard to destroy ?
Where 's the cooperation here ?
Where 's the sense of responsibility ?
FB : Yeah , what 's wrong with those guys ?
Every time you try to get em to stand up an take charge they 're all " oh , death to America , oh , my child is dead , oh , I have no limbs .
"
CLINTON : And it 's not like we do n't have our own problems back in the U.S .
They 've got a couple hundred thousand dead people ?
Well , let me tell you something , four dollar a gallon gasoline is no picnic either !
FB : If you could say one thing to the average legless Iraqi on the street right now , what would it be ?
CLINTON : I 'd tell him , you know , we 've done our part here .
We got rid of Saddam , we set up a government , we provided intermittently running electricity and free bandages for your leg - stumps .
We gave you your chance .
Now you 've gotta step up .
FB : Figuratively speaking .
' Cause he does n't have legs .
CLINTON : And then I 'd station forty to fifty - thousand residual troops in his house for the next couple decades or so to protect our interests in the region .
FB : Now let 's go to the lightning round !
Get out of Iraq or bomb Iran ?
CLINTON : Get out of Iraq by going through Iran !
FB : End wiretapping or double Gitmo ?
CLINTON : Privatize wiretapping , then outsource Gitmo to more efficient overseas contractors !
FB : Talk to Hamas or nuke the Mideast ?
CLINTON : Why not both !
FB : Torture or universal health care !
CLINTON : Universal torture with optional market - based health savings accounts !
FB : Now that 's the kinda sensible hard - nosed moderation I can get behind !
Thanks for stopping by , Hillary Clinton !
CLINTON : Oh , I 'll be around .
