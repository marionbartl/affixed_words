A Los Angeles stoner guru has exposed movie hunk Brad Pitt as a one - time weed - smoking beach bum , who used to live to get high .
Now a responsible dad of six , Pitt recently revealed he no longer smokes anything , but one old pal claims the actor used to boast of toting pot on movie sets with big - name co-stars .
Craig Z. Rudin , who used to run 2000 BC , the trendy drug paraphernalia shop Pitt once frequented , tells America 's Globe tabloid , " It was no secret Brad liked to smoke pot .
He was so open and honest about it .
It seemed to me all he wanted to do was smoke weed , make movies and go to the beach .
" He 'd come into the shop all the time .
He came in once and was excited about smoking with one of his very big - name co-stars .
' We blaze ( smoke pot ) every day in his trailer , ' Brad boasted .
He had a huge grin on his face . "
Rudin claims
Pitt , who was once spotted wearing a T - shirt with ' I live for hemp ' emblazoned on it , and a sweater bearing a large marijuana leaf printed on it , was such a fan of drug culture , he gave the crew of one film decorative bongs he'd bought from 2000 BC as gifts .
The marijuana advocate , who is now running for Mayor of Los Angeles , claims Pitt brought ex-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow into his Melrose Avenue store , but the actress was far from impressed .
Meanwhile , a longtime friend of Pitt 's tells the Globe the movie hunk is much " clearer " now he 's given up pot .
He says , " His whole life has changed since he stopped smoking pot .
He found he was thinking clearer and feeling better . "
At the end of last year , FDA identified 28 fraudulent products marketed for weight loss .
Last week , it added 41 more tainted items to its hit list .
The agency , which has warned consumers to stop taking the products , said it has already inspected some of the manufacturers .
FDA warmed that if the companies do not respond adequately to recall requests it will pursue additional enforcement measures , which could include warning letters , product seizures , injunctions or criminal charges .
Fertile for fraud ​
The weight loss category has been particularly susceptible to adultery due to a widespread consumer desire to find a ‘ quick fix ’ to problems of overweight ; and the internet has served as fertile breeding ground for the sale of unapproved products that tap into this consumer desire .
However , the category has been under the regulatory spotlight for some time now .
Last year , NutraIngredients - USA.com reported that the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , which regulates product advertising , had identified weight loss as a major focus .
“ We 're never short of targets in the weight loss industry , " ​ said Michelle Rusk , from FTC 's division of advertising practices .
For the full article , click here​ .
Undeclared pharmaceuticals ​
The undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients that FDA found in its latest sweep included sibutramine , rimonabant , phenolphthalein and bumetanide .
Sibutramine is a controlled substance that can cause high blood pressure , seizures , tachycardia ( rapid heart beat ) , palpitations , heart attack or stroke .
The drug , which has not been established as safe for pregnant women or children , can also interact negatively with other medications .
Rimonabant is a drug not approved for marketing in the United States .
It is said to have been associated with increased risk of depression and suicidal thoughts , and in Europe – where it is approved – it has been linked to five deaths and 720 adverse reactions over the last two years , according to FDA .
Out of the other ingredients detected , phenytoin is an anti-seizure medication , bumetanide is a diuretic and phenolphthalein is a solution used in chemical experiments and a suspected cancer - causing agent .
FDA said some of the amounts of active pharmaceutical ingredients far exceeded the FDA - recommended levels .
Industry support ​
The dietary supplement industry has been quick to express support to FDA ’s enforcement action .
Fraudulent or bogus supplement products have dragged down the reputation of the industry as a whole , damaging sales and growth opportunities for safe , scientifically - backed supplements .
“ The majority of companies in the dietary supplement industry abide by the law and work hard to provide the more than 150 million Americans who take vitamins and other dietary supplements with safe , high quality , and beneficial products , ” ​ said Steve Mister , president and CEO , of supplement trade group Council for Responsible Nutrition ( CRN ) on Friday .
“ We applaud FDA ’s efforts to protect consumers from tainted weight loss products that contain active , undeclared ingredients [ and support ] the Agency ’s decision to demand removal of these adulterated products from the market . ” ​
New regulations governing the quality and safety of dietary supplement products in the US started to be phased in last year .
The current good manufacturing practices ( GMPs ) , which have required a major shift in the way companies conduct and record their operations , are expected to maintain quality assurance standards and reduce the risk of contamination .
The Home Office in the UK has reportedly adopted a new plan to allow police across Britain to routinely hack into people 's personal computers without a warrant , allowing police or MI5 officers to covertly examine the hard drive of someone 's PC at his home , office or hotel room -- all from a remote location .
The pronouncement comes after a decision by the European Union 's council of ministers in Brussels expanding the implementation of a statute permitting warrant - less surveillance of private property .
Material gathered by " remote searching " includes the content of all emails , Internet browsing history and instant messaging .
Civil liberty groups and opposition MPs describe the hacking as a sinister extension of the surveillance state which " drives a coach and horses " through privacy laws .
( Source : timesonline.co.uk )
French , German and other EU forces will be allowed to ask British officers to hack into someone 's UK computer and pass on any information gathered .
Under the plan , a remote search can be granted if a senior officer says he " believes " that it is " proportionate " and necessary to prevent or detect " serious crime , " which is defined as any offense punishable by a jail sentence of more than three years .
Given this , authorities would be able to break into a suspect 's home or office and insert a key - logging device into an individual 's computer that could collect , and if necessary , transmit the suspect 's keystrokes .
Key - logging hardware , by the way , is very easy to detect .
Authorities could also send an email to a suspect containing a virus that , if opened , would covertly install the remote search facility .
Another option might be to park outside a suspect 's home and hack into their computer through a wireless network .
Germany 's highest court has ruled that spying on personal computers violates privacy , but governments across Europe are under pressure to help their security services fight terrorism and organized crime .
( Source : bbc.co.uk )
Broadening such intrusive surveillance powers should be regulated .
Furthermore , powers that astringent should not be granted based on an officer 's " belief , " unless it 's backed by verifiable suspicion or evidence .
Police say that such methods are necessary to investigate suspects who use cyberspace to carry out crimes , including pedophiles , Internet fraudsters , identity thieves , and terrorists .
Exercising such intrusive power raises serious privacy issues and there must be safeguards in place to prevent abuse .
It 's becoming painfully evident that there is a fuzzy line between ' preventing crimes and acts of terrorism ' and paranoia .
One has to wonder why that type of intrusion is even necessary when Britain plans to monitor a super - database of every one of its citizens .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 December 11
Explanation :
At the center of our Milky Way Galaxy lies a supermassive black hole .
Once a controversial claim , this conclusion is now solidly based on 16 years of observations that map the orbits of 28 stars very near the galactic center .
Using European Southern Observatory telescopes and sophisticated near infrared cameras , astronomers patiently measured the positions of the stars over time , following one star , designated S2 , through a complete orbit as it came within about 1 light - day of the center of the Milky Way .
Their results convincingly show that S2 is moving under the influence of the enormous gravity of a compact , unseen object -- a black hole with 4 million times the mass of the Sun .
Their ability to track stars so close to the galactic center accurately measures the black hole 's mass and also determines the distance to the center to be 27,000 light - years .
This deep , near - infrared image shows the crowded inner 3 light - years of the central Milky Way .
Spectacular time - lapse animations of the stars orbiting within light - days of the galactic center can be found here .
In order to provide intuition behind the solution of the Monty Hall problem , Antonio Cangiano says :
If there were a billion doors , you picked one , and then Monty proceeded to open up all the remaining doors but one , we ’d have a situation where it would be extremely unlikely that you picked the right door at the beginning , while it would be extremely likely that the remaining door was the one that was concealing the car .
Now , what happens when there are more than three doors .
In this post , I will modify the solution of my last post to work for any number of doors .
It requires a little change to the program .
import Data .
List ( delete , ( \\ ) ) import Text .
Printf ( printf ) import Control .
Monad import Control.Monad.MC
This time , instead of defining Door by listing all alternatives , I define it as an instance of Bounded class .
data Door = Door Int deriving ( Show , Eq ) numDoors = 3 instance Bounded Door where minBound = Door 1 maxBound = Door numDoors instance Enum Door where toEnum n = Door n fromEnum ( Door n ) = n doors = [ minBound .. maxBound ] :: [ Door ]
Object are the same as before .
data Object = Car |
Goat deriving ( Show , Eq ) type Universe = [ Object ]
There is one car ; all other doors have goats .
This can still be generated using the shuffle function .
nature :: MC Universe nature = shuffle numDoors ( Car : repeat Goat )
The contestant open one door at random .
contestant :: MC
Door contestant = sample numDoors doors
The options available to the host remain the same as before .
options :: Universe -> Door -> [ Door ] options universe door = filter ( \d ->
Goat == open universe d) remainder where remainder = delete door doors
We need a generic function to see what is behind a closed door .
open :: Universe -> Door ->
Object open universe ( Door n ) = universe !! ( n - 1 )
The host opens all but one door .
We can do this by replacing the sample function with sampleSubset function .
host :: [ Door ] -> MC [ Door ] host o = sampleSubset ( numDoors - 2 ) l o where l = length o
The strategies are now whether to stick or switch based on the door that the contestant chose , and the doors that the host opened .
strategyStick :: Door -> [ Door ] ->
Door strategy Stick d1 d2 = d1 strategy Switch :: Door -> [ Door ] ->
Door strategy Switch d1 d2 = head ( doors \\ ( d1:d2 ) )
The reward function is same as before .
reward :: Universe -> Door ->
Double reward u d = if Car == open u d then 1.0 else 0.0
And so is the generation of the ranom experiment .
randomVariable :: ( Door -> [ Door ] -> Door ) ->
MC
Double randomVariable strategy = do u <- nature c <- contestant h <- host ( options u c ) let r = reward u ( strategy c h ) return r
And we see the result .
main = let n = 100000 seed = 42 stats = repeatMC n ( randomVariable strategyStick ) `evalMC` mt19937 seed in do putStrLn $ printf "
numDoors : %d " numDoors putStrLn $ printf " Mean : %f " ( sampleMean stats ) putStrLn $ printf " 99 % % Confidence interval : ( %f , %f ) " `uncurry` ( sampleCI 0.99 stats )
Now lets see the results .
For
numDoors : 3 Mean : 0.3334800000000033 99 % Confidence interval : ( 0.3296397390134338 , 0.33732026098657275 ) numDoors : 30 Mean : 0.03466999999999957 99 % Confidence interval : ( 0.03317983597888913 , 0.03616016402111001 ) numDoors : 300 Mean : 0.0038399999999999784 99 % Confidence interval : ( 0.0033362101507491866 , 0.00434378984925077 )
Well , I think that you get the idea .
I am not going to run this thing for a billion doors .

Although I do not condone prostitution , I do have some advice that you may find useful .
When the guy is inserting himself in you , you should be relaxed .
If you are tense , then it will hurt a lot .
Massaging the anus should help a lot .
Also , make sure he uses a lot of lubrication .
Make sure that you take a trip to the bathroom before you do it , because if there is anything in there , then it can hurt .
You might also want to try a lubrication specially for anal sex , like " anal ease " .
Yes anal sex can be painful , but it can also feel really good .
If you do it wrong , you could wind up with hemorhoids , rectal bleeding , or even a punctured rectum .
Please also remember that anal sex transmits HIV much more efficiently than vaginal sex , so you might want to use a condom .
If you did not know , the President will visit Prime Minister Steven Harper in Ottawa today .
This is considered a working trip and the President will be in Canada for about six hours .
President Barack Obama will leave today for Canada -- his first foreign trip as president -- where he is expected to discuss trade and the environment with Prime Minister Stephen Harper .
A top Obama aide said this week that the president 's main message to Harper will be to reassure Canadians that the United States intends to maintain a robust trading relationship with its neighbor .
" This is no time to -- for anybody to give the impression that somehow we are interested in less rather than more trade , " said Denis McDonough , deputy national security adviser .
" And that 's what -- that 's the message that he 'll underscore . "
McDonough said the discussion will include some reassurances from Obama that " Buy American " trade provisions inserted into the economic stimulus legislation the president signed this week will not adversely affect trade .

Alaska ’s first major wind farm could be operational by 2010
According to officials with Cook Inlet Region Inc. , the Native corporation that plans to develop the 30 megawatt Fire Island wind farm , construction could begin on the state ’s first wind farm as early as this summer .
But the project has been a long time in the works and it still has a few hurdles to clear .
Plans for the wind farm call for twenty GE 1.5 megawatt wind turbines to be erected on the largely - barren Fire Island and connected to the mainland via a three - mile long cable .
The electricity will arrive at Point Campbell and be added to the regional grid that runs from Homer to Fairbanks .
CIRI is partnering with enXco to develop the Fire Island wind farm , but some lingering obstacles , mostly regulatory in nature , still need to be cleared before anything can be set in stone .
The Alaska Legislature approved $ 25 million last year to construct the seabed transmission line , but before the cable can be laid , developers need to ink long - term power purchase agreements with Alaska utilities .
CIRI spokesman Jim Jager told the Anchorage Daily News last week : “ Of course any of this can be thrown sideways by about a thousand different things .
But our anticipation is that there are n’t any show stoppers … and there will be power coming off the island late next year — in 2010 . ”
The project has been bandied about for nearly ten years and has been scaled back from its original plan of providing 100MW of wind power to the region .
The Army Corps is accepting public comments on the proposed Fire Island wind farm through February 19 .

( FAR MORE LETHAL ) attacks on Gaza ...
t
hey do n't really see the Muslims they want to kill as being fully human .
in the society 's weakest , most frightened , and most insecure individuals .
As George Orwell wrote in " Notes on Nationalism " -- with perfect prescience to today 's endless conflicts ( h/t Hume 's Ghost ) :
" All nationalists have the power of not seeing resemblances between similar sets of facts .
A British Tory will defend self - determination in Europe and oppose it in India with no feeling of inconsistency .
Actions are held to be good or bad , not on their own merits , but according to who does them , and there is almost no kind of outrage — torture , the use of hostages , forced labour , mass deportations , imprisonment without trial , forgery , assassination , the bombing of civilians — which does not change its moral colour when it is committed by ‘ our ’ side ...
The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side , but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them . "
For those who evaluate moral questions from that blindingly self - regarding perspective , anything and everything becomes easily justifiable .
The Israeli Supreme Court several days ago ordered the Government to allow reporters into Gaza , yet Israel continues to block all journalists from entering .
The reason , as casual_observer notes in comments , is clear :
The reason Israel has done this must be that they will do whatever they must -- including ignoring their own high court -- to limit evidence that Gazans are indeed human beings and that they are suffering the horrors that occur when war is unleashed on densely - packed urban civilians .
Israel knows full well that reporting from Gaza turns Gazans from vague abstractions to suffering human beings .
And they will not allow that reality to be communicated to the world .
It 's much easier to undervalue the suffering imposed on The Other when you do n't have to see it ...
- Glenn Greenwald ( Excerpt : " Orwell , Blinding Tribalism , Selective Terrorism , And Israel / Gaza , " 1.4.2009 .
Image : - Paul Schutzer , " Sparrows Resting On Barbed Wire , " 1962 ) .
VIOLETPLANET SAYS : ... and further , when you psychotically refuse to see it .
More to the point : for those who insist that others put themselves in the position of a resident of Sderot -- as though that will , by itself , prove the justifiability of the Israeli attack -- the idea literally never occurs to them that they ought to imagine what it 's like to live under foreign occupation for 4 decades ( and , despite the 2005 Israel continues to occupy and expand its settlements on Palestinian land and to control and severely restrict many key aspects of Gazan life ) .
No thought is given to what it is like , what emotions it generates , what horrible acts start to appear justifiable , when you have a hostile foreign army control your borders and airspace and internal affairs for 40 years , one which builds walls around you , imposes the most intensely humiliating conditions on your daily life , blockades your land so that you 're barred from exiting and prevented from accessing basic nutrition and medical needs for your children to the point where a substantial portion of the underage population suffers from stunted growth .
So extreme is their emotional identification with one side ( Israel ) that it literally never occurs to them to give any thought to any of that , to imagine what it 's like to live in those circumstances .
Still , there is a substantial difference between , on the one hand , basically well - intentioned people who are guilty of excessive emotional and cultural identification with one side of the dispute and , on the other , those who adopt the psychopathic derangement of belittling rage over widespread civilian deaths as mereor even something to view as a strategic asset .
The latter group is a subset of war supporters and evinces every defining attribute of the Terrorist .
Those who giddily support not just civilian deaths in Gaza but every actual and proposed attack on Arab / Muslim countries -- from the war in Iraq to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon to the proposed attacks on Iran and Syria and even continued escalation in Afghanistan -- are able to do so becauseFor obvious reasons , one typically finds this full - scale version of sociopathic indifference -- this perception of brutal war as a blood - pumping and exciting instrument for feeling vicarious sensations of power and strength from a safe distance -- If you see Palestinians as something less than civilized human beings : as - just as if you see Americans as infidels warring with God or Jews as sub - human rats -- then it naturally follows that civilian deaths are irrelevant , perhaps even something to cheer .
For people who think that way , arguments aboutwo n't even begin to resonate -- such concepts can't even be understood -- because the core premise , that excessive civilian deaths are horrible and should be avoided at all costs , is n't accepted .
Why should a superior , civilized , peaceful society allow the welfare of violent , hateful barbarians to interfere with its objectives ?
How can the deaths or suffering of thousands of barbarians ever be weighed against the death of even a single civilized person ?
It ’s not long until president Barrack Obama and his family will make their move into the White House and according to sources they are very close to a big decision .
What kind of dog will join them ?
In an interview with George Stephanopoulos on “ ABC’s This Week ” Obama reveals that they have narrowed it down to two breeds .
Their choices a Labradoodle or a Portugese water hound , ” Obama says .
“ So we ’re now going to start looking at shelters to see when one of those dogs might come up .
Obama also spoke about the changes taking place in the lives of their daughters which he described as “ smooth sailing . ”
“ They seemed to thrive , ” he says .
“ I ’m trying to figure out why it is that they do n’t seem to be fazed by anything .
They just do n’t seem to be intimidated . ”
Barack Obama will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20 .
Portuguese Water Dog
The Portuguese Water Dog is a unique looking breed .
With its rounded head leading to a rectangular shaped muzzle , the breed ’s has an interesting appearance .
Their sweet expression starts with their small brown eyes and folded ears which lie close to their head .
Their thick neck leads to a broad chest and sunken stomach .
The Portuguese Water Dog ’s long legs lead down to their round feet .
A distinctive characteristic of the breed is its long tail which is normally shaved to leave only a puff ball tip .
Their unique single layered coat is curly or wavy and lays close to their body .
Fur colors come in a large variety including black , white , brown , gray , silver fox , or parti-colored .
Their coat can also be brown or black with white spots .
This breed makes the caring process i.e. grooming easy , whether it ’s the dog or www.localdoggroomers.com.au who know what they ’re doing to take care of your dog .

Worse Than an Earthquake By Kathy Kelly � Rafah , Gaza
' If we were sheep and goats , they would be more willing to help us . '
( ENA )
Jan 21 , 2009
Traffic on Sea Street , a major thoroughfare alongside Gaza�s coastline , includes horses , donkeys pulling carts , cyclists , pedestrians , trucks and cars , mostly older models .
Overhead , in stark contrast to the street below , Israel�s ultra modern unmanned surveillance planes criss - cross the skies .
F16s and helicopters can also be heard .
Remnants of their deliveries , the casings of missiles , bombs and shells used during the past three weeks of Israeli attacks , are scattered on the ground .
Workers have cleared most of the roads .
Now , they are removing massive piles of wreckage and debris , much as people do following an earthquake .
" Yet , all the world helps after an earthquake , " said a doctor at the Shifaa hospital in Gaza .
" We feel very frustrated , " he continued .
" The West , Europe and the U.S. , watched this killing go on for 22 days , as though they were watching a movie , watching the killing of women and children without doing anything to stop it .
I was expecting to die at any moment .
I held my babies and expected to die .
There was no safe place in Gaza . "
He and his colleagues are visibly exhausted , following weeks of work in the Intensive Care and Emergency Room departments at a hospital that received many more patients than they could help .
" Patients died on the floor of the operating room because we had only six operating rooms , " said Dr. Saeed Abuhassan , M.D , an ICU doctor who grew up in Chicago .
" And really we don�t know enough about the kinds of weapons that have been used against Gaza . "
In 15 years of practice , Dr. Abuhassan says he never saw burns like those he saw here .
The burns , blackish in color , reached deep into the muscles and bones .
Even after treatment was begun , the blackish color returned .
Two of the patients were sent to Egypt because they were in such critical condition .
They died in Egypt .
But when autopsies were done , reports showed that the cause of death was poisoning from elements of white phosphorous that had entered their systems , causing cardiac arrests .
In Gaza City , The Burn Unit�s harried director , a plastic surgeon and an expert in treating burns , told us that after encountering cases they�d never seen before , doctors at the center performed a biopsy on a patient they believed may have suffered chemical burns and sent the sample to a lab in Egypt .
The results showed elements of white phosphorous in the tissue .
The doctor was interrupted by a phone call from a farmer who wanted to know whether it was safe to eat the oranges he was collecting from groves that had been uprooted and bombed during the Israeli invasion .
The caller said the oranges had an offensive odor and that when the workers picked them up their hands became itchy .
Audrey Stewart had just spent the morning with Gazan farmers in Tufaa , a village near the border between Gaza and Israel .
Israeli soldiers had first evacuated people , then dynamited the houses , then used bulldozers to clear the land , uprooting the orange tree groves .
Many people , including children , were picking through the rubble , salvaging belongings and trying to collect oranges .
At one point , people began shouting at Audrey , warning her that she was standing next to an unexploded rocket .
The doctor put his head in his hands , after listening to Audrey�s report .
" I told them to wash everything very carefully .
But these are new situations .
Really , I don�t know how to respond , " he said .
Yet he spoke passionately about what he knew regarding families that had been burned or crushed to death when their homes were bombed .
" Were their babies a danger to anyone ? " he asked us .
" They are lying to us about democracy and Western values , " he continued , his voice shaking .
" If we were sheep and goats , they would be more willing to help us . "
Dr. Saeed Abuhassan was bidding farewell to the doctors he�d worked with in Gaza .
He was returning to his work in the United Arab Emirates .
But before leaving , he paused to give us a word of advice .
" You know , the most important thing you can tell people in your country is that U.S. people paid for many of the weapons used to kill people in Gaza , " said Dr. Saeed Abuhassan .
" And this , also , is why it�s worse than an earthquake . "

By adding life - shortening bacteria to disease - carrying mosquitoes , Australian researchers might have found a clever way to control Dengue fever , a developing world scourge now becoming common in the southern United States .
Thus infected , mosquitoes live long enough to reproduce , ensuring contagion within their own population — but their lives are too short for the Dengue - causing virus inside them to become fully mature and deadly to humans .
" We 're not trying to eliminate the population , but to let a bacterial symbiont in , and then shift the population , " said University of Queensland bacterial geneticist Scott O'Neill .
" There will still be mosquitoes around , but only young ones .
It 's a biological control . "
Dengue fever infects between 50 and 100 million people worldwide , causing severe flu - like symptoms and — in especially severe cases — a hemorrhagic fever that kills more than 20,000 people each year .
Though treatable , the disease cannot be prevented — but not for lack of trying .
Many Dengue control plans , from pesticides to sterilized mosquitoes , have worked in a laboratory but fallen short in reality .
Nevertheless , O'Neill 's bacterial hack has drawn praise from grizzled Dengue control experts , and its promise comes at an opportune time .
Disease burden is greatest in the developing world , but climate change has driven Dengue 's tropical mosquito vectors into previously - inhospitable regions , and incidence is rising in the southern United States and Puerto Rico .
" This is n't just a problem in Central America and Africa and Southeast Asia .
It 's a growing problem as well in the United States , " said Joe Cummins , a University of Western Ontario geneticist who called O'Neill 's technique " simple and elegant . "
Years ago , O'Neill and his colleagues noticed that Wolbachia , a common bacterial parasite in insects , shortened the lives of fruit flies .
If it did the same in Dengue - carrying mosquitoes , they reasoned , it would kill them before virus reached maturity .
Dengue only affects humans during the last stages of its life cycle .
But repeated efforts to infect mosquitoes with Wolbachia failed until , as described in a paper published Thursday in Science , his team cultured the bacteria in dishes of mosquito cells for three years .
The microbes adapted to their new host species ' cellular environment .
O'Neill 's Wolbachia strain now has a taste for mosquitoes .
Once infected , the insects live for about a month — just half their normal lifespan , but long enough to reproduce .
Through a quirk of mosquito physiology , if an uninfected female mates with a Wolbachia - carrying male , she goes sterile .
Meanwhile , infected females produce infected offspring , regardless of the male 's disease status .
The mathematical inexorability of this phenomenon will make it difficult for mosquitoes to develop resistance , hopes O'Neill , and will guarantee Wolbachia 's Dengue - crippling spread through entire mosquito populations .
All he has to do is inject Wolbachia into a few starter bugs , breed them , and send them into the world .
" It 'll spread the trait out there 100 percent , despite the fitness cost , " he said .
" We 're in the sweet spot .
All individuals will get the parasite .
That 's the key to this whole strategy . "
The Dengue virus itself could also evolve into a more rapidly - maturing form , but O'Neill thinks this unlikely .
Only a few mosquitoes now live long enough for Dengue to reach full virulence : selection already favors accelerated development .
" I think we 're being close to up against some genetic constraint , where Dengue virus is going through mosquitoes as fast as it possibly can , " said O'Neill .
Duane Gubler , director of the Asia - Pacific Institute of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases , said the early results " look very promising . "
However , he cautioned that many earlier Dengue control approaches " worked beautifully in the laboratory , but failed miserably when taken to the field .
The real test is if they can show that this works in field populations . "
O'Neill , his research funded by the Gates Foundation , next plans on testing the method in large , enclosed cages .
That puts his developmental timeline behind another Gates Foundation - supported Dengue control plan , developed by biotechnology company Oxitec .
The company , which is scheduled to begin wild - release trials in Malaysia over the next three years , has developed genetically - engineered male mosquitoes whose offspring die shortly after hatching .
However , unless sustained by steady releases of engineered mosquitoes , the technique may only clear a path for fresh waves of disease carriers .
Modified mosquitoes could also face activist opposition , especially in the developed world .
As an alternative to such techniques , said Cummins , " I'm unabashedly positive " about using Wolbachia to hobble Dengue .
" The thing that 's so attractive is that it 's a green proposal , using organic techniques .
Hopefully it'll work . "
" I do n't see any down side to using this approach .
Wolbachia is ubiquitous in other species , " said Gubler .
Its use , he said , " should have no deleterious effects on the ecology . "
Gubler called the potential Dengue benefits " immeasurable " — and that , said O'Neill , could be just the beginning .
" The underlying principle applies to a range of other pathogens , including elephantiasis and malaria , " he said .
" We 'd like to see if this could be used for a range of other diseases as well . "

Rashad was told that he could be deported after his sentence A man who tried to kill his new bride weeks after their wedding in Pakistan has been jailed for seven years at the High Court in Edinburgh .
Muhammed Rashad , 29 , strangled , battered and tried to suffocate his cousin , Zahida , at their home in Kings Park , Glasgow , last October .
The attack happened after she had failed to answer the phone .
Rashad was convicted of attempted murder in September .
He was told he could be deported after his sentence .
The court heard how Rashad attacked his wife after demanding to know where she was when he tried to phone her .
She told him she had been in the house but had not heard the phone .
Rashad called her stupid before repeatedly punching her , slapping her with his hands and hitting her with a wooden spoon until it broke .
The woman then ran to her father - in - law 's room and begged for help .
You were found guilty of a prolonged , violent , dangerous and frightening attack on your young wife who was then in a particularly vulnerable position
Lord Kingarth
The court was told that he did nothing while Rashad kicked her and wrapped a mobile phone charger cord around her neck .
Rashid then tried to strangle his wife with his hands and smother her with a pillow .
Jailing him , judge Lord Kingarth , said : " You were found guilty of a prolonged , violent , dangerous and frightening attack on your young wife who was then in a particularly vulnerable position , she having only recently come from Pakistan to live in the United Kingdom .
" This is a matter which this court has to take seriously .
" In all the circumstances I am satisfied that only a substantial custodial sentence is appropriate . "
Lord Kingarth said he did not think it appropriate to recommend deporting Rashad because he had lived in the UK for years , had not offended before , and was deemed to be at low - risk of re-offending .
But he said that the Secretary of State had the power to send him back to his native Pakistan after his sentence .

OK , guys and gals , we hate to break it to you -- John Koller , Sony 's Director of Hardware Marketing has said it in plain English : " no plans for a PSP2 are underway . "
Apparently , the company is pushing developers towards the PlayStation store for their primary point of sale , a move that some people have taken to mean that the companies have been secretly developing games for some sort of new platform .
Of course , in the light of some similarly " cryptic " statements we reported yesterday , some folks might continue to beskeptical .
Which is fine , as long as nobody asks us when the device pictured above will be released .
' Cos it wo n't be .

Bill O'Reilly devoted another Talking Points Memo segment last night to his new pet thesis that Barack Obama is going to make the nation vulnerable to terrorist attack by taking torture off the table , and then brought Karl Rove on to back it all up :
You know , when he gets behind that desk , and has the awesome responsibility of protecting our country , anybody who 's chief executive of the United States is going to want to have the ability , in a time of a great crisis , to call upon enhanded interrogation techniques .
A little later , he closes with this :
Look , if you 've taken techniques that have kept America safe and you discard them , you are putting the country at risk and you 're going to have to bear the consequences of that .
OK , let me see if I can keep this all straight .
We 're now getting advice on how to prevent a terrorist attack from " the Brain " of an administration that manifestly failed at that because it was asleep at the wheel on 9/11 , am I right ?
And they 're telling us the torture regime they installed in the interim is responsible for the lack of subsequent attacks afterward -- rather than making the likelihood of future attacks greater ?
Karl Rove was a key player in an administration that , in the first eight months of its tenure , specifically undermined counterterrorism programs in an essentially political dismissal of such work as " a Clinton thing . "
There was the Aug. 6 , 2001 , presidential daily briefing titled " Bin Laden determined to strike in US , " which concluded that terrorists planned to attack us using airplanes .
It was ignored .
There was that briefing George Tenet gave Condi Rice on the immensity of the threat , which both she and George W. Bush also ignored -- and then lied about doing so afterward .
Indeed , Rice and the Bush administration ent to great measures to cover up their own incompetence .
There was the Hart - Rudman Commission report , which warned the White House in May 2001 that it needed to take serious steps to prevent a terrorist attack .
The report was ignored .
So was Richard Clarke 's memo of January 2001 warning of the terrorist threat .
And finally , there were the Bush White House 's pre-9/11 actions on a pure policy level : " Attorney General John Ashcroft not only moved aggressively to reduce DoJ 's anti-terrorist budget but also shift DoJ 's mission in spirit to emphasize its role as a domestic police force and anti-drug force . "
The administration also shifted Department of Defense counter - terrorism funding into missile - defense - system programs .
And yet for all that record , everyone in the press -- most especially Bill O'Reilly -- gave the Bush administration a pass for its massive malfeasance on terrorism , and came to believe that the lack of subsequent attacks meant that suddenly this gang knew what it was doing .
Even though what it was doing entailed violating basic international war - crimes laws and stoking the flames of hatred for the United States .
As the 2006 National Intelligence Estimate found , Bush 's invasion - under - false - pretenses of Iraq has actually made it far more likely we will have to endure future terrorist attacks .
That report noted that " actions by the United States government that were determined to have stoked the jihad movement " included " the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay and the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal . "
In other words , Karl Rove and his Jet Set Junta made it far more likely that we 're going to be hit by terrorists in the coming years , the credit going in part to misbegotten torture policies that have been proven ineffective and counterproductive .
And calling an end to those policies will make us more vulnerable ?
Oh really ?
And if such an attack happens , it will be Obama 's fault , according to Bill O'Reilly .
Because only Republicans get to skate when terrorists strike on their watch .
These people are not just crooks and liars .
They 're also insane .

Maybe Tony Soprano was onto something .
As the lead mobster in the HBO series " The Sopranos , " he and his crew often turned to prepaid cell phones , presumably to avoid wiretaps .
But now these pay - as - you - go phones are winning over fans for different reasons -- recession - battered consumers are buying them as a way to cut costs and avoid the lengthy contracts and occasional billing surprises that come with traditional cell phone plans .
" Frugal is the new chic , " said Joy Miller , 33 , a piano teacher in Aubrey , Texas .
After almost a decade on contract plans with Verizon Wireless , Miller and her husband decided this month to test - drive a few prepaid plans , including MetroPCS .
" In today 's economy , it 's not cool to pay $ 120 a month for a phone .
It 's a waste of money . "
Although prepaid phones remain a fraction of the overall mobile phone market , sales of the category grew 13 percent in North America last year , nearly three times faster than traditional cell phone plans , according to Pali Research , an investment advisory firm .
For the first time in its history , T - Mobile has been signing up more new prepaid customers than traditional ones .
And Sprint Nextel is betting that a new flat - rate prepaid plan will help it wring more value from its struggling Nextel unit .
Any stigma attached to the phones -- they are a common prop in any show or movie about gangs and spies -- is falling away as prices drop and the quality of the phones rises .
Prepaid carriers like MetroPCS , Virgin Mobile , and Sprint 's Boost Mobile division now offer sleeker handsets , better coverage , and more options , from 10 - cent - a - minute calling cards that customers refill as needed to $ 50 - a - month , flat - rate plans for chatterboxes who want unlimited calling , Web browsing , and text messaging .
The savings can be considerable .
An AT&T customer with an Apple iPhone on a traditional plan pays at least $ 130 a month , excluding taxes and fees , for unlimited calls and Web use .
Compared with the $ 50 - a - month , all - inclusive prepaid plans , the iPhone owner pays nearly $ 1,000 more over the course of a year .
Prepaid customers typically have to buy their phones without the subsidies offered with a contract .
When Jerry Cruz , a manager at a tanning salon in Manhattan , switched to T - Mobile 's prepaid service , he paid more than $ 300 apiece for Sidekicks , which feature keyboards and cameras , for himself and his daughter .
But , he said , he saves at least $ 40 a month compared with his previous contract with Sprint .
" Every dollar I save goes towards something else . "
MetroPCS , a carrier based in Dallas that sells only prepaid plans and just added New York and Boston to its network , said it has seen a lot of interest from people who are " cutting the cord , " or abandoning their landlines to use only a mobile phone .
" Over 80 percent of our users use our phone as their primary phone , " said Tom Keys , the company 's chief operating officer .
MetroPCS added 520,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter , the biggest quarterly gain in its six - year history .
MetroPCS finished 2008 with more than 5 million subscribers , a 35 percent increase over 2007 .
Charlie Bournis , owner of Champion Wireless in Brooklyn , said his prepaid business doubled in the last year while sales of traditional contract plans plunged .
" In 2001 , we would sell upwards of 100 contracts per month , " he said .
" Now , maybe we do 10 . "
The store sells 100 prepaid refill cards each week , he said .
Boost Mobile 's $ 50 unlimited - everything prepaid plan , introduced last month , has helped stoke demand , said Bournis .
" Over the holidays , all of our Boost Mobile handsets were just collecting dirt , " he added .
" After they announced the $ 50 plan , they sold out within a week .
It does n't make any sense to get a contract anymore . "
Prepaid plans are generally offered in two flavors .
Customers can buy pay - as - you - go cards , with $ 20 providing 60 to 200 minutes of calling time that must be used within a specified period .
Some prepaid companies also offer flat - rate monthly plans that resemble traditional plans except that customers pay upfront and have no continuing commitment .
Customers can even switch back and forth between the types of prepaid plans depending on their needs .
Wireless carriers are ambivalent about the growing popularity of prepaid services .
They would prefer to sign up customers with good credit to long - term contracts .
But as the overall mobile phone market becomes more saturated , they are looking for growth wherever they can .
Sprint and T - Mobile , the No. 3 and No. 4 carriers in the country , are particularly aggressive about courting prepaid customers .
In the fourth quarter , 355,000 of the 621,000 customers that T - Mobile added were prepaid users .
Prepaid phones are not for everyone , said Peter Pham , chief executive of BillShrink , which offers free analysis of consumers ' cell phone bills and recommends cheaper plans that match their calling patterns .
Some carriers , like MetroPCS or Leap Wireless International 's Cricket , have limited networks or charge extra for roaming outside regional zones .
The trick , he said , is for consumers to figure out their calling needs and pick the plan that make sense .
" Saving $ 15 to $ 20 a month is a big deal these days , " Pham said .

Britain's exit strategy from Iraq suffered a setback yesterday when the country 's parliament rejected a draft law paving the way for withdrawal of forces by the end of July .
The reversal was embarrassing for both Gordon Brown and the Iraqi Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , after the two leaders publicly declared last week that an agreement had been reached on the pullout .
Foreign Office sources admitted that unless the law receives formal Iraqi approval by the end of this month , when the United Nations mandate for the occupation expires , the vote could lead to British troops being confined to base , because they would not have the legal authority to do anything else in Iraq .
However , officials attempted to dampen speculation that the resolution could have such a dramatic impact , and insisted that the problem was " procedural " .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : " We have worked closely with the government of Iraq to ensure that there is a firm legal basis for the presence of our forces in 2009 .
We will now discuss with the government of Iraq what the vote in the Council of Representatives means for the proposed legal basis for the UK and other forces , and look at the options . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The possibility of British troops operating in a legal limbo from January was increased by Mr Maliki 's refusal even to start talks with the UK until after the Iraqi parliament approved the US deal on 27 November .
This reflected his anger at what he saw as Britain 's surrender of Basra to Shia militias last year .
Early this month the Secretary of State for Defence , John Hutton , warned : " I wo n't hesitate to pull [ British forces ] out .
They have to be [ legally ] protected , and the way things stand at the moment they will not be . "
His Conservative shadow , Liam Fox , said the Iraqi vote " raises serious questions " .
If another vote failed , Britain would have to ensure alternative arrangements were in place by the end of the month .
The immediate effect of the vote by the MPs to reject the draft law by 80 votes to 68 is that the UK , Australia , Romania , Estonia , El Salvador and Nato would not technically have legal authority for any use of force in Iraq , even in self - defence , after the end of the month .
Yesterday's was the first reading of the bill in the Council of Representatives , or parliament .
It is now due to be sent back to Mr Maliki 's cabinet for amendments , with another vote due next week .
Some MPs want the law dropped and replaced with an international agreement similar to the deal with the US , which lays down the terms for its withdrawal of 140,000 troops from Iraq by 2011 .
Nassir al - Issawi , an MP allied to the radical Shia cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , who wants foreign troops to leave at once , said : " What the parliament did today , rejecting the bill , was a great national achievement .
We believe that British forces and all other forces should pack their things . "
Fariad Rawndouzi , a Kurdish MP , said many of his colleagues were also unhappy with the formulation of the bill , and wanted it to resemble the " status of forces " agreement between the US and Iraq more closely .
Senior officers at the British base in Basra said a team of Foreign Office lawyers was negotiating with the Iraqi government in Baghdad , and they still hoped an agreement would be reached .
One official said : " There was always a feeling that this may go to the wire , and we must realise that it is all quite symbolic . "
There were no plans to start pulling out British troops immediately in the new year .
But Mr Maliki 's casual assurance to Mr Brown when he visited Iraq last week that all would be well may cause embarrassment to both sides .
Hakim Ali Ibrahim , an Iraqi political analyst , said : " Parliament wants to make a stand to show it should not be taken for granted .
Perhaps Maliki and Gordon Brown should not have made such a big thing out of this before they were certain everything would go through smoothly .
We have elections coming up , and the government has to do deals with the MPs . "
The provincial elections in January , the first held under sovereign , rather than occupation , laws , will be followed by a referendum on autonomy for Basra province , which could have a crucial impact on the division of its oil riches .
There are fears that the militias will attempt to use the polls to infiltrate the city again , and yesterday General Raymond Odierno , the US commander of coalition forces in Iraq , visited Basra for an election security meeting with Major General Andy Salmon , the British commander in Basra .

In today ’s New York Post there ’s a Sean Delonas cartoon that shows two policemen standing over a dead chimpanzee .
One is holding a handgun while the other says , “ They ’ll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill . ”
Al Sharpton is very offended .
But he should n’t be because the cartoon is n’t offensive , unless you ’re an ape .
Sharpton issued a statement saying :
The cartoon in today ’s New York Post is troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African - Americans as being synonymous with monkeys .
One has to question whether the cartoonist is making a less than casual reference to this when in the cartoon they have police saying after shooting a chimpanzee that “ Now they will have to find someone else to write the stimulus bill . ”
Being that the stimulus bill has been the first legislative victory of President Barack Obama ( the first African American president ) and has become synonymous with him it is not a reach to wonder are they inferring that a monkey wrote the last bill ?
Well actually , yes , it is a reach .
That ’s why the New York Post refuses to apologize and issued this statement :
The cartoon is a clear parody of a current news event , to wit the shooting of a violent chimpanzee in Connecticut .
It broadly mocks Washington ’s efforts to revive the economy .
Again , Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist .
I ’ll leave Sharpton ’s motivation alone , but this whole thing seems a little puzzling .
Consider three recent events .
January 20 : A black man is inaugurated president of the United States .
February 16 : Police shoot and kill a chimpanzee after it attacks his owner ’s friend .
February 17 : President Obama signs the $ 787 billion stimulus package into law .
It is widely seen , particularly by Republicans , as a gigantic boondoggle .
Guess which one of these is irrelevant to the cartoon ?
If you picked # 1 , you ’re right .
This cartoon has nothing to do with the ethnicity of Obama ’s father and everything to do with the fact that the stimulus bill is messy .
So messy , in fact , that it could have been written by a chimpanzee .
The truth is , it ’s not a good cartoon .
Because it is an awkward attempt to combine two unrelated news stories , it does n’t resonate , not in the way that this really wonderful cartoon does .
You many not even get the cartoon at all ( stimulus=monkey ? ) , but that ’s understandable because it ’s not that funny ; it ’s just not racist either .
Sometimes a joke about monkeys is , well , just a joke about monkeys .

The head of the International Monetary Fund has told the BBC that he expects more countries to request financial aid to survive the global slowdown .
Iceland , Hungary and Ukraine were forced last year to appeal to the organisation for aid .
IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn has warned that a second round of nations will be forced to seek IMF cash .
Separately , Germany 's finance minister said Germany might consider bailing out smaller European nations .
Germany 's Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck described the suggestion that the eurozone could fall apart as " totally absurd " and promised that if other member states got into trouble , " we will show ourselves to be capable of acting " .
Mr Steinbrueck 's comments strengthened the euro against the dollar .
One euro was worth $ 1.2760 by late afternoon from $ 1.2511 on Wednesday .
Mr Strauss - Kahn said that the crisis was " far from over " .
" There 's a real possibility that in the coming weeks or months another couple , or maybe more than that , countries will need some support , especially emerging countries , " said Mr Strauss - Kahn .
He did not specify which countries might ask for help .
' Early warning '
Mr Strauss - Kahn also said that the IMF was among the institutions which gave an " early warning " about the upcoming crisis " two or three years ago " .
" [ But ] because when you are a head of a government or a finance minister and the sky is still blue , and you have a guy coming from the outside telling you : ' The sky is blue , but what is going to happen in one year is terrible ' , you say : ' OK , lets wait for one year ' .
It 's absolutely understandable , " he said .
Mr Strauss - Kahn said there was a need for stronger multilateral institutions , with more legitimacy .
European measures
Given the risks facing the Eastern European economies , if Berlin does decide to support them , that will weigh on [ Germany 's ] finances
Yuji Saito , Societe Generale Many Eastern European countries have been in trouble in recent months amid the global financial and economic crisis , as their economies plummeted from boom to bust .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel met EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso amid speculation that Germany may announce measures to help some other European economies .
But she declined to comment specifially on the matter saying after the meeting : " The eurozone has , in fact , proven its worth in this financial crisis . "
Debating currency Poland 's finance minister said his country was considering adopting the single currency to help weather the downturn .
" Secure public finances and a quick adoption of the euro are the best way out of the crisis for Poland , " Jacek Rostowski told members of parliament .
However , central bank head Slawomir Skrzypek said on Wednesday that Poland was not ready to set out on the path to the eurozone .
He cited the weakness of the zloty , which has dropped more than 12 % against the euro since the beginning of the year .
Many Eastern European financial markets have been hit hard amid worsening economic data and an exodus of foreign investors .

The headlines say that a deal to bail out automakers stands little chance of success .
One might hope that common sense alone would have killed it ( it ’s never a good idea to throw good money at failing enterprises ) , but the Democrats are citing intense Republican opposition .
So too for the “ stimulus package ” that contains a long list of bad ideas , almost like a recipe for prolonging the downturn : bailouts , welfare , unemployment subsidies , union privileges , and other devastating devices .
Now the package is being considered largely dead .
Already the Republicans are toughening up , seeing the light of day .
After nearly a decade of signing off on horrible legislation and looking the other way as a Republican president chewed through our liberties , they are new converts to the cause of limiting the government because a Democrat will be president .
At the same time , we are witnessing the disgusting spectacle of Bush lecturing us on the merits of the free market .
After eight years of wars , the police state , bailouts , and regulations , he is newly concerned about his legacy , and so he is following the path of Hoover , who was horrible in office and better out of office .
Thus is Bush , of all people , sounding like a champion of the free society .
Already , you can see that the political constellation is lining up in a way that is more friendly to the cause of liberty .
The Democrats are up to their old tricks , which are transparently dumb and dated .
The Republicans are responding with smart and sound criticisms .
The government looks poised for a fantastic gridlock that will let the liquidation take place so that we can move toward a good recovery .
There is plenty to regret about Obama ’s victory , but the first impressions of the political dynamic that is playing out looks like it could mean good things for the future .
I do n’t know if it is inspiring or just disgusting or what , but Bush ’s speech on Wall Street is worth quoting in full :
Government intervention is not a cure - all … History has shown that the greater threat to economic prosperity is not too little government involvement in the market , it is too much government involvement in the market … .
Our aim should not be more government … the surest path to that growth is free markets and free people ….
move forward with the free market principles that have delivered prosperity and hope to people all across the globe . …
Capitalism offers people the freedom to choose where they work and what they do , the opportunity to buy or sell products they want , and the dignity that comes with profiting from their talent and hard work .
The free market system provides the incentives that lead to prosperity — the incentive to work , to innovate , to save , to invest wisely , and to create jobs for others .
And as millions of people pursue these incentives together , whole societies benefit .
Free market capitalism is far more than economic theory .
It is the engine of social mobility — the highway to the American Dream .
It ’s what makes it possible for a husband and wife to start their own business , or a new immigrant to open a restaurant , or a single mom to go back to college and to build a better career .
It is what allowed entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to change the way the world sells products and searches for information .
It ’s what transformed America from a rugged frontier to the greatest economic power in history — a nation that gave the world the steamboat and the airplane , the computer and the CAT scan , the Internet and the iPod .
Ultimately , the best evidence for free market capitalism is its performance compared to other economic systems .
Free markets allowed Japan , an island with few natural resources , to recover from war and grow into the world ’s second - largest economy .
Free markets allowed South Korea to make itself into one of the most technologically advanced societies in the world .
Free markets turned small areas like Singapore and Hong Kong and Taiwan into global economic players .
Today , the success of the world ’s largest economies comes from their embrace of free markets .
Meanwhile , nations that have pursued other models have experienced devastating results .
Soviet communism starved millions , bankrupted an empire , and collapsed as decisively as the Berlin Wall .
Cuba , once known for its vast fields of cane , is now forced to ration sugar .
And while Iran sits atop giant oil reserves , its people cannot put enough gasoline — in their cars .
The record is unmistakable :
If you seek economic growth , if you seek opportunity , if you seek social justice and human dignity , the free market system is the way to go .
And it would be a terrible mistake to allow a few months of crisis to undermine 60 years of success .
Bush is n’t alone here .
All the Republican leadership is sounding human again , making sensible points about the idea of a bailout of GM , Ford , Chrysler , and the UAW , and other pressure will follow .
Back up a bit to try to understand why divided government , even when it is divided among evil people , is better than unified government .
Ralph Raico makes the point at every opportunity that the reason that the medieval period gave rise to liberty is that there was no power center on earth .
The state was in competition with the Church and a thousand tiny governments were in competition with each other .
Power was diffuse , and though any center would have been glad to have it all , the diffusion of power created a kind of gridlock that permitted liberty to grow and thrive .
So too with divided power in any government .
They can and do logroll to each other ’s mutual benefit , but when that process breaks down , it is a glorious thing .
Recent history suggests that the logrolling between power centers is least effective when the Republicans are in the minority and the Democrats hold the presidency .
The Clinton years are a case in point .
Spending rose very little .
Warfare was curbed relative to the past and present .
Deficits fell .
The public sector shrank .
This is the great hope of the next four years .
The transition period seems to be signaling some very good changes , provided panic can be kept at bay , and the Republicans keep making sense .

“ The year : 2500 AD .
The ‘ Phoenix Five ’ .
The crew : Captain Roke , Ensign Adam Hargreaves , Cadet Tina Kulbrick , and their computeroid Karl .
Their mission : to patrol the outer galaxies for Earth Space Control , to maintain peace , and to capture Zodian the humanoid , who with the aid of his computers Alpha and Zeta endeavours to become dictator of outer space . ”
Growing up I always aware of British science fiction TV shows thanks to PBS , but I had no idea that there were a number of home grown space operas from Australia .
On such show that had escaped my radar is Phoenix Five which was produced in 1969 and ran for 26 episodes in 1970 .
Sadly this series has n’t made it to DVD yet , but from what little I ’ve seen you can tell the show was slightly on the low budget side to say the least although from what little I ’ve seen on YouTube its seems to have a certain kitsch charm to it .
Here are the opening and closing titles to give you a flavor :
While Phoenix
Five does n’t quite have the originality and drama of a BBC series — the sheer cheesy quality of series makes it a cult classic to me , in fact one regrets that it never got the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment .
The first thing that hits your eye is that the visual style of the show is kit bashed from everything you can think of :
The costumes have a Star Trek quality to them , the robot looks borrowed from Dr. Who and the industrial design of the spaceship is a throwback to either Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon film serials :
From what I could find out about the series was that it was uneven at best ( as you can see from the videos ) .
My understanding is that one of the problems of the series was that the scripts would vary a great deal from clever to just plain silly — in fact actress Patsy Trench who played spunky Cadet Tina Kulbrick once complained in an interview “ The script writers were n’t even aware of the capabilities of the space ship , and nobody seemed to know what was going on ” .
Although that said with age one can say that the clichéd quality of the dialog ( which is just one notch above porn ) and the thin soap opera plot are strangely compelling .
It ’s like eating a bag of potato chips — you know it ’s bad for you but you just ca n’t stop once you ’ve started :
As rage coursed through India after the Mumbai terrorist bombings , Condoleezza Rice , the Bush administrations Secretary of State , flew to India and cautioned the Indian government on avoiding a knee jerk and counterproductive response .
She warned the Indians that any response needs to be judged by its effectiveness in prevention and also by not creating other unintended consequences or difficulties . 
This lecture is laughable after the Bush administrations over - the - top reaction to 9/11 was to declare a massive global war on terror ; create a fictional and cartoonish axis of evil ; and invade and occupy two Muslim countries all of which actually fueled Islamist terrorism worldwide .
( Given these same facts , the U.S. criticism of Russias temporary invasion of one - third of Georgia in response to that nations initiation of hostilities in South Ossetia , which killed Russian soldiers , was equally drenched in hypocrisy . )
And the disproportionate U.S. response to terrorism continues .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently warned that the United States will face its biggest threats not from aggressive nation - states , but from guerrillas and terrorists in failed states .
To combat these threats , the Department of Defense has just raised such irregular warfare to equal status with conventional warfare .
It apparently just dawned on the Pentagons leadership that most of the wars fought by the United States during the post - World War II period have been such low level conflicts .
Michael Vickers , the Pentagons assistant secretary for special operations and low intensity warfare , is now talking of a worldwide network made up of U.S. and friendly forces to conduct steady state counterterrorism operations , in order to create a persistent , ubiquitous presence against our adversaries ...
In other words , conducting perpetual war for perpetual peace .
The nations founders , leery of the costs in blood and treasure of the constant warfare that European kings inflicted on their people , would pass out at this notion especially when the average Americans chances of ever being killed by an international terrorist attack are statistically less than being struck by lightning .
However , it has not yet occurred to the Pentagon ( probably because such a realization would not be in the militarys interest ) or the U.S. public that messing around militarily in failed states , especially Muslim ones , is what generates the anti-U.S. hatred that leads terrorists to attack U.S. targets .
Yet the people of other countries seem aware that military activities abroad may make their homeland less secure .
For example , in Spain after the massive train bombing on March 11 , 2004 , the Joe Maria Aznar government , which had been one of the few European governments that avidly supported and helped with Bushs invasion of Iraq , had to lie to its people that the bombing was likely the work of Basque separatists , when it had evidence that the Islamists were behind it .
Why ?
Because if the Spanish people found out that Islamists had perpetrated the attack , the Spanish government knew that the public would correctly see that Spanish foreign policy had endangered the Spanish homeland .
Thus , the Spanish government would be put at risk .
Of course , the truth eventually came out anyway , the deceitful Spanish government was justifiably thrown out of office , and Spanish forces were withdrawn from Iraq .
In contrast to such lucid thinking , politicians and the media in the United States deliberately stoke excessive fears of terrorism so that they can get government funding for their pork projects or attract more viewers , listeners , or readers .
For example , a congressional mandated commission headed by two former senators recently reached the alarmist conclusion that it is more likely than not that a weapon of mass destruction will be used in a terrorist attack somewhere in the world by the end of 2013 .
How the panel could come up with such a specific estimate of an event that has an essentially unknowable probability ( only two major WMD attacks by terrorist groups or individuals have occurred in history the gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995 and the anthrax attacks in the U.S. in 2001 ) should raise suspicions .
In addition , the commission concluded that an attack with a biological agent was more probable than one with a nuclear weapon and that the U.S. government thus should increase regulation of the 400 U.S. research facilities and 15,000 people working with such organisms .
No mention was made that even a biological attack is difficult to carry out successfully ( the Japanese terrorist group that perpetrated the pathetically ineffective chemical attack on the subway , which should have been easier to carry out than a biological attack , had boat loads of money , had hired top notch scientists , and had failed at committing biological terrorism ) or that threat of biological terrorism has been made worse in the wake of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks by multiplying the number of facilities working on antidotes and vaccines for biological attacks .
After all , the anthrax attacks , again killing only a few people , originated from anthrax stored at a U.S. government facility and used by scientists with special expertise in biological weapons agents .
Thus , irrational fear breeds irrational and hypocritical responses .
Hopefully , India will respond to the Mumbai attacks by adopting the more rational Spanish model and not the hysterical U.S. model .
.. there are many words for what ’s being done here .
What happened is : American taxpayers were swindled out of a huge chunk of money and the Fed does n’t like answering questions .
Bloomberg reports :
The Federal Reserve refused a request by Bloomberg News to disclose the recipients of more than $ 2 trillion of emergency loans from U.S. taxpayers and the assets the central bank is accepting as collateral .
( Read full article )
Bloomberg met with all kinds of resistance from the Fed which basically claims giving out details would make the financial crisis even badder .
The Financial system was based upon trust they say .
Trust .
What trust ?
So , they are throwing out trillions of dollars like ticker tape on a parade , but since the dollars are your dollars you are not allowed to know any details .
On the other hand there is an ailing car industry .
Yes I know .
It is their own fault and all that , but it is American ’s jobs being lost there , a lot of American jobs .
They claimed they need a comparatively meagre $ 25 billion and now even the sum of $ 14 billion was rejected by Senate Republicans , because workers would n’t agree to lower their wages .
Wages which would be used to bolster the demand side of economy , if you think economically .
Wages which make sure those people can live decently off the income they worked for , if you think like a fellow human being .
You ’re not only being bamboozled , conned , hoodwinked , hornswoggled .
This amounts to the assassination of the American middle class , or rather what ’s left of it .
The phenomenon is not an American only , however , Switzerland just bailed out it ’s largest bank UBS with 6 billion Swiss Francs and bought up some poisonous assets for some 60 billion , but when the Swiss cabinet asks for an economic stimulus package ..
Well you can ’tr really do that in a free market society , can you ?

Advertisement Israel has carried out an air attack in Gaza and sent tanks into the Strip , after Palestinian militants killed an Israeli soldier .
Palestinian sources said there had been fighting near Khan Younis in southern Gaza .
Israeli troops pulled back across the border several hours later .
It was the worst violence in Gaza since Israel 's offensive against Hamas ended with both sides declaring ceasefires .
Israel closed the crosssings into Gaza on Tuesday , preventing access for aid .
An Israeli soldier on patrol in a vehicle was killed by an explosive device deliberately planted on Israel 's side of the border near the Kissufim crossing , prompting troops to open fire into Gaza .
The explosion was reportedly filmed by the militants , as was gun fire and a grenade blast .
Three soldiers were injured in the attack .
Israeli troops fired into the Gaza Strip in retaliation , as a result of which Palestinian officials said a farmer was killed .
Heavy fighting was reported in Khan Younis , south of the Kissufim crossing , and many people had fled their homes .
Palestinian sources say 20 Israeli tanks and seven army bulldozers made an incursion .
Two people were also wounded in an Israeli air strike in Khan Younis .
Hospital sources say one was a member of Hamas ' Popular Resistance Committee who was on a motorbike at the time , and the other was a passer - by .
It was Israel 's first air strike since the end of its offensive against Hamas .
There has been Israeli artillery and naval fire against Gaza targets since the ceasefires were announced .
Later Palestinians said there had been another Israeli air attack on tunnels used to smuggle goods and weapons into Gaza from Egypt .
They reported hearing a big explosion .
Israel closed border crossings into Gaza because of the attack on the patrol , Israeli officials said , stopping the flow of aid supplies to Gaza 's 1.5 million residents .
Aid agencies have been struggling to meet the urgent needs of tens of thousands of displaced , homeless and injured people in Gaza .
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Gaza says that although the latest fighting has been much less intense than that of earlier this month , it is a reminder that until a long - term truce agreement is drawn up , those levels of violence could return .
US visit
The fresh fighting came as US President Barack Obama 's Middle East envoy , George Mitchell , arrived in the region to seek a more permanent truce .

He was expected to hold talks with Egyptian officials , who have been mediating between Israel and Hamas , before travelling on to Jerusalem and Ramallah .
In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the US supported " Israel 's right to self - defence " .
" The rocket barrages which are getting closer and closer to populated areas ( in Israel ) cannot go unanswered , " she said in her first news conference at the State Department .
Israel and Hamas declared separate ceasefires on 17 and 18 January , ending an Israeli offensive in which nearly 1,300 Palestinians and 10 Israeli soldiers were killed .
Three Israeli civilians were killed by rocket fire from Gaza in the same period .
Israel said its objective to stop militant rocket fire into Israel had been fulfilled .
When Hamas called its ceasefire , it said Israel had one week to fully open all the crossings into Gaza , in order to end an 18 - month blockade of the territory that has crippled its economy .
Israel wants guarantees that Hamas militants will not re-arm via smuggling tunnels under the border with Egypt .

Indeed , his prosthesis concept manages to be both .
The Corian - plated limb features two dome joints that offer a wider range of motion than a real arm while still managing , at least in my eyes , to be as much an accessory as it is a medical device .
Imagine if this arm had been covered in a pseudo - flesh toned rubber .
Your brain would acknowledge the piece as something that did n't fit .
Maybe because this arm is n't trying to look real , my brain accepts it as part of the image with ease .

Important -- How to Setup SSL on Gmail
The old Gmail Hack -- fixed
Is it possible for someone to create a malicious filter without having access to your Gmail username and password ?
No , however they can force you to create the filter without your knowledge .
The blogosphere is buzzing about a Gmail Security Flaw that has caused some people to lose their domain names registered through GoDaddy .
To understand how this exploit works let me first explain how I would carry it out ( if I were a blackhat ) .
Then we can move on and explain the exploit in detail .
Let ’s use a current example and assume that I was trying to steal MakeUseOf.com and I already knew it was registered by GoDaddy .
Let ’s also assume that I knew the owner ’s Gmail address .
I would want to create a filter like the one in the image above , where all email sent from GoDaddy Support was automatically deleted and forwarded to my email address .
Once the filter was setup I would simply head on over to GoDaddy ’s Customer Number Retrieval page and enter a little info .
Once I press continue an email is sent to the domain owner ’s email address but since I ’ve setup a filter he never sees it in his inbox .
Instead , it is sent to the trash and forwarded to my email address .
With the GoDaddy Account Number I can now proceed to the GoDaddy Password Retrieval page .
Once again I simply press continue and an email containing an Authorization Code is sent the the owner ’s email address but the filter deletes it immediately and forwards it on to me .
I now have the ability to take over this person ’s GoDaddy account and transfer MakeUseOf.com or any domain within that account to my registrar .
Exploit in Detail
http://mail.google.com/mail/ ?ui=2 &ik=ad7df7dc23 * Unique Account Identifier * &at=xn3j35svndkg48yp2qgmpt99ivcqdc * Session Authorization Key * &view=up &act=cf &rt=h &zx=pjo6fg-k2ljzh&search=cf &cf1_from=support%40godaddy.com &cf2_emc=true&cf2_email=hacker%40hacker.com &cf2_tr=true
So how do we go about creating this filter in the first place ?
When you create a filter in your Gmail account , a request is sent to Google ’s servers to be processed .
The request is made in the form of a url with many variables .
For security reasons , your browser does n’t display all the variables contained within the url .
Using FireFox and a plugin called Live HTTP Headers , you can see exactly what variables are sent from your browser to Google ’s servers .
Here is an example of a request url sent to Google to create a filter exactly like the one in the image above .
I ’ve broken down the url by variable so it ’s easier to read :
Through a process of elimination you can determine the role of each variable .
I have highlighted the two most important variables , ik & at .
The ik variable is the equivalent of a username , each account has one and it never changes .
Obtaining this variable is tricky but possible .
I ’m not going to tell you how to do it , if you search hard enough online you ’ll find out how .
Obtaining the at variable on the other hand can be done by tricking a user into visiting a page that contains malicious code that subsequently steals a cookie from the user called GMAIL_AT which is the same as the at variable , just named differently .
Once the cookie is stolen the malicious code creates a hidden iframe with a url containing the variables that authorize Gmail to create a filter for your account .
What Google can do to prevent this attack from resurfacing ?
Instead of having the at variable expire after each session , they should have the at variable expire after each request .
What you should do if you have a Gmail Account ?
Check your filters and make sure that nothing seems out of the ordinary .
If you ’re using Firefox , you can download an extension called NoScript which helps to prevent you from becoming a victim of one of these attacks .
Overall , though , be cautious .
Why am I sharing this information with you ?
Well …
Google has a way of fixing credible threats right away AND unless you ’re extremely familiar with manipulating the purpose of software , it ’s going to be difficult .

" ... You declare , my friend ; that you do not hate the Jews , you are merely ' anti- Zionist ' .
And I say , let the truth ring forth from the high mountain tops , let it echo through the valleys of G - D's green earth :
When people criticize Zionism , they mean Jews -- this is G - D's own truth .
" Anti-Semitism , the hatred of the Jewish people , has been and remains a blot on the soul of mankind .
In this we are in full agree - ment .
So know also this : anti-Zionist is inherently anti-Semitic , and ever will be so .
" Why is this ?
You know that Zionism is nothing less than the dream and ideal of the Jewish people returning to live in their own land .
The Jewish people , the Scriptures tell us , once enjoyed a flourishing Commonwealth in the Holy Land .
From this they were expelled by the Roman tryant , the same Romans who cruelly murdered our L - RD .
Driven from their homeland , their nation in ashes , forced to wander the globe , the Jewish people time and again suffered the lash of whichever tyrant happened to rule over them .
" The Negro people , my friend , know what it is to suffer the torment of tyranny under rulers not of our choosing .
Our brothers in Africa have begged , pleaded , requested -- DEMANDED -- the recognition and realization of our inborn right to live in peace under our own sovereignty in our own country .
" How easy it should be , for anyone who holds dear this inalienable right of all mankind , to understand and support the right of the Jewish People to live in their ancient Land of Israel .
All men of good will exult in the fulfillment of G - D's promise , that His people should return in joy to rebuild their plundered land .
This is Zionism , nothing more , nothing less .
" And what is anti-Zionist ?
It is the denial to the Jewish people of a fundamental right that we justly claim for the people of Africa and freely accord all other nations of the Globe .
It is discrimination against Jews , my friend , because they are Jews .
In short , it is anti-Semitism .
" The anti-Semite rejoices at any opportunity to vent his malice .
The times have made it unpopular , in the West , to proclaim openly a hatred of the Jews .
This being the case , the anti-Semite must constantly seek new forms and forums for his poison .
How he must revel in the new masquerrade !
He does not hate the Jews , he is just ' anti- Zionist ' !
" My friend , I do not accuse you of deliberate anti-Semitism .
I know you feel , as I do , a deep love of truth and justice and revulsion for racism , prejudice , and discrimination .
But I know you have been misled -- as others have been -- into thinking you can be ' anti- Zionist ' and yet remain true to those heartfelt principles that you and I share .
Let my words echo in the depths of your soul :
When people criticize Zionism , they mean Jews -- make no mistake about it . "

The Real Newsanalyzes the political climate that led to the Israeli assault on Gaza , looking at how elections in Israel have affected the timing of the war :
As Inauguration Day looms , people around the world are looking for ways to keep up with the goings on without having to be strapped to a couch in front of the TV .
Similar to what we did on Election Day , the Ars staff thought we would hunt around for ways to follow President - elect Obama 's swearing in and the following festivities online and on - the - go .
Luckily , if you have an Internet connection and a fully - functional browser , the world is pretty much your oyster .
The NBC - owned Hulu plans to offer a live stream of the Presidential Inauguration directly from its website ( which can also be embedded on your own website or blog ) .
Hulu is undoubtedly going to be one of the most popular options for online inaugural viewing tomorrow ; however , if you 're looking for somewhere else to go in the event that Hulu comes crashing down , C - Span also plans to offer multiple video feeds on its website through the " C - Span Inauguration Hub . "
In fact , C - Span already has a few video feeds up as video crews test things out before the festivities begin .
Joost also plans to offer a live video stream of the inauguration ( offered through CBS ) .
Now that Joost no longer requires a special desktop player to watch , all you need is a working web browser with Flash installed .
And , of course , CNN will offer a live video stream of the event , combined with relevant updates from Facebook users logged into Facebook Connect .
Finally , PIC2009.org is the official site for the Presidential Inauguration Committee , and it will also be offering a live stream ( via Microsoft 's Silverlight ) of the events as they happen .
What if you 're out and about ?
Not everyone plans to be in front of a computer tomorrow during the inaugural activities .
If you have a phone that can play Flash videos , then the above options are still available to you — hooray !
If you have an iPhone that can't play Flash though ( boo , hiss ) , you still have some video options .
UStream.tv , which will offer a video feed of the inauguration on its website , also plans to release an iPhone application that will stream the event live .
Previewed to TechCrunch last week , the iPhone app will not only display the live video feed in an iPhone - friendly format , it will also let users participate in the live chat about the video .
Unfortunately , it does n't look like the UStream iPhone app is available on the App Store yet , so they had better get crackin ' or else users will have to look elsewhere tomorrow .
Update : The UStream iPhone app has finally been approved and is available on the App Store now .
But what if you do n't want a video feed ?
Say you 're out with friends and all you want are casual , non-moving updates ( you know , in case something totally insane happens , like the entire country gets Rickrolled ) .
NPR 's Inauguration Report website and iPhone app offer a collection of user updates pulled from Twitter , Flickr , SMS , and more .
Following this stream will let you keep up with the goings on as if you were there , thanks to kind Internet citizens providing live updates to NPR .
January 20 is sure to be a high - energy day for everyone involved in Obama 's inauguration , so good luck following along !

Barack Obama will put forward retired Gen. Eric Shinseki as Secretary of Veterans Affairs in his cabinet ..
WaPo quoted me :
‘ Juan Cole , a University of Michigan history professor who writes about the Iraq war and Islam , called Shinseki ’s appointment ironic .
“ If Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and [ former undersecretary for defense Douglas J. ]
Feith had listened to Shinseki , there would n’t be as many wounded veterans to take care of , ” Cole said .
“ I think this is a way of saying , ‘ Here was a career officer who had valuable insights who was shunted aside by arrogant civilians , and we ’re not going to make the same kind of mistakes . ’ ” ‘
Let us just use the professor ’s wayback machine and look at the testimony in February 2003 and the reaction from then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz .
Here is what Shinseki told the Senate Armed Forces Committee on 25 February 2003 , about the force level required in Iraq after the Baath government was overthrown :
‘ I would say that what ’s been mobilized to this point — something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers are probably , you know , a figure that would be required .
We ’re talking about post - hostilities control over a piece of geography that ’s fairly significant , with the kinds of ethnic tensions that could lead to other problems .
And so it takes a significant ground - force presence to maintain a safe and secure environment , to ensure that people are fed , that water is distributed , all the normal responsibilities that go along with administering a situation like this . ”
Note that Shinseki was aware of how big Iraq is ( 168,753 square miles or about the size of California ) ; he was aware that there would be “ ethnic tensions ” after the fall of the Baath ; and he cared about preventing looting ( “ safe and secure environment ” ) and about people having food and potable water .
Some of the military duties he mentioned are required of occupying militaries by international law .
Rumsfeld either did not know or did not care about any of these considerations .
Tim Russert later suggested that Shinseki was talking about 200,000 troops , the number in theater in February when he spoke .
But I do know English , and “ several hundred thousand ” does not mean “ two hundred thousand . ”
Shinseki was retired in summer of 2003 .
Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz pointedly did not attend his retirement ceremony .
He wrote an 8 page letter to Rumsfeld that has never been published , explaining to him that the military is made up of people , not high concept buzz words .
Rumsfeld was clearly furious with Shinseki ’s testimony , because he and the administration were low - balling the American people about the cost of the Iraq War .
It would just be $ 50 billion .
They would just send in a relatively small expeditionary force , take out Saddam and get out not so long thereafter .
The war would pay for itself .
The Army would be miraculously transformed into the Navy Seals .
Small .
Agile .
No need to take , hold and administer territory .
Then Shinseki comes out , for all the world like the honest car salesman who spoils everything by putting taxes and transportation fees and the cost of extras back into the price estimate on an automobile after the other salesmen have enticed the customer with a stripped down , unrealistic price ( this practice is called low - balling ) .
Here is Rumsfeld ’s first response :
‘Q : Secretary Rumsfeld , yesterday you attempted to provide some — Rumsfeld : ( Inaudible ) — I take it .
Q : — near - perfect clarity for the nuance in General Shinseki ’s comments about the need for a — size of a post - Iraq force .
Nevertheless , critics of the Pentagon are seizing on Shinseki ’s comment , his opinion , as evidence that the Pentagon may be underplaying or under - representing what the post - war commitment will be .
And General Shinseki — some of his aides are telling us that he sort of stands by his opinion that he offered that — have you —
Rumsfeld : I ’ve not talked to him .
( To General Myers ) Have you ?
Myers : I have not talked to General Shinseki either .
Q : Well —
Rumsfeld : First of all , people are entitled to their own opinions .
Q : Well , do you find that unhelpful , and do you plan to discuss it at all with him ?
Rumsfeld : I do n’t know .
I ’m sure I ’ll see him .
I see him every week for one reason or another .
And I ’m sure it will come up .
But you mean did I pick up the phone yesterday and ask him to come and see me or call — Q : To discuss whether or not this is helpful to your case .
Rumsfeld :
The — well , if he ’s right , it ’s helpful .
My personal view is that it will prove to be high .
The problem we have is that anyone who tries to go to a single point answer has to have made a series of judgments about a set of six to eight variables , and he has to in their mind decided , well , this is how that variable is going to be decided , and therefore , I can come to a single point answer .
I ’m not deft enough to take six or eight working variables — ‘
Rumsfeld always masked his ideological commitments by pretending an issue was too complex to talk about clearly .
It was n’t 7 or 8 working variables , whatever that even means .
Shinseki was analogizing from the actual experience of NATO forces in the Balkans .
For x number of an occupied population you need y numbers of troops if order was n’t to immediately break down .
On February 28 , Rumsfeld had become more assertive , according to AFX.com :
‘” However , I will say this … what is … reasonably certain is the idea that it would take several hundred thousand US forces is far from the mark . ”
Rumsfeld said the US has “ no idea how long the war will last .
We do n’t know to what extent there may or may not be weapons of mass destruction used .
We do n’t have any idea whether or not there would be ethnic strife . ”
“ We do n’t know exactly how long it would take to find weapons of mass destruction and destroy them , ” he said .
“ The reality is that we already have a number of countries that have offered to participate with their forces in stabilization activities in the event force has to be used .
“ It ’s not logical to me , ” he said , that it would take as many forces in the aftermath of a war “ as it would to win the war … any idea that it ’s several hundred thousand for any sustained period is simply not the case . ” ‘
A ) If you do n’t know all the things Rumsfeld said he did n’t know , you do n’t go to war .
And B ) it is entirely logical that an occupation of 27 million people would take more troops than merely defeating a demoralized and poorly trained and equipped Iraqi army .
In fact , we now know that Rumsfeld wanted to go into Iraq , lop off the head of the regime , install Ahmad Chalabi as soft dictator , and get all US troops save one division out by the following October .
Rumsfeld was right that a long occupation was undesirable .
But his plan could only have worked if he had kept the Iraqi army in existence and gone with someone more acceptable to them than Chalabi .
The plan was self - contradictory , impractical and deeply flawed .
Wolfowitz attacked Shinseki two days after the general ’s testimony , on February 27 :
‘ “ There has been a good deal of comment — some of it quite outlandish — about what our postwar requirements might be in Iraq .
Some of the higher end predictions we have been hearing recently , such as the notion that it will take several hundred thousand U.S. troops to provide stability in post - Saddam Iraq , are wildly off the mark .
It is hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post - Saddam Iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself and to secure the surrender of Saddam ’s security forces and his army — hard to imagine . ” * House Budget Committee testimony on Iraq ( February 27 , 2003 ) ’
Wolfowitz clearly was trashing Shinseki because he wanted a small force to go into Iraq , put in Chalabi the Corrupt , and get right back out .
Wolfowitz gave an interview with Ghida Fakhry of Lebanese Television on March , 2003 , in which he said ( State Department NEWS TRANSCRIPT Department of Defense Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz March 26 , 2003 ( Interview with Ghita Fawkry [ sic ] , Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation ) :
‘ Wolfowitz : War is a terrible thing .
We ’ve tried every other means to achieve objectives without a war because we understand what the price of a war can be and what it is .
But the truth is the horrors of peace in Iraq under this dictator are actually far worse than war .
We ’ve taken great care to avoid hitting civilians .
That does n’t mean we succeed every time , but we ’ve taken great care in that respect .
. .
I hear sometimes nonsense about how this is a war for oil .
If the United States had wanted access to Iraq ’s oil all we had to do 12 years ago was to abandon any policy toward Saddam Hussein and just do commercial business with him .
I hear sometimes that this is a war for Israel .
This is not a war for Israel at all .
It is an opportunity , I believe , to put the lie to those people who say there are n’t any democracies in the Arab world because Arabs are incapable of democracy .
. .
Iraq is a country that is rich in natural resources .
Even more important it ’s a country that ’s rich in human talent .
Unfortunately too much of that talent has been driven out of the country by Saddam Hussein .
But I do n’t think the Iraqi people are going to need the United States or the United Nations or any foreign force for very long once they ’re given the chance to create their own institutions . ’
Wolfowitz was wrong about everything .
It is nearly 6 years later and there are still 150,000 or so US troops in Iraq , and 4000 British .
He thought that the Iraqi National Congress , with the leader of which –Ahmad Chalabi– he had done some sort of corrupt political deal , would just waltz in and take over from the Baath Party .
But the INC had no grass roots in Iraq .
By the way , the reason that the United States could not do commercial business with Saddam Hussein in the 1990s was that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee had successfully lobbied Congress to put tight sanctions on that country , and efforts by oil excecutives such as Dick Cheney to argue Congress out of such unilateral sanctions so that US petroleum companies could develop new fields in the Middle East were a miserable failure .
Wolfowitz knew this when he made that dishonest argument to Ms. Fakhry .
Wolfowitz ’s paternalistic idea that an American military occupation could demonstrate what Arabs were capable of is bizarre .
What Wolfowitz did was convince a whole generation of Arabs that they should at any cost avoid doing anything that would reproduce a situation in their countries like that in American Iraq .
And then there is the sad , sad situation of some 36,000 US troops who were wounded in Iraq badly enough to go to hospital , along with thousands more who have brain trauma not recognized at the time .
Wolfowitz ’s boilerplate about how horrible war is will do them no good .
The cost to the US public of two divisions of wounded will probably come to $ 2 trillion over the decades .
Gen . Shinseki , disregarded at a crucial moment by civilian ideologues , will now have the opportunity to look after the Vets .
In tomorrow ’s special Inauguration editions of The Washington Post , the American Humanist Association will be running the following full - page ad :
The ad uses Barack Obama ’s own words about his Humanist mother to show that you can indeed raise excellent , moral , hard - working children without resorting to religion .
“ We hear so much these days about how traditional religious family values are necessary for raising moral children who can grow into accomplished adults , ” said American Humanist Association Executive Director Roy Speckhardt , father of two .
“ But we humanists have known for a long , long time that ethical humanist values build character .
The number of moral and accomplished humanists is legion .
We ’ve been honoring the greatest of them every year since 1953 at our annual conferences .
Now Barack Obama has given us the opportunity to share this truth with those from around the country who come to our nation ’s capital to share in the inauguration experience . ”
While not asking for donations , the ad may end up paying for itself .
Here ’s hoping that people who need to see the ad do see it .
Even better , read the Post tomorrow while sitting on an Atheist Bus .
Double whammy !
Do n’t forget the Freedom From Religion Foundation will also have a quarter - page ad in the same newspaper .

The tragic story of how a white girl being born black tore a family apart
Although both Sandra Laing 's parents were white South Africans , she looked black
Sandra Laing had been doing her sums quietly when a boy was sent to fetch her from her classroom .
In the principal 's office , two khaki- uniformed officers were waiting .
' I'm afraid you 're going to have to leave us , ' the principal told her .
He offered no explanation , and nor did the police officers who escorted her off the premises .
It was March 10 , 1966 .
On Robben Island , in the sea off Cape Town , Nelson Mandela was serving the second year of a life sentence for sabotage .
And through a quirk of genetics , ten - year - old Sandra was about to become another potent symbol of a nation built on race and prejudice .
Her parents , Abraham and Sannie Laing , were white - indeed , as members of the Nationalist Party , they were fervent supporters of South Africa 's apartheid regime - and yet their daughter undeniably looked black , with her brown skin and tightly curled hair .
Her African features were almost certainly a throwback to an unknown ancestor whose DNA , having lain dormant for generations , had emerged in her .
But when Sandra was a schoolgirl , this aspect of genetics was unknown and there was no such thing as a DNA test .
There was only the cruel and relentless gossip suggesting that her mother had had an affair with a black man .
For four years , teachers and the parents of other pupils at her all - white primary school had fought to have her expelled on the grounds that she was of mixed race .
Finally , they had succeeded .
Her two brothers still refuse to see her
The story of Sandra Laing - of how she was reclassified as ' coloured ' by the government and how her parents , insisting that she was their biological child , took their battle to keep her ' white ' all the way to the Supreme Court - caused an international furore .
Even today , hers is a name with which most South Africans are familiar .
But only one person knows the true cost of the decision , that day , to hound a girl from her school , and that is Sandra herself .
Four decades on - and 19 years after the dismantling of the apartheid regime - her life remains an extraordinary quest for identity .
A fascinating new book by journalist Judith Stone reveals the full extent of the psychological traumas Sandra endured .
As a confused teenager she eloped with a black man , causing her parents to disown her .
She went on to suffer domestic violence , destitution and the death of one of her six children .
Although reunited with her mother , she was never reconciled with her father and to this day , her two brothers refuse to see her .
Sandra and her mother were finally reconciled not long before the older woman 's death
Now 53 , Sandra is the daughter of shopkeepers from the Eastern Transvaal ( since renamed Mpumalanga ) .
Abraham Laing and his wife , Sannie , could see from the moment she was born that her skin was darker than their own and that of her elder brother Leon , yet they refused to acknowledge what was in front of them .
' My father told me I was white .
He thought of me as his white little girl , ' Sandra says .
Both Sannie , who is of Dutch descent , and Abraham , whose family originated from Germany , could trace back their white ancestry through several generations .
As Afrikaners , they had been indoctrinated in the Boer belief that to be white was pure and that people of mixed race were unstable and less intelligent .
They kept Sandra out of the sun and , in their rural community , no one drew attention to her toffee - coloured complexion until she started school .
Sandra remembers , early in her first year at primary school , a group of girls began teasing her incessantly .
They called her ' Blackie ' and ' Frizzhead ' and refused to use the water fountain after she 'd drunk from it .
In the communal showers , her tormentors would say : ' Look , she 's dirty all over ! '
Her mother told her not to worry about it , but still Sannie sent off for a bottle of hair straightener which burned like battery acid .
Patches of Sandra 's hair fell out , and when it grew back , it was as curly as ever .
The rumours that Sannie must have slept with a black man were rife and , consequently , the entire family were shunned at church and on the streets .
Local parents began to take their children out of the school , and the principal wrote to the education authorities declaring himself certain that Sandra was of mixed blood .
' It was illegal to even kiss a member of another race '
For Abraham , the idea that his wife might have consorted with a black man , making him the most humiliated of cuckolds , was unthinkable ( under South Africa 's Immorality Acts , it was illegal to have sex with , or even kiss , a member of another race ) .
Unpleasant , but far more bearable was the suggestion that he or his wife had a non-white branch near the root of their family tree .
' If her appearance is due to some " coloured blood " in either of us , then it must be very far back among our forebears , and neither of us is aware of it , ' he declared .
Such an argument turns out to be entirely conceivable .
According to research published in the early Seventies , about 8 per cent of the genes of any modern Afrikaner are non-white .
More recent studies put the number slightly higher , at 11 per cent .
Of the 25,000 or so genes that determine inheritable characteristics , only a tiny fraction have to do with skin colour , hair texture and other visible markers of race .
Abraham and Sannie could not call upon such scientific evidence .
Back then , no paternity test could prove beyond doubt that Abraham was Sandra 's father .
But a blood test that could rule out paternity was available .
He underwent it willingly , and the test established that he was , indeed , potentially Sandra 's father .
Both he and Sannie signed an affidavit swearing that they were Sandra 's biological parents .
Sandra remains adamant that her mother would n't have cheated on her father .
' My father was boss , and my mother would n't do that , ' she says .
She offers up her own evidence - photographs of herself with her baby brother , Adriaan , taken when Sandra was 11 and Adriaan was a year old .
The likeness is startling .
Adriaan 's baby hair is the same froth of tight curls , but his skin just light enough for him to have escaped Sandra 's fate .
For 18 months , the Laings battled against their daughter 's reclassification - at first losing their case in the Supreme Court , and then , to their relief , receiving a letter from the Home Affairs minister to say the decision had been reversed .
Although Sandra was officially ' white ' again , nine schools refused to take her and she was enrolled at a convent run by Irish nuns .
She worried that history would repeat itself , but quickly made new friends among the all - white pupils .
Sandra with her mother and brother Adriaan
Still , the conversations she enjoyed most were with the school 's Zulu driver , Samuel .
' I could talk more easily to black people than white , ' she says .
' I just felt more comfortable with them . '
During the holidays , Sandra worked with her mother in the family 's general store .
She liked chatting with the customers , especially Petrus Zwane , a Swazi vegetable seller .
' Everyone liked Petrus - even my father , ' Sandra says .
She knew Petrus had a wife and three children , but by the time she turned 14 , she burned with a schoolgirl crush .
One day , in the pine forest behind the Laings ' house , Petrus kissed her .
Not long after that , they made love for the first time .
Their affair continued for several months before her parents found out .
' My mother said my father would kill me , ' says Sandra .
' He was mad .
He shouted : " White people do n't get involved with black people .
I try to get you in a good school and now you 're busy with kaffirs ! " '
Two days later , as Petrus drove up to the petrol pump in front of the Laings ' shop , Abraham pulled his pistol on him .
' Ma grabbed the gun and Petrus stood there frozen .
My mother told Petrus to go and never come back . '
The affair created an unbridgeable chasm between Abraham and his daughter .
Within a year , convinced that her father no longer loved her , Sandra eloped with Petrus .
After fleeing , both of them were arrested .
He served a month in jail ; she was held for two months .
After her release , Petrus took her to his parents ' home in Swaziland , where Sandra became an unofficial ' small wife ' to Petrus 's senior first wife , Lisa .
She settled well with her new family .
' I was happy .
I felt at home .
They were like my own people , ' she says .
Sandra kept in occasional phone contact with her mother , and when , a year later , aged 16 , she gave birth to her first child , Henry , she rang Sannie .
' She said I must bring him , but that I should come in the middle of the day so my father would n't know . '
Petrus dropped off Sandra and Henry close to the shop .
Sannie held her grandson and kissed him , but Sannie did n't invite Sandra into the house .
' The visit lasted only ten minutes .
My mother was scared my father would come . '
Within 18 months , Sandra was making the same trip with her second child - a daughter named Elsie .
' My mother said I should not make contact again '
' As I was about to leave , my mother said they were thinking of moving .
She said I must look after myself , and also that I should not make contact with her again , ' says Sandra .
' I was sad , but I knew it was my father 's idea , not hers . '
Two years later , Sandra returned to her parents ' shop to find it empty .
No one could give her a forwarding address for her parents .
In May 1977 , Sandra 's third child , a daughter called Jenny , died aged seven months of a fever .
Sandra and Petrus were devastated .
He began to drink heavily and Sandra became convinced he blamed her for Jenny 's death .
He accused her of fooling around with other men and turned violent .
At first , he slapped her .
Then he began hitting her with a sjambok , a whip traditionally made of leather thongs or rhinoceros hide .
Sandra 's back was soon covered with deep sjambok cuts ; blood ran in streams from her head .
She worried that somehow Petrus 's anger was her fault .
She feared he would kill her and decided it was time to flee .
One chilly winter afternoon in July 1979 , she ran away with David Radebe , a friend of Petrus 's , taking their two children , Henry and Elsie , with her .
The move precipitated a new , desperate phase in her life , when David abandoned her before their son , Prins , was born in March 1980 .
To support her children , Sandra took on a cleaning job , but within a year she became seriously ill .
Doctors diagnosed cancer of the womb , and because she needed surgery , she was persuaded to have her three children fostered .
However , the cancer diagnosis turned out to be wrong - she had another , less serious gynaecological condition , from which she later recovered .
By then it was too late
But by then , it was too late .
Sandra had lost Henry , Elsie and Prins to the welfare system , and although she continued to see them every other weekend , it would be nine years before she could reclaim them .
Adrift and bereft for her lost children , she fell into another relationship and had another child , Anthony .
Again , the father left her before her baby was born .
Finally , in 1987 , Sandra 's life turned a corner when a truck driver called Johannes Motlaung began courting her .
' I liked being with Johannes , ' she says .
' He was quiet , and he did n't beat me . '
She had her sixth and last child , Steve , with Johannes in 1988 .
Shortly afterwards , her three elder children were returned to her .
Her daughter , Elsie , remembers being surprised to see her mother standing at the school gate .
' She told us she was coming to fetch us for good .
I was really glad .
I cried .
She said she did n't have money , and I said : " Ma , it does n't matter , as long as we are together . " '
Once her family was all under one roof , Sandra felt strong enough to reignite the search for her own mother and father .
She traced a cousin , Susanna , who told her that her father had died of throat cancer a year earlier .
' I felt sad and shocked .
I had wanted to ask him for forgiveness before he died , ' says Sandra .
Susanna also gave Sandra her mother 's phone number .
She called , and they spoke for the first time in 16 years .
' She was surprised to hear from me .
She asked how many children I had .
I told her five .
She kept asking where I was staying and if I was OK .
' You must n't ask for any more money '
I did n't ask her where she was , but I did ask why they did n't let me know my father had died .
She said that they did n't know where to find me . '
A few weeks later , Sandra received a letter and £ 150 from her mother , but no return address .
' You must n't ask for any more money .
There is n't more ...
You must stay well and look out for yourself , ' Sannie wrote .
' Many regards from Mamma . '
With the end of apartheid in 1990 , Sandra felt her life was , at last , on an even keel , but that her lasting happiness depended on receiving forgiveness from her mother for having abandoned her .
After exhaustive inquiries , Sannie was traced to a retirement village outside Pretoria , less than an hour 's drive from Sandra 's home .
In January 2000 , Sandra stood at the entrance to a visiting room twisting a white handkerchief in her hands .
An inner door opened and a nurse appeared , pushing an old woman in a wheelchair .
Sannie sat with her eyes downcast .
' I was afraid she was still mad at me , ' says Sandra .
' But Ma looked up and I saw that she still loved me . '
It was a joyful reunion , but the aftermath was marred by the fury of Sandra 's brothers .
Sannie , then aged 80 , had suffered three strokes and Adriaan was convinced the shock of seeing Sandra could kill her .
He and Leon blamed their sister for turning her back on the family .
In an angry phone call , Leon told Sandra she had broken their parents ' hearts .
' He said that after I left home , my mother and father were never happy again .
I had chosen not to be their sister and I had to lie on the bed I had made for myself , he said .
I did n't answer him .
I just listened .'
No one told her that her mother had died
Despite their objections , Sandra returned to see Sannie several times .
The last occasion was in July 2001 , a month before her death .
No one told her that her mother had died until after the funeral , and Sandra is convinced that was because her brothers did n't want her there .
Sandra has accomplished a great deal against all odds .
Throughout her life , despite her many flawed choices , she has served her nation as a symbol of all that was irrational and inhumane about apartheid .
She has shepherded five children into adulthood , and maintains fiercely loving relationships with all of them .
In Johannes , she 's finally found a kind - hearted soul mate .
Today , the skin that caused her so much trouble as a child remains unlined and unblemished .
The best thing that happened recently was when Leon called her to see how she and her family were doing .
' It was nice , ' she says .
' We just talked like brother and sister . '
Sandra still hopes that , one day , they will meet .
' I 'll ask him to forgive me , ' she says .
She remains the one prepared to carry the blame for a family tragedy that was far beyond her control .

I 've been working on File - Find - Object for quite some time now .
File - Find - Object provides an alternative to File :: Find , which is a built - in module in the perl 5 distribution , with several major philosophical limitations .
What both modules do is traverse a directory tree and allow the programmer to do something with all the results , similar to the Unix shell 's " find " command .
My obsession with working on File - Find - Object started in this perl5 - porters thread , where I also claimed that File : : Find was probably IO - Bound , and so making it iterative and capable of instantiation ( which is partially what File - Find - Object is all about ) , will not harm its performance much .
As it turns out , I was not entirely right .
About two weeks ago , I decided to finally benchmark File - Find - Object .
The original motivation for this was a small change I did and perceived as an optimisation in which I reduced the number of hard - disk - reading system calls that it used to a minimum .
I wrote a few shell scripts that timed the old version of F - F - O versus the new one on my ~/ progs directory ( which contains many sub- directories ) , after it was in turn traversed by the shell " find " command .
Both version took somewhat over 2 minutes to complete the scan , which seemed pretty good to me .
However , when I benchmarked a similar script using File : : Find , I found out that it finished the scan in under 5 seconds , making it 24 times faster than File - Find - Object .
I did n't want F - F - O to be so much worse , so I decided to work on optimising it .
My methodology in optimising File - Find - Object was to profile it using Devel : : NYTProf ( the Perl profiler with the best reputation , and one which I can now recommend as well ) , find problematic spots , try to optimise them , and then benchmark the old code against the new to see if there were any improvements , and if so - commit .
Among the notable changes I performed were :
The first thing I noticed was that a lot of time was spent in Class : : Accessor code .
To remedy this , I switched to Class - XSAccessor , which resulted in saving 40 seconds of runtime .
The other changes I made were less substantial individually in terms of run-time saving .
Added a flag to $ self ( the object instance ) with whether or not the stack of the directories through which the traversal is in progress is full .
It was used inside several dynamically - generated functions where I delegate to top and non -top versions .
To save some extra speed , the flag is checked using exists which should be a bit faster than checking for the truth of the value .
Saved 2.5 seconds of run-time by implementing a commonly used function ( that was reported to consume a lot of time ) in a direct manner , instead of the top / non - top delegation , and using some judicious optimisation using the " || " operator .
Saved many seconds on eliminating calls to _copy methods that flat - copy array references ( and that are also generated dynamically ) .
Often , the copying was not needed at all .
Eliminated excessive calls to File :: Spec 's functions by caching the results .
For each node , File - Find - Object performs two actions in a specific order depending on the " depth " instance - wide parameter .
Previously , handling them involved weird returns of arrays , and indexes - mangling ( which I admit that I originally implemented in my endless refactoring ) .
This was changed to a simple array of method names , from which values are extracted .
Re-arranged the order of operations to prevent an if ( _is_top ( ) ) { ... } conditional , that was done in every iteration .
Originally , the main object served as the controlling object for the top directory , and dir_stack - >[ 0 ] was the directory below it .
So when checking for fatherhood of a directory , one had to return the main object for the father of dir_stack -> [ 0 ] .
In a series of commits , I moved it to be a separate object , as well as occupying the first step in the directory stack .
As a result , I was able to cache the " _current " object inside an accessor , because doing so in for the main object before would have resulted in a circular reference , which would have caused a memory leak .
Thanks to all these optimisations , File - Find - Object now runs at about 30 - 40 seconds .
Yesterday I also benchmarked the first version of File - Find - Object before I took over its maintenance , and started refactoring it , and it runs at 17 seconds for the same test .
So what are the Conclusions ?
Accessors in Perl may incur a large overhead if Class : : XSAccessor ( or similar ) are not used .
Extracting methods excessively can incur a heavy penalty on performance of Perl programs .
Traversing a directory in Perl can be very CPU - bound .
Many small optimisations can together yield a huge benefit .
Bill Raymond says in this message to the fc- solve - discuss mailing list that " I achieved my fast times by multitudes of 1 % reductions " .
I can attest to it here .
</p>
As indicated by the benchmarks , the road to a faster File - Find - Object is not over , and I still have some ideas for improvements in mind .
But it 's still much better than it used to be , and I can be proud of it .
The title of this post was inspired by Ido Trivizki's " Shavin ' another bit " presentation given at YAPC :: Israel : :2004 , and which I attended and enjoyed .
It has become an essential part of the school curriculum
Andrew Miller asks whether open source software can help schools use their budgets more efficiently
Looking around the British Education Training and Technology show , BETT 2009 , it was clear by the sheer size of the event , that an awful lot of money is being spent on technology in education .
With Open Source Software ( OSS ) freely available , covering almost every requirement in the national curriculum , a question has to be asked why schools do not back it more fully , possibly saving millions of pounds .
As the name suggests , OSS is community - driven software with its source code open to all .
Anyone can modify the software according to their needs and then share these modifications with everyone else .
When many people hear OSS they think Linux - the alternative operating system that comes in many flavours such as Ubuntu , openSUSE or Fedora .
Linux has long been used to power servers , but open source extends to all manner of projects .
Web browser Firefox and the OpenOffice software suite are great examples of this .
Open promotion
In the education sector , OSS is promoted and used by only a handful of self - motivated technologists looking to stretch their technology budget .
Critics say Becta - the government agency that oversees the procurement of all technology for schools - has not done enough to promote OSS .
Peter Hughes , head of procurement agreements at Becta , told the BBC that more would be done .
An estimated 30,000 people visited BETT this year " As an organisation , we have been criticised for not adequately covering open source solutions and our predominance of proprietary solutions , such as those by Microsoft .
" We have therefore responded to this pressure and in our role of strategy and delivery of technology in education , we 've made an effort to stay balanced and have focused on facilitating effective choice for schools , " he said .
At the end of 2008 Becta collaborated with the government 's procurement services organisation OGCbuying .solutions to approve 12 suppliers , all of which can outfit schools with open source software .
Becta considers the appointment of Sirius a " major step forward " and that it sent a message to the community that " we 're taking OSS seriously " .
John Spencer , Sirius head of business development , told the BBC that there was a deep ignorance of open source , not just in schools , and that Linux suffered an image problem .
" Many schools are frozen in time from the year 2000 , when it became obvious computer literacy was not going to be optional but then they have n't moved on .
" They do n't want to move away from what they know , not just to Linux but equally to Vista and Office 2007 as well .
Good teachers will always be looking to move forward but they are so busy that they are often conservative , " said Mr Spencer .
The growth in IT is putting greater demands on school budgets Sirius has already installed open software in many schools around the UK .
One project in a Twickenham school allows netbooks and notebooks owned by the school or a pupil to be booted up across the network to give them access to the files and programs they need .
" The network cost half that of the RM offers and the reduction in power consumption allows the system to pay for itself in under 3 years , " said Mr Spencer .
Competiton time Another Becta initiative revolves around the opensourceschools.org.uk website which launched in late 2008 .
It aims to provide basic information and best practice guidelines for teachers using OSS .
However , Becta has some reservations .
" We want teachers to realise that they can be and should be considering OSS as a viable alternative , " said Mr Hughes .
" That said , schools still need to do their homework .
There can be just as many caveats with open source as there are with proprietary solutions . "
So what do the big software firms think about open source software encroaching on their patch ?
Steve Beswick , director of education for Microsoft UK , told the BBC that while open source software may , on face value , offer savings , there could be hidden costs , both financial and otherwise .
Schools and colleges must be able to make an informed choice about the software they need
Jim Knight MP
Schools Minister
" A lot of people are trained in Microsoft - based technologies , so there may be increased costs in re-training to learn how to use open source solutions , " he said .
Mr Beswick claimed that Microsoft was not against open source , and was " committed to interoperability " illustrated , he said , by the support for the Open Document Format in Service Pack 2 of Office 2007 .
He also mentioned the work Microsoft has done getting IIS , its flagship web server software , to work with the PHP web scripting language .
The Schools Minister , Jim Knight , echoed Becta 's view .
In a statement , he said : " Schools and colleges must be able to make an informed choice about the software they need - be it open source or proprietary - and to be aware of the total cost of ownership of that software , including sustainable support and training .
" I see it as Becta 's role to work with open source and proprietary software providers to ensure that schools and colleges can make the most effective use of that software to support teaching and learning . "
So what does the open source community make of this ?
Gerry Gavigan , the chairman of the Open Source Consortium , told the BBC that a shift to open source software would require a change in thinking .
" Ongoing training costs do n't go away merely because of a change from proprietary software to free and open source software .
" What does change is liberation from the training costs associated with an externally encouraged or enforced upgrade cycle , " he said .
Another issue frequently raised is that of technology lock - in , one of the biggest arguments used by open source advocates as to why Windows is still prevalent .
Moodle has more than 24 m registered users " Something that is n't always taken into account when calculating software procurement costs , is the ongoing costs costs arising from licensing or technology lock - in , " said Mr Gavigan Mr Gavigan felt that the free nature of open source software sometimes worked against it .
" Announcing you have spent amazing sums of money trying to tackle a problem has more impact with your audience than saying you have used a free solution .
There is an unfortunate myth that if it does n't cost anything , it is n't worth anything " he said .
Web world
However , some schools are taking on OSS .
Highworth Grammar School , in Ashford , is offering both licensed and open source software to students .
The school 's network manager , Marc Blake , said that while it was important for pupils to be aware of alternatives to Windows , it was worth acknowledging that pupils live in a world dominated by Microsoft .
But , he told the BBC , significant savings could be made by using some open source alternatives .
" We offer both Office 2003 and OpenOffice , so that people have a choice .
I 'd estimate 98 % of people choose Microsoft Office over OpenOffice , but at least that choice is there , " said Mr Blake .
" For our school to upgrade to Office 2007 , it will cost around £ 27,000 as a one - off cost , but that does n't include the cost of re-training and updating all the associated worksheets and teaching material . "
Linux has proved popular with web servers across the globe " To get the equivalent of Moodle [ a free source of e-learning software ] for our 1200 students would have cost in excess of £ 3,000 per year .
You do n't get the professional support , but if you 're willing to take that on , it 's great money saving , " he added .
One of Mr Blake 's main concerns with moving to Linux was whether it would work with some of the newer web technologies .
However , although the school does have several Linux - based Asus EeePCs which are used predominantly for Web 2.0 projects .
At this years BETT , a significant proportion of educational software went Web 2.0 , in an attempt to stay cross-platform compatible .
Schools could make significant savings by using open source , but this also requires a significant investment of time , research and training .
But using a combination of both commercial and open source , such as that employed by Highworth School , can help to reduce costs while still giving students a choice .
That 's got to be good news for any school 's report card .

The hit web sitcom The Guild , which is about to launch its second season , never mentions World of Warcraft , but with its references to gnomes , raids and obsessive compulsive behaviour , it is clearly based on the game , which now claims 11 million global subscribers , or mortal slaves .
The Guild has just been picked up by Microsoft and centres on a group of World of Warcraft players meeting in the real world .
For the uninitiated , World of Warcraft ( known as WoW ) is a fantasy adventure set in the vast metaverse of Azeroth , populated by humans , gnomes , elves , magicians or orcs , ogres and zombies .
Subscribers spend an average of 17 hours a week playing it .
Media coverage of WoW has tended to focus on its impact on teens ( " Is World of Warcraft Killing Our Kids ? " ) but , according to WoWinsider.com , 85 % of its subscribers are over 18 and the average age is 30 .
The Guild is about a group of gamers for whom the virtual world has become more real than the real .
Season 1 opens with a mortal dilemma when the protagonist , Codex ( played by the series creator , Felicia Day ) , is doorstepped by her Guild - buddy Zaboo , who declares his love .
The twin feats of an indie production about a niche community being bought by Microsoft , for an undisclosed sum , and being sponsored by the mobile phone company Sprint , are testament to its success .
Day , 28 , who writes and produces the series , describes herself as " a geek girl and proud " .
Best known in the US for playing Vi in Buffy the Vampire Slayer , she started gaming when she was six .
As her dad was in the military and her family moved a lot , games such as King 's Quest and MUD provided a fixed community and playground .
Day graduated to WoW in her 20s .
In between acting jobs , she would spend around 30 hours a week on Guild missions ( " in under two - three hours you can't accomplish much " ) .
" I have a very obsessive personality , " Day admits .
" I felt I was missing out if I was n't playing , that there were things I needed to accomplish .
It reached a point where it was unhealthy .
I preferred to hang out with my guild . "
Characters in her programme were drawn from experience but " taken to a heightened level " .
The fellowship includes Clara , a ditsy mother who incarcerates her three small children in a creche while she plays , and Bladezz , an alienated , amoral teen who speaks in text acronyms .
Day believes WoW has a lot to teach us : " We crave social relationships ... and yet we do n't know who lives next door .
We do n't have community any more so we form an online community which seems tenable . "
Day 's obsessional character was key to getting the production off the ground .
The Guild was written as an hour - long TV pilot but was rejected by a number of studios .
" We were fighting against the stereotype of online gamers as pickly - faced teenagers living in their basements , " she recalls .
In the end , Day and her co-producer , Kim Evie , funded the first episodes themselves and spent eight hours a day emailing bloggers about the show and marketing it through the Buffy and WoW communities .
The next seven episodes were funded through donations collected via a PayPal button on their website and donors were credited at the end of each show .
In effect , The Guild has been a masterclass in direct marketing of content to a niche peer group .
" The web is an amazing opportunity for people who want to tell stories but are n't permitted because they are n't the mainstream , " says Day .
Season 2 , now available on MSN video , Zune and Xbox , has been shot in HD on a slightly larger budget .
A DVD will follow .
Clearly Day and her company are no longer bothered whether The Guild makes it to TV .
With Season 1 clocking 10 m hits and the marketing muscle of Microsoft behind Season 2 , who needs television ?
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Walt Disney Co’s ESPN TV network is interested in acquiring further sporting rights if it fits with its business , including for the English Premier League , a spokesman said on Wednesday .
However , the spokesman declined to comment further on its immediate plans , following a report by the Bloomberg news agency that said ESPN planned to bid for some of the live rights .
Bloomberg said the most watched U.S. sports channel was considering bids for one or two of the six packages on offer , citing a person familiar with the plans , who declined to be identified because the bidding process had not started yet .
The FA Premier League sent out invitations last month to tender for the rights for 2010 to 2013 .
“ We are interested in all rights , including the Premier League , as long as they fit our business , ” the ESPN spokesman said .
“ But we do n’t have any comment on the Premier League despite press speculation about it . ”
Pay - TV firm BSkyB currently holds the broadcast rights to two thirds of the English Premier League matches and sports broadcaster Setanta holds the remainder .
The bids are due by early February .
For a decade Russian academic Igor Panarin has been predicting that the US is going to fall apart .
He says D - Day will be in 2010 .
For years he was ignored , but now he ’s being sought out by the media and invited to Kremlin receptions .
Could America ’s time be over ?
Despite the burst of interest in his work , most learned observers find his scenario to be , well , unlikely .
But should we care ?
In fact , might not a Disunited States be better than the United States ?
Prof. Panarin obviously is a bit of a nut .
In the US , too , nutty professors often get more attention than their more serious colleagues .
The Wall Street Journal summarized his views : " Mr. Panarin posits , in brief , that mass immigration , economic decline , and moral degradation will trigger a civil war next fall and the collapse of the dollar .
Around the end of June 2010 , or early July , he says , the US will break into six pieces  with Alaska reverting to Russian control . "
Indeed , he expects foreigners to take over everything else as well : California will go to China , Hawaii to China or Japan , the plains states and Midwest to Canada , the South to Mexico , and the Atlantic seaboard to the European Union .
It makes you kind of wonder if his brain cavity is filled with fruit flies or something .
Between America and Russia , the country which most recently found itself on the losing end of mass dissolution was Russia ( which dominated the Soviet Union ) .
The nation which most recently had to use force to prevent further secession was Russia ( in Chechnya ) .
And the state most dramatically shaken by the economic crisis was Russia ( check oil prices , the stock market index , and the value of the Ruble these days ) .
The US has more than its share of economic problems and Prof.
Panarin is correct in noting that " there are no miracles " when it comes to the incoming Obama administration .
But if one of the two countries is headed towards systemic crisis , it ai n’t America .
Still , the fact that Prof. Panarin is living in an alternative universe does n’t mean that he is wrong in perceiving that the United States is not all that united .
Why are Hawaii , Alaska , Texas , Michigan , and Massachusetts , along with everything else , stuck in the same nation ?
Even if they are n’t likely to break apart , maybe they should do so .
Secession gained a bad reputation in America from the Civil War , which actually was not a civil war , since the southern states were attempting to break away , not seize control of the central government .
More important , the Southern cause was irrevocably tainted by the role of slavery , even though racism was endemic in the North , which would have preserved slavery had the conflict ended quickly .
However , the victors write the histories , which is why most accounts of the Civil War assume that the death of the Confederacy was a grand victory for America .
But it was triumph of the centralized American state headquartered in Washington , DC , not of Americans .
After all , there was no obvious reason why South Carolinians should be forced to live in political union with New Yorkers .
Rather , it should have been a matter of choice , and choices can change .
The destruction of slavery was a wonderful , unintended consequence of the war .
But that is n’t why President Abraham Lincoln called on northerners to march south and conquer their erstwhile countrymen .
Instead , Washington initiated a conflict that consumed more than 600,000 lives to force dissenters to remain in the same political compact .
Even if the pro-union faction was correct on constitutional and practical grounds , from what stemmed its moral right to pinion the South to the North with bayonets ?
The United States is a wonderfully diverse country , and its outermost points  Hawaii , Alaska , California , Maine , and Florida  are among its most interesting parts .
Yet much of today ’s so - called culture war reflects attempts by different groups to dominate national policy .
Where government is limited , individual rights are respected , and people are tolerant , a federal republic is much easier to maintain .
But as power has been centralized in Washington , and a distant and largely unaccountable bureaucracy has asserted increasing control over ever more individual decisions , it becomes harder to share a political union with so many other people .
( America ’s foreign policy of almost unremitting militarism is one outgrowth of today ’s centralization of power . )
Obviously , the US is not alone in finding national unity ever more difficult to attain .
The end of totalitarian communism left the Soviet Union without its unifying cement , which is why the multiethnic state cracked up so quickly .
Even a much reduced Russia is not free of centrifugal forces .
A freer and more prosperous China is facing some of the same forces of disunion .
India does not unite so much as bring together enormously diverse peoples , and , lacking a powerful center , suffers from routine and startling levels of violence .
Nevertheless , Prof. Panarin ’s musings could usefully trigger some serious soul - searching in the United States .
What once united Americans was a shared commitment to individual liberty and to restricting government power to ensure respect for other people ’s choices .
That commitment disappeared decades ago , however .
People still reflexively refer to the US as a " free country , " but that is only true in relative terms .
While Americans remain freer than most other peoples around the globe , they hardly are free .
Thus , today disunion might prove to be a blessing .
If the Midwest wants socialism , with government control of manufacturing , then it should be separate from the South , which holds to a stronger if not exactly pure ethos of self - reliance .
If California wants to be in the forefront of cultural relativism and experimentation , then it also should be separate from the South , which retains much of its heritage as home of the Bible Belt .
The western mountain states prefer more of a rough libertarianism in economic and cultural affairs .
New England and the mid-Atlantic states have their own cultural peculiarities and economic assumptions .
If we ca n’t just leave each other alone , then maybe we should live separately .
For better or worse , the US is n’t likely to crack up on Prof.
Panarin ’s schedule .
If Americans want disunion , they will have to choose to make that happen .
Whether that would be a good thing is hard to predict .
A simpler solution would be to return to America ’s tradition of limited government and individual liberty  and the corresponding foreign policy of nonintervention .
A national government which left its people alone would provide a far more hospitable home for the increasingly diverse people who live within our country ’s boundaries .
Otherwise , Prof. Panarin ’s predictions ultimately might just come to pass .

Looking for the perfect idea to thread into your campaign world or to kickstart your next game or RPG match ?
This article contains many helpful ideas .
Zoltan Tasi
Looking for the perfect idea to thread into your campaign world or to kickstart your next game or RPG match ?
Well , look no farther .
Even if your game is n't Steampunk , Victorian , or Edwardian in slant , you might find cool ideas here you can adapt for a different kind of adventure ( horror , cyberpunk , etc ) .
1. Evil Ingenuity
A dastardly villain has cooked up something new and dangerous using his astounding genius , the latest in envelope - pushing clockwork bits , and of course , steam technology .
What it is , from your typical house - sized clockwork deathspider or steam - powered juggernaut of a war walker to something even more fantastic and terrifying , like a clockwork Death Star orbiting Earth and holding the whole world hostage , is of course up to the DM or Referee .
Creativity is encouraged .
This dread device might even be some kind of automated food - growing factory or stock - market predicting analog calculator that could spell a whole other kind of trouble for a completely different group of people .
But regardless of what the machine is , this dastardly villain has some group of people close to the characters that he 's threatening to blow up / ruin , etc. and the characters have been asked to intervene , to stop this evil villain at all costs .
This is a great way for them to earn respect from a key group of people and also pick up a powerful , campaign - spanning nemesis in a sort of " if it was n't for those pesky kids ! " or " I 'll get you next time , Gadget ! " kind of way .
2. The Tortured Genius
The characters meet or are introduced to a brilliant inventor the likes of which they 've never seen before .
He 's a small man , very quiet and very secretive , but he needs help .
With every flash of brilliance he receives , each new idea or improvement upon existing inventions that crosses his mind , he is visited by frightening and demonic horrors - and he has the gashes to prove it !
Are these terrors real , or are the wounds self - inflicted ?
... or is it something much more ominous ?
3. Left in the Breeze
A moderately famous inventor has an idea for a world - changing device ( a tower that transmits signals across continents , a machine that generates free , wireless energy or a perpetual motion machine , etc. ) and a well - known big business mogul has agreed to finance the machine - until he realizes just how much money he 's bound to lose on it when it replaces his other " investments " .
Now he 's pulled all funding , used his influence in the richest circles to blackball the inventor , and even gone so far as to secretly hire thugs to smash up what has already been built .
( This can be played from either side - the inventor can come to the characters for help , or they can be the " hired thugs . " )
Either way , this seed could " grow " into something really fun .
4. The Crossing
The characters have to cross from one nation or state to another to get where they 're going , and going around " the long way " is n't an option .
Unfortunately the nation they 're about to cross into is at war with the nation they 're in , and it's a bitter feud .
The characters will have to be careful not to get sucked into the fighting or labeled as a sympathizer for either side ( People wonder : " Why would you want to go over there , Hmmm ? " ) and crossing will be just as difficult - the borders are closed and guarded , with battles and raids going on all the time , even at night .
5. Into the Fire
A luxury liner airship has gone missing in the uncharted territories , and one of the passengers is the daughter of a local nobleman .
The characters are offered some generous sum of money to go and retrieve her .
The only problem --
The daughter has already been found , by a hostile tribe of warrior nomads !
6. Down , Down
A mining company has set up a series of shafts at the edge of the uncharted territories hoping to dig out as much gold , silver and arcane technology as they can .
But when miners start going missing , they contact the characters and offer to pay them to track down and eliminate whatever it is that 's down there .
What lurks in the depths of that dark mine ?
That 's up to the DM .
( Ideas : disturbed undead from ancient grave site , fallout vault with survivors trying to protect themselves , some new subterranean lifeform or parasitic fungus , portal to hell , etc . )
7. Heart of Darkness
A team of explorers have set up an outpost deep in the uncharted territories and have secured a site in the name of the queen ( or king , or kaiser , etc . )
It 's a long trip by steamboat , but when the settlement stops communicating with the crown , the characters are sent in to investigate .
What they find is totally up to the DM .
( Ideas : Foreman / chief has gone insane and slaughtered his own men , locals have killed off everyone , everyone is mysteriously gone , or a malevolent spirit has devoured or chased away everyone , etc . )
8. The Item
A local collector has his eyes on some holy relic that a rancher in the uncharted territories refuses to give up ( Ideas : ancient scroll , item of great power and / or mystique , a tablet , a map , holy relic , etc. ) and he wants the characters to go and find a way to " convince " the rancher to give it up ... or " liberate " it altogether .
9. Gone With the Wind
A fiery young woman with a moving picture recorder machine wants to make a documentary about nomadic tribesmen in the uncharted territories , and she needs a party of strong lads ( or ladies ) willing to protect her and carry her equipment .
She 's very driven , and quite willing to sacrifice anyone ( but not necessarily her equipment ) to get the perfect shot -- which could be a real problem , because the nomads she 's most interested in are cannibals and head - hunters ...
10 . Just Ordinary Folk , Sir
A scientist ( or military officer ) has just invented a powerful new device / weapon and he / they need to move it right away .
Doing so by ordinary means is too risky -- they have to sneak it from point A to point B .
This is where the characters come in -- the plan is , if they dress like merchants and the item is kept hidden in a wagon , they can get it to where it 's going without the unwanted attention or risk of being set upon by a powerful rival .
Whether they actually do or not is up to the DM .
Makes a lot of great opportunities to scare your players .
11 . Last Flight
The characters are offered an easy job guarding a dignitary aboard an airship , but when they set sail , it turns out the dignitary is none other than the supremely evil , mustachioed arch rival / nemesis of the party come to seize his revenge , and when he splits , they 're left alone on the airship .
The catch ?
The controls have been smashed to bits , and the airship is headed further and further out to sea .
Add dynamite and or other " oh crap " devices to spice things up a little .

Obama Announces " Organizing for America "
Washington Post ^ | Jan. 17 , 2009 | Chris Cillizza
Posted on by FocusNexus
President - elect Barack Obama announced the formation of a new group known as " Organizing for America " that aims to continue the grassroots advocacy that the former Illinois Senator began in his presidential campaign .
" As President , I will need the help of all Americans to meet the challenges that lie ahead , " Obama said in a video message e-mailed to supporters ( and reporters ) this morning .
" That 's why I 'm asking people like you who fought for change during the campaign to continue fighting for change in your communities . "
The new group will be the flagship of " Obama 2.0 " as many people have taken to calling the transformation of the political organization created during the 2008 campaign .
The new group will work within the Democratic National Committee -- led by Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine -- to advance the Obama agenda .

Well , I held my nose and voted for McCain .
As Rush said , better to drag him over the threshold and then fight with him for the next four , than to let Obama get into power .
I think McCain is beneath contempt , but I still argued for him and voted for him .
With him in office and Palin as VP , representing the future of the party , there was some hope .
Now , we are in a very , very bad situation , with considerable risk that America may never recover from the damage .
Yes , we ’ll continue to fight .
But it will be against terrible odds .

The R&B singer revealed in a recent interview with The Associated Press that he will soon announce details of his ' One Night Stand ' tour .
He said specific dates are still being worked out for about 15 " intimate " venues .
Anzeige
Asked why he wanted to perform a " ladies only “ tour , Usher said he relishes the challenge .
" There ’s only a few artists that can pull that off , “ said the 29 - year - old singer .
" I feel like I ’ve had such a connection with my audience .
This album , I felt like , was definitely the type of one that was more intimate .
So what better way to get up close and personal than to make it all women ? “
Usher ’s latest album , ' Here I Stand ' , finds him still singing about the life of a lothario , but this time he ’s a more mature , committed lothario .
He sings : " This aint ’ sex / This is a symbol of the true makings of love . “
Last year , Usher married Tameka Foster and the couple had a son , Usher Raymond V .
Though now a family man , Usher has n’t relinquished his sex symbol status .
" The ladies like to see that masculine build , “ he said .
" They question if I still got it . “
Anzeige
To go with the theme , Usher is also planning his own line of lingerie and men ’s undergarments .
He already has a fragrance and cologne .
Usher , who ’s working on a video for his new single ' Trading Places ' , will perform at the National Football League ’s annual kickoff concert Thursday along with Keith Urban and Natasha Bedingfield .

Almost everyone that owns a computer system has a printer .
Mention the words laserjet , inkjet or even dot matrix and people will understand the reference .
The most common usage of these devices is rather dull : to print documents and photographs .
But did you know that there are many other unusual applications of printing technology in the production of solar panels , concrete walls and even something as mundane as toasting bread ?
Here are 8 printers that make your office printer look lame , even if they do use the same technology !
1. Nanoparticle Ink Printer
Nanosolar ’s original goal was to mass produce state of the art solar panels , something not really achievable using a standard high vacuum manufacturing process .
This process is slow , with a maximum 10 to 30 MW capacity per year , and its operational costs are also incredibly high .
To overcome these obstacles , Nanosolar created a highly innovative printer to replace the aging technology .
The $ 1.65 million printer is used to print the thin film solar cells using nanoparticle ink and has an amazing output of 100 feet per minute .
With a 1 GW annual capacity , the new tool is said to be twenty times faster than the traditional method and it is far more cost efficient as the high vacuum tool would have cost 10 times more per tool .
2. 3D Printer
Primarily used in prototyping , 3D printing creates a three dimensional model by layering and connecting cross sections of the material based on CAD design .
The most common printer used to create these models is an inkjet system .
The printer is filled with a fine white powder , either plaster , corn starch or resin , and bonded by an adhesive dispensed by the inkjet heads forming each cross section shape as depicted in the CAD design .
3D printers are generally used to develop prototypes in industries such as architecture , metal works , geospatial and the entertainment industry .
This technology has also been used in forensic pathology and palaeontology for the reconstruction of bones , facial features and even fossils .
3. Concrete Printer
Like seeing a naked person running down the street , most people do a double take when they hear of the concrete printer .
A concrete printer sounds ludicrous , but it is in fact a reality .
Researchers , from the USC Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies ( CRAFT ) , have taken the 3D printing technology used in constructing three - dimensional solid objects and applied it to printing concrete objects .
The contour crafting equipment outputs neatly trimmed layers of concrete , adding subsequent layers to form the object .
Liking it to inkjet printing , the overlaying process is vital to forming the shape but instead of using ink , the machine dispenses concrete .
So far CRAFT have managed to create a concrete wall using this technology , but envision that the technology will one day be used to manufacture large scale buildings and infrastructure .
4. Digital Fabrication
Using a technology similar in principle to 3D printers , digital fabrication systems , or fabbers as they are more commonly known , create solid objects based on the inputted design .
Often summarised as a small , self contained factory , fabbers are used to make not only prototypes but also the final product .
Fabbers are categorised by their functions .
Subtractive fabbers , also called computer - numerically controlled machines , build the models by carving into a solid block of raw material .
Additive fabbers are more like traditional 3D printers in that they add layers and mould the material into the correct shape .
Formative fabbers apply pressure to the raw material to form the desired shape and hybrid fabbers combine one or more of the other fabber functions .
5. Bioprinter
Perhaps the most ingenious adaptation of inkjet printer technology to date has been that of Professor Makota Nakamura who is using a 3D inkjet printer to eject many thousands of cells per second to form a 3 dimensional biological structure .
He has already used the technology , which functions in a similar manner to other 3D printers by building layer upon layer of cells , to make a tube just 1 mm in diameter with double walls similar to those found in human blood vessels .
This is only the first step towards his ultimate goal : to build a fully functional human heart using the patient ’s own cells .
It wo n’t happen any time soon though , Nakamura says it could take him 20 years before the bioprinter is ready for real world application .
The possibilities are , however , incredible .
6. Glass Printer
This revolutionary printer , developed by DIP Tech , a technological partner of Tamglass , is capable of printing directly onto glass .
After the design has been captured digitally , the glass printer will print the design onto glass using solvent - based ceramic ink dispensed by the Drop - on - Demand printing heads .
The glass is then dried traditionally using air - drying or IR - drying before being fired at the same temperature as screen printing ink which sets the design .
This printer , used for both tempered and laminated glass , is said to bring great benefits to glass manufacturers .
It can print up to four colours simultaneously , reducing production time and there is no need to store , clean or maintain screens traditionally used in glass printing .
It is so versatile that you can print any design , logo or serial number directly onto glass .
7. Waterfall Printer
It ’s surprising that the idea of a waterfall printer took so long to develop , especially when it ’s such a small step from jetting out ink to water .
The effect , it has to be said , is quite stunning .
If you ’ve got a spare wad of cash and would like to add some interest to your event or office interior , then a water printer could be what you are looking for .
8. RITI Printer
This is a really unique printer , unlike none other even seen before .
Designer Jeon Hwan
Ju created a printer that uses coffee or tea dregs instead of ink .
Simple to use , all you need to do is load a piece of paper into the RITI printer and then put the coffee or tea dregs into the special ink case on top of the printer .
To print you need to move the ink case from left to right in the slot .
Once you are finished , just extract the paper from the printer and wash out the ink case .
While it is true that it is’t the optimal printer to use in an office environment as it cannot print as fast as an inkjet , nor is the quality on a par with an inkjet printer , it is , however , incredibly eco-friendly .
Aside from that home users will definitely appreciate the reduction in printing costs associated with expensive inkjet cartridges , so it is well worth using it for draft copies of documents .
9. Toaster Printer
This printer would be the perfect gift for any technology junkie , or for the person that has everything .
Yes folks , this little device will enable you to print designs , pictures or text onto toasted bread - and it does n’t even matter if you prefer white or wholemeal bread !
It is suggested that the makers of ZUSE were inspired by the original matrix printers and adapted it to burn 12 x 12 pixel resolution images into toast by marking it line by line , just like a dot matrix printer .
While commercially this printer is not of much use , unless you run a restaurant and want to imprint your logo on toast , it is still a fun gimmick to have at home that is sure to make your family smile at the breakfast table in the morning .
Digital printer technology certainly has come a long way since the first dot matrix and laser printers and it seems to be evolving at a rapid pace .
The application for this technology is potentially limitless and is proving indispensible to both industry and home users alike .
This log entry is the first of a series that will try to build a critical but constructive review of this crucial element of future Energy Policy in Europe .
The European Commission published the Second Energy Review ( SER - 2 ) November 2008 .
Entitled “ Securing our Energy Future ” , it was made available during the same week the IEA 's World Energy Outlook was released , which stole much of the impact it could have had and delayed serious insight up to now .
An audio version of this log entry can be downloaded here .
SER - 2 is a set of ten documents of different scopes and purposes .
They are gathered at the Strategy 's web page , where a plethora of other supportive documents can also be found .
The amount of information gathered at this web page is quite considerable , making it a very useful resource , something that by itself is already a positive result of the effort put into this Strategy .
The first document to be reviewed is the press release that serves as a sort of Executive Summary to the full Strategy .
Securing your energy future : Commission presents energy security , solidarity and efficiency proposals
“ Securing your ” is an unfortunate way of starting .
The implied gap between policy makers or technocrats and commons citizens is in stark contrast to what the EU should aim to be .
In any event this is just a detail , but illustrative .
The opening paragraph contains a few key ideas and shows up front the main areas of action :
The European Commission has proposed today a wide - ranging energy package which gives a new boost to energy security in Europe , supporting the 20 - 20 - 20 climate change proposals which should be agreed by December .
The Commission puts forward a new strategy to build up energy solidarity among Member States and a new policy on energy networks to stimulate investment in more efficient , low - carbon energy networks .
The Commission proposes a new EU Energy Security and Solidarity Action Plan which sets out five areas where more action is needed to secure sustainable energy supplies .
The Commission also looks at the challenges that Europe will face between 2020 and 2050 .
In addition , a package of energy efficiency proposals aims to make energy savings in key areas , such as reinforcing energy efficiency legislation on buildings and energy - using products , and enhancing the role of energy performance certificates as well as inspection reports for heating and air - conditioning systems .
SER - 2 puts flesh on the bones set out by the 20 - 20 - 20 agenda .
But it is clear that the Strategy 's scope is going beyond Climate concerns .
“ Security and Solidarity ” sounds virtuous .
Conceptually , member states should be able to address threats to foreign energy supplies better by cooperating among each other .
Some expectation builds up on knowing exactly what this plan is .
Of positive note is also the intent to look into the long term and the focus on Efficiency , a chapter where the Commission can have a decisive and swift impact .
Quotes worth noting :
54 % of Europe 's energy is imported at a cost of €700 for every EU citizen .
We have to address this urgently , by taking measures to increase our energy efficiency and reduce our dependence on imports .
We have to invest and diversify .
The proposals adopted today represent an unequivocal statement of the Commission 's desire to guarantee secure and sustainable energy supplies , and should help us deliver on the crucial 20 - 20 - 20 climate change targets .
José Manuel Barroso , Commission President
But we have to do more , be more ambitious , and be even bolder to avoid the risk of energy disruption in the future .
This means investment .
Investing in energy , including energy efficiency , means giving our economy the push it needs at this uncertain time .
Andris Piebalgs , Energy Commissioner
The development of strong and reliable energy partnerships with suppliers , transit countries and other major energy consumers is key , and therefore the new generation energy interdependence provisions proposed today is an important step forward .
Today 's review also proposes steps to strengthen the EU 's capacity to mobilise in support of essential infrastructure to bring supplies from third countries .
Benita Ferrero - Waldner , Commissioner for External Relations
Urgency .
The role of Energy in our society and the menaces posed by internal depletion seem to be now grasped , if not fully at least in good measure .
Too bad that this Commission had n't the same thinking when it took office in 2004 , but better late than ever .
It is also worth pointing out that this Commission is not dreaming about “ energy independence ” and acknowledges healthy foreign relations as an important pillar of the Union 's energy predicament .
Implementing the measures to reach the targets set by the European Council towards the 20 - 20 - 20 agenda is the first priority of SER - 2 , with the security of supply relegated to second place .
But , the scenario is painted clearly :
Even when the renewable energy policy goals are reached , Europe is likely to be dependent on more imports than today .
The EU needs to improve the current policies to achieve its energy efficiency objective .
Moreover , the ability of the EU to respond together in a crisis needs to be strengthened .
Such sobriety is encouraging .
But it should be made more clear that a scenario where the EU imports more energy by 2020 than now is very unlikely ; the exact opposite is what should be expected – hence the concern .
One more point worth highlighting :
Greater focus on energy in the EU 's international relations , including through [ sic ] establishment of relationships with supplier , transit and consumer countries based on interdependence will contribute to the achievement of the EU energy policy goals and also increase the EU 's influence on international energy developments .
Closer coordination among Member States and with the Commission in external energy relations will be particularly important in this regard .
This acknowledges that Energy will henceforth have a pivotal role in geopolitics and that an integrated European Energy Policy will naturally require an integrated European Foreign Policy .
This is one point that still haunts the EU ( also evident when Kosovo declared independence ) and once more stresses the need for an update of European Institutions .
Finally some interesting things can be read between the lines of the closing paragraphs :
Background
The first Strategic Review led to the European Council agreement in March 2007 on energy policy targets for Europe .
Since then , the Commission has proposed a number of measures to deliver these goals , including a package of proposals to open up the EU energy market further , now close to adoption , a Strategic Energy Technology Plan to promote clean energy technology , new measures to improve the energy consumption of consumer goods and proposals for new compulsory targets on renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions .
The March 2007 European Council invited the Commission to bring forward an updated Strategic energy Review in early 2009 .
The proposals adopted today respond to that request .
From this stems the idea that the previous proposals directed at deregulating the Energy Market failed to address either Climate concerns or Energy Security , eventually leading to this second Strategy .
SER - 2 represents a re-formulation of the Energy Policy defended during the first half of this Commission 's office , that in face of events had this time to address reality .

What A Difference Two Years Makes
CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) --
It may seem obvious that men perceive women in sexy bathing suits as objects , but now there 's science to back it up .
Images of women in bikinis prompted brain responses in men associated with using tools .
New research shows that , in men , the brain areas associated with handling tools and the intention to perform actions light up when viewing images of women in bikinis .
The research was presented this week by Susan Fiske , professor of psychology at Princeton University , at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
" This is just the first study which was focused on the idea that men of a certain age view sex as a highly desirable goal , and if you present them with a provocative woman , then that will tend to prime goal - related responses , " she told CNN .
Although consistent with conventional wisdom , the way that men may depersonalize sexual images of women is not entirely something they control .
In fact , it 's a byproduct of human evolution , experts say .
The first male humans had an incentive to seek fertile women as the means of spreading their genes .
" They 're not fully conscious responses , and so people do n't know the extent to which they 're being influenced , " Fiske said .
" It 's important to recognize the effects . "
The participants , 21 heterosexual male undergraduates at Princeton , took questionnaires to determine whether they harbor " benevolent " sexism , which includes the belief that a woman 's place is in the home , or hostile sexism , a more adversarial viewpoint which includes the belief that women attempt to dominate men .
In the men who scored highest on hostile sexism , the part of the brain associated with analyzing another person 's thoughts , feelings and intentions was inactive while viewing scantily clad women , Fiske said .

Men also remember these women 's bodies better than those of fully - clothed women , Fiske said .
Each image was shown for only a fraction of a second .
This study looked specifically at men , and did not test women 's responses to similar images .
A supplementary study on both male and female undergraduates found that men tend to associate bikini - clad women with first - person action verbs such as I " push , " " handle " and " grab " instead of the third - person forms such as she " pushes , " " handles " and " grabs . "
They associated fully clothed women , on the other hand , with the third - person forms , indicating these women were perceived as in control of their own actions .
The females who took the test did not show this effect , Fiske said .
That goes along with the idea that the man looking at a woman in a bikini sees her as the object of action , Fiske said .
The findings are consistent with previous work in the field , and resonate , for example , with the abundance of female strip clubs in comparison to male strip clubs , said Dr. Charles Raison , psychiatrist and director of the Mind / Body Institute at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia .
Raison was not involved in the study .
Previous research found that people tend to similarly dehumanize those who are homeless or drug addicts , although the phenomenon in this case is somewhat different , Fiske said .
People have reactions of avoidance toward the homeless and drug addicts , and the opposite for scantily clad women .
The broader purpose of the research was to explore circumstances under which people treat one another as the means to an end , Fiske said .
Past studies have also shown that when men view images of highly sexualized women , and then interact with a woman in a separate setting , they are more likely to have sexual words on their minds , she said .
They are also more likely to remember the woman 's physical appearance , and sit closer to her -- for instance , at a job interview .
Taken together , the research suggests that viewing certain images is not appropriate in the workplace , Fiske said .
" I 'm not advocating censorship , but I do think people need to know what settings should discourage the display and possession of these kinds of things , " she said .
Both women and men have something to learn from this line of research , Raison said .
Women should be aware of how they are perceived when wearing provocative clothing , and men should n't let feelings of impersonal sexual longing interfere with their more personal relationships with other women , including female friends .
" Many men make foolish choices because of sexual attraction , " he said .
" The suggestion might be that there 's some hard - wiring there that can interfere with the average man 's ability to interact on deeper levels with really hot looking stranger women in bikinis , " he said .
Women may also depersonalize men in certain situations , but published research on the subject has not been done , experts say .
Evolutionary psychology would theorize that men view women as objects in terms of their youth and apparent fertility , while women might view men as instrumental in terms of their status and resources , Fiske said .
Another avenue to explore would be showing images of men's wives and girlfriends in bikinis , Raison said .
He predicts the objectifying effect would not happen in this context .

With three of the four major broadcast networks showing significant ratings declines since the start of the TV season in late September , they have been doling out make - goods , particularly in the month of December .
That means they are giving back ad time that they cannot sell in what as known as the scatter ad market .
Only CBS is doing well enough in prime time that it has not yet had to give out make - goods , so it has been able to sell more of its remaining ad inventory .
Image Leslie Moonves , chief executive of CBS , which is up 1 percent in viewership .
Major TV networks still draw advertisers  dollars .
Credit ... John Paul Filo/ CBS
” We have zero make - goods , ” said Leslie Moonves , president and chief executive of the CBS Corporation , of his broadcast network ’s prime - time performance .
“ Demand is not what we would like it to be .
And scatter pricing is basically flat with what the upfront pricing was . ”
Last year at this time , it was as much as 40 percent higher .
But Mr. Moonves said that not having had to give make - goods so far this season has put CBS in a better position than the other networks to sell more ad inventory now and in 2009 , if advertisers remain interested .
While they are short of available inventory to sell because of make - goods , both ABC and Fox said that heading into the first quarter of 2009 , each would be scheduling programming that would raise their ratings and enable them to sell more advertising in the scatter market .
Fox will have its annual ratings juggernaut “ American Idol , ” while ABC has five new scripted prime - time shows it will introduce from January to March .
“ We ’re maintaining our business and have not been faced with any type of major cancellations , ” said Jon Nesvig , sales president for Fox Broadcasting .
“ First - quarter upfront retention was over 95 percent , and we ’re selling scatter for first quarter at upfront pricing or slightly better .
We have not renegotiated any deals .
Everybody has many concerns going forward , but we ’re hoping for the best . ”

DALLAS  Eager to hire teachers for bilingual education programs , the Dallas public school system assigned fake Social Security numbers to newly hired foreigners so it could get them on the payroll quickly , an internal investigation found .
The district continued the practice for years , the investigation found , even after it was admonished by a state agency .
It was only halted this summer .
“ The inappropriate procedure of assigning false SSNs has been systemic , ” investigators with the school district ’s Office of Professional Responsibility wrote in a report on the matter dated Sept. 25 .
The Dallas Morning News ran an article on Friday after obtaining the report , marked “ highly confidential , ” through a records request .
Here is a side by side of the video posted and a photo from 2005 .
Please allow me to explain .
The video in question made its initial appearance on LiveLeak with the upload date January 1st .
It claims to be connected to IDF strike in the recent conflict with the header " RAW ( Graphic ) : Scene After IDF Attack In Gaza 1/1/09 " .
This turned out to be a very inaccurate and misleading claim .
Someone , likely a pro-Israel right - winger ( judging his attitude rebutting criticism of Israel 's response to Hamas / Gaza reminiscent of Little Green Footballs fan who sought to " minimize " the horror as reflected in reddit comment history ) , posted a detailed comment on Reddit that debunked the claim .
Here is what the debunker by the reddit username TW9zc2 Fk ( who has been a registered user for only a week ) said :
___________________
THIS VIDEO IS MISLEADING
The video was not taken on January 1st 2009 .
It was not taken in a civilian market , and it was not the result of an IDF air strike .
This video is from September 23rd 2005 , and was taken in the Jabalya refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip .
A Hamas pick - up truck carrying Qassam rockets detonated by mistake during a Hamas rally , leaving at least 15 killed and dozens more injured .
The pick - up truck in question is visible for a split - second at the start of the video .
The section of the video showing the pick - up exploding has been edited out .
The large number of Hamas personnel present , the number of injured in military uniform , the large number of civilians and Hamas flags all over the place confirm this .
Compare the video from 4:08 - 4:24 with this photograph taken after the blast at the rally .
In the background of the video the man shown in the white top in this photo is clearly visible tending to one of the casualties .
Another person is shown coming over to him and placing the distinctive purple / green striped blanket over the body laying next to him , and the wooden pole he is knelt next to is visible .
The man in the white top is visible once again in this photograph ( from this CBS News article ) along with the man in a yellow shirt with serious leg injuries visible at around 3:55 in the video
A side - by - side comparison of a frame from the video at ~4:08 and the aforementioned photo from the CBS News article is here .
News articles about the actual incident depicted in this video :
Palestinians killed in Gaza blast -
At least 15 Palestinians have been killed and scores injured in a blast during a parade by the militant Hamas group in the Gaza Strip .
A truck carrying gunmen and home - made weapons blew up during the rally in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza .
Israel has denied involvement , while the ruling Palestinian Fatah faction said it held Hamas responsible . [...]
An unnamed witness was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying " I was thrown several metres , then I looked behind and I saw people dismembered and lying on the ground dead . " [...]
� BBC News Gaza : Blast during Hamas rally kills
19 - At least 19 Palestinians were killed and some 80 more were injured Friday from an explosion that occurred during a Hamas rally at the Jabalya refugee camp in north Gaza .
While the Palestinian Interior Ministry has reported that 19 people died in the blast , hospitals said that at least 10 people were killed .
Some of those killed were Hamas members , and the rest were citizens , among them two children , who took part in the rally .
The Palestinian Interior ad National Security Ministry said that according to eyewitness accounts the blast occurred inside a vehicle carrying Qassam rockets and was not the result of IDF fire .
A videotape of the rally showed a jeep blowing up , followed by images of people running for safety .

Because I am interested in nothing but the whole truth , after I examined his claim with proofs provided , I was forced to concede the video is misleading and had to apologize for the mistake in unintentional deception of the public .
The video is very real but the header and description that claims IDF strike that maimed and killed the victims is , regretfully , totally misleading that have nothing to do with the current conflict .
The correct header to reflect accuracy should be " September 23 2005 HAMAS Rally Explosion Aftermath " .
The video , upon closer examination , was deliberately edited to maximize propaganda by deception ( split second footage of Hamas soldier on truck at the very start then cut to carnage , not providing the true context ) .
I should not have jumped to the conclusion .
I was bamboozled .
Let everyone you know who has seen the video of the error .
Driver who killed son of American Mafia Godfather ' was shot and then dissolved in barrel of acid '
American Godfather : John Gotti ( pictured at his 1990 trial ) is said to have ordered a hit on John Favara after he knocked down and killed the mobster 's son
An intriguing mystery from the gangland career of John Gotti has apparently been solved almost 30 years on .
According to papers filed this week in Brooklyn federal court , John Favara - a neighbour of Gotti's who disappeared after accidentally running over and killing the mobster 's 12 - year - old son - was shot dead on the orders of the outraged Gambino crime family chief and his body was dissolved in a barrel of acid .
Authorities said a witness identified Charles Carneglia , a 62 - year - old former hitman , as the perpetrator in the 1980 killing .
The court documents said Carneglia told an informant that acid was ' the best method to use to avoid detection ' .
Those details , in a 44 - page document by federal prosecutors for a racketeering trial , offered a new twist on the fate of Favara , a 51 - year - old furniture warehouse worker who lived near the Gottis in the Howard Beach district of Queens .
He vanished without trace five months after the accident .
In the weeks before his disappearance , he was sent excrement in the post and received death threats , including an invitation to his own funeral .
Just two days after the death of Gotti's son , the local police station received a call from a woman who said : ' The driver of the car that killed Frank Gotti will be eliminated . '
Gotti , who rose through Mafia ranks to become head of the Gambino crime family , was convicted on 13 charges in 1992 , which included racketeering , murder , conspiracy and tax fraud .
He died in prison in 2002 , aged 61 , after developing neck and head cancer .
Carneglia has pleaded not guilty at the trial , which continues .
Dianne Feinstein Irked With Barack Obama ’s Choice to Head the CIA
President - elect Obama - the agent of change - has tabbed another Clinton insider , Leon Panetta , a man with basically no intelligence experience , as the next director of the CIA .
This appointment is already drawing fire from both sides of the aisle as it appears that the president - elect has made another cabinet blunder so closely following the embarrassment of the resignation of Bill Richardson as Obama ’s commerce secretary .
Even pprominent Democrat Dianne Feinstein , who will be heading the Senate Intelligence Committee , is not pleased and may actually oppose the nomination .
I was not informed about the selection of Leon Panetta to be the CIA director , ” Feinstein said .
“ My position has consistently been that I believe the agency is best served by having an intelligence professional in charge at this time
The incoming chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee is n’t the only Democrat to question Obama ’s choice of an unqualified candidate to become head of the CIA .
Rockefeller “ thinks very highly of Panetta , ” the aide said .
“ But he ’s puzzled by the selection .
He has concerns because he has always believed that the director of CIA needs to be someone with significant operational intelligence experience , and someone outside the political realm
President - elect Obama has had a tough stretch lately between Rahm Emanuel ’s involvement in the Blagojevich scandal , to Obama lying about Emanuel ’s involvement , to Bill Richardson resigning in disgrace from Obama ’s cabinet , to Obama ’s lack of courage in at least making a statement on the Israel / Hamas conflict .
And now he has tabbed an unqualified Clinton insider to head the CIA , drawing the ire of the woman who will head the Senate Intelligence Committee .
With all of the Clinton insiders who have been named to the agent of change ’s cabinet one has to wonder if indeed a deal was struck between Obama and Clinton to stop Hillary from forcing the roll call vote at the convention in an attempt to steal the nomination .
It ’s either that or he just has bad judgement and considering he ran on what he claimed was his good judgement he certainly is n’t showing us much in that category , is he ?
Police in Jersey have revealed that no murders were committed at a former children 's care home at the centre of a massive abuse inquiry .
Following revelations that previously released evidence on the case was inaccurate , Chief Officer of Jersey Police Graham Power has been suspended pending an investigation .
Police also expressed ' much regret ' at misleading information released by Mr Power 's predecessor , Lenny Harper .
The claims were made during an investigation into claims of abuse during the 1960s and 1970s at the Haut de la Garenne children 's home on Jersey .
So far three people have been charged and are awaiting trial on the island .
The abuse investigation was launched in 2006 but scandal surrounding the home , which was a youth hostel in recent years , only received widespread media attention in February .
At a news conference this afternoon , detectives revealed that information about finds at the home - which indicated that children might have been killed and then buried - were inaccurate .
No Murders
In their first briefing since taking charge of one of Britain 's biggest child abuse cases , Deputy Chief Officer David Warcup and Detective Superintendent Michael Gradwell discredited a string of previous police claims .
* A bone fragment , said to be from a child 's skull , was in fact a coconut .
* The shackles and restraints were found to be rusty pieces of metal , with no indication that they were used for restraint .
* It was revealed that there was no blood on a ' blood - stained bath ' found in a cellar .
The bath had not been used since the 1920s .
* There was nothing suspicious about bones and teeth found in a cellar at the home .
The bones were animal bones , dating from between 1470 and 1670 .
The teeth were children 's milk teeth .
* There is no suggestion of murder or of any bodies destroyed .
* Reports that police had uncovered secret underground chambers or punishment rooms were wrong .
* Many ' secret chambers ' were just holes in the ground .
Despite admitting ' incorrect ' information was given out by police in the past , Mr Warcup insisted there was no indication of a cover - up under Mr Harper , who retired in August .
Mr Harper , who is now living in Ayrshire , Scotland , defended himself for raising fears children were murdered .
Mr Harper told the BBC it was unfortunate that the statements would detract from the fact that serious abuse had taken place at the home .
This March , high school juniors taking the SAT will have the option of choosing which scores to send to colleges while hiding those they do not want admissions officials to see .
The new policy is called Score Choice , and the College Board hopes it will reduce student stress around the SAT and college admissions .
But when it comes to college admissions , few things are ever simple .
Some highly selective colleges have already said that they will not go along with Score Choice , and the policy is stirring heated debate among high school counselors and college admissions officials .
Some argue that it is really a marketing tool , intended to encourage students to take the test more often .
Others say that , contrary to the College Board ’s goal , the policy will aggravate the testing frenzy and add yet another layer of stress and complexity to applying to college .
Two years ago I was working on a script when the producers hit my writing partner and I with an unexpected question : “ Do you think this movie could be shot in Romania ? ”
The movie took place at a summer camp so we thought , “ not successfully . ”
Romania kinda resembles woodsy America , but considering that it was kept at third world status under the Soviet boot for nearly 50 years , we doubted they had a lot of posh summer camps to choose from .
But being shameless whores we simply suggested changing the movie itself .
What did Romania have plenty of ?
Castles !
Summer camp ?
Pft. Boring .
The change made no sense for the story , but who cared ?
We wanted to see a castle .
In the end I got to spend a month and a half in Transylvania and Bucharest .
Yes , friends , you too could win a free trip with screenwriting !
It ’s a straightforward system , but there are two invaluable rules you should know : 1 . Make Your Destination Indispensable .
Huge budget movies like Indiana Jones 4 shoot on location to show off .
If you ’re working on that kind of flick , you do n’t need free vacations .
Most movies that leave LA do so for tax exemptions offered by places like Vancouver , but that ’s hardly a decision for the writer to make .
No , you need to make the production leave the confines of LA .
The reason we sold - out our summer camp for a castle was because we ’d previously written a script about a cruise ship , and briefly the movie was to be shot on an actual cruise ( out at sea ) until the producers discovered the cheaper , landlocked Queen Mary down in Long Beach .
They were n’t gonna find any castles in Long Beach , if you follow me .
2 . Make Yourself Indispensable .
Say you ’ve successfully achieved your location - shoot project .
Well , paying to fly and keep a human on location is pricey , especially on union shoots .
The script is already done ; you ’re an unnecessary budget drain .
Even on money - to - burn studio flicks , WGA guidelines make it cheaper to replace you with an on - set ghostwriter .
Since I ’d been left in LA before , when the Romania thing came along I had a plan .
I wrote myself a character to play in the movie .
It ’s got to be the shoes !
Ever since Michael Jordan arrived in the NBA and Nike launched its first pair of Air Jordans , the shoe scene has never been the same .
Expensive sneakers became the norm , collectors began to exist , and kids were even stealing each other ’s shoes .
Now I ’ll grant you that ranking shoes is often a generation dependent concept and the criteria is entirely subjective , but we at Gunaxin wish to present to you the Top 10 Basketball sneakers of all time .
And if you ’re really into shoes , I ’d suggest checking out the Sole Collector for more info .
10 . Reebok Pump
The Reebok Pump was very popular popular in the early 1990s , featuring an internal inflation mechanism that regulated a unique fitting cushion in the upper tongue .
Users could literally “ pump it up ” .
Released in 1989 as basketball high - top , the success of the pump led to models for football , tennis , and track .
The Human Highlight Reel Dominique Wilkins wore the Reebok Pump original from 1989 on , and Dee Brown made them memorable in the 1991 All Star weekend dunk competition .
Here ’s a sample ad :
9. Nike Air Foamposite One
Foamposite
One was the first shoe model to use Foamposite technology , a synthetic foam that molds to one ’s foot giving the wearer a truly custom fit .
The shoe also featured synthetic leather and a clear gum sole .
Worn by Anfernee “ Penny ” Hardaway back in 1997 , Nike reworked the original Foamposite One into the Nike Foamposite Lite worn by 2009 NBA Slam Dunk Champion Nate Robinson .
They also released retro versions of the original .
8. Puma Clyde
Released in 1973 the “ Clyde ” was a custom version of the popular Puma Suede , tailor made for basketball legend Walt “ Clyde ” Frazier .
Frazier asked for a wider - fitting version of their suede basketball shoe and Puma ended up signing him to an endorsement deal , becoming the one of the first NBA players to have his own signature shoe model .
Because Frazier encapsulated the very essence of being cool ( he would arrive at games in a Rolls Royce , dressed in designer suits , broad - brimmed Borsalino hats , and full - length mink coats ) , the shoe caught on in all walks of life .
Traditionally seen in suede , Puma recently released a few models which appear in all leather .
7. Nike Air Jordan III
You could fill an entire top ten with versions of the Air Jordans .
Some like the Vs , others the IVs , others the Space Jam XIs , the VIIIs , the newer XXIIIs , or even the XIVs .
Here we ’re going with the Air Jordan IIIs .
Released during the 1987 - 88 season , they debuted in the season when Jordan would receive his first MVP award and win the Slam Dunk contest .
It was also the first Air Jordan to feature the Jumpman logotype instead of the Wings - logo that was on the I ’s and II ’s .
And it gets a bonus for launching the Spike Lee personality Mars Blackmon and the ad campaign that followed :
6. Adidas Superstar
The Superstar has been manufactured since 1969 , and was the first low - top basketball shoe to feature an all - leather upper with the now famous rubber shelltoe .
The shoe caught the attention of some of the best players from the NCAA and NBA , most notably Kareem Abdul Jabbar .
Within the first few years of its introduction , it was being worn by over 75 % of all NBA players , proof of its revolutionary technology which remains relevant today .
The shoe became so popular , rap trio Run-D.M.C. became noted for wearing the Adidas shoe , even releasing the song “ My adidas ” in 1986 .
5. Nike Air Penny II
How do you not love a shoe that helped bring us the creation that is Lil ’
Penny , the the half - pint , trash - talking sidekick of Penny Hardaway ?
Even though Hardaway faded away fairly quickly , his shoe line lives on as Nike recently brought back the Air Penny II with a re-release .
You know , in case you missed them the first time around .
Originally released back when Penny Hardaway was tearing up the NBA , his second signature sneaker gathered mass attention when he wore them in the 1997 NBA All - Star Game .
They featured an Orlando Magic color scheme , “ Air ” technology in the heel and forefoot , “ Penny ” logo on the side panel , and the always recognizable carbon fiber shank at midfoot for added arch support .
The shoes might even get you a date with you a date with Tyra Banks .
Although in 2009 , that ’s not as alluring as it was a decade ago .
and I ’ll toss in on more Lil’ Penny ad just for fun …
4. Nike Air Force 1
Released in 1982 , the Air Force 1 featured a then revolutionary technological innovation , a pocket of air in the heel for cushioning and support .
Players like Moses Malone and Michael Cooper endorsed them , and twenty seven years later Rasheed Wallace still wears the shoe .
Dubbed the # 1 seller in the history of athletic footwear , it has been available in a wide range of color combinations , although white - on - white is the most popular model .
3. Converse Chuck Taylor All - Stars
A true classic .
The Chuck Taylor All - Stars , or simply “ Chuck ’s ” have been around in some form since 1917 .
They were not particularly popular , however , until basketball player Chuck Taylor adopted them as his preferred shoe .
That led to the shoe ’s current name and signature ankle patch .
Although classic black is the most popular , they come in a variety of colors and print styles , which has led to their popularity in many subcultures beyond the intended basketball audience .
2. Converse Weapon®
Back in the day everybody who was anybody was hocking the Weapon , including Larry Bird and Magic Johnson .
Just look at the commercial featured below .
And remember , this was in the days before every rookie got a shoe contract .
The brand was so popular , Converse recently brought back the classic sneaker .
The Bird Shoe .
The Magic Shoe .
Choose your Weapon !
1. Nike Air Jordan I
Jordan started the shoe era and made it what it is today .
For that reason it gets to be number one on this ranking .
I ’ll grant you that later versions of the Air Jordans were more popular , but there ’s always something going for the original .
This shoe was so revolutionary that it was outlawed by the NBA .
Released during Jordan ’s rookie season , the typical shoe was white with very little color .
The league deemed the Air Jordans “ too colorful ” and banned them , leading to the infamous Banned commercials :
In 2007 I set out on a three - month solo trip through Europe , in 2011 I re-located to Copenhagen .

The flyer sent to The Electronic Intifada .
In addition to bombs and missiles that have killed an ever increasing number of Palestinian civilians , Israel has dropped millions of flyers on the occupied , besieged Gaza Strip .
One such flyer , an image of which was sent to The Electronic Intifada , seeks to recruit Palestinian collaborators .
Signed by the “ Israel Defense Forces command , ” and addressed to the “ the residents of the Gaza Strip , ” the flyer states : “ You hold the responsibility for your own fate ! ”
It invites Palestinians to call or email the Israeli army “ to inform us about the location of rocket launching sites and the terrorist gangs that made you hostages of their actions . ”
Because collaboration with an occupier is universally viewed as one of the worst forms of betrayal , the flyer warns “ For your own safety , please maintain secrecy when you call us . ”
EI decided to call the number provided .
What follows is a translation of the Arabic conversation between an EI editor and an Israeli officer who identifed himself using the Arabic name “ Abu Ibrahim . ”
Israel has used cash , but has sometimes attempted to blackmail desperately sick Palestinians by witholding access to medical care unless they collaborate .
Israel may also hope that the humanitarian catastrophe it has deliberately created in the Gaza Strip will make Palestinians more vulnerable to this kind of exploitation .

EI : Hello
Israeli officer : Hello
EI : How are you ?
Israeli officer : Praise be to God , who am I talking to ?
EI : You are speaking to Ahmad .
Israeli officer : Welcome Ahmad .
EI : How are you , what is your name ?
Israeli officer : I ’m Abu Ibrahim , sir .
Where are you from Ahmad ?
EI : I ’m from Gaza
Israeli officer :
Where in Gaza , my brother ?
EI : We ’ll talk about that in a minute , but I saw one of the flyers you dropped on Gaza .
Israeli officer :
Oh yes that ’s right …
EI : I have some information for you on members of terrorist groups that are in Gaza .
Israeli officer : Oh I hope so …
EI : We ’re on the same side against terrorism … I have names for you too , if that will help you at all .
Israeli officer :
Of course that will be helpful .
EI : You do n’t know what the terrorists are doing here in Gaza and we want to be saved from them …
Israeli officer :
Yes , I think everyone should do exactly what you ’re doing because we ’re all fed up with them .
All they do to us is bad things .
EI : Exactly , the people in Gaza feels the same but the world ca n’t hear our voice .
Israeli officer :
Oh they will hear sir .
You know they ’ve [ people of Gaza ] started to phone us and ask for help , and ask us what they should do , and we ’ve helped a lot of them .
They thanked us for that and we want to help more people .
EI : But you know the terrorist groups are all over the Strip .
I mean there ’s no place in the Strip where there are n’t terrorists .
They ’re all over the place .
Israeli officer :
You just wait .
We ’ll get to them , you ’ll see .
EI : But as you know , it ’s not easy for one to talk from Gaza , to give you information , it ’s not an easy thing .
Israeli officer : Look , firstly it ’s not easy , second thing , we ’ve got other ways to reach you , very good ways not on this line and in the end your assistance to us will end up helping you too .
Every person who does n’t have to be hurt in Gaza helps us and helps you .
We benefit and you benefit .
We want to destroy this Hamas leadership who are hiding , afraid for their lives .
They are hiding and others are being killed because of them .
What are we fighting eachother for ?
Over nothing !
EI : Ok , let ’s talk … let me give you some of the information and then we ’ll talk some more .
Do you have a pen ?
Israeli officer : Yes .
I have a pen and I ’m writing .
EI I want to give you names of the biggest terrorist organizations , not just in Gaza , but in all Palestine .
Israeli officer :
Ok , let ’s see
EI : Ok , the first one …
Israeli officer :
You mean to tell me they ’re all from Hamas ?
EI : All of them are people … you ’ll see .
The first one , his name is Ehud Barak [ Israeli minister of defense ] .
Israeli officer : Ehud Barak ?
By God there ’s no one like you …
EI : Second , Gabi Ashkenazi [ Israeli army chief of staff ]
Israeli officer :
Do you know him ?
EI : Of course .
The third one is …
Israeli officer :
Wait a minute , one at a time …
EI : No write it down , I do n’t have time .
The third one is called Ehud Olmert [ Israeli prime minister ] .
Israeli officer : Look , just a minute …
EI : You think that terrorists are only men ?
There are also women .
Terrorist organizations have women too .
The fourth is Tzipi Livni [ Israeli foreign minister ] .
Israeli officer : First , I see that you ’re very clever and very experienced and you should …
EI : And then the fifth ’s name is Yuval Diskin [ head of Israel ’s “ Shin Bet ” death squads ] .
Write it down and record it my beloved .
These are the names of the biggest terrorist leaders in the whole of Palestine and in the whole of the Middle East .
Israeli officer :
You know what I think ?
I think you ’re not from the Strip .
EI : Aaaah .
You think I ’m not from the strip ?
But you take information on terrorists from any place right ?
Israeli officer : Now you ’re not benefiting at all .
You ’re not helping yourself and you ’re not helping anyone else .
If you were really from the Strip …
EI : Did n’t I just tell you that there were a number of terrorists in the strip ?
Record it .
There ’s a group of terrorists .
They ’re the biggest terrorists in the world .
They call themselves the “ Israeli Defense Force ” but they ’re not defending anyone .
They ’re a terrorist gang .
Israeli officer :
You know …
EI : A terrorist , sectarian , racist gang .
Israeli officer : I just want to say a few words to you …
EI : OK , talk , but I ca n’t hear you very clearly because of the noise of the terrorists bombs and rockets …
Israeli officer : Ah , terrorist bombs and rockets ?
I understand what you ’re getting at …
EI : Let me ask you something , dear Abu Ibrahim …
Israeli officer :
Is there anything else , or is it just you who wants to talk ?
EI : OK go ahead …
Israeli officer :
Oh it ’s my turn ?
Oh thanks there ’s no one like you .
Look sir , even if you were n’t from the Strip , the thing is you ’re still an Arab .
EI : Are you an Arab Abu Ibrahim ?
Israeli officer : Me ?
No I ’m not an Arab .
I ’m a Jew but I was born here .
EI : So what ’s your name ?
Israeli officer : I ’m Abu Ibrahim .
EI : So you do n’t want to give me your name ?
Israeli officer :
And you , you too do n’t want to …
EI : As far as the Israelis are concerned all Arabs are called Ahmad or Muhammad so what ’s the difference ?
Israeli officer :
So you want to know my full name , if I asked you your full name … let me say a few words to you .
Look , I ’m a Jew and I ’m from the Israeli Defense Forces .
But unlike you , my great , great , great grandfathers were all born here , going back thousands of years .
We never left the country .
You Palestinians have never been a nation .
The Palestinians settled here recently , only a short time ago .
What ’s that got to do with me ?
EI : Ok , the person who wants to help the people of Gaza talks like that about the Palestinians ?
You deny their existence ?
Israeli officer : Look , I ’ll tell you …
EI : You really want to help the Palestinians and this is what you say ?
Israeli officer :
Of course … I am also helping the Arabs who live with us to get into Israel , you also … Do n’t mind me saying , but I ’m sure now , from your accent , that you are not from the Strip .
You ’re not from Gaza .
But that ’s OK .
I ’m prepared to talk to you .
EI : You know why I ’m happy to talk to you ?
Because every minute I waste your time , you … I like to waste your time because you ’re a member of the terrorist IDF .
Israeli officer : That ’s OK .
You ’re not wasting my time .
I ’m happy to talk to people like you .
Why ?
Because you ’re in the wrong but you do n’t know you ’re in the wrong .
So if I talk to you it ’s possible you ’ll start to understand your mistake .
EI : I do n’t want to waste any more of your time .
Let me say something to you .
Israeli officer : By God you ’re a person I enjoy talking to .
EI : OK , your army that was defeated in Lebanon is also going to lose in Gaza .
Israeli officer :
That ’s possible .
If that ’s what you know , maybe you know what you ’re talking about .
EI : OK , farewell my beloved Abu Ibrahim .
Israeli officer : Maybe we ’ll see each other under better circumstances .
EI : Yes , I hope it will be at the International Court in The Hague .
Israeli officer :
That ’s alright .
EI : Yes , go and find some collaborators somewhere else .
You wo n’t find any here .
Israeli officer :
And in this you ’re also mistaken but that ’s OK …

US President Barack Obama 's inauguration was billed as the biggest new media event in history and the millions of netizens around the world did not disappoint , with internet and mobile networks brought to their knees by people accessing and uploading videos , photos , tweets and text .
Obama 's election campaign galvanised a generation of politically engaged young voters who are used to not only consuming news from traditional sources but adding their own thoughts and coverage via social media sites including YouTube , Flickr , Twitter , Facebook and MySpace .
Many used video sites such as Stickam and Ustream.tv to broadcast their thoughts live from the parade route and inauguration parties .
Comment
If any Microsoft product group is a candidate for getting the chop during the next 18 months , surely - surely - it 's the one leading the disastrous Zune .
Either the technology people building it , those in marketing promoting it , or the channel group responsible for working with retailers to put the thing in the hands of consumers .
In a season - the Christmas shopping period - when consumer gadgets are supposed to fly off retailers ' shelves , Microsoft 's Zune experienced a stunning $ 100 m drop in revenue , a 54 per cent plunge .
Even Microsoft was surprised .
But once again , Microsoft has insisted it 's not going to kill the Zune and remains wedded to the pocket - sized albatross around its neck .
Microsoft 's director of Zune marketing Adam Sohn has reportedly promised the " next generation " in Zune hardware and software this year .
" Planning is fast and furious , " he said .
Sohn blamed three things for the collapse in sales : the economy , a " shrinking " product category , and the fact that unlike last holiday season , Microsoft did n't bring out any new devices to entice shoppers .
In late 2007 , Microsoft had just released the 30 GB Zunes .
To be fair to the Zune , the Christmas retail season was particularly tough .
Yes , the economy sagged .
And Apple 's iPod revenues dipped 16 per cent .
But Cuperino sold three per cent more iPods than the previous year .
If this is a shrinking product category , why is Microsoft so invested and planning more Zunes ?
Microsoft will try to explain this in terms of planned " Zune services , " no doubt .
The fact is that any problems the Zune had were unique to the Zune and were only exacerbated by this brutal holiday season .
The Zune fell more than twice as much as the iPod .
If you want to understand how badly the Zune is doing , go into a high - street electronics goods retailer .
If you can find a Zune , it 'll invariably be hidden away at the back as an afterthought or lost in some other display .
Are retailers responding to a lack of consumer demand for the Zune or are retailers failing to drive demand by pushing the product ?
It can only be the former , as retailers are generally quick to spot a high - street trend they can capitalize on .
If it 's the latter , then Microsoft 's Zune team is not applying the lessons of the early Windows and PC years , when Microsoft built a product people wanted and then worked with channel partners to keep promoting it , with money for retailers and other offers .
Sohn promised more - more tweaking and more finessing .
But less is more in the case of the Zune , especially for a company that 's supposed to be cutting costs , not throwing good money after bad . ®
Besides contributing at @ TheDailyWTF , I write DevDisasters for Visual Studio Magazine , and involved in various side projects including child rearing and marriage .
For those who do n't know , there is a standard C header called setjmp.h that defines two methods : longjmp ( ) and setjmp ( ) .
The longjmp works just like a goto statement in C in that , when executed , the program jumps to another pre-defined point in the code , defined by a setjmp .
However , where goto is limited to the current , local scope , longjmp can span outside of the current scope and across functions .
If goto is considered harmful , then longjmp ( ) should definitely be considered dangerous .
As in , thermo - freakin - nuclear bomb dangerous .
Fortunately , its complexity and frequency of use seem to be on par with that of a nuke , and most C developers have not brought it in their everyday .
Most .
And then there are the folks like Giovanni Verza 's predecessor , who left behind functions like this .
/* this subroutine is called thousands of times .
use longjmp instead of loops to increase speed .
Daren
12/03/05 */
void
calculate ( struct salesinfo * sales ) {
jmp_buf buffer ;
int i = setjmp ( buffer ) ;
if ( ! ( i < sales -> count ) )
RETURN_NOTHING ;
addvaluetosubtotal ( sales -> values [ i ] ) ;
if ( i < sales -> count ) {
longjmp ( buffer , i + 1 ) ;
}
}
Now , while I can maybe see a case for the occasional use of goto to get out of a loop and skip a lot of code in a hurry , I 'd readily avise against its use in everyday programming because of the headaches it can cause .
But longjmp ?
I think I 'll be avoiding it like the plague .
C'mon people , seriously , C is a low level language .
If you want to call logic in another function why not , oh I do n't know , just CALL THE BLASTED FUNCTION ?
Taking the Longjmp Challenge
After reading through the code , I got to wondering , could this performance hack actually ... work ?
For you , dear reader , I have assembled two ( semi - ) scientific tests to help find the answer .
Links below to source and binaries for the curious and pedantic alike :
Test 1 - Use Longjmp
Test 2 - No Longjmp ( Only Loops )
On the Bowytz Megaframe ( a.k.a. my home PC running Vista ) , I created two versions - one where only longjmp functions are used for looping and the other where only loops are used for ...er... looping and ran each using Dev - C++ with nothing special added out of the box .
Each program did the same thing - sum the values of 15,000 integers , stored in an array , 5,000 times .
The result ?
When I ran the longjmp version , it took about 4 seconds to finish the summations , but when I ran the looping version , results were near instantaneous .
Sure , 4 seconds is n't exactly a glacial age , but let 's assume that a larger array is being processed by the " calculate " function several thousand times a day in a bogged - down Production environment during peak business hours ... those 4 seconds over thousands of exeutions add up mighty quick .
Since performance boosts are often sprinkled in code as liberally as cheese on pizza , call me crazy , but I have a feeling that Giovanni will be busy making some performance enhancements himself .
The men belonged to a group set up to fight HIV and Aids
The jailing in Senegal of nine gay men for eight years over " indecent conduct and unnatural acts " has been condemned by an international gay rights group .
Homosexual acts are illegal in Senegal but the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission ( IGLHRC ) told the BBC it was " shocked by the ruling " .
The judge added three years to a five - year sentence , saying the men were also members of a criminal group .
Most of them belonged to an association set up to fight HIV and Aids .
" This is the first time that the Senegalese legal system has handed down such a harsh sentence against gays , " said Issa Diop , one of the men 's four defence lawyers .
The extremity of this sentence [ and ] the rapidness of the trial all really shocks us in a country which has been moving so positively towards rule of law
IGLHRC 's Cary Alan Johnson Mr Diop said he would be appealing against the sentences .
The IGLHRC's Cary Alan Johnson said he was " deeply disturbed " by the case .
" There have been pretty consistent human rights violations in Senegal , " he told the BBC's Network Africa programme from Cape Town in South Africa .
" But the extremity of this sentence [ and ] the rapidness of the trial all really shocks us in a country which has been moving so positively towards rule of law and a progressive human rights regime . "
' Schizophrenic '
The head of a gay rights organisation in Senegal told AFP news agency that the situation for gay people in the country was getting worse .
" Many gays are already fleeing to neighbouring countries because of our living conditions , " he said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Senegal is a predominantly Muslim country and gay men and women remain socially marginalised .
Mr Alan Johnson said Senegal was " schizophrenic " in its attitudes .
Religious attacks on gay and lesbian people were on the increase , he said .
While Senegal recently played host to a major conference on Aids and sexually transmitted diseases , where " the needs of men who have sex with men were prominently featured " , he said .
" There 's both a movement towards progressive and inclusive culture but at the same time very , very strong movements towards oppression , specifically towards sexuality , " he added .
In February 2008 , a magazine editor received death threats after publishing pictures claiming to depict a wedding ceremony between two men .
Several men were also arrested in connection with the publication but later released .

When Ariane Sherine 's brilliant initiative for an " atheist bus " campaign was in its planning stages , I wrote to her to say that I was not happy about the word " probably " in the slogan " There is probably no God " .
I would question the rationality of anyone who thought that there is probably no Father Christmas , or probably no fairies at the bottom of the garden , etcetera , and since such beliefs and beliefs in the gods of Olympus and Ararat and all other religions are on a par , there is no " probably " about it .
To which Sherine replied that the advertisement would not be accepted by the bus companies unless it contained the word " probably " .
According to Tim Bleakley , marketing director of CBS Outdoor , which handles advertising for the bus networks , " advertising guidelines " require the word " probably " ; to say that there is no God , he said , " would be misleading … So as not to fall foul of the code , you have to acknowledge that there is a grey area " .
It would be misleading , eh ?
Thus the metaphysical authority of advertisers .
You have to take your hat off to this one .
If one wished to cite a better example of insidiousness , pusillanimity , timidity and absurdity , you would be hard pressed .
There is something delicious about the thought of a functionary in an advertising agency doing ontology by arbitrating on the question of which fictional characters need a grey area of uncertainty around discussion of their existence – Little Red Riding Hood ?
Rumpelstiltskin ?
Santa ?
Betty Boop ?
Saint Veronica ( who allegedly started out as sweat on a cloth and became a person ) ?
Aphrodite ?
Wotan ?
Batman ?
And of course the inevitable has immediately happened .
Theos , the religious " think " tank , clutching at straws , claims that the word " probably " might encourage some to take the slogan to mean the opposite of what it is intended to mean .
Such is the way with theology .
But give a nanometer to the ever - hopeful faithful – hope being a virtue after all – and they will take ten thousand miles , bringing with them on the journey all the things for which religion is so notable , from fantasy through folly to febrility and fanaticism .
Well : let us for a moment take the advertising standards code seriously .
Parity requires that in all the many advertisements promoting religious belief on the buses and underground trains , " allegedly " be inserted into claims and statements that imply the existence of supernatural agencies .
Now that the gauntlet has been thrown down on " probably " for the atheist buses , let us demand that " allegedly " appear in all advertisements promoting the opposite view .
I shall be writing to Tim Bleakley ( CBS Outdoor , Camden Wharf , 28 Jamestown Road , London NW1 7BY ) and the Advertising Standards Authority on the subject today , and invite you all to do likewise .

Between the ages of 21 - 30 a woman is like America or Japan .
Completely discovered , very well developed and open to trade
especially with countries with cash or cars .
Between the ages of 30 - 35 , she is like India or Spain .
Very hot ,
relaxed and convinced of its own beauty .
Between the ages of 35 - 40 a woman is like France or Argentina .
She may have been half destroyed during the war but can still be
a warm and desirable place to visit .
Between the ages of 40 - 50 she is like Yugoslavia or Iraq .
She lost
the war and is haunted by past mistakes .
Massive reconstruction
is now necessary .
Between the ages of 50 - 60 she is like Russia or Canada .
Very wide ,
quiet and the borders are practically unpatrolled but the frigid climate
keeps people away .
Between the ages of 60 - 70 a woman is like England or Mongolia .
With a glorious and all conquering past but alas no future
( a bit like Tony Blair , maybe Blair 's a woman really ) .
After 70 , they become Albania or Afghanistan .
Everyone knows
where it is , but no one wants to go there .
The Geography of a Man
------------------------
Between the ages of 15 - 70 a man is like Zimbabwe -
ruled by a dick .
LOL even countries can be associated with age now .
An extreme bike rack .
Who needs to chain to chain a bike up when you can just balance it through a piercing ?
Guarantees it will never be stolen .
This is a tale of two economists , Larry Summers and Hans - Hermann Hoppe .
They have much in common , in addition to their adherence to the dismal science .
Each is quite prominent in his field .
Summers was Treasury Secretary in the Clinton Administration , and is now President of Harvard .
Hoppe is a professor of economics at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas and a preeminent leader not only of the Austrian School of Economics , but also of the libertarian school of political philosophy .
Both are associated with the right wing of the economics profession ; although this is far more true of Hoppe than Summers , neither can properly be considered as a socialist or " progressive . "
I have heard tell that in any given room that Summers finds himself , he is much the brightest person in the group .
From my own experience , this also applies , in spades , to Hoppe .
They are even not too far apart in age , Hoppe at 55 and Summers at 50 .
But the most important thing they have in common is that each has been in the news of late for uttering views incompatible with the Thought Control mania that has swept academia like a virus .
Summers speculated about possible explanations for the scientific glass ceiling : for the failure of females to be anything like equally represented with males in the highest reaches of mathematics , physics , chemistry , and other hard sciences .
He opined that this might have something to do with the fact that women have a lower variance of these sorts of abilities than men , and that this might not be unrelated to genetics .
Hoppe ’s violation of thought control was the view that homosexuals , along with others who tend not to have children , have a higher than average time preference .
They are willing to trade more future income for present gratification than others , such as parents .
Neither of these claims is at all unexceptionable — within economics .
Both would be widely agreed to within this profession .
Certainly , neither would raise any untoward number of eyebrows within this discipline .
It would be readily understandable , moreover , that each of these economists could have stated the other view .
It is easy to imagine , for example , that Hoppe would have weighed in on male - female intellectual differences , and that Summers could have speculated about interest rate determinants ; e.g. , different time preferences for different categories of people .
Nothing much of substance would change if this " switch " were made .
The most dramatic similarity in the experiences of these two economists is of course the reaction accorded their remarks from academia .
In Hoppe ’s case , the administration pounced on him , making all sorts of threats .
They would ( and did for a time ) dock his pay , place in his file a note forbidding him from offering " opinions " in class as opposed to " facts , " summoning him to all sorts of kangaroo school court hearings , where his views on interest rates , time preferences , etc. , were judged by people completely innocent of the complexities of economics .
Although Hoppe has tenure , and thus cannot be fired except under very special and limited circumstances , his job was still put at risk by administrators anxious to punish him for his " transgressions . "
The UNLV Affirmative Action / Equal Employment Opportunity Officer recommended that Hoppe receive a reprimand and be suspended without pay for one week .
A grievance committee recommended that Hoppe be reprimanded and forfeit merit pay for the current academic year .
On February 9 , 2005 , Hoppe received " a non-disciplinary letter of instruction " from Raymond W. Alden , III , the university ’s Executive Vice President and Provost , affirming the decision of the grievance committee , stating that Hoppe had created " a hostile learning environment " in his classroom , and instructing Hoppe " to cease mischaracterizing opinion as objective fact in the educational environment . "
Summers , too , was hounded .
By the press , by outraged feminists , by his arts and sciences faculty which gave him a vote of " no confidence " ( interestingly , but not unexpectedly , this was the only faculty at Harvard to do so ) .
Summers was raked over the coals by the nation ’s editorial writers , sob sisters , and assorted " progressives . "
Both these men suffered the loss of vast amounts of precious time , when they could and would have been involved in far more productive pursuits , in the efforts to defend themselves against these respective onslaughts .
It is here that their paths diverge .
Each took a very different stance in response to the venom they had innocently unleashed .
Summers apologized , groveled , debased himself , apologized some more , and then groveled again .
He did n’t really mean it .
He was misquoted .
He will now set up all sorts of programs to hire and promote female scientists .
( Why , pray tell , when they are likely to be less distinguished than their male peers , according to his own theory ?
This would drag down the level of instruction and research at Harvard , surely something that no president of that institution should look upon with equanimity . )
Hoppe , in sharp contrast , and to his immense credit , stood his ground .
He gave up not an inch of intellectual territory .
He insisted that what he said was correct , and that even , per impossible , if it were not , UNLV ’s explicitly stated cannons of academic freedom should protect him from the sort of witch hunt to which he has been subjected .
He demanded that UNLV cease and desist from committing fraud , by violating their own rules of academic freedom .
He was adamant that the administration offer assurances that they had read and still support this document , so that what had happened to him would not be suffered by any of his colleagues in future .
He called for an apology .
He asked that appropriate punishment be meted out to the high level administrators responsible for this outrage .
He requested a year ’s paid sabbatical leave , to make up for his all but wasted academic year .
He threatened to sue .
As a result of this courageous stance , as of this present writing , the administration has caved in on several fronts .
The letter of condemnation has been removed from his file .
He is no longer threatened with job loss nor by being docked pay raises to which he would otherwise have been entitled .
His other demands are still unresolved .
Summers should have borrowed a leaf from the Hoppe playbook .
He should have stuck to his guns ( sorry , sorry , I do n’t want to get in trouble ; maybe I should not have mentioned that word ) .
He should have suggested to that female MIT professor who had to leave the room where he made his remarks because she was " sick to her stomach " that a world class university is a place where one can think and express thoughts — even those outside the box of popular opinion — and that if she finds this so repugnant that perhaps she should seek work in another environment .
Maybe she could become a baby sitter .
He should have pledged that as president of Harvard he would seek to hire , tenure and promote only the most highly competent professors , regardless of age , race , gender , whatever .
He should have told the professors who voted " no confidence " in him for the above that they should seek jobs at inferior universities , like Princeton , which recently hired Harvard castoff Cornell West , who left Cambridge , MA after Summers heroically got on his case for eschewing serious academic work in favor of rap " music . "
He should have called Hoppe , and maybe through osmosis would have been given an injection of backbone .
If Summers had done these things , he would have made a good start at cleaning out these academic Augean Stables .
As it happens , he has sent out the word , loud and clear , that Harvard places thought control above free thought , and eschews the attempt to maximize the quality of research and teaching .
He ought to be fired for betraying what once was one of the most sacred principles of higher education .
A tale of two economists .
Both started out in their respective ordeals along very similar paths .
But one showed courage , grit and determination , the other cowardice .
A lesson for all of us .

The Cellphone Gun concept by Nokia is one of the many designs that are lethal enough to make the patent office reject it right away .
However , that is exactly what makes the design so cool and smart .
The gun packs in a Nokia cellphone and you may wonder where the holy cool gadget might come to use .
Well , there are could be many instances in which you would need a cellphone , and a gun .
Take for instance a chance encounter with a cold blooded psychopath who would n’t have anything less than a knife up your spinal cord .
You could either call up 911 immediately or if the situation gets worse , you could immediately fire away and make the adorable psychopath bleed , in the legs mind you .
The Cellphone Gun might come to use if you decide to bid goodbye to everyone around you after deciding the existential angst is too much to handle .
Well , I am not exactly impressed with the idea of the product being launched commercially but it sure will help law enforcement officials and the military and reduce their baggage .
If you share my opinion about the negative effects of a cellphone that doubles up as a phone , you could perhaps check out some of the Futuristic Cellphone Designs .
Otherwise , you could wait till the Cellphone Jammer Key is launched so that you can block your teenaged kid from using the cellphone while on the wheels .
All these designs make me wonder if human imagination and creativity is a blessing or a sign of our own built - in mechanisms for our eventual extinction .

If life looks cheery in spite of the gloomy weather , mass job insecurity and the suspicion that spending hours on Facebook is mangling your mind , you might want to thank your brightside gene .
It seems that for some of us , seeing the glass as half full is hardwired into our genetic make - up , helping us shrug off the miseries of life and enjoy the positives .
Research by British psychologists suggests that people who carry the gene pay less attention to negative things going on around them and focus instead on the happier aspects of life .
By doing so , they end up being more sociable and are generally in better shape psychologically .
Elaine Fox , head of psychology at Essex University , said the gene seems to underlie some people 's ability to deal with daily stresses .
Those without it are likely to have a gloomier outlook on life , and suffer more from mental health problems such as depression .
" We 've shown for the first time that a genetic variation is linked with a tendency to look on the bright side of life , " she said .
" This is a key mechanism underlying resilience to general life stress . "
In a study involving more than 100 volunteers , Fox 's team checked how long it took people to react to good and bad images that flashed up on a computer screen .
Among the positive pictures were a couple hugging and someone sailing along in a boat .
The negative images included a photo of someone being mugged .
Chris Ashwin , a co-author on the study and cognitive psychologist at Bath University , said the test reveals whether people are inclined to focus more on the good things in life or the bad .
Genetic tests on the participants showed that a tendency to ignore negative images and dwell on the positive ones was strongly linked to a variation in a gene that controls serotonin , the brain 's main feelgood chemical .
Each of us inherits two versions of the gene , either two short ones , two long ones , or one of each .
People who had two longs versions were most likely to focus on the positives , according to the study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
How the gene works is unclear , but Ashwin suspects it might dampen down activity in part of the brain called the amygdala , which plays a leading role in regulating our emotions .
People with two short versions of the gene show more activity in that part of the brain and are more likely to be neurotic and anxious about their lives , the researchers said .
The discovery raises the prospect of employers screening out applicants who take a glum view on life .
But individuals vary too much for such a test to be effective , the researchers told the Guardian .
Of course they 're probably wrong , but who cares , working for a living is rubbish anyway .
People reported night sweats , crying they could not control , the return of anxiety and suicidal tendencies that erupted after successful years on medication .
What brought this on ?
Most were convinced the timing was related to being switched from a medicine they had been taking for years to a new agent .
These stories , which were pouring into People ’s Pharmacy , were more than web - site hosts Joe and Terry Graedon could bear .
In an effort to learn what they could about the two drugs , Budeprion XL 300 , a generic new to the market , versus Wellbutrin 300 XL , coming off patent yet still more expensive , they contacted the FDA .
When that yielded no results , they asked ConsumerLab.com to do a dissolution test .
The results ,
Six months later , and armed with its own complaints about “ adverse events ” – also known as side effects , or bad things which should n’t happen -- the FDA conducted tests to determine if the drugs were indeed identical .
Review of Therapeutic Equivalence : Generic Bupropion XL 300mg and Wellbutrin 300 XL was issued in April .
But it did not say what some consumers or watchdogs wanted to hear .
Based on the results of its standard testing , the agency concluded that " there was no significant difference in the rate and extent of absorption . "
The drugs met criteria for equivalence .
And after discounting any importance to the documented differences in the speed of release times , the agency attributed the renewed symptoms to the normal expression of depression .
Skeptics disagree .
People ’s Pharmacy and ConsumerLab.com argue the FDA ’s report is inadequate .
They point to agency ’s actual review of a 150 mg. drug and not the 300 mg .
in the title , the dose which brought the complaints .
When asked if there was a reason the FDA did n’t use the strength for which there were complaints , a spokesperson said the higher dose was associated with dangerous side effects , notably seizures .
Dale Conner , Director of the Division of Bioequivalence I , explained that the agency is allowed to substitute a lesser strength , something which happens in testing strong cancer drugs , for example , rather than subject healthy volunteers to an undesirable risk .
Symptoms of an illness or surge in drug ?
At the heart of this controversial report ruling on an antidepressant is the question of what caused the symptoms ?
And what does it have to do with the most important recorded difference , the release time of the ingredients in the different drugs .
Wellbutrin released more slowly over the extended period than did Budeprion in both tests .
Graedon and Cooperman point to the surge in ingredients in Budeprion XL 300 as the likely cause of side effects , certainly the ones they were hearing about .
“ [ H ] eadache , tremor , nausea , irritability and insomnia .
These are classic complaints of excessive levels of bupropion , the active ingredient , ” Graedon said .
Conner explains the FDA ’s understanding differently .
Because the ingredients are identical , the symptoms emerged because the effect was less than it should have been .
Hence , the FDA contends that the drug “ was not working well enough ” to treat depression .
And , for patients , this meant that “ parts of their disease came back . ”
According to the official report :
These rates of recurrence of depression in treated patients offer a fully satisfactory explanation for why some patients experience worsening of their depression following a switch to a generic product , just as some patients would have experienced recurrence without any such switch .
Conner says this is to be expected .
There are often reports about side effects or lack of efficacy with the release of a new generic .
“ There is a certain psychological component to believing this product ca n’t be as good . ”
Conner added , “ it looks different , it ’s cheaper . ”
That does not persuade Graedon .
“ People have learned their bodies , ” he said .
And complaints came from people who had been symptom - free for many years , at least until the drug they were using was changed .
Once they were returned to Wellbutrin 300 XL , their symptoms abated .
The explanation he finds most convincing is that the drug ’s speed led to symptoms .
Which drug works ?
At the heart of this issue is which drug should people take ?
Clearly generics are a staple in today ’s medicine chest , and are likely to grow proportionally as more drugs come off patent .
Too , they ’re affordable , making them an attractive choice .
And , for most people , they seem to be working just fine .
But , in addition to unwanted symptoms , what are the consequences when they do n’t ?
The policy implications can be substantial .
A recent Supreme Court decision gives immunity to medical device makers after the FDA has given its stamp of approval .
Soon , the Court will decide Wyeth v. Levine , a product liability case having to do with labeling , which could have far reaching consequences for everybody taking any medicine from aspirin to zyprexa .
These rulings are particularly noteworthy at this moment when the agency ’s flaws – insufficient monitoring of off - shore production , weak post - market follow - up , an undifferentiated system for collecting " voluntary complaints , " and an outdated infrastructure -- are being exposed in government reports and congressional hearings .
These are not directly linked to generics but clearly could easily affect them .
They are a reminder that this is an agency in serious need of an overhaul to restore accountability and with it , the trust of American consumers .
It is useful to observe , what a recent op - ed in USA Today noted , “ When the Food and Drug Administration approves a new drug as safe and effective , that is n't always the end of the story . ”
One could go further : in some cases it is the beginning .

The world 's largest car hire firm last night called on the Israeli airline EL AL to withdraw an internet advert which offered free Hertz rental to British passengers who flew to to Israel to show their " solidarity " with the country , The Independent has learnt .
The adverts , running on EL AL 's website , stated : " Now , more than ever is the time to come to Israel .
Come express your solidarity with Israel .
Fly with EL AL and receive 3 or 4 day car rental for free ! "
The advert had a clearly visible Hertz logo and when users clicked on it they could view the terms and conditions which stated that the deal with Hertz Israel was valid for EL AL tickets to the country .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But last night the Hertz Corporation said they did not want to be associated with the offer and said they had called on EL AL to remove it .
They have already insisted that their logo be taken off the promotion .
The deal was launched on 8 January , five days after Israel began its ground offensive in Gaza .
" We have already had numerous bookings as a result from the promotion , " said Anat Freidman , a spokeswoman for EL AL .
" We think that the adverts will appeal to anyone wanting to come to Israel . "
But the promotion sparked anger in the British Muslim community .
" We 're appalled by EL AL 's advert , " said Asghar Bukhari of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee , one of Britain 's leading Muslim civil rights groups .
" It 's really shocking that this type of promotion can run when innocent Palestinian civilians are being killed on a daily basis .
Muslims around the world are already taking a stand and boycotting companies who are actively supporting Israeli companies .
" If a company like Hertz would pull out of this deal with EL AL it would speak volumes , and mean so much to so many people .
We would applaud such a decision . "
A Hertz Corporation spokeswoman said it had not been aware of the promotion being run by EL AL and their Israeli franchise operator who trades under the Hertz brand .
He added that the offer was designed , run and managed by EL AL .
" We regret if any individuals were offended by the language that EL AL used to promote this offer , " said Hertz 's spokesperson .
" The Hertz Corporation , through its franchisees , has an active presence throughout the the Middle East and has partnership agreements with several Middle Eastern airlines .
Hertz has no political affiliations whatsoever and provides a car rental service to its customers wherever it is required . "
" We are in touch with EL AL and have asked them to consider withdrawing the reference to ' solidarity ' .
However we are not in control of their website . "
The Hertz Corporation is the largest car rental company in the world , and has operations in more than 140 countries .
It was founded in Chicago in 1918 by Walter L Jacobs who sold it five years later to Slovakian born John D Hertz , who renamed the company .
In 2005 Ford sold Hertz to a private equity group consisting of Clayton Dubilier & Rice , The Carlyle Group and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity in a $ 5.6 bn deal .
Several companies who do business with Israel are facing boycotts .
" Emails are being circulated alerting people about which companies to boycott , " said Inayat Bunglawala , from the British Muslim organisation ENGAGE .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Sony BMG , which is changing its name to Sony Music Entertainment , was sued on Wednesday by the U.S. government , which accused the music company of violating federal rules aimed at protecting the online privacy of children .
The music company improperly accepted registrations on its music websites from users who were under 13 , without obtaining consent from their parents , according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan .
The civil suit , which seeks unspecified monetary penalties , said Sony Music was in violation of the Children ’s Online Privacy Protection Rule , which is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission .
The case was brought by the U.S. Attorney ’s Office in Manhattan .
A Sony BMG executive told Reuters that the litigation is in the process of being resolved , with the company agreeing to pay a fine of $ 1 million , to put in place a screening process that complies with the FTC rules and hire a Web compliance officer to monitor the issue .
The executive declined to be identified , saying the news of the settlement was to be officially announced by the government as early as Thursday .
The lawsuit said Sony Music ’s notice of its information practices on its website did not clearly or accurately disclose how it collected and used the information .
Sony Corp , the Japanese consumer electronics company , agreed in August to buy full ownership of the Sony BMG music group , saying it would purchase Bertelsmann AG ’s 50 percent stake in their joint venture for around $ 900 million .
The new music company , the second biggest after Vivendi SA unit Universal , is being renamed Sony Music Entertainment and is a wholly owned unit of Sony Corp of America , Sony has said .
The rational rules of management do n't apply when it comes to fostering creative types .
Or so says Stanford business professor Robert I. Sutton .
His take on proper management techniques for the creative employee : " The practices go beyond counterintuitive ; they seem down - right weird . "
In this Harvard Business Review excerpt , the author explains why you should , among other things , encourage creative workers to defy superiors and fight among themselves .
by Robert I. Sutton
Every company wants innovation , but few have developed methods for managing the process .
That 's because the normal rules for rational management do n't apply , suggests author Sutton .
In this excerpt on " managing for creative sparks , " he describes the seemingly contradictory rules for getting creative people to be creative .
Once you 've got your talent in the door , the next order of business is to do something with it .
Again , my ideas will seem strange to people who believe that the best ways for managing routine tasks are equally well suited to innovative work , but they are supported by theory and practice .
If it 's creativity you want , you should encourage people to ignore and defy superiors and peers and while you 're at it , get them to fight among themselves .
You should reassign people who have settled into productive grooves in their jobs .
And you should start rewarding failure , not just success ; reserve punishment only for inaction .
People who do what they think is rightrather than what they are told or what they anticipate their superiors want can drive their bosses crazy and get their companies in deep trouble .
But they also force companies to try ideas that some boss or powerful group may have rejected as a waste of time or money .
3 M 's former CEO William McKnight , for example , once ordered a young employee named Richard Drew to abandon a project he was working on , insisting it would never work .
Drew disregarded the order and went on to invent masking tape , one of 3 M 's breakthrough products .
Drew 's perseverance also laid the foundation for 3 M 's defining product , Scotch tape .
Similarly , in The HP Way , David Packard brags about an employee who defied a direct order from him .
" Some years ago , " he writes , " at an HP laboratory in Colorado Springs devoted to oscilloscope technology , one of our bright , energetic engineers , Chuck House , was advised to abandon a display monitor he was developing .
Instead he embarked on a vacation to California stopping along the way to show potential customers a prototype . "
House was convinced he was on to something , so he persisted with the project , even persuading his R&D manager to rush the monitor into production .
The resulting $ 35 million in revenue proved he was right .
Packard continues : " Some years later , at a gathering of HP engineers , I presented Chuck with a medal for ' extraordinary contempt and defiance beyond the normal call of engineering duty . ' "
If it 's creativity you want , you should encourage people to ignore and defy superiors and , while you 're at it get them to fight among themselves .
 Robert I. Sutton
I 've never seen an organization with guidelines such as , " Ignore your boss if you think he or she is wrong . "
If you work in a place that actually enforces a rule like this , please contact me immediately .
I have , however , found companies where managers provide vague encouragement for employees to work on what they want and do n't demand to know the details .
This " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy is made explicit at 3 M , where technical people are expected to allocate up to 15 % of their time to projects of their own choosing .
The same attitude and similar practices are seen at Corning 's Sullivan Park R&D lab , which churns out hundreds of kinds of experimental glass each year .
Scientists there are required to spend 10 % of their time on " Friday afternoon experiments " to develop " slightly crazy ideas . "
This policy not only allows scientists to work on pet projects that bosses do n't know about but also frees them to work on pet projects that superiors have discontinued .
For instance , an entire genomics - technology business is being built on an idea that was officially killed by the head of research but was pursued in Friday afternoon experiments .
Keep the seed in the ground
In fact , creative work must be sheltered from the cold light of day , especially when ideas are incomplete and untested .
William Coyne , former vice president of R&D at 3 M , remarked in a speech at Motorola University , " After you plant a seed in the ground , you do n't dig it up every week to see how it is doing . "
In an age of customer centricity , this may border on the heretical .
But if you want to develop new products and services , I urge you to keep your creative people away from your biggest customers and for that matter from critics and anyone whose primary concern is money .
Doing so helps creativity blossom .
Psychological research shows that people are especially hesitant to try new things in front of " evaluative others " like critics and bosses .
The virtues of doing innovative work in isolation are well documented .
Tracy Kidder 's Pulitzer Prizewinning book ,
The Soul of a New Machine , describes an engineering team that was sequestered in the basement offices of Data General .
Kidder shows how the resulting lack of attention helped the " MicroKids " on this " Eagle Team " do a better and faster job of designing a minicomputer .
Kiyoshi Kawashima , former president of Honda , used a similar approach in 1978 .
He was concerned that Honda was losing its vitality because senior managers could n't understand what kinds of cars young people wanted .
Kawashima assembled the youngest members of his staff ( average age 27 ) to design a car that would appeal to younger customers and promised that senior managers would not interfere with the team 's operation .
The result was the hot - selling Honda City Car .
Few companies , it seems , are able to innovate without shielding teams from the mainstream .
At the same time , a company should n't let a team get too cozy .
One of my most well supported ideas for managing creativity is that you should find some happy people and then get them to fight .
Mind you , I 'm not talking about provoking personality conflicts or relationship issues ; battles between people who despise one another squelch innovation .
The fights you need to cause are all about ideas .
Bob Taylor , a psychologist turned research administrator , first encouraged this kind of conflict among the computer scientists from various universities he funded while at the U.S. Department of Defense 's Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) in the 1960s and later at Xerox PARC in the 1970s .
These scientists and engineers , perhaps more than any others , are responsible for the technologies that made the computer revolution possible , including the personal computer , the Internet , and the laser printer .
The computer scientists Taylor funded through DARPA met at an annual series of research conferences , as retold by Michael Hiltzik :
" The daily discussions unfolded in a pattern that remained peculiar to Taylor 's management style throughout his career .
Each participant got an hour or so to describe his work .
Then he would be thrown to the mercy of the assembled court like a flank steak to a pack of ravenous wolves .
" I got them to argue with each other , " Taylor recalled with unashamed glee .
" These were people who cared about their work .
If there were technical weak spots , they would almost always surface under these conditions .
It was very , very healthy . "
Reward failure
Enhancing innovation also has to do with how performance is rewarded .
This , too , entails a dramatic departure from the management practices ingrained in most companies .
Rather than rewarding success and punishing failure , companies should reward both .
Again , I must distinguish between what is right for routine work and what is right for creative work .
When known procedures are used by well - trained people , failure does signal improper training , weak motivation , or poor leadership .
But applying this standard to innovative work stifles intelligent risks .
Every bit of solid theory and evidence demonstrates that it is impossible to generate a few good ideas without also generating a lot of bad ideas .
Former Time Warner chairman Steve Ross had a philosophy that people who did n't make enough mistakes should be fired .
That 's an anomaly , though .
Few companies tolerate failure , let alone reward it .
If you want a creative organization , inaction is the worst kind of failure and the only kind that deserves to be punished .
Researcher Dean Keith Simonton provides strong evidence from multiple studies that creativity results from action .
Renowned geniuses like Picasso , da Vinci , and physicist Richard Feynman did n't succeed at a higher rate than their peers .
They simply produced more , which meant that they had far more successes and failures than their unheralded colleagues .
In every occupation Simonton studied , from composers , artists , and poets to inventors and scientists , the story is the same : Creativity is a function of the quantity of work produced .
These findings mean that measuring whether people are doing something or nothing is one of the ways to assess the performance of people who do creative work .
Companies should demote , transfer , and even fire those who spend day after day talking about and planning what they are going to do but never do anything .

One of the founders of the plain English and simplification of contracts movement , Alan Siegel argued today that the Internet uproar over Facebook ’s decision to change their terms of service will impact future online and offline contracts .
I think it will definitely change online contracts , but I doubt it will change traditional paper contracts .
Mr. Siegel said , “ At a time when there is a call for transparency and honesty in all sectors of society and business — online and offline — clearly Facebook showed an initial lack of sensitivity to the interests of their 175 million users when they changed the terms of the privacy provisions in their terms and conditions contract .
While they put a note on the company blog that said the company ‘ simplified and clarified a lot of information that applies to you , ’ users were not asked to agree to the new terms or even alerted by e-mail about this rather significant change .
Facebook merely added this line to their terms : ‘ Your continued use of the Facebook Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms .
This generated such a strong negative reaction from Facebook users that Facebook announced they were reinstituting the terms of the original agreement . ”
Siegel concludes that Facebook ’s about face will lead other companies to change the way that they communicate with their users / customers , “ This about - face clearly demonstrates the power of the Internet that will force companies to communicate with clarity in their contracts with their customers .
Companies will no longer be able to hide behind impenetrable contracts that provide unfair protections or conditions .
It looks like the Internet and its legion of bloggers will be the stimulus for an upheaval in legal communications that is long overdue .
This Facebook uproar will transform online — and offline — contracts .
The days of consumers blindly signing whatever is placed before them are clearly over . ”

I think that Mr. Siegel is overly optimistic .
The Facebook case was unique because of the number of users that Facebook has and the change to their TOS that amounted to them taking over ownership of what you post on your account , but even at its peak this was n’t some sort of wide sweeping revolution .
The Facebook group against the change only has 130,000 members which is less than one tenth of one percent of their users .
What I view this outcome as is a victory for the power of the Internet community .
Maybe only 1 percent users were vocal about the change , but they did a fantastic job spreading the word .
Why Facebook changed their minds was that this became a mainstream media story .
When networks like CNN picked up the story , Facebook had to back down or face a public backlash , and a PR black eye , personally I use Facebook , but I send links to friend , or the occasional message , but I do n’t post anything that I consider of value there .
The Facebook saga should be a lesson to all social media sites that what the users give , they can also take away .
I think there needs to be a new law about how and in what manner sites can notify their members of changes to the TOS .
Honest companies will send an email explaining the change .
However , more dubious under the radar practices are too common .
Companies post a note in their blog as Facebook did , or send a vague late night email .
Users should have the right to be notified in a clear and timely manner about TOS changes .
In the end , bad TOS changes will catch up to any social media site , because there will always be a group of users that are paying attention , and there are plenty of other options for consumers .

Thanks Brad , RawStory , Dr. Nass with her Anthrax vaccine blog for continuing to cover this important issue .
9/11 Truth , which includes the Anthrax letters , still holds the key to understanding the current imperialism abroad and fascism at home .
There are many theories out there , but one grounding fact should never be forgotten : Government Officials lied about the air being safe to breathe when they knew it was full of poisons after the Towers came down , thereby causing more injury and death to Americans than the planes themselves .

Tell them to go and chop up some stills or push some paper or something .

NewConstituionalConvention ( #1 ) :
" ... Government Officials lied about the air being safe to breathe when they knew it was full of poisons after the Towers came down ... "
Amen !
You just gave me ChrisMatthews - esque ' tingles down my legs ' .
That is exactly the line of argument I use when debating the unthinkable with my less - than - thoughtful , mostly mal - informed colleagues and family members .
You 're right -- that should be a fundamental jumping off point for undoing the warped logic behind the public 's blind acceptance of the official Government story .
In the months after the attacks , I worked very closely with the NYC municipal unions on site - specifically the United Brotherhood of Carpenters .
In mid October , 2001 , I learned they did their own ongoing , independent ( and much more thorough ) testing of the air quality in Lower Manhattan .
They did their own assessment / analysis for the men and women they were sending to the site and how it would impact their long term health .
What they told me forever altered my root assumptions ... changed me .
I was told by high ranking Union members that the EPA testing was " intentionally " inept and incomplete / samples were n't placed in key hot - spots , were n't left out long enough to gauge accurate readings , failed to produce the evidence the Carpenter 's had on record of extremely harmful , toxic , levels of PCB's / Freon acid pools / Fiberglass , and God knows what else ...
If they would lie to us about the air we were breathing --- not only without proper respirators available , but without even being told that we NEEDED them ... then what the Hell else were they lying to us about ?
I remember supporting Howard Dean with a fervor in 2003 because he was one of the only candidates who expressed outrage about those lies from the EPA , propagated and pushed from the White House , and vowed to get to the bottom of it / hold someone accountable .
At the time it did n't occur to me not to believe him .
Now 2009 , and no one has ever been held to task for lying to , and jeopardizing the health of hundreds of thousands of brave Americans , who set an example for the world on Thursday Sept. 13 by just getting on the subway , and going back to work .
Gracious thanks , NCC , for that important reminder .

And they learned after their mistake of blaming Hatfill who is still living .
This time their patsy was sent to a mental institution , released and then dies of what they are calling a suicide .
Most likely Ivins was injected with something while in their custody or in some other way " suicided " .
Nobody that smart is going to commit suicide with something he knows will be a slow , agonizing death as it destroys his liver .
It 's pretty transparent that he was " suicided " and THEN they can blame him all they want and attribute behaviors and motives to him that they would never be able to get away with on a patsy that is defending himself for example in an open trial situation .
Blaming a dead man is MUCH easier .
Let 's instead look at the facts :
The anthrax letters targeted who ?
Sens. Daschle and Leahy , at the time the two outspoken opponents of the Patriot Act .
They got sent anthrax letters and it did two things :
One , it scared the hell out of Daschle and Leahy , who quickly changed their tune regarding passage of the Patriot Act .
And two , because of the anthrax contamination the Capitol Building itself and many of its associated office buildings were shut down for the whole time the Patriot Act SHOULD HAVE BEEN debated on the floor of the Senate and exposed for the modern version of Hitler 's Enabling Acts that it is , but instead was not read by the senators who were operating disjointedly out of separate hotel rooms and other locations .
Patriot
Act gets passed .
The anthrax attack , like 9/11 , was an inside job done by elements within the U.S. government to achieve neo-con objectives .
This is so obvious to anyone bothering to look into the details of either of those events that literally someone in middle school or even elementary should be able to put it together .

And since we 're on the subject of false flag attacks , has anybody ever wondered if all of the supposed suicide car bombings in Iraq are actually suicide car bombings ?
I realize that some of them obviously are , for example the ones that target the fascist U.S. occupiers and their Iraqi toadies .
But who really gains from the ones that are described as a suicide bomber driving a car packed with explosives into a marketplace and killing dozens of Iraqi civilians who are minding their own business ?
The only ones that gain from THOSE bombings are the American militarists who use it to tar legitimate Iraqi resistance as being callous and bloodthirsty , killing indiscriminately .
But if that is the case that the bombings targeting Iraqi civilians are done by for example the C.I.A. , how would they actually accomplish it ?
Well , there is more than one way .
For one thing , they could take a random Iraqi driving a car in Baghdad into custody for several hours , rig his car with a bomb and then release him , apologizing for a case of “ mistaken identity ” , then let him go on his way in his rigged car , then detonate it by remote control when he reaches a marketplace or other crowded area .
This has actually been known to have been attempted at least once , as disclosed by the intended Iraqi “ suicide bomber ” who got suspicious and left his car to proceed on foot , saving his life as it exploded a few minutes later .
But another way is less involved .
For several years now , since 2003 on the open market ( and surely before that in C.I.A. channels ) there has been available for purchase by anyone who wants one a device that allows remote control of full - sized cars .
Called the AX2550 and developed by Roboteq , it has even been featured on t.v .
http://www.roboteq.com/i...p;catid=56&Itemid=87
All the C.I.A. bastards would have to do would be to get an old car that still runs , install the AX2550 apparatus in it , rig it with explosives and place a mannequin in the driver ’s seat .
A chase car behind it would have the controller “ driving ” the bomb car to its destination , like a crowded marketplace , and then it would be detonated by remote control .
Voila .
Instant “ suicide car bombing that kills 20 Iraqi civilians in a marketplace , showcasing how uncaring and bloodthirsty and insane the Iraqi Rebels are ” .

This article is part of a series called How to Write a Resume .
To start this series from the beginning , read the introduction .
I ’ve used a few bad words in my life .
S$it , you probably have too .
But when the wrong words appear on your resume , it sucks .
These sucky words are not of the four - letter variety .
These words are common .
They are accepted .
They litter the average resume with buzzword badness .
Hiring managers can identify sucky words in seconds , leaving your resume work worthless .
So how do you write a wicked resume without the suck ?
How do you turn the wrong words into right ?
To help you land the job interview , here ’s how to spin the 6 sucky resume words into skills that sizzle .
1. Responsible For
My lips pucker and make sour sucking noises when I read “ Responsible For ” on a resume .
Of course you ’re responsible for something .
But how many ?
How long ?
Who ?
What ?
When ?
Rather than waste the hiring manager ’s time reading a vague list of responsibilities , be specific and use quantitative figures to back up your cited skills and accomplishments .
Employers want the numerical facts .
Write percentages , dollar amounts , and numbers to best explain your accomplishments .
Be specific to get the point across quickly .
Prove you have the goods to get hired .
BAD Responsible for writing user guides on deadline .
GOOD
Wrote six user guides for 15,000 users two weeks before deadline .
BAD Responsible for production costs .
GOOD Reduced production costs by 15 percent over three months .
The resume that avoids vague “ responsibilities ” and sticks to facts detailing figures , growth , reduced costs , number of people managed , budget size , sales , and revenue earned gets the job interview .
2. Experienced
Are you experienced ?
Sexy .
Rather than cite Jimi Hendrix on your resume , pleeease just say what your experience entails .
Saying you ’re experienced at something and giving the facts on that experience are two very different approaches .
BAD Experience programming in PHP .
GOOD Programmed an online shopping cart for a Fortune 500 company in PHP .
Hiring managers want to know what experience , skills , and qualifications you offer .
Do tell them without saying , “ I am experienced . ”
3. Excellent written communication skills
Yes , I realize this is n’t a single word but rather a phrase .
This phrase must die .
It ’s on most resumes .
Is it on yours ?
BAD I have excellent written communication skills .
GOOD Wrote jargon - free online help documentation and reduced customer support calls by 50 percent .
If you ’ve got writing skills , do say what you write and how you communicate .
Are you writing email campaigns , marketing materials , or user documentation ?
Are you word smithing legal contracts , business plans , or proposing proposals ?
However you wrap your words , be sure to give the details .
4. Team Player
Are we playing baseball here ?
Unless you want to be benched with the other unemployed “ team players ” then get some hard facts behind your job pitch .
BAD Team player working well in large and small groups .
GOOD Worked with clients , software developers , technical writers , and interface designers to deliver financial reporting software three months before deadline .
If you want to hit a home run then do explicitly say what teams you play on and qualify the teams ’ achievements .
5. Detail Oriented
What does detail oriented mean ?
Give the specifics to the details with which you are oriented .
Please , orient your reader to the details .
BAD Detail oriented public relations professional .
GOOD Wrote custom press releases targeting 25 news agencies across Europe .
If you have the details , do share them with the hiring manager .
Give the facts , the numbers , the time lines , the dollar figure , the quantitative data that sells your skills and disorients the competition .
6. Successful
Hopefully you only list the successes on your resume .
So if everything is a success , then why write the s-word ?
Stick to showing your success by giving concrete examples of what you ’ve done to be successful !
Let your skills , qualifications , and achievements speak for you .
BAD Successfully sold the product .
GOOD Increased sales of organic chocolate by 32 percent .
When it comes to your successes , please do n’t be shy .
Boast your best , sing your praises , and sell your skills .
Final Words
There you have it .
Six of the suckiest words ( or phrases ) commonly found on resumes today .
By focusing on the facts , detailing the details , and qualifying your qualifications you may just land yourself the job interview .
Sorry to get into this again , but as much as I want to ignore it , this one ’s significant .
Ubisoft have stated that they ’re artificially delaying the launch of EndWar on PC because of , you guessed it , piracy .
Talking to VideoGaming247 , Ubisoft Shanghai director and former Total War “ Evangelist ” , Michael de Plater said ,
“ To be honest , if PC was n’t pirated to hell and back , there ’d probably be a PC version coming out the same day as the other two . ”
He continues ,
“ But at the moment , if you release the PC version , essentially what you ’re doing is letting people have a free version that they rip off instead of a purchased version .
Piracy ’s basically killing PC . ”
This hardly seems worth saying , but of course we in no way endorse piracy .
Illegally downloading games is , well , illegal .
But what we want – what we want so much that our sides ache and our foreheads pulse – is for the truth to be at the centre of this discussion .
We want people who make these decisions , who give comments like this , to present the facts and figures that back up their statements .
We want to see the demonstrable evidence for the harm piracy has on sales .
Because if it ’s true , then yes , action needs to be taken .
But if it is n’t ( and history suggests it very well might not be – the most successful formats in the last 30 years have always been the most pirated , with the DS currently proving this on a dramatic scale ) , then untold damage is being done to the PC platform by claims like this .
What ’s fascinating here is to consider whether this is an isolated case , or whether this attitude is endemic amongst publishers .
Is this why we ’re not seeing Mirror ’s Edge on PC until next year ?
Does this explain why GTA takes nine months to find its way onto our preferred platform ?
Are we missing out on Fable 2 because of a fear of the pirates ?
Halo 3 ?
Has the reputation of the PC , so far entirely without corroborating evidence , hobbled it ?
At the moment it feels like an out - of - control rumour is driving a steamroller over the PC .
Increasing numbers of publishers , who frankly would n’t exist if it were n’t for the PC , are jumping on board .
And this is despite the continued huge sales on PC via the dramatic success of digital distribution .
The perceived , received opinion is that , “ If someone downloads a copy of a game , that ’s a lost sale . ”
As much as this might immediately appear to make sense , a moment ’s scrutiny reveals it to be , so far , entirely unfounded .
( Stardock ’s Brad Wardell wrote eloquently on this subject earlier this year ) .
Surely the people publishing games should be desperately researching to find out why their PC games might not be selling in the volumes they might hope , rather than just assuming it ’s piracy , and then declaring it as a fact .
It might be piracy !
It really might be .
But without evidence , without facts and figures to back this claim up , it can only be considered hearsay , and deeply unproductive .
So come on publishers , put your mouth where your money is , and organise some research into this .
Demonstrate that PC piracy damages console sales , and you ’ll win our attention .
From that point , we can start creating imaginative new methods of controlling the problem .
Until then , actively hobbling the PC yourselves is quite the self - fulfilling tragedy .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Apple
Inc probably will be sued by investors unhappy with the company ’s about - face on the health of its visionary chief executive , but the law is not clear on what duty the company has to disclose personal medical information , legal experts said on Wednesday .
Apple said CEO Steve Jobs , 53 , will take a medical leave of absence until June .
The announcement that comes just nine days after the pancreatic cancer survivor downplayed investor concerns about his dramatic weight loss in recent months , saying it was caused by an easily treatable hormone imbalance .
Analysts and investors complained that Apple was slow to disclose Jobs ’ true medical status and to form a succession plan after his 2004 cancer treatment because of his crucial role in vetting the company ’s forward - looking designs .
“ It is a gray area because what is personal and what ’s a fiduciary responsibility ? ” Ashok Kumar , an analyst with investment banking firm Collins Stewart LLC , said .
“ Steve ’s presence at Apple probably carries significantly more weight than ... Michael Dell ’s presence at Dell . ”
The company ’s share price dropped as much as 10 percent on the announcement despite some analysts ’ belief that a potential Jobs health crisis was “ baked in ” to the price .
Although securities lawsuits usually arise from companies ’ false statements about material aspects of their businesses , Apple could run into trouble by falsely allaying investors concerns about whether Jobs would remain at its helm .
Plaintiffs and defense attorneys said this type of fraud allegation would be hard to prove and a first of its kind .
‘ THE MOST PRIVATE PART OF HIS LIFE ’
“ It is extremely difficult because it is the most private part of his life , ” Steve Williams , a plaintiffs attorney for Cotchett Pitre & McCarthy , said .
“ At the same time , Apple is Steve Jobs . ”
Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Joseph Grundfest said Apple crossed no line if it failed to provide thorough disclosures about Jobs ’ health unless company insiders traded on the knowledge before it was disclosed publicly .
No securities rules and no legal precedents directly address CEO health but Grundfest acknowledged that investors could argue that Jobs ’ status as CEO was critical to their decision to invest in Apple .
“ I never underestimate the cleverness of plaintiffs attorneys but I personally am aware of no theory that would support a filing of a case , ” Grundfest said .
Williams said , however , that Apple may have “ minimized ” Jobs ’ illness in the same way that pharmaceutical companies sometimes fail to promptly and thoroughly disclose how drugs are faring in government trials -- a frequent lawsuit target .
“ If the company misled me by giving me the impression that ( Jobs ) was going to continue to lead the company , that could be an actionable statement , ” Williams said .
But a defense attorney said investors probably would need a “ smoking gun ” to overcome the company ’s likely defense that Jobs ’ medical condition was constantly evolving .
“ In the absence of some memo from a doctor that contradicts what he is saying , I would think it would be problematic for a plaintiffs ( to sue for disclosure lapses ) , ” said the attorney , who asked not to be named because his firm is litigating with Apple .
“ It is not the same as looking at a piece of financial information at the end of the month . ”
By now , everyone has heard that the current financial crisis is the worst since the Great Depression .
Is this also going to turn out to be the longest recession since the Depression ?
The National Bureau of Economic Research — the widely acknowledged arbiter of recessions — announced today that a recession began in December 2007 .
That means the downturn is now a year old , and no one thinks it ’s on the verge of ending .
Here are the longest recessions of the last century :
1929 - 33 : 43 months
1910 - 12 : 24 months
1913 - 14 : 23 months
1920 - 21 : 18 months
1973 - 75 : 16 months
1980 - 81 : 16 months
Economists have been forecasting that the current recession will likely end sometime in the spring ( which is , presumably , when some of the new stimulus money will start to be spent ) .
If they ’re right , this recession will be roughly as long as the 1973 - 75 recession and the 1980 - 81 recession , both of which were 16 months .
To find a longer one than that , you have to go back to the Depression .
Remember , too , that forecasters have been far too optimistic over the past year .
At some point , that will change .
But for now , the best bet seems to be that this recession will last for more than 16 months .
The Hassle of Unicode ( and Getting On With It in Python )
Let ’s face facts .
Unicode is a hassle [ 1 ]
Not using unicode is a hassle , especially if you have one of thoese “ weirdo ” languages , and * gasp* , you want to read text * in your own language * .
I was faced with a simple task .
Take some text , process it , and print out some results ( in JSON ) .
This should be trivial , and in a world where programming
was invented by a multinational consortium , and designed from the first day to be compatible with all text , maybe it would be .
Instead we have a world with a rich history of mutual incompatibility .
Text vs. Bytestreams
We english speakers are used to thinking about text as a series of bytes , that maps one - to - one onto a set of glyphs ( a - zA - Z0 - 9 and various control characters … i.e. , the stuff on a US keyboard ) .
One byte = one character = one glyph .
Simple , right ?
But limiting ….
we only get 256 choices !
A major driving idea of unicode is to reframe thinking of thing in terms of code points .
If you want more details , try these sources :
So , how do I deal with it ?
My solution is to try to get all bytestreams I encounter into unicode , and then use python do deal with it .
Then when it comes time to deal with io again , output the unicode back into a bytestreams .
Python has tons of support for unicode , but it can be confusing to use ( especially for me ) .
Memory aid :
DECODE : bytes -> Unicode Object
ENCODE : Unicode Object -> bytes
# our bytestream , which should contain an " small latin n with tilde " glyph b='Ensexf1anza Txe9cnica ' assert unicode ( b , ' latin1 ' ) == b.decode ( " latin1 " ) for o in b : print ( o , ord ( o ) ) ## the original problem ... import sys if sys.version_info < ( 2,6 ) : import simplejson as json else : import json json.dumps ( b ) '''
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " " , line 1 , in ?
File " /usr/lib64/python2.4/site-packages/simplejson/__init__.py " , line 225 , in dumps return _default_encoder.encode( obj )
File " /usr/lib64/python2.4/site-packages/simplejson/encoder.py " , line 188 , in encode return encode_basestring_ascii(o ) UnicodeDecodeError : ' utf8 ' codec can't decode bytes in position 4 - 7 : invalid data ''' # understanding the error try : json.dumps ( b ) except Exception , E1 : pass try : unicode ( b , 'utf8 ' ) except Exception , E2 : pass # the errors are the same enough assert E1.__dict__ == E2.__dict__ [ / sourcecode ]
So , what 's the problem here ?
We see the character " xf1 " has an ordinal value of " 241 " , meaning it can't be understood as ascii .
Implicitly , simplejson is trying to encode the string as UTF8 unicode before dumping .
Is " xf1 " valid in UTF8 ?
To learn more about this letter , we can do some experiments .
[ sourcecode language = " python " ] # our tilde n n = ' xf1 ' assert type ( n ) = type ( ' ' ) # it 's a string assert ord(n ) == 241 assert n.decode ( ' latin1 ').encode ( 'utf8 ' ) == ' xc3xb1 ' assert ' xc3xb1'.decode ( 'utf8 ' ) == u'xf1 ' [ / sourcecode ]
So , it 's " xf1 " sometimes , and " xc3xb1 " sometimes ?
What the heck is going on ?
If we look at the " < a href = " http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00f1/index.htm " >latin small letter n with tilde < / a > " page , we see that the < strong > " code point " < / strong > associated with this < strong >
* glyph *</ strong > is represented different ways in different encodings , as listed in the " encodings " section .
In Latin - 1 , it 's " xf1 " and in UTF - 8 , it 's " xc3xb1 " .
Simplejson thought it was seeing a UTF - 8 bytestream , when it was really seeing a bytestream indended to be viewed through the lens of Latin - 1. < a href = " https://writeonly.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/tilde-n.png " >< img class = " size - medium wp-image - 135 " title = " tilde - n " src= " https://writeonly.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/tilde-n.png?w=188 " alt="//www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00f1/index.htm " width = " 188 " height =
" 300 " /></a>
So what do we actually have ?
Encoding the unicode object as UTF16 will give us a good view of what 's actually inside the unicode object ( essentially , displaying the code points ) .
def _twobite ( uni ) : ''' take a unicode object and make it into nice two - byte sequences to show better what 's going on inside the unicode object ''' if not type ( uni ) == type ( u '' ) : raise ValueError , " must be unicode type " enc = uni.encode ( ' utf16 ' ) return [ enc[ ii : ii + 2 ] for ii in xrange ( len ( enc ) ) if not ii % 2 ] print _twobite (n.decode ( ' latin1 ' ) ) # [ ' xffxfe ' , ' xf1x00 ' ] # if the endian order on your machine is different , your tuples may be reversed # use the unichr function to verify this print _twobite ( unichr ( 241 ) ) # 241 -> " f1 "
Putting it all together
Let ’s see if we can simply code our way out it , using simplejson , and ignore the issue altogeher :
json.dumps(b, encoding=' latin1 ') # works fine , but assumes we know what # encoding we already have for the bytestream .
json.dumps(b, ensure_ascii=False ) # ignores the problem , passing through # the string untouched
Both of those work fine , for what they do .
Ideally though , I do n’t want to have to think about what the strange text coming in is .
I just want a guarantee that I have valid unicode ( eventually encodable into UTF8 ) , to use as I see fit [ 2 ] .
def _to_unicode ( str , verbose = False ) : ''' attempt to fix non uft - 8 string into utf - 8 , using a limited set of encodings ' '' # fuller list of encodings at http://docs.python.org/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings if not str : return u '' u =
None # we could add more encodings here , as warranted .
encodings = ( ' ascii ' , ' utf8 ' , ' latin1 ' ) for enc in encodings : if u : break try : u = unicode ( str, enc ) except UnicodeDecodeError : if verbose : print " error for %s into encoding %s " % ( str , enc ) pass if not u : u = unicode ( str , errors= ' replace ' ) if verbose : print " using replacement character for %s " % str return u assert json.dumps( _to_unicode( b ) ) == '" Ense\u00f1anza T\u00e9cnica " ' type(json.loads(json.dumps(_to_unicode ( b ) ) ) ) == type( u '') print json.loads(json.dumps(_to_unicode ( b ) ) )
Our world of Babel [ 3 ] makes things complicated enough already .
So , go forth in to this land , waving the banner of UTF - 8 .
Maybe some world builder will finally tell us the secrets of the universe , and we ’ll be able to read them , instead of seeing a row of empty boxes .
Notes :
At least until Python 3 gets to be the usual state of affairs .
For example , I might want to take the text , and replace all latin - 1 with “ nearest ascii equivalents ” .

and focusing on comment 3 and its use of the “ unicodedata ” module .

3. ) Dolichol Inhibition
Dolichols are vital to the process of glycoprotein formation in the endoplasmic reticula of cells .
In this capacity it is critical to the formation of the glycoproteins involved in neuropeptides , cell identification , cell messaging and immunodefense .
Reduced bioavailability of dolichols can affect every cellular process in the body .
Neuropeptide Dysfunction Potential Side Effects :
Aggressiveness
Hostility
Irritability
Road Rage
Homicidal Behavior
Depression
Suicide
Altered Glycoprotein Synthesis Potential Side Effects :
Impairment of DNA error correction
Dysfunction of almost any cellular process
Altered cell identification
Altered cell messaging
Altered immunodefense
4. ) Tau Protein Synthesis
When normal phosphorylation is interfered with by mevalonate blockade , our cells increase the production of Tau protein .
Tau is the protein substance of the neurofibrilatory tangles common to Alzheimer 's and other neurodegenerative diseases .
Neuro - Degenerative Diseases Include :
Parkinson's Disease
Alzheimer 's Disease
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS )
Primary Lateral Sclerosis ( PLS )
Multiple Sclerosis ( MS )
Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA )
Frontal Lobe Dementia
5. ) Selenoprotein
Only recently discovered were selenoproteins and the effect of statin blockade of the mevalonate pathway on their role in human physiology .
Deficiency of selenoproteins has been proven to result in various types of myopathies formerly seen only in areas known to be deficient in this trace element .
Additionally cognitive dysfunction is known to be associated with selenium lack .
6. ) Nuclear Factor - kappa B ( NF - kB )
The benefit of statin drugs in cardiovascular disease control is in their ability to inhibit this vital transcriptase .
The entire anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect of statins is mediated by statin inhibition of nuclear factor - kappa B. Improvement in atherosclerosis results from the inhibition of the key inflammatory elements : smooth muscle migration .
lymphocyte adhesion , macrophage attraction and platelet activation associated with inhibition of NF - kB .
The immunodefense system is also keyed to NF - kB , explaining the changing patterns of certain infections and cancers .
The rise in cancers of all kinds secondary to statin use is of major concern .
One by one , companies have started announcing earnings in which the full pain of the current economic crisis has hit their bottom line .
Microsoft was no exception ; while revenue increased slightly year - over - year , earnings dropped slightly .
The company has a tradition of hosting an additional financial call in which it looks forward to the second half of its fiscal year and discusses long - term plans .
The latest version of that call took place Tuesday morning , hosted by Steve Ballmer and CFO Chris Liddell , who gave a much clearer picture about the company 's view of these turbulent economic times .
The call clearly suggested more grim news was on its way .
Liddell described how the finances held steady through the fiscal first quarter , and only started to decline during the second , with the later portion of the second quarter being significantly worse than the first .
That decline shows no sign of abating , as Liddell said , " we expect conditions to remain similar throughout the second half . "
More generally , Ballmer suggested that Microsoft 's general take on things is that the current crisis represents a " major deleveraging " event and , historically , the economy tends to take a long time to reset to a new level after these events ; growth does n't start again until that reset takes place .
This is a bit more pessimistic than some economists , but gives a sense of the company 's bunker mentality .
To help ride out the storm , Microsoft is planning to reduce expenses , primarily through cuts that total a bit over $ 2 billion in the second half of the year ; beyond that , plans are to keep expenses flat for fiscal 2010 .
But it was very clear that Microsoft was n't simply going to keep cutting until it had satisfied analysts .
" It 's not like anybody 's able to cut costs fast enough — in any industry — to retain the profits of yesteryear , " Ballmer said , and he repeatedly emphasized that R&D spending was essential to its plans to compete in a number of markets that Microsoft considered too important to give up on .
There were also a number of expenses that the company would surely like to avoid , but generally could n't .
" Our legal budget , " Ballmer said , " is likely to be larger than the legal budget of the average company of our size . "
Core businesses
Ballmer mentioned Apple 's rise in market share , saying it was too large to ignore , but not as big as press reports might suggest .
When it comes to market share , the second - biggest competitor remains pirated Windows , which also has the advantage of being free .
Ballmer went through each of the areas that the company views as major business focuses .
For the most part , the traditional Microsoft businesses are doing well .
Client software remains very profitable , although it is taking a bit of a hit .
Consumer spending is shifting to netbooks , and it is very clear that Microsoft is getting far fewer profits from the version of XP it has prepared for these devices .
Ballmer emphasized that he feels that Microsoft can compete with Linux on features in this device category , and plans on having a version of Windows 7 that will do so , but it 's clear that the competition with a free alternative is hurting , and the pain may get worse , as the company fully expects that Android - based netbooks are an inevitability .
Ballmer mentioned Apple 's rise in market share , saying it was too large to ignore , but not as big as press reports might suggest .
When it comes to market share , the second - biggest competitor remains pirated Windows , which also has the advantage of being free .
Piracy is an even bigger problem with productivity applications like Office , where the other competition , such as OpenOffice , remains even weaker than the OS competitors .
In the consumer space , Microsoft has dropped prices and seen the increased sales offset the profit decline , and it appears willing to tolerate poor profits from educational pricing indefinitely .
Ballmer confirmed that Office 14 wo n't be arriving this year , so his market will have to coast a bit going forward .
In the Enterprise , the company has been able to avoid dropping prices by offering integration with its other enterprise products , and upselling it as part of a larger package of services .
Enterprise sales in general , while seeing declines , have held up better due to the long - term contracting , which Liddell termed " annuity sales . "
This is especially true for server and tools , where two - thirds of the sales fall in the annuity category .
The big competition for servers remains Linux , which is dominating Web serving and scientific computing ( Windows dominates in business application and infrastructure workloads ) .
Price clearly remains the sticking point here , and Ballmer announced that there will be a Windows " Foundation Edition " Server released this year , which will sell on the low - end servers that he called " akin to netbooks . "
He also acknowledged the difficulty of competing with Oracle , which is outspending Microsoft both in terms of R&D and marketing .
The big hope there is in new " datacenter " and Azure / cloud versions of SQL Server ; elsewhere , Ballmer noted that corporate migrations to cloud services were going well so far , although the move happens slowly .
Browsers , smartphones , and search
Ballmer highlighted the browser market in red , as it's one area where the company is seeing significant market share losses — he unironically termed browsers " key features of operating systems " at the same time he emphasized that Firefox is the primary cause of IE 's decline .
IE8 was touted as the big hope for reversing that , but it 's not clear what reality that optimism is derived from .
The IE team is struggling with compatibility issues while its competitors push to meet new Web standards .
Ballmer recognized that , in the consumer space , the momentum lies with Apple , but said it 's with Windows Mobile and Android outside of that space .
He then went on to explain why everyone other than Microsoft had it wrong .
Windows Mobile fell into the " somewhat unprofitable " category , but the attention lavished on it suggests that Microsoft has awakened to its strategic importance .
The company is apparently hoping that it will be able to leverage some of the desktop OS development to increase its slow pace of development .
Ballmer said , " the amount of technology that can be shared across that border continues to go up , " and he combined the R&D budgets of the two groups in an attempt to show how well it stacked up against competitors like RIM .
Ballmer recognized that , in the consumer space , the momentum lies with Apple , but said it 's with Windows Mobile and Android outside of that space .
He then went on to explain why everyone other than Microsoft had it wrong .
Referring to Android , he said , " I do n't know how it is a sustainable thing to not have a positive price , " and he argued that he expects the Windows Mobile model , in which hardware and software is divorced , to win out in the end .
The key message here is that you should n't expect Microsoft to be making its own phone , which Ballmer said , " is not our strategy . "
Of course , similar things were once said about portable music players , and yet we have the Zune .
That 's apparently different , because it 's part of a tool for a larger entertainment strategy .
Ballmer promised that the Zune entertainment services would be coming to all three screens : the PC , the TV , and portable devices .
The Xbox is simply another cog in this strategy , as Microsoft is looking to develop a " dollars per TV " revenue strategy — " the real opportunity is a device that sits next to or in a TV set , " said Ballmer .
The precise device involved is apparently far less relevant than the fact that Microsoft is on the end of the revenue stream .
It 's an interesting take , and one that the company may now have the pieces in place to attempt , but , without some well - enunciated roadmap to get there from here , it has a bit of the feel of a post - hoc rationalization .
Ballmer made a more compelling case when discussion arose about another market the company has struggled in , search advertising .
He argued that search is the key advertising business and portal properties could , at best , support the growth of a search property .
He also described how search and the ads run with it were mutually reinforcing : consumers , consciously or not , rate the credibility of the search results in part by evaluating the relevance of the ads that appear with it .
But if Microsoft had a more compelling case for the importance of search , it did n't have a clearer roadmap on competing in that market .
Ballmer is still interested in combining with Yahoo to take on Google , and is n't picky about how it gets there .
But , beyond that , it appears focused on new product releases , something that the consumer population does n't seem to really register .
This mixed strategic vision — Microsoft has identified some key markets for growth , but does n't seem to have a concrete plan for actually growing in them — is probably more worrisome than the grim financial news .
Microsoft is likely to be taking a bigger hit as the fiscal year continues to be dominated by bad news , but it probably wo n't be as bad as the hits that many other companies have taken , and Redmond appears well positioned to continue to excel in the markets it already dominates when the economy recovers .
But , in Apple , Google , and RIM , it 's facing competitors that appear to have a clearer picture of what needs to be accomplished in these other markets .
In cases like the TV set - top , where there really is n't competition , Microsoft does n't appear to have an equivalent picture .
If there 's something in the works behind the scenes , this press call did n't lift the curtain on it .

A team of astronomers led by John Johnson of the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy has used a new technique to measure the precise size of a planet around a distant star .
They used a camera so sensitive that it could detect the passage of a moth in front of a lit window from a distance of 1,000 miles .
The camera , mounted on the UH 2.2 - meter telescope on Mauna Kea , measures the small decrease in brightness that occurs when a planet passes in front of its star along the line - of - sight from Earth .
These " planet transits " allow researchers to measure the diameters of worlds outside our solar system .
" While we know of more than 330 planets orbiting other stars in our Milky Way galaxy , we can measure the physical sizes of only the few that line up just right to transit , " explains Johnson .
The team studied a planet called WASP - 10 b , which was thought to have an unusually large diameter .
They were able to measure its diameter with much higher precision than before , leading to the finding that it is one of the densest planets known , rather than one of the most bloated .
The planet orbits the star WASP - 10 , which is about 300 light - years from Earth .
IfA astronomer John Tonry designed the camera , known as OPTIC ( Orthogonal Parallel Transfer Imaging Camera ) , and it was built at the IfA .
It uses a new type of detector , an orthogonal transfer array , the same type used in the Pan - STARRS 1.4 Gigapixel Camera , the largest digital camera in the world .
These detectors are similar to the CCDs ( charge - coupled devices ) commonly used in scientific and consumer digital cameras , but they are more stable and can collect more light , which leads to higher precision .
" This new detector design is really going to change the way we study planets .
It 's the killer app for planet transits , " said team member Joshua Winn of MIT .
The precision of the camera is high enough to detect transits of much smaller planets than previously possible .
It measures light to a precision of one part in 2,000 .
For the first time , scientists are approaching the precision needed to measure transits of Earth - size planets .
Bigger planets block more of the star 's surface and cause a deeper brightness dip .
The diameter of WASP - 10 b is only 6 percent larger than that of Jupiter , even though WASP - 10 b is three times more massive .
Correspondingly , its density is about three times higher than Jupiter's .
Because their interiors become partially degenerate , Jovian planets have a nearly constant radius across a wide range of masses .
The photometric precision is three to four times higher than that of typical CCDs and two to three times higher than the best CCDs , and comparable to the most recent results from the Hubble Space Telescope for stars of the same brightness .
A senior Bush administration official has admitted that a Guantánamo Bay detainee was tortured by the US military , leaving him in a " life - threatening condition " .
Susan Crawford , the Pentagon official in charge of military tribunals at the camp , said Mohammed al - Qahtani , a Saudi suspected of involvement in the September 11 terrorist plot , was subject to sustained isolation , sleep deprivation , nudity and prolonged exposure to cold .
She said the torture meant he could not be prosecuted .
" We tortured Qahtani , " she told the Washington Post .
" His treatment met the legal definition of torture .
And that 's why I did not refer the case [ for prosecution ] . "
Crawford is the first senior Bush administration official responsible for reviewing practices at Guantánamo to admit publicly that a detainee was tortured .
Speaking publicly for the first time since her appointment two years ago , Crawford said the physical harm suffered by Qahtani – as well as the combination and duration of interrogation techniques used against him – took his treatment into the threshold of torture .
" The techniques they used were all authorised , but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent , " she said .
" You think of torture , you think of some horrendous physical act done to an individual .
This was not any one particular act ; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him , that hurt his health .
It was abusive and uncalled for .
And coercive .
Clearly coercive . "
Crawford added that " it was that medical impact that pushed me over the edge " to call it torture .
Qahtani , 30 , was barred entry to America in August 2001 and is alleged by US authorities to be the 9/11 plot 's " 20th hijacker " .
He was captured in Afghanistan in 2002 and brutally interrogated for 48 days using a plan approved by the former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
" For 160 days [ Qahtani's ] only contact was with the interrogators , " said Crawford .
" Forty - eight of 54 consecutive days of 18 - to 20 - hour interrogations .
Standing naked in front of a female agent .
Subject to strip searches and insults to his mother and sister . "
His treatment twice resulted in his hospitalisation with serious heart problems .
A military report shows Qahtani was threatened with a military dog , forced to wear a bra and told his mother and sister " were whores " .
He was attached to a leash and " forced to perform a series of dog tricks " .
The US dropped the death penalty case against Qahtani in May last year without explanation .
His lawyers at the time attributed it to evidence he had been tortured while in US custody .
In November , military prosecutors said they would seek to renew charges based on subsequent interrogations that did not employ harsh techniques .
Crawford said she would block that prosecution .
The US president - elect , Barack Obama , who has promised to close Guantánamo Bay , hinted at the weekend at the difficulties his incoming administration will face in dealing with " very dangerous " terrorist suspects who have been tortured .
" It is more difficult than I think a lot of people realise , " he told ABC News , " and we are going to get it done , but part of the challenge that you have is that you have a bunch of folks that have been detained , many of whom may be very dangerous , who have not been put on trial or have not gone through some adjudication .
And some of the evidence against them may be tainted , even though it 's true . "
Over the past year our readers have submitted some excellent hints and tips for making swallowing cum a fun and easy experience .

Some women do n’t like to swallow semen because of the sharp sensation it leaves in their throat .
And there is nothing much to do about that .
What I found to be the next best thing ( possibly even better ) is that she slowly lets it ooze out of her mouth while sucking ( best done while sitting up ) .

There are also flavored condoms for your pleasure .
- Neva , New York I 've always swallowed .
Now , I love seeing the look on my husband 's face as our eyes are locked on the other 's and he shoots his streams of cum into my mouth .
It 's just magical .
However the taste is something that I 've never really gotten used to .
Over the years I 've learned to deep throat him completely even though he 's about 8 inches and average thickness .
I 've learned from asking him that it 's almost more enjoyable for him to cum while he's in my throat than it is when he 's shooting it all over my tongue and the back of my mouth .
The big advantage it gives me when I deep throat him and he comes is that I never taste it .
When I sense he 's starting to have his orgasm I just take a deep breath and push his cock down my throat as far as I can and begin swallowing .
That method has n't failed to make him have an immediate orgasm .
He says my swallowing almost feels like I 'm finishing him off with a hand job around the head of his cock .

It is erotic when you swallow cum .
At first , it 's yucky , but keep in mind that you accept the guy in your life - you accept everything in him .
If you can't swallow the whole cum at one time , just press the penis a little bit to control the flow of cum and swallow little by little .
Another technique is to deep throat when a guy is near climax and let the cum get down into the throat by itself .
You will never taste anything bad .
Before you know it , all the cum is inside you .

As an earlier poster mentioned , diet has a profound effect on the qualities of the cum .
But while fish may make the taste even worse , some foods can improve the taste somewhat .
Citrus , especially , is good for this .
Drinking a lot of juice ( pineapple seems to work best ) should affect the taste enough to make it bearable .

I tell my mate to let me know when he 's ready to cum , by tapping my head or shoulder .
When he does I take his penis as far back in my mouth as I can .
That way I feel the hot cum , but the taste is not as bad as it would be up front .
Practice on dildos to perfect this technique .
- Bobbie , Kentucky I have a tongue piercing , but its overrated if you know how to use your tongue .
Not too much , but not too little .
Use your tongue on the back of his dick and around the head .
Start slowly at the top like you 're making out with it , then work your way down and increase the speed .
They love it !

I love to taste the payoff of my attentions , but some are much better than others .
I 've noticed that the flavor is much less tasteable when the release is deeper in the throat area , at very least to the back of the tongue , which has no taste buds .
The throbbing is the best warning , and is a delicious sensation , if you can swallow at least the head , or more .
I prefer more .... but the first shot on the tongue is absolutely the best , then down the throat , you get the flavor and the throbbing to enjoy !
- Anonymous , Georgia
I have often found eating a cinnamon candy or chewing cinnamon gum not only masks the flavor but also gives the man a " HOT " blowjob .
I know mine will reach for a pack of Big Red when he 's ready .

If you try to deep throat and are having a problem , use Chloraseptic mouth spray .
It will numb your throat .
I use it and can deep throat 7 inches without any problem .
Also , swallow as soon as the load hits your mouth .
You 'll taste very little that way .
- Bobbie Jo , Kentucky
The day before and day of an anticipated BJ , do the following : Drink plenty of water .
Use a lot of nonsugar sweeteners such as stevia , Splenda , or others .
They are usually more concentrated than sugar , and will not be intercepted by insulin in your bloodstream .
Avoid saccharin , Nutrasweet and other artificial products , as these may be bad for your health .
Add seasonings like vanilla extract , cinnamon , and fruit extracts to foods and drinks whenever possible .
Make blender drinks with fresh or frozen fruit , adding the sweeteners and flavorings mentioned above .
Take supplements like chlorophyll and enteric - coated peppermint .
Avoid fish , beer , milk , cigarettes , red meat , garlic , onions , asparagus , and cabbage .
Thank your girl for making you feel so good !
- Anonymous , U. S. I read in my man 's Playboy about giving BJs and learned this trick .
It really helps .
If you make a fist when he is about to blow and place it between his balls and his asshole , it really cuts down on " the load " that has to be swallowed .
- Anonymous , U. S. I tell my partner to let me know when he 's ready to cum , and just as he 's ready to shoot , I take him all the way down .
This way he cums in my throat but it 's easy to swallow when he takes his Viagra and shoots it deep .
It takes a little practice but when you get it right you will love the way it feels when his semen floods your throat .
And of course , there 's very little mess left over .
Your man will do just about anything for you after you deep throat his load .
- Anonymous , Canada Drink orange juice before a blowjob ... that way the taste is bearable ... and tasty !!!
- Anonymous , U. S. I like to have an average or smaller cock that fits in my mouth perfectly and just put it in the back of my mouth when he cums .
That way it completely skips my taste buds , and I can still feel the pulsations ( which I love ) and the way it feels to drink it .
- Jared , L. A . If you put something in your mouth and then swallow , it will make it taste a little , but ooh baby , it 's worth it !!

I find that it's not the taste of cum that bothers me , it 's the consistency .
Therefore , I get my man to drink fruit juice a couple of hours beforehand , and I take a deep breath as he's about to cum and take him as far down my throat as I can .
That way there 's no icky feeling on my lips .

When my man comes in my mouth I always swallow .
My technique is simple : I have my man put his cock inside my mouth as far as possible and give him a nice head job until his cock swells up and he can't hold it anymore and he comes in my mouth .
There is no pulling his cock out when he starts to come because I want it all , every last drop of cum .
After he pulls his hard cock out of my mouth , I show him his cum in my mouth before I swallow it .
Sometimes I will spit it in my hand and then lick it off my hand , or spit it into my coffee cup - makes my coffee taste 100 percent better .
One more thing , too - instead of jam or butter , I spread cum on my toast - delicious and no calories !
- JJ , U. S. I find it easier to swallow if I give the blowjob upside down .
( Head hanging over the side of the bed , or if you have gravity boots , these are ideal . )
This makes it just slide right down your throat with no thought required .

Diet is the answer .
A few years ago , when I was smoking and drinking like hell , it was easy to guess how it tasted from the expression of my partners .
I quit smoking , drink lot less , do sports , eat huge amounts of protein and healthy stuff .
I happened to taste my cum ( it was an accident , folks ) and man , I 'm happy for the women who taste it - they wo n't crave candy anymore .
- James , L. A . When you feel your man about to come ( usually tightening up or a moan or grunt ) put his cock to the back of your throat so you do n’t need to taste or feel the texture of the cum .

Swallowing cum is mostly psychological .
The thought that cum is an excrement tends to make it seem dirty or unhealthy .
Just remember this as you taste cum - it is the purest of pure .
It has to be to make little babies .
Also , guys need to remember to keep their cocks and crotches clean .
Just like a pussy that 's been well fucked over a period of time , if the cock is n't kept clean , it will smell unenticing .

- Anonymous , Canada Swallowing my man 's cum has never been an issue with me .
It 's something I 've always enjoyed .
He inserts his penis inside my mouth and puts it all the way in and then moves back and forth until he explodes in my mouth .
I sometimes spit it into a glass and then drink it down .
Sometimes I put his cum in my coffee cup ; it 's better than cream .
I would never spit my man 's cum out .
That would be totally wrong and would make your man think you did n't like it .
The taste of cum is a bit different .
However , it 's not as hard to take as you think and if you really have a problem with the taste there 's always mouthwash .
- Amy , U. S. If you do n't like to swallow , just ask your boyfriend if it 's OK if you have a drink next to the bed .
You can come up with an excuse like , " Giving blowjobs makes my mouth dry , " or just say you like to have a drink afterwards .
You could also tell him the truth , but you 'll never know how he 's gonna take it ( it might be insulting ) .
When you have just swallowed , give him a smile and wait a few seconds before reaching over to your drink to get the sperm - taste out of your mouth .
Hardly any man will notice .

My tip is to stick the cock at the very back of your throat when he is going to cum and let it roll down your throat .
This way the girl will taste nothing , maybe a little aftertaste , but that can be solved easily .... and the guy enjoys his whole cock in your mouth .
I do it all the time .
- Anonymous , Canada - I got this hint from my mother ( of all people ) .
She told me to control the " gag " reflex when trying to deep throat , squirt a little Chloraseptic in the back of your throat before going down on your man .
I could never even come close to deep throating my guy till I tried this trick , but it worked fantastic !
Not to say that it still was n't a little uncomfortable , but the reaction from my man was more than enough for me .
He was completely amazed .
More than a year later , I do n't need the Chloraseptic anymore and he thinks I am his own little sex star .

The first time I swallowed , my husband had been drinking Jack Daniels and coke .
Since I was pregnant , I was just drinking a coke .
I was going down and had never swallowed before .
He had cum in my mouth before , but the taste made me sick , so I did n't DARE swallow !
Well , after getting it on for a while , he asked me to suck his dick again .
I did and was I surprised when he moaned very loudly and shuddered !
He had cum in my mouth , and as a reflex , I swallowed .
I did n't even taste it , due to the aftertaste of the coke !
Anyone who is not sure should try it !
Also , flavored , water - based lubricant is absolutely wonderful !
You do n't taste anything but sweetness !

All you can really do is swallow A.S.A.P. , and after a few swallows of your own spit , the taste should be gone .
I actually do n't like deep throating because then the taste goes straight to the bitter - tasting taste buds of your tongue , and that 's usually where the taste stays .
If you just have him cum into the center of your mouth then swallow , the semen will just quickly flow down and the taste does n't linger .
- Bianca , Detroit Watch out for the power shooter !
Sometimes guys shoot with great force .
If he blows a healthy load , you may find yourself choking on his goodness .
If your guy fires forcefully just pull back a bit - it 'll help you from gagging on his cum .

Don't forget to ejaculate regularly , to make sure the taste stays fresh .

When you know he 's about to come , I find its best to direct it into the side of your mouth and then swallow it in one big gulp .
That way you do n't choke on it and you can hardly taste it .

You never know what a guy will taste like , so every time I give a blow job , I tell the guy if he wants me to swallow , to put his hand over my mouth after he cums and make me swallow it .
No matter how bad it tastes , even if he cums a lot , I always swallow doing it this way .
I may feel like barfing , but the feeling passes when a man 's strong hand covers my mouth and his other rubs the front of my neck and forces me to swallow his cum .

I personally really enjoy the flavor of my bloke 's load ... but not after 4 shags in a short space of time , as it gets a bit too salty .
If you make sure the first time he cums is when you 're giving him head , the better it 'll taste .
Otherwise , just keep some water nearby .
The salt 's always good for a sore throat , though ! - B. , Essex
Hold your breath as you swallow .
I learned this because of my parents forcing me to eat ethnic foods that were disgusting .
I would hold my breath as I swallowed and I would not taste a thing .
Having something handy to wash the cum down is a good idea as well .
This has worked for me every time .
- Anonymous , L. A . I am a girl who love , love , loves the taste of my boyfriend 's cum !
The three best tips I can offer : ( 1 ) The flavor and texture of cum noticeably improve when he drinks 3 plus quarts of filtered water a day .
( 2 ) Have your guy rinse with plain water instead of washing with soap , so he 'll be clean but wo n't smell like tallow soap or synthetic fragrance -- which are extremely rank smells that clash with his sexy natural aroma . ( 3 ) I treat myself to leisurely and generous sniffs of his hair , face , neck , his armpits , his balls , and under his balls .
Really taking the time to smell him all over makes for an unbeatable olfactory smorgasbord that goes beautifully with the taste and smell of his cum .
Smelling him is a very intimate and fun experience for both of us , and it stimulates the wild animal in me like little else .

When I know he 's about to cum , I just keep him deep in my throat , let the cum pool there , and then when I can feel he 's finished shooting , swallow in one big gulp .
This usually gets a big moan - something about my throat muscles tightening at the moment of swallowing .

I found out from girls who give head that the best tasting cum is either from a guy who drinks lots of juice , or from a very long blow job .
So girls , take your time , and guys hold back .
Guys , if you need to , just so you do n't come so fast , take a break part way through and eat her out also .

Then when he cums , I slurp and swish and really bob my head mixing the jizz and saliva .
This also seems to help generate more saliva , which helps thin out the jizz .
Guys also seem to really enjoy the " power sucking " right after they cum .
Then with one big gulp , I take it down .
Sometimes I then pull off him and lick his thighs , belly , whatever .
This helps to clean the tongue if needed .

As a man who loves to be sucked ( completely ) , I had to taste my own cum to analyze why girls do n't like swallowing .
I think the bleach smell is the great concern and I think it is caused by red meat consumption .

- Anonymous , U. S. I have found that no matter how large the cock is , it is all a matter of mind over matter as far as gagging is concerned .
With enough practice you will begin to know where your personal threshold is and when the penis is just too deep !
I do n't think it is a good idea to deep throat the whole time , or a vast majority of the time you are giving head , but when he is ready to cum you should go down deep , let it shoot straight down your throat ( this way you wo n't taste it ) , and suck him dry .
I find sucking him dry helps to also get whatever is left in your mouth down also .

Many women find it hard to swallow cum due to the forceful way it shoots down their throats , sometimes causing a gag reflex due to the high velocity and amount of the initial blast .
Here 's a tip .
Pull the penis slightly out of your mouth and touch your tongue to the top of your mouth , blocking the hot / fast injection of semen from hitting the back of your throat .
Proceed to swallow once your mouth is full or he stops shooting .

Try swallowing it together .
After he squirts his load into her mouth , they can kiss a long passionate kiss , slowly consuming the juice together .
Even more satisfying and exciting is for her to keep it in her mouth while he goes down on her until his mouth is fill of her juice , then they can kiss and mix their juices together as they slowly swallow , making a special sauce like no other .
Enjoy :-) ~ - Tom , USA Tips : Play with it for a long while before you actually start the hardcore blowjob , then have him tell you when he 's really close , and backoff , do it a few times and by the time you bring him to cum its just a quick 5 - 10 seconds tops of letting it all pool into your mouth , swallow it and clean anything off by sucking for a few more seconds ... makes it all very fun for him .

Health - Care Service Providers .
The contrarian view is that a warming world would , on balance , improve public health in high - latitude areas .
Though hot regions in the developing world experience high rates of communicable diseases that scare us , people are still far more likely to die from the cold than from heat — overall death rates in winter are much higher than those in summer .
Retirees living in Florida , for instance , have less reason to fear a hot summer than those living in Vermont have to fear a cold winter .
If the cold areas of affluent nations became less cold , we would expect longevity to increase .
That would be good for society , and also a reason to hold health - care ( and pharmaceutical ) stocks , since the elderly require far more in the way of hospital services and drugs .
The assisted - care industry might also be in for a long bullish run .
Electricity Producers .
The World Energy Council has estimated that global demand for electricity will triple by 2050 .
The lion ’s share of the increased demand will be in developing nations , but the United States and the European Union nations will need more megawatts too — and that ’s even assuming increases in energy efficiency .
It is all but certain that some form of greenhouse - gas regulation will come to the United States ; many Fortune 500 CEOs already assume this .
The result will be an electricity sector that ’s much more technology - and knowledge - sensitive than today’s .
Lots of brainpower and skill will be required to increase electricity generation and reduce greenhouse - gas emissions at the same time .
It ’s reasonable to guess that power - production firms with a track record of innovation , such as Duke Energy ( which pioneered many techniques to improve the efficiency of nuclear - power plants ) , will be the kind of energy - sector stocks to own .
Do n’t be surprised if nuclear energy , which is nearly greenhouse - gas - free , enjoys a boom in coming decades .
General Electric , Westinghouse , and Siemens are some of the leading producers of new “ inherently safe ” power reactors designed so they ca n’t melt down even if all safety systems are turned off .
“ Green ” Energy .
Renewable - energy industries — such as solar energy and biofuels — might seem like a promising place for 401 ( k ) chips , but bear in mind that no form of green energy is yet cost - competitive with fossil energy , and no one knows which may eventually win in the marketplace .
Solar - cell production , for example , is an expanding sector , but nearly all large solar cells for residential and commercial applications are currently sold in California , Japan , or Germany , which heavily subsidize the installation of solar power .
Many investors today are racing to ethanol , but wariness seems advisable .
Bill Gates has already invested $ 84 million in a start - up called Pacific Ethanol ; venture - capital firms have moved into the ethanol “ space . ”

Besides , BP and DuPont are now looking past ethanol to bet on butanol , a crop - derived petroleum substitute with superior technical properties .
DOWNTOWN
Seattle may have a Space Needle that pierces the clouds , a Monorail that whizzes above the streets and , most recently , the bloblike Experience Music Project designed by Frank Gehry .
But until recently , it offered little else to draw Seattleites .
The “ real ” Seattle was found along the city ’s fringes , in neighborhoods like Fremont and Ballard , where cheap rents fostered artsy communities and cafe cultures .
In recent years , however , a wave of new condominiums has sprouted near a waterfront once reserved for tchotchke shops selling “ Sleepless in Seattle ” T - shirts , bringing with it fashionable boutiques , trendy restaurants and gourmet shops .
Now , the city center is starting to feel like a neighborhood again , and not just a backdrop for a Space Needle snapshot .

Apparently you can pick up outdated U.S. military files for less than $ 10 .
That 's what happened to New Zealand 's Chris Ogle when he bought a used MP3 player for $ 9 in Oklahoma .
The 29 year old then took his new device home and synced it to his computer , only to discover that it contained U.S. military personnel lists that included social security numbers and cell phone numbers of soldiers stationed overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The files , most of which dated from 2005 , also contained details of equipment inventories from U.S. bases in Afghanistan , and one mission briefing .
" The more I look at it , the more I see and the less I think I should be ! "
Ogle told TVNZ's ONE News .
While the discovery may prove embarrassing to U.S. officials , the outdated files seem to be of little consequence to national security .
However , personal information like social security and phone numbers could have put individual soldiers at risk for identity theft and personal harm .
A similar situation was uncovered in Afghanistan in 2006 when U.S. investigators bought stolen flash drives with military information outside Bagram base - - a major U.S. military outpost in Afghanistan .
In November 2008 , the U.S. Department of Defense banned the use of USB storage devices to prevent leaks like this from happening again .
This was shortly after DoD computers were infected with a worm capable of downloading malware onto the Department 's computers .
The McCain 2008 campaign also experienced a similar issue when a reporter purchased a Blackberry at the campaign 's fire sale that contained secure information .
These issues highlight the bigger problem of keeping sensitive data secure in any large organization .
How , for example , does the Obama Administration plan to keep data secure as it works toward a more open and transparent government ?
Do n't forget that even the President is not immune to Internet security problems :
Hackers recently took advantage of the social networking features on the President 's campaign website my .
barackobama.com to lure unsuspecting visitors to download malware .
During the election hackers also infiltrated the sites for both presidential candidates , Alaska governor Sarah Palin's Yahoo account was hacked during her vice presidential run , and there are security concerns around the President 's new super - secure Blackberry .
With malware on the rise and increasing calls for more effective policing of the World Wide Web , this year promises to be another big year in the fight between hackers and Internet security firms .
As for Ogle 's MP3 player , it 's unclear how the data ended up on the device , and as of this writing the government has yet to release a statement on the issue .
For his part ,
Ogle says he intends to hand over the device to U.S. officials upon request .

Is there a caution sign to be found in the recent turnover at Cleveland City Council ?
" I 'm moving up in seniority , " Ward 12 Councilman Tony Brancatelli quipped last month at a special meeting to swear in Nate Wilkes as the new Ward 2 representative .
Brancatelli , who was appointed to the council in 2005 and elected to a full term later that year , has moved up five spots in three years .
Of 21 members , he ranks 13th in seniority .
His candid comment prompted a look at council seniority .
What 's astounding here is that 10 members -- almost half of the council -- have served less than a full , four - year term .
Four of those 10 have served a year or less .
If you are a fan of term limits , you might take comfort in the fact that more than half of the council members ( 13 ) have served less than two full terms .
But is it fair to ask about the weight of this council 's experience ?
Or , perhaps , its inexperience ?
Since 2005 , public office - hopping has powered much of the leadership vaccum .
Brancatelli and Kelley got their jobs when their predecessors jumped to the mayor 's office on the other side of City Hall .
Keane joined the council after veteran Mike Dolan left to run the Ohio Lottery .
Mitchell stepped in for Patricia Britt , who became the council clerk .
And Pruitt replaced Nina Turner , who went to the Ohio Senate .
Death ( Fannie Lewis ) and corruption ( Bobby White ) claimed two others in 2008 .
In 2009 , it will be entertaining to see which council members ( new , old or both ) receive serious challengers in the municipal elections .
In the last two cycles , veterans Nelson Cintron , Bill Patmon and Craig Willis were kicked to the curb in favor of fresh faces .
Tim Melena left politics .
Frank Jackson gave up his seat to run for mayor .
Will Cintron angle for a comeback against Santiago ?
Will Patmon , who four years ago ran for mayor and was thought by some to be a potential heir to Lewis ' seat , flirt with a return to City Hall ?
Will any council member ( Polensek , Reed ) come out to run against Jackson ?
Tracking mountain lions - for their own good

The tired , sweaty trackers scrambled up a steep , muddy slope in a remote canyon in the Santa Cruz Mountains to the towering madrone tree where the hounds were barking .
Poised on a thick , bare branch on a brilliant day in late December was a panting , snarling mountain lion .
" There she is , straight up above us , " said Paul Houghtaling , a 33 - year - old researcher for the Bay Area Puma Project , as he dug his boots into the soft leaf matter on the nearly vertical hillside .
The muscles in the tawny lion 's back legs rippled 30 feet above him .
The cougar 's mouth was open and her nose was working , sniffing , perhaps , for her cub , which had darted off in another direction .
Led by researchers from UC Santa Cruz , the project is the first attempt to track Bay Area mountain lions , which are being seen in greater numbers as urban areas spread into the region 's wildlands .
For the next three years , the team will track their behavior and movements in the Santa Cruz Mountains - including mating habits , favored prey , survival needs and travel routes .
Researchers hope to expand the study for several more years after that to include the Diablo Range and the North Bay .
The 90 - pound cat turned her gaze from the dogs to the humans , staring first at Houghtaling , then at each of the other five humans as they clambered into view on this brilliant sunny day just before the New Year .
" It is an intense feeling to be in the presence of such a powerful animal , " Houghtaling said .
" I think they feel somewhat safe being in a tree , but they know they are cornered and they are looking for a way out .
I feel a sense of awe and also a sense of responsibility that the animal is being captured and collared for a good reason - namely , that we are increasing our understanding of them and contributing to their long - term conservation . "
The researchers were after the mother lion because they wanted to replace a device called an accelerometer in her collar .
The specially designed gizmo , which uses software similar to that found in interactive video games , will allow researchers to plot movements like running , stalking , pouncing or even mating at any given time .
Since May , four mountain lions - two males and two females - have been captured , darted and fitted with collars that have Global Positioning System devices and an accelerometer .
The other female recently lost her collar during a violent struggle with a deer , the remains of which were later found along with the collar .
Chris Wilmers , the lead investigator for the project , said the data from collars - which can be retrieved every couple of weeks using a remotely triggered radio uplink - will be used to calculate daily calorie consumption and energy demands .
The ultimate goal , he said , is to determine how vulnerable pumas are to environmental and habitat disturbance .
" We want to find out what effect fragmentation of habitat has on their ability to persist in these landscapes , " said Wilmers , an assistant professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz .
" What 's really novel here is that we are asking how habitat fragmentation interacts with the actual physiology of the animal .
It is important information from the Bay Area 's standpoint if we are going to save mountain lions and keep them out of trouble . "
The group tracked the cougar on old logging roads in mountains near the coastal town of Davenport using a handheld antenna , which would beep when pointed in the direction of the GPS device in the animal 's collar .
They bushwhacked through dense brush into a heavily forested ravine known as Little Creek .
State Fish and Game Department tracker Cliff Wylie released his three hounds as soon as they began baying , indicating they had picked up the scent .
The dogs quickly located the buried head and leg of a deer , all that was left of a fresh kill .
Finding the big cat would be harder .
The elusive predator doubled back and took the dogs on a long , circuitous route up and down gullies , through thick forest , across the creek and up a ravine .
She eventually tired out , scampered up the steep slope and scaled the tree .
Standing there high on the limb and backlit by the afternoon sun , she looked wary and curious , like a house cat spying interlopers from the top of a fence .
Her paws were black with mud from the long chase in the lush , wet , leaf - strewn canyon .
" She 's a pretty crafty cat , doubling back like that , " Houghtaling said .
The stress from the chase is probably good for the lions , Wilmers said , because it teaches them to avoid humans .
It is also good for them to have a healthy fear of dogs , a natural enemy going back thousands of years , he said .
Wilmers , who studied wolves in Montana , said wolf packs will attack and kill mountain lions when they see them .
Although a puma will prey on small dogs and might occasionally turn on a lone hound , it will almost always climb a tree to get away from two or more pursuing dogs , an apparently hardwired response to canines .
Wilmers estimates that there are 21 female lions , seven males and 42 kits in the Santa Cruz Mountains .
The cougar in the tree gave birth to as many as three kits , but only one remains , a 60 - pound male juvenile who is almost ready to strike out on his own .
Female lions spend most of their time in one area searching for food and taking care of their young , Wilmers said .
The bigger males , which can weigh 150 pounds or more , roam through their territory protecting their turf from other males and searching for as many mates as they can find .
A GPS map of one of the male lions showed that he had established a home base 17 miles long and 8 miles wide , stretching from Wilder Ranch State Park to Scotts Creek .
The other male roams from Scotts Creek north into Big Basin Redwoods State Park .
The females in the study are based just east of Davenport and in Big Basin .
The two males have been photographed feeding on a meat lure next to the same infrared motion - sensing camera on the edge of their respective territories .
Researchers wonder if the Santa Cruz mountain males are being forced to be more tolerant of one another because their habitat is shrinking .
Development is undoubtedly a big problem in lion territory .
In one 15 - day period , one of the males twice went through suburban neighborhoods , but Wilmers said the cougar traveled at night through undeveloped lots , apparently only to get from one place to another .
Wilmers said the valley near the Coyote Reservoir and agricultural land east of Gilroy are the only places where mountain lions could get to the Hamilton Range and other adjacent woodlands and mountains .
Housing developments have been proposed in both areas .
Several mountain lions have been run over recently while trying to cross Highway 17 .
" We 've got to think about how we maintain connectivity between these areas so that animals can get from one place to the other , " Wilmers said .
" It may be that they only use these corridors to pass through , but if you close them off , you cut off a lot of their habitat . "
The mother lion was lucky on the day in late December .
Wylie , the Fish and Game tracker , determined that he could not dart the animal because of the possibility of her taking a long fall down the cliff underneath the tree .
The group leashed the dogs and pulled back , allowing the wily feline to slip away and meet up again with her cub .
" That 's just the way it goes , " Houghtaling said .
" It 's a tricky situation .
We 'll just try it again and eventually we 'll get her . "
Attacks on humans
There have been 16 verified mountain lion attacks on humans in California since 1890 , including six deaths .
The fatal attacks include : -- January 2004 : Mark Reynolds , 35 , was killed during a mountain bike ride at Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park in Orange County .
The amateur racer 's partially eaten remains were found after the same lion later attacked a female rider , who was saved by fellow riders who drove the lion off as it tried to drag her away .
-- December 1994 : Iris Kenna , 56 , was attacked and killed while hiking alone near Cuyamaca Peak in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park in San Diego County .
-- April 1994 : Barbara Schoener , 40 , was attacked , killed and partially eaten by an 80 - pound cougar while jogging on a trail in the Auburn State Recreation Area in the Sierra foothills .
Officials will lecture families on how to feed themselves properly
In a move branded “ Government nannying at its worst ” , the teams – operated by councils across the country – will be recruited to visit homes at meal times before handing out advice on diet and how to reduce waste .
Eight thousand Food Police , or Love Food Champions under their official title , will be paid up to £ 8.50 an hour of taxpayers ’ cash .
And if a pilot scheme is successful , the idea could be rolled out across the country , costing the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds .
Employed by a private contractor , the teams will advise householders on how to plan their shopping carefully so that they do not over - cater .
They will also explain the difference between “ best before ” , “ use by ” and “ sell by ” dates , before giving out tips on home composting .
Advice will be given on how to cook with leftovers and how best to use your freezer .
The gold standard was a commitment by participating countries to fix the prices of their domestic currencies in terms of a specified amount of gold .
National money and other forms of money ( bank deposits and notes ) were freely converted into gold at the fixed price .
England adopted a de facto gold standard in 1717 after the master of the mint , Sir Isaac Newton , overvalued the guinea in terms of silver , and formally adopted the gold standard in 1819 .
The United States , though formally on a bimetallic ( gold and silver ) standard , switched to gold de facto in 1834 and de jure in 1900 when Congress passed the Gold Standard Act .
In 1834 , the United States fixed the price of gold at $ 20.67 per ounce , where it remained until 1933 .
Other major countries joined the gold standard in the 1870s .
The period from 1880 to 1914 is known as the classical gold standard .
During that time , the majority of countries adhered ( in varying degrees ) to gold .
It was also a period of unprecedented economic growth with relatively free trade in goods , labor , and capital .
The gold standard broke down during World War I , as major belligerents resorted to inflationary finance , and was briefly reinstated from 1925 to 1931 as the Gold Exchange Standard .
Under this standard , countries could hold gold or dollars or pounds as reserves , except for the United States and the United Kingdom , which held reserves only in gold .
This version broke down in 1931 following Britain ’s departure from gold in the face of massive gold and capital outflows .
In 1933 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt nationalized gold owned by private citizens and abrogated contracts in which payment was specified in gold .
Between 1946 and 1971 , countries operated under the Bretton Woods system .
Under this further modification of the gold standard , most countries settled their international balances in U.S. dollars , but the U.S. government promised to redeem other central banks ’ holdings of dollars for gold at a fixed rate of thirty - five dollars per ounce .
Persistent U.S. balance - of - payments deficits steadily reduced U.S. gold reserves , however , reducing confidence in the ability of the United States to redeem its currency in gold .
Finally , on August 15 , 1971 , President Richard M. Nixon announced that the United States would no longer redeem currency for gold .
This was the final step in abandoning the gold standard .
Widespread dissatisfaction with high inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s brought renewed interest in the gold standard .
Although that interest is not strong today , it seems to strengthen every time inflation moves much above 5 percent .
This makes sense : whatever other problems there were with the gold standard , persistent inflation was not one of them .
Between 1880 and 1914 , the period when the United States was on the “ classical gold standard , ” inflation averaged only 0.1 percent per year .
How the Gold Standard Worked
The gold standard was a domestic standard regulating the quantity and growth rate of a country ’s money supply .
Because new production of gold would add only a small fraction to the accumulated stock , and because the authorities guaranteed free convertibility of gold into nongold money , the gold standard ensured that the money supply , and hence the price level , would not vary much .
But periodic surges in the world ’s gold stock , such as the gold discoveries in Australia and California around 1850 , caused price levels to be very unstable in the short run .
The gold standard was also an international standard determining the value of a country ’s currency in terms of other countries ’ currencies .
Because adherents to the standard maintained a fixed price for gold , rates of exchange between currencies tied to gold were necessarily fixed .
For example , the United States fixed the price of gold at $ 20.67 per ounce , and Britain fixed the price at £ 3 17s.
10 ½ per ounce .
Therefore , the exchange rate between dollars and pounds — the “ par exchange rate ” — necessarily equaled $ 4.867 per pound .
Because exchange rates were fixed , the gold standard caused price levels around the world to move together .
This comovement occurred mainly through an automatic balance - of - payments adjustment process called the price - specie - flow mechanism .
Here is how the mechanism worked .
Suppose that a technological innovation brought about faster real economic growth in the United States .
Because the supply of money ( gold ) essentially was fixed in the short run , U.S. prices fell .
Prices of U.S. exports then fell relative to the prices of imports .
This caused the British to demand more U.S. exports and Americans to demand fewer imports .
A U.S. balance - of - payments surplus was created , causing gold ( specie ) to flow from the United Kingdom to the United States .
The gold inflow increased the U.S. money supply , reversing the initial fall in prices .
In the United Kingdom , the gold outflow reduced the money supply and , hence , lowered the price level .
The net result was balanced prices among countries .
The fixed exchange rate also caused both monetary and nonmonetary ( real ) shocks to be transmitted via flows of gold and capital between countries .
Therefore , a shock in one country affected the domestic money supply , expenditure , price level , and real income in another country .
The California gold discovery in 1848 is an example of a monetary shock .
The newly produced gold increased the U.S. money supply , which then raised domestic expenditures , nominal income , and , ultimately , the price level .
The rise in the domestic price level made U.S. exports more expensive , causing a deficit in the U.S. balance of payments .
For America ’s trading partners , the same forces necessarily produced a balance - of - trade surplus .
The U.S. trade deficit was financed by a gold ( specie ) outflow to its trading partners , reducing the monetary gold stock in the United States .
In the trading partners , the money supply increased , raising domestic expenditures , nominal incomes , and , ultimately , the price level .
Depending on the relative share of the U.S. monetary gold stock in the world total , world prices and income rose .
Although the initial effect of the gold discovery was to increase real output ( because wages and prices did not immediately increase ) , eventually the full effect was on the price level alone .
For the gold standard to work fully , central banks , where they existed , were supposed to play by the “ rules of the game . ”
In other words , they were supposed to raise their discount rates — the interest rate at which the central bank lends money to member banks — to speed a gold inflow , and to lower their discount rates to facilitate a gold outflow .
Thus , if a country was running a balance - of - payments deficit , the rules of the game required it to allow a gold outflow until the ratio of its price level to that of its principal trading partners was restored to the par exchange rate .
The exemplar of central bank behavior was the Bank of England , which played by the rules over much of the period between 1870 and 1914 .
Whenever Great Britain faced a balance - of - payments deficit and the Bank of England saw its gold reserves declining , it raised its “ bank rate ” ( discount rate ) .
By causing other interest rates in the United Kingdom to rise as well , the rise in the bank rate was supposed to cause the holdings of inventories and other investment expenditures to decrease .
These reductions would then cause a reduction in overall domestic spending and a fall in the price level .
At the same time , the rise in the bank rate would stem any short - term capital outflow and attract short - term funds from abroad .
Most other countries on the gold standard — notably France and Belgium — did not follow the rules of the game .
They never allowed interest rates to rise enough to decrease the domestic price level .
Also , many countries frequently broke the rules by “ sterilization ” — shielding the domestic money supply from external disequilibrium by buying or selling domestic securities .
If , for example , France ’s central bank wished to prevent an inflow of gold from increasing the nation ’s money supply , it would sell securities for gold , thus reducing the amount of gold circulating .
Yet the central bankers ’ breaches of the rules must be put into perspective .
Although exchange rates in principal countries frequently deviated from par , governments rarely debased their currencies or otherwise manipulated the gold standard to support domestic economic activity .
Suspension of convertibility in England ( 1797 -1821 , 1914-1925 ) and the United States ( 1862-1879 ) did occur in wartime emergencies .
But , as promised , convertibility at the original parity was resumed after the emergency passed .
These resumptions fortified the credibility of the gold standard rule .
Performance of the Gold Standard
As mentioned , the great virtue of the gold standard was that it assured long - term price stability .
Compare the aforementioned average annual inflation rate of 0.1 percent between 1880 and 1914 with the average of 4.1 percent between 1946 and 2003 .
( The reason for excluding the period from 1914 to 1946 is that it was neither a period of the classical gold standard nor a period during which governments understood how to manage monetary policy . )
But because economies under the gold standard were so vulnerable to real and monetary shocks , prices were highly unstable in the short run .
A measure of short - term price instability is the coefficient of variation — the ratio of the standard deviation of annual percentage changes in the price level to the average annual percentage change .
The higher the coefficient of variation , the greater the short - term instability .
For the United States between 1879 and 1913 , the coefficient was 17.0 , which is quite high .
Between 1946 and 1990 it was only 0.88 .
In the most volatile decade of the gold standard , 1894 - 1904 , the mean inflation rate was 0.36 and the standard deviation was 2.1 , which gives a coefficient of variation of 5.8 ; in the most volatile decade of the more recent period , 1946 - 1956 , the mean inflation rate was 4.0 , the standard deviation was 5.7 , and the coefficient of variation was 1.42 .
Moreover , because the gold standard gives government very little discretion to use monetary policy , economies on the gold standard are less able to avoid or offset either monetary or real shocks .
Real output , therefore , is more variable under the gold standard .
The coefficient of variation for real output was 3.5 between 1879 and 1913 , and only 0.4 between 1946 and 2003 .
Not coincidentally , since the government could not have discretion over monetary policy , unemployment was higher during the gold standard years .
It averaged 6.8 percent in the United States between 1879 and 1913 , and 5.9 percent between 1946 and 2003 .
Finally , any consideration of the pros and cons of the gold standard must include a large negative : the resource cost of producing gold .
Milton Friedman estimated the cost of maintaining a full gold coin standard for the United States in 1960 to be more than 2.5 percent of GNP .
In 2005 , this cost would have been about $ 300 billion .
Conclusion
Although the last vestiges of the gold standard disappeared in 1971 , its appeal is still strong .
Those who oppose giving discretionary powers to the central bank are attracted by the simplicity of its basic rule .
Others view it as an effective anchor for the world price level .
Still others look back longingly to the fixity of exchange rates .
Despite its appeal , however , many of the conditions that made the gold standard so successful vanished in 1914 .
In particular , the importance that governments attach to full employment means that they are unlikely to make maintaining the gold standard link and its corollary , long - run price stability , the primary goal of economic policy .

I 've come across a few news items recently re privacy issues , such as Phorm , and perhaps of more concern , the proposals suggested for government legislation to allow the monitoring of internet traffic .
What can we as individuals do to protect our privacy ?
Peter McCutcheon
Phorm involves rerouting traffic from the ISPs that adopt it .
It appears that in the implementations of the system being considreed by UK ISPs , users will be able to opt out by setting a cookie within the PhormDiscover ( formerly webwise .net ) domain to prevent redirection or by disabling cookies from webwise .
net .
There are also ways to nullify the attempt to use Phorm for advertising purposes , such as the Firephorm add - on for Firefox .
However , some processing will be required to establish the opt-out .
Ultimately , the best choice is to change your ISP to one that does not use Phorm or any similar service .
Another way to avoid Phorm - and to protect your privacy - is to access the internet via an encrypted proxy server .
If your datastream is encrypted , it does n't matter if your ISP uses DPI ( deep packet inspection ) .
A search for secure anonymous browsing will find plenty of services .
It 's about five years since I looked into this area , but the sites I tried at the time , such as Megaproxy and IDzap , are still going .
I found Megaproxy 's paid - for service worked best , but there 's a good list of options at IP Info .
However , bear in mind that , although your ISP wo n't be able to see what you are doing , the firm that decodes your datastream and accesses the net on your behalf can .
It boils down to who you trust .
Anonymous internet services usually set up a " clientless VPN " ( virtual private network ) service that works through the web browser , so check if they also encrypt email .
Lots of businesses now use VPNs for secure access across the net , including the Guardian , so encrypted traffic must be very common .
Anonymous surfing services often make you agree not to use them to do anything illegal , send spam etc .
Some also prevent you from downloading files using automated downloaders .

The no - doubt accurate call on the health of British banks comes from one of their own , Royal Bank of Scotland .
Funny how no US bank is willing to make the same call .
From the Independent :
Britains biggest banks are “ technically insolvent ” , Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday …
Analysts working for RBS , one of several British banks to have received emergency funding from the UK Government last year , told the City that “ the domestic UK banks are technically insolvent on a fully marked - to - market basis ” .
The warning does not mean British banks are about to go bust , because the assessment is purely theoretical , and RBS said the position was “ not unusual at this stage in the economic cycle ” .
However , it will add to pressure on the Government to provide more support for the country ’s banks …
The value of Barclays fell by a quarter in stock market trading yesterday , amid a series of wild rumours about its finances , although the bank said it saw no need to comment on the drop .
City analysts said the bank had been targeted by traders after regulators lifted a ban yesterday on the short selling of financial stocks .
Barclays ’ share price , along with the value of other British banks , was also hit by dismal news from the international markets …
Treasury officials were still discussing plans to help British banks last night but the proposals are likely to include up to £ 100bn of new guarantees for the wholesale markets that underpin mortgage and other loans .
Other possible measures being considered include state support to help Britain ’s largest companies raise their own funds .
Another option is to launch a “ bad bank ” to remove tainted assets from the banks ’ balance sheets , though while this policy is under consideration , it is thought to remain some way off .
Other proposals include ring - fencing the toxic assets within bank balance sheets .
Lord Mandelson , the Business Secretary , has also talked of easing the terms of the Government ’s £ 37bn bank bailout in order to kickstart lending .
Downing Street made it clear yesterday that the Government remained committed to doing “ whatever is necessary to help British businesses and families get through this global financial recession ” .
WASHINGTON –
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni was surprised Friday night by three journalists who shot accusations at her over the fighting in the Gaza Strip .
The incident took place at the Washington Press Club , after Livni signed a cooperation agreement with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice aimed at preventing the smuggling of weapons from Iran to Hamas
Nearing End ?
Livni : Unilateral ceasefire test for Hamas Roni Sofer Cabinet to debate Egyptian initiative by which Israel will declare unilateral ceasefire while forces remain in Gaza ; foreign minister says Hamas must halt all fire , smuggling of arms and return kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit Livni : Unilateral ceasefire test for Hamas
" What , are you like Zimbabwe ? " another woman told the foreign minister .
The journalists took advantage of the opportunity and the stage to read out sections from human rights organizations ' reports on Israel 's conduct during Operation Cast Lead
Livni's bodyguards were on high alert when at a certain stage one person , who did not introduce himself , began accusing Israel of murdering innocent civilians .
The event 's host asked the man to settle for one question , but the latter cried out , " You let her speak here and do n't let as ask questions .
Since when are terrorists accommodated here ? "
In spite of the unpleasant incident , the foreign minister kept cool and reiterated Israel 's traditional stances .
She stressed that Israel had left the Gaza Strip three years ago and was forced to return as part of a military operation .
Livni only lost her peace of mind once , when she was asked by an al - Jazeera reporter if her visit to Washington was part of her election campaign .
" Nonsense , " Livni replied , adding " we work together .
Defense Minister Barak and I are doing the job .
I work according to my commitments as the foreign minister .
We work together with the prime minister to defend Israel 's citizens . "
She is the world 's most famous celebrity photographer , whose portfolio contains some of the most iconic images of the past 30 years , not least the glamorous pictures of Michelle Obama on the latest cover of Vogue .
As such Annie Leibovitz is hardly the kind of person you would normally associate with going to a pawn - broker .
But it seems that in these unusual times even the likes of Leibovitz need to find cash in unusual places .
The photographer has turned to a company called Art Capital that specialises in lending money with fine art as the collateral .
The New York Times disclosed yesterday that Leibovitz has borrowed about $ 15 m ( £ 10 m ) from the firm in two tranches .
Records show she secured the loan partly against property , but also by putting up as collateral the copyright , negatives and contract rights to every photograph she has ever taken or will take in future until the loans are paid off .
Such an exceptional step , involving in essence the pawning of her entire life 's work , may in Leibovitz 's case be explained by the tumultuous few years she has been through .
Her long - time friend Susan Sontag died in 2004 , and she has been in costly litigation over the renovation of some of her properties .
But Leibovitz is part of a wider trend that Art Capital and other specialist lending institutions like it say has intensified since the start of the global economic crisis last autumn .
Wealthy individuals and institutions have increasingly turned to the firm for help – numbers have risen by 30 % to 40 % since before the crash .
" What 's amazing is that individuals and institutions who previously we thought were untouchable are being deeply affected .
People who were truly enormous financially are now scrambling , " said Ian Peck , joint owner of Art Capital .
The numbers tell the story .
Art Capital expects to make about $ 120 m in loans against art this year , up from about $ 80 m in 2008 .
Some of that has gone out to several hedge - fund managers , hit by the Wall Street collapse , who have put up striking contemporary and modern art works .
The company 's offices , which are located next door to the designer Vera Wang 's wedding dress showroom in Madison Avenue , resemble one of New York 's more select art galleries , which to some extent is what it is .
Currently on display are a set of black and white photographs from the 1930s and 40s by the Magnum photographer Ernst Haas , as well as a room full of Old Masters including 17th century works by the French painter Simon Vouet and Francisco de Zurbarán from Spain .
Among the art works that have recently been taken in by the company , and put into secure and climate controlled specialist art warehouses for safekeeping , are pieces by Willem de Kooning , Mark Rothko , Andy Warhol , Henry Moore and even Picasso .
Cash - strapped clients have borrowed money against vintage film posters , antique teddy bears and valuable scientific instruments .
Peck has also witnessed casualties of the recent spate of Ponzi schemes – fraudulent pyramid scams – come pleading for help with art collections as collateral .
But in these most desperate of cases , he said , the company would rarely become involved .
" If someone is at death 's door financially , we can't help them .
Several times a month we see refugees from Ponzi schemes ; their stocks are gone , the money 's gone and they are looking at their hard assets . "
The spike in business to financial firms that lend against art is being reported across the US .
Other prominent artists have also become involved in using their own work to generate funds , including the film director Julian Schnabel .
ArtLoan , a company specialising in this work in San Francisco , told the New York Times its growth in the last year had been " exponential " .
Another New York outlet , Fine Art Finance , deals with clients who can put up art and antiques valued at a minimum of $ 2 m .
It lends up to $ 100 m for up to 20 years .
Firms like ArtLoan and Art Capital typically lend out 40 % of the value of the art works they take in , making most of their profit by charging interest of 6 % to 18 % .
Peck said only about one in 10 of the deals end in default .
" Our aim is to avoid defaulting at all costs .
Given the trouble involved in a default , it 's better karma and business not to . "
Even if the works are not sold , and remain in the client 's ownership awaiting their return in better economic times , Peck admits that this is intensely emotive stuff .
" It 's akin to giving up your home , particularly for people who have built up collections over many years .
People do n't feel emotionally about stocks and bonds , but they certainly do over art . "
In the case of Leibovitz , Peck insists that very few places could have coped with her request for money based on her images .
" We 're pleased to have her as a client and it's a very good fit .
We are one of the few – if not the only – lender who could have valued her body of work ; that 's a fairly esoteric thing to value . "

Unfortunately , there are a lot more of these days coming .
We ’re in the thick of earnings season so such announcements tend to occur when the numbers are provided .
Unless we can have growth in Q1 , we will see the same in April .
I ca n’t speak for the US but in Europe I do see business moving again after a nearly complete shut down late last year .
It ’s not great , but it ’s moving .
As the week progresses there will be more quarterly reports and then the Q4 numbers will be out on Friday and most expect to hear that the US experienced a severe decline in GDP .
Positive future outlooks by the corporate world could help temper the mood ( and negative response on Wall Street ) but even then , it would have to be something special .
The final week of January began with a bloodbath for the job market , as over 71,400 more cuts were announced on Monday alone .
At least six companies from manufacturing and service industries announced cost - cutting initiatives that included slashing thousands of jobs .
More than 200,000 job cuts have been announced so far this year , according to company reports .
Nearly 2.6 million jobs were lost over 2008 , the highest yearly job - loss total since 1945 .
“ It ’s all about the consumer , and the consumer ’s been hit hard , ” said Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics .
“ It ’s a vicious circle as weakness begets layoffs , which beget more spending weakness . ”
A late addition to the Monday cuts include IBM who are cutting 2,800 employees pushing the losses for the day closer to 75,000 .
Miro launches version 2.0
The Participatory Culture Foundation is releasing version 2.0 of its Miro video player today .
The new version features a streamlined UI that looks more professional than previous iterations as well as the option to integrate third party video platforms .
Users can now easily access sites like Joost or Hulu from within the client .
Part of the relaunch is also a completely redesigned homepage as well as a new channel guide
Here 's a video introducing the client and its new features : Readers of this blog might also be interested in the fact that Miro features a built - in Bittorrent client based on the libtorrent library .
I 've always thought that Miro was a great client in concept that was struggling with some technical issues .
I played around with the official preview release to version 2.0 a couple of weeks ago and was positively surprised by the fact that it was actually runnng quite smoothly on older hardware , as I wrote back then for Newteevee.com .
We will see whether that 's enough to actually win over any new users , but there 's definitely a need for an alternative to iTunes when it comes to video podcasts , and Miro 2.0 could be a step in the right direction .
And come to think of it :
Would n't it be quite ironic if a media reform project like Miro would finally become popular because of its integration of a mainstream TV platform like Hulu ?

January Is ‘ Marijuana ’ Month On The Groove Tube
As if this month was not busy enough with the arrival of Barack Obama to the White House and an ever - growing popular buzz about the need for cannabis law reform all over the media and internet , three major MSM outlets are scheduled to broadcast prime time specials examining aspects of cannabis prohibition .
On Friday , January 16 , the venerable NBC news show Dateline has scheduled an hour - long profile of the tragic death of Florida college student Rachel Hoffman .
Ms. Hoffman was arrested with cannabis and unfortunately trusted local police to become an undercover informant , which ultimately led to her murder .
Her shocking death has forced Florida law enforcement to re-examine the use of confidential informants in drug cases and raised the question publicly about decriminalizing cannabis for adult use .
ABC 20/20 correspondent John Stossel ’s investigative unit is going to cast its usually critical eye at government overreach and wasteful spending , this time specifically towards the noted case of medical cannabis provider Charles Lynch .
By all media accounts and advanced in his legal defense , Mr. Lynch was operating a ‘ Main Street ’ medical cannabis dispensary in Santa Barbara , California in compliance with local and state medical cannabis laws .
However , the federal government continues to selectively arrest and prosecute medical cannabis providers under federal laws .
Mr. Lynch ’s appeal for a new trial has been rejected and he now potentially faces a mandatory five - year sentence at an upcoming sentencing hearing .
Depending on the editing process , the story will likely broadcast either Friday the 9th or 16th @ 10 PM ( eastern ) .
Business network CNBC has produced an one - hour special called Marijuana , Inc. to premiere at 9 pm ( eastern ) , January 22 .
Fascinated by the multi-billion untaxed , unregulated cannabis business in the United States , notably on the west coast , producers fanned out to interview cultivators , medical cannabis dispensary owners , middle - class cannabis consumers and of course law enforcement .
Lastly , NORML hears whispers of a major piece about cannabis prohibition being researched for publication at America ’s largest Sunday newspaper circulation drop - in , Parade .

CHICAGO – Despite the city 's first brush with winter , last night some 500 + demonstrators greeted Focus on the Family 's James Dobson outside a downtown hotel , protesting his pivotal role in engineering the defeat of equal marriage rights in California a few days ago .

Dobson 's group gave $ 800,000 for California 's anti-equal marriage rights Proposition 8 , and a Focus on the Family spin - off spearheaded that effort .
Dobson was in town to receive an award from the Museum of Broadcast Communications ( MBC ) , which has been roundly condemned for honoring a man who aims to take away rights from Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender people .
While the demonstration was in solidarity with the massive post-election day protests that have rocked California , controversy over the honor for Dobson had been brewing for months .
Full page signature ads ran in all three of the city 's gay newspapers and there was an avalanche of blogging and other media accounts of the story ( see http://chicago.indymedia.org/newswire/display/84352/index.php for a list of story links ) .
While early on in the controversy a columnist for one of the LGBT newspapers suggested ignoring Dobson , most others in the community pointed out that Dobson 's hate speech – especially when broadcast over 7000 media outlets – leads to heightened anti-gay violence and the loss of rights , as dramatically proven by the passage of Proposition 8 .
Gay activists have long been angry that open bigotry against LGBT people is one of the last remaining " acceptable " versions of hate .
One of the aims of last night 's protest was to send a message to the MBC and any other institution that might contemplate supporting anti-gay haters that our community will no longer be a doormat .
Support for hate will carry with it a very high political price .
Reports from inside the banquet hall indicate that about 125 of the 450 attendees were from Focus on the Family .
Ticket prices started at $ 500 and went up to $ 2000 .
While that represents a huge chunk of change , it comes no where near what the MBC needs .
For several years the Museum has been in serious financial difficulty , without any venue for its exhibits since leaving Chicago 's Cultural Center , and with construction halted on its new multi-million dollar building just a few blocks north of last night 's protest .
A few years ago politicians in Springfield indicated that they might be willing to give the Museum several million dollars , but gay electoral activists say that the award to Dobson has put that off the table .
In addition to the boisterous protest outside , during the reception before the banquet , three gay rights protesters slipped into the banquet hall and began chanting against Dobson before they were hauled away by security .
One of them , Roger Fraser , was charged with Criminal Trespass , a misdemeanor , and was held at the 18th and State Street police station until about 1:30 AM , before being released on an I - bond .
In that context , thanks were given to the many non -gay people who showed up to give solidarity to us on a cold fall night .
Here are corporate media accounts of the protest — http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619/#27631649http://cbs4denver.com/local/james.dobson.focus.2.860219.htmlhttp://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Gay_Activists_Protest_Dobsons_Induction_to_Hall_of_Fame.htmlhttp://www.myfoxchicago.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7822738&version=1&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=VSTY&pageId=1.1.1Group protests Radio Hall of Fame inductionCHICAGO ( WLS ) —
There was a protest Saturday night outside a Chicago hotel by a group opposed to James Dobson 's induction into the Radio Hall of Fame .
Dobson hosts the program " Focus on the Family " and opposes same - sex marriages .
Dobson also supported passage of Proposition 8 in California , which defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman .
The protestors say he uses the airwaves to spread a message of hate and should not be honored .
"
If you advocate the taking away of rights for a whole group of people , you may be a Christian , you may be any number of other things , but one thing you certainly are is you are a hater , and you are a bigot .
James Dobson is a bigot , " said Andy Thayer , Gay Liberation Network .
Dobson received his Hall of Fame award Saturday night at the Renaissance Hotel .
The Radio Hall of Fame is a project of the Museum of Broadcast Communications .
Chairman Bruce Dumont wrote in the Sun-Times that a nominee 's political or religious views are n't taken into consideration by the hall of fame .

Horse - drawn carriages are one of Sark 's few modes of transport Covering one of the most historic elections in the Channel Islands was always going to be different .
As the people of Sark prepare to embrace democracy on Wednesday , with its first elected government for more than four centuries , there were certain early pointers .
Travel arrangements to the tiny island , situated about 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the French coast , gave the first hint with the discovery it was possible to fly to the neighbouring island of Guernsey , but from there the only means of transport was by boat - the following day .
An e-mail from a work colleague at BBC Guernsey provided a few more clues - and raised some nervous flutters - as it offered a list of bicycle hire shops .
There are no cars , no buses and definitely no taxis or black cabs on Sark , so covering the island has to be done on two wheels or two feet .
' Toast rack ' A good torch was the next " must have " - Sark has no street lighting and in mid-December daylight hours are at a premium .
A later e-mail reinforced its importance - a search party had to be sent out for a journalist lost in the dark .
The lack of street lights was not so surprising , however , as the island does not really have an abundance of streets , roads or pavements .
What it has are lanes and paths aplenty , which , when it rains , can become somewhat muddy - thereby explaining why " wellies " or stout walking boots were also required .
Passengers disembarking on Sark from the little ferry are transported to the village in the " toast rack " - a tractor - drawn carrier .
You show me a law that says you can beat your wife and I 'll show you a newer law that calls it assault
Lt Col Reg Guille , Sark seneschal Little appears to have changed since Hellier de Carteret , a Jersey nobleman , was granted a fiefdom ( inherited land ) from Queen Elizabeth I in 1565 .
This gave the seigneur ( Lord ) the right to colonise Sark with 40 families in exchange for guarding the island from pirates .
More than 400 years later , Seigneur Michael Beaumont has retained that right by taking an oath of allegiance to the Queen and by paying the British Crown his annual feudal rent equal to one - twentieth of a knight 's pay - £ 1.79 .
To this day , he and the descendants of the original 40 tenants are theoretically required to keep a musket to defend Sark , although , in reality , Britain is responsible for Sark 's defence .
As head of the island , the seigneur continues to have other privileges dating back for centuries , including the right to be the only person on Sark who is allowed to keep doves and pigeons or an unspayed dog .
There is also a Colombier ( dove cote ) at his 17th Century home , known as the Seigneurie , but Mr Beaumont does not have an unspayed dog .
The island 's leafy paths and lanes have no street lights Frequently asked by inquisitive visitors about Droit de Seigneur ( sleeping with a bride on her wedding night ) , the seigneur 's standard reply is that it would get him into trouble .
Nor , he has said , does he exercise a Sarkee husband 's right to beat his wife with a stick no broader than his finger .
As Lt Col Reg Guille , the seneschal ( senior judge ) pointed out : " You show me a law that says you can beat your wife and I 'll show you a newer law that calls it assault . "
One ancient right all Sarkees can invoke if they believe their property is being threatened is the Clameur de Haro .
By falling to their knees in front of witnesses , they can recite the Lord 's Prayer in French then cry out for justice : " Haro , Haro , Haro !
A mon aide mon Prince , on me fait tort ! "
( Help me , my prince , I have been wronged ) .
If the Clameur is registered with the Greffe ( court ) , the alleged wrong must stop until it is dealt with by the court .
The seneschal said he had dealt with only one Clameur in 1999 , but they almost always involve a boundary dispute .
Unknown future " It 's a very immediate form of justice .
If someone 's putting a wall up where they should n't be , the Clameur stops it , " he said .
The island has a breathtakingly beautiful and unspoilt charm and its inhabitants appear welcoming and friendly - most waving a cheery " hello " to friends and strangers alike as they whizz past on their bicycles .
Services taken for granted on the mainland , including the police , fire service and the government , are mostly done on an unpaid voluntary basis by Sarkees from a sense of responsibility to each other .
To outsiders , Sark 's way of life may be described as quaint , quirky or old - fashioned , but , for the island 's inhabitants , it has suited them very well for nearly 450 years .
Only time will tell whether the historic move to a democratic future on Wednesday might change that .

Israeli atrocities in Gaza : a political impasse and moral collapse
7 January 2009
The premeditated slaughter yesterday of innocent men , women and children sheltering in the UN - run al - Fakhora school in Gaza is a war crime for which the Israeli government and military general staff are directly responsible .
As atrocity piles on atrocity , it is clear that the Israeli military is using Hamas 's rocket attacks as the pretext for terrorising and subjugating the entire Palestinian population .
At least 42 people were killed when Israeli shells struck just outside the school in the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza .
Another 55 were injured — at least five critically .
Witnesses described a scene of horror with victims cut down by shrapnel lying in pools of blood on the street .
Following the attack , a hospital official , Fares Ghanem , told the Associated Press : " I saw a lot of women and children wheeled in .
A lot of wounded were missing limbs and a lot of the dead were in pieces . "
The deliberate character of the attack was underscored by the fact that the school was hit not by a loose bomb dropped from 10,000 feet , but by precisely targetted shells .
John Ging , operations director in Gaza for the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , said that the Israeli army had been given the precise coordinates of the school , which was clearly marked .
Noting the school was located in a built - up area , he said : " Of course it was entirely inevitable if artillery shells landed in that area there would be a high number of casualties . "
Some 350 people were taking refuge at the time inside the school .
The Israeli military issued a statement suggesting its forces had responded to mortar fire coming from the school and that Hamas had once again used civilians as " human shields " — a claim routinely made to justify Israeli Defence Force ( IDF ) atrocities .
UNRWA official Ging denied that Hamas fighters were using its refuges .
" There 's nowhere safe in Gaza .
Everyone here is terrorised and traumatised , " he said .
UN official Maxwell Gaylard demanded an independent investigation , saying those responsible for any breaches of international law must be held accountable .
The Israeli shelling of the al - Fakhora school is no isolated incident .
Ging reported that three Palestinians were killed yesterday in a separate Israeli air strike near another school in the area where no fighting was taking place at the time .
The UNRWA has 23 schools sheltering around 15,000 refugees who have been driven from their homes by the Israeli military .
Yesterday morning a building next to a UN health centre was hit by Israeli fire — injuring 10 people , including seven staff and three patients .
The International Red Cross reported that an ambulance post was also hit , injuring a medical worker .
According to Reuters , at least 75 Palestinian civilians were killed yesterday — indicating a sharp jump in casualties since the Israeli army launched ground operations four days ago .
Eric Fosse , a Norwegian doctor working at the Shifa Hospital in Gaza , told CNN that he had seen more women and children among the casualties on Monday than on any other day since the Israeli offensive began .
Most of the wounded men were also civilians .
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the death toll in Gaza reached 660 yesterday .
Today 's Financial Times reported that at least 115 of the casualties have been children .
Thousands more have been deeply traumatised by the terrifying experience of constant bombing as well as the lack of electricity , running water , food and sanitation .
" Even before the Israeli attacks began , " the article explained , " some 50,000 children were suffering from malnutrition in Gaza , amid the crippling blockade of the territory .
This number ‘ could be increased by thousands , ' warned Isama Damo , who works in Gaza with the human rights group , Save the Children .
Many grocery stores have shut and fresh food such as milk , cheese and fruit is scarce . "
The targetting of the al - Fakhora school exposes the lie used by Israel and its apologists to justify its war against the Palestinian people as an act of " self defence " .
The Israeli army is engaged in a desperate attempt to destroy the capacity of Palestinians to resist in any way their decades - long oppression .
When Israeli officials denounce Hamas as " terrorists " , their vitriol is in reality directed at the million and a half impoverished people crushed into the narrow strip of land known as Gaza .
In a comment in yesterday 's Wall Street Journal , former Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Natan Sharansky denounced the UN for failing to eliminate what he termed the " heart of the problem " — Gaza 's refugee camps of dispossessed Palestinians .
Describing the camps as " the terrorists ' unique system of control " and their schools as " indoctrination centres for martyrdom " , he accused the UNRWA of being " facilitators for the terrorists ' goal of grinding an entire civilian population under their thumb " .
Sharansky 's ravings served to lay bare the fascistic rationale behind Israel 's deliberate targetting of the camps , the UNRWA and the al - Fakhora school .
Yesterday 's attack conformed to a definite modus operandi on the part of the IDF .
In 2006 , the army waged a similar military offensive in southern Lebanon aimed at destroying the Shiite Hezbollah militia and its base of support within the population .
Repeated missile strikes on the town of Qana killed at least 57 residents , including 37 children .
The Israeli military also destroyed a UN monitoring post , forcing the pullout of UN observers who were witnesses to its crimes .
The use of such terrorist measures goes back to the very origins of the Zionist state , when Israeli forces and armed gangs perpetrated atrocities against Palestinian towns and villages as the means of expelling millions of Arabs from Israeli territory .
The long history of terrorist acts directed against Palestinians , including the 1982 massacres at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon , flows inescapably from the reactionary logic of Zionism : the attempt to carve out a Jewish state inevitably involved trampling on the rights of the Palestinian people .
The perspective at the heart of the assault on Gaza 's population was spelled out in a letter written in 2007 by former Sephardi chief rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , calling for the carpet bombing of the entire area .
As reported in the Jerusalem Post , Eliyahu wrote that the population as a whole was morally responsible for failing to halt the rocket attacks on Israeli territory .
His son , also a prominent rabbi , told the newspaper that the Israeli air force had to kill " whatever it takes to make them stop " — a 100 , a 1,000 , 10,000 , 100,000 , even a million .
These comments recall nothing so much as the methods of collective punishment employed by the Nazis during World War II in an effort to end resistance to their rule throughout Europe .
They reflect the complete perplexity in Israeli ruling circles and the political dead - end that has been reached in the Zionist project as a whole .
Israel 's desperate attempt to use overwhelming military force to suppress Palestinian opposition in Gaza can only lead further into the morass .
One can only ask what comes next : the forcible expulsion of all Arabs from Israeli territory ?
The US government 's blocking of a ceasefire has given the green light for the Israeli military to escalate its attacks .
The reaction of the Bush administration to the killing of civilians at the al - Fakhora school was virtually identical to that of Israel .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told the media " not [ to ] jump to conclusions ...
What we know is that Hamas often hides amongst innocents and uses innocents , including children , as human shields . "
The US military has used identical pretexts to justify its own war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan .
While the other imperialist powers , including Britain , France and Germany , have been more discrete about their support for the Israeli war , they too place the onus on Hamas for the conflict , demanding an end to all resistance to the Israeli onslaught as the price of any ceasefire .
The Israelis have also received encouragement from the various bourgeois regimes in the Middle East .
All of them , whether openly backing Israel — in the case of Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Jordon — or feigning support for the Palestinians — Iran and Syria — are seeking to exploit the crisis to pursue their own economic and geo-political aims at the direct expense of the Palestinian masses and the working class of the entire region .
Notwithstanding the universal support by the major powers and in the international media for Israel , world opinion is rapidly turning against the slaughter being carried out in Gaza .
The one - sided war is provoking a wave of revulsion , including among intellectuals and class conscious workers in Israel appalled by the crimes being carried out in their name .
The real ally of the Palestinian people is the international working class — including Arab and Jewish workers — which must be united against the Israeli ruling elite , the bourgeois regimes in the Middle East , and US and world imperialism on the basis of the struggle for a socialist federation of the Middle East .

The Gaza crisis and the perspective of permanent revolution
30 December 2008
Within 24 hours of the death of John Travolta 's 16 - year - old son Jett last week , a new explanation for the tragedy was being put forward by one of America 's most influential media organisations .
The teenager 's death , it suggested , had not been due simply to a seizure suffered by Jett in the Travoltas ' holiday home in the Bahamas , but was the result of neglectful parenting stemming from the Hollywood star 's sexuality and religion .
Alongside a photograph of Travolta kissing Jeff Kathrein , the carer who had discovered Jett 's body , the Gawker story made provocative suggestions as to the nature of their relationship .
The item also referred snidely to Kathrein , who is married to a woman , as a " faux nanny " .
In a boast that seemed to recognise the depths to which it had stooped , the blog observed that the theory it had just outlined was one " you wo n't read about in the trashiest of internet tabloids " .
If this is just another snippet of wildly outrageous internet gossip , the Gawker blog itself – and its ancillary sites – form a media powerhouse that demands to be taken seriously .
Last March , the New York - based company Gawker Media was valued at $ 150 m .
It has been named the world 's most valuable blog operation in a survey by the website 24/7 Wall St and Gawker 's British founder Nick Denton has beaten off bids from the biggest media conglomerates .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
More than any company , Gawker Media has defined the tone of the blogosphere .
Yesterday , its sites were speculating on the health of Michael Jackson and wondering whether he might " moonshuffle off this mortal coil " ; musing on the appointment as surgeon general of CNN's Sanjay Gupta – " What the hell is this , really ? " ; rooting through the Facebook entries of Illinois senator Rod Blagojevich .
Together , the blogs under the Gawker Media banner collectively generate around a quarter of a billion page views per month , outstripping more established news organisation rivals including the Los Angeles Times .
In short , it is required reading for senior figures across the traditional media world , even though they might pretend otherwise .
And it has earned Denton a fortune estimated at £ 140 m and a place in the Sunday Times Rich List .
Five years ago , it was said that London - born Denton , 42 , a former public schoolboy and Financial Times journalist who now lives in Manhattan , might have the nous to " transform blogging from a pastime into an industry " – and he has surely gone on to do just that .
But now there are signs that the Gawker empire , seen by countless businesses around the world as a model for online success , is in trouble .
One title , Consumerist , a popular site set up to give a voice to dissatisfied shoppers , was sold off last month .
Defamer , its Hollywood gossip site , has been put up for sale .
Wonkette , which was set up in 2004 to satirise the political establishment in Washington DC , was sold off last April to the site 's editor , reportedly for a nominal fee .
Two other sites , the travel blog Gridskipper and the Idolator , which carries music news and gossip , were also spun off .
In October , Denton wrote to staff with " some bad news " , laying off 19 of his team , including three of the five writers on the site Valleywag , which reports gossip from Silicon Valley .
Then , in November , Denton himself posted on his own blog a gloomy vision of the future , under the title " Doom - mongering " .
He claimed that predictions of a 16 per cent decline in online display advertising revenues in America this year were overly optimistic .
" From conglomerates to internet ventures , " he wrote , " executives should be planning now on a decline of up to 40 per cent in advertising spending during this cycle ... instead , they 're sleep - walking into economic extinction . "
Denton went on to spell out his survival plan .
" Most websites are still way too small to register with the audience - tracking services that [ advertising ] agencies rely upon .
Of 18 titles launched at Gawker Media , we 've already spun off or shuttered six .
Even now , 91 per cent of advertising revenues come from the top six remaining titles .
Every media group has a similarly lopsided distribution .
It 's time to choose which properties make it aboard the lifeboat . "
The Travolta story is symptomatic of another of Gawker 's ills .
Many believed it had simply gone too far .
" Hey Gawker , Leave the Travoltas Alone , " argued New York magazine , accusing the site of " random mean - spirited speculation " .
Respondents to that article agreed .
" They may have cut off their nose to spite their face this time , " said one .
" Like they 're effing Woodward and Bernstein over there .
A** holes , " said another .
Denton is defiant over the coverage , which suggested that Travolta 's faith in Scientology may have led to Jett being neglected for treatment for a condition identified by some as autism and by the family as Kawasaki syndrome .
A year ago , Denton managed to acquire a cringe - inducing video of an intense Tom Cruise talking about Scientologists as being the " authorities " on conquering drug addiction and on rehabilitating criminals .
Having been posted as an " exclusive " on Gawker with the personal Denton message that " on the scale of scary , this is a 10 " , it generated more than 2.5 m hits .

Of the backlash against Gawker 's Travolta story , Denton tells The Independent : " Gawker brought to public scrutiny Tom Cruise 's crazed Scientology recruitment video ; and we make no apology for identifying the ' nanny ' as a wedding photographer , last snapped himself in a smooch with John Travolta , that other celebrity adherent of the cult . "
Denton had been similarly irreverent towards George Clooney when the actor took issue with " Gawker Stalker " , a feature that encourages readers to spot celebrities so that they can be located on a Google map .
Clooney encouraged his fans to undermine the site by reporting false sightings , claiming that the website was encouraging stalkers .
Denton held firm and thanked the film star for the free publicity .
Gawker Stalker currently features Manhattan sightings of Justin Timberlake , Ricky Gervais and Bill Clinton .
As for " traditional " media critics , such as New York magazine , Denton observes : " If these pompous American magazines and newspapers were n't so busy defending good taste , they might occasionally break a story . "
This comment is classic " Snark " , the language that Gawker was instrumental in creating .
Cutting , cynical , sarcastic and knowing , it is the lingua franca for countless blog sites and celebrity magazines , such as Heat in Britain .
The prevalence and impact of this culture has been recognised by David Denby , film reviewer for New Yorker magazine , in a new book , Snark : It 's Mean , It 's Personal and It 's Ruining Our Conversation .
Criticism by an old - media figure such as Denby , who is 65 , should hardly be damaging to a portfolio of websites that draws its audience overwhelmingly from the advertiser - friendly 16 - 34 demographic .
But more threatening are the question marks about the quality of reporting .
It is no use being cynical and knowing when the readers no longer believe that the blogger is as close to the story as the arch tone of the writing would suggest .
Gawker Media 's first site was Gizmodo , launched in 2002 , when Denton decided to pay a salary to a smart amateur blogger with an inside track on the gadgets industry .
Gawker itself followed four months later , with the talented Elizabeth Spiers nailing the gossip among the New York media set in a dozen posts a day .
Spiers left Gawker in 2006 to set up her own blog network , Dead Horse Media .
Ana Marie Cox , the founding editor of Wonkette , which launched in 2004 , also left in 2006 , going on to join Time magazine .
Other Gawker editors Jessica Coen and Jessie Oxfeld went on to Vanity Fair 's website and New York magazine respectively .
Another former Gawker editor , Emily Gould , wrote a piece for the New York Times magazine last May , in which she described how she had been savaged on the television show Larry King Live by presenter Jimmy Kimmel , who accused her of having previously violated his privacy .
After her appearance on the show , Gould found herself subjected to thousands of derogatory emails , including one that told her " you truly are a cheap , heartless human being " .
Gould later found herself lying on the floor of the Gawker office having panic attacks .
Denton might find it difficult to retain staff because of his insistence on paying writers according to the number of page views they generate .
Maggie Shnayerson , an associate editor of Gawker , was emailed by Denton last year with the following message : " I do n't think you 're suited to the pace of Gawker .
Last month , you got about 400,000 page views ; this month you 're at 160,000 .
You should be doing some 670,000 views a month to justify your advance . "
Denton justifies the flat - rate payment – said to be $ 7.50 per thousand views – on the grounds that it mirrors the way that authors of books are remunerated .
Although an internal Gawker media memo acknowledged that an obsession with page views " can overstate the value of cheap items with superficial appeal but which damage a site 's reputation " , Gould has since said that the system encouraged writers to focus on the most populist issues and to be more " sensational and even more brain candyish than Gawker was to start with " .
Readers began to take notice .
" When do we just start straight - up outsourcing this shit to India ? " commented one , subjecting the site to the sort of snarking which has become its signature .
Meanwhile , Hacker News , a specialist tech website , has refused to take stories from Gawker Media site Valleywag because it claims so many of its posts are " deliberate linkbait " , aimed merely at generating traffic .
Denton himself is unlikely to be too worried by claims that he has gone too far down market .
In his November plan he suggested that commercial media should abandon subjects " such as politics , to which advertisers are adverse " , suggesting that " media groups cannot afford in the current environment to fund their most noble missions ; they should leave that to public - spirited non-profit [ organisations ] . "
His track record demands that his views are taken seriously .
Few have recognised the potential power of the internet like Denton , who says he has spent more than eight hours a day online for most of his adult life .
Having left the FT in 1998 , he made his first fortune from Moreover.com , aggregating stories for specialist sites , and he made another killing from First Tuesday , a networking organisation for internet entrepreneurs .
Then he got in at the start of the blogging revolution .
It 's also the case that Denton has made dark predictions in the past .
In 2006 , he put two of his sites , Sploid and Screenhead , up for sale .
" Better to sober up now , before the end of the party , " he said .
" We are becoming a lot more like a traditional media company .
You launch a site , you have great hopes for it and it does not grow as much as you wanted .
You have to have the discipline to recognise what is n't working . "
Like a traditional media company , Gawker Media has seen key members of staff lured away by rivals , and seen its audience become less willing to allow it to operate by a different set of values .
And like a traditional media company , it is feeling the pain of the violent adver - tising downturn .
In his prophecy of doom , Denton acknowledges that some will regard his warnings as an exercise in " gamesmanship " designed to put off investment by potential rivals .
" My motives are indeed not entirely pure , " he admitted .
Could the founder of Gawker Stalker himself be finally running scared ?

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korean leader Kim Jong - il , thought to be recovering from serious illness , has picked his third and youngest known son to succeed him , a South Korean news report said on Thursday .
Supreme Commander of North Korean People 's Army ( front ) waves as he visits the 2200 military unit to see military training at an undisclosed place in North Korea , in this undated picture released by KCNA November 5 , 2008 .
REUTERS /KCNA
The demise of the 66 - year - old Kim without a clear successor could likely add to the uncertainty of a country trying to develop nuclear weapons but with an economy in ruins and a population constantly on the edge of famine .
The question of succession in the secretive communist state is so closely guarded that no - one outside Kim ’s immediate circle of family and confidants is thought to have any clear knowledge of the situation .
But speculation about his health and the succession is a favorite topic in South Korea .
“ We believe Chairman Kim Jong-il has picked the son Jong - un he had with third and late wife Ko Yong - hui and given instructions to the Workers ’ Party Organization and Guidance Department around January 8 , ” Yonhap news agency quoted an intelligence source as saying .
ANOINTED LEADER
Senior officials of the powerful party apparatus , where Kim himself began his training as anointed leader before succeeding his father in 1994 , have been instructed to pass the message down the ranks , the source was quoted as saying .
South Korea ’s spy agency said despite various reports over the question of succession in the North , nothing has been confirmed .
The Swiss - educated Jong - un is believed to have been born in late 1983 or early 1984 and has been described as his father ’s favorite and an intelligent and thoughtful man .
But his youth has often been cited as a barrier to his rise to power in a society where the tradition of seniority is strong .
Media reports have portrayed Kim ’s eldest son Jong - nam , in his late thirties and seen in file footage as overweight and unkempt , as out of favor .
They say the second , Jong - chol , is considered by his father as too weak to take over power .
Yonhap said Jang Song - taek , Kim ’s brother - in - law and a senior party official would act as the young Kim ’s guardian .
Former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung , who held the first summit meeting with the North ’s leader in 2000 , said on Thursday that one of the three sons was likely to be installed as symbolic leader , with a cabinet of officials from the military and the party forming a collective leadership .
Experts said there have also been no signs to suggest that Kim is losing his grip on power , despite persistent rumors of his ailing health that began when he failed to appear at what was expected to be a triumphal military parade in September .
IN evaluating the causes of the financial crisis , do n’t forget the countless fundamental mistakes made by millions of people who were caught up in the excitement of the real estate bubble , taking on debt they could ill afford .
Many errors in personal finance can be prevented .
But first , people need to understand what they ought to do .
The government ’s various bailout plans need to take this into account  by starting a major program to subsidize personal financial advice for everyone .
A number of government agencies already have begun small - scale financial literacy programs .
For example , the Treasury announced the creation of an Office of Financial Education in 2002 , and President Bush started an Advisory Council on Financial Literacy a year ago .
These initiatives are involved in outreach to schools with suggested curriculums , and online financial tips .
But a much more ambitious effort is needed .
The government programs that are already under way are akin to distributing computer manuals .
But when something goes wrong with a computer , most people need to talk to a real person who can zero in on the problem .
They need an expert to guide them through the repair process , in a way that conveys patience and confidence that the problem can be solved .
The same is certainly true for issues of personal finance .

Within minutes of the BBC revealing the identity of the new Doctor Who on Saturday night , the sniping began about Matt Smith , the actor chosen to step into the Tardis after David Tennant .
The 26 - year - old from Northampton is relatively unknown , his biggest part to date having been in the under - performing BBC2 drama Party Animals .
But on the drwho - online .
co.uk forum , it was Smith 's hair , rather than inexperience , causing the most consternation .
" I 'm happy - as long as he has a haircut before he plays the Doctor , " wrote Brackster .
Other users piled in to agree that a floppy , foppish haircut just was n't right for the Doctor .
Then talk turned to Smith 's youth .
Riben wondered if Smith could be the " first Doctor with an Asbo and a hoodie " .
Sarah Jane Lover grumbled : " I do n't know who he is and I do n't like the look of him , " while Dean 69 was " relieved the choice was not to go for a woman " .
After 7 million people tuned in to the BBC to see Smith crowned the new Doctor , so many fans piled into the biggest Doctor Who website , drwhoforum.com , that it crashed the server .
Smith took up acting after a back injury ended hopes of a football career .
Yesterday his old drama teacher recalled casting him in Twelve Angry Men at Northampton school for boys in 1999 .
" He was n't enthusiastic - he 'd done no acting before - but he got the taste for it and he was absolutely fantastic , " said Jeremy Hardingham .
Smith will begin filming in the summer and takes over as the 11th and youngest Doctor in spring 2010 .
Newswise —
A few years ago , scientists at the University of Idaho discovered birth control pills not only control the human population , but also can devastate rainbow trout populations .
Now they may know why .
James Nagler , professor of biological sciences , recently discovered that 17Î± - ethynylestradiol " an active chemical in birth control pills " causes cells in rainbow trout to have an abnormal number of chromosomes .
This condition , known as aneuploidy , is often found in cancer cells , causes Down 's syndrome in humans , and may be why many embryos fathered by exposed specimens die within three weeks .
The results , coauthored with Kim Brown and Joe Cloud from the University of Idaho , and Irvin Schultz of Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory " Marine Science Laboratory were published in this week 's edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" The bottom line is that aneuploidy is abnormal and highly undesirable , " said Nagler .
" I believe this compound is causing elevated levels of sperm aneuploidy , which in turn is greatly reducing the embryonic survival rate in the fish it affects . "
Nagler exposed male rainbow trout to the chemical and tested their sperm for abnormal chromosome levels .
He then fertilized eggs from unexposed females with the affected semen and compared the resulting offspring 's survival rate with a control group that was not exposed to the synthetic estrogen .
The results showed that while offspring sired by healthy male and female fish enjoyed a three - week survival rate of more than 95 percent , only 40 to 60 percent of the young trout from the affected semen survived .
Additionally , the abnormal chromosomal levels were passed on to some of the offspring .
The chemical 17Î± - ethynylestradiol is a synthetic estrogen commonly used in human birth control pills and is released into the environment through urination .
The compound is difficult to remove in waste treatment plants , and very few plants are capable of removing the chemical before releasing the water back into the environment .
" The concentrations we tested are not found everywhere , " said Nagler .
" But there are definitely many places in the world containing levels close to " if not exceeding " the concentration that we tested . "
There are other synthetic estrogens released into the environment every day besides 17Î± - ethynylestradiol .
Similar chemicals are found everywhere from detergents to pesticides and cause many more problems than chromosome abnormalities .
For example , the pesticide DDT " a weak estrogen " caused the egg shells of bald eagles to be thin and weak , contributing to their declining numbers during the mid-1900s .
Nagler 's research results raise many questions on the levels of synthetic estrogens in surface water across the country and how they might be affecting all animals using the water , including humans .
" Nobody can say that these compounds are the main cause of salmon decline because it's a very complex issue and there are many , many factors involved , " said Nagler .
" But it ca n't help . "

Just checked some money market funds , and for a few of them the expenses are now greater than the yield - so you 'd do better with a mattress .
MarketWatch : Fed to consumers : Hold tight quotes Dean Baker co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research :
" I'm a little surprised [ the Fed ] decided to take it all the way down , it is n't really going to have any substantial impact .
The other reason I was surprised is that it could create an awkward situation for money market funds where they will have to give people negative returns . "
I wonder if the funds will lower their expenses ?
Thousands in scramble for free books after Amazon supplier abandons warehouse
The treasure hunters stand knee - deep in Danielle Steels , Len Deightons and Jeffrey Archers , hoping to find more exotic literary fare .
This is the scene at a huge book warehouse whose contents are being given away after they were abandoned .
Strewn across the floor are thousands of volumes .
Many are a little dog-eared or have yellowing pages .
But since they are free , who 's complaining ?
Thousands of people descended on this warehouse in Bristol for free books after Amazon 's largest supplier of secondhand books left the site
Bibliophiles have travelled from far and wide to the old Bookbarn site on an industrial estate in Brislington , Bristol .
Yesterday , Porsches and BMWs were parked alongside vans outside as the scavengers carried out their finds in crates and on trolleys .
In an endearing display of how the British love the offer of something for nothing , someone had even come with a small trailer on the back of his car .
Others were seen stacking books in prams .
Inside the warehouse , Travis Speedie was crouched in a mound of books , ferreting about and gleefully placing his finds into a large wooden box .
People stood on piles of books in order to rummage through the millions of titles , which were up for grabs
The books ranged from Stephen King novels to other classic and cookery and self - help
Over two hours the 25 - year - old student had already managed to find 20 volumes of Compton 's Encyclopaedia and was now desperate to complete the set .
' I love old books , ' he said .
' It 's a mess in here , real chaos , but it 's so exciting looking through it all .
' It 's like finding treasure when you discover something you want .
' I 've also found a nice , illustrated copy of William Blake 's poems and I want to get some history books too . '
Hazel Gurneet , 61 , a retired PA , had found ' a couple of cratefuls ' of things she fancied , mainly gardening and natural history books , and was coming back for more .
She said : ' It 's an unbelievable site when you walk in here .
Lots of the bookcases have been knocked over and the books are everywhere .
It does n't feel right having to walk over all these wonderful books to find what you want .
But given the cost of new books these days , who 's going to refuse this ? '
Some enthusiasts had queued for hours hoping to grab as many books as they could carry
Bookbarn had been at the site for five years and left millions of titles behind
Nurse Sarah Campbell , 27 , there with her son Daniel , seven months , said : ' It 's a strange situation , but I 've managed to get a carrier bag full of children 's books for my little boy . '
The warehouse , whose lease recently ran out , once contained as many as five million books destined to be sold online .
After the lease expired , he firm running the secondhand book business moved out , leaving it full of books .
Managers of the industrial estate invited people to help themselves so they can free up space at the site .
The warehouse where people are flocking to pick up books
Director of the industrial estate Ashley Nicholson said : ' We asked Bookbarn to clear the books and they got rid of some of them but there is still a huge , huge number inside the warehouse .
' We thought it was a sensible idea to give people the opportunity to come along and choose themselves a book or two and help us clear the warehouse .
' The response has been unbelievable since we opened it to the public .
It 's like a swarm of locusts .
Bookworms came armed with bags and boxes to grab as many titles as they could physically carry
' I 've seen people backing cars and vans into the warehouse so they can stock up .
' One couple even came in a campervan and I think they slept overnight and then crammed as many books as they could into their van and drove off . '
The contents of the aircraft hangar - sized warehouse are a librarian 's worst nightmare , with the books piled willy - nilly and not separated according to subject or genre .
For those with the time to browse , the great giveaway continues next week .

Sixteen minutes after Yahoo announced that CFO Blake Jorgensen was leaving , new CEO Carol Bartz published a post on Yahoo's official blog , titled " Getting our house in order . "
- Carol describes her first six weeks on the job -- " a whirlwind tour for the last six weeks , talking with everybody from executive leaders to the guys who configured my laptop . "
- She talks a little about the new management structure she is rolling out today , that she believes " will make Yahoo !
a lot faster on its feet . "
- That means making things simpler : " We ’ll be able to make speedier decisions , the notorious silos are gone , and we have a renewed focus on the customer . "
- She says smart things about focusing on Yahoo's users -- its most important assets .
" I ’m singularly focused on providing you with awesome products .
Period . "
- She also says she 's going to work more on Yahoo's ( YHOO ) brand .
" Look for this company ’s brand to kick ass again . "
( No details . )
Execution will be key , of course , but this is a good sign that Carol is at least looking to fix the right problems .
The full memo :
A month and a half in the saddle and today I have the perfect excuse to get blogging .
I ’ve been on a whirlwind tour for the last six weeks , talking with everybody from executive leaders to the guys who configured my laptop .
I ’ve been in student mode , slowly getting smarter about what makes this place tick .
And most recently , I ’ve been gathering information on what it ’s going to take to get Yahoo ! to a great place as an organization –- and one that brings you killer products .
People here have impressed the hell out of me .
They ’re smart , dedicated , passionate , driven , and really nice .
There ’s so much great energy and frankly lots of optimism .
But there ’s also plenty that has bogged this company down .
For starters , you ’d be amazed at how complicated some things are here .
So today I ’m rolling out a new management structure that I believe will make Yahoo !
a lot faster on its feet .
For us working at Yahoo ! , it means everything gets simpler .
We ’ll be able to make speedier decisions , the notorious silos are gone , and we have a renewed focus on the customer .
For you using Yahoo !
every day , it will better enable us to deliver products that make you say , “ Wow . ”
I ’ve noticed that a lot of us on the inside do n’t spend enough time looking to the outside .
That ’s why I ’m creating a new Customer Advocacy group .
After getting a lot of angry calls at my office from frustrated customers , I realized we could do a better job of listening to and supporting you .
Our Customer Care team does an incredible job with the amazing number of people who come to them , but they need better resources .
So we ’re investing in that .
After all , you deserve the very best .
We ’re also leaning on this team to make sure we ’re all hearing the voice of our customers ( consumers and advertisers ) .
I ’m singularly focused on providing you with awesome products .
Period .
The kind that get you so excited , you have to tell someone about them .
Whether on your desktop , your mobile device , or even your TV .
And that takes a real understanding of what you want / need / love / hate , how you ’re using our products , and what you find simple , intuitive , easy and fun .
Who wants innovation for innovation ’s sake if it does n’t make your life easier , more efficient , more productive ?
So expect us to hear you better and take better care of you .
Finally , a note about our brand .
It ’s one of our biggest assets .
Mention Yahoo !
practically anywhere in the world , and people yodel .
But in the past few years , we have n’t been as clear in showing the world what the Yahoo ! brand stands for .
We ’re going to change that .
Look for this company ’s brand to kick ass again .
Big thanks to the many of you who ’ve reached out with positive comments .
It ’s clear people want Yahoo ! to succeed .
I ’ll try to pop by here again soon , though probably not too soon .
I have a pretty long to - do list .

Britons flee French island of Guadeloupe as rioters turn on white families
Britons are among thousands of tourists fleeing Guadeloupe after full scale urban warfare erupted on the French Caribbean island .
Trouble broke out on the island earlier last month after protesters began rioting over high prices and low wages .
But the situation escalated this week after protesters began turning on rich white families as they demanded an end to colonial control of the economy .
The troubles come at the height of the holiday season , with thousands of mainly British , French and American tourists on the paradise tropical island .
Guadeloupe descends into full - scale urban warfare after demonstrators riot over low wages and white control of the island 's economy
Violence has escalated on the Caribbean island as protesters turn their attention to rich white families who they blame for their poor standard of living
Protesters were now targeting ' all white people ' , with the media in mainland France describing the situation as virtual civil war ' .
Guadeloupe is a French overseas department ruled directly from Paris , and authorities in France have sent 300 extra riot police to the island in a bid to quell the violence .
Meanwhile , hundreds of protesters are roaming the streets of the capital Point - a - Pitre , looting shops and restaurants , burning cars and vandalising public buildings .
Holiday resorts along the coast have hired extra security to protect tourists , while the airport is jammed with visitors now trying to get out of the country .
Union leader Jacques Bino was the first man to die in the violence when he was caught in crossfire on Tuesday while driving a car near a roadblock manned by armed youths who had opened fire at police .
Six members of the security forces were injured during shoot - outs with the armed youths as they tried to help emergency teams who were trying to save Mr Bino 's life .
Dozens more police and demonstrators have also been hurt in frequent clashes on the capital 's streets - which one newspaper describing it as looking like a battlefield ' .
Protesters ransacked shops and torched cars as the island descends into full - scale urban warfare
Most shops , banks , schools and government offices are now shut in Guadeloupe and the neighbouring French tourist island of Martinique - where protests are also mounting .
Guadeloupe 's socialist opposition leader Malikh Boutih said : ' It is shocking to watch a police force which is almost 100 per cent white confront a population which is 100 per cent black .
' All the same elements of the riots on mainland France in 2005 are present here .
A man holds a photo to pay tribute to Jacques Bino
' We do n't have the same concrete buildings , there are palm trees instead , but it 's the same dead - end , the same " no future " for young people , with joblessness and a feeling of isolation . '
The first protests began a month ago when the left - wing union coalition , the Collective Against Exploitation , demanded a £ 180 a month pay increase for low - wage earners .
President Nicolas
Sarkozy sent his minster for overseas departments to the island to meet with union leaders on response to the demands .
But the racial tensions which have been simmering for decades exploded into full - scale rioting , with colonial descendants who own 90 per cent of the wealth becoming the focus of the violence .
The unrest was further aggravated last week when wealthy white landowner Alain Huyghues - Despointes publicly criticised mixed - race marriages and said he preferred to ' preserve his race ' .
In Paris , the violence has provoked divisions in Mr Sarkozy 's cabinet with black minister Rachida Data acknowledging that Guadeloupe suffered from ' a problem with the distribution of wealth ' .
Laetitia Delaprade , spokeswoman at Voyages Antillais , a Paris - based travel agency that specialises in French Caribbean , said : ' People are scared .
No one wants to go there and those that are there want to get out . '
Tourism Authority chief Madeleine de Grandmaison said : ' Tourism is fragile .
People are not only cancelling this week , but also for all the months of February , March and April .
' We have a huge deficit of tourists ahead of us .
At least 10,000 tourists have cancelled vacations in Martinique and Guadeloupe . '
Authorities struggle to contain the anarchy which has swept across the island

The Paris - based Association of Tour Operators has now classified Guadeloupe as a 'red zone ' , meaning it is not endorsing it as a destination .
A spokesman said : ' Most holidaymakers to Guadeloupe are British , American and mainland French .
' None have been hurt yet but there is the threat of violence in the air and staying there no longer feels comfortable . '
Guadeloupe 's Tourism Committee said that the main airport had also been temporarily closed yesterday because of a lack of worker , but had now reopened .
A spokesman added : ' It is very busy .
Every flight leaving the island is is full . '
Calling Clojure From JRuby
Geplaatst door Michiel de Mare
Clojure is a new functional programming language based on Lisp , running on the JVM .
Even though Clojure is only a year old , there ’s already a book being written about it .
Since this is a Ruby site , and Rails is still the best framework for web - apps regardless of language , I ’ll demonstrate how to call Clojure functions from a JRuby Rails - app .
First an introduction to Clojure :
Clojure is an exciting language for four reasons .
First , even though it ’s a new language , there ’s a vast amount of available libraries since it ’s written for the JVM .
Also , Clojure is not interpreted – it compiles functions directly to JVM bytecode , which means that it ’s very fast .
Thirdly , one of the goals of Clojure is to bring parallel programming to the masses , by supplying abstractions such as persistent datastructures ( immutable , so they can be shared between threads ) , software transactional memory , and agents .
Finally , Clojure is a kind of Lisp , which means that you ’ve got the power of macros .
Macros are functions that run at compile time , and that return code , not data .
Ruby makes generating code possible , but Lisp ( and by extension Clojure ) makes it easy , also removing the runtime performance penalty .

You ’ll need Java , Git and Ant for this tutorial .
Make sure you ’ve got Java 6 – it ’s a lot faster .
Pointto where your Java installation is .
Now pointto your JRuby dir , and addto your path .
I find it safest to call scripts with
To run your existing Rails projects , change the database driver from mysql to jdbcmysql , cd to the rails directory and enter jruby - S mongrel_rails start .

Let 's package our classfiles : cd classes ; jar cf ../../blog.jar . ; cd ..
Now let ’s turn to Clojure .
To run Clojure , you ’ll have to tell Java not only where to find the clojure libraries , but also where your own .clj files and your compiled clojure files are .
Now you can start the interactive Clojurewith this command :
To run a script : Now , let ’s create a class in Clojure , and call it from JRuby .
To compile this , Clojure will want to write the generated class files to the location defined in theglobal variable .
In the , it ’s set to ‘ classes ’ , in scripts it ’s not set at all .
If you ’re in a directory with Blog.clj in nl / rubyenrails , and there ’s a directory “ classes ” , you can compile the file from the
Now we can finally call our code .
Simply require the jar file we ’ve created .
All Java classes are in the Java module – within the Java module , Java package names are converted to ( capitalized ) module names .

By this count , 2009 could easily match 1930 .
The latest data points to 3 pc contraction rate since late last year , with no improvement in sight .

Yesterday put the nail in the coffin of a move from recession ( small “ r ” ) to Depression ( capital “ D ) .
Two pieces of news that were absolutely essential came out – and no , neither one was that we ’ve been in a recession since last year , or that last week ’s stock market rally was yet another sucker rally .
The first was the observation that McDonalds is now the second - largest merchant vendor on credit cards – that is , people are now buying their Big Macs on plastic – in part because they do n’t have the cash .
Credit card balances have risen enormously in the last few weeks , as people attempt to keep going through the holidays :
Commercial bank exposure via the total amount of credit card loans outstanding has risen more in the last 10 weeks than it did in the previous 10 months cobined .
Moreover , the growth in the last 10 weeks — $ 32.3 billion , or roughly $ 600 million per shopping day — represents nominal growth of 9.3 % , or 48.3 % annualized over the last 10 weeks .
According to American Express , delinquencies on credit payments rose to 4.1 % of all credit outstanding in the third quarter , up from 2.5 % in 2007 , with Bank of America ’s rate rising even more steeply – to 5.9 % for the period .
Moreover , the pool of loans deemed uncollectable rose to a high 6.7 % in the third quarter , soaring from 3.6 % last September .
What consumer spending there is has been fueled in part by credit card :
The second - largest merchant - vendor for credit card use is now McDonalds .
This suggests that many consumers are in serious distress if they need to get their $ 4 Big Mac and fries with a credit card .
The second is the news that credit card companies are planning to pull 2 trillion dollars of personal and small business credit lines over the coming months , to reduce their risk :
The credit card is the second key source of consumer liquidity , the first being jobs , the Oppenheimer & Co analyst noted .
“ In other words , we expect available consumer liquidity in the form of credit - card lines to decline by 45 percent . ”
Almost all of the consumer spending we ’ve done in the last few days has been done on credit .
In November and December , retailers see more than 40 % of their annual sales – and since the average American comes out of the holiday season with more than $ 800 in credit card debt , it is safe to say that retailers in general are dependent on an annual payback that is then amortized over mos tof the year in the form of personal credit .
That is , the consumer spending economy , 70 % of our total economic activity , is utterly dependent on consumer credit .
And whether that ’s a good thing or not , the destruction of consumer credit lines will bring about a shift in consumer spending that makes the present economic woes looks petty .
But there ’s more to it than that – Americans have seen real wages decline , and have depended heavily on credit , and as unemployment rises and companies cut benefits , pensions and retirement savings disappear , they will depend on their credit more , not less .
The credit card allows them to even out uneven income streams – and millions of Americans have them .
Either they rely on uneven overtime , on tips , on seasonal boom and bust cycles , or as small business owners and contractors whose payment comes in irregularly .
When unemployment strikes , right or wrong , the expenses go on the credit card .
When hours are cut back or paycuts proposed , the credit card covers the inevitable emergency car repairs or medical bills .
Yes , people should have saved .
Yes , running up credit card debt you are n’t certain you will be able to pay off is dangerous .
But it is also the case that saving has been enormously discouraged , and reliance on credit has become a cultural norm , even a cultural pressure .
Cards poured out like water .
Couples who arrived with a downpayment at a mortgage meeting were told to keep their cash and take out a 100 % loan .
Companies made huge sums of money by persuading ordinary people to put their money in the markets and that growth could never end .
Yes , there is personal responsibility here , but the situation was not of each person ’s personal making , and there is plenty of blame to go around .
In difficult times , the American policy is to rely on credit as a reserve source , as a substitute for savings .
And that reserve is about to be pulled out from under them .
And for the best reasons – the ability to pay is declining rapidly .
Most Americans have no idea how they would pay off their debt in this economy – and my bet is that most of them wo n’t .
Past recessions have been survived by increasing debt and sitting tight until things got better .
Now , we ca n’t increase debt , and we ca n’t sit tight , and it will be a long time before things get better – much longer than most people forsee .
You only have to look at the bank ’s own reasoning here – they are withdrawing their credit lines because they do n’t believe that a boom will come along and allow people to pay off before they are forced to default .
They know that reducing credit on this scale will hurt them too – but their own internal analyses have convinced them that they are in more danger by loaning than they are by not loaning .
Given the huge role of consumer credit in the economy , that ’s one big shift .
What is certain is that without credit , the recession will hit a lot harder , a lot faster than it has .
Personal spending will drop a whole lot more .
People who were getting at least Big Macs will stop having them to eat .
Moreover , with reduced credit lines , people will be forced rapidly to assess their situation – the transition between unemployment and foreclosure , between a bad year and homelessness , between getting by and going hungry , between surviving a medical crisis and being bankrupted by it – will be much , much shorter .
Yes , building up credit card debt has been bad for us .
But it has also functioned to delay our reckoning , to keep marginal participants in the economy going , to keep the economy going even as far as it has been .
And without large open credit lines , life as we know it will shift .
Suddenly , small businesses wo n’t be able to buy inventory on credit – and many of those businesses will close .
Travellers whose balances are near their new , dramatically lowered limit will not travel , because they ca n’t reserve a car , a hotel room or a plane ticket .
People will stop shopping online .
And the kids whose daily meal , tragically enough , was the Big Mac ( and we should remember that one out of every three Americans eats daily in a fast food restaurant ) wo n’t eat .

BUSH AND LAWMAKERS SNEAK A NATIONAL DNA DATABANK INTO EXISTENCE
By NWV News Director , Jim Kouri

While most Americans were bombarded with news coverage regarding the presidential race without end , President George W. Bush almost silently signed a senate bill that would change America forever .
S.1858 allows the federal government to screen the DNA of all newborn babies in the United States .
According to the legislation , the new law must be implemented within 6 months of Bush 's bill signing in April 2008 .
According to police experts , this infant DNA collection is now being carried out by individual states and sample DNA is being submitted to the feds .
Congressman Ron Paul states that this bill is the first step towards the establishment of a national DNA database .
The rational for the Newborn Screening Saves Lives
Act of 2007 is that it represents preparation for any kind of natural or man-made emergency or disaster .
The bill states that the federal government should " continue to carry out , coordinate , and expand research in newborn screening " and " maintain a central clearinghouse of current information on newborn screening ... ensuring that the clearinghouse is available on the Internet and is updated at least quarterly . "
Sections of the bill also make it clear that DNA may be used in laboratory experiments and tests .
DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid , is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms .
Nearly every cell in a person ’s body has the same DNA .
Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus ( where it is called nuclear DNA ) , but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria ( where it is called or mtDNA ) .
The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases : adenine ( A ) , guanine ( G ) , cytosine ( C ) , and thymine ( T ) .
Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases , and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people .
The order , or sequence , of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism , similar to the way in which letters of the alphabet appear in a certain order to form words and sentences .
DNA bases pair up with each other , A with T and C with G , to form units called base pairs .
Each base is also attached to a sugar molecule and a phosphate molecule .
Together , a base , sugar , and phosphate are called a nucleotide .
Nucleotides are arranged in two long strands that form a spiral called a double helix .
The structure of the double helix is somewhat like a ladder , with the base pairs forming the ladder ’s rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules forming the vertical sidepieces of the ladder .

An important property of DNA is that it can replicate , or make copies of itself .
Each strand of DNA in the double helix can serve as a pattern for duplicating the sequence of bases .
This is critical when cells divide because each new cell needs to have an exact copy of the DNA present in the old cell .
The New York State DNA Databank became operational with the first " hit " linking a convicted criminal with DNA evidence from a crime scene .
The Databank is part of a national system called CODIS , a searchable software program with three hierarchical tiers of the DNA Index System ( DIS ) -- local ( LDIS ) , state ( SDIS ) , and national ( NDIS ) .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) serves as the NDIS connection and links New York State with other participating states .
This tiered approach allows individual state and local agencies to operate their respective DNA databases according to applicable state law and local policy .
In New York State there are eight LDIS DNA laboratories .
The State Police Forensic Investigation Center ( FIC ) in Albany serves as a LDIS site for forensic casework performed at the FIC and as the SDIS laboratory for New York State .
All LDIS laboratories maintain a Forensic Index which is comprised of DNA profiles from crime scene evidence submitted by the agencies they serve .
These profiles are routinely compared in order to identify and link criminal incidents that may involve the same perpetrator .
The SDIS database at the State Police FIC contains forensic DNA profiles uploaded by each of the LDIS laboratories and enables inter-comparisons of crime scene evidence DNA profiles among the participating LDIS laboratories in New York State and across the country .
According to a statement released by Texas Congressman Ron Paul , " S. 1858 gives the federal bureaucracy the authority to develop a model newborn screening program .
[ T ] he federal government lacks both the constitutional authority and the competence to develop a newborn screening program adequate for a nation as large and diverse as the United States . ? "
There are also many law - enforcement officials who are uneasy with this centralized databank especially since a newborn has not committed any crime that warrants its DNA sample to be stored by the government .
" It 's one thing for a state such as New York or Oregon to store the DNA of a convicted felon , but it 's entirely inappropriate for the feds to collect DNA from someone who 's never committed a crime , " said a former New York City detective , Sidney Frances .
" I believe the framers of the US Constitution did not intend innocent babies to be treated the same way we treat convicted rapists and killers , " the decorated detective added .
" Even if it 's granted the DNA will be used to help protect children and adults during a medical emergency or disaster , there is no assurance that future administrations wo n't allow the stored DNA samples to be used with more sinister goals , " said another veteran cop in New York .

" While it may be defensible to collect and store the DNA of dangerous human beings , I cannot understand the rationale for collecting such biological material from infants .
I 'm also not comfortable with the fact that the [ DNA ] law was passed without public scrutiny .
Where are the watchdogs in the news media ? " said Officer Edna Aquayo .

NEW YORK , Dec 17 ( Reuters ) - First , the easy part : Time magazine named U.S. President - elect Barack Obama the Person of the Year after he became the first African - American to win the White House .
But the real contest was to make the shortlist .
The runners up were U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Chinese director Zhang Yimou , the man behind the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony .
“ It ’s unlikely that you were surprised to see Obama ’s face on the cover , ” Time said .
“ He has come to dominate the public sphere so completely that it beggars belief to recall that half the people in America had never heard of him two years ago . ”
“ In one of the craziest elections in American history , he overcame a lack of experience , a funny name , two candidates who are political institutions and the racial divide to become the 44th president of the United States . ”
Picking the runners - up must have been a harder job , and the choices ranged from the man charged with tackling the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression to an artist whose work was seen by nearly one - third of the world ’s population .
Paulson “ has come to play a historic role at a historic time , ” the magazine said .
“ A lame - duck president has given him nearly complete control over the country ’s economic policy in the midst of an epic financial collapse . ”
Sarkozy “ has put France on the map , ” Time said .
“ There are times when Nicolas Sarkozy resembles a force of nature rather than a conventional political leader .
He has energy , ideas and vitality in abundance , ” it said , pointing to his handling of the Georgia crisis and the financial crisis .
Time said Palin , the Alaska governor and self - styled hockey mom who was plucked from obscurity to run for vice president on the Republican ticket , had made “ the most astonishing political debut in modern times . ”
“ She ’s fresh , she ’s phony ; an inspiration to women , an insult to them ; the bright future of the Republican Party , the cartoon princess of its populist past , ” it said .
“ She split people then , and they ’re divided still , and she ’s the one subplot in this story that remains utterly unresolved . ”
The name of the final runner up may be less well - known to many , but Time said his creative genius had given the world an unforgettable spectacle in the Olympics opening ceremony .
“ He created arguably the grandest spectacle of the new millennium , ” it said .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Hyundai Motor America is taking aim at Americans ' worries about job security :
If you buy a new Hyundai and lose your job within a year , you can give it back .
" In this uncertain economy , we are looking for ways to reassure shoppers that Hyundai still represents the best value in the auto industry , " said John Krafcik , president and chief executive of Hyundai Motor America , the U.S. arm of the South Korea - based automaker , in a company statement .
" If you find that you cannot make your payment because of a covered life changing event , we 'll allow you to return your vehicle and walk away from your loan obligation - and in most cases we will cover most , if not all of the difference , " the carmaker 's Web site says .
With no extra charge to the sticker price , the program pays the difference between the car 's trade - in value at the time the owner files a claim and any remaining balance on the loan up to a maximum of $ 7,500 .
Hyundai is offering the program because its own market research showed car shoppers were n't attracted by rebates and other more normal incentives , said Joel Ewanick , Hyundai America 's vice president for marketing .
People are simply too worried about making payments no matter how good the deal is , he said .
" Until they saw a change in that , customers just are n't going to buy , " he said .
As defined by Hyundai , life changing events include involuntary job loss , personal bankruptcy if self - employed , getting transferred overseas and accidental death .
The benefit will be given to any qualified Hyundai vehicle buyer or lessee , the carmaker says , regardless of health or employment history .
To get the benefit , the vehicle buyer must have made at least two payments before filing for the benefit , and buyers are responsible for any payments due before filing .
The program is managed by a Walkaway USA , a subsidiary of Dallas - based EFG Companies , which provides finance and insurance products and support services for auto dealers .
" The goal is that this gives the consumer the opportunity to avoid default and maintain their credit rating , " said Jeff Beaver , senior vice president for marketing at EFG Companies .
Walkaway said it has been selling a similar program as an extra-cost product through various auto dealers in Canada since 2000 .
The company recently began offering similar plans in the U.S. , but Hyundai will be the only manufacturer offering the plan nationally .
The program neatly fits the needs of Hyundai 's market said Art Spinella , an analyst with CNW Market Research , and it builds on the 10 - year 100,000 mile warranty that Hyundai began offering in the U.S. in 1998 .
" Hyundai has kind of carved its own niche with warranties and it's been successful with it , " he said .
The program should appeal to Hyundai buyers , according to Spinella , because they tend to have lower household incomes and are more likely to be worried about income loss than buyers of more expensive cars .
Customer value
Since the program is offered on all Hyundai vehicles with no extra charge , it 's impossible to say whether it would really be worth it to consumers , said Peter Sorgenfrei , a New York - based automotive marketing consultant .
It would depend on whether the dealer would have charged less for the vehicle without the protection , but it 's impossible to know how much less .
And given the low odds even in today 's economy , that any given Hyundai buyer would lose his or her income within a year , the protection would n't add much value to the typical consumer , according to Sorgenfrei .
" Not a lot of people are going to take advantage of it , " he said .
Few of those drivers who lose their income , he said , would want to give up a car they would need to find a new job and then commute to it .
But some customers might want to trade in their new Hyundai for a less expensive used car , said EFG 's Beaver , so the program benefits dealers by turning a customer with a financial problem into another potential sale .
While Hyundai will be the only carmaker offering a national program , Walkaway plans to allow auto dealers selling any brand to offer the program , said Beaver .
Regardless of the dealer or the vehicle brand , 12 - month protection plans would always be offered at no extra charge , Beaver said , but customers could also purchase longer - term plans for an extra charge .
Hyundai dealers will soon be able to offer longer coverage at additional cost , said Hyundai 's Ewanick .
But even if it 's never used , Sorgenfrei said , the plan has public relations value :
The program should drive some car shoppers to at least consider a Hyundai and it will make them feel cared for .

Eight hospitals reduced the number of deaths from surgery by more than 40 % by using a checklist that helps doctors and nurses avoid errors , according to a report released online today in the New England Journal of Medicine .
If all hospitals used the same checklist , they could save tens of thousands of lives and $ 20 billion in medical costs each year , says author Atul Gawande , a surgeon and associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health .
ON THE WEB : Read the full ' New England Journal of Medicine ' article VIDEO : WHO shows how to use the checklist
The 19 - point checklist has nothing to do with high technology , Gawande says .
Instead , it focuses on basic safety measures , such as ensuring that patients get antibiotics to prevent infection and requiring that all members of the team introduce themselves .
" An operation involves hundreds of steps with lots of team members , " Gawande says .
" We 're good at making sure we do most of these things most of the time , but we 're not good at doing all of them all of the time . "
In his study , which was funded by the World Health Organization , hospitals reduced their rate of death after surgery from 1.5 % to 0.8 % .
They also trimmed the number of complications from 11 % to 7 % .
The study shows that an operation 's success depends far more on teamwork and clear communication than the brilliance of individual doctors , says co-author Alex Haynes , also of Harvard .
And that 's good news , he says , because it means hospitals everywhere can improve .
BETTER LIFE : Shortage of general surgeons looming Researchers modeled the checklist , which takes only two minutes to go through , after ones used by the aviation industry , which has dramatically reduced the number of crashes in recent years .
Gawande says the checklist may have saved one of his own patients .
Before an operation recently , Gawande told his team that the operation might be longer , bloodier and more complicated than usual .
An anesthesiologist made sure to have an extra supply of blood on hand .
If the team had had to call on the hospital blood bank — and take time to get the right type — the patient could have died , he says .
Safety organizations around the world have pledged to get hospitals on board .
Four countries — the United Kingdom , Ireland , Jordan and the Philippines — already have plans to use the checklist in all operations .
It usually takes 17 years for medical advances to become standard practice , says Joe McCannon , vice president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement , which works with 4,000 American hospitals on improving quality .
He wants the country to move much faster this time by having all U.S. hospitals try the checklist by April 1 .
" Patients deserve it , and they deserve it now , " McCannon says .

Syracuse , NY -- Oneida Ltd. today said it will close its remaining 20 retail outlet stores in North America .
The company that imports and sells flatware to the retail and food service industry said it plans to reopen two stores , in Sherrill and Niagara Falls , Canada , later this year .
Oneida continues to operate its Foodservice , International and Consumer Wholesale divisions , as well as units of its Consumer Direct business , and its European outlet store network .
The company has hired Gordon Brothers Group to manage the closing sales expected to begin Friday and the group 's realty arm DJM Realty to dispose of the store leases .
" Despite the numerous steps we 've taken to streamline and improve the operations of the outlet stores , today 's difficult retail environment leaves us no choice but to exit this business as it continues to be dilutive to our company 's free cash flow and earnings , " said James Joseph , Oneida 's president and chief executive officer .
The company intends to use the money currently allocated to the retail stores to for its global food service initiative , Internet fulfillment business and to pursue worldwide licensing opportunities , he said .
Intel had a little roadmap event today to shed some light on its massive $ 7b fab investment , and the focus was mostly on the upcoming transition to 32nm processors -- highlighted by the first - ever demo of a working 32nm Nehalem - based Westmere chip .
It was just a demo , so there are n't any hard benchmarks available , but eventually the tech will show up in the Calpella platform 's dual - core Clarkdale laptop processors that integrate two processor cores , a graphics core , and a memory controller all in a chip the size of one 45nm quad - core Clarksfield chip .
( Yes , the codenames are confusing as hell . )
Intel would n't lock down the schedule for any of this stuff , but when we asked them about the rumored Calpella delays we heard about this morning we were told that parts of the platform will definitely go into production sometime in 2009 .

Male monarch butterflies have a sixth sense about where their female mates have been .
As New Scientist explains , " [ s ] ensors on the male monarch butterfly 's penis may detect the volume of sperm directly , like the dipstick in a car 's oil tank . "
That is , the male butterflies decide how much of their own sperm to deposit based on the female 's mating history .
If the male senses that the " oil tank " is nearly empty , it will inject a concoction of fertile sperm along with a good amount of fake sperm ( sperm look - alikes with no nuclei ) to discourage future male suitors .
If the tank is already full , the male injects a more potent mixture , with a higher concentration of fertile sperm , in order to compete with the the sperm already in the female .
The ability to assess sperm competition helps the male butterflies hone their reproductive strategy .
As a result , later lovers may actually gain a slight reproductive advantage .
Males of other species are also known to engage in sperm competition .
Some fish species , for example , will release more sperm if there are rivals in sight .
Although sperm competition is most common is promiscuous species , it 's been noted in humans as well .
The " dipstick method , " however , appears to be unique to butterflies , says Michelle Solensky , who conducted the new research published in Animal Behaviour [ subscription required ] .

( CNN ) --
It was a mismatch from the start : a 16 - year - old boy , 5 - feet , 3 - inches tall and 150 pounds , against two reputed Ku Klux Klansmen , the biggest standing 6 - feet , 5 - inches and tipping the scales at 300 pounds .
Jarred Hensley is shown in Klan garb in a photo posted on the Southern Poverty Law Center 's Web site .
Jordan Gruver , an American citizen of Panamanian descent , took a beating that July day in 2006 at the Meade County fair in Brandenberg , Kentucky .
He was called names , spat upon , doused with alcohol , knocked to the ground and punched and kicked .
When the blows stopped , Gruver had a broken jaw and left forearm , two cracked ribs and cuts and bruises .
Now , with the weight of the Southern Poverty Law Center behind him , Gruver is fighting back in a civil courtroom .
Gruver and the center are suing the Imperial Klans of America , and they hope to win damages large enough to put the supremacist group out of business .
An all - white jury -- seven men and seven women -- was chosen Wednesday to hear Gruver 's lawsuit against the Klan and two of its members .
They are identified in court papers as " Imperial Wizard " Ron Edwards , and Jarred R. Hensley , the Ohio Klan 's " Grand Titan . "
Two others -- Joshua Cowles , the Klan 's " Exalted Cyclops , " and Andrew W. Watkins , the Klan 's " Imperial Gothi " and webmaster -- have settled out of court , according to a pretrial brief .
The lawsuit identifies Cowles , Hensley and Watkins as the men who confronted Gruver and insulted him with ethnic epithets while on a recruiting mission at the fair .
Hensley and Watkins , the suit alleges , knocked Gruver to the ground and repeatedly struck and kicked him .
The two men already have gone through the criminal courts , striking plea bargains and serving time in the Kentucky state prison system , according to court documents .
The others were named as defendants because the Montgomery , Alabama - based center identified them as Klan officers at the time .
Opening statements began under tight security .
The center 's co-founder , Morris Dees , alleged that Edwards " sent his agents out on a mission , " adding , " It was while that mission that Jordan was hurt . "

Edwards , who is representing himself , told the jury he would prove he had nothing to do with the attack .
" I 'll prove that I teach them not to go out and commit violence , " he said in his opening statement .
" I 'll prove I did not know they were there . "
He added , " I stay within the law .
I do n't break the law . "
At an earlier court deposition , Edwards demonstrated his contempt for the center and its lawsuit by tattooing a profane reference to it on his freshly shaved head .
Hensley , who lives in Cincinnati , Ohio , told CNN affiliate WAVE on Wednesday that he already has paid a price for something he did n't do .
He said the legal system was " corrupt , " but that he was at the trial " because the law told me . "
He also is representing himself .
Watch what Hensley has to say »
The lawsuit alleges that Edwards , the supremacist group 's founder , uses money from Klan dues , contributions and merchandise sales " as his own personal funds . "
He lives in a trailer on the Klan 's heavily guarded , gated compound in rural Dawson Springs , Kentucky .
The compound is the site of the Klan 's annual white power rally and music festival , know as " Nordic Fest , " according to the suit .
It was at the compound , the suit alleges , that the Klan incited its members to use violence against minorities .
The center is seeking to win a judgment that would allow it to seize up to $ 6 million in assets .
" We want to win justice for Jordan to compensate him for his injuries and put this group out of business , " said center spokesman Booth Gunter .
" We 've won a number of these suits in the past . "
In 2000 , for example , the center won a $ 6.3 million jury verdict that forced Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler to give up the group 's Idaho compound .
In 1987 , a $ 7 million verdict in Mobile , Alabama , targeted the United Klans of America .
Richard Cohen , the law center 's president , said , " The Imperial Klans of America is one of the largest Klan organizations in the country .
It promotes violence and intimidation against racial and ethnic minorities , homosexuals and so - called ' race traitors . '
While on a recruiting mission , members of this organization targeted and viciously beat our client solely because he has brown skin .
" Our lawsuit seeks justice and compensation for the victim of this brutal hate crime .
We also hope that the monetary damages will be sufficient to put the organization out of business and send a strong message to other hate groups and their followers that this type of racial violence will not be tolerated . "
The center says the Imperial Klans of America is the second largest KKK group after the Brotherhood of Klans , based in Marion , Ohio .
Estimates of its total membership vary widely , but the center says it has about 23 chapters in 17 states .
Gunter said Edwards ' son , Steve , runs another group called the Supreme White Alliance , which has ties to two supremacists accused in a plot to don white tuxedos and assassinate Barack Obama .

What happened
Hustler founder Larry Flynt and “ Girls Gone Wild ” creator Joe Francis said they will seek a $ 5 billion federal bailout for the adult - entertainment industry .
Porn DVD sales dropped 22 percent last year , which Flynt attributes to a fall in libido tied to “ economic misery . ”
Francis Koenig , whose porn investment fund gained 50 percent in 2008 , disagrees .
“ You ’ve got 6 billion people on the planet , ” he says , “ and they ’re all horny . ” ( New York Daily News )
What the commentators said
Another day , another bailout request , said Jim Lindgren in The Volokh Conspiracy .
But as absurd as a porn handout would be , “ economically , this request is no more ridiculous than the one last month from the home building industry . ”
After all , we need fewer houses on the market now , not more .
Flynt and Francis “ just might have a stronger argument than the automotive industry , ” too , said Ron Chusid in Liberal Values .
Unlike GM , Ford , and Chrysler , the porn industry 's woes are n't the result of bad management decisions .
Congress probably wo n’t touch this , but it would sure make for interesting viewing on C - SPAN .
It 's a publicity stunt , of course , said Joe Weisenthal in ClusterStock , but seriously , “ if we ’re talking about avoiding systemic economic risk , ” near - bankrupt California really would be hit hard by “ massive unemployment in the San Fernando Valley , ” the nerve center of the “ sin business . ”
Francis actually thinks they could get “ a slice of the bailout pie , ” said Ed Morrissey in Hot Air .
But Flynt , who says a bailout would boost the national libido , sounds like he ’s “ using satire to make a political point . ”
" I ’d say it ’s just another way for taxpayers to get screwed . ”
Porn purveyors may not need a targeted bailout , said Amanda Terkel in Think Progress .
Porn sites and erotic goods saw a 20 - 30 percent upswing after the IRS sent out stimulus checks last year .
In fact , the famously “ recession - proof ” industry might be doing fine now if not for the Bush administration ’s “ aggressive fight in the War on Porn . ”

Groups across the country are taking steps to prevent vote problems from marring the vote next Tuesday .
Every year , both sides of the aisle let fly with allegations of voter fraud , voting machine problems , and improperly purged voters .
Because of technological developments , voters seeking to publicize problems and groups seeking to address them can do so quicker than ever before .
Crying foul in elections is an American tradition .
Instances from recent presidential elections are obvious — belief that Katherine Harris stole Florida in 2000 and Diebold stole Ohio in 2004 persist to this day — but allegations of malfeasance can be found in gubernatorial , Senate , and other downticket races .
This election season , like any other , has seen its share of vote - based accusations .
The Democratic Party has a younger and poorer base than the GOP , meaning that vote suppression tactics that target transitory or low information voters often succeed as a partisan tactic .
In Michigan , the state GOP has been accused of seeking to use foreclosure lists to purge newly homeless voters from the rolls .
In Virginia , a phony flier instructed voters that due to heavy turnout Republicans would vote on Tuesday and Democrats would vote on Wednesday .
In Florida , voters were informed by an unknown caller that they could vote by phone .
In multiple states , college students are being told they cannot vote in the state of their academic institution if their parents claim them as dependents somewhere else .
And of course the community organization ACORN may be , in John McCain ’s words , “ on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history , ” due to its imperfect but wildly successful voter registration drives .
The good news is , voters can use technology to protect the vote .
Unlike in any prior election , everyday citizens have the opportunity to report and research problems via hotline , Twitter , blogs , and wikis .
The most conventional way voters can report a problem is through a voter hotline , of which there are several .
Several television networks host hotlines because they give the networks an early look at voting irregularities that may become major stories .
CNN , for example , is operating 1 - 877 - GOCNN - 08 , which offers to patch a caller through to his or her local voter registrar if necessary .
The voting rights coalition Election Protection is hosting 1 - 866 - OUR -VOTE .
The coalition , which bills itself as the “ largest voter protection and education effort in the nation ’s history , ” has call centers in Washington DC and around the nation .
Staff receiving calls forward legitimate problems to “ tens of thousands ” of volunteers on the ground nationwide , most of whom are lawyers , law students , or otherwise legally trained .
Those volunteers have been instructed to build relationships with local election officials , which they can use to address voting problems before they have the opportunity to swing a local , state , or federal election .
Almost 20,000 reports from concerned citizens have already been posted to Election Protection ’s online database .
Major issues are blogged daily .
Election Protection anticipates hundreds of thousands of calls leading up to and on Election Day .
( Like Google , Election Protection also provides information on early voting , voter ID laws , and voting locations , customized to your location . )
More technologically savvy voters can report problems via Twitter or wiki .
Twitter Vote Report allows users to send a text message to 66937 ( MOZES ) beginning with #votereport or to call 567 - 258 - VOTE to submit a report by touchtone keypad .
Election Protection also has Twitter capability .
An election protection wiki hosted by the Center for Media and Democracy allows users to look up vote purgings and other challenges to voting rights on a state - by - state basis .
VotersUnite.org offers a sortable election problem log .
A voter suppression wiki investigates incidents of disenfranchisement and permits users to add comments .
Reports are already flowing in .
CNN claims it has received 10,000 calls since mid-October .
Election Protection says its hotline has received more than 50,000 since August .
But it can be difficult to assess the reports that come in .
In one typical instance , Mother Jones followed up with a voter complaint — made on our interactive map that allows users to share voting stories , problems , and solutions — that alleged newly registered absentee voters in Manhattan would not receive their ballots in time for election day .
Multiple officials in the Manhattan board of elections assured Mother Jones that they had worked around the clock to make sure every newly registered voter would have the ability to exercise their rights before or on Election Day .
Despite the efforts of voting rights group to shine more light on voting nationwide , America will almost certainly be faced with a thicket of voter fraud and voter intimidation accusations after November 4 , with no clear picture of which are realistic and which are overblown .
The only way this election will not resemble 2000 and 2004 , when Election Day was followed by months of howling , fair and exaggerated , about vote fraud , is for one candidate to win an electoral college victory so decisive that instances of fraud are dwarfed by a seemingly nationwide consensus by American voters .
Technology has made voter education easier and vote oversight stronger , but the only foolproof strategy to avoid vulnerabilities in the vote is to win big .
If that ’s the case , complaints can be examined to improve the quality of future elections , but need n’t be fought over to determine “ who really won . ”

California company to bring more than 200 jobs to Lebanon
Larry Levine is hard at work in a sketchy apartment complex in Canoga Park , a noisy and joyless place with an enclosed courtyard that resembles a prison cellblock .
Upstairs in the back , behind a blanket blocking the light of day , Levine paces his cramped one - bedroom .
Stacks of law books purchased on EBay crowd the floor .
Levine is wearing a Hawaiian shirt stretched across his belly and an L.A. County Sheriff ’s cap .
From his cellphone spills the complicated complaint of a potential client , a man injured in federal prison who believes he was entitled to physical therapy upon release .
“ You know I ’m not a lawyer , right ? ” Levine says .
He then dispenses some free legal advice : “ Have you filed a tort claim ?
You need to find out who is negligent . ”
At a time when no job is safe , Levine is among a small but growing number of consultants who are poised to find work in the economic meltdown as prison life coaches to the perpetrators of Ponzi schemes , mortgage scams and financial swindles .
Advertisement
White - collar criminals have long employed coaches to prep them on what to expect when they trade in their designer clothes for institutional khaki .
Past students include Martha Stewart ( securities fraud ) , Leona Helmsley ( tax evasion ) and financier Ivan Boesky ( insider trading ) .
Now a new crop of consultants is using the Web to democratize this rarefied service , reaching out to small - time hustlers who saw the opportunity of a lifetime and seized it , regardless of the consequences .
Among these self - styled gurus are former prison staffers , disbarred lawyers and self - trained former jailhouse lawyers who ’ve hung their shingles on the outside .
“ We like to use the phrase ‘ jailhouse litigator , ’ ” says Levine , 47 .
“ Jailhouse lawyer sounds cheap . ”

For fees ranging from a few hundred dollars to many thousands , consultants will explain the maze of regulations that govern every minute behind bars .
They ’ll show clients how to file a grievance , obtain a desirable prison job or get transferred to a nicer lockup .
They ’ll tell clients what to say when being evaluated for a substance abuse rehab program that can shave up to a year off a sentence .
Most important , they give newbies a crash course on prison lingo , culture and behavior -- the do ’s and don’ts of a violent place where the wrong move could be their last .
“ It ’s like going to a foreign country and having to learn a new language , ” says Tom Miller , 54 , who did time in a California prison in the 1990s for dealing methamphetamine and now works as a counselor for a San Diego business called Dr. Prison .
“ When I went in , my first cellie was a white supremacist shot - caller named Pinky , ” Miller says .
“ He was absolutely huge .
He had Nazi signs on his toes .
He started talking about some of his crimes and one of them was the rape of another inmate .
. . .
I was absolutely panicked . ”

Miller says the insight he gleaned from Pinky and other encounters gives him the authority to speak about surviving prison unscathed , as he did .
Lesson No. 1 : Stay with your own race .
Do n’t use the phone of a person of another race .
Do n’t play cards with people of another race .
Other lessons :
Do n’t join a gang .
Do n’t divulge too much information about yourself and do n’t lie -- it ’s a sign of disrespect .
Do n’t snitch .
Do n’t become overly chummy with anyone because no one is your friend .
Learn how to anticipate riots and avoid being raped ; owing anyone money or a favor makes one vulnerable .
“ We deal with anybody who has fears , ” Miller says .
“ We also try to prepare people for the family situations they ’ll encounter .
You want to be mindful of your finances .
Most spouses wo n’t be there when you get out .
People always say , ‘ Oh no , she ’s going to stick with me . ’
We tell them , ‘ No , she wo n’t .
So you want to protect your money now . ’ ”

Levine , a gourmand when it comes to serving up expletives , counsels circumspection and extreme politeness .
“ Show ultimate respect .
Be courteous .
People are under a lot of stress in prison , ” he says .
“ Do n’t argue .
Do n’t confront .
. . .
I knew people were lying to me all the time .
. . .
‘ Hey , you want to be Elvis ?
Bigfoot ?
Thank you , Mr. President !’
I did n’t care what or who they wanted to be .
I was just doing my own time . ”
Levine , who deals exclusively with federal cases , calls his program Fedtime 101 .
Its curriculum is based on what he learned during 10 years in federal prisons for drug dealing and securities fraud .
“ Why trust your future with amateurs ? ” says Levine , who founded American Prison Consultants in 2006 after being placed on supervisory release .
“ You get a lot of well - meaning people doing this kind of thing who do n’t know what they ’re talking about .
They lack my experience .
They have n’t lived it .
I teach people what they need to know . ”

Levine is built like a farm silo with a thick salt - and - pepper goatee and cue ball head that give him the bearing of a biker in search of a stomping .
In fact , Levine is the child of upper - middle - class San Fernando Valley parents , a divorced grandfather and Air Force veteran who worked as a cable TV installer and ran a burglar alarm company before becoming an unlicensed private investigator .
“ That ’s when I got into trouble , ” he says .
As are all such stories , Levine ’s is a long one , a recipe of poor choices involving organized crime , counterfeit money and travelers checks , methamphetamine , a friend - turned - snitch who set him up and transactions in parking lots with undercover agents .

“ This guy , ” he says of the informant who rolled over on him , “ built me up as some kind of master criminal ” and claimed Levine had someone killed in Mexico and arranged for the body to be brought to the United States .
“ That ’s ridiculous , ” he says of the allegation , which went nowhere .
“ You kill somebody in Mexico , who ’s going to bring the body back ? ”
Behind bars , Levine ’s fertile mind led him to the law library , where he learned to file grievances through the Bureau of Prisons ’ Administrative Remedy Program , a bureaucratic process he found to be as insufferable as solitary confinement .
He helped fashion a lawsuit brought by dozens of minimum - security inmates over their transfer to a Texas facility that housed gang members and other violent offenders .
As word got around , inmates increasingly hit Levine up for advice .
Some paid him in commodities from the prison canteen .
Advertisement
Now , he accepts only cash .
Levine says he advised 40 paying clients last year , made more than $ 100,000 and has enough work to outsource the review of court documents to a couple of former jailhouse lawyers living in the Philippines .
He rarely meets a client face - to - face ; the mere hint of socializing with a felon might put him back in prison .
He ca n’t help a fair amount of people who contact him .
Some , including the injured former inmate who ’s seeking physical therapy , need real -- not jailhouse -- lawyers .
Others , including a woman whose boyfriend was put away for blasting an ATM from a wall , are simply delusional .
“ This lady had it in her mind that this dude was set up .
They had it on camera ! ”
Levine says incredulously .
“ I get people who are going away for child pornography .
I do n’t want to deal with them .
What I tell them is : ‘ Pray .
You ’re going to get beat up every day you ’re in there . ’ ”
Clients he takes on get a guarantee unique in American commerce .

“ If they ask , how do I know I can trust you , I tell them : ‘ You do n’t , ’ ” he says .
“ I can steal your money .
But all you have to do is tell my probation officer .
Think I ’m going back to prison for a couple thousand dollars ?
That ’s your insurance policy . ”
That was good enough for Chris Upchurch , a 33 - year - old Idaho home builder indicted last year in a mortgage fraud and kickback scheme that used straw borrowers with falsified income and credit histories to obtain $ 20 million in bogus construction loans .
“ Crud , a guy like that -- he ’s got experience , ” Upchurch says .
Months before he was arrested , Upchurch felt the FBI closing in .
He Googled “ prison time ” and “ help ” and up popped Levine ’s website , www.americanprisonconsultants .com .
It includes his resume -- a list of the prisons he served time in -- and testimonials from inmate - clients .

Levine tells it like it is .
. . .
A virtual encyclopedia of BOP policy and procedure .
. . .
Two thumbs up for Levine !
Upchurch , charged with 20 counts of bank fraud , faced 30 years in prison .
One of the four lawyers he ’s gone through advised him to plead not guilty and have a jury decide his fate .
Levine ’s advice : “ Do n’t be stupid .
They ’re going to get you . ”
More than 90 % of federal defendants plead guilty ; the vast majority who go to trial are convicted ; four of five convicted defendants serve jail time .
It ’s better to make a deal .
Eventually , Upchurch pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud .
He ’s hoping to get no more than 3 1/ 2 years when he is sentenced next month .

Upchurch believes he got his money ’s worth from the $ 1,500 Levine charged .
Levine told him about the substance abuse program .
( “ I drink a lot more now .
It ’s been a tough year , ” Upchurch says . )
And he listened to Upchurch ’s concerns about his three young children and his wife , who is expecting another .
“ She ’s a big - time Christian girl and does n’t like what happened , ” Upchurch says .
Upchurch took comfort in Levine ’s advice .
The soon - to - be con looked to the ex-con as a Padawan would a Jedi Master .
“ If you ’re getting divorced , you call a friend who ’s been divorced , ” Upchurch says .

Such nurturing takes time -- and trust .
On Levine ’s end , that means a signed service agreement and payment upfront .
“ They ’re criminals .
I do n’t trust these people , ” he says .
On a speaker phone now , Levine is talking to a woman whose daughter is serving 10 years for a drug conviction .
He explains that for $ 1,000 he will review the case looking for grounds to file a 2255 habeas corpus motion , a common sentence - reduction tool used by inmates .
The woman asks a lot of questions .
She wonders aloud whether her phone is being tapped .

“ Let me do my job ! ” Levine shouts .
“ Do n’t second - guess what I ’m doing ! ”
A few hours later $ 1,000 hits Levine ’s bank account and a peculiar wheel of justice begins to turn .

Top 10 Most Expensive Accidents in History
Throughout history , humans have always been prone to accidents .
Do n't forget to Subscribe to our FREE newsletter so you never miss out on any spectacular exotic car wrecks
Enter Email
Some , such as the exotic car crashes seen on this page , can be very expensive .
But that 's trivial compared to the truly expensive accidents .
An accident is defined as " an undesirable or unfortunate happening that occurs unintentionally and usually results in harm , injury , damage , or loss " .
Our aim is to list the top 10 most expensive accidents in the history of the world as measured in dollars .
This includes property damage and expenses incurred related to the accident such as cleanup and industry losses .
Many of these accidents involve casualties which obviously cannot be measured in dollar terms .
Each life lost is priceless and is not factored into the equation .
Deliberate actions such as war or terrorism and natural disasters do not qualify as accidents and therefore are not included in this list .
$ 150 Million # 10 .
Titanic
The sinking of the Titanic is possibly the most famous accident in the world .
But it barely makes our list of top 10 most expensive .
On April 15 , 1912 , the Titanic sank on its maiden voyage and was considered to be the most luxurious ocean liner ever built .
Over 1,500 people lost their lives when the ship ran into an iceberg and sunk in frigid waters .
The ship cost $ 7 million to build ( $ 150 million in today 's dollars ) .
$ 358 Million # 9 . Tanker Truck vs Bridge
On August 26 , 2004 , a car collided with a tanker truck containing 32,000 liters of fuel on the Wiehltal Bridge in Germany .
The tanker crashed through the guardrail and fell 90 feet off the A4 Autobahn resulting in a huge explosion and fire which destroyed the load - bearing ability of the bridge .
Temporary repairs cost $ 40 million and the cost to replace the bridge is estimated at $ 318 Million .
$ 500 Million # 8 . MetroLink Crash
On September 12 , 2008 , in what was one of the worst train crashes in California history , 25 people were killed when a Metrolink commuter train crashed head - on into a Union Pacific freight train in Los Angeles .
It is thought that the Metrolink train may have run through a red signal while the conductor was busy text messaging .
Wrongful death lawsuits are expected to cause $ 500 million in losses for Metrolink .
$ 1.4 Billion # 7 . B - 2 Bomber Crash
Here we have our first billion dollar accident ( and we 're only # 7 on the list ) .
This B - 2 stealth bomber crashed shortly after taking off from an air base in Guam on February 23 , 2008 .
Investigators blamed distorted data in the flight control computers caused by moisture in the system .
This resulted in the aircraft making a sudden nose - up move which made the B - 2 stall and crash .
This was 1 of only 21 ever built and was the most expensive aviation accident in history .
Both pilots were able to eject to safety .
The crash was captured on video .
It shows one B - 2 Bomber successfully taking off followed by the B - 2 Bomber which crashes .
The crash starts at 2:00
$ 2.5 Billion # 6 . Exxon Valdez
The Exxon Valdez oil spill was not a large one in relation to the world 's biggest oil spills , but it was a costly one due to the remote location of Prince William Sound ( accessible only by helicopter and boat ) .
On March 24 , 1989 , 10.8 million gallons of oil was spilled when the ship 's master , Joseph Hazelwood , left the controls and the ship crashed into a Reef .
The cleanup cost Exxon $ 2.5 billion .
$ 3.4 Billion # 5 . Piper Alpha Oil Rig
The world 's worst off - shore oil disaster .
At one time , it was the world 's single largest oil producer , spewing out 317,000 barrels of oil per day .
On July 6 , 1988 , as part of routine maintenance , technicians removed and checked safety valves which were essential in preventing dangerous build - up of liquid gas .
There were 100 identical safety valves which were checked .
Unfortunately , the technicians made a mistake and forgot to replace one of them .
At 10 PM that same night , a technician pressed a start button for the liquid gas pumps and the world 's most expensive oil rig accident was set in motion .
Within 2 hours , the 300 foot platform was engulfed in flames .
It eventually collapsed , killing 167 workers and resulting in $ 3.4 Billion in damages .
$ 5.5 Billion # 4 . Challenger Explosion
The Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed 73 seconds after takeoff due on January 28 , 1986 due to a faulty O-ring .
It failed to seal one of the joints , allowing pressurized gas to reach the outside .
This in turn caused the external tank to dump its payload of liquid hydrogen causing a massive explosion .
The cost of replacing the Space Shuttle was $ 2 billion in 1986 ( $ 4.5 billion in today 's dollars ) .
The cost of investigation , problem correction , and replacement of lost equipment cost $ 450 million from 1986 - 1987 ( $ 1 Billion in today 's dollars ) .
$ 12 Billion # 3 . Prestige Oil Spill
On November 13 , 2002 , the Prestige oil tanker was carrying 77,000 tons of heavy fuel oil when one of its twelve tanks burst during a storm off Galicia , Spain .
Fearing that the ship would sink , the captain called for help from Spanish rescue workers , expecting them to take the ship into harbour .
However , pressure from local authorities forced the captain to steer the ship away from the coast .
The captain tried to get help from the French and Portuguese authorities , but they too ordered the ship away from their shores .
The storm eventually took its toll on the ship resulting in the tanker splitting in half and releasing 20 million gallons oil into the sea .
According to a report by the Pontevedra Economist Board , the total cleanup cost $ 12 billion .
$ 13 Billion # 2 . Space Shuttle Columbia
The Space Shuttle Columbia was the first space worthy shuttle in NASA 's orbital fleet .
It was destroyed during re-entry over Texas on February 1 , 2003 after a hole was punctured in one of the wings during launch 16 days earlier .
The original cost of the shuttle was $ 2 Billion in 1978 .
That comes out to $ 6.3 Billion in today 's dollars .
$ 500 million was spent on the investigation , making it the costliest aircraft accident investigation in history .
The search and recovery of debris cost $ 300 million .
In the end , the total cost of the accident ( not including replacement of the shuttle ) came out to $ 13 Billion according to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics .
$ 200 Billion # 1 . Chernobyl
On April 26 , 1986 , the world witnessed the costliest accident in history .
The Chernobyl disaster has been called the biggest socio-economic catastrophe in peacetime history .
50 % of the area of Ukraine is in some way contaminated .
Over 200,000 people had to be evacuated and resettled while 1.7 million people were directly affected by the disaster .
The death toll attributed to Chernobyl , including people who died from cancer years later , is estimated at 125,000 .
The total costs including cleanup , resettlement , and compensation to victims has been estimated to be roughly $ 200 Billion .
The cost of a new steel shelter for the Chernobyl nuclear plant will cost $ 2 billion alone .
The accident was officially attributed to power plant operators who violated plant procedures and were ignorant of the safety requirements needed .

PUEBLO , Colorado ( CNN ) -- Orphan Train rider Stanley Cornell 's oldest memory is of his mother 's death in 1925 .
Stanley Cornell , right , and his younger brother , Victor , were adopted from an " Orphan Train . " more photos »
" My first feeling was standing by my mom 's bedside when she was dying .
She died of tuberculosis , " recalls Cornell .
" I remember her crying , holding my hand , saying to ' be good to Daddy . ' "
" That was the last I saw of her .
I was probably four , " Cornell says of his mother , Lottie Cornell , who passed away in Elmira , New York .
His father , Floyd Cornell , was still suffering the effects of nerve gas and shell shock after serving as a soldier in combat during WWI .
That made it difficult for him to keep steady work or care for his two boys .
" Daddy Floyd , " as Stanley Cornell calls his birth father , eventually contacted the Children 's Aid Society .
The society workers showed up in a big car with candy and whisked away Stanley and his brother , Victor , who was 16 months younger .
See the Cornell family album »
Stanley Cornell remembers his father was crying and hanging on to a post .
The little boy had a feeling he would not see his father again .
The two youngsters were taken to an orphanage , the Children 's Aid Society of New York , founded by social reformer Charles Loring Brace
" It was kind of rough in the orphans ' home , " Cornell remembers , adding that the older children preyed on the younger kids -- even though officials tried to keep them separated by chicken wire fences .
He says he remembers being beaten with whips like those used on horses .
New York City in 1926 was teeming with tens of thousands of homeless and orphaned children .
These so - called " street urchins " resorted to begging , stealing or forming gangs to commit violence to survive .
Some children worked in factories and slept in doorways or flophouses .
The Orphan Train movement took Stanley Cornell and his brother out of the city during the last part of a mass relocation movement for children called " placing out .
" Watch Cornell share ups and downs of his family story
Brace 's agency took destitute children , in small groups , by train to small towns and farms across the country , with many traveling to the West and Midwest .
From 1854 to 1929 , more than 200,000 children were placed with families across 47 states .
It was the beginning of documented foster care in America .
" It 's an exodus , I guess .
They called it Orphan Train riders that rode the trains looking for mom and dad like my brother and I . "
" We 'd pull into a train station , stand outside the coaches dressed in our best clothes .
People would inspect us like cattle farmers .
And if they did n't choose you , you 'd get back on the train and do it all over again at the next stop . "
Cornell and his brother were " placed out " twice with their aunts in Pennsylvania and Coffeyville , Kansas .
But their placements did n't last and they were returned to the Children 's Aid Society .
" Then they made up another train .
Sent us out West .
A hundred - fifty kids on a train to Wellington , Texas , " Cornell recalls .
" That 's where Dad happened to be in town that day . "
Each time an Orphan Train was sent out , adoption ads were placed in local papers before the arrival of the children .
J.L. Deger , a 45 - year - old farmer , knew he wanted a boy even though he already had two daughters ages 10 and 13 .
" He 'd just bought a Model T. Mr. Deger looked those boys over .
We were the last boys holding hands in a blizzard , December 10 , 1926 , " Cornell remembers .
He says that day he and his brother stood in a hotel lobby .
" He asked us if we wanted to move out to farm with chickens , pigs and a room all to your own .
He only wanted to take one of us , decided to take both of us . "
Life on the farm was hard work .
" I did have to work and I expected it , because they fed me , clothed me , loved me .
We had a good home .
I 'm very grateful .
Always have been , always will be . "
Taking care of a family was n't always easy .
" In 1931 , the Dust Bowl days started .
The wind never quit .
Sixty , 70 miles an hour , all that dust .
It was a mess .
Sometimes , Dad would n't raise a crop in two years . "
A good crop came in 1940 .
With his profit in hand , " first thing Dad did was he took that money and said , ' we 're going to repay the banker for trusting us , ' " Cornell says .
When World War II began , Cornell joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps .
He shipped out to Africa and landed near Casablanca , Morocco , where he laid telephone and teletype lines .
Later he served in Egypt and northern Sicily .
While in Italy , he witnessed Mount Vesuvius erupting .
It was on a telephone line - laying mission between Naples and Rome that Cornell suffered his first of three wounds .
" Our jeep was hit by a bomb .
I thought I was in the middle of the ocean .
It was the middle of January and I was in a sea of mud . "
With their jeep destroyed and Cornell bleeding from a head wound , his driver asked a French soldier to use his vehicle to transport them .
The Frenchman refused to drive Cornell the five miles to the medical unit .
" So , the driver pulled out his pistol , put the gun to the French soldier 's head and yelled , ' tout suite ! ' or ' move it ! ' " Cornell recalls .
Once he was treated , Cornell remembers the doctor saying , " You 've got 30 stitches in your scalp .
An eighth of an inch deeper and you'd be dead . "
Cornell always refused to accept his commendations for a Purple Heart even though he'd been wounded three times , twice severely enough to be hospitalized for weeks .
He felt the medals were handed out too often to troops who suffered the equivalent of a scratch .
His younger brother served during the war in the Air Force at a base in Nebraska , where he ran a film projector at the officers ' club .
As WWII was drawing to a close , Stanley Cornell headed up the teletype section at Allied headquarters in Reims , France .
" I saw [ Gen. Dwight ]
Eisenhower every day , " he recalls .
On May 7 , 1945 , the Nazis surrendered .
" I sent the first teletype message from Eisenhower saying the war was over with Germany , " Cornell says .
In 1946 , the 25 - year - old Stanley Cornell met with his 53 - year - old birth father , Daddy Floyd .
It was the last time they would see each other .
Cornell eventually got married and he and his wife , Earleen , adopted two boys , Dana and Dennis , when each was just four weeks old .
" I knew what it was like to grow up without parents , " Cornell says .
" We were married seven years and could n't have kids , so I asked my wife , ' how about adoption ? '
She 'd heard my story before and said , ' OK . ' "
After they adopted their two boys , Earleen gave birth to a girl , Denyse .
Dana Cornell understands what his father and uncle went through .
" I do n't think [ Uncle ] Vic and Stan could have been better parents .
I can relate , you know , because Dad adopted Dennis and me .
He has taught me an awful lot over the years , " Dana Cornell says .
Dana Cornell says his adoptive parents have always said that if the boys wanted to find their birth parents , they would help .
But he decided not to because of how he feels about the couple who adopted him .
" They are my parents and that 's the way it 's gonna be . "
Stanley and Earleen Cornell have been married 61 years .
She is a minister at a church in Pueblo , Colorado , and is the cook at her son 's restaurant , Dana 's Lil ' Kitchen .
Stanley Cornell believes he is one of only 15 surviving Orphan Train children .
His brother , Victor Cornell , a retired movie theater chain owner , is also alive and living in Moscow , Idaho .

Clear Channel has offered to upgrade the “ Amber Alert ” signs around California .
Not because Clear Channel cares about kidnapped children , ( Clear Channel rightly hates kids ) but because they want a new place to put ads .
Currently , the “ Amber Alert ” displays look like giant Casio calculators .
The upgraded ones will be more like those annoying electronic billboards from Blade Runner that are increasingly blighting Los Angeles and other major cities .
When kids are n’t being kidnapped , Clear Channel will run ads on the signs .
When the kids do get kidnapped , the signs will let you know .
So California gets some upgraded signs and revenue from ads .
Clear Channel gets to put giant , distracting billboards right above the highway - billboards targeting the type of consumer who wants to stop the kidnap / murder of kids .
Not that this will help kidnapped children .
Like many Californians , I ’ve trained myself to ignore advertisements .
Sandwiched between ads , messages like “ Save Kidnapped Maria ” will pass out of my mind as quickly as suggestions that I buy Vagisil or watch “ The Closer . ”
So drivers will be put in danger from distraction , advertisements will encroach even more into our lives , and kidnapped children will be less safe .
On the other hand , they ’ll have more money to fix potholes , so I say we go for it .
But why stop there ?
In these tough economic times , we should n’t just mortgage our children ’s safety .
We should be brave enough
So drivers will be put in danger from distraction , advertisements will encroach even more into our lives , and kidnapped children will be less safe .
On the other hand , they ’ll have more money to fix potholes , so I say we go for it .
But why stop there ?
In these tough economic times , we should n’t just mortgage our children ’s safety .
We should be brave enough to mortgage our own .
Why not upgrade our 911 system with a generous grant from T - Mobile ?
People will be fine listening to a fifteen second ad before they report their stab wound .
Get the meter maids to hand out Thai restaurant menus .
How about some ads on the sides of our Ambulances for Virginia Slims ?
We got a budget hole to fill .
Now lets get Advil to sponsor our police beatings .
Can a $ 400 - million injection of federal bailout money to the “ bank to the stars ” in Beverly Hills really help revive the troubled U.S. economy ?
That ’s one of the questions the Treasury Department ’s inspector general is asking in a review of the decision to award bailout funds to City National Bank , The Times has learned .
The inspector general ’s examination of the funding for City National reflects growing concern in Washington about whether the banking bailout is working .
In a private meeting Dec. 10 , top financial regulators , including Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson , acknowledged the difficulty of keeping track of the massive funding and measuring its effects on the economy , according to documents released Wednesday .
The inquiry is not based on any suspected wrongdoing by City National .
Instead , investigators see the review as a case study into how the Treasury Department is implementing its controversial program to infuse $ 250 billion into the nation ’s banking system and why certain institutions were selected to participate .
Advertisement
The program was launched at the peak of the financial crisis in October to strengthen banks and encourage them to lend money , thawing the freeze that has deepened the yearlong recession .
But critics are questioning the effectiveness of the effort and whether bureaucrats can ensure that the money will actually be used to make loans .
So far , the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Oversight Panel for Economic Stabilization have issued reports skeptical of the ability of the program to help the general economy and critical of the Treasury Department for not publicly explaining how it doles out taxpayer funds .
The new inquiry by Treasury Department Inspector General Eric Thorson takes a more focused examination of a single firm -- City National .
The Beverly Hills institution is among 209 banks that have so far received a total of $ 162 billion in bailout money .
In a statement to The Times , the inspector general ’s office said it wanted to know “ specifically how financial institutions are determined to be eligible for participation ” and that it was “ looking at the application and selection of one institution based in Southern California . ”
Advertisement
The statement , issued by Richard Delmar , counsel to the inspector general , did not name the bank .
But City National was identified as the target of the inquiry in briefings on Capitol Hill last month , according to congressional officials who were not authorized to discuss the matter .
With more than $ 12 billion in deposits , City National is the largest bank based in Los Angeles County .
It has long been known as the “ bank to the stars ” because it provides wealth - management services for entertainment industry figures .
About 19 % of its commercial loans go to the industry .
City National has said it was encouraged to apply for the bailout funds ( which was first reported in late October as $ 395 million ) and that there was no indication that it did anything wrong in seeking the money .
When the bank announced that it would get the funds , Chief Executive Russell Goldsmith said it would create a “ fortress balance sheet that will reassure our clients and attract new clients . ”

The inquiry has caught bank officials by surprise .
“ We ’re not aware of any such review , ” spokeswoman Debora Vrana said .
“ As we ’ve said before , the Treasury Department invested $ 400 million in City National as part of a broader plan to inject capital into some of the nation ’s strongest financial institutions .
This investment is a vote of confidence in City National . ”
But experts outside the Bush administration are uncertain that the cash injections are helping the economy .
The $ 250 - billion banking bailout is the largest component of the $ 700 - billion federal Troubled Asset Relief Program .
Richard H. Neiman , superintendent of banks for the state of New York and a member of the Congressional Oversight Panel that is probing the bailout , said nobody knew yet whether banks were hoarding the capital or using it to make loans .
Advertisement
A tension exists in the system now because banks fear the consequences of making bad loans in a recession , even while they are getting federal money and being exhorted to expand lending , Neiman said .
“ It was a missed opportunity for the Treasury not to impose greater criteria and expectations to those banks receiving the funds , as well as greater reporting requirements to understand how the funds are being used , ” he said .
It is also questionable whether the massive program is helping local communities .
In mid-December , bankers , economists and business leaders in hard - hit Las Vegas told a hearing of the Congressional Oversight Panel that they had not seen any positive effect .
Treasury officials , however , have contended from the start that the program is intended to make healthy banks healthier .

“ Our purpose is to increase confidence in our banks and increase the confidence of our banks , so that they will deploy , not horde their capital , ” Secretary Paulson said in announcing the program Oct. 20 .
Since then , Treasury officials have pleaded for patience to allow the plan time to unfold .
The Treasury Department process for awarding the funds , however , seems opaque .
Banks applying for the funds -- in some cases billions of dollars -- have only to fill out a two - page form .
Each bank request goes to the regulator for that segment of the industry , such as the Office of Thrift Supervision for savings and loans .
A recommendation then goes to the Treasury Department ’s Office of Financial Stabilization , and a closed - door committee decides who gets money .
The 209 banks that have received funds are a tiny fraction of the roughly 8,000 banks in the nation .
Regulators have declined to say how many applications have been filed or the percentage that has been approved .
Advertisement
“ The process is confidential , ” said a spokesman for the Comptroller of the Currency , which regulates national banks .
Huge capital injections were made to Wells Fargo & Co. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. , among many other household names .
The controversial effort was intended to restore confidence in the banking system .
“ People often ask : How do we know our program is working ?
First , we did not allow the financial system to collapse , ” Neel Kashkari , chief of the Office of Financial Stabilization , told Congress on Dec. 10 .
City National ’s $ 400 - million capital injection was the second largest among the 33 banks in California that have received funds through Dec. 22 , according to the most recent Treasury transaction report .
A total of $ 27.3 billion was given to California institutions , led by $ 25 billion for San Francisco - based Wells Fargo .
Advertisement
City National lacks a broad consumer banking network .
The bank ’s identification with wealthy clients , its headquarters in Beverly Hills and its association with an industry that is often viewed by outsiders as quirky may have played some part in why it was singled out for a review .
But its strong balance sheet exactly fits the profile of a bank that the Treasury Department wants to pour money into .
“ We firmly believe that healthy banks of all sizes should use this program to continue making credit available in their communities , ” Kashkari told a House committee in December .
In a televised interview last month , City National CEO Goldsmith said the federal program was cutting down on fear , and he criticized people who expected instant results .

“ You do n’t lend out $ 400 million in two weeks , ” he told CNBC .

DES MOINES , Iowa , Jan. 14 ( UPI ) --
Firefighters say a cat is the hero and a goat is the goat in a house fire that destroyed an Iowa home this week .
The blaze in Warren County was believed to have been started by a goat that knocked over a space heater in an attached shed Tuesday and it might have proved deadly had the family cat not awakened the sleeping residents .

" My cat woke me up and I saw smoke coming out of my fan , " John
Hadley told KCCI -TV , Des Moines .
I made sure I got her ( Hadley 's mother ) out and then I know she loves her animals , so I rounded all her animals up , and by that point , flames and smoke were everywhere . "
Hadley and the other two people in the house had to wait in freezing cold for firefighters to arrive from several miles away .
Officials told KCCI there was n't much they could do by the time they were on scene .
All the people were unharmed as were the two goats and the family dog .
The hero cat apparently bolted the scene and was still missing Wednesday , although Hadley was certain it was alive and well .
And yet I 'm finding that I feel more at home -- more welcomed , more valued , more truly understood -- as a queer in the atheist community than I do as an atheist in the queer community .
Like , a lot more .
I 've heard the LGBT movement described as divided into two distinct groups : the reasonable ones who want to work with religious groups , and the unreasonable ones who think that religion is a delusion .
The role of many branches of the Christian church in passing Proposition 8 in California and Obama 's selection of Rick Warren to give the invocation at his presidential inauguration suggest that an alliance between the atheist and LGBT communities might be worthy of serious consideration .
We have a great deal in common .
We also share a common " enemy " in Christian extremists , a group determined to treat us as second - class citizens with restricted civil rights .
In this post , I 'd like to address what I perceive as the two primary obstacles to such an alliance .
At the outset , let me be clear in stating that I recognize that there are probably many obstacles to such an alliance than what I will mention here .
I am focusing on the two I perceive to be the most serious .
I would also like to mention that I believe that both of these obstacles can be overcome .
Of course , there are many atheist activists , including some who have been leaders in this regard .
However , there is still far too much apathy among atheists .
The mindset of just wanting to be left alone by one 's religious neighbors is far more common than any true activist impulse among atheists .
Too many of us resist any sort of organization and turn our backs on the politics which has alienated us for so long .
In the so - called " new atheism , " we have witnessed the beginnings of what might be described as an awakening ; an awakening in the sense that some of us are beginning to realize that sitting idly by imperils us all .
There is a genuine undercurrent of atheist activism building , but it is still being resisted by many .
To make real progress , we need to recognize that the atheist movement is about civil rights .
We need to learn that by working for the good of all atheists , we are simultaneously helping ourselves , opposing religious extremism , and making it easier for future generations of atheists to be themselves .
Getting involved in atheist activism can start small , but it does need to start .
What I am about to say may be unpopular , but it needs to be said .
One of the main obstacles preventing an effective atheist - gay alliance is anti-atheist bigotry within the gay community .
Since I am not gay , I realize that I may have precious little credibility here .
For this reason , I 'd like to draw your attention to an excellent post written byabout her experience as an atheist in the gay community .
She describes her experience as follows :
In her post , she describes many experiences of being made to feel like less of a gay activist because of her atheism .
There are probably many reasons for this .
Certainly , there are many gay people who are also religious .
Even among those who are n't , there are differences of opinion regarding how best to work with those in the religious community .
Sound familiar ?
See , I told you we had a lot in common !
Greta Christina perceives the atheist community as being very supportive of gay rights .
I agree .
I recognize that this is not a universal sentiment , but it is good to hear that it seems to apply to the majority .
She attributes much of the difference ( i.e. , atheists tend to be more supportive of gay rights than gays do of atheist rights ) to the length with which each movement has been active .
I think this is an excellent point .
We 've had 40 years to learn about LGBT Americans and only a couple to learn about atheists .
Greta Christina offers many useful suggestions for how members of the gay community can ally with atheists .
Best of all , her ideas apply to members of any group interesting in allying with atheists .
And if you are an atheist , make sure you read what she has to say too .
Unfortunately , I see some atheists making many of the same mistakes she highlights here ( e.g. , there is no such thing as a " fundamentalist " atheist ) .
Iceland on the Thames Can Countries Really Go Bankrupt ?
The bailout packages aimed at shoring up financial markets in Europe are getting increasingly expensive .
A creeping depreciation of currency is inevitable and state bankruptcies can no longer be ruled out .
Could the euro zone also fall victim to the global financial crisis ?

The Bug That Shut Down Computers World - Wide was originally published on October 2nd , 2007 , and today marks the twenty - fifth anniversary of the story .
Here ’s to a great 2009 !
Where were you the morning of January 1st , 1984 ?
Me ?
I was out living it up at Divestiture - fest ’ 84 and – let me tell you – it was quite a party .
We drank until those seven little Baby Bells looked like fourteen , and kept drinking until it all looked like AT&T again .
Ah , the good old days .
But not all of us were out celebrating .
Some – like Robert Reagan – were actually working , desperately trying to fix the bug that shut down computers across the world .
With all the “ oh no , the world ’s gonna end ” date problems out there – Y2 K , DST , The End of the Epoch , and Y2070 – it ’s surprising that most have n’t heard of the day that the world actually ended .
On that day – January 1st , 1984 – a single bug was responsible for shutting down – and keeping down – a whole lot of computer systems .
There were three big rages back in the 1980’s : Rubik ’s cubes , Molly Ringwald , and Wangs .
While I ’m sure you are all familiar with those first two 80 ’s icons , Wangs – i.e. , any one of the many systems from Wang Laboratories – have fallen into the void of boring , obsolete computer junk .
But a quarter century ago , Wang was where it was at .
Around 1983 , Wang Laboratories employed upwards of 30,000 people and brought in revenues of nearly $ 6 billion / year ( in today ’s dollars ) .
And their computers were everywhere .
The Wang OIS ( Office Information System ) was perfect for many businesses and allowed “ easy extensibility ” through its Glossary programming language .
It was so simple , apparently , that secretaries were able to master it .
Wang was even able to compete with IBM ’s System 34 and System 36’s with their own line of mini-computers called the Wang VS .
These systems hosted the standard development tools – COBOL , BASIC , RPG , etc – and its own .
And like many Operating Systems of Old , the Wang VS was a little peculiar .
One interesting security feature of the Wang VS was File Expiration Dates .
In addition to having a Creation and Modification date , files included an Expiration date .
If someone – regardless of his / her security privileges – attempted to delete a file not past expiration , the operating system would raise an error .
Although users could easily change the expiration date with another command , it was seen as a “ nice to have ” that prevented accidental deletions .
Like many operating systems , the Wang VS and its applications utilized temporary files to do all sorts of things , from caching to scheduling .
Like many modern development environments , there was no built - in mechanism for date / time calculations .
Different modules of the operating system and its applications relied on different functions for different date / time calculations .
Not surprisingly , one of these functions had a bug .
Unfortunately , the bug was in the temporary file creation module .
Specifically , it mistakenly incremented the zero - indexed day - of - year for all day - of - years that are equal to 0 in a leap - year .
In other words , when January 1 , 1984 ( day 0 in a leap year ) hit , the code set “ January 2 , 1984 ” as a temporary file ’s expiration date .
Because temporary files are created and deleted in a manner of seconds , the operating system was blocked from deleting its own files .
One by one , processes in the Wang VS shut down and the computers grinded to a halt .
Since boot time activity included the creation and deletion of temporary files , the operating system boot process could not complete .
This effectively put ever single Wang VS computer in an unbootable state .
Wang engineers and support techs worked around - the - clock to restore and fix everyone ’s broken computer .
Thankfully , a combination of the New Year ’s Day holiday and FedEx ( who , apparently , were all using IBM computers ) overnight shipping , most businesses only suffered a minor disruption of service .
And the day the world ended – January 1st , 1984 – passed like every other .

Militants who have seized control of large parts of Pakistan 's Swat Valley are issuing " wanted lists " for four dozen people they plan to bring before makeshift sharia courts for summary justice .
In one of his notorious radio broadcasts , Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah named politicians and government officials " wanted " by the militants .
" These people encouraged military operations in the area and are responsible for the killings of Taliban and civilians , " said the cleric .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The creation of the list is the latest threat from militants who have gradually spread their control over more than three - quarters of the Swat Valley , one of Pakistan 's most celebrated tourist areas .
In recent weeks , their brutality has increased with a series of public executions and the issuing of a numberofedicts .
Some 180 girls ' schools have been set ablaze , while Sunday was the deadline set by the militants for all men in part of the valley to stop shaving and begin growing full beards .
A spokesman for the Taliban , said thewanted list was drawn up following a meeting or shura chaired by MrFazlullah .
" All of them will have to appear before the Taliban court , or they will face action , " Muslim Khan , a spokesman for the Swat Taliban , told The News newspaper .
The list is made up of local and provincial politicians and officials .
Topping the list is Afzal Khan Lala , a veteran politician and member of the Awami National Party , which heads the provincial government .
The 82 - year - old , who has been attacked by militants several times , recently vowed to remain at his home in Drushkhela , in the valley , rather than relocating to either Peshawar or Islamabad for safety , as many have done .
At the time , he said : " I have asked the governor of North West Frontier Province to provide arms and support to thepeopleof Swat , to help them fight back and protect themselves against themilitants …
They need help to gather courage and fight . "
Those who have dared stand up to the Taliban in part of Pakistan once famed for its orchards and trout fishing , have been treated brutally , and usually in a very public fashion intended to deter others .
A local tribal leader , Pir Samiullah , who was killed after he and his followers confronted the militants at his home in the village of Mandal Dag , was exhumed and his body strung up in a public square .
Those of his followers who refused to indicate where his body had been buried were beheaded .
In the face of the militants ' seemingly irresistible domination of the valley , located in the North West Frontier Province and just five hours from Islamabad , the army has boosted the number of troops in the area .
Yesterday , the military launched a series of assaults on several militant strongholds in the valley .
Yet local residents and politicians , forced from the area by the militants ' threats , say not enough is being done .
Local officials said that a curfew had been imposed in an attempt to try to help the troops impose law and order .
" A curfew has been imposed ... for an indefinite period , " said a statement by the local government .
" Anybody violating the curfew will be shot on sight .
No vehicle is allowed tomove in these areas , " it said .

Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska fell slightly behind his Democratic rival , Mark Begich , on Wednesday , as ballot counting continued in one of the nation ’s most closely fought Senate races .
In an initial count after Election Day , Mr. Stevens led Mr. Begich , the mayor of Anchorage , by 3,257 votes .
Mr. Begich led Mr. Stevens by just 814 votes after about 57,000 additional ballots were counted on Wednesday .
So far , about 279,000 votes have been counted in the Senate race , and about 35,000 more remain to be counted .
It could be next week before the count is complete .
Republicans claimed then that traditional voting patterns among absentee voters favored Mr. Stevens ’s holding on to win , but Mr. Begich countered that he had made a concerted effort to win early and absentee voters .
Initial counts of those ballots appear to be favoring Mr. Begich .
Israeli defence officials also announced that one soldier was killed when soldiers fought off an attempt by Hamas fighters to capture Israeli soldiers hours after the ground operation began .
They said the infantrymen were advancing up a strategic hill before dawn Sunday when militants emerged from a tunnel and tried to drag two Israeli infantrymen inside .
It was a dead heat .
General Motors sold 9.37 million vehicles worldwide in 2007 and lost $ 38.7 billion .
Toyota sold 9.37 million vehicles in 2007 and made $ 17.1 billion .
That was the second best sales total in GM 's 100 - year history and the biggest loss ever for any automaker in the world .
For Toyota , that was roughly $ 1,800 in profit for every vehicle sold .
For GM , it was an average loss of $ 4,100 for every vehicle sold .
Collectively , Detroit's Big
Three automakers are currently losing about $ 5 billion per month , with Ford , General Motors and Chrysler , respectively , burning through $ 2 billion , $ 2 billion and $ 1 billion in cash every 30 days .
Tin cups in hand again during their recent testimony in Congress , leaving their corporate jets at home this time and promising to cut their paychecks to $ 1 per year , the CEOs from the Big Three came to Washington in even worse shape than during their Congressional appearance in November , upping their money appeal by $ 9 billion , from $ 25 billion to $ 34 billion .
That 's on top of the $ 25 billion in already authorized money to retool their plants .
General Motors and Chrysler added a " rush " to their latest bailout request , telling D.C. 's lawmakers that they need , respectively , an immediate $ 4 billion and $ 7 billion to ensure minimum liquidity levels , paid prior to the end of December .
GM , as well , asked for an additional $ 4 billion for January and a third handout of $ 2 billion in the February / March time frame to forestall a financial calamity , plus a $ 6 billion line of credit from the federal government to ensure ample liquidity .
All told , GM says it needs an $ 18 billion taxpayer bailout , some 50 percent more than it said it needed just three weeks ago to turn things around .
With its hourly workforce already down 52 percent since 2000 , from 133,000 to 64,000 , and its executive ranks and salaried employees down , respectively , by 45 percent and 32 percent in the same period , General Motors now says it can get back on its feet by getting rid of its Saturn , Hummer and Saab lines and putting Pontiac on an endangered - brand list .
Also in GM 's proposal for survival , and for paying back the money by 2011 , is the elimination of 1,750 dealerships , the closing of four of its 47 plants , an additional 31,500 job cuts , and a new age of " full labor competitiveness " with foreign manufacturers in the U.S. within the next three years .
Currently , UAW workers at Ford , GM and Chrysler earn an average of $ 28 per hour , plus benefits .
At the Toyota and Honda non-union plants in the United States , the hourly rate , excluding benefits , is $ 26 and $ 24 , respectively .
Add the cost of benefits for the current workforce and the cost of pensions and health care for retirees ( benefit - collecting retirees outnumber current workers by three - to - one at GM , Ford and Chrysler ) and the difference in labor cost between a Toyota plant in the US .
and the plants of Detroit 's automakers jumps to $ 29 per hour .
More specifically , the hourly compensation cost for labor , including benefits and retirees ' costs , at the Big Three is $ 73 per hour , compared with $ 44 per hour at a Toyota factory with American workers in the U.S .
Further , it takes fewer hours of labor to produce a car in Toyota 's U.S. plants than at the plants of Detroit 's automakers .
With more flexible work rules , GM says it could save hundreds of dollars per vehicle .
The company maintains , for instance , that a company - wide use on non-union janitors , earning $ 12 per hour , would cut costs and increase competitiveness by up to $ 500 million a year .
Similarly , health care costs at GM for active workers and retirees account for more than a quarter of total labor compensation , adding approximately $ 1,000 in cost to every GM vehicle , compared to $ 215 in health care costs in each Toyota produced in U.S. plants .
Under UAW contracts , additionally , laid off workers are transferred to a jobs bank and receive 95 percent of their full pay and benefits to not work .
This year , the cost to the Big Three will be an estimated $ 478 million , about $ 70 million less than Honda spent to build a brand new factory in Indiana .
Somewhere along the line , both management and labor in Detroit forgot the good economic advice of UAW head Walter Reuter : " Getting more and more pay for less and less work is a dead end street . "

Coen take on ' clean ' coal in TV spoof Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday February 26 , 2009
Print This Email This Beware the " greenwash . "
That 's the underlying message of famed filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen 's latest side - project :
A television commercial lampooning the myth of " clean " coal through the visual metaphor of an air freshener that spews black smoke .
" Is regular clean enough for your family ? , " asks a phony salesman as thick , noxious fumes permeate the air .
" Get clean coal clean . "
Watch the video , released on behalf of the Reality Coalition :
" Clean " coal refers to a method called carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , whereas carbon put off by coal is injected under the ground or otherwise stored and kept out of the air .
The technology , though heavily discussed and promoted in the media , has not yet become widespread .
And , last December , the United Nations put some " clean " coal initiatives on the " back burner , " said Popular Mechanics .
" However , burning coal produces about 9 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year which is released to the atmosphere , about 70 % of this being from power generation , " claims the World Nuclear Association .
" Other estimates put carbon dioxide emissions from power generation at one third of the world total of over 25 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions .
In other words , states the Reality Coalition , " CO2 emissions from U.S. coal - based electricity are greater than emissions from all the cars and trucks in America . "
" The coal industry is spending millions advertising ' clean ' coal , but not a single ' clean ' coal power plant exists in the U.S. today , " reads the group 's Web site .
" [ Despite ] some commercial demonstrations of such carbon sequestration technology , largely to help recover more oil from depleted fields , none have approached anywhere near the scale necessary to significantly impact the 9.3 billion metric tons of CO2  and rising  emitted every year from burning coal , " study on the matter .
Or this study by the International Energy Agency .
Bear in mind these reports were written before the US government last year pulled out of FutureGen , its only large - scale R&D programme for carbon - capture technology , " wrote The Guardian 's Fred Pearce , who called " clean " coal a " greenwash " and " the ultimate climate change oxymoron . "
" Sadly , for too many policy - makers , the idea that we can have coal and tackle climate change at the same time is too good to miss , " he concluded .
" Sadly , it is too good to be true . "

The end of the Bush era may signal the end of the " abstinence - only " approach to sex education programs .
Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York hopes to end the failing programs with the " Prevention First Act . "
Slaughter , who is sponsoring the act along with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado , aims to shift the focus from a " no sex , no pregnancy " mentality to a much more realistic teaching method that encourages young people to make safe , responsible choices .
" We believe the amount of money that goes into [ abstinence - only education ] would be so much better used on things to prevent unwanted pregnancies , " Slaughter says , " I think we 'll have enough votes to deal with it . "
Currently , about 176 million dollars is spent on abstinence - only education , and studies have shown that the programs simply do n't work .

The Prevention First
Act would push for realistic , open education , with the mentality that teens need more that the words " don't " in order to properly prepare themselves , mentally and physically , for sexual activity .
Contraception , medically accurate information , would be discussed , providing kids with realistic options .
The act also seeks to improve public awareness of emergency contraception , ensure that rape victims are provided with proper information and emergency contraception options , and to force insurance companies to provide women with proper coverage regarding contraception .
According to Slaughter , a compromise , where in abstinence - only education is also offered to kids , would be unacceptable .
" We can't have both , because abstinence - only does n't work , " Slaughter says .

Sarah Brown of The National Coalition to Prevent Teen And Unplanned Pregnancy agrees , and notes that in such tough economic times , the country can't afford to keep spending millions and millions of dollars on programs that have been proven to be ineffective .
" In a highly constrained fiscal environment , it 's critical to focus precious dollars on programs that have evidence of good effects , " Brown says , " When you look at the best science , the abstinence - only programs come up short . "

Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull says former treasurer Peter Costello has recently told him that he is not interested in the Liberal leadership .
It has been a difficult week for the Coalition , with a dispute about the circumstances of an offer to Mr Costello to become shadow treasurer , a gaffe by frontbencher Tony Abbott , and the sacking of frontbencher Cory Bernardi .
" The [ Costello ] issue is closed , " Mr Turnbull told Fairfax Radio this morning .
" I do n't want to go into private conversations .
" Peter and I have discussed it and we agreed that what I would say , and the position would be literally , that he has made it clear that he is not interested in a frontbench or leadership [ position ] .
" Peter has made it very clear that he is not interested in either a frontbench or leadership role . "
Mr Costello has repeatedly refused to spell out his political future and whether he has aspirations for the Opposition leader 's role .

Researchers who created the first so - called invisibility cloak in 2006 , have made significant advances that could lead to an invisibility cloak for visible light in as little as six months .
" A large number of folks are looking at it , and I think it 's a matter of coupling the right material to the right device , " [ Discovery News ]
Invisibility cloaks rely on metamaterial s , ones with unique properties that derive from [ their ] physical structure , not [ their ] chemical make up
said researcher David Smith .
His team has developed an algorithm that speeds up the design of materials that can bend light around an object .
Using the new algorithm , they were able to create an invisibility cloak that can bend much wider spectrum of microwaves than previous versions .
[ Discovery News ]
.
Smith compares the effect of metamaterials on light to mirages that appear over a road on sweltering days .
" You see what looks like water hovering over the road , but it is in reality a reflection from the sky , " Smith said .
" In that example , the mirage you see is cloaking the road below .
In effect , we are creating an engineered mirage with this latest cloak design " [ AFP ] .
The new cloaking device measures 20 inches by 4 inches and is made up of 6,000 I - shaped copper structures placed on a circuit board .
Whereas previously , researchers needed to individually calculate the dimensions and placement of each copper piece , an extremely time - consuming process , the new algorithms automate the task ; the team designed and made the new cloak in just ten days .
The researchers report in
Science
[ subscription required ] that the new cloak works with frequencies of microwave radiation ranging from about 1 to 18 gigahertz . (
To manipulate light , the microscopic surface of a material must be much smaller than that of the wave length of light being used [ Discovery News ]
, so the smaller the wavelength of light , the harder it is to cloak . )
They were able to hide a one - inch bump using the new cloak .
But the new cloak does have limitations :
It only works in two dimensions .
Both the background and the hidden object must also both be wrapped in the metamaterial [ Discovery News ] .
If these limitations can be overcome , invisibility cloaks could have endless applications .
They could remove cell - phone interference , allowing clear reception even in elevators , suggested Smith .
" By eliminating the effects of obstructions , cloaking devices could improve wireless communications , or acoustic cloaks could serve as protective shields , preventing the penetration of vibrations , sound or seismic waves , " said the team [ AFP ] .
Unlike so many other cutting - edge technologies , the invisibility cloak is also cheap to produce .
Smith 's rough estimate was that it took about $ 1.00 in circuit boards to cloak the one - inch bump on the metamaterial .
" If you were to commercialize this technology it would cost next to nothing , " said Smith [ Discovery News ] .

Jasmine Guinness belongs to one of Ireland 's most famous - and richest - families .
She grew up in the grounds of a 12th - century castle where her grandparents and parents entertained rock 'n ' roll royalty , including the Rolling Stones .
Less happily , Diana Mitford , wife of the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley and a keen supporter of Hitler , was her great - grandmother .
But her father Patrick Guinness 's dynastic clan of old money and bohemia is a world apart from her mother Liz Casey 's family of persecuted and impoverished farmers .
She has always been intrigued by the mystery surrounding her maternal forebears .
Last year she began to look into the past as part of a family history show on Irish television .
She discovered that while her father 's family made vast fortunes during the famine years , the Caseys virtually starved .
" People tend to assume that I come from a long line of castle - dwelling gentry and am made of money , " says the 32 - year - old model when we meet in her toyshop , Honeyjam , on Portobello Road in Notting Hill .
" If I meet someone with a name like Rothschild or Astor , I fall for that , too , and immediately think they 're minted .
So I do n't blame people for making assumptions .
The programme made me realise what a huge mix we all are . "
There were no noted names in her maternal lineage .
The Caseys , displaced Catholic refugees from Belfast , endured mob prejudice and terrible poverty .
They fled to Cork and eked out a living in the deprived , disease - ridden rural community of 19th - century Tyrone .
" I knew nothing about my mum 's family , " she says .
" Her parents were dead by the time she was 14 .
She was brought up by two aunts and she only ever met one uncle . "
Guinness lives in London with her producer husband Gawain Rainey , 38 , and their two children Elwood , seven , and Otis , three .
She travelled with her mother to the island farm in Tyrone to seek out the ghosts of her little - known relatives .
She came close to tears when they visited the marshy land , contemplating the struggles of her mother 's great - great - grandparents , Joseph and Maeve Casey , and their son , Francis , as starvation raged through the county .
" It 's an amazing feeling standing exactly where your family stood centuries ago , looking at the view that they saw every day and feeling the earth that they worked every day under your feet . "
Guinness has long been obsessed , she says , with the whims of fate : how small choices , chance encounters , and strokes of fortune can alter the course of a life or determine our existence .
"
If my mum 's great - great - grandparents had n't sent off their only son because they could n't feed him , they would have perished .
As they were flax farmers , he went to an apprenticeship to learn about manufacturing oil - cloth and tarpaulin .
We discovered that he married a prosperous farmer 's daughter from Moy and became a successful businessman making and selling oil - cloth and tarpaulin to ship - builders in Belfast .
I felt thankful to them for the hard decisions they made . "
She found the plight of her long - lost ancestors humbling and was impressed by how fortunate they were to have survived when millions of others died .
" It helps you appreciate the huge sacrifices that people have made along the way .
Their landlord , the Earl of Caledon , set up soup kitchens just to keep his tenants alive and the only reason they survived is because of the kindness of this one man . "
She also has a strong sense of pride : " I was pleased that my ancestors were hard - working , Gaelic - speaking Catholics .
It was n't an easy thing to be at that time , so I know they had strong beliefs and were brave in the face of adversity .
" Mum and I were delighted to find out we were descended from ' bog - trotters ' .
In the programme , we were laughing about us really being ' bog - trotters ' because here we are standing in a bog and this is where we 're from . "
But when the programme was broadcast in Ireland , Guinness got a lot of flak .
" The papers were really snotty , " she says with a giggle , plainly not unduly hurt .
" They took the piss and wrote things like : ' Oh , poor Jasmine Guinness .
How dare she say that she came from peasant farmers in Tyrone when they had 22 acres ? '
But what they failed to mention is that my mum 's family were tenant farmers .
These were n't our 22 acres .
They had nothing . "
In fact , her sympathy is for more than just her forebears .
" It was more of a shock thinking about how the famine affected everyone .
How many people died by the side of the road , in the streets of Dublin or in a hellish coffin ship and eventually watery graves as they tried to emigrate ? "
The activities of her paternal family gave little comfort .
They controlled much of the country 's barley harvest to brew velvety Irish stout for the English market , which , along with meat , barley and wheat exports , was shipped under armed guard to Britain as the starving multitudes looked on in despair .
They also exploited the desperation of hard - up families who were fleeing the country by buying up disused and abandoned land at rock - bottom prices to set up their family estates .
Yet Guinness refuses to condemn her millionaire ancestors .
" The family did contribute to famine - relief funds but that was edited out of the show .
Guinness was the first to introduce pensions for its workers 200 years ago .
It built schools , hospitals and housing , all of which was unheard of at that time . "
Being a Guinness , she concedes , is a double - edged sword .
" I 'm very proud of the family name .
It can be really helpful sometimes and I 'm happy to use it shamelessly if I 'm asking favours for a good cause .
Butwhen I started modelling there was a lot of resentment . "
She also has the sprawling Mitford legacy to contend with and the long shadow of her great - grandmother Diana , from whom she has inherited her ice - blue eyes .
" I only met her a few times and thought she was scary .
As for the fascism , it was awful , appalling ... really stupid .
I suppose you fall in love with a man , you support him until the end , so to a small extent I understand that .
But I do n't agree with her politics . "
Despite her surname and glamorous background , Guinness insists that she is not another couture - loving socialite but works to earn her crust : " As it happens , I grew up on a beautiful farm and my grandparents lived in this incredibly grand house next door .
But I have n't been brought up with the mentality of an heiress , " she explains .
" The only reason my parents got by is because my grandfather gave us a cottage to live in . "
That gilded world of inherited wealth is long gone : " I 've worked since I was 18 .
I have no trust fund and do n't expect anything .
The truth is , there are so many of us now that there is n't enough money to go around , " she says .
The toyshop , which she co-owns with a childhood friend , is her day job .
And her children , she says , put the work into perspective .
" It may sound cliched , but when you become a parent suddenly nothing else is important any longer . "
Her own childhood was played out at her grandfather Desmond Guinness 's Leixlip Castle , with bonfires under the stars , ponies and blues records .
She shared a little guest cottage with her parents amid the communal , hippyish atmosphere of an extended , chaotic family and friends .
" My mother was only 17 when I was born , so the three of us grew up together in a way . "
Surrounded by a perpetual rock 'n ' roll circus , Guinness was plunged into the sometimes squalid world that revolved around her parents ' unconventional lifestyle .
" Everyone was always welcome .
So all the liggers came . "
Not that all the visitors were opportunists : her godmother , Marianne Faithfull , helped Guinness 's mother to stop drinking .
Her parents split up when she was 12 , and she chose to stay at Leixlip with her grandparents .
But she seems remarkably unresentful : " My parents went away to grow up and live their own lives and do all the things they missed out on because of me .
It was very unselfish of them as they knew I did n't need to be moved about to strange places .
Only now that I am a parent myself , do I realise how heartbreaking it must 've been for them to leave me . "
" It 's great to know where your roots lie and where everything truly began , because that goes to the heart of your identity .
We are here , and that in itself is an achievement of our ancestors . "
The small asteroid 2008 TC3 broke up in the atmosphere above Sudan on 7 October and left behind this wind - blown trail high in the sky ( Image : Mohamed Elhassan Abdelatif Mahir / Noub NGO / Muawia H Shaddad / U Khartoum / Peter Jenniskens / SETI Institute / NASA Ames )
The discovery of meteorites from an asteroid that exploded over Sudan in October completes an astronomical trifecta .
For the first time , scientists have detected a space rock ahead of a collision with Earth , watched it streak through the atmosphere , and then recovered pieces of it .
Analysis of the meteorites could shed light on conditions in the early solar system more than 4 billion years ago .
When the asteroid , called 2008 TC3 , was discovered on 6 October last year , it was just 20 hours away from hitting Earth .
Though the warning period was short , it was the first time a space rock had been found before it impacted the planet .

Orbital calculations predicted the object would plunge into the atmosphere above Sudan at 0246 GMT on 7 October , and it arrived right on time .
Observations suggested it was no more than 5 metres across , too small to survive intact all the way to the ground and cause damage .
The brilliant fireball it made as it descended through the atmosphere was seen far in the distance by the crew of a KLM airliner , and was observed by various satellites , including a weather satellite called Meteosat - 8 .
Now , a team of meteorite hunters has found fragments of the object .
The meteorites are a unique group in that they come from an object seen hurtling through space before its plunge into Earth ’s atmosphere .
Numerous fragments
Students from the University of Khartoum , led by Dr Muawia Shaddad , found the first fragments using data provided by NASA to home in on where fragments were likely to be found .
Scientists involved with the discovery , including Peter Jenniskens of the SETI Institute in Mountain View , California , have reportedly submitted a study about the find to a scientific journal , and have not responded to interview requests .
But Lindley Johnson , head of NASA ’s Near - Earth Object Program office at the agency ’s headquarters in Washington , DC , reported the find on Monday in Vienna , at a United Nations meeting discussing near - Earth object ( NEO ) impacts .
An image of the first fragment found is included in the slides from Johnson ’s presentation ( pdf ) ( see slide 19 ) .
Donald Yeomans , who manages NASA ’s efforts to find and track NEOs at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California , confirmed that “ quite a few ” fragments have been found but declined to discuss them further .
Weak material ?
Before the fragments were found , meteorite expert Peter Brown of the University of Western Ontario in Canada said the asteroid was likely made of relatively weak material , given that 2008 TC3 broke up unusually quickly once it hit the atmosphere , exploding about 37 kilometres above ground .
Another object known to have broken up at about this height scattered fragments over Tagish Lake in Canada in 2000 .
The Tagish Lake meteorites turned out to be made of a very crumbly material , and fall into a class of meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites , which have been modified little by heat or other processes since the solar system formed more than 4.5 billion years ago .
“ I would caution making direct compositional comparisons [ with the Tagish Lake meteorites ] , but it does certainly underscore the global weakness of [ 2008 TC3 ] , ” Brown said in comments posted on the JPL website in November .
He added that observations of the rock ’s quick breakup “ all but rule out ” a composition rich in iron .
Point of origin
When the analysis of these rock fragments does come out , what is it likely to tell us ?
Meteorites in general provide a valuable record of conditions in the early solar system , such as temperature and chemical composition .
And the 2008 TC3 meteorites could be especially illuminating because the parent object was observed in space before the breakup , allowing scientists to calculate its former orbit around the Sun .
This provides precious information connecting the meteorites to their place of origin in the solar system .
For most other meteorites , such calculations involve a lot of guesswork .
Meteorites had previously been recovered after about 10 “ fireball ” events , where parent space rocks were observed streaking through the sky .
But in those cases , scientists had to try to reconstruct the object ’s orbit based on its path through the atmosphere .
“ It ’s often very difficult to get from a streak in the sky to what the orbit was , ” says Allan Treiman of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Tucson , Arizona .
“ But if they ’ve got its location before it hit the atmosphere , they ’re far better off – that ’s really wonderful . ”
It seems you just can't keep a good worm down .
Nearly two months after Microsoft first warned of the Conficker worm targeting a vulnerability in its Server service , the number of infected computers is growing rapidly .
While there is some dispute about the number of infections - F - Secure puts it at approximately 9 million , though others dispute that - the general consensus from companies such as Symantec and Kaspersky Lab is that the number of infections is in the millions .
At the moment , security researchers can only speculate as to what the intentions of the authors of the worm are .
Some security researchers have suggested there may be plans in the works to use the infected computers as a massive botnet .
" [ We ] have n't seen it download anything yet , " noted Joe Stewart , director of malware research at SecureWorks .
" Technically it already is a botnet , but it just is lacking a viable C&C [ command and control ] server at the moment .
That could change at any time . "
The worm is also referred to by security vendors as Downadup and Kido .
Besides targeting the Microsoft flaw , which was patched in October , the latest variant is also spreading through removable media as well as by copying itself to network shares by guessing weak passwords .
These days , network worms need different mechanisms to make their way onto a corporate network , explained Roel Schouwenberg , senior anti-virus researcher at Kaspersky Lab .
" Given the way that the majority of ISPs and corporations function these days - they block quite a number of network ports - it 's very hard for a network worm to get in from the outside , " Schouwenberg said .
" During 2008 we 've seen a huge uprise in the amount of malware that was replicated via Windows ' AutoRun functionality - USB devices - and they are successful in getting onto networks from the inside .
So what I think is likely happening is that infected USB sticks are being brought into corporate networks , infecting one workstation , [ from ] which in turn [ the malware ] starts to spread across the LAN . "
Still , data from application scanning vendor Qualys indicates that many people have yet to apply the patch released by Microsoft .
Qualys CTO
Wolfgang Kandek said more than 50 percent of machines were patched after about 30 days .
The rate of patching diminished after that , however , apparently leaving millions of machines vulnerable .
" Unfortunately this leaves enough machines to be exploited by the Conficker worm types even today , over 45 days later , " Kandek said .
" We would have liked to see a faster reaction by the computer users given the significance of the patch , but there still seems to be a barrier to reach[ing ] everybody and mak[ing ] them understand the urgency of patching . "
For its part , Microsoft updated its Malicious Software Removal Tool in January to help users clean the latest variant of the worm from their systems .
" The current damage is the mess it causes to networks it infects in terms of cleaning it up from all the computers and USB or network drives , without having it reinfect the computers that have already been cleaned , " Stewart said .
" Once it starts dropping payloads , we 'll have a better idea of what it 's designed to really do .
I 'm putting my money on it installing rogue AV . "
Frankfurt - based bank KfW is under investigation for negligence
The Frankfurt offices of German bank KfW have been searched by investigators following its transfer of 319 m euros ( £ 251 m ; $ 410 m ) to Lehman Brothers .
Authorities are investigating whether the transfer , which took place on the same day that US bank Lehman filed for bankruptcy , could have been prevented .
Prosecutors said they would determine whether board members had acted criminally in allowing the transfer .
State - owned KfW said it would co-operate fully with the inquiry .
A statement by the prosecutors said its investigation would discover whether KfW " violated legal obligations to safeguard assets ... despite knowledge of signs of liquidity problems at Lehman Brothers " .
KfW said it had mistakenly transferred the funds as part of a swap deal .
Last month , the bank sacked two board members over the transfer , which caused widespread embarrassment to the country 's financial institutions and to the Berlin government .
German newspaper Bild called KfW " Germany 's dumbest bank " when news of the transfer broke .

BBC News , Sidon , Lebanon
Anti-Syrian protests erupted in 2005
The upbeat tune of the Syrian national anthem echoed through the empty stadium overlooking the Mediterranean Sea in the Lebanese city of Sidon .
Dozens of soldiers with machine guns guarded every entrance .
As the Lebanese and Syrian footballers listened to their anthems they raised their heads high and focused their eyes on rows of empty white chairs .
The only spectators at this Asia Cup qualifier were a handful of journalists and a few officials from the football federation .
" Football is political here and security has to be tight , " one of the federation officials explained .
It is because of politics that Syria and Lebanon have not played each other at home in years .
Previous matches took place elsewhere in the Middle East .
We were treated with intentional carelessness by our hosts .
Bahaa al - Omary
Syrian football official
The fact that this game happened was , observers say , a sign that the relationship between the two neighbours is improving .
But there were also plenty of reminders of how far things still have to go .
No -one failed to notice the irony of the choice of venue - the Rafik Hariri stadium - named after Lebanon 's former prime minister who was killed in a car bomb in 2005 .
While Syria denied any involvement in the assassination , tens of thousands took to the streets of Beirut and blamed Damascus for the killing .
The combination of public protest and international pressure forced Syria to end its 30 - year military and political occupation of Lebanon .
Three years on , the two sides have finally agreed to create diplomatic relations .
This week Damascus approved the first ever Lebanese ambassador to Syria , embassies are about to open , and as the footballers met on the pitch , Lebanon 's Defence Minister Elias Murr held talks in Damascus .
Syria recently opened an embassy in Beirut Only recently Mr Murr 's visit to Syria would have been impossible to imagine .
In 2005 Mr Murr escaped an assassination attempt , which he blamed on Syrian intelligence agents .
But Wednesday 's football game showed once again just how difficult it will be to rebuild trust .
After winning the match 2 - 0 , one of the Syrian football officials went on Lebanese television to complain about the hosts .
Poisoning claim " We were treated with intentional carelessness by our hosts .
" There is no excuse for it , and brotherly countries should not be dealt in that way , " Bahaa al - Omary later told the BBC .
Mr Omary said that on the eve of the game eight Syrian footballers got food poisoning and were taken to hospital .
The Syrian team doctor found the poisoning " highly suspicious " .
Lebanese officials were quick to promise an investigation , but whether in politics or football , the essence of the Syrian - Lebanese relations still lies in a deep and all - pervasive lack of trust .

Casualties Near a School in Gaza

Google 's New Favicon : Not My Favorite
At the end of last week , Google made a small change that 's been bugging me a little ever since .
It changed its favicon -- the little " favorites icon " graphic that displays in the address bar and bookmarks or favorites menus of most browsers -- to a new , much more colorful design .
This is the second time Google has changed this , and I 'm not sure why .
Last summer , its favicon was a simple , blue , capital - letter " G " set in a white square and had been so for the last eight and a half years .
But in June , that shifted to a lower - case " g , " in about the same shade of blue but without any background .
Why ?
In a blog post , Google vice president Marissa Mayer and web designer Micheal Lopez explained :
The reason is that we wanted to develop a set of icons that would scale better to some new platforms like the iPhone and other mobile devices .
So the new favicon is one of those , but we 've also developed a group of logo - based icons that all hang together as a unified set .
Now things have changed yet again -- the lower - case g has gone in for a paint job .
It now appears in white inside a set of color fields matching the red , yellow , green and blue of the characters in Google 's logo .
( The graphic at right includes blown - up examples of the old and new icons . )
Why another change ?
Google 's Mayer and Lopez posted a new item on its blog , saying that it responded to all the people who sent in new favicon ideas after its last change :
We were impressed by the volume of submissions we received , and today we are happy to introduce a new Google favicon inspired by those submissions by our users .
Much as I hate to critique a choice as personal as one 's online heraldry , this new icon just does n't do much for me .
It 's too loud , and the outlined " g " drowns too easily between those colored icebergs .
( Note that in the winning submission , the " g " appears at the center of the icon , but Google then elected to shift it to the left . )
And if the color fields remind me of anything , it 's South Africa 's flag , not Google -- which , after all , does n't have any blocks of color in its logo , just a series of letters .
I 'm not the only one disappointed by the change ; see , for instance , the skeptical reaction at the Google Operating System blog .
How about you ?
Does this change bug you at all ?
Or had you not noticed it until reading this post ?

How many patients have been harmed by antipsychotic drugs ?
Do something about it !
Authors ' Quotes on Diabetes and Antipsychotics
Sources for this story include :
( Natural News ) Drug maker AstraZeneca , seller of theantipsychotic drug , suppressed clinical studies showing its drug significantly increased the risk of diabetes , say internal e-mails .
As Bloomberg is reporting today ( http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601... ) , employee emails that were unsealed as part of a lawsuit reveal AstraZeneca deliberately hid at least three studies that established a significant link between itsdrug and the onset of diabetes in patients .
This fact was blatantly admitted in a 1999 e-mail sent by an AstraZeneca official .
The Wall Street Journal is also reporting today that " AstraZeneca instructed its U.S. sales representatives to tell doctors that its powerful psychiatric drug , Seroquel , did n't cause diabetes even though a company physician had at one point stated years earlier that such a link was probable in some individuals . "
( http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123570604586...
Today , AstraZeneca remains in spin control , once again apparently lying about its past behavior by saying , " None of the documents can obscure the fact that AstraZeneca acted responsibly and appropriately as it developed and marketed Seroquel . " ( spokesperson Tony Jewell , reported in Bloomberg.com ) AstraZeneca currently faces over 9,000 lawsuits over Seroquel , involving more than 15,000 people who say the company lied about the diabetes risks of taking the drug .
It is well known in the natural health industry that antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs disrupt blood sugar metabolism and promote diabetes , but drug companies and the FDA have seemingly conspired to prevent the public from learning this fact ( the FDA routinely approves drugs like Seroquel by trusting the clinical trial data provided by the very same company selling the drug ! ) .
What AstraZeneca did with suppressing some clinical trials while highlighting others is called " cherry picking " the study data .
It 's a red flag that scientific fraud is underway , and no self - respecting scientist would ever support any conclusion derived from clinical trials that were selected in this manner .
Cherry picking the science is a routine practice at drug companies :
They might commission ten ( or so ) studies on their drug , compile the results , then throw out all the studies showing their drug to be dangerous or deadly .
The rest of the studies -- which magically show the drug to be safe and effective -- are then forwarded to the FDA for " review . "
The FDA , which conducts no scientific studies on its own , completely trusts the drug trials funded by the drug company , so it declares the drug to be " safe and effective " and gives it the stamp of approval for nationwide consumption .
This is how drugs get approved in America today .
It is laughingly called the " gold standard of evidence - based medicine " by drug pushers and FDA bureaucrats .
Anyone familiar with this process , however , realizesand has nothing whatsoever to do with rigorous science or consumer safety ( but it has everything to do with profits ) .
There 's no telling exactly how many patients have become diabetic or obese thanks to Big Pharma 's dangerous drugs .
The drug companies , of course , refuse to admit their drugs have caused even a single case of diabetes , and the FDA -- always in bed with Big Pharma -- continues to defend the scientific fraud demonstrated here by AstraZeneca .
In a reasonable world , , and the company should be banned from selling drugs in the United States for a minimum of three years .
But the FDA does nothing .
Scientific fraud is no concern at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ... it 's business as usual !
Can you imagine the outcry if a vitamin were found to cause diabetes ?
The FDA would go crazy over the story and probably try to ban the vitamin .
Or what if an herb were discovered to cause diabetes and the herb manufacturer knew it but lied about it ?
The FDA would ban it and outlaw its importation into the United States .
Have you noticed all the outcry over Peanut Corp . and the fact that itits peanut butter was contaminated but sold it anyway ?
Practically the whole country went nuts over the peanut story , accusing the company of endangering the safety of consumers ( which it clearly did ) .
Many tens of millions of products were recalled and people lost their jobs .
But get this :
When Big Pharma knowingly sells a dangerous product and gets caught , Nobody loses their jobs .
No products are recalled .
The FDA remains utterly silent .
Nobody gets prosecuted .
No investigations .
Just complete silence .
Why is selling dangerous peanut butter a crime but selling dangerous pharmaceuticals is openly tolerated by virtually everyone ?
What 's wrong with this picture ?
Truth is , it 's just another day in the corrupt pharmaceutical industry .
Business as usual for Big Pharma and the FDA .

Only a little over half ( 59 % ) were aware that these drugs cause weight gain .

In this case , a joint report by the AmericanAssociation , American Psychiatric Association , American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists , and the North American Association for the study of Obesity complained that an entire class ofdrugs increases the risk of .
Take the drugs for your head , and lose your pancreas .
Although confirmatory research is still needed , a body of evidence from published peer - reviewed epidemiology research suggests that Risperdal is not associated with an increased risk ofwhen compared to untreated patients or patients treated with conventional .
Evidence also suggests that Risperdal is associated with a lower risk ofthan some other studied atypical .
In other words , the DHCP letter sent to physicians and the package inserts that come with their drug have very contradictory statements .
In addition , the risk of side effects likeand lipid elevations is greater for older patients using these powerful drugs .
The FDA recently warned that the use of atypicalmedication doubles the risk of death in the elderly .
In some cases Alzheimer 's patients can experience symptoms of aggression , hallucinations , delusions , disorganized thoughts , and bizarre behavior , all of which may be treatable withmedications .
However , medications should only be used for Alzheimer 's patients who are psychotic .
If possible , try to address theagents first because they pose severe risks including tardive dyskinesia and potentially lethal neuroleptic malignant syndrome , , and pancreatitis .
However , if theexposure has lasted for several years , it may take many months to withdraw , and therefore it becomes more practical to start with another drug that 's easier to stop .
But keep in mind that your risk of getting tardive dyskinesia fromdrugs is high and that the risk increases over time , so it 's a good idea to withdraw from these drugs as soon as possible .
On June 15,2005 , the company settled a multicase product - liability suit for 690 million dollars involving life - threateningassociated with its relatively newdrug Zyprexa .

To put this cost in perspective : all the cancers together in United States cost about $ 171 billion a year .
We have a major epidemic , and we are only making the problem worse .
There are many secondary causes to this pandemic .
Some doctors are a little concerned , as increasing numbers of children are givendrugs for anxiety and conditions like autism .
This is because these drugs can promote weight gain and therefore elevate the risk of These medications have not , however , been without their own problems :
They can interfere with glucose metabolism , increasing the tendency to develop adult - onset ( type 2 ) and in rare cases ketoacidosis; 19 they also increase lipids and cause weight gain , all of which can increase the risk of heart disease .
Use of olanzepine , Clozaril , risperidal , and the atypicalhas been associated with an increase inbut less so with risperidal .
There are conflicting results for quetiapine .
The atypicals can cause substantial weight gain , disruptions in blood sugar control , and even .
Nutrients depleted : Chlorpromazine , fluphenazine , and thiorizadine deplete CoQ10 , melatonin , and vitamin B2 ; haloperidol depletes CoQ10 .
Although there 's not as much information on depletions with the newer atypical medicines , their mode of action and side - effect profiles are similar enough to expect that they will deplete the same nutrients as the older , typicalNeeded supplements : CoQ10 : 30 - 100 mg daily .
More than 90 percent of those prescriptions ( all of them off label ) were for the atypical , newer versions of the drugs that may cause serious side effects , such as rapid weight gain , , and a movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia .

Any sign ofor pancreatitis while taking the newerdrugs requires the immediate withdrawal of the drugs .
A new heart arrhythmia or other heart problem while taking almost any psychiatric drug , including stimulants , can be life threatening and requires immediate intervention .
A seizure , serious rash , headache , gastrointestinal problem , liver disorder , joint or muscle pain , abnormal bleeding , or treatment - resistant infection while taking almost any psychiatric drug is another signal for an immediate evaluation and may require cessation of the medication .
Obesity is now considered the main risk factor for most chronic diseases , including heart disease , cancer , and .
Some commondrugs such as olanzapine ( Zyprexa ) can bring about a weight gain of 30 pounds in a short period of time .
These drugs boost dopamine , the hormone that causes food cravings .
This class of drugs also decreases levels of leptin , a protein that suppresses appetite .
In other words , those who take antidepressants may develop an unnaturally strong appetite that they cannot control by eating more .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon said on Tuesday that 61 former detainees from its military prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , appear to have returned to terrorism since their release from custody .

Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said 18 former detainees are confirmed as “ returning to the fight ” and 43 are suspected of having done in a report issued late in December by the Defense Intelligence Agency .
Morrell declined to provide details such as the identity of the former detainees , why and where they were released or what actions they have taken since leaving U.S. custody .
“ This is acts of terrorism .
It could be Iraq , Afghanistan , it could be acts of terrorism around the world , ” he told reporters .
Morrell said the latest figures , current through December 24 , showed an 11 percent recidivism rate , up from 7 percent in a March 2008 report that counted 37 former detainees as suspected or confirmed active militants .
Rights advocates said the lack of details should call the Pentagon ’s assertions into question .
“ Until enough information is provided to allow the press and the public to verify these claims , they need to be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism , ” said Jennifer Daskal , a Washington - based lawyer for Human Rights Watch .
Rights advocates contend that many Guantanamo detainees have never taken up arms against the United States and say the Defense Department in the past has described former detainees as rejoining “ the fight ” because they spoke out against the U.S. government .
“ The Defense Department sees that the Guantanamo detention operation has failed and they are trying to launch another fear mongering campaign to justify the indefinite detention of detainees there , ” said Jamil Dakwar , human rights director at the American Civil Liberties Union .
President - elect Barack Obama , who takes office next Tuesday , is expected to issue an executive order to close the Guantanamo Bay prison .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates also favors shuttering Guantanamo .
But the prison is unlikely to shut until after U.S. officials settle a myriad of legal and logistic issues , including a solution on where to house its occupants .
About 255 men are still held at the U.S. - run naval base in Cuba , a symbol of aggressive interrogation methods that exposed the United States to allegations of torture .
Pentagon officials say that about 110 detainees should never be released because of the potential danger they pose to U.S. interests .
Washington has cleared 50 of the detainees for release but cannot return them to their home countries because of the risk they would be tortured or persecuted there .
The Pentagon said it considers a former detainee ’s return to terrorism “ confirmed ” when evidence shows direct involvement in terrorist activities .
U.S. officials see a “ suspected ” terrorism links when intelligence shows a plausible link with terrorist activities .
“ Propaganda does not qualify as a terrorist activity , ” the Pentagon said in a statement .
In his election - night victory speech , Barack Obama said he would be a president for all Americans , not just those who voted for him .
But as a candidate he did n't campaign with equal vigor for every vote .
Instead , he and John McCain devoted more than 98 % of their television ad spending and campaign events to just 15 states which together make up about a third of the U.S. population .
Today , as the Electoral College votes are cast and counted state - by - state , we will be reminded why .
It is the peculiar mechanics of that institution , designed for a different age , that leave us divided into red states , blue states and swing states .
That needs to change .
The Electoral College was created in 1787 by a constitutional convention whose delegates were unconvinced that the election of the president could be entrusted to an unfiltered vote of the people , and were concerned about the division of power among the 13 states .
It was antidemocratic by design .
Under the system , each state receives votes equal to the number of representatives it has in the House plus one for each of its senators .
Less populated states are thus overrepresented .
While this formula has n't changed , it no longer makes a difference for the majority of states .
Wyoming , with its three electoral votes , has no more influence over the selection of the president or on the positions taken by candidates than it would with one vote .
We often forget that the power to appoint electors is given to state legislatures , and it is only because they choose to hold a vote that Election Day is at all relevant for us .
Nowhere is a popular election constitutionally required .
And , as the 2000 election reminded us , the winner of the popular vote is not guaranteed to become president .
The Constitution is no longer in line with our expectations regarding the role of the people in selecting the president .
Yet several previous attempts to eliminate the Electoral College through a constitutional amendment have failed , scuttled by the difficulty of the process itself and the tyranny of small - state logic .
Another Newspaper Down : Hearst About to Pull the Plug on Seattle ’s Post - Intelligencer
Anyone in Seattle want to buy a money - losing hometown paper ?
If not , owner Hearst says it will either turn the Seattle Post - Intelligencer into an online - only pub with a skeleton staff or just shut it down altogether .
Bet on the latter .
Here ’s the paper ’s own report on its impending demise :
The Seattle P - I is being put up for sale , and if after 60 days it has not sold , it will either be turned into a Web - only publication with a greatly reduced staff or discontinued entirely .
‘ One thing is clear : at the end of the sale process , we do not see ourselves publishing in print , ’ said Steven Swartz , president of the Hearst Corp . ’s newspaper division .
Swartz addressed the P - I ’s newsroom at about noon Friday , flanked by P - I editor and publisher Roger Oglesby and Lincoln Millstein , Hearst ’s senior vice president for digital media .
Swartz said the reason for offering the paper for sale is purely economic .
‘ Since 2000 , the P - I has lost money each year , and the losses have escalated and continue to escalate in 2009 , ’ he said .
‘ We have had to make a very tough decision .
This is a business decision and it is no reflection on your work .
The decision reflects our inability to see the losses turning around soon . ’
In a release circulated shortly after Swartz finished speaking , Hearst said the P - I lost about $ 14 million in 2008 . ”
And here ’s a reaction from John Cook , a P - I veteran who left the paper last year to start up Tech Flash , a tech / biz blog he runs with fellow refugee Todd Bishop :
Could this be its final dance ?
It ’s too early to say .
The bigger questions are whether Hearst is doing some behind - the - scenes dealing , and whether the P - I could sustain itself as an online - only operation .
Obviously , we ’re big believers in the power of online media .
We know it is still an experiment in many ways , but given the rocky state of the daily newspaper business , we ’ve always asked ourselves : ‘ What ’s to lose ? ’
Anyway , we do n’t think the last chapter has been written in this story .
The timing is truly bizarre .
What the P - I needs now is a white knight to emerge from the Seattle tech community .
A savior .
Someone with gobs of money who does n’t mind losing some of it .
What ’s Paul Allen doing these days ? ”
To answer John ’s question about the paper ’s ability to sustain itself as an online - only offering :
It can’t .
Quantcast pegs the paper ’s traffic at 2.6 million uniques .
That would keep a blog with a handful of writers and editors afloat–if it had a specific niche , like , say technology news .
And if it had a national audience to sell to advertisers .
But a generalized news site for a local audience ?
No one ’s figured out how to do it yet , and a recession probably is n’t the time to solve that riddle .
It ’s hard to see how the paper stays afloat without a white knight .
And it ’s hard to see how this wo n’t play out in cities across the country over the next few years .

Investigating the persistent , evidence - free assumptions that the Iranian government is involved in some untoward effort to produce something nuclear weapons related , the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) revealed today that Iran has purchased tungsten copper , and has been prevented from receiving a shipment of aluminum sheets .
The journal reports that tungsten copper could be used in a “ missile guidance system , ” and to the extent that the ubiquitous alloy is used as a contact material in many electronics they are technically correct .
However , as it is commonly used in any number of industries it seems hard to conclude , as the WSJ suggests , that Iran is trying to build long - range nuclear missiles .
The United Arab Emirates also apparently prevented Iran from acquiring aluminum sheets , with the implication that they might be used in missiles .
Again , it seems hard to argue that the corrosion - resistant metal is not hypothetically usable as one of the components of a missile .
Yet as the world ’s second most widely used metal ( second only to iron ) it too seems far short of proof of insidious intent .
Yet for a nation like Iran , even the acquisition of two extremely common industrial metals is seen as damning evidence .
In 2009 , the smoking gun is n’t a mushroom cloud , its an ingot of copper .
Though President Bush remains in office for only two more weeks , he has left a final trail of devastation to cement his legacy in place .
From gutting the endangered species act to allowing toxic waste to flow freely , Bush is pushing 11th hour executive orders at a potentially record setting pace .
His list of last minute domestic atrocities is not limited to the environment , but many of his most egregious final offenses are those that spoil sensitive habitat and natural resources .
This list is merely a sample of Bush ’s midnight regulations , along with what is being done to stop him .
Here are George Bush ’s top five most disgraceful efforts to ruin our environment once more .
5 ) Actual pine woods to be replaced with a suburb named “ Pine Woods ” .
Plum Creek Timber , the nation ’s largest private landowner , has crafted a back door deal with the Bush administration to allow them to pave over logging roads and develop the previously inaccessible land .
Local forest agencies are furious about the back door deal , which is being finalized this week .
It might not be too late to stop it , so call 1-800 - 832-1355 and tell Forest Service director ( and former timber industry lobbyist ) to stop opening up our forests for development .

4 ) No need to report hazardous waste and air pollutants .
The EPA has allowed over 100,000 tons of waste to be exempted from the hazardous waste controls and is no longer requiring factory farms to report toxic air pollutants such as ammonia because “ there ’s no way our responders can deal with that ” .
But is n’t that the point of the EPA ?
Unfortunately , these have already been signed and there are no lawsuits yet to overturn them .
3 ) Mining waste can be dumped in streams and rivers .
The 25 year ban on dumping mining waste within 100 of streams and rivers no longer exists , thanks to one of Bush ’s deregulations early in December .
This is opposed by prominent politicians in the states with the most mining , as well as conservation groups , but the effort to stop the deregulation failed .
There is a lawsuit underway currently , so hopefully the ban will be reinstated soon .
2 ) Oil - shale industry in the Rocky Mountain states gets the green light .
Bush and the Land Management Bureau have given the okay for oil production companies to go ahead with exploration without even considering the effects it would have on animals and plants listed as threatened by the Endangered Species Act .
Oil - shale development , which obtains oil from rocks around surface level , is a polluting process that can endanger nearby wildlife .
A lawsuit is being filed by at least a dozen conservation groups .
1 ) Endangered Species
Act no longer required to use science ?
In conjunction with all of these deregulations , some are claiming that Bush ’s new rules have gutted the ESA so badly that it is no longer necessary to use scientific reviews when enacting a potentially devastating policy or endeavor .
California Attorney General Jerry Brown is having his entire state sue the Bush administration , claiming that a new regulation “ circumvents a time - tested statute that for 35 years has required scientific review of proposed federal agency decisions that affect wildlife . ”
Considering only Congress can change the ESA , we may be able to count on success in overturning this most offensive deregulation by President Bush .
For the sake of the world ’s future generations , let us all hope that the incoming administration stays true to its promise to make the environment a top priority .

Irish economists may be wringing their hands in despair but a leading US expert believes the Republic 's economy will bounce back and " lead Europe within a decade " .
Dr Robert E Kennedy thinks the Irish Republic will outperform its European rivals once again within the space of 10 years .
He predicted that the country will enjoy growth rates of around 3 pc and he would put " big money " on Ireland doing better than larger countries like Germany and France .
The former adviser to the US government and head of business administration at the University of Michigan makes his optimistic predictions in a new book on outsourcing in the global economy .
He does , however , warn that the country must accept that assembly - line manufacturing will leave the country for eastern Europe and other labour markets .
This will happen because the Republic has very high labour costs compared to central and eastern Europe .
He calculated that the average wage if you divide GDP by population in Ireland is around € 37,000 , while in Poland it is just € 8,190 .
" So , in terms of low - skilled jobs involving physically assembling computer parts , Ireland can't compete , " he said .
" However , where Ireland has an edge is in its highly skilled , educated workforce .
Dell , for instance , is keeping most of its service and administrative base in Ireland . "

MPs are to consider plans to introduce secret coroner 's inquests later today .
The coroners and justice bill contains plans originally included in last year 's Counter Terrorism
Act which would make some inquests where national security is judged to be under threat held out of the public eye .
Civil liberties groups have expressed deep concern about the proposals , which could see relatives , juries and the press excluded .
Amnesty International UK 's campaigns director Tim Hancock said : " When someone has lost their life at the hands of the state , it 's essential - and required by international law - that an independent and impartial inquiry finds out how and why it happened .
" Coroners can already decide - independently - to exclude the public from part of an inquest on grounds of national security .
" Letting the government make this decision will lead to accusations of cover-ups and could deny both the public and the victim 's family their right to know what happened . "
Many believe the inquest into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes - who was shot dead after being mistaken as a terror suspect on a London Underground station in July 2005 - would have been held in private had the legislation already been passed .

BEIRUT , Lebanon ( CNN ) -- Lebanon 's prime minister condemned the firing of rockets into northern Israel after an attack wounded two Israelis on Thursday .
He said his government is trying to determine who was responsible .
U.N. soldiers on Thursday inspect the site in Lebanon thought to be the source of rockets fired into Israel .
Israel 's military warned Israeli civilians to stick close to shelters after police said at least four rockets hit near the city of Nahariya , about 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) south of the Lebanese border .
The Israeli military said it returned fire across the border with mortars .
Schools and kindergartens were closed in Nahariya and the nearby town of Shlomi , the Israel Defense Forces reported .
" What happened in the south [ of Lebanon ] is a violation of Resolution 1701 and is rejected by Lebanon , " Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said , referring to the U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon 's Hezbollah militia .
In a statement issued by his office , Siniora said he has asked Lebanese authorities to investigate the attack alongside troops from the U.N. peacekeeping force deployed along the border .
He also condemned the Israeli retaliatory strikes , which the Lebanese military said inflicted no casualties .
Watch CNN 's Christiane Amanpour discuss rocket attack »
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks , which came as Israeli airstrikes on Gaza , to the south , entered a 13th day .
The Israeli campaign in Gaza is aimed at halting rocket fire from the Hamas - ruled Palestinian territory .
Israel fought a similar battle against the Lebanese Shiite Muslim militia Hezbollah in 2006 , during which Hezbollah rained rockets on cities in Israeli 's north for a month before a cease - fire was reached .
But Hezbollah has kept a tight rein on its forces in southern Lebanon since the cease - fire , and a number of Palestinian factions operate in southern Lebanon as well .
Andrea Tenenti , a spokesman for UNIFIL , the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon , said the rockets appear to have been fired from a point about 4.5 miles east of Naqoura , where the peacekeepers are headquartered .
" We 've been intensifying our patrols on the ground in order to prevent any further incident , " Tenenti said .
He said UNIFIL 's commander , Maj. Gen. Claudio Graziano , is in " constant and close contact " with both sides " and has urged maximum restraint in order to prevent any escalation of the situation . "
CNN 's Michal Zippori in Jerusalem and Cal Perry and Nada Husseini in Beirut contributed to this report .

City Councilman Ed Reyes introduced a motion Friday calling on Los Angeles city departments to come up with ways to routinely evaluate structural problems of old apartment buildings .
The action follows the partial collapse Sunday of an apartment building in Reyes ’ district .
The building had passed a Housing Department inspection within the last year .
The department said its inspectors are not trained to assess the structural integrity of the buildings they examine .

Russia is ready to abandon plans for a wholesale renewal of its nuclear missile arsenal if the United States stops deployment of a controversial missile shield , a Russian general said Friday .
The comments by the commander of Russia ’s strategic missile forces came amid increasing verbal exchanges between the two sides over missile defence ahead of the inauguration of Barack Obama as US president on January 20 .
“ If the Americans give up their plans to deploy the third position area and other elements of strategic missile defence , then undoubtedly we will respond in kind , ” said General Nikolai Solovtsov , quoted by Interfax news agency .
“ And an array of programmes , expensive programmes , will simply not be necessary for us , ” he added .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The term “ third position area ” refers to planned US missile defence facilities in Eastern Europe that have aroused a furious reaction from Russia .
“ Today we do not have ideological reasons for confrontation .
And as we realise plans for the development of the strategic missile forces , we are not planning to frighten anyone , ” Solovtsov said .

Published reports indicate that the St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Padres have agreed on a trade bringing Khalil Greene to St. Louis for two relievers .
The names of the relievers have not been published and I , as well as many other Redbird fans , are very curious to find out who the relievers are .
Khalil Greene is apparently owed 6.5 million in 2009 and will be a free agent at the end of the season .
Again , the full details of this trade have not been released yet so we are unsure if the Cards are on the hook for the full $ 6.5 million or if the Padres have agreed to eat some of this money .
Greene had a breakout year in 2007 , cranking 27 HR ’s and driving in 97 RBI ’s , while playing a very smooth shortstop .
Greene stru ggled at the plate in 2008 , though , as experts feel he was consumed with trying to hit the long ball .
Khalil only hit .213 in 2008 with 10 HR ’s and 35 RBI ’s through 105 games .
His season was cut short July 31st as he broke his hand after apparently punching a storage unit .
Reports show that Khalil Greene had a falling out with the Padres front office and it has been rumored for a while now that they were wanting to move him , whether just to get rid of his salary or turn the page with someone else .
I am sure the Cardinals are hoping that a change of scenery will help Greene return to his ’ 07 form .
Khalil Greene has performed better away from pitcher - friendly Petco park over his years there , to the tune of a .270 BA and 50 HR ’s versus .255 and 30 HR ’s at Petco .
When the details of this deal are finally released we will be able to truly decide if the Cards have made a smart move here .
Hopefully they have ’nt given up some top name prospects and likewise , hopefully Greene can return to being the electric , smooth , power hitting shortstop that helped him make a name for himself .
I will say it ’s nice to actually see the Cards doing something .
They have made some moves over the past couple of years but not necessarily what a lot of fans were hoping for .
Again , that ’s why we ’re fans and not management .
The Cards continue to compete and hopefully with a few more strong moves this off season the Cards can climb back to the top of the Central .

On Saturday , two of the greatest pound - for - pound fighters of all time , BJ Penn and Georges St - Pierre , will go toe - to - toe the second - time in UFC 94 .
Fortunately , the fight card for UFC 94 is nothing similar to the last mediocre event .
This sold - out event offers a lot of interesting fights that ’s going to keep your butt off the seat .
Georges “ Rush ” St - Pierre vs. BJ “ The Prodigy ” Penn
After BJ lost a close split decision to GSP in 2006 , a rematch was inevitable .
If anyone still remembers the fight , BJ decisively won the first half of the fight , but lost the second half after his bad conditioning kicked in .
That same night , “ The Prodigy ” did n’t get a scratch on his face , but GSP ’s face was bleeding so bad that he had to spend a night in the hospital .
Granted , both fighters had flaws at the time ( For BJ , it was his cardio and the will to conquer , and for GSP , it was his youth ) , but the two are no longer the same fighters as three years ago , with BJ and GSP both dominate the lightweight and welterweight divisions respectively .
Let ’s first talk about GSP .
For someone who has accomplished so much , it ’s hard to believe that GSP is only 27 years old .
A classy French - Canadian gentleman who has a tremendous heart , well - rounded techniques , focused mindset , and eagerness to improve .
A very strong welterweight that many believe he will hold the belt until the day he quits .
So talented that he can even challenge the likes of Anderson Silva in the middleweight division .
A man who is now so perfect in all aspects , who can be defeated by only himself ( like what he did to himself in his first title defense against Matt Serra ) .
But I ’m more of a fan of BJ Penn .
Everyone respects this man and love to hate him at the same time .
He ’s a trash talker , and his ego is not measurable .
A little guy who was so confident in himself that he would abandon his UFC welterweight title to take on other new challenges in Japan .
Throughout his career , he ’s fought across weight classes , believing that his skills and will alone can overcome the size differences .
At one point , he even moved up to light heavyweight and challenged Ryoto Machida with huge weight disadvantage .
Despite all the crazyness about BJ Penn , his legacy and raw - talent are undeniable .
Like Dana
White mentioned in an interview , “ The Prodigy ” definitely has all the skills and toughness in the world to fight anyone , but his body frame is not built to fight beyond the lightweight division , which I totally agree .
In the past , we ’d witnessed BJ ’s fatique when he took on larger opponents .
GSP is no small guy , and he ’ll have to cut weight in order to fight BJ .
After the official weigh - in , expect GSP to jump right back up to 185 lbs range .
There had been accusations of BJ being too laid back because of his cardio problem in the past , but this will never be a problem as long as he stays in lightweight , where he ’s forced to work hard to lose the weight .
No matter how skilled BJ is , I still do n’t believe he can last five rounds with a much heavier and stronger , but also a tough opponent like GSP .
And knowing that BJ is not the type to be finished easily , my pick is GSP by unanimous decision .
After all , I ’m sure this outcome is what the UFC wants because a single fighter defending two titles is never good for the business and challengers waiting in line .
A fighter usually fights no more than three times a year .
Can you imagine how many title fights we are going to be able to watch this year if BJ has two belts around his waist ?

Ryoto “ Lyoto ” Machida vs Thiago Silva
Two great fighters , both undefeated , but only one will retain a perfect record after the night .
Silva is a powerful and aggressive fighter , who also has excellent jiu - jitsu and good ground - and - pound .
Machida on the other hand is a very technical but passive fighter , whose awkward karate fighting style has confused so many of his opponents in the past .
But no matter how many more people doubt Machida ’s ability , my money is still on him .
For someone who had defeated BJ Penn ( although by decision ) , Rich Franklin , Stephan Bonnar , and Tito Ortiz in the past has nothing left to prove .
But expect a great fight because with Silva ’s aggressiveness pressing forward , we ’ll see “ Lyoto ” stay busy in the entire fight .
[ poll id = ” 16 ″ ]
Nate Diaz vs Clay “ The Carpenter ” Guida
Can you believe a guy like Guida who has had 33 professional fights is just as young as GSP ?
The guy had nine losses so far , but for someone who used to fight literally ten times a year , you simply can’t blame him for it .
There should be no questions on Guida ’s ability , as we ’ve all witnessed his aggressiveness and wrestling skills in his past fights , especially in his fight with Roger Huerta .
Now , the brother of Nick Diaz , Nate , is a young and pissed off fighter , who has n’t lost a fight since he won the Ultimate Fighter Season 5 , will finally face his toughest challenge to date .
Submitting a wild man like Guida will definitely help Diaz rise to superstardom , but this is going to be tough , very tough .
I can only picture this happening if Guida makes a mistake and Diaz finds an opening .
My pick is Guida by TKO .
[ poll id = ” 17 ″ ]
Stephan “ The American Psycho ” Bonnar vs Jon “ Bones ” Jones
Forgive my ignorance in the sport because I ’ve never heard of Jon Jones .
Due to this reason , I ’m going to pick the one that I ’m much more familiar of ( i.e. Stephan Bonnar ) .
Karo “ The Heat ” Parisyan vs Dong Hyun Kim
After a devastating lost to Thiago Alves , Parisyan has a lot to carry on his back for this fight .
This Saturday , he ’ll face the undefeated , up and coming Korean fighter , Dong - Hyun Kim .
Many Americans may not be familiar with Kim , but he ’d defeated a good number of Japanese fighters in impressive fashion .
Of course , none of the fighters that Kim had fought was close to Parisyan ’s level .
This fight will be a good test for both fighters .
My pick is Karo Parisyan by unanimous decision .
Jon Fitch vs Akihiro Gono
Ah !
Someone please explain this to me .
We have Jon Fitch fighting Akihiro Gono on the preliminary card and may not even be broadcast .
Say What ?
Jon
Fitch has only lost to GSP in the UFC is now being disposed as a filler fighter .
Akihiro Gono , a long time MMA veteran and a superstar in Pride is also being mistreated over here .
I ’d much rather want to see this fight than the Parisyan vs. Kim one .
Jon Fitch by TKO .
What did Australian author Harry Nicolaides write which so offended the Thai government and caused them to jail him for lese majeste ?
Thanks to the Streisand effect , the relevant excerpt is now available on WikiLeaks :
From King Rama to the Crown Prince , the nobility was renowned for their romantic entanglements and intrigues .
The Crown Prince had many wives " major and minor " with a coterie of concubines for entertainment .
One of his recent wives was exiled with her entire family , including a son they conceived together , for an undisclosed indiscretion .
He subsequently remarried with another woman and fathered another child .
It was rumored that if the prince fell in love with one of his minor wives and she betrayed him , she and her family would disappear with their name , familial lineage and all vestiges of their existence expunged forever .
( The entire novel is also available here [ PDF ] .
Given that it only sold seven copies , I do n't think anyone is going to be losing money over it ...)
So , basically establishing that the ( fictional ) Crown Prince has absolute power and uses it in his self - interest .
You can see how the Thai government ( who through the monarch have absolute power and use it in their self - interest ) might be upset by that - but the fact remains that in a democratic society , nothing is held sacred , and you are allowed to say these sorts of things .
Unfortunately , as we 've seen in recent years , and in recent use of the lese majeste law , Thailand is n't really a democratic society ...

While the importance of earning a college degree to secure a good job has been engrained in our brains for as long we can remember , a four - year degree is not the only path to a successful career .
Not all well - paying jobs require a college education .
Schooling is a great way to develop skills and will no doubt enhance your credibility .
But a college education is no longer a requirement to securing a well - paying salary .
Despite the fact that college graduates earn an average of $ 1 million more than high school graduates during their careers , according to the U.S. Census Bureau , it is possible to land a lucrative position without attending college .
Workers with a high school education or less have an abundance of positions open to them .
In 2006 , 66 million jobs -- about 44 percent of the total -- were available to workers with less than a high school education , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
By 2016 , there are expected to be 71 million jobs available to these workers .

Small electric prods wo n’t be used to get balky broncos to bolt and buck at the National Western rodeo after an anti-animal - abuse group complained last year about their use .
The contractor that provides rodeo stock at the National Western — which begins Saturday and runs through Jan. 25 — has been told not to bring horses to the rodeo that have been known to stall in chutes .
The electric devices “ were used appropriately last year , ” said state veterinarian Dr. Keith Roehr .
The National Western ’s animal care and use committee decided to limit the prods ’ use , Roehr said , to allay public concern .
“ That ’s outstanding .
It ’s a step in the right direction , ” said Steve Hindi , president of SHARK — Showing Animals Respect & Kindness .
The Geneva , Ill . - based group recorded video last year at three National Western rodeos that shows several saddle broncs being jolted out of the chute .
“ We ’ll probably never be rodeo supporters , but I have to hand it to them .
They have taken a significant step , ” Hindi said .
Denver Animal Control ’s investigation of last year ’s allegations found no evidence the horses suffered .
About the size of a cellphone , the prods are powered with 9 - volt batteries and deliver a shock that is about what a horse would receive from an electric fence .
The prod may be used only if a horse stalls in the chute , a situation that can pose a risk to horse and rider , said the Pro Rodeo Cowboys Association .
“ They encourage the horses to move , but it does n’t hurt them , ” said Cindy Schonholtz , a PRCA spokeswoman .
Schonholtz said the PRCA works with local committees , such as the National Western ’s , to determine what works best for their communities .
Other rodeos , including Cheyenne Frontier Days and the Greeley Stampede , recently imposed the same no -shock policy .
Pat Grant , president and chief executive of the National Western , said in a statement : “ We remain committed to continue as industry leaders in animal welfare with new policies in place at the 2009 National Western Rodeo that will focus on much restricted use of electric prods and stronger fines for jerk - downs in the tie - down roping . ”
Jerk - downs are when a contestant jerks a calf backward when it ’s being roped .
For safety reasons , one electric prod will be available to one authorized person in case of emergency .
Binion Cervi , whose Cervi Championship Rodeo outfit supplies the National Western ’s bucking stock , said he has no issue with the new policy .
“ Everything looks good , ” Cervi said .
“ We have plenty of horses , and it should n’t have any impact . ”

How does a 3.5 % down payment on a house with a 3.99 % fixed - rate mortgage sound ?
This kind of thing was unheard of a year ago , but now East Coast builder Toll Brothers is offering buyers a tintillating deal .
The Wall Street Journal ’s Dawn Wotapka reports :
Horsham , Penn. - based
Toll this week started offering a 3.99 % fixed mortgage rate for loans $ 417,000 or below for 30 years with no points , one of — if not the — industry ’s lowest rates , one well below the national average of just below 5 % .
It ’s too early to say if other builders will copy the attention - grabbing rate , but as the market worsens , competition is fierce and this move could launch a scramble to match the rate .
Several builders have said traffic has ticked up as interest rates fall .
For the week ended Jan. 15 , the 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage slipped to an average 4.96 % with an average 0.7 point , according to Freddie Mac .
The rate , which has fallen for 11 consecutive weeks , is the lowest since Freddie Mac began its survey in 1971 .
While lower interest rates — and the smaller monthly payments that result — could lure some buyers off the sidelines , builders still have to contend with competition from bargain - priced foreclosures , buyers ’ fear of falling prices and the rising unemployment rate .
The unemployed , and those worried about their jobs , are simply unlikely to purchase .
Welcome !!!
Hello everyone !
Thanks for coming by my blog .
Writing is a passion of mine along with being a mom , wife and church member .
I hope you like my articles and enjoy my tips , opinions and sense of humor !
Enjoy !

I suspect there 's a Pons Asinorum of probability between the bettor who thinks that you make money on horse races by betting on the horse you think will win , and the bettor who realizes that you can only make money on horse races if you find horses whose odds seem poorly calibrated relative to superior probabilistic guesses .
There is , I think , a second Pons Asinorum associated with more advanced finance , and it is the concept that markets are an anti-inductive environment .
Let 's say you see me flipping a coin .
It is not necessarily a fair coin .
It 's a biased coin , and you do n't know the bias .
I flip the coin nine times , and the coin comes up " heads " each time .
I flip the coin a tenth time .
What is the probability that it comes up heads ?
If you answered " ten-elevenths , by Laplace 's Rule of Succession " , you are a fine scientist in ordinary environments , but you will lose money in finance .
In finance the correct reply is , " Well ... if everyone else also saw the coin coming up heads ... then by now the odds are probably back to fifty - fifty . "
Recently on Hacker News I saw a commenter insisting that stock prices had nowhere to go but down , because the economy was in such awful shape .
If stock prices have nowhere to go but down , and everyone knows it , then trades wo n't clear - remember , for every seller there must be a buyer - until prices have gone down far enough that there is once again a possibility of prices going up .
So you can see the bizarreness of someone saying , " Real estate prices have gone up by 10 % a year for the last N years , and we 've never seen a drop . "
This treats the market like it was the mass of an electron or something .
Markets are anti-inductive .
If , historically , real estate prices have always gone up , they will keep rising until they can go down .
To get an excess return - a return that pays premium interest over the going rate for that level of riskiness - you need to know something that other market participants do n't , or they will rush in and bid up whatever you 're buying ( or bid down whatever you 're selling ) until the returns match prevailing rates .
If the economy is awful and everyone knows it , no one 's going to buy at a price that does n't take into account that knowledge .
If there 's an obvious possibility of prices dropping further , then the market must also believe there 's a probability of prices rising to make up for it , or the trades wo n't clear .
This elementary point has all sorts of caveats I 'm not bothering to include here , like the fact that " up " and " down " is relative to the risk - free interest rate and so on .
Nobody believes the market is really " efficient " , and recent events suggest it is less efficient than previously believed , and I have a certain friend who says it 's even less efficient than that ... but still , the market does not leave hundred - dollar - bills on the table if everyone believes in them .
There was a time when the Dow systematically tended to drop on Friday and rise on Monday , and once this was noticed and published , the effect went away .
Past history , e.g. " real estate prices have always gone up " , is not private info .
And the same also goes for more complicated regularities .
Let 's say two stock prices are historically anticorrelated - the variance in their returns moves in opposite directions .
As soon as everyone believes this , hedge - fund managers will leverage up and buy both stocks .
Everyone will do this , meaning that both stocks will rise .
As the stocks rise , their returns get more expensive .
The hedge - fund managers book profits , though , because their stocks are rising .
Eventually the stock prices rise to the point they can go down .
Once they do , hedge - fund managers who got in late will have to liquidate some of their assets to cover margin calls .
This means that both stock prices will go down - at the same time , even though they were originally anticorrelated .
Other hedge funds may lose money on the same two stocks and also sell or liquidate , driving the price down further , etcetera .
The correlative structure behaves anti-inductively , because other people can observe it too .
If mortage defaults are historically uncorrelated , so that you can get an excess return on risk by buying lots of mortages and pooling them together , then people will rush in and buy lots of mortgages until ( a ) rates on mortgages are bid down ( b ) individual mortgage failure rates rise ( c ) mortgage failure rates become more correlated , possibly looking uncorrelated in the short - term but having more future scenarios where they all fail at once .
Whatever is believed in , stops being real .
The market is literally anti-inductive rather than anti-regular - it's the regularity that enough participants induce , which therefore goes away .
This , as I understand it , is the standard theory of " efficient markets " , which should perhaps have been called " inexploitable markets " or " markets that are not easy to exploit because others are already trying to exploit them " .
Should I have made a mistake thereof , let me be corrected .
Now it 's not surprising , on the one hand , to see this screwed up in random internet discussions where a gold bug argues from well - known observations about the past history of gold .
( This is the equivalent of trying to make money at horse - racing by betting on the horse that you think will win - failing to cross the Pons Asinorum . )
But it is surprising is to hear histories of the financial crisis in which prestigious actors argued in crowded auditoriums that , previously , real - estate prices had always gone up , or that previously mortage defaults had been uncorrelated .
This is naive inductive reasoning of the sort that only works on falling apples and rising suns and human behavior and everything else in the universe except markets .
Should n't everyone have frowned and said , " But is n't the marketplace an anti-inductive environment ? "
Not that this is standard terminology - but perhaps " efficient market " does n't convey quite the same warning as " anti-inductive " .
We would appear to need stronger warnings .
PS : To clarify , the coin example is a humorous exaggeration of what the world would be like if most physical systems behaved the same way as market price movements , illustrating the point , " An exploitable pricing regularity that is easily inducted degrades into inexploitable noise . "
Here the coin coming up " heads " is analogous to getting an above - market return on a publicly traded asset .

Brief recap .
Chip Saltsman , a Tennessee Republican who is seeking the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee , sent a CD of holiday music to committee members earlier this month .
That CD contained a Rush Limbaugh song titled “ Barack the Magic Negro . ” ( Listen here . )
The song is sung by a white political humorist who tries to impersonate the voice of Reverend Al Sharpton .
As Sharpton , the singer complains about Obama being palatable to white people “ because he ’s not from da hood . ”
Saltsman defended the song , saying it is a “ light - hearted political parod[y ] . ”
That got me thinking .
Has any Republican criticized Saltsman for distributing the song ?
Here ’s Mike Allen of Politico , who is stunned to the find the answer is “ no . ”
WHY HAS IT BEEN 18 HOURS SINCE THIS WAS POSTED AND NOT A SINGLE REPUBLICAN OFFICIAL HAS CONDEMNED IT ?
YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE PARTY FIND IT DISGUSTING / ASTONISHING AND CALLED THE LINK TO OUR ATTENTION AS A ‘YA CAN ’T MAKE IT UP . ’
What ’s the motivation here ?
It ’s not that all Republican officials are racist , of course .
I think it has something to do with the fact that conservatives by and large hate political correctness and hate being told by liberals that they stepped over the lines of polite discourse .
I ’ve frequently objected to an insensitive joke , only to be admonished , “ Lighten up , it ’s supposed to be funny . ”
Because , obviously , the fact that there is humorous intent makes the racism / sexism / homophobia okay .
The first Republican official who condemns Saltsman will be the first to bend to the will of the liberal PC Nazis ( i.e. the biggest wimp ) .
And I think that ’s why we are n’t seeing people speaking out , including the African - American candidates in the race for the RNC chair .
If this little episode has enough steam to stick around until after the holidays , top GOPers wo n’t be able to ignore it any longer .
They ’ll have to make a difficult choice .
Sticking to their misguided principles will mean a third week of bad press for the Party .
Update : Conservatives are starting to find their voice(s ) .

Many Palestinian civilians are caught up in the fighting in Gaza
Claims have been received by the BBC and an Israeli human rights group that Israeli troops have fired on Gaza residents trying to escape the conflict area .
Israel has strongly denied the allegations .
BBC journalists in Gaza and Israel have compiled detailed accounts of the claims .
Some Palestinian civilians in Gaza say Israeli forces shot at them as they tried to leave their homes - in some cases bearing white flags .
One testimony heard by the BBC and human rights group B'tselem describes Israeli forces shooting a woman in the head after she stepped out of her house carrying a piece of white cloth , in response to an Israeli loudhailer announcement .
The Israeli military has dismissed the report as " without foundation " .
The BBC has spoken to members of another family who say they are trapped in their home by fighting and have been shot at when they tried to leave to replenish dwindling water and food supplies , even during the three - hour humanitarian lull .
Israel is denying access to Gaza for international journalists and human rights monitors , so it is not possible to verify the accounts .
B'tselem said it had been unable to corroborate the testimony it had received , but felt it should be made public .
' Home destroyed ' Munir Shafik al - Najar , of Khouza village in the south - east of the Gaza Strip , told B'tselem and the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) of a series of events on Monday which he said left four members of his extended family dead .
He told the BBC that some 75 members of his extended family had ended up huddled in a house , surrounded by Israeli forces , after troops shelled the area and destroyed his brother 's home on Sunday night .
On Monday morning , he said the family heard an announcement over a loudspeaker .
" The Israeli army was saying : ' This is the Israeli Defence Forces , we are asking all the people to leave their homes and go to the school .
Ladies first , then men . '
" We decided to send the women first , two by two , " he said .
First to step outside was the wife of his cousin , Rawhiya al - Najar , 48 .
" The army was about 15 metres ( 50 feet ) away from the house or less .
They shot her in the head , " he said .
The woman 's daughter was shot in the thigh but crawled back inside the house , he said .
When we were walking , with the women first , they saw soldiers and they started to shout to them , to tell them ' we have children ' .
They started to shoot us .
My aunt was killed .
Riad Zaki al - Najar
For several hours , the family telephoned the Red Crescent , human rights organisations and Palestinian Authority officials in Ramallah in the hope of co-ordinating safe passage to evacuate people injured in the earlier shelling , Mr Najar said .
Several hours later , no help had arrived .
" We decided that 's it , we 're going to die , we are [ going ] to run and all die at once , " he said .
" When we did that they started shooting with heavy ammunition from a machine gun on top of a tank , " he said .
All the adults carried white flags , he said , adding that he was still grasping a piece of white cloth as he spoke over the telephone a day later .
Three of his relatives , Muhammad Salman al - Najar , 54 , Ahmad Jum 'a al - Najar , 27 , and Khalil Hamdan al - Najar , 80 , were killed , he said .
The troops " knew this man was an old man , " he said , because they were so close .
B'tselem says it is working to corroborate the account .
Similar account A second family member , Riad Zaki al - Najar , gave the BBC a similar account by telephone .
" They told us you all have to go to the centre of the town , where the school is .
" We put the women first , and we put our children on our shoulders , with white bandanas on their heads .
" When we were walking , with the women first , they saw soldiers and they started to shout to them , to tell them 'we have children , we have children ' .
They started to shoot us .
My aunt was killed with a bullet in her head . "
Israel says it tries to protect civilians and blames Hamas for endangering them The BBC also spoke to Marwan Abu Rida , a paramedic with the Palestinian Red Crescent , who says he was called to the site at 0810 local time ( 0610 GMT ) .
But he says he came under fire as he tried to reach it , and was trapped in a house nearby until 2000 ( 1800 GMT ) because of Israeli shooting .
He said that when he reached the location he found the dead woman , Rawhiya , who appeared to have been shot in the head , as well as the younger woman who was injured .
In a written response to the incident , the Israeli military said : " An initial inquiry into the allegation raised by B'tselem has concluded that the claims are without foundation .
" The IDF goes to great lengths to avoid harming Palestinians uninvolved in combat and reiterates that it is Hamas that chooses to launch its attacks against Israeli towns from within civilian areas . "
' Fired upon '
The account bears similarities to another received by B'tselem , from Yusef Abu Hajaj , a resident of Juhar al - Dik , south of Gaza City .
He told B'tselem his mother and sister were shot as they tried to flee their home bearing a white banner , in a group of people including small children .
He said an Israeli tank had fired at their house , and they had heard the Israeli military was urging civilians to leave their homes , so had tried to flee .
The ICRC has repeatedly stressed that it is having difficulty reaching families stranded by the fighting , often including injured people and dead bodies .
Its Gaza spokesman , Iyad Nasser , said ambulance crews were struggling to respond to " tens " of calls from areas they still had not gained sufficient access to .
The head of one such family , Daoud Shtewi , told the BBC by telephone that he and 35 members of his family had been trapped in their home , surrounded by Israeli forces , in Zeitoun , a south - eastern suburb of Gaza City , for 10 days .
If you look from the soldiers ' perspective it 's exceptionally difficult - you do n't know who 's behind that door
IDF spokesman Jacob Dallal " We can't even look through the windows because we get fired on , " Mr Shtewi said .
" We tried to get water from the neighbours because our tanks are running dry .
We are also running out of food and have been without electricity for more than 12 days .
" My mother and father need medicines for high blood pressure and diabetes .
We have run out . "
The area , known to house Palestinian militants , has been the scene of some of the heaviest clashes during Israel 's operation in Gaza .
It is one of several that Palestinian Red Crescent convoys have been struggling to reach .
Three - hour ceasefire
It was also the place where the ICRC said it found four small children who had waited with their dead mothers , apparently with no food or water , for four days last week .
Mr Shtewi said 17 children - aged between six weeks and 15 years , and six women , were in the house in the west of the neighbourhood .
" We have tried to leave the house during the three - hour humanitarian ceasefire , but we got shot at , " he said .
He said the family had repeatedly tried to contact the PRC .
Aid agencies say the Gaza Strip is facing a humanitarian crisis
An ambulance driver with the PRC told the BBC he had received details of a family of 35 people in the location concerned .
But he said it was a closed military zone , that the ambulance workers had not been able to secure co-ordination with the Israeli military to reach it , and were planning to go there as soon as they could secure safe passage with the military .
Israeli military spokesman Jacob Dallal said Hamas was launching rockets from the area in question , and was using civilians ' houses - " exactly these types of homes " - to fire rockets from .
" Especially people who try to move out , those could well be - as they have repeatedly been - Hamas people trying to sneak up and fire on the soldiers .
If you look from the soldiers ' perspective it 's exceptionally difficult - you do n't know who 's behind that door . "
He said that Hamas " specifically uses the lull as a time to fire " , and Israeli forces fire back if they are fired upon during that period .
And he added that the military was working with international agencies to try to facilitate safe passage for ambulances and the transport of aid amid the fighting .

The Missionaries ' Position Get the Book of Mormon Delivered to Your Living Room
Robert Ullman
The Book of Mormon is available for free , and fleets of dashing young men commit up to three years of their lives to delivering it .
So if you want retribution for the Mormon - funded Proposition 8 — the bigoted measure that banned same - sex marriage in California — requesting a copy is one way to burn some Latter - day dough .
If the government wo n't tax the church 's pyramid tithing PAC , at least you can tax its resources .
At Mormon.org , anyone can sign up for a free Book of Mormon .
I thought they 'd mail me a copy .
But when I filled out the form , up popped this message : " Thank you for requesting the Book of Mormon from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
You should be contacted by missionaries in a few days . "
Actual missionaries ?
It sounded too good to be true .
Four days later , my phone rang .
It was Elder Guthrie — he and Elder Leatham would arrive around 6:00 p.m .
And at 6:11 , there they fucking were .
I shook their hands and pointed them to the couch .
" You may have heard about Proposition 8 , " I said .
They nodded .
I told them that the California measure cast uncertainty on the marriage licenses of nearly 20,000 same - sex couples , that Mormon Church leaders directed their congregations to " do all you can to support the ... amendment by donating of your means and time , " resulting in two - thirds of the Prop 8 funding .
The boys stared at their shoes .
They work and live on Capitol Hill , and are dispatched by text message every time some gay guy with a beef orders a book .
But their convictions remain strong .
" When I read the Book of Mormon , it makes me happy , " said wide - eyed Guthrie , writing down passages in suspiciously bubbly handwriting for me to read later .
The Book of Mormon itself is a melodrama .
The passages , printed on pages thin enough to roll into joints , read like Penthouse prose spiked with Shakespearian clichés : " Thy seed also had been as the sand ; the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof .... "
Bowel seed , First Book of Nephi ?
Verily gross .
The 779 - page Book of Mormon , first written in an Egyptian - ish scrawl on gold tablets , was discovered by Joseph Smith in 1823 .
( Nobody has seen these gold tablets since . )
Smith was surely transcribing the word of God directly when reporting that the Jaredites came to the Americas to find " elephants and cureloms and cumoms . "
But the book does n't directly address gay marriage .
When pressed for an example of the harm that same - sex marriages would cause Mormons , Thomas Olson , president of the Mormon 's Seattle North Stake , could n't name one .
He also would n't quote the Book of Mormon .
Instead , he cited the church 's so - called " Proclamation on the Family . "
It declares that " marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator 's plan .... "
Church president Gordon B. Hinckley announced the proclamation on September 23 , 1995 .
In other words , Mormons updated their religion in 1995 , and now that 's what they all believe and you better believe it , too .
" We certainly do n't condone bigotry or targeting gays or lesbians , " says Olson .
" I guess people would say ... that we have done that , but that is not our intent . "
I told the Elders that it does n't matter what their book sayeth about what I can or can't doeth with my bowel seed .
There 's the Bible , the Koran , the Torah , the Flying Spaghetti Monster Cookbook , and they all maintain different recipes for salvation — but those books do n't establish laws for shrimp eaters , ham lovers , or pastophobes .
Any holy book or religion , if enacted into law , would deny the followers of another book their freedoms .
I asked the two young missionaries , " Would n't it be bigoted if I interpreted my book of faith to take away your rights ? "
Awkward pause .
" As it happens , I do have a book that guides my faith and would repeal your rights if passed into law , " I said .
I 'd folded a few pages of printer paper in half , and on the cover I 'd scrawled " The Book of More Men . "
" The first page here says , ' Mormons shall not foist their doctrine unto others lest those who hateth Mormons subject their rules upon others .
Rule number one : Mormon missionaries must not proselytize . ' "
The guys laughed .
They would return home to Arizona in a few months welted by the tongue - lashings of dozens more fags like me .
We shook hands , and they left .
I put my copy of the Book of Mormon next to the toilet , where all my houseguests could use its pages to wipe their bowel seed .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
Iran 's president said Tuesday his country welcomes talks with the United States " in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect . "
Women in Tehran celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Islamic revolution Tuesday .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made the remarks a day after President Barack Obama said the United States is looking for opportunities for " face to face " dialogue with Iran , even though he has " deep concerns " about Tehran 's actions .
" Right now , the world is entering the era of dialogue , " Ahmadinejad told hundreds of thousands of people in a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Islamic revolution .
" The new U.S. administration announced that it 's willing to bring about a number of changes and is now taking the course for dialogue .
It 's quite clear that real change should be fundamental , not just a tactical change , and it is quite clear that the Iranian nation will greet real changes .
" The Iranian nation is ready to hold up talks , but talks in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect , " Ahmadinejad said .
In Washington , Obama was asked about U.S. relations with Iran during his first prime - time news conference on Monday night .
Watch news conference in full »
" There 's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years , so it 's not going to happen overnight , " Obama said .
He said his administration is reviewing existing U.S. policy toward Iran , which supports groups Washington has branded terrorist organizations , such as Hezbollah and Hamas , and has defied U.N. demands to halt its uranium enrichment program .
Despite those concerns , Obama said his administration wants to use " all the resources at the United States ' disposal " to resolve those concerns .
" My expectation is , in the coming months , we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table , face - to - face diplomatic overtures , that will allow us to move our policy in a new direction , " Obama said .
" So there are going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations , but I think that there 's the possibility at least of a relationship of mutual respect and progress . "
The United States and Iran have not had diplomatic relations since 1979 .
During that year , the Shah of Iran was forced to flee the country and the Ayatollah Khomeini took power .
Later that year , Iranian students took over and seized hostages at the U.S. Embassy .
Relations have been cut since then .
U.S. President George W. Bush labeled Iran as a member of the " axis of evil " after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks .
Iran celebrated the 30th anniversary of the revolution Tuesday with crowds chanting " Death to America . "
Watch the parade in Iran »
Tensions have rippled over issues such as Iran 's nuclear program , Israel , and Iraq , and have been aggravated since the outspoken Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005 .
Western nations believe Iran is intent on building a nuclear weapon .
Ahmadinejad has been criticized for his vehemence against and provocative remarks toward Israel and for Iran 's support of Hamas militants in Gaza and the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon -- militants groups that Israel has battled .
Also , the United States has accused Iran of backing Iraqi insurgents .
In recent years , the Iraq conflict has provided an opportunity for Iran and the United States to cooperate since both countries support the Shiite - dominated Iraqi government and Iraqis have urged both countries to put aside their differences in helping Iraq .
In 2007 , U.S. and Iraqi envoys met several times in Baghdad .
Ahmadinejad addressed the conflict in Iraq , saying that 1 million people have been killed and others have been displaced because of the " Bush administration war on Iraq . "
" To deal with the root cause of insecurity I think that we should go and find the main culprits , including Bush himself and his administration .
They must be put on trial , " said Ahmadinejad .
" The world does not want to see the dark age of Bush being repeated . "
Addressing the issue of terrorism , Ahmadinejad said Iran has been fighting terror for 30 years and that Iran itself been victimized by terror .
" If you want to fight terrorism in practice come and work with the Iranian nation , " he said .
" If you want to eradicate the root causes of massacres and aggression , let 's sit together and see what has been behind the reasons why we have had wars in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East . "
As usual , he had harsh words for Israel , a state he loathes and a topic that whips up passions among his supporters .
" If you want to eradicate crime , let 's work together with the Iranian nation and other nations of the world and let 's put on trial the Zionist leaders of the Zionist regime , " the Iranian leader said .
As for nuclear power , Iran has said it wants to harness it for energy and Ahmadinejad indicated Iran is against deploying nuclear weaponry .
" If you want to fight proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , then you should join us and help us so that we will show you the right way .
Yes we 're opposed to nuclear weapons of mass destruction .
They 're real threats and they must be destroyed .
Iran has been a victim of the use of chemical weapons of mass destruction but the only way would be justice and the use of appropriate mechanisms , " he said .
" If they really want to have real security , then they should be able to work with us and then we will be able to revisit the structure of the Security Council -- and remember the Security Council itself is the root cause of discrimination -- we should change this structure and then have justice . "
The United States also is concerned about Iran 's technological pursuits .
Iran successfully launched its first satellite into orbit last week , a step hailed by Iran 's president as a " source of pride " for the Islamic republic , according to state - run news outlets .
The launch of the satellite Omid -- which means " Hope " in Farsi -- was timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary celebrations of the Islamic revolution in Iran , according to Iranian media reports .
U.S. Department of Defense officials confirmed the launch , and the State Department expressed " grave concern . "
In August , Iran performed a test of a rocket capable of launching a satellite into orbit .
Iranian officials declared that mission a success , but U.S. officials disputed that .
Senior U.S. officials had expressed concerned about the test of the rocket , saying Iran could use the rocket to deliver warheads .
On Monday , Obama said Iran must " send some signals that it wants to act differently , as well , and recognize that , even as it has some rights as a member of the international community , with those rights come responsibilities . "
" It 's important that , even as we engage in this direct diplomacy , we are very clear about certain deep concerns that we have as a country , that Iran understands that we find the funding of terrorist organizations unacceptable , that we 're clear about the fact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in the region that would be profoundly destabilizing . "
Praising Iran 's people history and traditions as " extraordinary , Obama says the nation 's actions over many years now have been unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both in the region and around the world . "
" Their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas , the bellicose language that they 've used towards Israel , their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclear weapon , that all those things create the possibility of destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests , but I think are contrary to the interests of international peace .

Chris Matthews : “ You ’re up there with Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity …
It ’s quite a team . ”
Rick Santelli ( smiling and nodding ) : “ It is quite a team ! ”
Hardball , MSNBC , Feb 20 , 2009
Last week , CNBC correspondent Rick Santelli rocketed from being a little - known second - string correspondent to a populist hero of the disenfranchised , a 21st - century Samuel Adams , the leader and symbol of the downtrodden American masses suffering under the onslaught of 21st century socialism and big government .
Santelli’s “ rant ” last - week calling for a “ Chicago Tea Party ” to protest President Obama ’s plans to help distressed American homeowners rapidly spread across the blogosphere and shot right up into White House spokesman Robert Gibbs ’ craw , whose smackdown during a press conference was later characterized by Santelli as “ a threat ” from the White House .
A nationwide “ tea party ” grassroots Internet protest movement has sprung up seemingly spontaneously , all inspired by Santelli , with rallies planned today in cities from coast to coast to protest against Obama ’s economic policies .
But was Santelli ’s rant really so spontaneous ?
How did a minor - league TV figure , whose contract with CNBC is due this summer , get so quickly launched into a nationwide rightwing blog sensation ?
Why were there so many sites and organizations online and live within minutes or hours after his rant , leading to a nationwide protest just a week after his rant ?
What has n’t been reported until now is evidence linking Santelli ’s “ tea party ” rant with some very familiar names in the Republican rightwing machine , from PR operatives who specialize in imitation - grassroots PR campaigns ( called “ astroturfing ” ) to bigwig politicians and notorious billionaire funders .
As veteran Russia reporters , both of us spent years watching the Kremlin use fake grassroots movements to influence and control the political landscape .
To us , the uncanny speed and direction the movement took and the players involved in promoting it had a strangely forced quality to it .
If it seemed scripted , that ’s because it was .
What we discovered is that Santelli ’s “ rant ” was not at all spontaneous as his alleged fans claim , but rather it was a carefully - planned trigger for the anti-Obama campaign .
In PR terms , his February 19th call for a “ Chicago Tea Party ” was the launch event of a carefully organized and sophisticated PR campaign , one in which Santelli served as a frontman , using the CNBC airwaves for publicity , for the some of the craziest and sleaziest rightwing oligarch clans this country has ever produced .
Namely , the Koch family , the multibilllionaire owners of the largest private corporation in America , and funders of scores of rightwing thinktanks and advocacy groups , from the Cato Institute and Reason Magazine to FreedomWorks .
The scion of the Koch family , Fred Koch , was a co-founder of the notorious extremist - rightwing John Birch Society .
As you read this , Big Business is pouring tens of millions of dollars into their media machines in order to destroy just about every economic campaign promise Obama has made , as reported recently in the Wall Street Journal .
At stake is n’t the little guy ’s fight against big government , as Santelli and his bot - supporters claim , but rather the “ upper 2 percent ” ’s war to protect their wealth from the Obama Adminstration ’s economic plans .
When this Santelli “ grassroots ” campaign is peeled open , what ’s revealed is a glimpse of what is ahead and what is bound to be a hallmark of his presidency .
Let ’s go back to February 19th : Rick Santelli , live on CNBC , standing in the middle of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , launches into an attack on the just - announced $ 300 billion slated to stem rate of home foreclosures :
“ The government is promoting bad behavior !
Do we really want to subsidize the losers ’ mortgages ?!
This is America !
We ’re thinking of having a Chicago tea party in July , all you capitalists who want to come down to Lake Michigan , I ’m gonna start organizing . ”
Almost immediately , the clip and the unlikely “ Chicago tea party ” quote buried in the middle of the segment , zoomed across a well - worn path to headline fame in the Republican echo chamber , including red-alert headlines on Drudge .
Within hours of Santelli ’s rant , a website called ChicagoTeaParty.com sprang to life .
Essentially inactive until that day , it now featured a YouTube video of Santelli ’s “ tea party ” rant and billed itself as the official home of the Chicago Tea Party .
The domain was registered in August , 2008 by Zack Christenson , a dweeby Twitter Republican and producer for a popular Chicago rightwing radio host Milt Rosenberg — a familiar name to Obama campaign people .
Last August , Rosenberg , who looks like Martin Short ’s Irving Cohen character , caused an outcry when he interviewed Stanley Kurtz , the conservative writer who first “ exposed ” a personal link between Obama and former Weather Undergound leader Bill Ayers .
As a result of Rosenberg ’s radio interview , the Ayers story was given a major push through the Republican media echo chamber , culminating in Sarah Palin ’s accusation that Obama was “ palling around with terrorists . ”
That Rosenberg ’s producer owns the “ chicagoteaparty.com ” site is already weird — but what ’s even stranger is that he first bought the domain last August , right around the time of Rosenburg ’s launch of the “ Obama is a terrorist ” campaign .
It ’s as if they held this “ Chicago tea party ” campaign in reserve , like a sleeper - site .
Which is exactly what it was .
ChicagoTeaParty.com was just one part of a larger network of Republican sleeper - cell - blogs set up over the course of the past few months , all of them tied to a shady rightwing advocacy group coincidentally named the “ Sam Adams Alliance , ” whose backers have until now been kept hidden from public .
Cached google records that we discovered show that the Sam Adams Alliance took pains to scrub its deep links to the Koch family money as well as the fake - grassroots “ tea party ” protests going on today .
All of these roads ultimately lead back to a more notorious rightwing advocacy group , FreedomWorks , a powerful PR organization headed by former Republican House Majority leader Dick Armey and funded by Koch money .
On the same day as Santelli ’s rant , February 19 , another site called Officialchicagoteaparty.com went live .
This site was registered to Eric Odom , who turned out to be a veteran Republican new media operative specializing in imitation - grassroots PR campaigns .
Last summer , Odom organized a twitter - led campaign centered around DontGo.com to pressure Congress and Nancy Pelosi to pass the offshore oil drilling bill , something that would greatly benefit Koch Industries , a major player in oil and gas .
Now , six months later , Odom ’s DontGo movement was resurrected to play a central role in promoting the “ tea party ” movement .
Up until last month , Odom was officially listed as the “ new media coordinator ” for the Sam Adams Alliance , a well - funded libertarian activist organization based in Chicago that was set up only recently .
Samuel Adams the historical figure was famous for inspiring and leading the Boston Tea Party — so when the PR people from the Chicago - based Sam Adams Alliance abruptly leave in order to run Santelli ’s “ Chicago Tea Party , ” you know it was n’t spontaneous .
Odom certainly does n’t want people to know about the link : his name was scrubbed from the Sam Adams Alliance website recently , strongly suggesting that they wanted to cover their tracks .
Thanks to google caching , you can see the SAA ’s before - after scrubbing .
Separated at Head Pubes ?
Rising Koch revolutionary Eric Odom… and embalmed Marxist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin ?
Even the Sam Adams ’ January 31 announcement that Odom ’s fake - grassroots group was “ no longer sponsored by the Alliance ” was shortly afterwards scrubbed .
But it ’s the Alliance ’s scrubbing of their link to Koch that is most telling .
A cached page , erased on February 16 , just three days before Santelli ’s rant , shows that the Alliance also wanted to cover up its ties to the Koch family .
The missing link was an announcement that students interested in applying for internships to the Sam Adams Alliance could also apply through the “ Charles G. Koch Summer Fellow Program ” through the Institute for Humane Studies , a Koch - funded rightwing institute designed to scout and nurture future leaders of corporate libertarian ideology .
( See hi-resolution screenshots here . )
The top two board directors at the Sam Adams Alliance include two figures with deep ties to Koch - funded programs : Eric O’Keefe , who previously served in Koch ’s Institute for Humane Studies and the Club For Growth ; and Joseph Lehman , a former communications VP at Koch ’s Cato Institute .
All of these are ultimately linked up to Koch ’s Freedom Works mega - beast .
Freedomworks.org has drawn fire in the past for using fake grassroots internet campaigns , called “ astroturfing , ” to push for pet Koch projects such as privatizing social security .
A New York Times investigation in 2005 revealed that a “ regular single mom ” paraded by Bush ’s White House to advocate for privatizing social security was in fact FreedomWorks ’
Iowa state director .
The woman , Sandra Jacques , also fronted another Iowa fake - grassroots group called “ For Our Grandchildren , ” even though privatizing social security was really “ For Koch And Wall Street Fat Cats . ”
If you log into FreedomWorks.org today , its home page features a large photo of Rick Santelli pointing at the viewer like Uncle Sam , with the words : “ Are you with Rick ?
We Are . Click here to learn more . ”
FreedomWorks , along with scores of shady front organizations which do n’t have to disclose their sponsors thanks to their 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status , has been at the heart of today ’s supposed grassroots , nonpartisan “ tea party ” protests across the country , supposedly fueled by scores of websites which masquerade as amateur / spontaneous projects , but are suspiciously well - crafted and surprisingly well - written .
One slick site pushing the tea parties , Right.org claims , “ Right.org is a grassroots online community created by a few friends who were outraged by the bailouts .
So we gathered some talent and money and built this site .
Please tell your friends , and if you have suggestions for improving it , please let us know .
Respectfully , Evan and Duncan . ”
But funny enough , these regular guys are offering a $ 27,000 prize for an “ anti- bailout video competition . ”
Who are Evan and Duncan ?
Do they even really exist ?
Even Facebook pages dedicated to a specific city “ tea party ” events , supposedly written by people connected only by a common emotion , obviously conformed to the same style .
It was as if they were part of a multi- pronged advertising campaign planned out by a professional PR company .
Yet , on the surface , they pretended to have no connection .
The various sites set up their own Twitter feeds and Facebook pages dedicated to the Chicago Tea Party movement .
And all of them linked to one another , using it as evidence that a decentralized , viral movement was already afoot .
It was n’t about partisanship ; it was about real emotions coming straight from real people .
While it ’s clear what is at stake for the Koch oligarch clan and their corporate and political allies — fighting to keep the hundreds of billions in surplus profits they ’ve earned thanks to pro-rich economic policies over the past 30 years — what ’s a little less obvious is Santelli ’s link to all this .
Why would he ( and CNBC ) risk their credibility , such as it is , as journalists dispensing financial information in order to act as PR fronts for a partisan campaign ?
As noted above , Santelli ’s contract with CNBC runs out in a few months .
His 10 years with the network have n’t been remarkable , and he ’ll enter a brutal downsizing media job market .
Thanks to the “ tea party ” campaign , as the article notes , Santelli ’s value has suddenly soared .
If you look at the scores of blogs and fake - commenters on blogs ( for example , Daily Blog , a slick new blog launched in January which is also based in Chicago ) all puff up Santelli like he ’s the greatest journalist in America , and the greatest hero known to mankind .
Daily Bail , like so much of this “ tea party ” machine , is “ headquartered nearby ” to Santelli , that is , in Chicago .
With Odom , the Sam Adams Alliance , and the whole “ tea party ” nexus : “ Rick , this message is to you .
You are a true American hero and there are no words to describe what you did today except your own .
Headquartered nearby , we will be helping the organization in whatever way possible . ”
It ’s not difficult to imagine how Santelli hooked up with this crowd .
A self - described “ Ayn Rand - er , ” one of Santelli ’s colleagues at CNBC , Lawrence Kudlow , played a major role in both FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth .
So today ’s protests show that the corporate war is on , and this is how they ’ll fight it : hiding behind “ objective ” journalists and “ grassroots ” new media movements .
Because in these times , if you want to push for policies that help the super - wealthy , you better do everything you can to make it seem like it ’s “ the people ” who are “ spontaneously ” fighting your fight .
As a 19th century slave management manual wrote , “ The master should make it his business to show his slaves , that the advancement of his individual interest , is at the same time an advancement of theirs .
Once they feel this , it will require little compulsion to make them act as becomes them . ” ( Southern Agriculturalist IX , 1836 . )
The question now is , will they get away with it , and will the rest of America advance the interests of Koch , Santelli , and the rest of the masters ?

In a classless move , President Bush snubbed Helen Thomas , the longtime Press Pool reporter covering the White House , and refused to take a question from her as she sat in the front row , waving her hand to him as he asked his final question from his last presser .
She 's covered more presidents than Bush has verbs in his vocabulary .
The snub ran directly counter to the sentiments expressed in his opening remarks regarding the press :
Through it all , it 's been -- I have respected you .
Sometimes did n't like the stories that you wrote or reported on .
Sometimes you misunderestimated me .
But always the relationship I have felt has been professional .
And I appreciate it .
I appreciate -- I do appreciate working with you .
My friends say , what is it like to deal with the press corps ?
I said , these are just people trying to do the best they possibly can .
I guess he did n't appreciate working with her since she called him out for many of his policies .
Maybe he just misunderestimated her too ...
Living teeth are better for gums than false ones
Scientists at King 's College London have been awarded £ 500,000 to help them develop human teeth from stem cells .
The company Odontis , set up by the college , hopes to develop its research for tests on humans within two years after successful research on mice .
Stem cells , the so - called master cells , would be programmed to develop into teeth and then transplanted into the patient 's jaw where the gap is .
It is thought it would then take two months for the tooth to fully develop .
Healthy gums
But it could be five years before the technology is widely available to the general public .
On average Britons aged over 50 lose around 12 teeth out of 32 .
Professor Paul Sharpe is the genetic research scientist behind the technique and head of division of Craniofacial Biology and Biomaterials at the Dental Institute at King 's College .
He said : " A key advantage of our technology is that a living tooth can preserve the health of the surrounding tissues much better than artificial prosthesis .
" Teeth are living , and they are able to respond to a person 's bite .
" They move and in doing so they maintain the health of the surrounding gums and teeth . "
The cost should not be more than the price of synthetic implants of between £ 1,500 - £ 2,000 .
His project has been awarded £ 300,000 from the Wellcome Trust , £ 100,000 from the National Endowment for Science , Technology and the Arts ( Nesta ) and £ 100,000 from a business sponsor .
A spokesman for the British Dental Association ( BDA ) said : " The BDA welcomes projects like Odontis and looks forward to seeing further progress in this field . "

This is a very strange scene , and I feel I cannot accurately comment on it except to note that it is strange .
simon666 - 2008-09-04
- 2008-09-04 i once was very into radical leftist ideals / dogmas etc when i was young and confronted with the " wrongs " of the world .
i have a hard time know listening to much of the short - sighted piffle of these folks now , but the idea of un-arrest is something i still very much like .
yes it is very strange .
particularly when you notice at the end of the clip , how the cop does n't feel threatened at all and walks off .
a single cop in a huge crowd not feeling threatened ....
Helena Handbasket - 2008-09-04
- 2008-09 -04 Yeah .
I 'm not sure about this either .
I would like to more about the incident and whehtehr thsi guy was actually an " anarchist " or what .
But , that was a pretty awesome tackle .
IrishWhiskey - 2008-09-05
- 2008-09-05 I just got released from jail a few hours ago after being swept up in a mass sweep while walking through St Paul .
Ironically , even though I had been protesting earlier in the day , at the time I was hit by pepper spray and arrested I was with a group of ordinary people waiting for a bus , not involved in anything .
The police cordoned off a large section of the capitol and swept everyone inside toward the bridge , including people emerging from shopping at Sears .
Innocent people outside the perimeter who asked what the safe way to leave was , were ordered by police toward the ( one - sided ) violence and into danger , where they were promptly gassed , tazered , and arrested .
This included young kids , old ladies and members of the media .
The police officers processing were generally friendly , polite , and clearly did n't want to be there .
However some of the riot cops were outright assholes , laughing at a high - school girl suffering an asthma attack , and flipping off detainees .
I clearly saw one ride up to two innocent bystanders in a public area , spray them in the face , and ride away .
Again , that was only a few of the riot cops , but the entire response was wildly disproportionate to the peaceful protest going on .

Whenever I watch these videos of cops indiscriminately spraying crowds , I can't help but thinking that the crowd reacts exactly how my cat would react if I were to spray her with some water .
That begs the question : is mace to people what water is to cats , or am I a fascist who prevents my noble feline from dicking around on my countertops ?
quantumcreep - 2008-09-22
- 2008-09 - 22
To be fair , none of us know the actual details of the story , so we should all stop bitching about his use of mace .
From what we all saw , he was attempting to arrest an uncooperative person while being followed by a mob of people , who eventually attacked him .
If you were in his shoes , would you not have reacted ?
Would n't you have thought that the whole mob was attacking you after being literally TACKLED by a couple ?
Seriously , everyone needs to shut the fuck up about this being an example of police brutality .
If they did n't want to get maced they should not have been surrounding him and threatening him with violence .
quantumcreep - 2008-09 - 22
For the record , I have been to a few protests in my time , including the FTAA meeting in Miami a few years back .
I know what excessive force looks like .

StanleyPain - 2008-09-05
I do n't advocate violence against cops , despite how fucked up this whole RNC thing is going , but this video only further proves my point as to why people need to stop with the apologetics for this kind of authoritarian behavior .
When you pull that shit , ALL COPS lose respect and for all we know this cop might maybe have actually been trying to do his job , but instead he was assaulted because how the fuck are we supposed to know which cops are doing their jobs and which ones are just tiny - dicked steroid cases with big egos ?
j lzrd / swift idiot - 2008-09-05
How the fuck are we supposed to know which cops are just tiny - dicked steroid cases with big egos ?
Indeed .
Ever hear that joke about how to tell if a lawyer is lying ?
UnderANeonHalo - 2008-09-05
" indiscriminately spraying the crowd . "
I so fucking agree with you guys , I mean that cop did n't even ask that angry crowd cheering after he 's suckered punched and laying on the ground just who was going to close in and lynch him !
When you go to a political protest ( left or right mind you ) you had better expect the asshole next to you to throw a brick at the line of cops , and when he does you better be ready for 200 pissed off riot cops to bring their batons against your fucking head .
These folks were lucky one cop was only shoulder checked .
5 for the cop getting knocked down and another 5 for hippies getting pepper sprayed .

I give you Mr. Black hoody as an anarchist , but come on !
What about girl in the blue ?
She has the stereotypical pot head hippy slouch .
And the dirty guy with the guitar crying ?
Man if he ain't a hippy I 'll eat my hemp pucca shell choker !

This dude was probably a vegan , which would explain why his flying body tackle barely budged the cop .
I hate dickhead cops ( and this one did n't seem like too much of a dickhead , ) but I 'm fairly certain that I hate these fuckfaces more .

Not a smoking gun by any means , but I support all of this filming of the cops in general .
Eventually someone 's going to record the next " Rodney King " and something will come of it .

I do n't know how to rate this one .
Who the hell knows what led to the arrest ?
I tend to side with the protesters , especially after my own experiences protesting the war in NY and DC , but we do n't really know what that guy did to get himself hauled off .
I 've done a bit of crowd control in Iraq , and I can tell you that the cop is a brave motherfucker and I do n't blame him for using the mace to keep people from crowding in on him .
You get in my face and act tough , I better knock you down , otherwise I 'm trusting you not to hurt me .
Mobs are scary , and all it takes is one loony blindsiding you and knocking you off your feet , and then you 're on the pavement with 10 previously - chickenshit rioters stomping your skull .
And yes , I protested the war and then served in it .
America 's like that .

( CNN ) -- Love 's first blush fading ?
Lost that loving feeling ?
Love is not all around ?
Scientists have used brain scans to study how long love lasts between couples .
Sick of cliches ?
Take heart , scientists have discovered that people can have a love that lasts a lifetime .
Using brain scans , researchers at Stony Brook University in New York have discovered a small number of couples respond with as much passion after 20 years together as most people only do during the early throes of romance , Britain 's Sunday Times newspaper reported .
The researchers scanned the brains of couples together for 20 years and compared them with results from new lovers , the Sunday Times said .
About 10 percent of the mature couples had the same chemical reactions when shown photographs of their loved ones as those just starting out .
Previous research has suggested that the first stages of romantic love fade within 15 months and after 10 years it has gone completely , the newspaper said .
" The findings go against the traditional view of romance -- that it drops off sharply in the first decade -- but we are sure it 's real , " said Arthur Aron , a psychologist at Stony Brook , told the Sunday Times .
Defense attorney William DuBois and Hans Reiser confer during Reiser 's murder trial .
* Sketch : Norman Quebedeau .
*Hans Reiser wants a trial do - over .
Reiser is the Linux guru who in April was convicted of the first - degree murder of his estranged wife .
He 's the same defendant who , in exchange for a 15 - to - life term instead of a 25 - to - life term , brought authorities to the Oakland hills where he buried Nina Reiser 's body .
He even apologized for killing her .
But in a handwritten appellate motion , he is appealing his conviction .
Yet there 's a glaring problem with this appeal , in which he claims he thought the deal would have only sent him away for three years , not 15 - to - life .
When he took the 15 - to - life deal in August , he waived his right to appeal .
And when entering the deal , he said he understood what he was doing and was represented by effective counsel .
The appeal was first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle .
Perhaps Reiser is a little peeved that he turned down a pretrial deal last year with Alameda County Superior Court Judge Larry Goodman , in which the developer of the ReiserFS file system was offered three years if he pleaded guilty and disclosed where he hid 31 - year - old Nina Reiser 's body .
But the boyhood genius thought he could outsmart the jury , which grew tired of his hours on the witness stand attempting to explain away a myriad of coincidences linking him to his wife 's murder - – days of testimony his attorney said was against his advice .
Now the 44 - year - old Reiser says he thinks the latest deal was supposed to have netted three years .
And he said his lead attorney , William DuBois , who he often butted heads with during trial , was out to get him .
Reiser wrote ( .pdf ) that he believed DuBois suffered from an excess of oxytocin .
" Persons with oxytocin excess enjoy betraying others , " Reiser wrote .
Reiser added , " I believe that the attraction of duping and betraying me exceeded the attraction of duping and betraying a jury , due to my unique personal characteristics . "
Reiser demands that DuBois ' oxytocin levels be tested , and that if they are high , the courts should determine that Reiser was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and be granted a new trial .
DuBois was not immediately available for comment .
Trial judge Larry Goodman denied ( .pdf ) Reiser 's handwritten motion , which was n't even made to a California appellate court .
Reiser called his lawyer delusional and claimed he picked jurors based on Chinese astrology .
" It is a logical necessity that either I am delusional , or he is delusional . "
Threat Level covered the trial gavel to gavel for six months and knows the answer to that question .
The convict is also demanding a polygraph test " to prove my counsel colluded with agents of the State of California to perpetuate numerous other frauds relating to the case . "
Here 's a short synopsis of Reiser 's courtroom defense , the so - called " geek defense . "
* He told jurors his 31 - year - old wife , whom he met in Russia , fled the United States and abandoned the divorcing couple 's two young children after he accused her of bilking his Namesys software company .
Her blood was found in her house , where she was last seen , because she either cut her finger cooking or had a bloody nose , he testified .
* The passenger seat of his car went missing because he threw it away .
That tiny Honda CRX was filled with water when the authorities discovered it weeks after Nina went missing Sept. 3 , 2006 because it was dirty and needing a good washing .
He was a computer geek , a " scientist , " he told jurors , and his guilt - ridden behavior in the aftermath of his wife 's disappearance was a result of staring at a computer for too long .
Jurors , and even the judge , did a horrible job concealing their amusement when Reiser was on the stand .
They often shook their heads in disbelief or openly mocked his ongoing testimony .

Quote : i think activision deserves most of the blame .
activision always seems to give treyarch the shaft as a filler in between Infinitywards cod titles .
activision seems to try to just get another cod title out using treyarch as cheaply as possible keeping treyarch as a mistreated stepchild .
So much so , that now , they 'll be embarrassed to put Treyarch on their resumes in the future .
As for Treyarch being used as fodder for IW , if such was / is the case , then the people at Treyarch should all walk before they have no reputation left at all .
Quote : and when talking about JD and his poor communication along with the rest of the treyarchs lack of communication .
what are they supposed to say ?
i bet they were upset having to release the game in the state it was and being forced to drop things they were working on for the game along with having the proper bug testing and fixing .
but treyarch cant come out and say that about activision , that would make activision look bad .
so for treyarchs lack of communication i dont know what they are really supposed to say thats probably why they have been so quiet until recently .
THE TRUTH !
Misleading statements from both Activision / Treyarch will not be easily forgotten or overlooked .
As it stands now , anything coming from Treyarch and / or JD is taken with a grain of salt because people are tired of being fed a line of bullshit .
Also , the Nuremberg Defense does not and will not fit in this situation .
Both Treyarch and JD will be held responsible for what they have done .
Consumer Abuse is a serious offense these days .
Quote : we had patches every few of weeks with the release of cod4 probably just like tally says because IW had alot more funding from activision for patching .
treyarch might be able to do 1 more patch after 1.2 .
so they really have to get it right .
but no doubt we pc users got the shaft .
Forget the dollars involved , we are talking about a multi-billion dollar corporation .
The money would be no problem if they cared to support the product properly .
They could very easily have forwarded at least two smaller patches already .
They just have a shitbird policy in place that is going to bury both them and the game .
Now that the situation is confrontational , they 'll go stubborn and screw themselves and the game 's potential by purposely not releasing on or before January 31 , 2009 .
Quote : so anyways i personally am very frustrated with the whole state of the game and how it was released .
but i would say the majority of the blame belongs to activision and not treyarch .
a COD W@W blackout is the right and practical thing to do to force this issue but i hope people remember activision is probably alot more to blame than treyarch IMHO .
Quote : let the black out begin ....
They BOTH share the blame for this fiasco equally for both the serious problems in WaW and lousy Consumer Support policies .
Correct , Treyarch appears to have been forced to release a substandard game by Activision 's Marketing Group .
Not so sure about that ....
I believe that the people at Treyarch who went along with this travesty solely for the money lost all self respect and realization of the true principles of their profession .
So much so , that now , they 'll be embarrassed to put Treyarch on their resumes in the future .
As for Treyarch being used as fodder for IW , if such was / is the case , then the people at Treyarch should all walk before they have no reputation left at all .
What were / are they supposed to say ??
Simple :!
Misleading statements from both Activision / Treyarch will not be easily forgotten or overlooked .
As it stands now , anything coming from Treyarch and / or JD is taken with a grain of salt because people are tired of being fed a line of bullshit .
Also , the Nuremberg Defense does not and will not fit in this situation .
Both Treyarch and JD will be held responsible for what they have done .
Consumer Abuse is a serious offense these days .
Actually you are 100 % correct , we did have patches every few weeks from IW .
As a result , that FACT alone tears to shreds the Bullshit 8 - 10 weeks for a single patch that JD tried to push on us .
Do n't forget the swift release of Patch 1.1 the now infamous Day * 0 * patch .
That patch " miraculously appeared " in no time at all .
The 8 - 10 week JD scenario is pure Bullshit .
They proved that themselves by their own performance .
Forget the dollars involved , we are talking about a multi-billion dollar corporation .
The money would be no problem if they cared to support the product properly .
They could very easily have forwarded at least two smaller patches already .
They just have a shitbird policy in place that is going to bury both them and the game .
Now that the situation is confrontational , they 'll go stubborn and screw themselves and the game 's potential by purposely not releasing on or before January 31 , 2009 .
Both Activision and Treyarch share the blame equally .
It shall if they miss the January 31 , 2009 deadline .

MONTREAL–Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe says his party 's agreement with the Liberal - New Democrat coalition is just as robust as it was before the Governor General prorogued Parliament last month .
Duceppe said yesterday he does n't expect Prime Minister Stephen Harper to change his tone and meet the opposition 's demands in Tuesday 's federal budget .
" I 'd be very surprised if he 's coming with changes that are meeting the targets we proposed , so nothing 's changed yet , " Duceppe said before sitting down for a Bloc caucus meeting in Montreal .
He said the Liberal - NDP coalition , formed with the Bloc 's support last month , has presented the best strategies to guide the country through the economic crisis .
" And most of those proposals came from the Bloc , " Duceppe said .
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff has remained lukewarm about the idea of forming a coalition , which was initiated by his predecessor , Stéphane Dion .
Ignatieff has said the Liberals would support a " modest " temporary deficit to stimulate the economy , but has refused to specify exactly what " modest " means .
Harper , who met with Ignatieff on Monday , appeared to include the Liberals in his definition of an emerging compromise on the budget , which is needed to keep his minority government alive .
Duceppe , however , said he does n't believe murmurs in the media that suggest Ignatieff has cozied up to Harper .
" Mr. Harper spoke about an emerging consensus – I do n't know where he heard that , " he said .
" I have n't seen it . "
The coalition agreement is still intact but the opposition parties wo n't take their positions until the government presents its budget , the sovereignist leader said .

Saturday , 17 Jan , 2009 Current Events
The number one software developer in the world , Microsoft , has once again been accused by the European Commission , which states that the company violated the rules of competition by tying its Internet Explorer web browser to the popular Windows operating system , developed by the same Microsoft .
According to the commission , it achieved a preliminary view that the American software company had violated the rules of the EU and undercut consumer choice .
It is worth mentioning that for many years the European Union together with Microsoft were involved in legal battles .
For instance , in 2008 the software giant was fined by the European Union by 899 million euros , which is about $ 1.4 billion for anticompetitive behavior , reports BBC News .
On January 16 , the Commission issued a statement in which it said : " Microsoft 's tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system harms competition between web browsers , undermines product innovation and ultimately reduces consumer choice . "
The EU has given the software company 8 weeks to reply .
Currently Microsoft controls the biggest share of the web - browsing market with its Internet Explorer web browser .
According to the analysts , Microsoft has greatly diversified and it is no longer dependent on its Windows operating system .
The revenue mainly comes to the company from sales of its Xbox and server software .
What determines how much coverage a climate study gets ?
It probably goes without saying that it is n’t strongly related to the quality of the actual science , nor to the clarity of the writing .
Appearing in one of the top journals does help ( Nature , Science , PNAS and occasionally GRL ) , though that in itself is no guarantee .
Instead , it most often depends on the ‘ news ’ value of the bottom line .
Journalists and editors like stories that surprise , that give something ‘ new ’ to the subject and are therefore likely to be interesting enough to readers to make them read past the headline .
It particularly helps if a new study runs counter to some generally perceived notion ( whether that is rooted in fact or not ) .
In such cases , the ‘ news peg ’ is clear .
And so it was for the Steig et al “ Antarctic warming ” study that appeared last week .
Mainstream media coverage was widespread and generally did a good job of covering the essentials .
The most prevalent peg was the fact that the study appeared to reverse the “ Antarctic cooling ” meme that has been a staple of disinformation efforts for a while now .
It ’s worth remembering where that idea actually came from .
Back in 2001 , Peter Doran and colleagues wrote a paper about the Dry Valleys long term ecosystem responses to climate change , in which they had a section discussing temperature trends over the previous couple of decades ( not the 50 years time scale being discussed this week ) .
The “ Antarctic cooling ” was in their title and ( unsurprisingly ) dominated the media coverage of their paper as a counterpoint to “ global warming ” .
( By the way , this is a great example to indicate that the biggest bias in the media is towards news , not any particular side of a story ) .
Subsequent work indicated that the polar ozone hole ( starting in the early 80s ) was having an effect on polar winds and temperature patterns ( Thompson and Solomon , 2002 ; Shindell and Schmidt , 2004 ) , showing clearly that regional climate changes can sometimes be decoupled from the global picture .
However , even then both the extent of any cooling and the longer term picture were more difficult to discern due to the sparse nature of the observations in the continental interior .
In fact we discussed this way back in one of the first posts on RealClimate back in 2004 .
This ambiguity was of course a gift to the propagandists .
Thus for years the Doran et al study was trotted out whenever global warming was being questioned .
It was of course a classic ‘ cherry pick ’ – find a region or time period when there is a cooling trend and imply that this contradicts warming trends on global scales over longer time periods .
Given a complex dynamic system , such periods and regions will always be found , and so as a tactic it can always be relied on .
However , judging from the take - no - prisoners response to the Steig et al paper from the contrarians , this important fact seems to have been forgotten ( hey guys , do n’t worry you ’ll come up with something new soon ! ) .
Actually , some of the pushback has been hilarious .
It ’s been a great example for showing how incoherent and opportunistic the ‘ antis ’ really are .
Exhibit A is an email ( and blog post ) sent out by Senator Inhofe ’s press staff ( i.e. Marc Morano ) .
Within this single email there are misrepresentations , untruths , unashamedly contradictory claims and a couple of absolutely classic quotes .
Some highlights :
Dr. John Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville slams new Antarctic study for using [ the ] “ best estimate of the continent ’s temperature ”
Perhaps he ’d prefer it if they used the worst estimate ? ;)
[ Update :
It should go without saying that this is simply Morano making up stuff and does n’t reflect Christy ’s actual quotes or thinking .
No -one is safe from Morano ’s misrepresentations ! ]
[ Further update : They ’ve now clarified it .
Sigh … . ]
Morano has his ear to the ground of course , and in his blog piece dramatically highlights the words “ estimated ” and “ deduced ” as if that was some sign of nefarious purpose , rather than a fundamental component of scientific investigation .
Internal contradictions are par for the course .
Morano has previously been convinced that “… the vast majority of Antarctica has cooled over the past 50 years . ” , yet he now approvingly quotes Kevin Trenberth who says “ It is hard to make data where none exist . ”
( It is indeed , which is why you need to combine as much data as you can find in order to produce a synthesis like this study ) .
So which is it ?
If you think the data are clear enough to demonstrate strong cooling , you ca n’t also believe there is no data ( on this side of the looking glass anyway ) .
It ’s even more humourous , since even the more limited analysis available before this paper showed pretty much the same amount of Antarctic warming .
Compare the IPCC report , with the same values from the new analysis ( under various assumptions about the methodology ) .
( The different versions are the full reconstruction , a version that uses detrended satellite data for the co-variance , a version that uses AWS data instead of satelltes and one that use PCA instead of RegEM .
All show positive trends over the last 50 years ) .
Further contradictions abound : Morano , who clearly wants it to have been cooling , hedges his bets with a “ Volcano , Not Global Warming Effects , May be Melting an Antarctic Glacier ” Hail Mary pass .
Good luck with that !
It always helps if you have n’t actually read the study in question .
That way you can just make up conclusions :
Scientist adjusts data — presto , Antarctic cooling disappears
Nope .
It ’s still there ( as anyone reading the paper will see ) – it ’s just put into a larger scale and longer term context ( see figure 3 b ) .
Inappropriate personalisation is always good fodder .
Many contrarians seemed disappointed that Mike was only the fourth author ( the study would have been much easier to demonise if he ’d been the lead ) .
Some pretended he was anyway , and just for good measure accused him of being a ‘ modeller ’ as well ( heaven forbid ! ) .
Others also got in on the fun .
A chap called Ross Hays posted a letter to Eric on multiple websites and on many comment threads .
On Joe D’Aleo ’s site , this letter was accompanied with this little bit of snark :
Icecap Note : Ross shown here with Antarctica ’s Mount Erebus volcano in the background was a CNN forecast Meteorologist ( a student of mine when I was a professor ) who has spent numerous years with boots on the ground working for NASA in Antarctica , not sitting at a computer in an ivory tower in Pennsylvania or Washington State
This is meant as a slur against academics of course , but is particularly ironic , since the authors of the paper have collectively spent over 8 seasons on the ice in Antarctica , 6 seasons in Greenland and one on Baffin Island in support of multiple ice coring and climate measurement projects .
Hays ’ one or two summers there , his personal anecdotes and misreadings of the temperature record , do n’t really cut it .
Neither do rather lame attempts to link these results with the evils of “ computer modelling ” .
According to Booker ( for it is he ! ) because a data analysis uses a computer , it must be a computer model – and probably the same one that the “ hockey stick ” was based on .
Bad computer , bad !
The proprietor of the recently named “ Best Science Blog ” , also had a couple of choice comments :
In my opinion , this press release and subsequent media interviews were done for media attention .
This remarkable conclusion is followed by some conspiratorial gossip implying that a paper that was submitted over a year ago was deliberately timed to coincide with a speech in Congress from Al Gore that was announced last week .
Gosh these scientists are good .
All in all , the critical commentary about this paper has been remarkably weak .
Time will tell of course – confirming studies from ice cores and independent analyses are already published , with more rumoured to be on their way .
In the meantime , floating ice shelves in the region continue to collapse ( the Wilkins will be the tenth in the last decade or so ) – each of them with their own unique volcano no doubt – and gravity measurements continue to show net ice loss over the Western part of the ice sheet .
Nonetheless , the loss of the Antarctic cooling meme is clearly bothering the contrarians much more than the loss of 10,000 year old ice .
The poor level of their response is not surprising , but it does exemplify the tactics of the whole ‘ bury ones head in the sand ” movement – they ’d much rather make noise than actually work out what is happening .
It would be nice if this demonstration of intellectual bankruptcy got some media attention itself .
That ’s unlikely though .
It ’s just not news .
Some films have moments of utter brilliance , or even just good solid quality , that are tainted by a far weaker back - end .
Here , we highlight the films that are worth stopping while they ’re at their peak …
AI
Stanley Kubrick ’s name is going to appear more than once in this lineup , and even though he did n’t direct AI ( with the project being realised by Steven Spielberg after Kubrick ’s death ) , his fingerprints are all over it .
The film ’s opening segment is absolutely outstanding , a stunning , chilling tale that features Haley Joel Osment ’s very best performance .
The second half loses the tone and changes the feel of the film a lot , and not for the better .
Wait til the scene in the woods , and then reach for the off button .
Then watch the first half all over again and revel in one of the most underappreciated segments of modern day big screen science - fiction .
Cat ’s Eye
Here ’s something a bit more obscure .
This 80s trio of stories , based on the writing of Stephen King , has one absolute stand - out , and it ’s the very first story .
This is the one where James Woods attempts to give up smoking , by going through the sinister company known as Quitters Inc .
Really effectively put together , it ’s quite an unsettling short piece , and easily better than what follows .
That said , we do have a soft spot for Drew Barrymore battling a strange creature who lives in the skirting board right at the end .
Brosnan ’s Bond movies
After each modern day Bond reboot , you can see a formula falling into shape when Eon selects its next director .
And so with Roger Spottiswoode on Tomorrow Never Dies , Michael Apted on The World Is Not Enough and Lee Tamahori on Die Another Day , the appointed director of the moment can have the first half of the film , post the credits , to make the film they want .
Then the stunt guys have to come in , and you can almost see the point where the director is no longer really in charge .
There was an element of it in Quantum Of Solace , too .
Last month , we noted that acting poor is all the rage among the rich .
Sort of like reducing your carbon footprint was the big thing last year .
Vanity Fair's Michael Shnayerson brings us more obnoxious examples of the wealthy complaining about how poor they are now .
For instance , the laidoff Lehman executive who is cutting her maid 's rather than sell her handbags or the ghastly idea of flying commercial .
Now many bankers , along with discovering $ 15 bottles of wine , are finding other ways to cut back — if not out of necessity , then from collective guilt and fear : the fitness trainer from three times a week to once a week ; the haircut and highlights every eight weeks instead of every five .
One prominent “ hedgie ” recently flew to China for business — but not on a private plane , as before .
“ Why should I pay $ 250,000 for a private plane , ” he said to a friend , “ when I can pay $ 20,000 to fly commercial first class ? ”
But here 's the thing , the problem facing the economy right now is the lack of demand .
So , if you have money , you should be spending it and enjoying it and keeping your maids employed .
We 'll still think you 're assholes , but we 're gonna think that no matter what .
A Show of Effort
Every woman wants to know that her man has put a little bit of effort into creating a special Valentine 's Day .
They prefer to see that there was some time spent in planning the evening and not about how much money was spent .
In fact , it is even better to spend more time than money on Valentine 's Day .
Plan a special evening that needs some forethought and preparation .
Women feel that you just stopped at the local flower shop to collect some roses on your way home .
Gift her a night devoted to what she wants and desires , do not just throw something together at the last moment .
Proof You Listen to Her and Know What She Likes
One of your most important jobs in the relationship as a man , is to listen to your woman .
Every woman drops hints now and than in casual talk .
For instance , if you are both out shopping , she might see a bunch of tulips , and say " I just love tulips !
Pink tulips are my favorite flowers . "
The best thing you can do is listen to that information , store it , and recall it later on .
So , rather than buying the standard red roses on Valentine 's Day , buy her pink tulips instead .
As she probably already gas forgotten that she told you , she will be impressed that you knew about her favorite pink tulips .
Even if she remembers , she will appreciate that you thought back of this and that you took all the hassle to surprise her with her favorite flowers .
Certainly , this does n't just work for the flowers .
You can implement this for anything , like a certain food she loves , a hotel or hideaway she would like to take with you , a piece of jewelry she adores , or maybe something way - out as she probably desired to learn ballroom dancing .
Sign both of you up for some lessons , and she will appreciate it .
There are so many possibilities to make Valentine 's Day memorable if you just listen to her .
Pamper Her
Every woman loves to be pampered .
A few women may not be used to it , or they probably do n't even know that they like , but I promise you , all women will love it .
No , a gift certificate to the spa is not the one I am talking about and here 's why .
When you pamper a woman you are taking care of her .
You are making her feel good , and by doing the pampering yourself , you are expressing your love .
But in which way can you pamper her ?
Every woman is different and likes some things more than others .
So , listen to her and remember what she likes .
Also you can ask her early enough .
But here are some suggestions to get you going .
You can prepare a bubble bath for two including candles and champagne .
If she does n't like this , you might think of getting a small bottle of massage oil , get her into her bath robe and give her a back massage .
If she is a woman who is most of the day on her days on her feet , consider to give her a pedicure .
Valentine 's Day is just about the corner .
So what do you plan to get her this year ?
Perhaps you are sick of doing the same old " red roses and a box of chocolates " thing and you prefer to create this year a Valentine 's Day she will remember without spending a fortune .
So , here are the top three things every woman desires for Valentine 's Day .
You might be surprised !
Which ever way you pamper her , it should be done just for her enjoyment and it is not just meant to be a way to get her warmed up for sex .
If it leads that way , then all the better .
But remember to pamper her exclusively with the purpose of making her feel good .
Women have a sense for it , if they are being primed for sex or if it is a true act of kindness .
The key to everything is to listen to her and to find out what she really likes and than plan an evening dedicated to her desires .
Surprise her with her preferred things rather than the ordinary red Valentines roses , chocolates , and teddy bears .
If you spend some time and effort to prepare this Valentine 's Day , it will be a night that she will remember and brag to her friends about .
Still not inspired ?
Here are some more gift ideas for Valentine 's Day
White House admits negligence in finding , preserving missing e-mails Nick Cargo
Published : Wednesday January 14 , 2009

In the ongoing quest to find and properly archive missing e-mails , the White House acknowledged that little has been done to make sure that all records will be properly preserved , despite previous rulings by federal judges .
The outlook is grim for a complete accounting of the Bush administration 's official communications , said Sheila Shadmand , counsel for the National Security Archive .
" The White House admitted it did nothing to stop people working in the White House from disposing of memory sticks , CDs , DVDs and zip drives that may have been the sole copies of missing e-mails on them , " she announced .
" We believe our ability to get a complete restoration of the White House record from 2003 to 2005 and evidence of what went wrong has been compromised . "
On Wednesday , the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted the National Security Archive an emergency motion to compel the Executive Office of the President to ramp up its search for all remaining computers and media that could be housing e-mails , especially those dated from March 2003 to October 2005 , so they can be properly transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration when President - elect Obama officially takes office on January 20 .
This decision comes after the April 24 , 2008 and July 29 , 2008 recommendations by Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola that U.S. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy order the surrender , search and preservation of White House and EOP computers and external media .
The National Security Archive and Citizens for Reponsibility and Ethics in Washington hailed the order and requested an inventory of external media devices , an inventory of backup tapes , a custodian to be appointed to secure the obtained records , an administrative record of the agencies ' actions and assurances from the White House and the EOP that they will follow the order .
" The White House will complain about the last minute challenge , but this is a records crisis of the White House 's own making , " said National Security Archive Director Tom Blanton .
The National Security Archive originally filed suit against the EOP and NARA on September 5 , 2007 in hopes of preserving and restoring the lost White House e-mails .
That suit would later be consolidated with a nearly identical one filed by CREW .
The timeframe of the missing correspondence includes the days surrounding the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame .
IT expert Steven McDevitt testified in February 2008 that as many as 1 million official E - mails had gone missing , and contrary to an estimate that 473 days ' correspondence was unaccounted for , the number was more like 1,000 .
CREW , in December 2007 , charged that the number of missing e-mails was closer to 10 million .
Administration officials , including former Bush advisor Karl Rove , also used RNC - administered e-mail accounts to conduct official business despite being directed to do so through official communication channels .
A Republican National Committee lawyer admitted in 2007 that at least four years ' worth of Rove 's e-mails had " gone missing . "
The Bush White House , RAW STORY reported last November , dismantled the records system put in place by President Clinton and replaced it with one that led to massive e-mail deletions .
In the ongoing quest to find and properly archive missing e-mails , the White House acknowledged that little has been done to make sure that all records will be properly preserved , despite previous rulings by federal judges .
The outlook is grim for a complete accounting of the Bush administration 's official communications , said Sheila Shadmand , counsel for the National Security Archive .
" The White House admitted it did nothing to stop people working in the White House from disposing of memory sticks , CDs , DVDs and zip drives that may have been the sole copies of missing e-mails on them , " she announced .
" We believe our ability to get a complete restoration of the White House record from 2003 to 2005 and evidence of what went wrong has been compromised . "

" Instead of coming clean and telling the public what they have been doing to solve the crisis , they refused to say anything .
At this point , it is critical to preserve evidence that can help get to the bottom of the problem and prevent it from happening again . "

In May 2008 , Manilatimes.net reported that the latest version of our very own Bayanihan Linux is about to be released .
According to the report :
Software programmers at the Advanced Science and Technology Institute of the Department of Science and Technology are now putting the finishing touches to the latest version of Bayanihan Linux .
In addition , a leading member of the Bayanihan Linux team said , “ Bayanihan Linux version 5 is slated for release by early 4th quarter , possibly on the first or second week of October , with the possibility of an offline edition of Wikipedia bundled with the upcoming academic edition . ”
With the year comes to an end , I ’m left wondering where the heck Bayanihan Linux 5.0 is .
I visited the BL project website and noticed that nothing much has changed since my last visit in August of 2007 .
Their forum is also very quiet with extremely low activity and plenty of unanswered posts .
Danny Garcia of
Danny Garcia of Dannybuntu tried to contact the Bayanihan Linux team via email to request for an interview ( to be published here at junauza.com ) but failed .
Since Danny ’s questions are too good to be ignored , I decided to publish them now .
Hopefully , someone from Bayanihan Linux will get to read this and can give us some answers .
Here ’s the content of Danny ’s email to Bayanihan :
Greetings ,
My name is Danny Garcia or dannybuntu .
Like you , I am a fellow Linux enthusiast who likes to write about Linux or FOSS related topics of general interest .
If possible , I would like to request for the opportunity to interview you guys , for me to know and publish on Junauza 's blog , an article related to the " Comeback of Bayanihan Linux " .
Here are the questions that I would like to pose , should you accept my request :
Part 1 : Government and Community
1 . The Philippine Linux crowd is growing bigger , what do you think could be the contribution of " Bayanihan Linux " a government sponsored Linux distribution , to the general Philippine Linux / Open Source community ?
2 . It is known that Bayanihan is government sponsored , in spite of this what do you think would be the role of the community at large - in the overall development and application of Bayanihan
Could the community contribute to the development of this project ?
If so , in what ways ?
3 . For a while , the Bayanihan project seems to have stagnated , in fact the website for Bayanihan
4 . Do you think being government funded is advantageous to the growth of Bayanihan Linux or is it constrained by government guidelines ?
So , is it safe to assume that if the government pulls the plug on Bayanihan , the project would just disappear ?
Who pays for the hosting and bandwidth ?
Part 2 : Distribution Specific Questions
1 . There are literally hundreds of Linux distributions that are available for Free to download on the Internet , if I am going to download Bayanihan , what are the reasons for me to download and use it for my everyday purposes instead of Ubuntu for example ?
2 . Some distributions , like Debian , integrate in their distributions mechanisms , which send user information back to the distribution 's home , for example Debian 's Popularity Contest .
Will Bayanihan send back information to the government about what we do with our computers ?
If yes , what kinds of information ?
3 . The latest version that is available to download is version 4 right ?
According to distrowatch.com , the release date for that version is 2007 - 03 - 28 .
Do you plan on updating anytime soon ?
What can we expect on the next version ?
Distributions such as Ubuntu , release updates on a regular timetable , does Bayanihan have a regular release timetable ?
Part 3 : Fun Stuff
1. 2001 is a long time , how many original team members are still on the project ?
2. Friendster , My Space or Facebook ? =D
Can we add you as our friend ?
3. Aside from Bayanihan , what stuff do you guys engage in ?
Do you play network multiplayer
4 . You are in Diliman Quezon City , how did you feel when Microsoft set up an Open Source Center at the National Computer Center ( NCC ) in Quezon City ?
5. Lastly , Richard Stallman or Linus Torvalds ?
Well guys and girls , thank you for your time in answering this simple email interview .
Good luck on your project and Long Live King Tux !
Until someone from Bayanihan can give us some answers , we can’t really tell what ’s happening out there and why the release of BL 5.0 has been greatly delayed .
I just hope that Bayanihan Linux will not become another government project with funds going straight inside Houdini ’s magic pocket .
Linux ?
literally disappeared for a while and no updates were available for quite a significant time - what happened ?
games ?

Unemployment in California rose sharply in December to 9.3 % , its highest level in 15 years , as the state ’s jobless rolls swelled to 1.7 million .
More than 78,000 people lost their jobs in December , and thousands more have received pink slips so far this month .
Economists said layoffs were likely to remain heavy during the first half of 2009 and could reach as high as 11 % .
Improvement could come later in the year , they noted , if the federal government starts pumping billions of dollars into the Golden State for public works and social programs .
On Friday , the state Employment Development Department reported that the jobless number jumped almost a full percentage point from 8.4 % in November .
It stood at 5.9 % a year earlier .
The rate for Los Angeles County , which like the state number is seasonally adjusted , was 9.9 % for December , up from a revised 8.9 % for November .
Joblessness topped 10 % in the Inland Empire , as it did in 31 of California ’s 58 counties .
Advertisement
Alarming as they are , the state ’s numbers tell only half the story .
They do n’t include the discouraged -- who have given up looking for a job -- the self - employed or people who work for cash , whose wages are not reported .
Although the U.S. Department of Labor wo n’t release state - by - state data until early next week , an informal survey ranked California as having the nation ’s third - worst unemployment , behind Michigan at 10.6 % and Rhode Island at 10 % .
“ We ’re going from bad to worse and then ugly , ” said Esmael Adibi , an economist with Chapman University in Orange .
“ It ’s going to be really nasty the next couple of quarters .
But if [ federal ] tax cuts kick in and there ’s a little infrastructure spending , hopefully the third and fourth quarters wo n’t be as bad . ”
Adibi stressed that a federal bailout could n’t come soon enough for a California economy that ’s been racked by lackluster holiday sales , continued drops in home values , waves of real estate foreclosures and a heightened tempo of layoffs at companies across all sectors of the economy .
Advertisement
“ The original weakness in construction and financial services is spilling over everywhere , ” Adibi said .
The widespread layoffs are turning job hunts into a desperate business for people such as Adriean Arreola , 27 , of Boyle Heights .
“ You ’ve got to stay positive , but the economy is falling , ” he said while looking for postings at a job center in north Los Angeles .
“ So , it can be hard . ”
Two months ago , Arreola lost his job at a computer disposal warehouse .
He said he ’s had to put his two children into foster homes until he can find a new job .
“ I ’ll take anything , ” he said .

The chances of Arreola finding a job are getting slimmer .
The pace of job losses has been accelerating from an average of 6,600 a month during the first half of 2008 to 36,400 a month in the second half of last year , said Howard Roth , chief economist for the state Department of Finance .
“ This thing is still getting worse , ” Roth said , adding that the unemployment rate could hit 11 % in 2009 .
The last time unemployment went that high was in February 1983 , when the state was pulling out of a severe recession .
Job cutbacks keep on coming .
In the first 10 days of this year , large and medium - size employers notified the California Employment Development Department that they planned to fire about 19,000 workers .
The layoffs are affecting industries of all kinds , large and small .

Boeing Co. announced satellite - related job cuts in El Segundo .
Circuit City consumer electronic stores are being closed all across California , as are organic juice plants in Azusa and Glendora .
Other major national employers that have sacked workers include American Airlines , AT&T ; Inc. , DHL Express Inc. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Adobe Systems Inc. , Yahoo Inc. and Target Corp .
In December , California hemorrhaged jobs in 10 of 11 industry categories tracked by the Employment Development Department : natural resources and mining ; construction ; manufacturing ; trade , transportation and utilities ; information ; financial activities ; professional and business services ; leisure and hospitality ; government ; and other services .
Even the area of education and healthcare , the single category that added jobs , gained only 2,300 jobs statewide for the month .
Health workers in Orange County have been particularly hard hit .
Among employers filing layoff notices with the state for January is the Irvine Regional Hospital and Medical Center , which reported that it planned to let 510 workers go this month .
“ At the moment , there ’s only one leg to stand on , ” hospitals and education , said Sung Won Sohn , an economist with Cal State Channel Islands .
“ And pretty soon there will be no leg . ”

Such widespread economic weakness puts California and the administration of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in a tough spot , Sohn said .
Only the federal government has the ability to borrow enough money to provide California with a short - term economic stimulus that can put tens of thousands of people back to work quickly , he said .
Boosting spending on construction , which lost 11 % of its jobs in the last year , is one of the fastest ways to get new money flowing through the economy , said Michael Bernick , a job - training specialist and former director of the state Employment Development Department .
Christopher Thornberg , principal of Los Angeles consulting firm Beacon Economics said the Obama administration had “ aggressive plans , ” and “ if they get in place early , they could actually get us moving again by the fourth quarter of 2009 . ”
That sort of turnaround would offer a bit of hope to Martin Talamantes , 40 , of Los Angeles , who was trained to install solar panels but has n’t been able to find a job for two months .

“ I ’m ready to get a job , but no one is hiring , ” he said .

In his 1748 essay “ Of Miracles , ” philosopher David Hume advised , “ A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence . ”
That is , how certain we are about something we ’re told should be directly correlated with how good the evidence is for that claim .
That is not only a basic premise of skepticism , but is also common sense .
Yet when this self - evident principle is applied to paranormal topics , some people dismiss it out of hand .
For example , in a new New Age book called " Amazing Grace : The Nine Principles of Living in Natural Magic , " by David Wolfe and Nick Goode , the authors try to dismiss skepticism with the following argument :
“ The mere idea that every single ghost experience , Bigfoot sighting , UFO encounter , alien abduction , psychic occurrence of any kind , Loch Ness monster viewing , conspiracy theory , etc. , is the product of a neurosis or hallucination is patently and completely ridiculous .
The burden of proof is clearly on the doubter .
The doubter must prove that every single paranormal experience out of thousands or even millions of such encounters in each category is a phony .
That is impossible … .
If even one ghost story is true , then ghosts exist .
If even one person can see into the future , then seeing into the future is possible .
This is ‘ Raw Logic ’ and it instantly deconstructs and eliminates any fog of confusion surrounding paranormal phenomenon ” ( page 8 - 9 ) .
There ’s a lot fuzzy thinking and bad logic packed into this paragraph .
First , the authors use a logical fallacy called the “ straw man argument ” when they suggest that skeptics ( “ doubters ” ) claim that every single paranormal experience “ is the product of a neurosis or hallucination . ”
Of course such a suggestion is patently ridiculous ; I do n’t know of a single skeptic who claims that all such experiences are neuroses or hallucinations .
They also commit another logical error , a false - choice fallacy , when they claim that either 1 ) all reports of the paranormal are the products of neuroses or hallucinations ; or 2 ) the phenomenon is “ true ” and actually occurred as claimed .
In fact , there ’s a third choice that Wolfe and Goode ignore , and it ’s the correct one : most “ unexplained phenomena ” are the product of simple misunderstandings , misperceptions , or errors in memory .
The authors then claim that the burden of proof is on the doubter , as if it ’s the skeptic ’s job to somehow disprove a given paranormal claim .
This is a common defense among those who are asked for evidence of their extraordinary claims , but that ’s not how science works .
That ’s not how courts of law work ( the burden of proof is not on the defendant to prove he is innocent , it is up to the court — the entity making the claim of guilt — to prove he is guilty ) .
According to Wolfe and Goode , if a friend tells you that she has a tiny , fire - breathing dragon living in her purse , you should assume that whatever you ’re being told is absolutely true , and the burden of proof is on you to disprove it !
That ’s not “ Raw Logic , ” that ’s Ill Logic .
The authors are correct that if even one lake monster or ghost sighting is true ( i.e. , the person actually saw something unexplainable ) , then lake monsters and ghosts exist .
But this is an obvious truism , circular logic offered up as profound insight that somehow dismisses or “ deconstructs ” any skeptical arguments .
It does nothing of the sort , and if there is a “ fog of confusion ” surrounding paranormal phenomena , it is caused by fuzzy thinking , bad logic , and a lack of critical thinking .
Sadly , it ’s all too common .
The Cape Wind project in Massachusetts cleared its biggest hurdle to date on Friday when the U.S. Minerals Management Service gave final environmental approval to the 450 megawatt offshore wind farm .
The eight year - old battle for what would be the country ’s first offshore wind farm may finally be nearing an end as the long - awaited Final Environmental Impact Statement reported negligible to minor impacts across all but one of the 27 resource areas studied .
The impact on marine birds was the only one judged to have anything above negligible to minor environmental impacts .
Taken in full , MMS found the project would have no significant environmental impacts .
[ social_buttons ]
Needless to say , Cape Wind supporters enthusiastically welcomed the decision .
The project ’s developer , Jim Gordon the CEO of Cape Wind Associates said “ Massachusetts is one major step closer to becoming home to America ’s first offshore wind farm and becoming a global leader in the production of offshore renewable energy . ”
The release of today ’s EIS represents the second such study conducted by the federal government .
In 2005 the Department of the Interior conducted an EIS for Cape Wind that was essentially annulled by the passage of the 2005 Energy Policy Act .
The ruling meant that an entirely new EIS would have to be conducted by the Minerals Management Service , the agency that was given regulatory jurisdiction over offshore wind farms .
Pending an almost certain approval from the incoming Obama administration , the project still awaits decisions by the Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. Coast Guard on whether it would interfere with airplane and marine radar .
Past studies by the F.A.A. found no real threat , but Jim Peters , an agency spokesman , said that officials visiting the site last summer found some evidence of possible electromagnetic interference .
Based on previous official statements from the Coast Guard , there is good reason to believe that the effects on marine radar will be deemed negligible .
Cape Wind opponents vowed to keep on fighting the 130 - turbine , 450 - megawatt project despite overwhelming support of 87 % of Cape Cod area residents .
>> See also : Massachusetts OKs 10 % Wind Power Requirement
Opponents will likely find a way to bring a lawsuit and are also awaiting the results of an investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Interior into the propriety of the environmental review process requested by “ Cape Cod residents . ”
Quick to respond to today ’s decision was longtime critic of the project , senior Massachusetts ’
Senator Edward Kennedy , who chided the action in a statement .
Kennedy said he did not do not believe that this action by the Interior Department will be sustained as it would assure “ years of continued public conflict and contentious litigation . ”
For Cape Wind opponents , the only threads of hope left to hold on to — unsubstantiated investigations of proper conduct , hopes for unfavorable reports from the FAA and Coast Guard , and statutory challenges with shaky legal footing — look a lot thinner after the release of today ’s report .

TURKISH POLICE arrested 39 people suspected of links to an alleged coup plot yesterday , as fears grew that what some dub the most important criminal investigation in Turkey ’s history is being undermined by political pressure and spiralling social tensions .
Five active army officers and 17 police , including special forces officers , were among the men detained in a dawn sweep across the country , broadcasters said .
Their arrest pushes the number of people detained since investigations started in June 2007 to more than 200 .
The trial of 86 people , including retired senior officers , accused of planning a string of high - level assassinations to destabilise the country and force military intervention , began last October .
Ergenekon , as Turks call the group , has divided the country since the start .
Some think it is a plot sponsored by the Islamic - rooted AK Party government to discredit rivals .
Others see it as a key test in EU candidate Turkey ’s march towards full democracy .
Tensions sky - rocketed earlier this month following the arrest of 40 men , including two retired top generals , a former head of Turkey ’s Higher Education Board , and a retired state prosecutor .
All four men played a key role in toppling an Islamist government , the predecessor of the current ruling party , in 1997 .
“ This is a regime change , like in the Khomeini and Hitler eras , ” the head of Turkey ’s secular chief opposition party Deniz Baykal said on January 10th .
The same day , Turkey ’s staunchly secular army chief called an unscheduled meeting with prime minister Tayyip Erdogan .
Two days later , the four men were released .
The meeting sparked widespread speculation that the military was stamping down on investigations .
In fact , the January 10th sweep appears to have given investigators a second wind .
“ They really hit the nail on the head , ” says Cuneyt Ulsever , a columnist for Hurriyet , Turkey ’s biggest daily .
He was referring to the arrest of former police special forces chief Ibrahim Sahin , and the discovery in his house of sketch maps that led to an arms cache on the outskirts of Ankara .
But Sahin ’s importance is much greater than the weapons he may or may not have buried in 2004 , analysts say .
Appointed police chief of a small central Anatolian town in 1980 , he procured passports for known ultra-nationalist killers , one of whom was involved in the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II a year later .
He reappeared alongside the same men in the 1990s , at the head of a new police special forces unit established to use extraordinary measures in the ongoing war against Kurdish separatists .
When the extent to which the state had dabbled in organised crime became clear in 1996 , Sahin was one of very few state officials sentenced to jail .
“ Follow Ibrahim Sahin ’s footsteps , and you have a chance to uncover the sources of the illegality at the heart of the Turkish state right back to the 1970s , ” says Can Dundar , a well - known broadcaster who has been following state - Mafia relations for over a decade .
“ With a well - run investigation , Turkey has the key now to clean up decades of dirt . ”
The problem is that the investigation is not being well handled .
The 2,450 - page indictment against the 86 suspects in the dock is a vague mishmash of different elements .
Analysts compare media coverage of Ergenekon to the organised campaign that preceded the toppling of the Islamist government in 1997 .
“ Back then , secular newspapers were full of leaked intelligence reports about fundamentalism , ” remembers Rusen Cakir , a leading journalist .
“ Now , pro-government newspapers are full of leaked reports about putschists .
This is not just an investigation .
It is a war , with psychological operations run by the police , and the media acting as police , prosecutor and judge . ”
Media irresponsibility claimed its first victim this Saturday when a retired senior military intelligence officer committed suicide at his Ankara home following reports in the press linking him to a series of unsolved murders during the 1990s .
The entire military high command turned out for his funeral .
Yet this display of solidarity does n’t necessarily mean army chiefs are taking sides over the investigation .
In fact , the army began cleansing itself of putschist elements long before Ergenekon kicked off .
Informed of two coup plans in 2003 and 2004 , the then chief of staff Hilmi Ozkok blocked both , and began sidelining the leaders .
The current army chief has a reputation for being a much more hawkish secularist , but he has not blocked investigations .
Two retired top generals arrested last year were taken by police from their flats in a military compound , something that would have been unthinkable just five years ago .
With the army the backbone of Turkey ’s strategic relationship with the West and the US , it efforts to cleanse itself are understandable .
All the officers arrested in connection with Ergenekon seek an end to Turkey ’s Nato membership and EU bid and closer relations with Russia , China and even Iran .
Hilmi Ozkok has made it clear he is willing to give evidence in court regarding the coup attempts he foiled in 2003 and 2004 .
Why , analysts ask , has n’t the prosecutor called him , given that the two suspected ring leaders have been in custody for nearly a year .
For Murat Yetkin , Ankara bureau chief of the liberal secularist daily Radikal , the answer is simple .
“ Rather than trying to uncover the truth , [ the prosecutor ] is trying to fit facts to his preconceived ideas , ” he says .
A former AKP minister , President Abdullah Gul met leading politicians , judges and army officers on Wednesday to calm frayed nerves .
“ Many people ’s names are being used by newspapers and TV stations in a very irresponsible way , ” he said before the meeting .
“ The press should act very cautiously . . .
Not doing so may lead to a polarisation of the country , which would damage Turkey greatly . ”
Can Dundar fears Mr Gul ’s intervention comes too late .
He thinks Ergenekon has turned into a trial of force between the government and secularists in the army and judiciary .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Wells Fargo reported a $ 2.6 billion fourth - quarter loss Wednesday , hurt by its acquisition of Wachovia and rising credit costs .
But excluding a host of charges , many of them related to the merger , earnings beat Wall Street estimates .
The San Francisco - based bank posted a loss of 79 cents a share , down from $ 1.36 billion , or 41 cents a share , during the same period a year ago .
Excluding the numerous charges , the company would have reported a profit of 41 cents .
That topped consensus estimates of 33 cents per share on that basis .
Wells Fargo chief financial officer Howard Atkins said in a statement that a big addition to the company 's credit reserves , as well as a $ 3.9 billion provision related to its purchase of Wachovia , were the main reasons for the quarterly loss .
He called the loss " disappointing . "
But the company also revealed Wednesday that it had no plans to ask for additional government capital .
Wells received $ 25 billion last year from the Treasury Department .
The bank added it would not cut its dividend , even as some analysts speculated the company would have to do so in order to conserve capital .
That news helped send Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) stock sharply higher .
Shares of the bank , which have lost 45 % of their value so far this year , soared nearly 28 % higher in afternoon trading .
Bank stocks were broadly higher Wednesday on speculation that the Obama administration was finalizing plans to create a so - called " bad bank " that would purchase toxic assets from large financial institutions .
Many investors had feared in recent weeks that conditions in the banking industry had become so severe that the government may have to nationalize some banks .
" That cloud seems to be lifting now , " said Brian Gardner , an analyst for investment firm Keefe , Bruyette & Woods .
" People are starting to understand what the administration is generally going to propose . "
A closer look
After several of its peers , including Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , reported substantial losses in recent weeks , many analysts were anticipating the worst from Wells Fargo .
Driving those fears was the company 's all - stock purchase of Wachovia , which was announced in October and completed in December .
Had Wachovia remained an independent company , it would have reported a loss of $ 11.2 billion in the fourth quarter .
Wells Fargo moved to clean up Wachovia 's books during the quarter , taking $ 37.2 billion in writedowns on nearly $ 94 billion of high - risk loans .
Top executives at the bank seemed encouraged about the progress being made on the merger , saying it was , for the most part , ahead of schedule .
" I feel better about this deal now than I did when it was first announced , " Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf said during a recorded investor conference call Wednesday .
Nonetheless , the deteriorating U.S. economic environment , marked by higher unemployment , weighed on Wells ' results , particularly in its home equity loan and its credit card portfolios .
Overall net charge - offs , or loans a bank does n't think are collectable , more than doubled from a year ago .
" That 's not pretty because Wells has been so much more conservative than many others , " said Bart Narter , an analyst for the Boston - based financial research and consulting firm Celent .
Wells , along with rival JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , has been viewed as one of the better - run big banks during the ongoing crisis .
The company 's profits have beaten Wall Street expectations for the past three quarters .
But in a sign that the economy could deteriorate further , Wells Fargo said it set aside a total of $ 5.6 billion during the quarter to cope with future loan losses , with $ 3.9 billion of that total tied to the Wells - Wachovia merger .
The company also revealed it was not immune to the Ponzi scheme allegedly committed by Bernard Madoff , adding that it took $ 294 million in charges during the quarter related to the fraud .

The New York Times has just announced its new Congress API , which provides capability for developers to access to four sets of data about US Congressional representatives and their votes : " a list of members for a given Congress and chamber , details of a specific roll - call vote , biographical and role information about a specific member of Congress , and a member ’s most recent positions on roll - call votes " ( see Congress API profile for details ) .
The data the API provides " data comes directly from the U.S. House and Senate Web sites , and is updated throughout the day while Congress is in session . "
And for individual member responses , the Times " include a numeric ID assigned by GovTrack , a free and open - source service that monitors legislative activity . "
The Times team also describes a bit about the coding going on behind the scenes :
It 's a RESTful API with data returned in XML .
You 'll need an API key to use it and up to 5000 daily requests are available for free .
This is another innovative API from the Times , who now offer a variety of useful APIs .
See our New York Times API Directory for a listing .
As Josh Catone notes , while , as a " dead - tree " newspaper the New York Times might be " running on fumes , " they 've :
been doing a lot of cool stuff with all the data they and others have collected over the years .
... [ the Congress API ] has a database of House votes back to 1991 and Senate votes dating to 1989 , as well as membership information going back to 1983 and 1947 , respectively .
More from Stephanie Condon at CNET and Marc Canter .
This API is another notable step in making government data accessible to developers .
Along with efforts by the Sunlight Foundation , Vivek Kundra in Washington D.C. , and the UK government , more of these opportunities are opening - up .
Expect to see more government mashups coming soon .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Congressional Democrats flexed their new political muscle Wednesday as the House of Representatives passed legislation expanding the State Children 's Health Insurance Program by more than $ 32 billion over five years .
The House passed the SCHIP bill on Wednesday , and the Senate will take it up next week .
The SCHIP bill , which will be taken up by the Senate next week , passed by a vote of 289-139 .
House Democrats provided almost unanimous support ; a strong majority of House Republicans were opposed .
" In this moment of crisis , ensuring that every child in America has access to affordable health care is not just good economic policy , but a moral obligation we hold as parents and citizens , " President - elect Barack Obama said in a statement released after the vote .
" I hope that the Senate acts with the same sense of urgency so that it can be one of the first measures I sign into law , " he said .
SCHIP covers more than 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who ca n't afford private insurance .
The bill 's supporters say the legislation would extend the program to an estimated 4 million additional children , paying for it with a 61 - cent - per - pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes .
Passing an expansion of SCHIP early in Obama 's presidency , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said , would be " a very dramatic and important statement that change has come to America . "
" Children are our treasure , " said Rep. John Dingell , D - Michigan .
" The bill is only the beginning .
...
We must not stop until all Americans qualify for quality , affordable health care . "
Opponents of the bill argued that , among other things , it discriminates against physician - owned specialty hospitals , will allow undocumented immigrants to illegally access taxpayer - financed healthcare , and is insufficiently funded .
" Increasing the cigarette tax ... does not , will not , and cannot cover the costs of this program , " Rep . Dave Camp , R - Michigan , said .
" The impending tax increases ... will have us all in a severe coughing fit . "
Funding the bill through cigarette taxes is " irrational , " added Rep. Wally Herger , R - California , because it " finances a growing program through a declining revenue source . "
President Bush vetoed two similar bills in 2007 , arguing at the time that the legislation would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded , state - run program .

German Anti-Globalization Campaigner ' We 're Not Paying For Your Crisis ! '
Anger rises in Germany as the economy falls .
Trade unions and globalization - critical protesters are planning demonstrations in Berlin and Frankfurt under the banner : " We 're not paying for your crisis . "
Alexis Passadakis , 31 , an activist from the group Attac , tells SPIEGEL what 's wrong with the system .
Gordon Brown came under pressure yesterday to impose a British arms embargo on Israel in protest at its actions in Gaza , and to call on the EU to join the boycott .
The call was made by Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , in an article in the Guardian , and represents the first serious political pressure on the prime minister to do more to condemn Israel .
Clegg accused Brown of sitting on his hands and speaking like an accountant about the crisis , remarks that were likely to deeply offend the prime minister .
Downing Street insists that Brown has been acting tirelessly behind the scenes alongside Tony Blair , now a Middle East envoy , and the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , to secure a ceasefire that the Israeli government will accept , including an international force to police the tunnels reportedly taking weapons into Gaza .
The Labour MP Richard Burden said that 100 parliamentarians had signed a letter condemning the attacks on Gaza .
But Clegg , ahead of an expected Commons statement on Monday by the foreign secretary , David Miliband , writes in the Guardian : " The EU is by far Israel 's biggest export market , and by far the biggest donor to the Palestinians .
It must immediately suspend the proposed new co-operation agreement with Israel until things change in Gaza , and apply tough conditions on any long - term assistance to the Palestinian community .
" Brown must also halt Britain 's arms exports to Israel , and persuade our EU counterparts to do the same .
The government 's own figures show Britain is selling more and more weapons to Israel , despite the questions about the country 's use of force .
In 2007 , our government approved £ 6 m of arms exports .
In 2008 , it licensed sales 12 times as fast : £ 20 m in the first three months alone .
" There is a strong case that , given the Gaza conflict , any military exports contravene EU licensing criteria .
Reports , though denied , that Israel is using illegal cluster munitions and white phosphorus , should heighten our caution .
I want an immediate suspension of all arms exports from the EU , but if that cannot be secured Brown must act unilaterally . "
He wrote that it was intolerable that Brown , like Blair , was making UK policy subservient to the US and condemned what he described as " the aching silence " of the US president - elect , Barack Obama .
The 64DD is Nintendo's answer to CD - Rom : A writable disk drive with fast access rates
The unit fits snugly underneath your N64 See this slot under your N64 ?
That 's where the two connect
The disks for the 64DD look a lot like Zip - Disks We 've been nominated !
Your vote makes a difference !
Nintendo 64DD
What is the 64DD ?
More than two years ago , Nintendo announced that it was working on a custom - made disk - drive add - on for its upcoming Project Reality , the code name for Nintendo 64 .
The 64DD ( 64 - megabyte disk drive ) is a hardware unit that fits snugly under the Nintendo 64 .
If you check the bottom of your Nintendo 64 , there 's a removable slot called " Ext . "
This is where the 64DD attaches to the N64 .
Basically , the 64DD is a magnetic drive - based device that uses media units very similar to Zip Drive disks .
A simplified comparison is to see them as gigantic floppy disks , holding 64 megabytes of data each .
These disks are not CD - ROMs ( Compact Disks -- Read Only Memory ) , and wo n't play CDs , like the Saturn and PlayStation .
What Will It Do ?
A really cool thing about 64DD is that it enables developers to make games that can utilize both cartridge and disk .
For instance , if Acclaim created a football game on cartridge , it would later be able to produce updates for it on disk .
These disks could feature such things as new graphics data , new teams , arenas and presentation screens , and new information such as player 's names , team colors , team stats , new players and so on .
This update disk would obviously be much cheaper than a cartridge , and would allow players to get much more out of their games and not have to buy a new cartridge every year .
The same holds true for other games , like RPGs : new adventures or worlds , or even new characters , for instance , could be created to add extra life to a game .
But developers also have the option of making 64DD disk only games , and skip the cartridge version altogether .
So they have three choices for development : straight carts , disk and cart , or straight disk .
The other big advantage of the 64DD disk is that it is readable and writeable .
CD - ROMs ( remember that ROM means Read Only Memory ) can't perform this function and need an additional memory pak to record data ( and then only in small quantities ) .
So , for example , in a 64DD RPG your character could be walking through a forest and drop a few cookie crumbs to mark the way .
Any change is instantly recorded , and even when you turn off the game and later come back to it the crumbs will still be there .
Maybe your footprints will still be there , too .
Monsters you killed could be there and their rotting corpses could still be decaying .
In essence , your game , once you start playing it , will be completely unique .
With the flexibility of the 64DD , and more importantly , the rewritability of disks , your 64DD - compatible cart games will really become far more valuable then ever before .
When Will It Arrive ?
Nintendo officially announced last spring that the 64DD will appear first in Japan in March 1998 .
Since then , the release date has slipped to June ' 98 .
Nintendo's official word on the 64DD in the US is so vague , people 's faces usually crinkle up in frustration and despair : " The official word is that Nintendo 's 64DD is coming out in 1998 .
No games have been announced yet , and no firm date has been disclosed . "
We here at IGN64.com think that the 64DD will not come out in 1998 -- but we would love to be wrong on this .
At Shoshinkai Ď96 , Perrin Kaplan ( Nintendo's Director of Corporate Communications ) told IGN reporters that the 64DD will arrive by the end of 1997 .
The launch date for the 64DD in Japan has already been moved back at least twice .
Now Nintendo of America says the 64DD will be out in North America sometime in 1998 , and might possibly be revealed at the June Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta , Georgia .
But will it really ?
Only time will tell .
How much will it cost ?
Nintendo has not yet revealed the DD 's exact price .
Early estimates put the price for the unit alone at around $ 99 in Japan .
But industry insiders told IGN64 .
com that Nintendo is trying to keep the cost as low as possible ( hence the rather limited storage ) and that we might even see the drive for a mere $ 79 in the US .
Why Not CD - ROMs ?
Nintendo has always said that cartridges are the best way to bring a game to life on videogame consoles .
Third - party developers , however , almost unanimously disagree , especially after experiencing the inexpensive production costs and higher profit margins of making games for CD - ROM - based systems .
Some were even reluctant to make Nintendo 64 games , period .
Electronic
Arts was one of these companies until Nintendo worked a deal to bring all of EA 's biggest sports titles to Nintendo 64 .
That was a major coup for Nintendo , especially since EA had previously said it would n't make any Nintendo 64 games at all ( with the exception of FIFA ) .
Many developers , however , are very interested in making games for the 64DD ( and are confused why Nintendo does n't actively push for more DD development ) .
64DD disks much cheaper for developers / publishers and offer higher profit margins than carts .
On top of that , disks allow for far bigger and better games to be created -- the extra storage space afforded by a disk ( the largest cartridge so far has 32 megabytes of storage space compared to 64 MB on a 64DD disk ) and a RAM expansion that ships with the unit pave the way for better music , speech and graphics .
But this still does n't answer the " why not CD - ROMs " question ?
The fact of the matter is that Nintendo turned sour on CD - ROM after a deal with Sony to produce a CD - ROM drive for the Super NES blew up ( the remains of which became known as the PlayStation ) .
This , coupled with the fact that Nintendo wants games for its machine to be delivered exclusively on Nintendo - manufactured media ( CD - ROMs can be made by anyone with access to a CD pressing plant ) has ensured that Nintendo has bucked the CD trend so far .
Nintendo has only ever really said that cartridges have benefits that CD - ROMs do n't , and while many gamers somehow believed this ( qualities like fast loading games and durability ) , most developers , executives , and knowledgeable tech heads simply chuckled .
The simple fact is that CD - ROMs have much more storage space , are easier to mass produce and provide a far more forgiving business model ( they allow for a far bigger profit margin ) than cartridges will ever .
Even the size of Zelda 64 , which holds 32 megabytes on one single cartridge , simply does n't compare to a standard 650 megabyte CD - ROM .
Size , of course , says nothing about the quality of the gameplay ...
Will it sell ?
What 's so special about Nintendo 's infamous 64DD ?
What separates this add - on device from the 32Xs and Sega CDs of yore ?
Unlike so many failed peripherals and add - ons , the 64DD does n't merely offer more of the same .
It takes a step into a new direction -- one virtually unexplored in the home videogaming community : writability .
And that at a low price .
The ability to store mass amounts of data on the writable drive opens new doors for developers and players alike .
We 're not talking about simple save - game features here -- that is merely the tip of the iceberg .
No , imagine add - on missions to games , extra levels , new weapons , virtual pets , characters and storylines and worlds that unfold differently every time the game is played .
Theoretically , with the use of the 64DD , it is possible for Nintendo to distribute monthly add - ons or updates to existing games .
Replay value would jump to new heights .
Together with another peripheral , the Capture Cartridge , it will actually be possible to bring your own face into a game .
Simply grab a frame from video , edit it in one of Nintendoís Mario Artist games , and youíre ready to use it in other games supporting this 64DD feature .
Imagine a fighting game with a character that has your face -- you get the picture .
But that 's not all .
Nintendo is also planning to sell the 64 GB pak , a device that allows you to import data from a GameBoy game to the 64DD -- and you will even be able to directly connect GameBoys to your N64 to use them as data sheets for games like horse - racing or baseball ( where the other player is n't supposed to see what you enter ) .
The question remains if Nintendo can pull it off and sell the 64DD at high quantities to attract enough third party developers .
Additional Features Built - in ROM
The 64DD includes a 36 - megabit - chip that contains integrated fonts and audio data files .
No longer will programmers have to put ALL their sounds into a cart as is currently the case ( the N64 lacks a dedicated sound chip ) .
This will eliminate the need for developers to store many sounds and fonts on the disk and free up even more space .
Real - Time Clock
An interesting feature of the 64DD is that it has an internal real - time clock that is always ticking .
Play a game at night , switch it off , and upon returning in the morning , eight hours will have passed in the game .
Enough time for a village to be burned down , or for characters to regain health while resting , or an enemy to sneak up behind players for a surprise attack .
Welcome to the real virtual world .
This feature is likely to be used a lot with virtual pet sims and to unlock special time - bound features , like a winter - time level at X - Mas time , and more .
Memory Expansion
The 64DD comes with a 4 MB expansion RAM ( random access memory ) pack , which players install into the memory expansion slot of the Nintendo 64 ( top ) .
It will replace the current jumper pak and raise the N64ís overall RAM to a total of 8 MB ( four times as much as the PSX ) .
Among other things , the added RAM will help pave the way for more hi-res games .
Modem , Network or Satellite ?
The other , more mysterious part of the 64DD is that it is supposed to feature modem or network capability .
A modem could open the ways to multiplayer gaming or network downloads , but it does throw up a myriad of questions -- will the 64DD have a modem built in ?
Will the 64DD use the Internet or a specific Nintendo gaming network ( perhaps satellite based ) ?
And the big question -- will this ultimately allow gamers to play other gamers around the world ?
Sega has released its share of modems for its consoles , but all have lacked the benefit of writability .
64DD owners , presumably , will possibly be able to connect to a network and play against other players , or even be able to download add - ons , upgrades , cheats and tweaks .
So what will it be , modem , modem connection , a software modem , or some alternate network ?
Our guess is that the Japanese version will ultimately hook up to Nintendo's new Satellite joint venture ( for data downloading and TV / Videotext - type programming ) and that the US version will possibly offer a " software modem " for downloading data from dedicated servers .
Unfortunately , Nintendo continues to give conflicting reports .
Some NCL employees say there will definitely not be a modem in either the Japanese and the international version of the 64DD , NOA says there will be .
We will just have to wait on this one .

Sue for Libel ?
by Walter Block by Walter Block
DIGG THIS
Should I sue the bad guys for libel ?
There is nothing I would like more .
These people have , indeed , engaged in such acts , at least according to several lawyer friends of mine .
For example , Fr. Linnane , S.J. , President of Loyola College in Maryland said that neither he nor the institution he heads up would " endorse or support racism , sexism or any other form of intolerance , " in a context where he clearly claims I am guilty of such .
A letter signed , presumably , by the entire economics department of this college ( actually , two of its members , Prof. Tom DiLorenzo , and Prof. Hank Hilton , S.J. , chairman of this department , refused to sign it ) characterized my lecture ( which most of them did not even attend ) , as follows : " insensitive , " " incorrect , " " offensive , " " racially insensitive , " " poor - quality scholarship , " ( guilty of ) " gender … ( and ) … racial prejudice . "
And then , to add insult to injury , my own Loyola University New Orleans colleagues , the members of our Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force , piled on with a " statement " to the effect that I have no " commitment to inclusion " and that I " marginalize women and African Americans " ; that I do not want to " instill … in every one of our students a desire to pursue excellence " ; that I do not appreciate " the valuable contributions of " some ethnic , racial and gender groups ; that my remarks are " flawed " and , even , " dangerous . "
Needless to say , none of the members of this " Task Force " attended my lecture , either .
Further , there was a rash of letters to the editor of the Times Picayune newspaper , which , charitably , can be characterized as libelous condemnations of this lecture of mine , which of course , none of them had attended .
Oh , yes ; there is nothing I would want more than to sue these illegitimi for all they are worth , and then , of course , to donate the proceeds to the Mises Institute , without whose support I would not have been able to publicize these moral , spiritual , intellectual , and , yes , illegal outrages that have been perpetrated upon me .
However there is one barrier to doing so , at least for the libertarian .
While libel is indeed a crime on the law books , we libertarians are not legal positivists .
Not for us the notion that whatever the law is , is right .
No , members of our persuasion cast a piercing light on the extant legal codes , and do not at all support them en masse .
Rather , we pick and choose .
We claim they are legitimate only to the extent they accord with the twin pillars of libertarianism , private property rights based on homesteading , and the non initiation of aggression axiom .
How do libel laws stack up in this regard ?
Not too well .
In the view of Rothbard :
" Does Smith have the right to disseminate false information about Jones ?
In short , should u2018 libel ’ and u2018 slander ’ be illegal in the free society ?
" … how can they be ?
Smith has a property right to the ideas or opinions in his own head ; he also has a property right to print anything he wants and disseminate it .
He has a property right to say that Jones is a u2018 thief ’ even if he knows it to be false , and to print and sell that statement .
The counter - view , and the current basis for holding libel and slander ( especially of false statements ) to be illegal is that every man has a u2018 property right ’ in his own reputation , that Smith ’s falsehoods damage that reputation , and that therefore Smith ’s libels are invasions of Jones ’s property right in his reputation and should be illegal .
Yet , again , on closer analysis this is a fallacious view .
For everyone , as we have stated , owns his own body ; he has a property right in his own head and person .
But since every man owns his own mind , he can not therefore own the minds of anyone else .
And yet Jones ’s u2018reputation ’ is neither a physical entity nor is it something contained within or on his own person .
Jones ’s u2018reputation ’ is purely a function of the subjective attitudes and beliefs about him contained in the minds of other people .
But since these are beliefs in the minds of others , Jones can in no way legitimately own or control them .
Jones can have no property right in the beliefs and minds of other people .
" Let us consider , in fact , the implications of believing in a property right in one ’s u2018reputation . ’
Suppose that Brown has produced his mousetrap , and then Robinson comes out with a better one .
The u2018reputation . ’ of Brown for excellence in mousetraps now declines sharply as consumers shift their attitudes and their purchases , and buy Robinson ’s mousetrap instead .
Can we not then say , on the principle of the u2018reputation ’ theory , that Robinson has injured the reputation of Brown , and can we not then outlaw Robinson from competing with Brown ?
If not , why not ?
Or should it be illegal for Robinson to advertise , and to tell the world that his mousetrap is better ?
In fact , of course , people ’s subjective attitudes and ideas about someone or his product will fluctuate continually , and hence it is impossible for Brown to stabilize his reputation by coercion ; certainly it would be immoral and aggressive against other people ’s property right to try .
Aggressive and criminal , then , either to outlaw one ’s competition or to outlaw false libels spread about one or one ’s product .
" We can , of course , readily concede the gross immorality of spreading false libels about another person .
But we must , nevertheless , maintain the legal right of anyone to do so .
Pragmatically , again , this situation may well redound to the benefit of the people being libeled .
For , in the current situation , when false libels are outlawed , the average person tends to believe that all derogatory reports spread about people are true , u2018 otherwise they ’d sue for libel . ’
This situation discriminates against the poor , since poorer people are less likely to file suits against libelers .
Hence , the reputations of poorer or less wealthy persons are liable to suffer more now , when libel is outlawed , then they would if libel were legitimate .
For in that libertarian society since everyone would know that false stories are legal , there would be far more skepticism on the part of the reading or listening public , who would insist on far more proof and believe fewer derogatory stories than they do now .
Furthermore , the current system discriminates against poorer people in another way ; for their own speech is restricted , since they are less likely to disseminate true but derogatory knowledge about the wealthy for fear of having costly libel suits filed against them .
Hence , the outlawing of libel harms people of limited means in two ways : by making them easier prey for libels and by hampering their own dissemination of accurate knowledge about the wealthy . "
I , too , am on record as opposing the criminalization libel .
In my book Defending , I state :
" Now , there is perhaps nothing more repugnant or vicious than libel .
We must , therefore , take particular care to defend the free speech rights of libelers , for if they can be protected , the rights of all others — who do not give as much offense — will certainly be more secure .
But if the rights of free speech of libelers and slanderers are not protected , the rights of others will be less secure .
" The reason civil libertarians have not been involved in the protection of the rights of libelers and slanderers is clear — libel is ruinous to reputations .
Harsh tales about lost jobs , friends , etc. , abound .
Far from being concerned with the free speech rights of the libeler and slanderer , civil libertarians have been concerned with protecting those who have had their reputations destroyed , as though that in itself was unpardonable .
But obviously , protecting a person ’s reputation is not an absolute value .
" If it were , if , that is , reputations were really sacrosanct , then we would have to prohibit most categories of denigration , even truthful ones .
Unfavorable literary criticism , satire in movies , plays , music or book reviews could not be allowed .
Anything which diminished any individual ’s or any institution ’s reputation would have to be forbidden …
" … what is a person ’s ‘ reputation ’ ? …
Clearly , it is not a possession which may be said to belong to him in the way , for example , his clothes do .
In fact , a person ’s reputation does not ‘ belong ’ to him at all .
A person ’s reputation is what other people think of him ; it consists of the thoughts which other people have .
" A man does not own his reputation any more than he owns the thoughts of others — because that is all his reputation consists of .
A man ’s reputation cannot be stolen from him any more than can the thoughts of other people be stolen from him . "
“ Whether his reputation was ‘ taken from him ’ by fair means or foul , by truth or falsehood , he did not own it in the first place and , hence , should have no recourse to the law for damages .
" What then are we doing when we object to , or prohibit , libel ?
We are prohibiting someone from affecting or trying to affect the thoughts of other people .
But what does the right of free speech mean if not that we are all free to try to affect the thoughts of those around us ?
So we must conclude that libel and slander are consistent with the rights of free speech . "
Thus , while I would like , more than almost anything else , to meet these defamatory people in a court of law , in my opinion libertarian principles prevent me from so doing .
But , am I not being too extreme ?
Is not logical consistency the hob goblin of little minds ?
And , has not the great Murray Rothbard opined that every dog gets one bite : a person can still be considered a libertarian even if he acts inconsistently with this doctrine on one issue .
Why not make libel laws my one exception ?
This will not do , for I have already compromised on libertarian principle .
I have previously given up on anarcho capitalism , a logical implication of the twin libertarian axioms .
I am on record as saying that government is justified ( I did this in one of my lectures at the Mises University ; if you want to see lots of similar compromises with principle , attend this seminar ) .
That is , I have favored limited government .
Well , strictly - limited government .
My claim is that the state should have only one function : to compel everyone to read the books of Mises and Rothbard .
But not only read them : understand them , too .
To that end , the government should set up quiz centers to ensure comprehension of books such as Human Action and Man , Economy and State ( please , the scholar ’s editions of each ) , and jail sentences ( take that , Stephan Kinsella and Dan D’Amico ! ) for those who fail to fully understand these books .
So , you see , gentle reader , being guilty of one deviation , I dare not add a second to my record .
Is there any way out of this morass ?
Is there a path that will allow me to both have my cake and eat it too ?
That is , sue u2018em , but , somehow , do so in a way that is compatible with libertarian principles ?
Consider the following attempts ( all suggested to me by friends of mine ) in this regard .
I fear they all fail , but I am certainly open to all such attempts .
" I do n’t see how suing these rascals for libel conflicts with libertarian thought .
We believe in economic compensation for wrongs done to us , right ? "
Well , not exactly .
The only wrongs for which forced compensation is justified under libertarianism involve a violation of either private property rights or the non aggression axiom .
Does libel , lying about someone ’s views in this case , constitute such a violation ?
I think not .
Fr. Linnane , S.J. , did not punch me in the mouth , nor steal my car .
Yes , he besmirched something even more valuable to me , far more valuable , my reputation , but , still , I do n’t own my reputation ( it consists of the thoughts of others about me ) , thus there is no wrong committed against my property rights .
" I ’m sure that you can figure this out so that you may avoid this criticism while using the threat of this action and the sure outcome to defend your opinion — as well as your method of teaching . "
Here is another version of this attempt : " I do n’t think that you must see it all the way through .
When they realize that they cannot win , they will back out of court .
You get the judgment ( compensation ) for damages to your career , etc .
They shut the hell up .
( The ultimate ideal would be that they back down , make public apologies , and after that , you forgive them for the debt — doubt that a lawyer would agree to this — so , how about they apologize publicly , in writing — in newspapers , even if it costs them money — then you take their compensation and donate it to some good charity ? "
That sounds like a great idea : threaten to bring a libel suit against these worthies , but do not carry through .
That is , perhaps , have a lawyer send them a letter with this threat , and hope that this will be sufficient to entice them to climb down from their present position .
At least offer an apology , and , perhaps , offer to settle out of court , since my case ( I have been assured by several lawyers ) is a strong one .
Very tempting ; even a public apology would go some way toward demonstrating to the politically correct crowd that they cannot bully everyone .
The problem with this from a libertarian perspective is that there is an intimate connection between what one may properly threaten , and what one may licitly do .
That is , it is impermissible to threaten to engage in act X , if you have no right to actually carry X out .
I have no right to threaten that unless you give me your wallet , I ’ll shoot you , because I have no right to shoot you in the first place .
On the other hand , if I do indeed have a right to do Y , then I have a right to threaten that I will do Y , unless you pay me money .
This insight is the key element of the libertarian analysis of blackmail .
In this case , since I have the right to gossip about you , I have the right to threaten to gossip about you , unless you pay me not to do so , which is all that blackmail consists of .
For further elaboration of this claim , see here , here , here , here , here and here .
" A libel suit is just a use of force .
It is arguably permissible if it is used defensively — e.g. in a counterclaim .
So — see if you can think of a case that these people are committing aggression against you — e.g. by supporting taxation etc . "
I would gladly do this .
And , yes , my tormentors all , certainly , support taxes .
But , that is all they did to me : libel .
They only libeled me .
They did n’t use coercion against me .
How I wish they had .
This reminds of the time when Robert Nozick used rent control legislation against Eric Segal , fellow Harvard professor , novelist ( Love Story ) , and his landlord .
The press had a field day with Nozick , under the heading of Anarchy , State and Rent Control , a take - off on the title of his famous book , Anarchy , State and Utopia .
Nozick was widely and properly condemned for his hypocrisy .
Suppose , however , contrary to fact conditional coming up here , that Segal had punched Nozick in the mouth , under conditions where this could not be proved .
Then , would Nozick have been justified in utilizing rent control provisions against Segal ?
I do not see why not .
As stated above " A libel suit is just a use of force . "
If violence was initiated by these people , then countermeasures , such as a libel suit , would be justified .
I only wish that some of these libelers had been guilty of a real crime ; I would not hesitate , then , to utilize libel law against them .
Alas , however , they did not , and thus I may not .
" Ask XX ( a lawyer ) about the libel law aspect .
These people deserve to have the ( bleep ) scared out of them , and Walter , the hell with u2018 no damages . ’
Sue them all for big bucks , and give the money to the Mises Institute . "
I fully agree with this friend of mine that these people deserve not only to have the ( bleep ) scared out of them , but to pay , and big .
Needless to say , I would donate any proceeds from a lawsuit along these lines to the MI .
( I had previously considered the possibility of suing them , merely , for an apology ; I have long since relinquished this idea . )
However , and this is a big however , I ’m having no little difficulty reconciling suing them for libel with libertarian theory , according to which libel is not a crime .
Suppose , arguendo , I were to sue for libel .
At whom would I direct my lawsuit ?
To the individuals involved ?
Fr. Linnane , S.J. has no money : zero .
As a Jesuit priest , he has sworn a vow of individual poverty ( but not group poverty : his Catholic order is a very wealthy one . )
On the other hand , he has violated , with impunity , Paragraph 22 of The Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius , which are the spiritual foundation of Jesuit life .
If he has transgressed against this one rule , why not others ?
Who knows how much money he has socked away , contrary to his vows of individual poverty ?
Well , likely , not too much , if any at all .
Certainly , I have no independent reason to suppose that Fr. Linnane , S.J. , has violated this one oath , just because he has ignored another .
My other libelers are mainly professors , and , probably , no one will get rich from suing any of them , or even all of them put together .
Why not , then , search for " deep pockets ? " Loyola University New Orleans and Loyola College in Maryland both have rather large endowment funds .
For that matter , I might as well sue the entire Jesuit order , if it is deep pockets at which I am aiming .
Unhappily for this trend of thought , seeking out such defendants would also be proscribed by libertarian considerations .
To wit , respondeat superior is incompatible with the individualist elements of libertarianism .
This is the doctrine according to which the employer ( the entire Jesuit Order , Loyola University New Orleans , Loyola College in Maryland , respectively ) is civilly responsible for the actions of his employees ( my several libelers , in this case ) .
Under libertarianism , in sharp contrast , people are only responsible for their own acts , not those of others .
For more on this , see here .
" Get someone else to do the suing .
If you are limited by your libertarian principles in this regard , there are others , friends of yours , who will not be so picky . "
There is precedent for this sort of thing .
In the Jewish tradition , there is the practice of the Shabbos goy .
This is a non Jew who is not bound by Halachic ( Hebrew ) law to , for example , refrain from turning lights on or off during Shabbos ( the Jewish Sabbath , which takes place between sunset Friday and sunset Saturday ) .
He can perform this service for a Jew without violating any rules that apply to either of them .
This , I confess , initially sounded to me like a " winner . "
At last , I could see the libelers writhe , score a few points against these bullies , strike a blow for freedom , and all this without running afoul of libertarian requirements .
Alas , u2018 twas not to be .
There is such a thing as " standing " in the law , and properly so .
This means that there must be some connection between the plaintiff and the harm done .
But , no one else has any standing , apart from me .
No one else ’s reputation was attacked .
I am not lawyer enough to know whether any other libertarian would have sufficient standing , based on only that fact ; even if so , there would still be logical difficulties here .
To the extent that such a person really was a libertarian , he would have standing , but would have to renounce all libel lawsuits , for reasons given above .
To the extent that such a person was willing to sue in my behalf , he would lose any vestige of standing that might or might not be according to any of my fellow libertarians ; he would no longer be one of our tribe .
" It is not you who are doing the libel .
It is they .
So , play by their rules .
I think in this case , you can play by their rules and still win .
It ’s the best of both worlds , no ? " I fear not .
To play by " their " rules is to renounce libertarian principle .
But , the point of the exercise I conducted in Baltimore was to promote liberty , not adopt their policies .
In other words , we want to achieve liberty in a very narrow and limited way : by using libertarian means , and only libertarian means .
To sue anyone for libel is to that extent to put paid to this .
So , what to do , what to do ?
If anyone has any suggestions , if anyone can mention another tack that I have missed , please let me know .
( By the way , unless otherwise told , I intend to blog some of the many magnificent letters I have received in response to this thread ; of course , on an anonymous basis .
Tom DiLorenzo has started this practice , and I intend to follow up on his lead . )
There is a course of action I have tentatively decided to embark upon .
Given that I cannot sue for libel as a libertarian , is there anything else I can do to bring these harassers down a peg or two ?
Yes .
I can go to ecclesiastic court .
Fr. Linnane , S.J. is a member in good standing of the Jesuit order .
Yet , he has violated its strictures .
The members of the economics department at Loyola College in Maryland are not Jesuits ( apart from their department chairman , Fr. Hilton , S.J. , who did not sign that letter ) , nor are those who comprise the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force of Loyola University New Orleans .
However , both sets of individuals are employed by these two Jesuit institutions of higher learning , and are , presumably , bound at least to some extent to follow practices of civility as required by the Jesuit order .
Surely , there must be some penalties meted out to those who so outlandishly set these aside .
However , I am now stepping way outside the bounds of my expertise , such as it is .
I need a lawyer well versed in ecclesiastical law to advise me on this matter .
If anyone knows of such a person , please ask him to contact me , and / or give me contact information about him .
A note on another matter .
In a previous column in this thread , I had occasion to say this : " Now , even mentioning IQ in the typical university setting ( apart from debunking the entire concept ) is , for many , akin to shouting out the F word in the drawing room .
Indeed , it is simply not done in “ polite ” society , in their view .
I beg to differ . "
My friend Gary North points out that most institutions of higher learning , certainly including both Loyola College in Maryland and Loyola University New Orleans rely , heavily , upon SAT and ACT scores in choosing their freshman classes .
But , SAT and ACT ratings are not unrelated to IQ .
It is more than passing curious , then , that members of each of these communities are so bitterly opposed to the latter , when they embrace the former as an everyday matter — well , every - year matter .
They are thus acting — how shall we put this politely ? — in a logically inconsistent manner .
Are they also racists and sexists for utilizing a concept ( SAT , ACT ) that is so highly correlated with the IQ score they hate and revile so much ?
They are , at least according to the limitations they have attempted to place upon me .
Logic , then , compels them to either cease and desist from employing SAT and ACT scores in their decision making , or , to withdraw the calumny they have placed at my door for merely mentioning IQ .

Microsoft ( MSFT ) recently initiated the first company - wide layoffs in its history , with 1,400 employees let go and an eye towards 5,000 position reductions within 18 months .
So with Microsoft scrutinizing itself so deeply , perhaps the company can finally admit it 's time to shutter the Zune .
Not the least because the Zune is doing even worse than we thought : Microsoft 's quarterly filings reveal Zune sales plunged 54 % year - over - year last holiday season , all the while Apple ( AAPL ) is selling more iPods than ever before .
And selling the Zune is going to be even harder going forwards :
The high - profile failure of Zune 30 GB models on New Year 's Eve due to a Y2 K - like bug is only going to spook consumers more .
We understand why Microsoft has insisted until they 're blue in the face they 're " deeply committed " to the Zune : Microsoft ( wisely ) realized no one would buy a Zune if they seemed ambivalent towards their own device .
But in light of the most recent numbers -- and Microsoft 's self - professed desire to cut costs -- there 's no point left in pretending the Zune 's not a failure .
Time for Microsoft to cut its losses and move on .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Statin drugs can reduce soaring cholesterol levels , according to countless ads touting these supposed " wonder " drugs , that means they are brimming with health benefits because they lower the risk of cardiovascular disease .
The problem is a host of side effects from eye problems and muscle pain to heart arrhythmias and liver disorders have been linked to these widely prescribed medications .
Now comes research by an Iowa State University scientist that strongly suggests statins also could be robbing brains of thinking power and memory by doing exactly what they are supposed to do -- reduce cholesterol .
It turns out that statins inhibit not only the liver from making cholesterol but may also block the brain from making cholesterol .
That 's a serious consequence , according to Yeon - Kyun Shin , a biophysics professor in the department of biochemistry , biophysics and molecular biology at Iowa State , because cholesterol is vital for healthy and optimum brain function .
" If you deprive cholesterol from the brain , then you directly affect the machinery that triggers the release of neurotransmitters .
Neurotransmitters affect the data - processing and memory functions .
In other words , how smart you are and how well you remember things , " said Dr. Shin in a statement to the media .
In a study published in the February issue of the journal , Dr. Shin and colleagues tested the activity of the neurotransmitter - release processes of brain cells without cholesterol present to see how well they functioned .
Then cholesterol was placed in the system and the scientists measured the transmitter function again .
The result ?
Cholesterol increased the neurotransmitter function by five times .
" Our study shows there is a direct link between cholesterol and the neurotransmitter release .
We know exactly the molecular mechanics of what happens in the cells .
Cholesterol changes the shape of the protein to stimulate thinking and memory , " Dr. Shin said in the press statement .
" If you try to lower the cholesterol by taking medicine that is attacking the machinery of cholesterol synthesis in the liver , that medicine goes to the brain too .
And then it reduces the synthesis of cholesterol which is necessary in the brain .
" However , just because cutting down on cholesterol in the brain may mess up memory and cognitive skills , it does n't mean that more cholesterol in the blood will make you more intelligent and able to remember more facts .
That 's because no matter how much cholesterol is in your diet , the cholesterol in the blood does n't cross over the blood brain barrier .
In addition , by loading a diet with saturated fat from animal products and junk food , too much low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , often called " bad " cholesterol , can build up in cells and cause hardening of arterial walls contributing to strokes and heart disease -- unless you have enough high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , or " good " cholesterol , to keep LDL out of cells .
Fortunately , there are many proven ways to lower the " bad " artery logging cholesterol without resorting to statin drugs .
For example , the Mayo Clinic web site notes garlic , ground flaxseed , barley and artichoke extract may be helpful in keeping cholesterol levels in healthy balance .

Commodities everywhere have been getting whacked and cocaine is no exception .
We have to imagine that demand has collapsed -- perhaps as former users switch to cheaper substitutes -- but prices are also following due to an increase in free trade .
Well , sort of .
BBC : The price of cocaine in Europe is set to fall even further as smugglers use new routes through West Africa and the Balkans , says the UN anti-drugs agency .
In its latest report , the International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) , said West Africa has become a " major hub " for South American cocaine smuggling .
UK officials said last week that the price of cocaine had fallen by half in the last 10 year .
The trade routes dovetail with what the report says is weak government intervention -- so again , as we said , free trade .
No word on whether growers in high - cost countries are asking for sanctions against the world 's low cost producers , but that should come soon .

Stress , the ever - present threat to health and happy living , is tough on the brain .
If the strain goes on too long , it can lead to debilitating psychological problems .
Part of the reason , according to scientists at The Rockefeller University , may have to do with a little - known family of proteins called kainate receptors that has recently been implicated in major depression .
New research in rats may help explain one mechanism by which stress reshapes the brain : namely , by ramping up production of a particular part of these proteins .
“ We ’ve recently seen large human studies that suggest kainate receptors are targets for response to certain antidepressants and are also involved in major depression and the susceptibility to suicidal thoughts , ” says Richard Hunter , a postdoctoral fellow in Bruce S. McEwen ’s Harold and Margaret Milliken Hatch Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology at Rockefeller .
“ We are trying to build up a molecular understanding of what is going on here . ”
In experiments published recently in a special issue of PLoS ONE , Hunter and his colleagues homed in on one of five subunits of the kainate receptor called KA1 .
Performing a series of experiments exploring the impact of stress and steroids on rats , they found that stress , simulated by restraining the rats for six hours a day for three weeks , caused the genes to send instructions — messenger RNA — to increase production of KA1 subunits in particular parts of the hippocampus , a highly plastic brain structure involved in learning and memory .
The lab produced a similar result by injecting unstressed rats with hormones called corticosteroids , suggesting that an increase in these hormones is largely responsible for the stress response in rats .
But the researchers also found that the dose is critical .
While a moderate amount of corticosteroids increased KA1 messenger RNA , a high dose of the steroids did not .
The relationship between the hormone and its impact is an inverted U response , a pattern familiar to biologists .
“ The body seeks to maintain ideal levels , whether it is salts in the blood or any number of other things like KA1 , ” Hunter says .
“ Deviations to either side of these levels can cause pathologies or changes .
The body adapts to changing circumstances to keep the levels healthy . ”
Stress and depression are known to cause a reversible retraction of dendrites in certain brain cells , particularly in the hippocampus , that McEwen and colleagues refer to as “ adaptive plasticity . ”
The new research suggests that an increase in KA1 , caused by the corticosteroid response in rats , may trigger this retraction .
The finding follows recent work by Rockefeller ’s Sidney Strickland , head of the Laboratory of Neurobiology and Genetics , that showed that KA1 production explodes in the hippocampus during simulated stroke in mice , driving a cell - death cascade that begins when part of the brain is deprived of blood .
Combined , the work suggests that the relatively understudied KA1 subunit plays an important role in a key area of the brain in both causing damage in an uncontrolled trauma such as a stroke and in protecting the brain from damage under the more controlled circumstances of chronic stress .
McEwen and colleagues have shown that healthy brains are remarkably resilient in the face of stress — brains replace their retracted neurons once the stress is removed .
Perhaps , the researchers say , the same will prove true for depression .
“ One of the great hopes is that these changes in the hippocampus that happen with prolonged depression may not be signs of permanent irreversible damage but they may actually be signs of plasticity that we can treat with appropriate medications and also behavioral therapies , ” McEwen says .

Monday afternoon local time , Czech network operator SuproNet apparently decided that it did n't like the way traffic from the Internet flowed towards its network .
So the company made a change .
The result was that a number of routers elsewhere started disconnecting from and then reconnecting to their neighbors .
This increased the number of routing information updates flowing through routers worldwide from a few thousand per second to 25,000 every second for several hours .
The big routers in ISP networks — and the networks of end -users connected to multiple ISPs — use the Border Gateway Protocol ( BGP ) to tell each other which ranges of IP addresses are used where on the Internet .
As the " border " part suggests , the protocol is run between routers belonging to different organizations , usually with a strong economic interest in what BGP does for them .
As such , the protocol is a huge experiment in cooperative real - time computing on a worldwide scale .
Whenever a new BGP - speaking router joins the existing network , it injects new information which is then copied to all other BGP routers worldwide .
Every range of IP addresses ( " prefix " in BGP parlance ) has a number of " path attributes " attached to it .
An important one of these is the AS path : this is a list of the Autonomous System numbers of the network operators that provide connectivity to the destination in question .
The AS path allows BGP to avoid loops : when the local AS is already present in the AS path for a prefix , a router wo n't accept the prefix to avoid packets from circling around the network .
Another function of the AS path is to convey preference : short AS paths are better than long ones .
So if you 're connected to two ISPs , and you would prefer to move some incoming traffic from one ISP to the other , you could artificially increase the AS path that you present to the ISP that you want to slow down .
Others then see a shorter AS path through the more preferred ISP and will probably decide to send traffic to you through that ISP .
It looks like this is what SuproNet did — a little too enthusiastically : the resulting AS path was more than 255 ASs long .
There is nothing in the BGP protocol that says this is n't allowed , but this triggered one very old Cisco bug , and probably another , newer bug .
The old bug was fixed in 2003 and kicks in whenever a path contains more than 126 AS numbers .
In this case , BGP uses a different length encoding , which older versions of the Cisco IOS software did n't handle correctly .
So the next router would see an invalid BGP packet and close the session .
Shortly after that , the routers involved would reestablish the session , send a whole bunch of updates to other routers , encounter the same problem again and break off the BGP session again ... ad infinitum .
The other bug is less publicized , but apparently this one kicks in at 255 ASs in the AS path .
It seems unlikely that very many routers involved in BGP are still running software more than five years old , but the other bug was fixed much more recently , so a good number of people are still running IOS versions in their routers that are vulnerable .
But it looks like for now these routers are in the clear :

In his book " Internet Routing Architectures " about the BGP protocol , Sam Halabi writes , " Some people are surprised when networks fail .
I 'm surprised when they do n't . "
I 'm with you , Sam .

How full did that meal you just ate make you feel ?
Did it satisfy your hunger or did you feel like you needed to snack later ?
Now a new tool for measuring hunger and helping with blood sugar control is available .
Studies by Australian researcher Dr. Susanne Holt at the University of Sydney have developed one of the most exciting diet concepts ever .
Called the “ Satiety Index ” , it was developed by having students come in the morning and eat 240 - calorie portions of a specific food .
Then they rated their feelings of hunger every 15 minutes , and over the next two hours , students could go to a buffet table and eat as much as the liked , all under the observation of researchers .
Using white bread as the baseline of 100 , they scored 38 different foods that were given to the students .
Foods scoring higher than 100 were judged to be more satisfying than white bread , while those under 100 were less satisfying .
Foods that have a higher satiety index keep hunger down longer and would be better choices for those who want to lose weight .
A fascinating finding of Dr. Holt ’s study is that some foods like croissants are only half as satisfying as white bread , while potatoes are more than three times as satisfying , but French fries did not score well !
As a group , fruits ranked at the top for foods to choose with a satiety index 1.7 times higher than white bread .
The Satiety Index All are compared to white bread , ranked as “ 100 ”
Each food is rated by how well it satisfied their hunger .
Tip :
If you want to lose weight , avoid the LOWER numbers !
Bakery Products Carbohydrate Rich Foods Croissant 47 % White bread 100 % Cake 65 % French fries 116 % Doughnuts 68 % White pasta 119 % Cookies 120 % Brown Rice 132 % Crackers 127 %
White rice 138 % Snacks and Confectionary Grain bread 154 % Mars candy bar 70 % Wholemeal bread 157 % Peanuts 84 % Brown pasta 188 % Yogurt 88 % Potatoes 323 % Crisps 91 % Protein - Rich Foods Ice cream 96 % Lentils 133 % Jellybeans 118 % Cheese 146 % Popcorn 154 % Eggs 150 % Breakfast Cereals Baked beans 168 % Muesli 100 % Beef 176 % Sustain 112 % Fish 225 % Special K 116 % Fruits Cornflakes 118 % Bananas 118 % Honeysmacks 132 % Grapes 162 % All - Bran 151 % Apples 197 % Porridge / Oatmeal 209 % Oranges 202 %
Using this study , the May 1996 issue of the “ University of California - Berkeley Wellness Letter , ” gave suggestions for weight - watchers trying to get the most satisfaction from the fewest calories :
Potatoes gave the highest satisfaction , seven times higher than the least - filling croissants .
Whole - grain breads are 50 % more filling than white breads .
Cakes , donuts , and cookies are among the least filling .
For fruits , oranges and apples outscore bananas .
Fish is more satisfying , per calorie , than lean beef or chicken .
Popcorn is twice as filling as a candy bar or peanuts .
Holt ’s Food Satiety Index
Holt ’s Food Satiety
Index is the first of its kind demonstrating that foods with high - fat content create almost instant cravings for more of the same .
Croissants , for instance , had the lowest score of all the foods tested , even though most people think of them as filling .
Chips gave almost twice as much satisfaction as doughnuts , and popcorn scored higher than All - Bran .
The very best thing to eat is potatoes , which gave much more satisfaction than the same number of calories in the form of white bread .
“ Fatty foods are not satisfying , even though people expected them to be ” , says Dr. Holt .
‘ We think the reason is that fat is seen by the body as a fuel which should be used only in emergencies – it stores it in the cells instead of breaking it down for immediate use .
Because it does n’t recognize the fat as energy for immediate use , the body does not tell the brain to cut hunger signals , so we go on wanting more .
Carbohydrates are the opposite – they raise blood glucose so the body knows it has got enough fuel to be going on with . ’
Overall , the carbohydrates deter nibbling best , while protein - rich foods such as cheese , eggs , baked beans , meat , and fish come second , and fruit third .
But there are big differences between the satisfaction value of foods within the same group .
“ You ca n’t just say that vegetables are satisfying or those bakery products are n’t , because there can be a two - fold difference between two similar foods , ” says Dr. Holt .
“ We found that bananas are much less satisfying than oranges or apples and that wholemeal bread is half as satisfying again as white bread .
And a diet which simply recommends cereal for breakfast overlooks the fact that muesli is only half as satisfying as porridge . ”
“ One thing that I am concerned about , is that many people do not know how to interpret these findings properly .
The SI scores reflect the total amount of fullness produced by the set 1000 kJ portions of the test foods over 2 hours – ie short - term satiety .
Although most foods with high SI scores kept fullness relatively high for the whole 2 hours , there were a few exceptions .
The fruits were served in very large portions , but fullness dropped off quickly towards the end of the 2nd hour , reflecting the rapid rate of gastric emptying ( oranges and apples and grapes are mainly sugar and water ) . ”
“ Many “ health - conscious ” dieters will eat a meal based on several pieces of fruit and some rice cakes ( in Australia anyway ) and then wonder why they feel ravenous a few hours later .
These kinds of extremely low - fat , high - carb meals do not keep hunger at bay because they are not based on slowly - digested carbs and probably do n’t contain enough protein .
A dieter would be better off eating a wholesome salad sandwich on wholegrain bread with some lean protein like tuna , or beef , and an apple .
This kind of meal can keep hunger at bay for a very long time . ”
One thing that makes a portion of food satisfying is its sheer bulk .
‘ You can eat an awful lot of popcorn without taking in a lot of calories , ’ says Dr. Holt .
‘ It may not weigh much , but it makes your stomach feel full just because it takes up so much space .
Oranges come out very high on the index for the same reason – but orange juice probably would n’t , even though it has the same number of calories . ’
Chemical constituents of foods also make a difference .
‘ Beans and lentils , for example , contain anti-nutrients which delay their absorption so they make you feel full for longer , ’ says Dr. Holt .
‘ Roughly speaking , the more fiber , protein , and water a food contains , the longer it will satisfy .
but you have to look at each foodstuff individually – and that is why we think our index will be so useful . ’
Study Design Dr. Susanne
Holt drew up the Satiety Index by feeding 38 different foods to volunteers in portions that provided exactly 1,000 kilojoules ( about 240 calories ) of energy .
The foods were served from under a perspex hood to minimize the influence of appearance , and , if possible , they were served at the same temperature and in the same size chunks .
After eating them the volunteers were left for two hours to nibble as they liked from other foods .
Their consumption was closely monitored and every 15 minutes they were questioned about their hunger to see if their subjective impression of satisfaction matched their eating behavior .
Each food was rated according to how much other food was eaten later .
White bread was taken as the bench - mark and given a value of 100 .
Foods that staved off hunger pangs for longer were given scores above 100 and those which gave less satisfaction rated below 100 .
The lead scientist and principal author of the satiety index studies is Dr. Susanne Holt .
She is now a research scientist working with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) , Australia ’s largest scientific research agency .

In general , the more satisfying a food felt , the more effective it proved as a nibbling deterrent .
But even here there were surprises .
Volunteers fed jellybeans did not feel satisfied , yet they ate very little afterward .
This resulted in the sweets getting a satiety rating of 118 – higher than muesli and yogurt , and almost the same as white pasta .
“ I suspect the reason that the jellybeans came out so well was that they made our volunteers feel slightly nauseous , ’ said Dr. Holt .
‘ We ’ll be doing some research on that one – if we can persuade people to act as volunteers ! ”
Of all the food tests , boiled potatoes are easily the most satisfying .
Since beans and lentils are slowly absorbed , they are among those foods that many you feel fuller longer .
Other factors may also be operative .
Doug Skrecky thinks that one of these could be viscosity :
“ I am currently analyzing the results of this index with respect to known determinants of satiety , ” he writes me .
“ Preliminary findings indicate that in their explanations for the various SI ratings the authors have ignored at least one important factor which accounts for many of the otherwise unexplainable results : Viscosity effects .
Dry foods , such as cookies are more satiating than moist foods like donuts .
Foods with high moisture binding capabilities such as cheese , porridge , and potatoes can also increase the viscosity of stomach contents . ”
A recent message from Dr. Holt gave this advance information :
“ I ’ll let you know about any additional results we get .
We ’ve just done a short study comparing the satisfying power of different breakfasts .
Two high - fat breakfasts of fried eggs and bacon and toast or croissants and jam were much less filling than two equal - calorie high - carb breakfasts which were either rapidly - digested ( cornflakes with sugar and toast and jam ) or slowly - digested ( All - Bran with banana slices , toast , and marg ) . ”
“ I am also interested in how foods affect mood and alertness .
The two high - carb breakfasts tended to improve alertness to a greater extent than the two high - fat breakfasts .
Also , because the subjects were not completely satisfied with the two high - fat meals , they tended to be grumpy and a bit more aggressive / disappointed .
“ I will be doing a satiety study with children soon . ”

The Satiety Index Elsewhere on the Internet :
“ Diet Tips – The Satiety Index , ” reports on studies by researchers at the University of Sydney in Australia for National Bodybuilding & Fitness zine .
The article says in part , “ Food weight appears to be the determining factor .
A portion of food that weighs more than another portion of the food of equal caloric value is more satisfying .
For example , boiled potatoes rated very high on the index , foods like hard candy ( high sugar foods ) , or candy bars rated very low .
Extremely high - fat foods like cheesecake also rated badly , however some foods with moderate amounts of fat , such as lean steak , rate fairly well …
A quick way to determine whether a food would have a high satiety index or not is to look it up in your calorie book and compare the calories to the portion size .
If a 4 - ounce portion of food ( about 120 g. ) , has over 250 calories – avoid it . ”
The Toronto Vegetarian Association says , “ According to their investigation , the most satisfying foods were high in fiber .
These included such items as whole grain products , potatoes , and fruits .
Foods high in fat were the least filling .
Ironically , the tastiest foods – those high in sugar and fat , like sweet bakery products – were the least satiating .
That ’s because volunteers reached their caloric limit for these foods before they ’d eaten enough to feel satisfied .
In real life , there may not be a scientist looking over our shoulder to prevent us from going overboard on calories , so the tendency is to eat until satisfied , and pay the price in being overweight . ”

An original report about the satiety index is “ Carbohydrates in Human Nutrition ; Interim Report of a Joint FAO / WHO Expert Consultation , Rome , Italy , 14 to 18 April 1997 . ”
It says in part : “ Two indices of carbohydrate foods based on their physiologic functions have been proposed .
A recently suggested satiety index [ citing reference 53 , which is Holt , S.H.A. , J.C. Brand - Miller and P. Petocz .

Interrelationships among postprandial satiety , glucose and insulin responses , and changes in subsequent food intake .
Eur. J. Clin. Nutr.,50:788-797 ] measures the satiety value of equal energy portions of foods relative to a standard , which is white bread .
The factors which control food intake are complex and satiety needs to be distinguished from satiation .
Nevertheless , investigation of satiety indices of foods is considered an interesting area of future research , which , if validated , may aid in the selection of appropriate carbohydrate foods to promote energy balance .
A more established index is the glycemic index which can be used to classify foods based on their blood glucose - raising potential . ”

On September 19th , CERN announced that the Large Hadron Collider had suffered a major incident , known as a “ quench ” .
An electrical short between two of the superconducting magnets had kick - started a helium coolant leak inside the tunnels housing the accelerator ring .
The quench caused the magnets to rapidly heat up , severely damaging them .
The violent release of coolant ripped equipment from their concrete anchors , ensuring a huge repair operation would need to be carried out .
However , it was a while before engineers were able to access the damage and the news was n’t good :
The LHC would be out of commission until the spring of 2009 at the earliest .
That was such a sad day .
Late last month , CERN Director - General Robert Aymar gave a presentation to the 84th Plenary Meeting of the European Committee for Future Accelerators , showing the first public images of the quench aftermath , an accident that has become known as the “ S34 Incident ” .
In addition to these images , there are suggestions that there may be no particle collisions next year .
Although the most recent report does n’t appear to back up these plans , and replacement parts have started to arrive at the facility ( above ) , it looks like the first collisions probably wo n’t happen until July 2009 at the earliest ( that ’s four months later than previously estimated ) …
It looks like the September 19th quench between Sectors 3 - 4 of the LHC ring is now being referred to as the “ S34 Incident “ .
And what an incident it was .
Fortunately nobody was injured during the quench , but the LHC was n’t so lucky .
For a rundown of the official account of the S34 Incident , I ’ll hand over to Robert Aymar ’s November 28th presentation ( page 15 ) :
Within the first second , an electrical arc developed and punctured the helium enclosure , leading to release of helium into the insulation vacuum of the cryostat .
The spring - loaded relief discs on the vacuum enclosure opened when the pressure exceeded atmospheric , thus relieving the helium to the tunnel .
They were however unable to contain the pressure rise below the nominal 0.15 MPa absolute in the vacuum enclosures of subsector 23 - 25 , thus resulting in large pressure forces acting on the vacuum barriers separating neighboring subsectors , which most probably damaged them .
These forces displaced dipoles in the subsectors affected from their cold internal supports , and knocked the Short Straight Section cryostats housing the quadrupoles and vacuum barriers from their external support jacks at positions Q23 , Q27 and Q31 , in some locations breaking their anchors in the concrete floor of the tunnel .
The displacement of the Short Straight Section cryostats also damaged the “ jumper ” connections to the cryogenic distribution line , but without rupture of the transverse vacuum barriers equipping these jumper connections , so that the insulation vacuum in the cryogenic line not degrade .
– Robert Aymar , Status of CERN Activities , page 15 .
The first image ( pictured above ) clearly shows the extent of the concrete damage that occurred during the huge pressure forces generated by the leaking helium , ripping the electromagnets off their supports ( the red boxes in the photo ) and shattering the floor .
In this second image , the extent of the damage is pretty clear .
Assuming the accelerator beam - line used to be straight ( unfortunately , there is no “ before ” picture ) , the violent displacement of a huge magnet ( weighing several tonnes ) is obvious .
Later in the presentation , Aymar points out that 5 quadrupole and 24 dipole magnets need to be repaired and around 57 magnets have to be removed to be cleaned .
This will be a huge task , one that will last many months .
According to one eagle - eyed blogger at High Energy PhDs , a previous report presented a few days before the Aymar report signalled that there may be no high energy particle collisions until 2010 .
Jorg Winnenger outlined two possibilities for the LHC : 1 ) Partial operations in 2009 , allowing only low - energy particle acceleration to await full - scale repairs through the 2009 - 10 winter shutdown , or 2 ) Forget 2009 operations and work toward full - scale experiments in 2010 .
Aymar ’s more recent report did not mention these scenarios , simply stating , “ the LHC will restart operation in the next spring . ”
This might be a little optimistic , as other quarters are signalling a July 2009 “ cool - down ” before operations can begin .
Judging by the mixed signals , we ’ll have to wait patiently until it is clear as to when the LHC is expected to recover .
Either way , it will be a long , painstaking and expensive task that needs to be completed as soon as possible .
I really hope we do n’t have to wait until 2010 until restart .
Good luck to all involved in the LHC repairs .

All in all , the text of Article II , while somewhat ambiguous — a flaw that would be quickly exploited — provided little warning that the office of president would become uniquely powerful .
Even at the convention , Madison mused that it “ would rarely if ever happen that the executive constituted as ours is proposed to be would have firmness enough to resist the legislature . ”
In fact , when citizens considered the draft Constitution during the ratification debates in 1787 and 1788 , many of their concerns centered on the possibility that the Senate would make the president its cat ’s - paw .
Few people foresaw the modern presidency , largely because the office as we know it today bears so little relation to that prescribed by the Constitution .
The modern presidency is primarily the intellectual handiwork not of “ the Framers ” but of one Framer — Alexander Hamilton .
Hamilton ’s idea of the presidency can be found in a remarkable speech he gave to the convention , on June 18 , 1787 .
In it , Hamilton argued that the president should serve for life , name Cabinet members without Senate approval , have an absolute veto on legislation , and have “ the direction of war ” once “ authorized or begun . ”
The president would be a monarch , Hamilton admitted , but an “ elective monarch . ”
Hamilton ’s plan was so far from the mainstream of thought at the convention that none of its provisions was ever seriously discussed .
Nonetheless , Hamilton was and remains the chief theorist of the presidency , first in writing his essays for The Federalist and then in serving as George Washington ’s secretary of the Treasury .
In this latter role , acting as Washington ’s de facto prime minister , Hamilton took full advantage of the vagueness and brevity of Article II , laying the groundwork for an outsize presidency while the war - hero Washington was still in office .
In The Federalist , Hamilton had famously proclaimed that “ energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government . ”
Just how much energy he favored became clear during America ’s first foreign crisis , the Neutrality Proclamation controversy of 1793 .
When Britain and France went to war , many Americans wanted to aid their Revolutionary ally .
But Washington and the Federalists were rightly terrified of war with the powerful British Empire .
Washington unilaterally proclaimed that the United States would be neutral .
France ’s American supporters , covertly aided by Thomas Jefferson , fiercely attacked Washington for exceeding his constitutional authority .
The power to make treaties , they said , was jointly lodged in the president and the Senate ; how could Washington unilaterally interpret or change the terms of the treaty of alliance with France ?
Under the pen name “ Pacificus , ” Hamilton wrote a defense of Washington ’s power to act without congressional sanction .
The first Pacificus essay is the mother document of the “ unitary executive ” theory that Bush ’s apologists have pushed to its limits since 2001 .
Hamilton seized on the first words of Article II : “ The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . ”
He contrasted this wording with Article I , which governs Congress and which begins , “ All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States . ”
What this meant , Hamilton argued , was that Article II was “ a general grant of … power ” to the president .
Although Congress was limited to its enumerated powers , the executive could do literally anything that the Constitution did not expressly forbid .
Hamilton ’s president existed , in effect , outside the Constitution .
LAS VEGAS ( Reuters ) - More than a decade after O.J. Simpson stunned much of America by walking away from a murder trial a free man , the onetime football great known for unbridled speed was preparing to spend in prison what should have been the prime years of a superstar ’s retirement .
O.J. Simpson appears in court as his sentence is read at the Clark County Regional Justice Center in Las Vegas , Nevada , December 5 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Ethan Miller / POOL
The 61 - year - old former athlete , Hollywood actor and pioneering symbol of African - American celebrity success was sentenced on Friday to as much as 33 years behind bars , with eligibility for parole after nine , for a robbery caper in Las Vegas last year .
As the retired football hero once known as “ The Juice ” was led away in shackles , many who have followed his downward spiral over the years still wondered how a figure who inspired a generation could have fallen so far from grace .
Even Simpson ’s former sister - in - law , Denise Brown , who believes he was guilty of murdering her sister , lamented his fate .
“ It is very sad to think that an individual who had it all , an amazing career , beautiful wife and two precious children has ended up like this , ” Denise Brown said in a statement following the sentencing .
The case stemmed from a bid by Simpson to reclaim what he insisted were personal possessions that had been stolen from him .
With five other men in tow , he stormed into a small room at the Palace Station hotel and casino in September 2007 and made off with thousands of dollars in collectibles they seized at gunpoint from a pair of memorabilia dealers there .
In the words of Simpson himself , pleading for leniency in a hoarse , trembling voice as he stood before the judge in blue jail garb : “ In no way did I mean to hurt anybody , to steal anything . ”
But Clark County District Court Judge Jackie Glass rejected defense arguments that Simpson acted without criminal intent and she suggested that he was his own worst enemy .
“ While at this case bail hearing , I said to Mr. Simpson that I did n’t know if he was arrogant or ignorant or both .
Then during the trial and through this proceeding , I got the answer : it was both . ”

‘A LITTLE RELIEVED ’
It was a stinging , final rebuke for a man whose has lived largely as a public pariah , years after his towering athletic achievements led to television and film acting , including rental car ads in which he dashed through a crowded airport in a business suit , ever the football running back .
Blazing a trail later followed by the likes of basketball greats Michael Jordan and Ervin “ Magic ” Johnson , Simpson was one of the first black athletes to parlay his sports success into a career as a major celebrity pitchman and pop culture superstar .
His sentencing came two months after a Las Vegas jury concluded a three - week trial by finding Simpson and co-defendant Clarence “ C.J. ”
Stewart guilty of all 12 charges against them , including kidnapping , assault , robbery and assault with a deadly weapon .
Simpson ’s conviction came 13 years to the day that he was acquitted in Los Angeles of the murder of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ron Goldman , who were stabbed and slashed to death in June 1994 .
A civil court jury later found Simpson liable for the deaths and awarded $ 33.5 million in damages to the victims ’ families , a judgment that remains largely unpaid .
Both prosecutors and defense lawyers said the case was inextricably linked with his previous legal woes .
Prosecutors contended the robbery grew out of grudges Simpson had nursed since his murder trial and civil case .
Simpson ’s lead attorney , Yale Galanter , has said his client ’s past as a notorious murder defendant , widely seen as having eluded justice in Los Angeles , was a factor in Las Vegas jurors ’ guilty verdict .
But even as his client faces years in prison , Galanter said that Simpson might have lucked out once again .
“ I think he is a little relieved that he did n’t get a life sentence , ” Galanter said , adding , “ We were preparing Mr. Simpson for the worst . ”
House Dems detail recovery plan
House Democrats released new details about their economic recovery plan late Friday , showing substantially smaller business tax breaks than Barack Obama proposed and a greater emphasis on credits to spur renewable energy production and help state and local governments float bonds in today ’s difficult financial market .
A breakdown provided by the House Ways and Means Committee shows that the total Democratic tax package will cost about $ 275.5 billion over 10 years , of which about $ 189.2 billion is attributed to tax breaks for individuals .
Advertisement
Tax staff estimate that business would benefit from an estimated $ 36.5 billion in tax breaks , including some of the incentives for energy production .
But the big — and less well - defined — new player is about $ 49.5 billion that will most benefit state and local governments .
These 10 - year estimates , to some degree , understate the immediate benefits for companies since new depreciation and expensing provisions will be more valuable to them in the short term .
But the Obama tax package — worth about $ 300 billion — boasted that it would devote $ 100 billion , or a third of its tax breaks , to business .
And the president - elect ’s aides were careful to leak details in advance to financial newspapers in hopes of attracting Republican support .
The Democrats ’ desire to do more for state and local governments reflects a larger theme in the development of the entire House economic recovery plan , which is expected to cost in the range of $ 825 billion in total .
Nearly 60 % , or more than $ 300 billion , of the new spending over the next two years , for example , would be channeled to state and local governments , chiefly through education and health care programs .
When it comes to tax breaks for individuals , the House plan is more faithful to the Obama proposals , and $ 145.3 billion is dedicated to his signature “ Making Work Pay ” tax credit , worth up to $ 500 for individuals –and $ 1000 for working families — to help defray the burden of payroll taxes .
The plan would temporarily increase the earned - income tax credit for families with three or more children at a cost of $ 4.66 billion .
But the far bigger change is a major increase in the eligibility for the refundable child tax credit that will cost $ 18.27 billion .
The chief business tax breaks focus on bonus depreciation and enhanced small business expensing , worth about $ 5.1 billion .
And at a cost of $ 17.18 billion , Obama would get his expanded “ carryback ” provision allowing a company to reach back further to claim net operating losses .
But the House bill would bar major banks and investment houses , which have benefited from recent Treasury bailout funds , from taking advantage of this Obama tax break , which effectively allows a carryback period of five years , compared with two years today .
Among the state and local provisions , the most expensive involve the use of tax credit bonds .
At a cost of almost $ 9 billion , the bill creates a new category of tax credit bonds for the construction and repair of school facilities .
At the same time a second provision promises a new option to make such bonds more attractive by offering a direct federal payment as a subsidy .
Tax credit bonds are a debt instrument that allows their purchasers to receive a nonrefundable credit against their federal income tax liability instead of the cash interest that is typically paid on the borrowing that bonds represent .
With tax - credit bonds , the federal government bears virtually all of the cost of borrowing — in the form of forgone revenues — even if the bonds are issued by a nonfederal entity such as a state or city .
But in today ’s economy , the market for such tax credits is less , and the new bill would instead give states and cities the option of receiving a direct payment from Washington equivalent to the subsidy that would otherwise come from the tax credit .
Like most all of the tax provisions , this also is temporary , applying to just bonds issued in 2009 and 2010 .
But the 10 - year - cost is as much as $ 18.27 billion .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 6 ( UPI ) --
Some schools in the United States have stopped handing out failing grades , or at least are delaying them while students get a chance to improve .
In Grand Rapids , Mich. , work that would justify an " F " will get an " H " for " held , " ABC News reported .
The school superintendent , Bernard Taylor , said students will have several choices -- including retaking a course , doing additional work or agreeing on another plan with teachers -- but the grade will become a failing one if nothing is done within 12 weeks .

" I never see anyone doing anything but punishing kids , " Taylor said .
" If the choice is between letting kids fail and giving them another opportunity to succeed , I 'm going to err on the side of opportunity . "
Taylor and many other teachers and administrators say they believe many children quickly become discouraged and failing them contributes to the country 's high dropout rate .
He argues that children need to see a way forward .
Critics say the practice is amounts to coddling children .
" The task is to change the reality , not the labeling of it , " said Alan Kazdin , a child psychiatrist at Yale .
Do n't even bother with that BRABUS overhaul , as you can now get a Roadster with 15 percent more peak power and a 0 to 60 time of 3.7 seconds right from the factory .
Out of seemingly nowhere , Tesla Motors has just announced the lovingly refined Roadster Sport , which arrives with a hand - wound stator and increased winding density for lower resistance and higher peak torque .
You 'll also notice Yokohama Ultra High Performance tires , improved suspension with adjustable dampers and anti-roll bars that will be tuned to the driver 's preference .
The automaker is taking orders now in the US ( $ 128,500 and up ) and Europe ( starts at € 112,000 ) , with deliveries slated to begin in late June -- oh , and if you 're currently on the waiting list for a standard Roadster , you most certainly can scratch the upgrade itch .

Wikipedia over DNS
I had written some code to take wikipedia articles and summarise them .
I wanted to offer this for use in various places , now the obvious way to offer it is just a web service ( via REST , XMLRPC , etc ) , but that 's boring and I had a cunning plan .
Why not offer it over DNS - it is basically a huge associative array and DNS is designed for this stuff .
So I wrote a little nameserver which returns the results as TXT records .
There are some obvious limitations for example responses are limited to around 430 bytes ( it only does UDP and no EDNS ) .
It has advantages too , it gets cached at your nameserver and it also has slightly lower latency than HTTP ( because there 's no need to setup a TCP session ) .
Here 's an example :
$ host -t txt foo.wp.dg.cx
foo.wp.dg.cx descriptive text " Foo may refer to : Foo , bar , and baz : metasyntactic variables , \ " Fool\ " , as a nonstandard spelling to indicate a nonstandard pronunciation , Foo Fighters , a post - grunge group formed by Dave Grohl , Foo fighters , a World War II term for various UFOs or mysterio\ " \" us aerial phenomena seen in the skies over Europe and the Pacific theatre , Foo , also a known surname or last name of a ...
http://a.vu/w:Foo "
Using it from Perl is fairly easy too , with a little help from Net:: DNS :
use Net:: DNS ; my $res = Net :: DNS :: Resolver -> new ; sub wikipedia { my ( $ name ) = @_ ; my $q = $ res->query ( " $name.wp.dg.cx " , " TXT " ) ; if ( $q ) { for my $ rr ( $ q -> answer ) { next unless $ rr -> type eq " TXT " ; return join " " , $ rr -> char_str_list ; } } } print wikipedia ( $ ARGV [ 0 ] ) ;
Unicode should be supported , all DNS queries are expected to be in UTF - 8 ( this assumes your resolver is happy with 8 bit characters , some are n't --- I might support IDN one day ) .
See the example below ( the perl is just there to unescape the escaping dig does ) .
The result is returned in UTF - 8 , which everything can handle .
For example :
$ dig + short txt ' 新疆.wp.dg.cx ' | perl - pe's / \\( \d { 1,3} ) / chr $ 1/eg '

Single drive wipe protects data , research finds
A computer forensics specialist has a message for security - minded computer users : A single wipe will make drives impossible to read .
In research published on Thursday , auditor Craig Wright tested the ability of a special type of electron microscope , known as a magnetic force microscope , to read data that has been erased .
While overwriting the data multiple times with a random series of 0s and 1s makes it harder to recover , Wright found that it is nearly impossible to recover any meaningful amount of data after a only single pass .
Recovering a single byte of data , for example , on a used drive is successful less than one percent of the time , he found .
Accurately recovering four bytes , or 32 bits , of data only works nine times out of each million tries .
( Editor 's note : SecurityFocus is currently investigating the veracity of the research paper mentioned in this article .
Peter Gutmann of the University of Auckland , an expert on secure deletion , has criticized the work in the epilogue to his paper on secure deletion . )
" Although there is a good chance of recovery for any individual bit from a drive , the chances of recovery of any amount of data from a drive using an electron microscope are negligible , " Wright stated .
" The fallacy that data can be forensically recovered using an electron microscope or related means needs to be put to rest . "
Many software products designed to wipe hard drive allow for multiple passes to erase the data .
Common wisdom holds that the more sensitive the data , the more times you should overwrite the drive .
However , Wright 's research suggests that a single pass is all that 's necessary to protect the data on a hard drive .
Wright did find that multiple passes do make it harder to recover data and that data written to a pristine drive is much easier to recover .
Yet , in the most common case , where the drive has been used and written to multiple times , a user can be assured of their privacy by a single pass .
" In many instances , using a MFM ( magnetic force microscope ) to determine the prior value written to the hard drive was less successful than a simple coin toss . "
UPDATE : The article was updated on Monday to add a link to the original research and highlight criticism of the paper .

Great bright hope to end battle of the light bulbs
A lighting revolution is on the way that could end at the flick of a switch the battle between supporters of conventional bulbs and the eco-friendly variety .
Cambridge University researchers have developed cheap , light - emitting diode ( LED ) bulbs that produce brilliant light but use very little electricity .
They will cost £ 2 and last up to 60 years .
Despite being smaller than a penny , they are 12 times more efficient than conventional tungsten bulbs and three times more efficient than the unpopular fluorescent low - energy versions .
Cambridge University professor Colin Humphreys with his newly developed LED that has a lifespan of 60 years and costs just £ 2
Even better , the bulbs fully illuminate instantly , unlike the current generation of eco-bulbs .
It is reckoned the bulbs , which were funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council , could slash household lighting bills by three - quarters .
If installed in every home and office , they could cut the proportion of electricity used for lights from 20 per cent to 5 per cent a year .
As well as lasting 100,000 hours , ten times as long as today 's eco-bulbs , the LED bulbs do not contain mercury , so disposal is less damaging to the environment , and they do not flicker - a problem that has been blamed for migraines and epileptic fits .
Professor Humphreys says the LED bulbs developed at the centre are three times more efficient than the unpopular fluorescent low - energy bulbs
The Daily Mail revealed earlier this month that in the switchover to eco-bulbs , shops had stopped replenishing stocks of the traditional 100 - watt incandescent version .
The move prompted panic buying among consumers .
Whitehall claims the switch will reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by five million tons a year - the amount produced by a typical one gigawatt power station .
The new bulbs could cut emissions by eight times that amount .
They use gallium nitride , a man -made semiconductor used to make light - emitting diodes .
LEDs are already in use in bicycle lights , mobile phones , camera flashes and Christmas lights because they are relatively cheap due to their size and brightness compared to normal bulbs .
But until now the production costs have been too expensive for widespread use because the material had to be ' grown ' on sapphire wafers , meaning a single household bulb would have cost £ 20 .
Scientists at the Cambridge University - based Centre for Gallium Nitride solved that problem by growing it on silicon wafers .
A manufacturer , RFMD in County Durham , has begun work on production prototypes and the first bulbs could be in the shops within two years .
The head of the centre , Professor Colin Humphreys , said : ' This could well be the holy grail in terms of providing our lighting needs for the future .
' We are very close to achieving highly efficient , low - cost white LEDs .
' That wo n't just be good news for the environment .
It will also benefit consumers by cutting their electricity bills .
' It is our belief they will render current energy - efficiency bulbs redundant . '
Climate Change Paradox Wind Turbines in Europe Do Nothing for Emissions - Reduction Goals
Despite Europe 's boom in solar and wind energy , CO2 emissions have n't been reduced by even a single gram .
Now , even the Green Party is taking a new look at the issue -- as shown in e-mails obtained by SPIEGEL ONLINE .
WASHINGTON 
The financial giant Bank of America says it is no longer lobbying the federal government about its unfolding bank bailout .
After receiving $ 45 billion in bailout money , lobbying was just too unseemly .
“ We are very sensitive to the fact that we have taxpayer money , ” said Shirley Norton , a spokeswoman for the company .
Citigroup , recipient of another $ 45 billion , made the opposite call .
While trying to keep a low profile , the company is still fielding an army of Washington lobbyists working on a host of issues , including the bailout .
In the fourth quarter , it spent $ 1.77 million on lobbying fees , according to its lobbyists ’ filings .
The different approaches from the two banks that have received the most money underscores the growing dilemma facing private companies , which increasingly deal with the federal government not only as rule - maker but also as shareholder , lender and trading partner .

Here ’s one thing that bears mentioning now that it appears Leon Panetta is President - elect Barack Obama ’s to head the CIA .
Given the worries about whether John Brennan might have been too soft on torture — put aside the merits of that contention for a moment — no one can have that fear about Panetta .
Here ’s something he wrote about torture for the Washington Monthly last year :
We cannot simply suspend [ American ideals of human rights ] in the name of national security .
Those who support torture may believe that we can abuse captives in certain select circumstances and still be true to our values .
But that is a false compromise .
We either believe in the dignity of the individual , the rule of law , and the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment , or we do n’t .
There is no middle ground .
We cannot and we must not use torture under any circumstances .
We are better than that .
True , every member of the Bush administration has said that they disapprove of torture while torturing people .
So we ’ll have to wait for Panetta ’s confirmation hearings to know specifically what he thinks of , say , waterboarding or rendition .
But as a statement of principle , that seems pretty reflective of a strong commitment to human rights and civil liberties .

CHICAGO , Dec. 1 ( UPI ) --
Use of light exposure therapy , dark sunglasses and a strict sleep schedule can help night - shift workers increase alertness , U.S. researchers said .
Subjects underwent a total of seven simulated night shifts from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. with two days off .
Experimental subjects slept in dark bedrooms at scheduled times : 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. after the first two night shifts , from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. after the third night shifts , from 3 a.m. to 12 p.m. on the two weekend days off , and again from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. after the final four night shifts

When the phase delays of the experimental group had likely reached the compromise circadian position , performance for this group was close to the level during day shifts , demonstrating fast reaction times with low variability and few or no lapses .
In contrast , the control group continued to show longer and more variable reaction times on all night shifts .
Lead author Mark Smith of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago said this created " compromise circadian phase position , " may result in increased performance and alertness during night shifts while still allowing adequate nighttime sleep on days off .
The findings , published in the journal Sleep , show that performance was better for the experimental subjects than the controls .
A new study details how spammers – the bane of our email inboxes – still make pots of money , despite only receiving a response to one in every 12,500,000 emails they spam out .
The study , by a team of seven computer scientists from University of California , Berkeley and UC , San Diego ( UCSD ) infiltrated the Storm network , which uses hijacked home PCs to relay much of the junk email you spend your days wading through while wondering ' who the hell responds to this stuff ? '
Well .
Now you know .
One gullible idiot in 12,500,000 recipients .
Or thereabouts .
Spam the spammers
" The best way to measure spam is to be a spammer , " claims the study .
And they certainly picked the right network to hijack , with the Storm network having over one million machines under its control at one point .
Using ' proxy bots ' the team of researchers managed to control 75,869 hijacked machines to conduct their own fake spam campaigns .
The researchers used two of the most popular ploys currently used by spammers – firstly offering a fake pharmacy site and , secondly , offering a herbal Viagra - style remedy to boost libido .
" After 26 days , and almost 350 million email messages , only 28 sales resulted , " says the research paper .
Yet even with this apparently abysmal response rate of less than 0.00001 per cent , the researchers still estimate that the controllers of a network the size of Storm are still bringing in about $ 7,000 ( £ 4,430 ) a day or $ 3.5 m ( £ 2.21 m ) over a year .
Both baffling and incredibly annoying , we 're sure you will agree .
For some actual useful and helpful information head over to TechRadar 's recent 50 websites you will wonder how you lived without feature .

Why not say that all bank compensation above a baseline amount – say , $ 150,000 in annual salary – has to be paid in toxic assets off the bank ’s balance sheet ?
Instead of getting a check for $ 10,000 , the employee would get $ 10,000 in toxic assets , at their current book value .
A federal regulator can decide which assets to pay compensation in ; if they were all fairly valued , then it would n’t matter which ones the regulator chose .
That would get the assets off the bank ’s balance sheet , and into the hands of the people responsible for putting them there – at the value that they insist they are worth .
Of course , the average employee does not get to set the balance sheet value of the assets , and may not have been involved in creating or buying those particular assets .
But think about the incentives : talented people will flow to the companies that are valuing their assets the most realistically ( since inflated valuations translate directly into lower compensation ) , which will give companies the incentive to be realistic in their valuations .
( Banks could inflate their nominal compensation amounts to compensate for their overvalued assets , but then they would have to take larger losses on their income statements . )
We can dream , ca n’t we ?

HELSINKI ( AFP ) – Police in Finland believe they have caught a car - thief thanks to a DNA sample taken from a sample of his blood found inside a mosquito .
Last June a car was stolen in Lapua , some 380 kilometres ( 235 miles ) north of Helsinki .
It was soon found near a railway station in Seinaejoki , about 25 kilometres from where it was stolen .
" A police patrol carried out an inspection of the car and they noticed a mosquito that had sucked blood .
It was sent to the laboratory for testing , which showed the blood belonged to a man who was in the police registers , " inspector Sakari Palomaeki told AFP .
The suspect , who has been interrogated , has insisted he did not steal the car , saying he had hitchhiked and was given a lift by a man driving the car .
Palomaeki said a prosecutor would decide if the evidence was solid enough for charges to be pressed .
Finnish police said it was rare for them to use insects to solve crimes , although they are interested in everything found at a crime scene .
" It is not usual to use mosquitoes .
In training we were not told to keep an eye on mosquitoes at crime scenes , " Palomaeki said , laughing .
" It is not easy to find a small mosquito in a car , this just shows how thorough the crime scene investigation was , " he added .

Emmanuel Florac and the rest of his officemates had a bit of a problem : while they could freely leave the office as they pleased , none of them could get back in .
Undoubtedly , it had something to do with the new ironclad door and accompanying electronic locking mechanism that was recently installed .
Try as they might , no one ’s keycard would open the door .
Throughout the day , the office manager could not get a hold of the locksmith .
Call after call after call ended with a simple , “ we ’re sorry , this voicemail box is full ; please try your call again later ! ”
As afternoon grew shorter and the evening approached , the jokingly - proposed “ someone ’s going to have to sleep at the office tonight ” became more and more a reality .
Fortunately , Emmanuel had a better idea .
All it took to open the door from the inside was a light tap on the switch , so all he ’d need to do is find something that could lightly touch the door switch .
Unable to find any robot - building components in the office , he sprung for the best alternative : a few cardboard boxes and an unused office PC .
This is what he came up with :
The following morning at 8:00 AM , one of his coworkers called him up to open the door .
Emmanuel put down his cup of coffee , went upstairs to his computer , and then
1 ) VPN to the office
2 ) SSH to the machine in the hall
3 ) Ran ~# eject / dev/scd0
And , click , the door was opened .
The locksmith did end up fixing the door later that day , putting the door - opening robot out of service just as quickly as it came in .
Canada continues to export asbestos to developing countries , despite limiting its use in Canada , write Dr. Amir Attaran , David Boyd and Dr. Matthew Stanbrook in the Canadian Medical Association Journal .
And it 's both hypocritical and dangerous to importing countries , they write .
Canada is opposed to placing chrysotile , the main asbestos fiber used today , under the Rotterdam Convention 's notification and consent process , despite chrysotile being deemed a human carcinogen by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
There is some disagreement about the impact of asbestos .
The 100,000 annual deaths attributed to asbestos are in dispute because those figures were extrapolated worldwide from an area in Europe and critics say the risk from chrysotile is much lower than for other types of asbestos .
Asbestos fibers , like any natural or man-made fibrous breathable materials , can be inhaled but most fibers are expelled .
Some can become lodged in the lungs and remain , causing severe scarring and inflammation and increasing the risk of lung cancer .
Canada argues that “ chrysotile is a less potent carcinogen … and consequently poses a lower health risk . ”
Which is either favoring science instead of public health hysteria , a la DDT , or similar to a tobacco company saying their ' light ' cigarettes are less likely to kill you .
Safer is not safe , of course .
The issue is that Canada limits asbestos use in Canada but has no problem exporting it .
96 % of the asbestos produced in Canada is for export to developing countries like India , Indonesia and Thailand , where it is turned into asbestos cement for construction .
A modern country like Canada or the USA , knowledgeable about the potential health effects of asbestos , can use it in a much safer way today than was possible 50 years ago , before its dangers were known .
Canada counts on the importing countries to protect its people , while critics in Canada contend that governments and business owners there do not have the oversight infrastructure or perhaps even the desire to make sure that it is used safely .
Dr. Trevor Ogden , chairman of the Health Canada report panel , said that “ Canada has a pretty bleak reputation in most of the health science world ” regarding The Health Canada report that was meant to assess the potency of chrysotile asbestos .
The editorial concludes that " Canada should do its part in alleviating the global epidemic of asbestos - related disease by ending the mining and export of chrysotile , as the WHO recommends . "
That 's because part of the Detroit deal , apparently , is that Congress also approve the next installment of $ 350 billion to bail out the banks .
That 's how you get a consensus in Congress – something for everybody and , before you know it , you have a majority .
If the auto bailout is n't approved , then congresspeople ( rightly ) will have a hard time explaining why they 're continuing to shove huge sums at the banks – even without public humiliation of their CEOs and a requirement that they sell their jet fleets .
From the New York Times :
" By breaking that impasse , the lawmakers could also clear the way for the Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , to request the remaining $ 350 billion of the financial industry bailout fund knowing he will not get bogged down in a fight over aiding Detroit …
" Under the financial system rescue law approved by Congress in October , the Treasury secretary must request the second $ 350 billion , and Congress then has 15 days to disapprove the disbursement .
Congressional leaders , upset over Mr. Paulson 's management of the bailout program , have warned him that if he wants the money , he must ask for it by the end of next week .
" Until the breakthrough Friday evening , it had appeared unlikely that Mr. Paulson would be able to persuade Congress to release the funds .
Of the first $ 350 billion portion of the rescue fund , only $ 15 billion remains uncommitted . "
" No " would have been a good answer since the original $ 350 billion was not spent as advertised – and was a bad idea to begin with .
But the administration gets a green light on the continuing bank subsidy for the small price of including the car manufacturers as well .
It 's actually true that it's hard to explain why Detroit does n't get bailed out when Wall Street does .
Bailing them both out is consistent but the wrong answer .
Let 's do the tally .
Some or all of the $ 25 billion that was supposed to pay for retooling for fuel efficient cars – but only for going concerns who could pay it back – will go as short - term survival aid instead .
But Nancy Pelosi said she only agreed to that on the promise that the retooling funds would be replenished " within a few weeks " .
So another $ 25 billion is going to come from somewhere ; that 's $ 50 billion for Detroit even forgetting that they 'll soon be back for more .
And then there 's the second $ 350 billion for the banks .
Altogether $ 400 billion .
This should put enough incentive pay in lobbyists pockets so they can buy new houses and pull us out of the housing crisis ( trickledown , you know ) .
We do n't have much leverage over our Congresspeople with the next election two years away .
They 're pretty sure they can count on us forgetting .
In fact , they voted against our wishes for the original bank bailout with an election pending .
Still does n't hurt to write them but I 'm discouraged .
Would like to believe in change .

For the past few years , Rad Geek People ’s Daily was syndicated ( along with a few score other anarchist blogs ) on a Planet - based aggregator called Anarchoblogs at http://anarchoblogs.protest.net/.
Rabble , of Anarchogeek , created it To encourage blogging , raise awareness , and and promote cross linking among anarchist bloggers .
Unfortunately , late last year , Anarchoblogs disappeared from the web ( as a result of technical difficulties not worth going into here ) .
Today , I am happy to kick off this new year by announcing the return of Anarchoblogs , which is back at a new domain name ( http://anarchoblogs.org/) with a new engine under the hood and some important new features .
From Anarchoblogs.org : About :
Anarchoblogs is a collection of blogs from self - identified anarchists , anarcho - syndicalists , anarcha - feminists , anarchists without adjectives , libertarian - socialists , autonomists and other assorted anti-statists .
We use free software to syndicate our weblogs , in order to raise awareness , bring together anarchist voices , promote cross-linking and discussion between anarchist bloggers , and to archive and index anarchist materials on the Internet , while we ’re at it .
Anarchoblogs began life in September 2004 .
It was founded by Evan Rabble Henshaw - Plath , and run with a Planet aggregator at anarchoblogs.protest.net .
Technical difficulties caused anarchoblogs.protest.net to disappear from the web in late 2008 , so Anarchoblogs contributor Charles Rad Geek Johnson contacted former contributors about establishing a new Anarchoblogs aggregator at anarchoblogs.org , with new software and some new features ( including localized hubs , archiving and indexing of posts by date , tag , and author , and a updated , semantically - richer set of aggregated feeds ) .
The new Anarchoblogs has been live since December 2008 .
A few notes on the changes .
The old Anarchoblogs was run on an old version of Planet , a simple aggregator and templating system which outputs static files .
The new Anarchoblogs is run on an installation of WordPress MU with FeedWordPress running on top of it , which will allow for more flexible templating and the new features mentioned on the About page .
Probably the three most important are that the new platform allows for painless setup and management of community hubs ; for indexing the content of anarchist blogs ; and , because each posts goes into the database of a WordPress MU blog , for archiving the content of anarchist blogs over time .
Comunity hubs — the new setup will make it easy to create and manage multiple community hubs , which aggregate blogs for specific communities , instead of simply dumping everything into one global aggregator .
( But if you want everything dumped into one global aggregator , you can still get at that easily enough . )
Communities can be defined geographically , ideologically , linguistically , organizationally , or along any other lines which become useful .
Currently , there are three hubs up and running , for their own sake and as examples for the future — the language - specific hubs Anarchoblogs in English and Anarchoblogs auf Deutsch , and the ideology - specific hub Market Anarchist Blogs .
Soon I hope to get some other ideological community hubs up ( syndicalist blogs , green anarchist blogs , that sort of thing ) and to roll out community hubs for geographical communities for various countries , cities , provinces , bioregions , etc .
I think it ’s important that we develop these community hubs , for a couple reason .
First , because every reason that makes aggregating anarchist blogs a good idea in general ( promoting conversations among anarchists , helping readers discover new anarchist blogs and anarchist bloggers discover new readers , etc. ) is also a great reason to create more specific hubs for specific communities ( helping people discover new anarchist bloggers in their own community , promoting conversations among anarchists who live near each other or are otherwise part of the same community , etc. ) .
Second , because there are a lot of anarchist blogs out there , and I hope that Anarchoblogs will encourage people to start even more , and the closer Anarchoblogs comes to aggregating all those blogs , the more closely trying to read the global feed will come to resemble trying to drink from a firehose .
This was already starting to become an issue with the old Anarchoblogs ; on the new Anarchoblogs , community hubs should help readers figure out more specifically what they want to follow and to avoid being overwhelmed by too much reading material .
Indexing anarchist discussions — the new Anarchoblogs runs on top of a standard WordPress ( MU ) installation , and so takes advantage of WordPress ’s features to index content by date , tag , and the full text of the posts , so that if you want ( for example ) to see what anarchist bloggers were talking about in January 2009 , or to findposts tagged Feminism on anarchist blogs , or to search for posts where anarchist bloggers mention Greece , you can do all those things , and it ’ll work about the same as it works on any individual blog , but will search across all the anarchist blogs we index .
Archiving anarchist discussions —
Lots of anarchist writers write only one or two things and then disappear ; lots of anarchist distros pass out small runs over a small area for a few years and then disappear ; lots of anarchist works are cheaply printed , done on the fly , and get out to only a handful of people .
Anarchist media has always been grassroots , usually seat - of - your - pants , and typically ephemeral : imeo sheets , xeroxed zines , tiny runs of amateur pamphlets or movement papers with microscopic circulations .
When most of our materials were printed this was a problem but not a crisis : an author or a distro might disappear , but the physical pamphlet or the zine would still exist , and people who took a professional interest could find old copies and preserve them for others to find .
But when blogs or websites disappear ( as they often do ) , they disappear forever .
Unless someone has archived the material elsewhere , there ’s no physical copy left for some future Labadie Collection to dig out of someone ’s attic .
Just how important this is was really driven home for me when I went through the old Anarchoblogs contributor list to try to get in touch with folks about the new project .
Out of over 100 former contributors , I was able to find a still - active blog for less than 30 blogs .
The others blogs were no longer being actively updated , or had simply disappeared from the Internet .
The old Anarchoblogs just aggregated the most recent content on contributing blogs , and discarded old posts ; the new Anarchoblogs archives posts over time in a database where they can be indexed , searched , and re-read , even if the original blog disappears from the Internet .
I think that as we spend more years working on building a grassroots , D.I.Y .
culture , we are going to find that these kind of archiving efforts are going to be more and more important for our ability to preserve what we have built in media where people come and go quickly , constantly change addresses , drop out , get yanked off , or otherwise disappear from the web .
I ’m hoping that Anarchoblogs ’s new archiving features will go a little way towards a better solution ; in any case , if they help preserve a couple of these blogs against the accidents and uncertainties of the future in this world of ours , I ’ll be happy .
Finally , I ’d like to say something briefly about funding .
I ’m hoping that Anarchoblogs will be financially self - sustaining , and that it might also provide people a convenient way to support active anarchist bloggers .
So I ’m going to go out on a limb here and try to do some fundraising for the project .
There is a small annual budget , and , once those bills are covered , any money that is raised above the budget will be distributed evenly amongst active Anarchoblogs contributors .
If there is enough interest and support in the online community to meet the ( very modest ) budget on voluntary donations , then I ’d like to stick with the voluntary donations .
If a few months have passed and it does n’t look like that ’s likely to work out , the Plan B would be to look into unobtrusive sponsorships or advertisements to cover the costs of keeping the aggregator running .
But if you think that Anarchoblogs sounds like a project you ’d like to see continue , the easiest way to make sure that that happens is to support the Anarchoblogs project with a donation at http://anarchoblogs.org/donate/.
Any contribution will make a significant difference ( we just need to cover about $ 350 in bills ; after that , any additional money goes directly to active Anarchoblogs contributors ) .
So , anyway .
Give it a look ; it ’s at http://anarchoblogs.org/.
If you use a feed reader like Google Reader or Bloglines , you can subscribe to a feed of all the posts coming over the wire at http://anarchoblogs.org/feed/
( or , if you want to subscribe to a feed for one of the various community hubs , http://eng.anarchoblogs.org/feed/ or http://deu.anarchoblogs.org/feed/ or http://market.anarchoblogs.org/feed/).
If you have an anarchist blog yourself , check out the information on how to join the community .
If you can support the project with a monetary donation , check out the information on how to donate .
If you have friends who’d be interested , point them to http://anarchoblogs.org/
or to this post .
If you have any questions , comments , concerns , applause , brickbats , suggestions about blogs you ’d like to see or features you ’d like to see in the aggregator — well , fire away in the comments section here or drop me a line .
And enjoy !

Disgraced evangelical leader Ted Haggard ’s former church disclosed Friday that the gay sex scandal that caused his downfall extends to a young male church volunteer who reported having a sexual relationship with Haggard — a revelation that comes as Haggard tries to repair his public image .
Brady Boyd , who succeeded Haggard as senior pastor of the 10,000 - member New Life Church in Colorado Springs , told The Associated Press that the man came forward to church officials in late 2006 shortly after a Denver male prostitute claimed to have had a three - year cash - for - sex relationship with Haggard .
Boyd said an “ overwhelming pool of evidence ” pointed to an “ inappropriate , consensual sexual relationship ” that “ went on for a long period of time … it was n’t a one - time act . ”
Boyd said the man was in his early 20s at the time .
He said he was certain the man was of legal age when it began .
Reached Friday night , Haggard declined to comment and said all interviews would have to be arranged through a publicist for HBO , which is airing a documentary about him this month .
Boyd said the church reached a legal settlement to pay the man for counseling and college tuition , with one condition being that none of the parties involved discuss the matter publicly .
Boyd said a Colorado Springs TV station reached him Thursday to say the young man was planning to provide a detailed report of his relationship with Haggard to the station .
Boyd said the church preferred to keep the matter private , but it was the man ’s decision to go public .
The disclosure comes as Haggard , 52 , is about to give a series of high - profile interviews to promote the cable documentary about his time in exile .
He is scheduled to appear on CNN ’s Larry King Live on Thursday , the date of the documentary ’s premiere , and already has taped “ The Oprah Winfrey Show . ”
In early 2007 , New Life Church disclosed that an investigation uncovered new evidence that Haggard engaged in “ sordid conversation ” and “ improper relationships ” — but did n’t go into detail .
Earlier , a church board member had said there was no evidence that Haggard had sexual relations with anyone but Mike Jones , the former male prostitute .
Haggard confessed to undisclosed “ sexual immorality ” after Jones ’ allegations and resigned as president of the National Association of Evangelicals and from New Life Church , where he faced being fired .
Anticipating criticism of the settlement with the former church volunteer , Boyd said Friday that it was in the best interests of all involved .
He would not name the volunteer or the settlement amount .
“ It was n’t at all a settlement to make him be quiet or not tell his story , ” Boyd said .
“ Our desire was to help him .
Here was a young man who wanted to get on with his life .
We considered it more compassionate assistance — certainly not hush money .
I know what ’s what everyone will want to say because that ’s the most salacious thing to say , but that ’s not at all what it was . ”
He said that “ secondarily , it ’s not great for our church either ” that the story be told .
Boyd said Haggard knew about the settlement two years ago .
In a letter e-mailed Friday to New Life Church members , Boyd said of the settlement and agreement not to talk :
“ This decision was made not as an attempt to conceal wrongdoings , but to protect him from those who would seek to exploit him .
His actions now suggest that he has changed his mind . ”
The letter said the church “ received reports of a number of incidents of inappropriate behavior ” after Haggard ’s fall .
“ In each case , we have tried our very best to do the right thing each time , including disciplinary action when appropriate . ”
Boyd said the “ inappropriate behavior ” referred to the man who was the volunteer involved with Haggard .
After Haggard ’s fall , another church staff member resigned after admitting to what was described as “ sexual misconduct . ”
Boyd said the church will not take action against the man if he tells his story in the news media .
“ We have legal standing to do that , but not the desire to , ” he said .
Boyd said he had spoken to the man once and came away with the impression that he was speaking out because of the documentary .
“ I think what caused this young man to be a bit aggravated was Ted being seen as a victim , when he himself had experienced a great deal of hurt , ” Boyd said .
“ I seriously doubt this man would have come forward if the documentary had not been made . ”
In an AP interview this month before an appearance in front of TV critics in California , Haggard described his sexuality as complex and something that ca n’t be put into “ stereotypical boxes . ”
MANHATTAN , Kan. , Jan. 23 ( UPI ) --
Thinking about a particular song -- no matter if the music of your life was doo - wop or disco -- can cue vivid memories of the past , U.S. researchers found .
" We thought that actually hearing the song would bring back the most vivid memories , " Richard Harris of the Kansas State University said in a statement .
" But in our study there was n't a lot of difference in memory between those who heard the song and those who did n't .
What we determined was happening is that you already know the song and you 're hearing it in your mind . "
Advertisement
Harris and Elizabeth Cady , a 2006 doctoral graduate in psychology , and J. Bret Knappenberger , an undergraduate , wanted to understand whether memories were cued by actually hearing the song or by thinking about it in other ways .
They tested 124 subjects ages 18 - 20 in spring 2003 .
A pilot study had the subjects list songs from five stages of life -- early childhood , grade school , middle school , high school and college .
Harris said he and Cady were surprised at how many participants reported strong memories associated with the same song .
For the grade - school era , 26 percent of participants had strong memories associated with Vanilla Ice 's song " Ice Ice Baby . "
For middle school , 36 percent reported strong memories associated with Coolio 's " Gangsta 's Paradise . "
The findings , published in the Psychology of Music , found music is autobiographical and people can remember events from a long time ago , with strong emotion associated with the songs played at the time .
That little extra could be due to a little extra fructose .
Peter Hince / Photographer 's Choice RF / Getty Images
­ In small amounts , HFCS should n't be any more harmful than regular sugar .
The fructose in HFCS , though modified from glucose , is structurally and in all other ways the same as natural fructose .
Additionally , HFCS has nearly the same makeup of fructose and glucose as table sugar ( most HFCS has 55 percent fructose , compared to 50 percent found in table sugar ) .
But there does seem to be a connection between the use of HFCS and obesity and type - 2 diabetes , so what gives ?
First off , that additional 10 percent of fructose content does make a difference in caloric intake , especially since HFCS is found in so many products .
Imagine a world in which all sugar has been replaced by HFCS ( not a far stretch ) :
You could eat the exact same foods , but you would be consuming 10 percent more sugar .

Unlike glucose , which is metabolized a number of ways by your body , fructose is only metabolized by your liver .
When the liver receives more fructose than it can handle , the excess sugars are turned into fats in the form of triglycerides , which are harmful to your arteries and your heart .
There 's much to be learned about how our bodies react to fructose , but researchers do know that fructose does n't stimulate production of insulin , leptin or ghrelin , all of which play a part in telling the body how much it needs to eat [ source : Havel ] .
Without receiving these internal signals to stop eating , it becomes that much easier for us to continue chowing down on that pint of double - chocolate fudge ice cream .
The biggest problem is that HFCS is being added to food items that do n't normally have sugar and that you would n't even describe as sweet -- crackers , for instance .
So , not only are we chugging down lots of sugars with our sodas , but your PBJ sandwich could have HFCS in each of its three ingredients .
Meal after meal , day after day , all of this extra sugar adds up , and that , and not necessarily the qualities of HFCS itself , is likely one reason why rates for obesity and diabetes have climbed since the introduction of HFCS .
( Other factors are in play as well , such as decreased activity and exercise levels and increased fat consumption . )
So what can we do ?
Well , for starters , do everything you 're already supposed to do .
Get regular exercise , watch your fat intake and get regular medical checkups .
Next , it would n't hurt to mimic the practices of those strange ( and rare ) individuals in grocery - store aisles who read the labels of the food they are purchasing .
Once you get in this habit , you will likely be shocked to learn just how much of your regular grocery purchases contain high - fructose corn syrup .
If nearly all of your food contains concentrated sugars , it stands to reason that you 'll be eating too many sugars .
And if you want to go crazy , eat some fruits and veggies .
You 'll get all the glucose you need ( not much ) , and these healthier alternatives will take the place of the less healthy foods now flooding our markets and grocery stores .

NEW YORK , Jan 1 ( Reuters ) - Bank of America Corp BAC.N completed its purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co on Thursday , creating the largest U.S. bank and perhaps one of the biggest challenges yet for longtime Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis .
The closing allows Bank of America to bypass JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup Inc C.N in size , giving it about $ 2.7 trillion of assets .
Bank of America had said it expected to issue 1.71 billion common shares , equal to $ 24.1 billion , plus 359,100 preferred shares in the merger .
Merrill shareholders received 0.8595 of a Bank of America common share for each of their common shares .
The transaction , originally valued at $ 50 billion , came to fruition in the early morning of Sept. 15 , about an hour before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK went bankrupt , and may have saved Merrill from a similar fate .
It ends more than 94 years of independence for Merrill , after a year when the five top Wall Street banks were bought , went bankrupt , or changed their business structures .
Lewis is swallowing Merrill ’s “ thundering herd ” of 17,000 brokers , which he has called the “ crown jewel ” of the acquisition .
He is also absorbing Merrill ’s big investment bank , which by volume ranked fifth in debt and equity underwriting and third in merger advice in 2008 , Thomson Reuters data show .
The combined company ’s brokerage , credit card , investment banking , mortgage and wealth management operations , plus its deposit base , will make it the nation ’s largest or close to it .
Bank of America also takes over Merrill 's nearly 50 percent stake in the powerful money manager BlackRock Inc BLK.N .
“ We are now uniquely positioned to win market share and expand our leadership position in markets around the world , ” Lewis said in a statement on Thursday .
The Charlotte , North Carolina - based bank did not immediately return calls seeking further comment .
NEW CHALLENGES
The transaction creates new challenges for Bank of America , whose shares fell 66 percent last year as the worsening economy led to soaring loan losses , including from Countrywide Financial Corp , which Bank of America bought in July .
Lewis must stem defections even as he prepares to cut at least 30,000 jobs overall to help save $ 7 billion a year by 2012 .
And while Bank of America and Merrill together raised $ 25 billion of capital from the U.S. Treasury Department ’s $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program , many analysts have said they may need more .
Bank of America in October halved its dividend , and some analysts said another cut might be needed .
Lewis faces a radically changed banking landscape that also includes Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N $ 12.7 billion acquisition on Wednesday of Charlotte - based rival Wachovia Corp .
John
Thain , who became Merrill ’s chief executive after losses in mortgage - related investments led to the October 2007 ouster of Stanley O’Neal , agreed to run the merged company ’s global banking , securities and wealth management businesses .
If he stays , Thain will be a prime candidate to eventually replace Lewis , who is 61 and became chief executive in 2001 .
Other potential candidates include Barbara Desoer , who runs the mortgage operations including the former Countrywide , and Brian Moynihan , whom Thain displaced as head of investment banking but was named general counsel , reporting to Lewis .
Before buying Merrill , Lewis had spent close to $ 110 billion to buy FleetBoston Financial Corp , credit card issuer MBNA Corp , LaSalle Bank Corp , the U.S. Trust wealth business , and Countrywide .
And despite the industry turmoil , the bank has so far survived , and is widely considered to be too large to be allowed to fail .
Lewis was last month named Banker of the Year for the second time by the trade newspaper American Banker .

How to put this on your own web site .
There was an anniversary at the end of 2008 you might have missed – 5 December marked 50 years since a young Queen Elizabeth II , who was in Bristol , made a direct telephone call to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh , 300 miles away .
Before that day , to make a long - distance call required the services of a pencil - wielding operator .
Fifty years later , and after countless more footnotes in the history of communications , 2008 will also be remembered as a landmark year .
It will be known as the " year of the smart phone " .
Back in 1958 , all phones were smart but today to qualify a blower must do a lot more than secure a direct line to Scotland .
Smartphones will , among other things , tell your Facebook friends that you 're hangover is a bad as predicted , transmogrify into a wind instrument known as an ocarina , and recognise the Abba track you heard on Mamma Mia ! , download it from the internet and play it .
And that 's on top of the functions we 've come to expect from our mobiles – things like texting , telling us the time and , say , phoning people .
" Things really have moved forward in the past 12 months , " says Rhiain Morgan at T3 magazine .
" Where once you used to have MP3 players , phones , cameras , and a device for emailing , 2008 was the year they became one . "
It was also the year we learnt to touch .
Salivating among " iFans " peaked at the end of 2007 as Apple unveiled its mighty iPhone .
With its sleek lines and giant gleaming screen , it became the must - have gadget of 2008 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The first phone to dispense almost entirely with buttons ; it relied instead on users to stroke its multi - touch screen ( something they were bursting to do ) .
Demand for the iPhone only increased with the release of the improved 3G version in July ( worldwide , Apple sold a million of the things in the first three days ) .
Meanwhile , rivals raced to satisfy demand for touch screens .
But why did this Apple - inspired seduction by touch come only in 2008 ?
As Adam Leach , a mobile phones expert at the analysts , Ovum , says , " the technology is actually quite old .
PDAs have had touch screens for more than 10 years , but when they became smartphones they lost that capability .
Manufacturers such as Nokia were concentrating on one - handed use and the keypad being the best way to control small screens .
Then when Apple looked at larger screens , they thought rather than adding touch they would create a whole experience around it . "
A measure of the way touch has taken off is that Research in Motion , the Canadian makers of the BlackBerry , ditched the Qwerty keypad that has become its trademark in favour of the world 's first pressable touch screen ( the whole screen clicks when pushed to reassure those for those who would miss the mechanical certainty of buttons ) .
But while the BlackBerry Storm has received generally good reviews since its November release , the race has left some straggling .
" I think manufacturers have looked at the iPhone with short - sightedness , " says Carolina Milanesi , who heads up mobiles research at the analysts Gartner .
" They thought that if they have touch , consumers will be as excited about it as they were about the iPhone .
But that 's not it – what makes the iPhone successful is its usability and 2009 is going to be about rivals improving that . "
After touch , the second key development in the smartphone showdown has been the birth of Google 's Android operating system , as seen on the lauded G1 .
The phone lacks the good looks of the iPhone or the Storm but sets the standard as the first open source phone – anyone can design applications and make them available at the Android Marketplace .
Unlike Apple 's App Store , where iPhoners in their droves can get hold of the ocarina and Facebook applications ( Apple says more than 300 million applications had been downloaded by November ) Google has no control over content – the smartphone has become fully customisable and the App phenomenon is set to gather pace in 2009 .
There is , however , what Adam Leach calls an " economic black cloud " hanging over the industry .
Several analysts say handset sales are shrinking for the first time in eight years as fewer of us fork out up front for expensive contracts to use fancy phones .
Despite this , Milanesi predicts the number of us upgrading to smartphones will increase overall – only about 10 per cent of phones currently fit the bill – we'll just keep them longer and operators will have to offer more tempting deals .
Crucially , Milanesi says " the phones will also have to be better " .
One firm hoping its phone will be best in 2009 is Nokia , a name that has been absent from the trinity of super smartphones that have shaken up the industry ( the iPhone , the Storm , and the G1 ) .
" We 're very excited about the Nokia N97 , " says Morgan at T3 of the phone , which is set for release later this year .
Its features will include a whopping 32 GB of built - in storage and " social location " , which will use GPS and a compass automatically to inform friends of your whereabouts ( thus , Nokia hopes , appealing to the Facebook generation ) .
A relative sleeping giant in the smartphone stakes , the Finnish phone maker can be expected to wake up with a start when the N97 goes on sale .
" The iPhone will still be the phone to beat in 2009 , " Milanesi says , " but Nokia , with its overall 38 per cent market share , remains the manufacturer to beat .
If they get the right device , it could be game over . "
Battery Blues
A phone is not mobile when it 's plugged into the mains by your microwave .
And , as smartphones come bursting with ever more energy - hungry features , that 's where they 're spending most of their time .
Gone are the days of weekly charging – the worst smartphone performers give up the ghost in just a few hours .
" Battery life is one of the big inhibitors in the market , " says Adam Leach , an analyst at Ovum .
" We 're seeing huge increases in processor speed , memory and disc drive size , but only incremental improvements in battery technology . "
Manufacturers are already experimenting with less power - hungry screens and more efficient hardware , but most predict battery life will get worse before it improves .
One glimmer of hope on the horizon is what 's known as " WiTricity " , or wireless charging .
When it takes off ( do n't hold your breath ) it will mean your phone charges as soon as its range of a power hotspot , even if it 's still in your handbag , sitting on your desk , or by that microwave .

Reem Asaad 's campaign has been gaining pace on a social networking site
By Stephanie Hancock
BBC News , Jeddah
It would be bizarre in any country to find that its lingerie shops are staffed entirely by men .
But in Saudi Arabia - an ultra-conservative nation where unmarried men and women cannot even be alone in a room together if they are not related - it is strange in the extreme .
Women , forced to negotiate their most intimate of purchases with male strangers , call the situation appalling and are demanding the system be changed .
Girls feel uncomfortable when males are selling them lingerie , telling them what size they need ... he 's totally checking the girls out !
Rana Jad
" The way that underwear is being sold in Saudi Arabia is simply not acceptable to any population living anywhere in the modern world , " says Reem Asaad , a finance lecturer at Dar al - Hikma Women 's College in Jeddah , who is leading a campaign to get women working in lingerie shops rather than men .
" This is a sensitive part of women 's bodies , " adds Ms Asaad .
" You need to have some discussions regarding size , colour and attractive choices and you definitely do n't want to get into such a discussion with a stranger , let alone a male stranger .
I mean this is something I would n't even talk to my friends about . "
In theory , it should be easy enough to get women to staff lingerie shops , but parts of Saudi society are still very traditional and do n't like the idea of women working - even if it 's just to sell underwear to each other .
FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Rana Jad is a 20 - year - old student at Dar al - Hikma Women 's College , and one of Reem Asaad 's pupils and campaign supporters .
" Girls do n't feel very comfortable when males are selling them lingerie , telling them what size they need , and saying ' I think this is small on you , I think this is large on you ' , " she says .
" He 's totally checking the girls out !
It 's just not appropriate , especially here in our culture . "
Embarrassing experience Nura , an administrative clerk at the same college , says she never buys lingerie in Saudi Arabia anymore .
" It 's really embarrassing .
They try to give comments -' this might suit you better than that ' - it 's really not ethical . "
Saudi women must buy all garments untried , as fitting rooms are banned
To be fair to the male shop workers , many of them find the experience just as embarrassing as their women customers .
They are torn , says Ms Asaad , between trying to do their job as salespeople and not stepping on any toes by doing something inappropriate , that could land them in hot water .
" Since we do have the option of replacing male salespeople with female salespeople I do n't see why this situation should continue . "
Because physical contact between unmarried men and women in Saudi Arabia is forbidden under strict segregation laws , women can also not be properly measured for their underwear .
Worse still , the kingdom 's religious police forbid lingerie shops even to have fitting rooms .
So if a customer wants to try an item on , she first has to pay for it , and then traipse to a public toilet to see if it fits .
If it does n't , she can easily get a refund , but most women find the experience so humiliating they buy items without trying them on , only to get them home and find they do n't fit and their money is wasted .
Frustration Ms Asaad 's campaign began on the social networking website Facebook and is gradually getting larger .
Even Saudi Arabia 's male - dominated press is starting to take note , with several newspapers reporting on her fight .
We the consumers are the final decision makers
Reem Asaad
The situation is all the more frustrating because the relevant legislation is already in place .
In 2006 , the Saudi government passed a law stating that women should be allowed to staff any shops that sell women 's items , be it clothing , accessories or underwear .
But the law has still not been properly implemented .
No official reason is given for this , but one probable cause is that hiring female staff would put a lot of men out of work - not a popular move in a country where 13 % of men are unemployed .
There are also Saudi Arabia 's Muslim clerics to contend with .
They wield a great deal of power in the kingdom and still believe a woman 's natural environment is in the home .
The result is an uneasy stand off between those who want Saudi Arabia to modernise and others who want to preserve conservative traditions - and currently , the traditionalists are winning .
Ms Asaad and her campaigners have now decided to sidestep both the government and the religious establishment , and put pressure directly on retailers .
Campaigners are calling for a boycott of all lingerie stores that are staffed by men .
" We the consumers are the final decision makers , " says Ms Asaad .
" It 's we who decide what to buy or not to buy , and that 's where it will hit the most - in the pocket . "
Campaigners stress they still want customers ' male family members to be able to enter shops , but insist all staff selling products must be women .
" The concept is flawless , " says Ms Asaad .
" The concept of women selling women 's underwear to other women is so natural that any other option is just invalid . "

Democrats Inch Toward Torture Probe As President Barack Obama reverses some of ex-President George W. Bush ’s most controversial “ war on terror ” policies , a consensus seems to be building among Democratic congressional leaders that further investigations are needed into Bush ’s use of torture and other potential crimes .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly On Wednesday – the first working day of the Obama administration – Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he would support funding and staff for additional fact - finding by the Senate Armed Services Committee , which last month released a report tracing abuse of detainees at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib to Bush ’s Feb.
7 , 2002 , decision to exclude terror suspects from Geneva Convention protections .
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin , who issued that report , echoed Reid ’s comments , saying “ there needs to be an accounting of torture in this country . ”
Levin , D - Michigan , also said he intends to encourage the Justice Department and incoming Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate torture practices that took place while Bush was in office .
Two other key Democrats joined in this growing chorus of lawmakers saying that serious investigations should be conducted .
Sen . Sheldon Whitehouse , D - Rhode Island , a former federal prosecutor and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said in a floor speech , “ As the President looks forward and charts a new course , must someone not also look back , to take an accounting of where we are , what was done , and what must now be repaired . ”
Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland told reporters : " Looking at what has been done is necessary . ”
On Jan. 18 , two days before Obama ’s inauguration , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed support for House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ’s plan to create a blue - ribbon panel of outside experts to probe the “ broad range ” of policies pursued by the Bush administration “ under claims of unreviewable war powers . ”
In an interview with Fox News ’ Chris Wallace , Pelosi specifically endorsed a probe into the politicization of the Justice Department , but did n’t spell out a position on Conyers 's plan to examine the Bush administration ’s torture and rendition policies , which could prove embarrassing to Pelosi and other Democratic leaders who were briefed by the CIA about these tactics .
Still , when Wallace cited Obama ’s apparent unwillingness to investigate the Bush administration , Pelosi responded : “ I think that we have to learn from the past , and we cannot let the politicizing of the — for example , the Justice Department , to go unreviewed .
Past is prologue .
We learn from it .
And my views on the subject — I do n't think that Mr. Obama and Mr. Conyers are that far apart . ”
The emerging consensus among top congressional Democrats for some form of investigation into Bush ’s controversial policies has surprised some progressives who had written off the leadership long ago for blocking impeachment hearings and other proposals for holding Bush and his subordinates accountable .
In 2006 , for instance , Pelosi famously declared that “ impeachment is off the table , ” and prior to Election 2008 , the Democratic leadership largely acquiesced to Bush ’s demands for legislation that supported his “ war on terror ” policies , including a compromise bill granting legal immunity to telecommunications companies that assisted in Bush ’s warrantless wiretaps .
A Changed Tone Since the election – in which the Democrats increased their congressional majorities and won the White House – key Democrats have begun releasing more information about Bush ’s abuses of power .
Besides Levin ’s findings on mistreatment of detainees , Conyers published a 487 - page report entitled " Reining in the Imperial Presidency : Lessons and Recommendations Relating to the Presidency of George W. Bush ” that calls for the creation of a blue - ribbon panel and independent criminal probes into the Bush administration ’s conduct in the “ war on terror . ”
Conyers urged the Attorney General to “ appoint a Special Counsel or expand the scope of the present investigation into CIA tape destruction to determine whether there were criminal violations committed pursuant to Bush administration policies that were undertaken under unreviewable war powers , including enhanced interrogation , extraordinary rendition , and warrantless domestic surveillance . ”
Last year , Bush ’s Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham as special counsel to investigate whether the destruction of CIA videotapes that depicted interrogators waterboarding alleged terrorist detainees violated any laws .
Durham was not given the authority to probe whether the interrogation techniques themselves violated anti-torture laws .
“ At present , the Attorney General has agreed only to appoint a special U.S. Attorney to determine whether the destruction of videotapes depicting the waterboarding of a detainee constituted violations of federal law , ” Conyers ’s report said .
“ Despite requests from Congress , that prosecutor has not been asked to investigate whether the underlying conduct being depicted – the waterboarding itself or other harsh interrogation techniques used by the military or the CIA – violated the law .
…
Appointment of a special counsel would be in the public interest ( e.g. , it would help dispel a cloud of doubt over our law enforcement system ) . ”
Additional evidence about the Bush administration ’s actions is expected to become available in the coming weeks as the Obama administration loosens the secrecy that has surrounded Bush ’s “ war on terror , ” a phrase that Obama and his team have effectively dropped from Washington ’s lexicon .
Obama ’s aides have indicated that there soon may be a “ public airing ” of secret Justice Department legal opinions and other documents that provided the underpinning for the Bush administration ’s brutal interrogation policies .
Levin also indicated that he expects to release the full Armed Services Committee report – covering an 18 - month investigation – in about two or three weeks .
Levin added that he would ask the Senate Intelligence Committee to conduct its own investigation of torture as implemented by the CIA .
Meanwhile , Republicans have grown increasingly worried that Holder , as Attorney General , will launch a criminal investigation into Bush ’s interrogation policies .
They delayed a vote on his nomination demanding that he respond to questions about whether he intends to investigate and / or prosecute Bush administration officials .
Sen .
John Cornyn , R - Texas , said he wants to ask Holder whether he intends to investigate the Bush administration and intelligence officials for torture
Last week , at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Holder was asked about the practice of waterboarding , a form of simulated drowning that the Bush administration has acknowledged using against three terror suspects .
Holder answered that “ waterboarding was torture . ”
Cornyn said Holder ’s view means there is a possibility that investigations might be on the horizon .
" Part of my concern , frankly , relates to some of his statements at the hearing in regard to torture and what his intentions are with regard to intelligence personnel who were operating in good faith based upon their understanding of what the law was , " Cornyn said Wednesday .

The ‘ Why ’ of Interstellar Flight
From the standpoint of pure research , one of the arguments for not going to nearby stars is that by the time we develop the needed technologies , we ’ll have no need to make the journey .
After all , we ’ll soon be able to learn vast amounts about nearby worlds from space - based telescopes , not to mention planned Earth - side instruments like the European Extremely Large Telescope , a 42 - meter powerhouse 100 more sensitive than the best of today ’s optical telescopes .
Putting observatories on the far side of the Moon is another way we ’ll see deeper than ever before .
Extend space research out fifty years , a hundred , and you have to reckon with capabilities we can only dream about today .
Webster Cash ( University of Colorado ) has been championing one Sun - shade design ( there are others ) that in its fullest deployment could give us views of an exoplanet as if we were no more than a hundred kilometers away .
Or consider the fusion of new propulsion technologies with space - based observatories that can tap the Sun ’s gravitational focus .
This would open up the galaxy for the detailed exploration of countless planetary systems , with the potential for exoplanet finds as far away as Andromeda .
An Earth - based Perspective
All this is given relevance ( and perspective ) by the upcoming launch of Kepler , which will look for transiting planets down to terrestrial size .
And as I was pondering these issues , there came the news of not one but two ground - based detections of exoplanet atmospheres .
Six hundred images of the hot Jupiter OGLE - TR - 56 b , from the ESO ’s Very Large Telescope and Carnegie ’s Magellan - Baade instrument in Chile , produced the first result .
This one is quite a catch , the planet being some 5,000 light years away in the direction of galactic center .
Listen to Mercedes López - Morales ( Carnegie Institution ) on last summer ’s work :
“ Others have tried to detect planetary atmospheres from Earth , but to no avail …
The successful recipe is a planet that emits a lot of heat and has little to no wind in its atmosphere .
Plus it has to be a clear , calm night on Earth to measure accurately the differences in thermal emissions when the planet is eclipsed as it goes behind the star .
Only about one of every 3,000 photons from the star comes from the planet .
This eclipse allows us to separate the emissions of the planet from those of the star .
The magic moments came on July 2nd … ”
In the same issue of Astronomy & Astrophysics comes news of the measurement of thermal emissions in the near - infrared from TrES - 3b , another hot Jupiter studied from the ground .
This work is out of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands , again relying on accurate information about the planetary transit that allows the strength of the planet ’s light to be measured .
The instruments involved were the William Herschel Telescope ( WHT ) on La Palma ( Canary Islands , Spain ) and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope ( UKIRT ) on Mauna Kea in Hawaii .
Given this early work on exoplanetary atmospheres from Earth , where will we be in fifty years ?
And if , let ’s say in a century , we find ourselves with the capability of studying distant planetary systems in exquisite detail , will we still have the motivation to build ships to make the journey to them ?
From a planetary security perspective , we can theoretically safeguard our species by expanding out in our own system with space - based habitats and possibly terraforming as options .
The question then remains :
What is it that drives the push to interstellar flight ?
Philosophy and Realism
Many answers suggest themselves , and I ’m not inclined to wax philosophical here .
I think a realistic answer is that as we expand into the Solar System and build the infrastructure to support human populations in space , we will inevitably develop the tools that make further explorations possible , including propulsion technologies to get us to the Oort Cloud and beyond .
Human history tells me that there is always a portion of the population that is willing to get on a cramped ship and go to the other side of nowhere for reasons that vary from the pure exploratory impulse to the need to escape political or religious persecution .
And my guess is that at some point interstellar flight will begin in much the same way .
Protecting the species by spreading into the cosmos is a laudable goal , but it couples neatly with this exploratory imperative that has shown up in the behavior of our ancestors and shows no signs of abating now .
Indeed , a universal exploratory urge is part of the puzzle noted by Fermi ’s paradox —
‘ Where are they ’ indeed , for we would expect anyone with the capability of making an interstellar journey to set about the task .
That ’s because we know deep down that that is exactly what we would do — will do — assuming we survive our technological coming of age and can develop the engines to make it happen .

We all have our fluctuating lists of top horror films .. but what about television ?
Many of us were weaned on seeing horror on tv when we were too young to get to the theaters or convince our families that we could handle the scary stuff in a big , dark room .. but lately I ’ve thought about television ’s ability to give us the same chills .
So I decided to look back and find what , to me , were the scariest things I ’ve experienced on television - in media made specifically for television , not movies I simply discovered at home .
Looking back , let ’s see if any of you have these in common .
A few of these do n’t hold up but never left my scarred brain .
Some still frighten me to no end .
Enjoy .
Adam ( Evil ) Barnick ’s Top Ten Scariest Television Moments
10 ) Salem 's Lot : The Boy at the window
This was one my parents used to speak of which I got to witness in the mid-80's , when most of these stories were screened and freaked me to no end .
While Barlow 's Nosferatu - esque appearance is effective as was the rest of the tale , it was the vampiric boy at the window , ceaselessly grinning ( an unusual yet potent fear of mine , strange / uncanny grins ) , scratching at the window to be let in .
Does n't the other kid think this is remotely strange ?
I like how he ’s borderline pleased to see him , not thinking the floating is remotely out of order .
Of all the items I will mention on this list , this is the one I hear the most referenced by other horror fans who saw it growing up .
9 ) The X - Files : Humbug
One of the first intentionally comedic episodes of the paranormal series was one of the ones that turned me inside out back in the day .
Mulder and Scully investigate the town of Gibsonton , Florida where members of a traveling circus sideshow are dying under mysterious circumstances .
A Basket Case - esque revelation reveals the killer is the underdeveloped twin of one of the lead ' freaks ' , with the ability to leave its host body for periods of time .
For such a darkly comic episode , the rare flashes of " Leonard " streaking through the frame or attacking potential new hosts revealed a truly unsettling design .
Some good suspense in this episode , but primarily the twisted design of the twin coupled with his sudden attacks that got me .
8 ) Tales from the Darkside : ' Inside The Closet '
While even as a kid I found the show enjoyably cheesy , this episode was the one that floored lil ' Barnick .
A college student moves into an older man 's upstairs spare room on campus , but warned not to use the small boxlike closet in the corner .
Naturally curiosity gets the better of her as she notices shoes missing , items scattered .. and it 's revealed early on that SOMETHING makes the little closet its home .. and it does n't like the new guest .
The episode ’s two creepiest moments ..
The young woman investigates a noise at night and finds nothing ; as she lifts her heels off the floor to settle into slumber , a bleach - white emaciated clawed hand reaches for her ankle and misses .
As she sleeps , a small shaft of moonlight illuminates SOMETHING under there , waiting .
Every child ’s fear that made them hop quickly into bed made manifest .
That 's already enough to give any kid phobias ; but it was the reveal / assault to follow that really messed with ten - year old yours truly .
As with most of these , the FX are dated but admirable given the time .
The thing in the closet , " Lizzie " , is still a truly disturbing design , and its horrible crackle - noises still get me .
But THE moment , which I remember being far more effective as a kid but is still pretty tough , was when Lizzie jumps on the heroine 's back , and yanks her to the floor , breaking her neck before she even collapses .
Brrr .
Need I say more ?
This was a late bloomer for me ( I did n't see it on television until 1990 ) and yet while the idea seems ludicrous , and probably looks so if you 're raised on modern FX , there 's something about the Zuni fetish doll that seems to freak out anyone who experienced it at the right time in their lives .
Basically the Tasmanian devil on espresso , the relentless doll endlessly screaming , chasing and slashing Karen Black was already unsettling when it was inanimate ( that face ! ) and is even crazier when set free of its protective chain .
And to top it off , we have that chair - gripping ending image where even though Ms. Black defeated the doll 's body , she perished fighting its spirit .
6 ) V : The Final Battle : The Birthing Scene
I still consider this a well - made series and have enjoyed revisiting it on occasion over the years ; as a wee lad it was a stirring sci fi monster story , and as you grow you realize just what the story ( at least the original miniseries ) symbolizes .
Actually I 'm not sure how I missed the symbolism even as a kid , it 's not even remotely subtle ..
This scene may have been the thing that wore down over time in terms of fear , but truly chilled lil ' Barnick to the bone when he was too young to be seeing it .
Robin Maxwell ( Blair Tefkin ) is shocked to learn her pregnancy from a Visitor may be far from human .. and even more shocking are the green blemishes on her neck counting down her cycle and the fact that it 's keeping her emotions and impulses in check , literally stopping her from killing herself .
Already a dread - driven premise , this scene at the time ( I still feel , with the exception of the FX , it holds up ) was the one that kept me WIDE awake ..
I 'm pretty sure I asked to sleep with my parents that night .
Quite a nice misdirect when you first think Robin had a normal baby , then realize she 's had TWO that are n't what she was expecting , as a seemingly human child comes out twisted
and then its TWIN comes out even worse :
" Sally ... we want you !
" An obvious inspiration for ' Inside the Closet ' , another late bloomer , I had n't seen until the late 80's ..
This one , you know it even if you do n't know the title .
Everyone who has seen it remembers it and I 'm sure any kid who grew up in the 70's / early 80's thought twice about investigating that creaking floorboard after seeing it .
Alex and Sally inherit her grandparent 's old dark house , in need of serious maintenance , especially the bricked up study and fireplace .
Naturally she ignores the pleas of the handyman who worked on the house 20 years prior and breaks both open , unleashing strange creatures who have been in the house for possibly forever .. and may have taken her grandfather away when he made the same discovery .
The ominous house , thick atmosphere , whispering , taunting voices coming from the dark , and a proper downbeat ending ; it 's a perfect little Halloween chiller , marred only by the fact that the creatures look like stuntmen with shag carpet stapled to their bodies and are on the receiving end of one too many closeups .
( Ghoulies has scarier beasts . )
Still , when the things are hiding and discussing what to do with her , it 's eerie .
The thought of being trapped forever with the imps was far more frightening to me than the overall atmosphere .
I have n't seen it since I was 12 or so but I 'm sure most of it still holds up .
Now we hit one of the rare X - Files episodes that dealt with a completely HUMAN monster .
Foreshadowing the work Chris Carter would explore in Millennium a few years later , the FBI investigates / discovers a series of murders committed by ' death fetishist ' , Donnie Pfaster ( Nick Chinlund ) .
Calm , quiet , nasal - voiced Donnie suggests great anger hidden in a boy trapped in a man 's body , and is one of the more unsettling performances I 'd seen on the show .
Add to it his rituals of washing the hair and nails ( and keeping samples to boot ) from his victims and the fact that Scully has nightmares ( or is it visions ? ) of him as a shadowy , Satanic being , and you get some prime television spooky .
3 ) Twin Peaks : The Finale
SPOILERS !!
Avoid if you do n’t know the show ..
While fans of David Lynch ’s offbeat soap opera / mystery / existential detective series had waned in season 2 after its key question ( Who killed Laura Palmer ? ) was answered , after a few episodes wading in sub-par narratives the plot kicked into gear again .
Straightlaced , eccentric hero Dale Cooper ( the FBI agent portrayed by Kyle Maclachlan ) faced two nemeses ; his insane mentor , retired FBI agent Windom Earle , and The Black Lodge , an alternate dimension ( in a manner of speaking ) referenced in Indian and Tibetan legend which defied comprehension and was the supernatural source of ‘ evil in these woods ’ often referenced by townsfolk .
Over time in the show the Lodge was not only revealed to be real and accessible , but the actual goal of Agent Earle , formerly assumed to be simply out for revenge on Cooper .
Twin Peaks ’ cliffhanger finale , never resolved due to the show ’s cancellation , saw Cooper discover the Lodge and enter , trying to stop Earle and save his love , Annie ( Heather Graham )
What followed was 15 uninterrupted minutes of the strangest television I ’ve ever seen ; though following a story and answering some questions series viewers had over the previous year , this surrealistic assault of Cooper ’s past traumas , riddles , shifts of time and bodily form ( characters constantly turn into other characters or disappear ) is something that I found initially bizarre and with little context .. after time and repeat viewings it has grown into one of the scariest things I ’ve seen on television .
If you ’ve never seen the show it may come off as the brain - burst of a pretentious art - student run amok .
If you had really followed the show and / or had a bizarre fear of the uncanny ( as I do ) , it was a flat - out mind - rape .
Human characters acting non-human , freezing , behaving as imitations of human form while Cooper was confused , chased , bleeding and trapped in a labyrinth of red curtains ..
I could n’t take it .
The screaming , insane dopplegangers ( white - eyed shadow - selves of key cast members ) did n’t make it any easier .
And the show ended with one of the most downbeat , scream - at - the - TV endings I ’d ever experienced .
It 's still admirable something this dark got onto network TV .
The pilot in particular , with its damp Seattle settings and effective capturing of the encroaching fear that rising societal violence and the year 2000 might bring , is the type of tale you need a shower and a cupcake after experiencing .
While its tone through three seasons was wildly uneven , Millennium ’s initial episode / assault of rain , dire warnings , hallucinations of bleeding strippers writhing in burning rooms , men on fire in the woods ( ! ) etc. was and is this , to me , is one of the few things on the list that still holds up in the fear and dread factor .
The scene that took the cake involved finding one of the Frenchman 's ( the show ’s first serial killer ) victims : while alive , he'd been buried in a casket in the woods , with not only his mouth sewn shut , but his eyes AND his wrists / hands stitched up as well so he could n't even bang on the coffin for help .
Ceaselessly screaming a muffled scream when found and never set free from the bonds on camera , this made me quite unsurprised the show caused intense controversy upon its 1996 debut .
1 ) Twin Peaks : The murder (s )
More spoilers !
Few directors who have n’t really made official horror films can disturb like David Lynch .
Whenever he ’d step in to direct an episode of the show you could count on the eccentricity / behavior doubling , the pace slowing to a beautiful , non-television - like crawl , and the scary scenes becoming ten times as frightening .
Lynch stepped in during season 2 of the show to direct four episodes .
The second season opener and followup , the seventh episode ( referenced later in this part ) , and the finale .
While trying not to reveal too much , both involved murders of key characters .. the first one ended the first episode of season 2 , when beaten coma victim Ronette Pulaski snapped out of unconsciousness to remember what happened to her and her friend the night they were attacked .
For a sequence with no blood or physical impact really shown , this packed quite a punch and kept me awake in high school .
Check it on DVD with proper sound if you really want a beating .
Sadly it ’s a bit dark on here and missing the slow , still , eerie buildup to this moment .
The second murder occurred six episodes later , as Laura Palmer ’s cousin Madeline made plans to return home to Montana after helping console Laura ’s grieving parents .
The entire episode is thick with dread , with key players intuitively feeling that ‘ something is happening . ’
And it does .
In an absolutely startling sequence , soundtracked by a record endlessly circling on its player after the song ended , Laura ’s mother Sarah hallucinates and passes out in her living room , drugged .
Her seemingly oblivious husband is nearby putting on a sharp suit .
Later we return to this scene after Cooper , picking up on the psychic disturbance , is flat out told by a Giant apparition ( Carel Struycken , returning after visiting Cooper in an earlier episode ) that ‘ it is happening again ’ even though he ’s not told how or where .
Back in Sarah ’s house , Madeline smells something burning and enters the Palmer ’s living room , only to be met with the nastiest murder I ’ve ever seen on TV .
Absolutely disturbing , it constantly flashes back and forth between the killer ’s outward form and his true form , showing what Maddy sees and what ’s really happening .
The killer beats her , dances with her limp choking body , and kisses her for what goes on for what feels like forever .. before taking her and smashing her head into a picture on the wall , cracking the glass and her at the same time .
He leans down and inserts a small letter under her fingernail with an exacto knife ( the killer ’s signature ) while glaring at her lifeless body .
We cut back to Cooper , still deciphering the signs around him .. while all around him begin to break down in anguish they do n’t understand .
I ’ve tried to keep this as vague as I can , but trust me - they do n’t even do things this nasty / scary on network television NOW .
It ’s not hideously bloody but it is violent and disturbing as hell .
Twin Peaks ’ most nervewracking moment , and the buildup to the murder remains the scariest thing , personally , I have witnessed on television .
It still scares me today to the degree it did in 1990 .
Seek the show out on high quality dvd and then write me to tell me you agree or I ’m insane .. just check it out .
We ’re so used to today binging on TV shows on DVD , you ’ll get to it quickly .
So in conclusion : surrealism , smiles and little rubber puppets did the most damage to me growing up .:- DYour turn : what freaked you silly on TV , as a child or recently ?

San Jose de los Perros , Nicaragua —  Greenspan backs nationalization ,  says a headline .
Well , that does it for us .
If Greenspan is in favor of it , we ’re against it .
No one man bears more responsibility for the present worldwide financial crisis and coming depression that Alan Greenspan .
The Fed ’s job is to take the punchbowl away when the party gets too wild , said former Fed chairman William McChesney Martin .
Greenspan did no such thing .
As soon as the party began to quiet down and people began fumbling for their car keys , Greenspan added more rum to the punch and turned up the music .
By the time the credit cops finally shut it down , people were dancing on tabletops all over the world .
And now , poor Mr. Obama has to deal with the headaches .
Yesterday , the Dow held steady .
But the Dow is a bit of a fraud anyway .
Failing stocks are routinely removed .
In the present case , financial stocks slipped below $ 10 and were taken out of the index .
Result : the index does not measure real world results .
Elsewhere in the financial news , oil traded at $ 37 at close of business yesterday .
The dollar rose — to $ 1.25 per euro .
And gold added another $ 10 , to bring it to $ 978 .
Gold looks a bit stretched .
It could be ready for another pull back .
But the bull market in gold is unlikely to end anytime soon .
What is odd is that while gold goes up , so does the dollar .
And so do U.S. Treasury bonds .
It is as if investors could n’t make up their minds .
They bid up the price of U.S. Treasuries and bid up the price of anti-Treasuries at the same time .
What gives ?
On the right side of their brains , they figure that U.S. Treasury bonds are the only place you can put your money and be sure of getting it back .
Stocks are a disaster .
Bonds — except for U.S. Treasuries — are too risky ; heck , even England could go broke .
Commodities ?
We ’ve seen what can happen there just look at oil !
Even gold could easily take a 20 % haircut .
That ’s why U.S. Treasury bonds are the place to be .
But wait the left side of the brain is sending a message too .
Buy gold , it says ; something fishy is going on in the Treasury bond market , it tells us .
How it is possible that the feds can borrow trillions of dollars without causing interest rates to rise ?
How can they increase the quantity of something so much without lowering its quality ?
Where ’s the point of diminishing returns ?
One question leads to another one :  How are they going to pay this money back ? ’ the left side wants to know .
The more the left side thinks about it , the more it does n’t understand what is going on .
Let ’s see the biggest spendthrift on the planet issues trillions more in IOUs with no obvious way to pay back the money
and let ’s see this same spendthrift actually has the right to pay off its IOUs with more IOUs that it prints up itself .
and it actually WANTS to make its IOUs less valuable so that people wo n’t hold on to them .
It wants people to spend its IOUs on goods and services as fast as possible in order to get the economy moving again . 
 What am I missing here ? ’ asks the left side of the brain of no one in particular .
 The rest of the world has queued up to lend America as much money as it might wish to borrow in order to get its consumers to spend again ,  writes Spengler in the Asia Times .
 It wo n’t work , but that is another matter 
Spengler is a clever guy .
Unfortunately , many of his thoughts are unworthy of a clever man .
 A fearful world is buying trillions of dollars of securities from the US Treasury ,  he continues .
 Of all the cash flows in the world , nothing is more reliable than the tax revenues of the American state , the longest - lasting government on Earth presiding over the world ’s largest economy . 
Yes , and General Motors was the world ’s most successful automobile company — until it was n’t .
The fearful world is buying Treasuries , but not because the tax revenues of the American state are so reliable ; they ’re buying Treasuries because the United States is the only substantial debtor in the world that can make good on its debts with money of its own making .
Tax revenues in the United States are falling sharply .
Already , they ’re far short of what is necessary to cover America ’s public expenses .
That ’s why both Republican and Democratic administrations have run deficits — real deficits — since the Nixon administration .
And it ’s why the United States is now the largest Ponzi scheme in the world .
The only way to pay off the old lenders is to bring in new ones — or run the printing press .
That ’s all lenders have to worry about — inflation .
And for the moment , prices are going down .
They ’ll keep going down too — until they go up .
President Obama has come up with another plan — for $ 75 billion , he ’s going to try to prevent foreclosures .
It was determined a half century ago that home ownership was a good thing .
Since then , the government has bent the rules in favor of the homeowner — with artificially low mortgage rates and substantial tax benefits .
As an unforeseen consequence , the feds helped create the biggest mortgage - backed credit bubble in history .
Not only that , they changed the geography of America — with vast suburbs stretching out in all directions , rather than cheaper and more efficient tightly packed apartment buildings .
Now , Obama compounds the mistake
When he signed the $ 787 billion bailout bill on Tuesday , he warned the nation that we ’re not at the end of our troubles .
 Nor does it constitute all of what we are going to have to do to turn our economy around ,  he said .
 But today does mark the beginning of the end . ”
Maybe so .
But it feels like the beginning of the middle to us .
We ’ve had the initial shock .
We ’ve had a small rebound .
Now , we ’re ready for the second phase .
In this stage , we ought to have a better rebound but also another big leg down .
Stocks are still selling for 15 — 18 times earnings ( which are falling fast ) .
They need to get down to 5 — 8 times earnings .
That will bring the Dow down to around 5,000 , or lower .
This could take a long time .
We ’re in a depression , remember .
And in depressions economies need to be restructured , not just refreshed .
In the ’30s , none of the bailouts and stimulus packages of the Roosevelt Administration did any real good .
At the end of the decade , the economy was about where it was when the decade began — with 11 million people still unemployed .
And the poor Japanese have been waiting 19 years to get to the beginning of the end of their restructuring crisis .
They probably would have gotten to it years ago , were it not for the diligent efforts of Japanese politicians .
Instead of letting the banks fail , they bailed them out and propped them up .
Result : an on - again , off - again depression that has lasted longer than most marriages .
Our intrepid correspondent , Byron King , offers some more insight :
 Congress collects a lot of funds through taxes .
But not nearly enough to pay for all the spending .
It ’s not even close .
So will Congress raise taxes ?
And do it during a recession ?
I do n’t think so .
Herbert Hoover tried that in 1930 .
Did n’t work too well .
 What about the federal government borrowing ?
OK , it borrows a lot .
But can it borrow even more ?
Trillions of dollars ?
From whom ?
Who has an extra trillion dollars lying around that they want to loan the U.S. ?
Will China and the oil - exporting nations continue to buy up U.S. Treasury paper ?
If so , with what ?
Chinese exports are down .
Oil income is way down as well .
( Oil is selling at $ 34 per barrel today . )
So good luck with borrowing .
 That leaves the U.S. government with only one choice .
The U.S. is about to embark on the greatest currency - creating binge in modern history ( excluding that of Zimbabwe , perhaps ) .
A lot of that trillion dollars is going to come right out of nothing .
The Fed is just going to monetize the debt .
So we ’ll have new dollars chasing the same amount of goods .
That ’s the basic definition of inflation .
 The bottom line is you need to own precious metals .
Own gold .
How much ?
For now , the more , the better .
Own coins , if you can get ’em .
Own bullion , if you can get it .
Own shares in good mines with reserves in the ground while you can buy ’em .
Just get some gold .
On the other hand , our old friend Mark Hulbert notes that whenever investment advisors become this positive about gold the yellow metal usually goes down .
 Dad , this is the best house we ’ve ever had why would you want to sell it ? 
We were sitting on the verandah last night , having dinner .
Beneath us , the waves slapped against the rocks .
In front of us , a long , wide beach curved around toward green hills .
There are a few lights from the condominia in the distance .
Above them , the stars began to sparkle in the sky and the moon lit up the ocean like an old newsreel .
To bring you further into the picture , dear reader , this is a house that we built about five years ago .
At the time , we thought we might want to retire here .
Property prices were rising so rapidly , we saw little risk .
Besides , your editor can’t help himself .
Some men play golf ; he works on houses .
He ’s been at it for the last 40 years ; at this stage he ca n’t stop .
The house he built in Nicaragua is probably his best work .
He did n’t build it with his owns hands .
 That ’s probably why ,  his wife would say .
She is no fan of his handiwork .
As a carpenter , she thinks he makes a good plumber .
As a plumber , she would recommend him as an economist .
But with the help of a good architect and a good crew of workmen , the house went up and now is a delight .
It has aged gracefully and now looks like it has been here forever .
The idea was to build a new house on the beach that reflected the elegance and charm of Nicaragua ’s colonial past .
And so it does .
Columns , porches , arches , solid wood doors , shutters , cement tiles — all are recreated from elements found in Granada , one of the oldest cities in the country .
Unlike our other houses , this one is coherent .
The whole place was done in one style at one time with one design .
In France , for example , we have an old house , which was built , rebuilt , remodeled , expanded , reduced and redesigned a number of times over the centuries .
To the architectural variety we added our furniture moved over from Maryland ancestral portraits sideboards that belonged to our great - grandmothers and chairs found at a local junk shop .
We still have our house in Maryland too .
It is rented out to a carpenter .
We built it in the ’90s before we had enough money to build a proper house .
Your editor did much of the work himself — including the wood parquet that he made from trees on the farm .
 It shows ,  says Elizabeth .
It is not a bad house .
But it certainly would n’t be mistaken for an elegant one .
People get attached to houses .
That is why we have so many of them .
We ca n’t seem to sell them .
One is an architectural gem .
Another is where the children grew up .
Still another is our family home .
And the last of them we keep only because we ca n’t sell it ; like one of Elizabeth ’s broken - down horses , we keep it because no one else will take it .
But each house is a glutton .
It eats money .
Time .
Energy .
Attention .
Whoever thought houses would be good investments must not have known anything about investments .
Or houses .
Or women .
 Look ,  we said to Elizabeth , we ’ve got to get rid of these houses .
They ’re costing us money .
And in the spirit of the worldwide financial meltdown , we have to cut back . 
 Are you kidding ?
They ’re not worth that much .
Besides , the houses are solid .
They ’re not going away .
We enjoy them .
We can use them .
And we can leave them to our children .
Not like those gold mining stocks you bought or those Indian stocks ; they lost half their value in just a couple of weeks .
They could be worthless tomorrow , for all we know .
I ’d rather hold onto the houses and sell those stocks . 

This demonstrates a magnetic bearing , since the spinner floats on magnetic fields .
There is a Plexiglas wall at one end on which a steel point pushes against and minimizes the friction seen by the spinner .
There is some windage ( friction between the spinner and the air as it rotates ) but it will continue to spin for 3 or 4 minutes after you give it a good spin .
It is n't balanced real well so sometimes is wobbles as it slows down , but not too bad .
It also is great for your desk in the office .
See Patent # 5182533 .
This costs about $ 15 .

Levitron :
This is a great toy which is a real attention getter .
The spinning magnetic top will float above its base for about 3 minutes before it slows down too much and stops .
There are some great web sites which discuss the physics of this exhibit .
It does take some practice to get the top to spin smoothly , and it takes several tries to determine the proper amount of weight to place on the top so that it will just barely stay afloat .
If the top is too light , it will not stay on top of the magnetic field of the base .
If the top is too heavy , it will not float at all .
The way to make it work is to start the top spinning in the middle of the plastic plate while it is sitting on the base .
Then you gently lift the plastic plate , with the top still spinning on it , about 1 " upward , so that the top now finds a place in the air above the base where it will remain .
If things are not right , the top will fall to one side or another , like a ball rolling off of another ball .
To fix this , the base has to be tipped very slightly up on the side where the top falls off .
Another thing to keep in mind is that as it warms up ( due to room temperature changes or playing with it ) , some of the weights need to be removed for it to still be able to float .

Levitron Perpetuator :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d8FTadr03g
This is for the person who does not want to see his Levitron stop spinning and floating in mid-air .
It has an electromagnet in the base which keeps the top spinning indefinitely .
The power adapter is rated for 15.0 Vdc , 0.50A , with + on the inner pin , - on the outside .
It took a while to make mine work with my Super Levitron , and it will stay put for a max of about 15 minutes before something happens to make it fall off to the side .
It 's a bit tricky to set up .
Costs about $ 60 .

MagnaSwing :
This has 5 pendulums , very similar to a toy which uses five steel balls .
The difference is that each pendulum has a magnet in it , oriented so that they repel each other .
Start one swinging , and watch the others bounce around .
The motion continues for a long time since there is no energy lost in the collisions , and little energy lost in windage and friction on the wire supports .
This is a real nice toy !

The Magnaprobe holds a small alnico magnet in jeweled gimbals so that it can orient itself in any direction as needed .
The ball which looks like earth has a strong magnet inside of it .
Bringing the probe close to the earth causes the probe to swing around to point to the magnetic north or south pole as you move it over the surface of the earth .
Great way to teach how the magnetic field on the earth works .
Purchased from Arbor Scientific .

Magnetoids or Uber Orbs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kutfh35ca5g
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbGaSL6wJ8M
This is a new item in the stores today ( 2005 ) .
They are two magnets , made of ferrite , and polished to look like hematite .
They are magnetized so that one side is North and its opposite side is South .
That 's why the two are stuck together side - by - side as seen in the photo .
If you hold them apart about two inches in one hand and toss them into the air , they will be attracted to each other , bounce off of each other , and buzz as they vibrate .
If you have trouble catching them on the way down , stand over something soft like a bed or a carpeted floor so they wo n't smash into the concrete driveway and become hundreds of little pieces .
Cost is about $ 8 - $ 22 for the pair .
The photo on the right is a variation on the magnetoids .
The two spheres are polished ferrite magnets .
They will do the same thing when you toss them into the air about 1 - 2 inches apart .
They will make a neat buzzing sound when then are attracted to each other and bounce together .
They seem to work much better than the ellipsoids .
Do n't let them drop onto a hard floor !
Cost is about $ 5 .

Magnet Stones
I found some magnetized stones that looked like hematite but they would stick to each other !
I was at Wonderworks in Orlando , Florida when I spotted them .
You try to get as many into the bag for a single price .
I could get six into the bag .
Now , hematite cannot be permanently magnetized .
So , how do they do that ?
They are actually ferrite magnets ( the card that came with them called them ferric magnets ) that have been polished to look like hematite and then magnetized .
These can make the same buzzing sound like the Magnetoids .
I had heard about spheres of these that would stick together making a bracelet , too .
Available at TeacherSource for a cost of $ 7 for 30 .

They call them Sticky Stones .
Dipole Dilemma - Magnetic Puzzle
This is a fairly new puzzle made up of 28 spherical magnets and a rectangular form into which you need to place all of them .

This was a tricky one to solve .
It was designed by Chris Morgan - good job !
I found this at TeacherSource for about $ 35 .

Erotic humiliation is something that is tough to describe .
Some believe it is a form of abuse .
Others feel it is an erotic technique which adds another level to their interaction .
My belief is that it can fall into both categories depending upon the individuals involved .
The technique of erotic humiliation is the act of degrading a sub / slave either physically or verbally ( or both ) .
Many find this adds to the " separation " of power in therelationship .
The more one is put down , the higher the Other is elevated .
It is a method which many subs derive added pleasure and excitement .
However , there is a downside to all this .
If this is done with someone who is not able to handle it , the results can be devastating .
Many suffer psychological effects from abuse .
Those who do not deal with this situation can find erotic humiliation to be detrimental .
Instead of adding to a scene the outcome is more abuse .
Like anything else , communication is key .
It is imperative that two people sit down and discuss the effects of what is going to occur .
Is there something that one has a hangup about ?
Are there things in his / her past which could cause someone to " lose " it during the scene ?
These are issues which should be discussed .
Dominating is as much about psychological control as physical .
Anyone can physically dominate another as long as there is a size / strength difference .
Yet , controlling psychologically is another matter altogether .
It takes skill , awareness , and understanding .
In addition , it requires one to spend the necessary time learning about the sub so as to successfully navigate the scene .
Erotic humiliation is one technique that requires additional knowledge .
EconLog Book Club on For a New Liberty ?
By Bryan Caplan
Tyler ’s been having fun with his MR Book Club on Keynes ’ General Theory :
I will go through the book , chapter by chapter , with an eye toward a
deeper understanding of what Keynes wrote and why it is , as Greg says ,
so important .
Query :
Is there any interest in having an EconLog Book Club on Murray Rothbard ’s For a New Liberty ?
I ’ve got a lot of history with this book , which is now available online .
I read it about ten times between the years of 1989 and 1994 , and it had a tremendous influence on my thinking .
But I have n’t read it for fifteen years .
Now I ’m curious to revisit it and see how well it holds up .
Even if you find the anarcho - capitalist substance of the book noxious , it ’s hard not to admire the style .
For a New Liberty is ridiculously well - written , so whatever you conclude , you ’ll enjoy the book club experience .
Who ’s in ?
P.S. Glad to see there ’s so much interest .
I suggest we start discussing Chapter 1 , “ The Libertarian Heritage : The American Revolution and Classical Liberalism ” on January 20 .
P.P.S. Make sure you ’re reading the 1978 edition ( that ’s the one that ’s online ) .
For extra credit at the end , we can also talk about the original 1973 edition .

Economics as the dismal science ?
Not in some quarters .
In the midst of the deepest recession in the experience of most Americans , many professional forecasters are optimistically heading into the new year declaring that the worst may soon be over .
For this rosy picture to play out , they are counting on the Obama administration and Congress to come through with a substantial stimulus package , at least $ 675 billion over two years .
They say that will get the economy moving again in the face of persistently weak spending by consumers and businesses , not to mention banks that are reluctant to extend credit .
If the dominoes fall the right way , the economy should bottom out and start growing again in small steps by July , according to the December survey of 50 professional forecasters by Blue Chip Economic Indicators .
Investors seemed to be in a similarly optimistic mood on Friday , bidding up stocks by about 3 percent .

Main Features
Ubiquity 0.1.3 brings a range of new features to the board .
It includes an entirely new , simpler look , and the ability for anyone who knows CSS to create a Ubiquity skin .
The 0.1.3 release makes Ubiquity much faster and uses some of the same learning technology that makes the Awesome Bar in Firefox so smart .
New Look : Ubiquity has a new look that increases its visual simplicity and lays the groundwork for full keyboard access .

Relevancy : Ubiquity now makes it easier to get to the command you want .
It remembers the commands you use — just like the Awesome Bar — as well as matching anywhere in a command name .
Deprecated and Backwards - incompatible Changes
A few backwards - incompatible changes were made in 0.1.3 :
As a result of fixing 146 — making it possible for Ubiquity subscriptions to outlive browsing history — your Ubiquity subscriptions are now stored in a different place , and as a result , your subscriptions will be cleared to their defaults .
Fortunately , there 's a command feed migration page you can access at chrome://ubiquity / content/annotation_migration.html .
As explained ( and diagrammed ! ) in Atul 's blog post entitled Ubiquity 0.1.3 Preview : Faster , Prettier , the internal architecture of Ubiquity has been enhanced for some performance - critical speedups such that the global window object in command feeds is now deprecated .
While command feeds can still use it , the actual underlying behavior is n't guaranteed to be the same , and a deprecation warning will be logged to the JS console .
Instead of using this global , command feeds should use context .
window from now on .
Download It
If you already have Ubiquity , it will automatically update itself soon ( you can also go to the add- ons manager and click " Find Updates " if you are feeling impatient ) .
If you do n't already have Ubiquity installed , you can get the latest version here .
Thanks
Over ten people contributed to the code found in Ubiquity 0.1.3 .
There way more thanks that should be given than can be expressed here .
We did , however , want to call out two folks in particular for their work on envisioning and creating the skinning functionality : Yatrik Solanki and Abimanyu Raja .
We 'd also like to thank Zach Lym for his ongoing work on Ubiquity user testing .
Finally , we 'd like to extend a welcome to Christian Sonne , who has joined the group of core contributors .
You can find him , and the rest of us on #ubiquity on irc.mozilla.org .

Developer - facing changes :
I 'm not sure most people grasp the sheer scale of the current crisis .
This may help .
First , there is the shadow banking system ( see the estimate of its size below relative to other big things ... ) .
NOTE , estimates can be even much larger than this .
In short , it 's the massive pile of derivatives accumulated over the past decades .
It 's also tightly coupled and extremely complex ( worse , not understood ) .
It is n't regulated , nor is it liquid enough to price ( which is why global banks are still able to " act " like they are solvent ) .
Granted , this is the notional value rather than market value , but in uncertain times market values and notional values can converge .
The best way to view the shadow banking system is as a financial amplification system .
A byproduct of its operation is that it can take small financial events and convert them into financial nuclear weapons that explode with a spectacular display and devastating effect .
Worse , since the entire global economic system is deeply turbulent , we can expect to see more financial nuclear explosions than ever before as the shadow banking system amplifies an increasing number of small and unexpected events into disasters .
Next , there is the global economy .
Finally , there is the US economy .
You can see why global banks are now trading at prices that anticipate insolvency and government bailout ( See this chart from JP Morgan for more ) .
And why the UK looks like Iceland more each day .
NOTE : fixed the circles .
Scientists have found the first unequivocal evidence that the Arctic region is warming at a faster rate than the rest of the world at least a decade before it was predicted to happen .
Climate - change researchers have found that air temperatures in the region are higher than would be normally expected during the autumn because the increased melting of the summer Arctic sea ice is accumulating heat in the ocean .
The phenomenon , known as Arctic amplification , was not expected to be seen for at least another 10 or 15 years and the findings will further raise concerns that the Arctic has already passed the climatic tipping - point towards ice - free summers , beyond which it may not recover .
The Arctic is considered one of the most sensitive regions in terms of climate change and its transition to another climatic state will have a direct impact on other parts of the northern hemisphere , as well more indirect effects around the world .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Although researchers have documented a catastrophic loss of sea ice during the summer months over the past 20 years , they have not until now detected the definitive temperature signal that they could link with greenhouse - gas emissions .
However , in a study to be presented later today to the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco , scientists will show that Arctic amplification has been under way for the past five years , and it will continue to intensify Arctic warming for the foreseeable future .
Computer models of the global climate have for years suggested the Arctic will warm at a faster rate than the rest of the world due to Arctic amplification but many scientists believed this effect would only become measurable in the coming decades .
However , a study by scientists from the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre ( NSIDC ) in Colorado has found that amplification is already showing up as a marked increase in surface air temperatures within the Arctic region during the autumn period , when the sea ice begins to reform after the summer melting period .
Julienne Stroeve , of the NSIDC , who led the study with her colleague Mark Serreze , said that autumn air temperatures this year and in recent years have been anomalously high .
The Arctic Ocean warmed more than usual because heat from the sun was absorbed more easily by the dark areas of open water compared to the highly reflective surface of a frozen sea .
" Autumn 2008 saw very strong surface temperature anomalies over the areas where the sea ice was lost , " Dr Stroeve told The Independent ahead of her presentation today .
" The observed autumn warming that we 've seen over the Arctic Ocean , not just this year but over the past five years or so , represents Arctic amplification , the notion that rises in surface air temperatures in response to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will be larger in the Arctic than elsewhere over the globe , " she said .
" The warming climate is leading to more open water in the Arctic Ocean .
As these open water areas develop through spring and summer , they absorb most of the sun 's energy , leading to ocean warming .
" In autumn , as the sun sets in the Arctic , most of the heat that was gained in the ocean during summer is released back to the atmosphere , acting to warm the atmosphere .
It is this heat - release back to the atmosphere that gives us Arctic amplification . "
Temperature readings for this October were significantly higher than normal across the entire Arctic region – between 3C and 5C above average – but some areas were dramatically higher .
In the Beaufort Sea , north of Alaska , for instance , near - surface air temperatures were more than 7C higher than normal for this time of year .
The scientists believe the only reasonable explanation for such high autumn readings is that the ocean heat accumulated during the summer because of the loss of sea ice is being released back into the atmosphere from the sea before winter sea ice has chance to reform .
" One of the reasons we focus on Arctic amplification is that it is a good test of greenhouse warming theory .
Even our earliest climate models were telling us that we should see this Arctic amplification emerge as we lose the summer ice cover , " Dr Stroeve said .
" This is exactly what we are not starting to see in the observations .
Simply put , it 's a case of we hate to say we told you so , but we did , " she added .
Computer models have also predicted totally ice - free summers in the Arctic by 2070 , but many scientists now believe that the first ice - free summer could occur far earlier than this , perhaps within the next 20 years .
