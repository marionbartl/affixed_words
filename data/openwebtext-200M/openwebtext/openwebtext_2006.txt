Everybody knows that cats have nine lives .
But one very special and much loved cat has been born with TWO faces - and very possibly , two brains .
The owner of the tomcat called Lil' Bit - as in ' A little bit of love ' - nearly dropped the kitten in shock when its extra features were revealed .
But the 47 - year old woman owner from Arizona , USA , was determined that the odd arrival , although ill , should not be put to sleep and she pledged to become Lil ' Bit 's carer .

Now , seven months later , after feeding the mog from a pipette on baby milk and eventually more solid food , he is apparently thriving and seems likely to live to a grand old age .
Lil'Bit had four eyes when he was born , although the two middle eyes are on the point of merging , two mouths ,
two noses , but just two ears .
And vets believe the cat may actually have two brains as one face can go to sleep while the other remains awake .
If Lil 'Bit gets a cold , the nose on only one of her faces will run .
Lil'Bit was one of five kittens born in a litter from his mum , Lil'Pine , seven months ago .
His two brothers and two sisters only had the regulation one face .

The cat 's owner , who wishes to remain anonymous as she believes unwanted callers to her home to see the cat may leave Lil ' Bit stressed and ill , told how she discovered the puss with two faces .
She said yesterday : ' The kittens were born underneath my computer table .
When I picked Lil' Bit up I suddenly spotted that he had two faces .
I was so shocked that I nearly dropped him .
' I called a kitten rescue service and they told me not to expect him to survive .
But I did n't see why he should n't be given the chance to live .
Everything is possible .
' I got him a heating pad and started feeding him every 15 minutes from an eye - dropper .
I fed him like that for two or three months before starting him on proper cat food .
' He finds it hard to walk normally so there was a litter problem because he could n't do it himself .
So I hit on the idea of using premature baby diapers on him .
It seems to work well .
' The amazing thing to watch is that one of Lil ' Bit 's faces can be asleep while the other one is awake .
I have also seen him sneeze out of one side and not the other and blink on one side of his face but not the other .
' And when he purrs it is like he is purring in stereo .
' We have n't had any X - rays done or operations under anaesthesia because I think that could upset Lil' Bit .
But the vet seems to think there is a good chance there are two brains operating here .
It seems logical as she breathes out of both mouths and noses .
The mother of two boys added : ' The whole family loves Lil' Bit . '
WASHINGTON , Dec. 6  Investors in real estate partnerships evade billions of dollars in federal taxes each year , even though detecting this type of cheating is easy , a former specialist in partnerships for the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday .
The states , especially New York , also lose vast sums , according to the specialist , Jerry Curnutt , who retired from the tax agency in 2000 .
Mr. Curnutt , who now works from his home in Arlington , Tex. , said that a statistical report released by the I.R.S. last week indicated that cheating on the reporting of real estate partnership gains was growing sharply .
“ Nationally , in 2005 , at least $ 20 billion of gain from real estate tax shelters was unreported , ” he said , “ and in New York State , the epicenter of the business , the figure may be as high as $ 5 billion . ”
The Wii AK - 47 Controller Mod
Take an icon of the Soviet Union ( the AK - 47 ) and a Shemagh ( as currently used by the military in the desert ) .
Some of the least likely things to go with a Wii , right ?
What This Is Nintendo's Wii , in case you did n't know , is a video game system with motion sensitive controls .
The controls consist of a nunchuck ( handheld unit with a thumb - joystick ) and the wiimote ( which is a wand - like controller used to point at the screen .
Both are button - laden and motion sensitive .
I took a plastic AK - 47 and removed the insides , then repackaged and rewired as necessary to move the wiimote IR - sensor into the muzzle and wire up the trigger with a switch .
Also , the nunchuck was mounted like a vertical grip so it can be easily grasped and used .
This allows the AK to function much like the Wii Zapper , in that gun-like aiming can be done and the motion sensing is still intact .
However , unlike the zapper , the AK - 47 is much much funnier .
After all , the Soviet Union and contemporary desert conflict are probably some of the least likely things to be mated to the otherwise wholesome and popular Wii ( unless somebody out there has made a toilet - plunger mod , or something . )
For the record , to me the AK - 47 says " Soviet Union " and a Shemagh says " Article of clothing , not political statement " .
They both have obtained other connotations , though .
But I do n't have anything to say about that end of things .
Why Bother ?
I made this partly to see if it would offer improved control in games .
I suppose it does offer some amount of improved control , but mostly it 's just for fun .
I mainly made this just for the experience of using an AK rifle butt to smack the choirists singing out of tune in Rayman Raving Rabbids .
Actually , that 's pretty much the only reason I made it .
( Normally you 'd point at the rabbid in question with the wiimote , and then " slap " them by waving the nunchuck .
Now you can point the AK at them , and swing the AK around to rifle - butt them instead . )
Design Details
Fundamentally we are doing two electrical things - the rest is cosmetic : 1 : we are extending out some wires attached to the contacts for the " B " button ( and I would recommend also the " A " ) - these will attach to switches to be used as triggers .
2 : the IR camera on the front of the wiimote will be removed and re-mounted remotely .
So , we 'll need a lot of suitably thin cables and the ability to solder small connections .
The cosmetic parts consist of mounting the nunchuk somewhere comfortable , and mounting the other parts into and onto a body or shell .
I used a plastic , mostly hollow AK - 47 .
There 's no reason you could n't use something else ; perhaps even a glove of some sort .
Construction Details
First , the wiimote needs to be disassembled - you will need a special Nintendo screwdriver for this .
One source for them is a place like DealExtreme .
The black component at the front is the IR sensor / camera .
It needs to be removed , so de-solder it carefully .
Save the black plastic in front of the sensor .
It helps shield the camera from ambient light and should be replaced in front of the camera wherever you decide to mount it .
After removal , wires should be carefully soldered to the camera , and the other ends soldered to the matching holes on the wiimote circuitboard .
Afterwards would be a good time to make sure the wiimote still works .
If not , make sure you have no solder bridges or wiring errors .
The other thing that needs doing is to locate the contacts for the " A " and " B " buttons and attach small , thin wires to them so that they can be attached to remote switches , which will serve as triggers .
The image shows the " B " button 's wiring .
The " A " button is on the opposite side of the wiimote and should also be done .
If you use suitably thin wire ( like wire - wrap wire ) the wire should be flush enough so that it does n't interfere with the button operation , allowing the A and B buttons on the wiimote to continue to function normally .
This would be a good time to fire the Wii up again and make sure the controller still works .
The " A " and " B " buttons should be triggered by touching their respective wires together momentarily .
Now all that 's left is to attach some switches to the A and B button wires , and fit those switches and controller guts ( or the entire controller , if there is room ) into whatever you want .
Packing it into the AK shell
Here are some pictures showing how I did the final assembly for my Wii AK - 47 .
The IR camera ( with the black plastic IR shield replaced in front of the camera ) went onto the muzzle .
The camera was too large to fit inside the AK 's actual muzzle opening , so I made a small enclosure to hold it securely .
The switch for the main trigger gets attached to the wiimote " B " button .
A smaller , secondary trigger switch was installed for the less - used " A " button .
The nunchuck was left intact , but I made a moulded holder for it out of sintra ( PVC foam board ) .
The board was cut to shape and heated with a heat gun until soft , then moulded around the nunchuk .
After the sharp edges were trimmed , a spot of hot glue holds it snug , and the whole thing was hot - glued to the AK 's handguard .
This allows the nunchuk to be held like a vertical grip , is n't TOO much of an eyesore , and keeps the nunchuk 100 % functional .
Some Technical Issues / Lessons Learned
A number of issues came up while making and using the Wii AK - 47 .
Games are not consistent with whether they use the A button ( top of the wiimote ) or the B button ( bottom of wiimote ) as the " trigger " .
For example , Rayman Raving Rabbids likes to use the " A " button a lot but Link 's Crossbow Training uses the " B " button .
This means that if you want flexibility , you either need two triggers ( one for A and one for B ) or some means of switching between the two .
I made two triggers .
Playing on a projector or other large screen means that the wiimote 's " mouse pointer " will not always line up with the sights .
The pointer is not always exactly where you are actually aiming , rifle - wise .
It 's best to play on a normal sized TV .
( There might be a way to solve this - I have experimented with adjusting the width of the sensor bar but no luck yet . )
UPDATE : After more testing , even on smaller screens the Wiimote is clearly not a 1 - to - 1 movement device .
Near the middle of the screen the " pointer " may line up with the rifle sights , but the closer you get to the sides and edges of the screen , the less the pointer is lined up with the sights .
This is a fundamental thing , it 's just more noticeable when used on larger screens .
Bottom line :
It is impossible to have the gun " sighted in " to match up with the wiimote pointer no matter how you adjust it .
Without the ability to use the rifle sights reliably , it 's just a novelty because you 're always stuck with shooting from the hip .
Bonus : How to Tie a Shemagh
If you have a shemagh lying around ( they really are very useful pieces of clothing , suitable for both hot or cold weather ) putting it on can help complete your AK 's look in a campy way .
Even if you 're not going to use it with your Wii AK - 47 , it can still be useful to know how to tie one :

Here is some footage of the Wii AK - 47 in use .
The video also includes " How to Tie a Shemagh " .
And while on the subject of toy guns , you may want to take a quick look at How to Make Sonic Grenades !
Hey , while you 're reading about video game - related projects , why do n't you take a look at the Real - life version of the HALO multiplayer skull from Oddball ?
Sometimes you just ca n’t be neutral .
That , apparently , is the reasoning behind Comcast ’s recently revealed actions regarding several peer - to - peer applications , including BitTorrent .
In case you have n’t been following the story , here ’s a quick rundown .
It started five days ago when the Associated Press ran a story called “ Comcast Blocks Some Internet Traffic . ”
In this story , the reporter , Peter Svensson , points out that Comcast was blocking P2P traffic by interfering with certain packet streams .
Each PC gets a message invisible to the user that looks like it comes from the other computer , telling it to stop communicating .
But neither message originated from the other computer — it comes from Comcast .
If it were a telephone conversation , it would be like the operator breaking into the conversation , telling each talker in the voice of the other : “ Sorry , I have to hang up .
Good bye . ”
This may have never been major news except for two things :
First , back in August , Comcast denied that it was doing this exact thing , Second , Ubuntu 7.10 , Gutsy Gibbon , was released six days ago .
And when the # 1 Linux distribution in America is released , you can bet your sweet bippy that the FTP mirrors for it will get hammered , leading people to consider using BitTorrent to get it .
Comcast users had problems getting Gutsy .
Svensson would go on to explain exactly how the tests were conducted and how Comcast was specifically blocking the traffic in a follow - up article .
They used a copy of the ( public domain ) King James Bible and tried to download it to , and from , Comcast subscribers via the BitTorrent protocol .
In two out of three tries , the transfer was blocked .
In the third , the transfer started only after a 10 - minute delay .
According to Svensson , what was happening was that Comcast was inserting RST ( Reset ) packets into the communication – but forging the address to make it look like it was coming from either the sender ’s or recipient ’s computer .
Packet capture and analysis showed that neither computer was sending these RST packets .
It was originating from the middle – from Comcast .
Furthermore , they tested via a Time Warner Cable connection and found that Comcast was sending these reset packets to subscribers to other networks as well .
Peter Eckersley of the Electronic Frontier Foundation then got into the action with an investigation of his own , showing that the same thing happens when you use a Gnutella P2P node , or , even , as Kevin Kanarski found out , when you use IBM ’s Lotus Notes with Domino .
As you can see from these traces , the Notes client saw the RST packets coming from the Domino server IP and the Domino server saw the RST packets coming from the Notes client PC .
However the trace does n’t show either one of them sending the RST packets which means something on the network in between was sending them .
At this point , the story blows up and is all around the Web – with many different angles to it .
The first angle I want to look at is the angle of quality of service and the end - user experience .
In a prepared statement , Comcast representative Charlie Douglas said that : “ Comcast does not block access to any Web sites or online applications , including peer - to - peer activity like BitTorrent . ”
The AP test seems to prove that statement inaccurate – or at least , imply that Comcast is playing a very slick semantic game with the meaning of “ block . ”
Some BT data is being blocked .
Some BT data is n’t .
What are accurate things to say is that Comcast is interfering in access to BitTorrent .
It would also be accurate to say that Comcast is intentionally degrading the quality of service to BitTorrent .
This is important because all defenses of Comcast begin and end with the idea that if Comcast does degrade BitTorrent traffic , it does so out of altruistic goals to serve all of its subscribers .
Or , as Comcast put it in a statement , “ We have a responsibility to provide all of our customers with a good Internet experience and we use the latest technologies to manage our network so that they can continue to enjoy these applications . ”
But clearly , for BitTorrent ( and IBM Lotus Notes users ) the end - user experience is being worsened .
Does that mean everyone else ’s access is being improved ?
Not very likely .
See , BitTorrent gets lumped in with Napster as a peer - to - peer tool , but it does so unfairly , in my opinion .
BitTorrent is , ultimately a tool used to improve the quality of service and , in its own way , improve network performance .
On the client end , it improves the quality of service through faster downloads .
On the server end , it improves the quality of service through reduced bandwidth requirements .
But Comcast , according to the AP , degraded the performance of BitTorrent and then expressly said that they were n’t .
That can cause end -users to think that BitTorrent is an unreliable application .
The end - user then prefers more traditional methods of downloading large files – FTP , IRC , UseNet , etc .
These methods take up more overall bandwidth than BitTorrent would have .
In such a manner , Comcast ’s blocking of BitTorrent degrades quality of service for the Internet as a whole .
Here ’s another angle :
If the claims made by the Associated Press are true , Comcast is not only sending these reset packets without disclosing so to customers , but also that these RST packets look like they ’re coming from “ spoofed ” or “ forged ” IP addresses – the sender thinks these packets are coming from the receiver , and the receiver thinks these packets are coming from the sender .
However , as studies by the AP and others have shown , they ’re coming from neither – or more bluntly , they ’re coming from Comcast .
These forged IP addresses can complicate the troubleshooting and delay mean time to repair of networking problems .
Quite frankly , because Comcast is allegedly sending out false information , the engineers do n’t have the information they need to solve problems .
You can only imagine the frustration of a network engineer , called up by an irate C - level executive , who wants to know why Lotus Notes is n’t responding when he tries to access the server from home .
The engineer tests the packets and finds that the executive ’s computer is sending out excessive reset packets .
The engineer then goes out to check on the executive ’s computer , only to find that the server is now sending out the packets .
Now the engineer can call in IBM , but they wo n’t know what ’s going on , only that some users are reporting excessive reset packets .
The company might go so far as to dump Lotus Notes and go with a different solution – which means IBM has lost money .
It gets worse .
Forged IP addresses are essentially “ impersonating ” another person ’s computer .
If Comcast did this while denying it was doing so , it can also be argued that this “ impersonation ” was an attempt to “ defraud . ”
Even if Comcast gets explicit permission to do exactly this in Comcast subscribers ’ terms of service , they do not get the permission of people on other networks , accessing a Comcast subscriber ’s computer in a P2P session .
Further complicating this is the fact that BitTorrent , Inc. , the company whose founder invented BitTorrent , has recently gotten distribution deals which allow BitTorrent , Inc. , to sell legal downloads of television shows online .
These are the same television shows that are also available via Comcast ’s cable television service .
That may make Comcast ’s alleged throttling of BitTorrent traffic at best a conflict of interest , at worst , “ anti-competitive behavior . ”
We ’re not lawyers , but we ’re pretty sure these issues could put Comcast in legal hot water .
Even if not , it is a major customer service problem from a company notorious for bad customer service .
Comcast is the cable company in the YouTube video where the cable installer spent so much time on hold that he ended up falling asleep on the customer ’s couch .
Comcast also , as far back as 2003 , was threatening to disconnect – and followed through on disconnecting – customers who used “ too much ” bandwidth on an Unlimited Bandwidth plan , while refusing to disclose where , exactly , the bandwidth cap lies , and gallingly insisting that there was no bandwidth cap .
In fact , a 75 year old woman walked into a Comcast branch office , started smashing stuff with a claw hammer , and the Washington Post began the story with the lede :
“ Sometimes truly American virtues arise in outlaws who — by dint of heroic but questionable endeavors — display the mettle of the national character . ”
This customer service problem is so great that Advertising Age said that Comcast should spend less money on advertising in order to improve its customer service .
When the trade magazine for the advertising industry tells you that you need to do less advertising , and one of its major columnists declares a “ Consumer Jihad ” and titles the article , “ Comcast Must Die ” you ’ve got a major problem .
Journalistic ethics also demand that a reporter try to get all sides of the story , and you ’ll have noticed thus far that we ’ve not shown Comcast ’s side .
However , the Comcast representative I spoke to was only willing to answer questions “ on background . ”
This is how someone at Comcast spoke to the New York Times , and apparently , the New York Times has no problem with that arrangement .
But , I do n’t believe that Comcast reps should be speaking on background .
“ On background , ” I reserve for people who could lose jobs or face physical harm for whistleblowing and talking about something that is of vital information .
I could n’t think of any reason a Comcast representative could n’t talk about Comcast ’s policies on the record .
That ’s why there ’s nobody from Comcast telling their side of the story in this article .
Sometimes you just ca n’t be neutral .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military said on Monday it had killed 60 militants during a week - long offensive in northern Iraq against al Qaeda which has proved a resilient foe and has resisted previous attempts to drive it from the region .

The offensive in four northern provinces and Baghdad ’s southern suburbs was launched on January 8 by the U.S. military , which regards al Qaeda as the single greatest threat to Iraq ’s security and has blamed it for an upsurge in suicide bombings .
In Baghdad , gunmen killed appeals court judge Amir Jawdat al - Naeib as he drove to work on Monday .
Naeib ’s driver was also killed .
Militants have frequently targeted judges , academics , other professionals and their families .
The new offensive is seen as part of the U.S. strategy of reducing violence to give Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s government time to cement the security gains with political progress towards national reconciliation .
The military said in a statement that U.S. and Iraqi forces had killed 60 militants , detained 193 and found 79 weapons caches containing thousands of rounds of ammunition , explosives and home - made bombs during the offensive in northern Iraq .
Troops had found one cache in an underground bunker complex with several rooms during operations in Diyala , a volatile , religiously mixed province north of Baghdad .
But the fighting has not been one - sided .
Police said seven policemen were killed when the house they were searching blew up in the town of Buhriz just south of Baquba , Diyala ’s capital .
Six U.S. soldiers were killed in Diyala last week when a house booby - trapped with explosives collapsed on top of them .
It was the single greatest loss of life by U.S. troops so far during the operation .
A similar offensive targeting al Qaeda in Diyala last summer failed to drive out the Sunni Islamist group because many militants escaped before the well - flagged operation .
A series of U.S. and Iraqi operations against al Qaeda in the second half of 2007 largely drove the group from the capital and western Anbar province , and they are now regrouping in the north , U.S. officials say .
POWER CUTS
While overall levels of violence in Iraq have dropped by about 60 percent since last June , suicide bombings have surged in Iraq ’s northern provinces since December , killing dozens .
Progress towards reconciliation has been slow and many Iraqis complain that while security has improved , the government is still failing to provide water and electricity .
Faced with a particularly cold winter , Iraqis are struggling with the absence of such basic services in some areas .
Parts of Iraq have been hit by power cuts .
In the capital and in the northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk , residents say they only have one or two hours of electricity a day .
The Electricity Ministry on Monday blamed Turkey for cutting power to the northern Kurdish provinces of Dahuk and Arbil and Kuwait for halting supplies of fuel to electricity stations in the south .
It also said some power lines had been sabotaged .
ALL IRAQIS
Washington is anxious that Maliki ’s government begins to show it serves all Iraqis , not just the Shi’ite and Kurdish communities whose political blocs dominate his administration .
Iraq ’s main Sunni Arab bloc said on Monday it was ready to return to Maliki ’s cabinet in an effort to revive the national unity government that collapsed last year .
Sunni Arab Vice President Tareq al - Hashemi , leader of the largest political party in the Accordance Front , appeared to signal a new readiness to strike a deal after parliament on Saturday voted to allow members of Saddam Hussein ’s Baath party to return to government jobs , a long - time Sunni Arab demand .
“ We believe that the interests of Iraq needs us to return , not only the Accordance Front , but the other blocs and parties that withdrew from government , ” said Hashemi .
Hashemi said there was an urgent need to end what he called the “ unprecedented stagnation ” of the political process .

Last week another pre-approved credit card application form arrived in the mail , from American Express .
It was called Blue Sky .
In the business world , blue sky is a term used for potential , goodwill and hot air .
This card was aptly named .
No annual card fee !
Use Blue Sky points to fly 365 days a year !
Fly for 50 per cent fewer points !
A few days later I received an email from Qantas headed " 1000 extra points with hotels on qantas.com " .
Who do they think they are kidding ?
Banks , credit card companies , airlines and retailers are generating millions of frequent flyer miles as incentives but they are doing so in the full knowledge they are making promises that can not be kept .
Too many miles are chasing too few available seats and everyone knows it .
The whole system is built on the knowledge that a large proportion of those miles , at least 20 per cent , will never be redeemed .
The entire frequent flyer edifice , now worth billions to the airlines , is part incentive and part con job .
Let us begin with an example which is both common and about which I can speak with complete authority .
I am a Qantas frequent flyer .
I have Silver status .
I belong to the Qantas Club .
I have enough miles accumulated to fly anywhere Qantas flies .
In theory .

The UK must be careful how it tackles terrorism and treats Islamic culture if it is to avoid recreating a society reminiscent of Nazi Germany , the head of the Muslim Council of Britain has warned .
Muhammad Abdul Bari , in an interview with the Daily Telegraph , criticised the Government for fuelling tensions in the Muslim community rather than dissipating them .
He told the paper : " There is a disproportionate amount of discussion surrounding us .
The air is thick with suspicion and unease .
It is not good for the Muslim community , it is not good for society . "
The Muslim leader added : " Every society has to be really careful so that situation does not lead us to a time when people 's minds can be poisoned as they were in the 1930s .
" If your community is perceived in a very negative manner and poll after poll says that we are alienated then Muslims begin to feel very vulnerable .
" We are seen as creating problems , not as bringing anything , and that is not good for society . "
The Government 's foreign policy and particularly the Iraq war , which he described as a " disaster " , had been used by criminals as a weapon to encourage young people into extremism , he said .
Dr Bari also criticised the head of MI5 , Jonathan Evans , for painting a bleak picture of the terrorist threat the night before the Queen 's Speech this week .
He said : " I do n't think it was a good thing to share information in this way , I think it is creating a scare in the community and wider society .
It probably helps some people who try to recruit the young to terrorism . "
The leader believes integration should be a two - way process and that the emphasis should be on the positive aspects of Muslim culture instead of the threat of al Qaida .
Muslim principles - including stricter attitudes to drinking , sex , marriage , abortion and dress - could improve the country as a whole and add more morality , he argues .
Dr Bari said : " Marriage should not be forced on people but parents can be a catalyst ...
Young people are emotional , they want idealism .
Older people have gone through all sorts of things and become a bit more experienced . "
And he advocated no sex before marriage , saying " on adultery and living together , we should try to go back to the history - old , religiously - informed style of life that helps society " .
Homosexuality was , he said , " unacceptable from the religious point of view " .
Children and young people should be encouraged to dress more modestly , he argues .
" You should n't be revealing your body so much that it can be tempting to other people .
" I hope my daughter would n't wear a bikini but I also hope she would n't wear a burka .
Islam does n't prescribe the type of dress , it just says you have to be modest .
There should be social discussion about this . "
MI5 chief Mr Evans said on Monday that there were at least 2,000 people in the UK who pose a threat to national security because of their support for terrorism .

Credit Card Strategies For A Stress Free Vacation
How can you enjoy your vacation when you have no money to spend ?
It ’s kind of hard to do since most trips involve spending money on food , lodging , travel , gifts , etc .
On most vacations , no money means no fun !
Credit Instead of Cash
On the second day of our recent trip I had a panic attack when I could n’t find my wallet .
Luckily , I was n’t carrying much cash because I had brought along credit cards to cover our expenses .
If you lose cash its money down the drain but if you lose your credit card you ’re not out any money .
Even if someone else finds your card goes on a spending spree the credit card company wo n’t hold you responsible for the charges if you report the card lost or stolen .
One thing to keep in mind for an international trip is that some credit card companies charge extra fees if you use your credit card in a country outside of the US .
For example American Express charges a 2 % fee of the purchase price of anything you buy internationally .
Carry a Backup Card
If you do lose your credit card you ’ll feel much better if you have a backup .
Do n’t keep both cards in the same place , I gave our Chase Visa to my wife and kept the American Express Blue Cash in my wallet so if one of us lost our bag we ’d still have the other card as backup .
Another reason to carry a backup is in case one of your cards reaches its limit .
On our honeymoon , the hotel put a hold for almost $ 1000 on our primary card as a deposit , even though we ’d already paid for the room .
I did n’t know about the charge until one night at dinner when my card was declined because the dinner bill would put us over our credit limit .
Luckily we had a backup card otherwise we ’d have been washing dishes to pay for dinner , not very romantic .
Use a Rewards Card
Why not earn cash back , airline miles , or hotel points for your next vacation while you ’re enjoying this one ?
There are specific hotel cards for Hilton & Marriott and airline cards for United , Delta , American Airlines , and US Airways .
Or there are more generic cards such as American Express Blue Sky , Chase Travel Plus Platinum , and Citi Premier Pass whose rewards points you can use on a variety of hotels , airlines , and car rentals .
Using a rewards card can help you prepare financially for your next trip while you ’re relaxing on the current one .
Be Card Smart
Of course credit cards do bring the temptation to spend more on your trip because it ’s easy to charge it now and worry about the payments later .
If you can avoid this mental trap then using these credit card strategies can help you spend less time worrying about paying for your fun and more time enjoying it !
TSA Misses the Point , Again
They ’re checking IDs more carefully , looking for forgeries :
Black lights will help screeners inspect the ID cards by illuminating holograms , typically of government seals , that are found in licenses and passports .
Screeners also are getting magnifying glasses that highlight tiny inscriptions found in borders of passports and other IDs .
About 2,100 of each are going to the nation ’s 800 airport checkpoints .
The closer scrutiny of passenger IDs is the latest Transportation Security Administration effort to check passengers more thoroughly than simply having them walk through metal detectors . [… ]
More than 40 passengers have been arrested since June in cases when TSA screeners spotted altered passports , fraudulent visas and resident ID cards , and forged driver ’s licenses .
Many of them were arrested on immigration charges .
ID checks have nothing to do with airport security .
And even if they did , anyone can fly on a fake ID .
And enforcing immigration laws is not what the TSA does .
In related news , look at this page from the TSA ’s website :
We screen every passenger ; we screen every bag so that your memories are from where you went , not how you got there .
We ’re here to help your travel plans be smooth and stress free .
Please take a moment to become familiar with some of our security measures .
Doing so now will help save you time once you arrive at the airport .
I know they do n’t mean it that way , but does n’t it sound like it ’s saying “ We know it does n’t help , but it might make you feel better ” ?
And why is this even news ?
So Jason — looking every bit the middle - aged man on an uneventful trip to anywhere — shows a boarding pass and an ID to a TSA document checker , and he is directed to a checkpoint where , unbeknown to the security officer on site , the real test begins .
He gets through , which in real life would mean a terrorist was headed toward a plane with a bomb .
To be clear , the TSA allowed CNN to see and record this test , and the agency is not concerned with CNN showing it .
The TSA says techniques such as the one used in Tampa are known to terrorists and openly discussed on known terror Web sites .
Also relevant : “ Confessions of a TSA Agent “ :
The traveling public has no idea that the changes the TSA makes come as orders sent down directly from Washington D.C.
Those orders may have reasons , but we little screeners at a screening checkpoint will never be told what the background might be .
We get told to do something , and just as in the military , we are expected to make it happen — no ifs , ands or buts about it .
Perhaps the changes are as a result of some event occurring in the nation or the world , perhaps it ’s based on some newly received information or interrogation .
What the traveling public needs to understand the necessity for flexibility .
If a passenger asks us why we ’re doing something , in all likelihood we could n’t tell them even if we really did know the answer .
This is a business of sensitive information that is used to make choices that can have life changing effects if the information is divulged to the wrong person (s ) .
Just trust that we must know something that prompts us to be doing something .
I have no idea why Kip Hawley is surprised that the TSA is as unpopular with Americans as the IRS .

This explores the idea of distilling a whole film down to one single image .
Using eight of my favourite films from eight of my most admired directors including Sidney Lumet , Francis Ford Coppola and John Boorman , each film is processed through a Java program written with the processing environment .
This small piece of software samples a movie every second and generates an 8 x 6 pixel image of the frame at that moment in time .
It does this for the entire film , with each row representing one minute of film time .
The end result is a kind of unique fingerprint for that film .
A sort of movie DNA showing the colour hues as well as the rhythm of the editing process .
Compare Serpico to The Conversation .
You can see there 's far more edits in Lumet 's classic compared to the more gentle slower pace of Coppola 's Conversation .
This is also down to the editing style of Walter Murch who prefers to only make cuts when absolutely necessary .
Have a look through the eight movies and make your own mind up .

Software developers do n’t really like to make schedules .
Usually , they try to get away without one .
“ It ’ll be done when it ’s done ! ” they say , expecting that such a brave , funny zinger will reduce their boss to a fit of giggles , and in the ensuing joviality , the schedule will be forgotten .
Most of the schedules you do see are halfhearted attempts .
They ’re stored on a file share somewhere and completely forgotten .
When these teams ship , two years late , that weird guy with the file cabinet in his office brings the old printout to the post mortem , and everyone has a good laugh .
“ Hey look !
We allowed two weeks for rewriting from scratch in Ruby ! ”
Hilarious !
If you ’re still in business .
You want to be spending your time on things that get the most bang for the buck .
And you ca n’t figure out how much buck your bang is going to cost without knowing how long it ’s going to take .
When you have to decide between the “ animated paperclip ” feature and the “ more financial functions ” feature , you really need to know how much time each will take .
Why wo n’t developers make schedules ?
Two reasons .
One : it ’s a pain in the butt .
Two : nobody believes the schedule is realistic .
Why go to all the trouble of working on a schedule if it ’s not going to be right ?
Over the last year or so at Fog Creek we ’ve been developing a system that ’s so easy even our grouchiest developers are willing to go along with it .
And as far as we can tell , it produces extremely reliable schedules .
It ’s called Evidence - Based Scheduling , or EBS .
You gather evidence , mostly from historical timesheet data , that you feed back into your schedules .
What you get is not just one ship date : you get a confidence distribution curve , showing the probability that you will ship on any given date .
It looks like this :
The steeper the curve , the more confident you are that the ship date is real .
Here ’s how you do it .
1 ) Break ‘er down
When I see a schedule measured in days , or even weeks , I know it ’s not going to work .
You have to break your schedule into very small tasks that can be measured in hours .
Nothing longer than 16 hours .
This forces you to actually figure out what you are going to do .
Write subroutine foo .
Create this dialog box .
Parse the Fizzbott file .
Individual development tasks are easy to estimate , because you ’ve written subroutines , created dialogs , and parsed files before .
If you are sloppy , and pick big three - week tasks ( e.g. , “ Implement Ajax photo editor ” ) , then you have n’t thought about what you are going to do .
In detail .
Step by step .
And when you have n’t thought about what you ’re going to do , you ca n’t know how long it will take .
Setting a 16 - hour maximum forces you to design the damn feature .
If you have a hand - wavy three week feature called “ Ajax photo editor ” without a detailed design , I ’m sorry to be the one to break it to you but you are officially doomed .
You never thought about the steps it ’s going to take and you ’re sure to be forgetting a lot of them .
2 ) Track elapsed time
It ’s hard to get individual estimates exactly right .
How do you account for interruptions , unpredictable bugs , status meetings , and the semiannual Windows Tithe Day when you have to reinstall everything from scratch on your main development box ?
Heck , even without all that stuff , how can you tell exactly how long it ’s going to take to implement a given subroutine ?
You can ’t , really .
So , keep timesheets .
Keep track of how long you spend working on each task .
Then you can go back and see how long things took relative to the estimate .
For each developer , you ’ll be collecting data like this :
Each point on the chart is one completed task , with the estimate and actual times for that task .
When you divide estimate by actual , you get velocity : how fast the task was done relative to estimate .
Over time , for each developer , you ’ll collect a history of velocities .
The mythical perfect estimator , who exists only in your imagination , always gets every estimate exactly right .
So their velocity history is { 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , …}
A typical bad estimator has velocities all over the map , for example {0.1 , 0.5 , 1.7 , 0.2 , 1.2 , 0.9 , 13.0}
Most estimators get the scale wrong but the relative estimates right .
Everything takes longer than expected , because the estimate did n’t account for bug fixing , committee meetings , coffee breaks , and that crazy boss who interrupts all the time .
This common estimator has very consistent velocities , but they ’re below 1.0 .
For example , {0.6 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.6 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.6}
As estimators gain more experience , their estimating skills improve .
So throw away any velocities older than , say , six months .
If you have a new estimator on your team , who does n’t have a track record , assume the worst : give them a fake history with a wide range of velocities , until they ’ve finished a half - dozen real tasks .
3 ) Simulate the future
Rather than just adding up estimates to get a single ship date , which sounds right but gives you a profoundly wrong result , you ’re going to use the Monte Carlo method to simulate many possible futures .
In a Monte Carlo simulation , you can create 100 possible scenarios for the future .
Each of these possible futures has 1 % probability , so you can make a chart of the probability that you will ship by any given date .
While calculating each possible future for a given developer , you ’re going divide each task ’s estimate by a randomly - selected velocity from that developer ’s historical velocities , which we ’ve been gathering in step 2 .
Here ’s one sample future :
Estimate : 4 8 2 8 16 Random Velocity : 0.6 0.5 0.6 0.6 0.5 Total : E/V : 6.7 16 3.3 13.3 32 71.3
Do that 100 times ; each total has 1 % probability , and now you can figure out the probability that you will ship on any given date .
Now watch what happens :
In the case of the mythical perfect estimator , all velocities are 1 .
Dividing by a velocity which is always 1 has no effect .
Thus , all rounds of the simulation give the same ship date , and that ship date has 100 % probability .
Just like in the fairy tales !
The bad estimator ’s velocities are all over the map .
0.1 and 13.0 are just as likely .
Each round of the simulation is going to produce a very different result , because when you divide by random velocities you get very different numbers each time .
The probability distribution curve you get will be very shallow , showing an equal chance of shipping tomorrow or in the far future .
That ’s still useful information to get , by the way : it tells you that you should n’t have confidence in the predicted ship dates .
The common estimator has a lot of velocities that are pretty close to each other , for example , {0.6 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.6 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.6} .
When you divide by these velocities you increase the amount of time something takes , so in one iteration , an 8 - hour task might 13 hours ; in another it might take 15 hours .
That compensates for the estimators perpetual optimism .
And it compensates precisely , based exactly on this developers actual , proven , historical optimism .
And since all the historical velocities are pretty close , hovering around 0.6 , when you run each round of the simulation , you ’ll get pretty similar numbers , so you ’ll wind up with a narrow range of possible ship dates .
In each round of the Monte Carlo simulation , of course , you have to convert the hourly data to calendar data , which means you have to take into account each developer ’s work schedule , vacations , holidays , etc .
And then you have to see , for each round , which developer is finishing last , because that ’s when the whole team will be done .
These calculations are painstaking , but luckily , painstaking is what computers are good at .
Obsessive - compulsive disorder not required
What do you do about the boss who interrupts you all the time with long - winded stories about his fishing trips ?
Or the sales meetings you ’re forced to go to even though you have no reason to be there ?
Coffee breaks ?
Spending half a day helping the new guy get his dev environment set up ?
When Brett and I were developing this technique at Fog Creek , we worried a lot about things that take real time but ca n’t be predicted in advance .
Sometimes , this all adds up to more time than writing code .
Should you have estimates for this stuff too , and track it on a time sheet ?
Well , yeah , you can , if you want .
And Evidence Based Scheduling will work .
But you do n’t have to .
It turns out that EBS works so well that all you have to do is keep the clock running on whatever task you were doing when the interruption occurred .
As disconcerting as this may sound , EBS produces the best results when you do this .
Let me walk you through a quick example .
To make this example as simple as possible , I ’m going to imagine a very predictable programmer , John , whose whole job is writing those one - line getter and setter functions that inferior programming languages require .
All day long this is all he does :
private int width ;
public int getWidth ( ) { return width ; }
public void setWidth ( int _width} { width = _width ; }
I know , I know … it ’s a deliberately dumb example , but you know you ’ve met someone like this .
Anyway .
Each getter or setter takes him 2 hours .
So his task estimates look like this :
{ 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , … }
Now , this poor guy has a boss who interrupts him every once in a while with a two - hour conversation about marlin fishing .
Now , of course , John could have a task on his schedule called “ Painful conversations about marlin , ” and put that on his timesheet , but this might not be politically prudent .
Instead , John just keeps the clock running .
So his actual times look like this :
{ 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 4 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 4 , 2 , … }
And his velocities are :
{ 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0.5 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0.5 , 1 , … }
Now think about what happens .
In the Monte Carlo simulation , the probability that each estimate will be divided by 0.5 is exactly the same as the probability that John ’s boss would interrupt him during any given feature .
So EBS produces a correct schedule !
In fact , EBS is far more likely to have accurate evidence about these interruptions than even the most timesheet - obsessive developer .
Which is exactly why it works so well .
Here ’s how I explain this to people .
When developers get interrupted , they can either
make a big stink about putting the interruption on their timesheet and in their estimates , so management can see just how much time is being wasted on fishing conversation , or make a big stink about refusing to put it on their timesheet , just letting the feature they were working on slip , because they refuse to pad their estimates which were perfectly correct with stupid conversation about fishing expeditions to which they were n’t even invited ,
… and in either case , EBS gives the same , exactly correct results , no matter which type of passive - aggressive developer you have .
4 ) Manage your projects actively
Once you ’ve got this set up , you can actively manage projects to ship on time .
For example , if you sort features out into different priorities , it ’s easy to see how much it would help the schedule if you could cut the lower priority features .
You can also look at the distribution of possible ship dates for each developer :
Some developers ( like Milton in this picture ) may be causing problems because their ship dates are so uncertain : they need to work on learning to estimate better .
Other developers ( like Jane ) have very precise ship dates that are just too late : they need to have some of their work taken off their plate .
Other developers ( me! yay ! ) are not on the critical path at all , and can be left in peace .
Scope creep
Assuming you had everything planned down to the last detail when you started work , EBS works great .
To be honest , though , you may do some features that you had n’t planned .
You get new ideas , your salespeople sell features you do n’t have , and somebody on the board of directors comes up with a cool new idea to make your golf cart GPS application monitor EKGs while golfers are buzzing around the golf course .
All this leads to delays that could not have been predicted when you did the original schedule .
Ideally , you have a bunch of buffer for this .
In fact , go ahead and build buffer into your original schedule for :
New feature ideas Responding to the competition Integration ( getting everyone ’s code to work together when it ’s merged )
Debugging time Usability testing ( and incorporating the results of those tests into the product ) .
Beta tests
So now , when new features come up , you can slice off a piece of the appropriate buffer and use it for the new feature .
What happens if you ’re still adding features and you ’ve run out of buffer ?
Well , now the ship dates you get out of EBS start slipping .
You should take a snapshot of the ship date confidence distribution every night , so that you can track this over time :
The x -axis is when the calculation was done ; the y - axis is the ship date .
There are three curves here : the top one is the 95 % probability date , the middle is 50 % and the bottom is 5 % .
So , the closer the curves are to one another , the narrower the range of possible ship dates .
If you see ship date getting later and later ( rising curves ) , you ’re in trouble .
If it ’s getting later by more than one day per day , you ’re adding work faster than you ’re completing work , and you ’ll never be done .
You can also look and see if the ship date confidence distribution is getting tighter ( the curves are converging ) , which it should be if you ’re really converging on a date .
While we ’re at it
Here are a few more things I ’ve learned over the years about schedules .
1 ) Only the programmer doing the work can create the estimate .
Any system where management writes a schedule and hands it off to programmers is doomed to fail .
Only the programmer who is going to implement a feature can figure out what steps they will need to take to implement that feature .
2 ) Fix bugs as you find them , and charge the time back to the original task .
You ca n’t schedule a single bug fix in advance , because you do n’t know what bugs you ’re going to have .
When bugs are found in new code , charge the time to the original task that you implemented incorrectly .
This will help EBS predict the time it takes to get fully debugged code , not just working code .
3 ) Do n’t let managers badger developers into shorter estimates .
Many rookie software managers think that they can “ motivate ” their programmers to work faster by giving them nice , “ tight ” ( unrealistically short ) schedules .
I think this kind of motivation is brain - dead .
When I ’m behind schedule , I feel doomed and depressed and unmotivated .
When I ’m working ahead of schedule , I ’m cheerful and productive .
The schedule is not the place to play psychological games .
Why do managers try this ?
When the project begins , the technical managers go off , meet with the business people , and come up with a list of features they think would take about three months , but which would really take twelve .
When you think of writing code without thinking about all the steps you have to take , it always seems like it will take n time , when in reality it will probably take more like 4n time .
When you do a real schedule , you add up all the tasks and realize that the project is going to take much longer than originally thought .
The business people are unhappy .
Inept managers try to address this by figuring out how to get people to work faster .
This is not very realistic .
You might be able to hire more people , but they need to get up to speed and will probably be working at 50 % efficiency for several months ( and dragging down the efficiency of the people who have to mentor them ) .
You might be able to get 10 % more raw code out of people temporarily at the cost of having them burn out 100 % in a year .
Not a big gain , and it ’s a bit like eating your seed corn .
Of course , when you overwork people , debugging time doubles and a late project becomes later .
Splendid karma .
But you can never get 4n from n , ever , and if you think you can , please email me the stock symbol for your company so I can short it .
4 ) A schedule is a box of wood blocks .
If you have a bunch of wood blocks , and you ca n’t fit them into a box , you have two choices : get a bigger box , or remove some blocks .
If you wanted to ship in six months , but you have twelve months on the schedule , you are either going to have to delay shipping , or find some features to delete .
You just ca n’t shrink the blocks , and if you pretend you can , then you are merely depriving yourself of a useful opportunity to actually see into the future by lying to yourself about what you see there .
Now that I mention it , one of the great benefits of realistic schedules is that you are forced to delete features .
Why is this good ?
Suppose you have two features in mind .
One is really useful and will make your product really great .
The other is really easy and the programmers can’t wait to code it up ( ” Look ! < blink > ! ” ) , but it serves no useful purpose .
If you do n’t make a schedule , the programmers will do the easy / fun feature first .
Then they ’ll run out of time , and you will have no choice but to slip the schedule to do the useful / important feature .
If you do make a schedule , even before you start working , you ’ll realize that you have to cut something , so you ’ll cut the easy / fun feature and just do the useful / important feature .
By forcing yourself to chose some features to cut , you wind up making a more powerful , better product with a better mix of good features that ships sooner .
Way back when I was working on Excel 5 , our initial feature list was huge and would have gone way over schedule .
“ Oh my ! ” we thought .
“ Those are all super important features !
How can we live without a macro editing wizard ? ”
As it turns out , we had no choice , and we cut what we thought was “ to the bone ” to make the schedule .
Everybody felt unhappy about the cuts .
To make people feel better , we told ourselves that we were n’t cutting the features , we were simply deferring them to Excel 6 .
As Excel 5 was nearing completion , I started working on the Excel 6 spec with a colleague , Eric Michelman .
We sat down to go through the list of “ Excel 6 ” features that had been punted from the Excel 5 schedule .
Guess what ?
It was the shoddiest list of features you could imagine .
Not one of those features was worth doing .
I do n’t think a single one of them ever was .
The process of culling features to fit a schedule was the best thing we could have done .
If we had n’t done this , Excel 5 would have taken twice as long and included 50 % useless crap features that would have had to be supported , for backwards compatibility , until the end of time .
Summary
Using Evidence - Based Scheduling is pretty easy : it will take you a day or two at the beginning of every iteration to produce detailed estimates , and it ’ll take a few seconds every day to record when you start working on a new task on a timesheet .
The benefits , though , are huge : realistic schedules .
Realistic schedules are the key to creating good software .
It forces you to do the best features first and allows you to make the right decisions about what to build .
Which makes your product better , your boss happier , delights your customers , and — best of all — lets you go home at five o’clock .
P.S .
Evidence Based Scheduling is built into FogBugz 6.0 .
Poland 's Next Prime Minister Desires Withdrawal From Iraq
By VOA News
01 November 2007
Polish prime minister - designate Donald Tusk says he wants to pull Polish troops out of Iraq next year .
In an interview Wednesday with a daily newspaper , Polska , Tusk is quoted as saying his new government would want to finish the mission of the 900 troops still in Iraq .
Tusk also said he wants to continue good relations with Washington , but needs more information before deciding whether to back U.S. plans to build part of a European missile defense system in Poland .
He says he wants to know if housing 10 U.S. interceptor missiles in Poland increases or diminishes security .
In Washington , a White House spokeswoman , Dana Perino , expressed appreciation for the cooperation of countries working with the U.S. led coalition in Iraq .
She said the United States understands the difficulties in continuing the troop presence , but stressed their importance in guaranteeing security .
It 's very simple .
It 's Turing complete .
It 's easy to read and write .
It 's semantics are strong enough that we can do reasoning from it .
It 's got a good solid model .
It 's easy to create variants to explore the properties of various alternative ways of structuring computations or semantics .
Lambda Calculus Syntax
(1) Function definition : a function in lambda calculus is an expression , written :
lambda x . body
which means " a function with one parameter named X , which returns the result of evaluating the body " .
We say that the lambda expression binds the parameter .
which means " a function with one parameter named X , which returns the result of evaluating the body " .
We say that the lambda expression binds the parameter .
( 2 ) Identifier reference : an identifier reference is a name which matches the name of a parameter defined in a function expression enclosing the reference .
(3) Function application : applying a function is written by putting the function value in front of its parameter , as in " ( lambda x . plus x x ) y " .
Currying
lambda x y . plus x y
lambda x.( lambda y. plus x y )
Free vs Bound Identifiers
lambda x .
plus x y : in this expression , " y " and " plus " are free , because they 're not the parameter of any enclosing lambda expression ; x is bound because it's a parameter of the function definition enclosing the expression " plus x y " where it 's referenced .
lambda x y.y x : in this expression both x and y are bound , because they are parameters of the function definition .
lambda y . ( lambda x . plus x y ) :
In the inner lambda , " lambda x . plus x y " , y and plus are free and x is bound .
In the full expression , both x and y are bound : x is bound by the inner lambda , and y is bound by the other lambda .
" plus " is still free .
Lambda Calculus Evaluation Rules
Alpha Conversion
lambda x . if ( = x 0 ) then 1 else x^2
lambda y . if ( = y 0 ) then 1 else y^2
Beta Reduction

lambda y . ( lambda x . x + y ) ) q
lambda x. x+q
( lambda x y. x y ) ( lambda z . z * z ) 3
lambda z . z * z
( lambda z . z * z ) 3
lambda x . B e = B[x := e ] if free (e ) subset free ( B[x := e ]
lambda z . lambda x . x+z )
( lambda z . ( lambda x . x + z ) ) ( x + 2 )
lambda x . x + x + 2

( In the original version of this post , I tried using a javascript tool for generating MathML .
It appears to not work very well ; several browsers failed to render it correctly , and it does n't work in an RSS feed .
I 've gone back and re-written everything in simple text format . )
In computer science , especially in the field of programming languages , we tend to use one particular calculus a lot : the Lambda calculus .
Lambda calculus is also extensively used by logicians studying the nature of computation and the structure of discrete mathematics .
Lambda calculus is great for a lot of reasons , among them :
The ease of reading and writing lambda calculus is a big deal .
It 's led to the development of a lot of extremely good programming languages based , to one degree or another , on the lambda calculus : Lisp , ML , and Haskell are very strongly lambda calculus based .
The lambda calculus is based on the concept of functions .
In the pure lambda calculus , everything is a function ; there are no values at all except for functions .
But we can build up anything we need using functions .
Remember back in the early days of this blog , I talked a bit about how to build mathematics ?
We can build the entire structure of mathematics from nothing but lambda calculus .
So , enough lead - in .
Let 's dive in a look at LC .
Remember that for a calculus , you need to define two things : the syntax , which describes how valid expressions can be written in the calculus ; and a set of rules that allow you to symbolically manipulate the expressions .
The lambda calculus has exactly three kinds of expressions : There 's a trick that we play in lambda calculus : if you look at the definition above , you 'll notice that a function ( lambda expression ) only takes one parameter .
That seems like a very big constraint - how can you even implement addition with only one parameter ?
It turns out to be no problem , because of the fact that functions are values .
So instead of writing a two parameter function , you can write a one parameter function that returns a one parameter function - in the end , it 's effectively the same thing .
It 's called currying , after the great logician Haskell Curry .
For example , suppose we wanted to write a function to add x and y .
We 'd like to write something like : .
The way we do that with one - parameter functions is : we write one function with one parameter , which returns another function in one parameter .
Adding x plus y becomes writing a one - parameter function with parameter x , which returns another one parameter function which adds x to its parameter :
Now that we know that adding multiple parameter functions does n't really add anything but a bit of simplified syntax , we 'll go ahead and use them when it 's convenient .
One important syntactic issue that I have n't mentioned yet is closure or complete binding .
For a lambda calculus expression to be evaluated , it cannot reference any identifiers that are not bound .
An identifier is bound if it a parameter in an enclosing lambda expression ; if an identifier is not bound in any enclosing context , then it is called a free variable .
We 'll often use " free ( x ) " to mean the set of identifiers that are free in the expression " x " .
A lambda calculus expression is completely valid only when all of its variables are bound .
But when we look at smaller subexpressions of a complex expression , taken out of context , they can have free variables - and making sure that the variables that are free in subexpressions are treated right is very important .
There are only two real rules in lambda calculus ; they 're called alpha and beta .
Alpha is also called " conversion " , and beta is also called " reduction " .
alpha is a renaming operation ; basically it says that the names of variables are unimportant : given any expression in lambda calculus , we can change the name of the parameter to a function as long as we change all free references to it inside the body .
So - for instance , if we had an expression like :
We can do alpha changing X to Y ( written " alpha[x / y ] " and get ) : Doing alpha does not change the meaning of the expression in any way .
But as we 'll see later , it 's important because it gives us a way of doing things like recursion .
Beta reduction is where things get interesting : this single rule is all that 's needed to make the lambda calculus capable of performing any computation that can be done by a machine .
Beta basically says that if you have a function application , you can replace it with a copy of the body of the function with references to the parameter identifiers replaced by references to the parameter value in the application .
That sounds confusing , but it 's actually pretty easy when you see it in action .
Suppose we have the application expression : " " .
What beta says is that we can replace the application by taking the body of the function ( which is " x + 1 " ) ; and replacing references to the parameter " x " by the value " 3 " ; so the result of the beta reduction is " 3 + 1 " .
A slightly more complicated example is the expression :
It 's an interesting expression , because it 's a lambda expression that when applied , results in another lambda expression : that is , it 's a function that creates functions .
When we do beta reduction in this , we 're replacing all references to the parameter " y " with the identifier " q " ; so , the result is " " .
One more example , just for the sake of being annoying : " .
That 's a function that takes two parameters , and applies the first one to the second one .
When we evaluate that , we replace the parameter " x " in the body of the first function with " " ; and we replace the parameter " y " with " 3 " , getting : " " .
And we can perform beta on that , getting " 3 * 3 " .
Written formally , beta says : That condition on the end , " if free ( e ) subset free ( B[x := e ] " is why we need alpha : we can only do beta reduction if doing it does n't create any collisions between bound identifiers and free identifiers : if the identifier " z " is free in " e " , then we need to be sure that the beta - reduction does n't make " z " become bound .
If there is a name collision between a variable that is bound in " B " and a variable that is free in " e " , then we need to use alpha to change the identifier names so that they 're different .
As usual , an example will make that clearer : Suppose we have a expression defining a function , " " .
Now , suppose we want to apply it :
In the parameter " ( x + 2 ) " , x is free .
Now , suppose we break the rule and go ahead and do beta .
We 'd get :
The variable that was free in " x + 2 " is now bound .
Now suppose we apply that function :
By beta , we 'd get " 3 + 3 + 2 " .
What if we did alpha the way we were supposed to ? by alpha[x /y ] : by beta : by beta again : " 3+x + 2 " and " 3+3+2 " are very different results !
And that 's pretty much it .
There 's another rule you canadd called Eta-reduction , but we 'll skip that for now .
What I 've described here is Turing complete - a full effective computation system .
To make it useful , and see how this can be used to do real stuff , we need to define a bunch of basic functions that allow us to do math , condition tests , recursion , etc .
I 'll talk about those in my next post .
We also have n't defined a model for lambda - calculus yet .
( I discussed models here and here . )
That 's actually quite an important thing !
LC was played with by logicians for several years before they were able to come up with a complete model for it , and it was a matter of great concern that although LC looked correct , the early attempts to define a model for it were failures .
After all , remember that if there is n't a valid model , that means that the results of the system are meaningless !
This Is What It 's Come To

Our government is now unable to say whether it would be a violation of the Geneva Conventions for the Iranian government to waterboard a downed U.S. airman .
How do officials such as Brigadier General Hartmann sleep at night , I wonder ?
How many decades will it take to undo this damage ?
Kudos to Lindsey Graham , whose disgust is really the only appropriate response .
Now , if he can only muster some of his colleagues to support a two - thirds vote to override the forthcoming presidential veto of the law that would end the CIA 's " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
" Somebody once said that in looking for people to hire , you look for three qualities : integrity , intelligence , and energy .
And if they do n’t have the first , the other two will kill you .
You think about it ; it ’s true .
If you hire somebody without the first , you really want them to be dumb and lazy . "

Storyline :
Temujin , or Genghis Khan as we know him , was a great thirteenth century Mongol warrior who had conquered more land in 25 years than the Romans did in 400 years .
In the process he connected many civilizations from Europe to Asia .
He abolished the old system based on special privilege for the rich and introduced a more equitable system based on qualifications and accomplishments .
He lived the simple life of a nomad , distributed his wealth to people and established a fair system based on law and order .
In war he was ruthless but in friendship he was kind .
He valued loyalty as a very important trait in people .
In the early 13th century , the Mongol forces finally defeated their archrival Jamuka once and for all .
Jamuka fled to distant mountains with some of his soldiers .
The life in exile was very difficult and hard to handle for soldiers who had prospered under Jamuka and were used to life of affluence .
Unable to cope with the harsh life , they tied up their leader and took him to Temujin hoping for amnesty and a handsome reward .
Guess what Temujin did to those soldiers ?
Temujin executed them all .
But to his opponent he was gracious , and asked Jamuka to join him .
Reflection :
For Temujin , loyalty was not selective for good times and richness only .
What do you think those soldiers would have done to him if he was having tough times ?
It is in the bad times that a persons ’ loyalty is truly tested .
WASHINGTON , May 18 — Casualties among private contractors in Iraq have soared to record levels this year , setting a pace that seems certain to turn 2007 into the bloodiest year yet for the civilians who work alongside the American military in the war zone , according to new government numbers .
At least 146 contract workers were killed in Iraq in the first three months of the year , by far the highest number for any quarter since the war began in March 2003 , according to the Labor Department , which processes death and injury claims for those working as United States government contractors in Iraq .
That brings the total number of contractors killed in Iraq to at least 917 , along with more than 12,000 wounded in battle or injured on the job , according to government figures and dozens of interviews .
The numbers , which have not been previously reported , disclose the extent to which contractors —
Americans , Iraqis and workers from more than three dozen other countries — are largely hidden casualties of the war , and now are facing increased risks alongside American soldiers and marines as President Bush ’s plan to increase troop levels in Baghdad takes hold .
According to the Media Blog Jon Stewart will pay the writers out of his own pocket for 2 weeks .
From the blog :
In a show of solidarity with his fellow scribes , the Daily Show host has told his writing staff that he will cover all their salaries for the next two weeks , according to a well - placed source .
He has also vowed to do the same for writers on The Colbert Report .
A Comedy Central spokesman referred my inquiry about this to Stewart 's personal publicist , who has yet to respond .......
Stewart 's intention , says the source , is to ensure his writers will face no financial hardship should the strike , which kicked off at 3 a.m. local time , conclude within that timeframe .
It should come as no surprise that Stewart is a union die - hard :
He tells the current issue of Rolling Stone that his childhood heroes included socialist leaders Eugene V. Debs and Norman Thomas .
Kudos to Stewart for supporting unions !
While we will desperately miss The Daily Show and The Colbert Report , it 's nice to know that he 's looking out for his crew .
** UPDATE **
In case you needed a reminder , This article from Howard Kurtz highlights the reason we need Stewart back on the air , soon .
Who else with a national television audience is making this point ?
On " The Daily Show , " Jon Stewart worked up a head of steam challenging my argument that the anchors had framed the Iraq story in a way that helped turn public opinion against the war .
To him , they were just delivering the facts , not making editorial judgments .
" Let 's say 20 people are killed in a bombing , " he said .
" How do you not report on that ?
In what world is that not a kind of big story ? "
As I explained that the daily body count had become so depressingly familiar that the anchors had searched for other ways to underscore and emphasize the carnage , Stewart argued that such basic reporting was , quite simply , their job .
Our allotted time had expired , but Stewart kept going for several more minutes -- which he knew would never be aired -- venting about the media 's inability or unwillingness to get at the " truth . "
The crowd , of course , loved it .
** UPDATE II **
Another update from Portfolio's Media Blog is now saying Stewart 's Rep has denied this .
UPDATE , 2:20 P.M. : Confusion : Jon Stewart 's rep just called back to deny the information above .
I checked back with my source , who set me straight on a few details : Stewart is not paying writers out of his own pocket , but through Busboy , his production company .
And it 's not just writers who are getting their salaries covered but all the shows ' employees .
" He 's hoping that it wraps up amicably and quickly , and over the course of that time he wants to look out for his employees , " he says .
But when I ran this by Stewart 's rep , he emailed back , " While I hesitate to knock down every rumor that comes up , the assertion that Jon and / or Busboy Productions will be paying for the staff is false and we have no further comment beyond this at this time . "
I 'm pretty sure there 's some truthiness here ( sorry ) , but it may take some more digging to determine exactly what the situation is .
Well , it seems that facts are still being sorted out .
I 'll leave the diary up until I get confirmation of what the actual story is .
But it seems several people have run with the story .
Gestern gegen 10.30
Uhr fuhr ein Erwachsener mit drei Kindern auf der BAB 5 Richtung Karlsruhe .
Ein Kormoran , der die Autobahn im Tiefflug querte , prallte gegen die Windschutzscheibe des Autos .
Bei einer Geschwindigkeit von 100 bis 120 km/h verursachte der Vogel in der Scheibe ein Loch in der Größe eines Handballs .
The 58 men and women who worked on the original draft of the new Florida science standards are now back at it .
They ’re going through all the public and professional input that has flooded in over the past few months .
May the force be with them .
This opinion article in the Miami Herald by writer Fred Grimm gave me some serious things to ponder .
Oscar Howard Jr. , superintendent of Taylor County ’s School District , and Danny Lundy , vice chairman of the School Board , spoke in accents from that other Florida .
” We ’re opposed to teaching evolution as a fact , ” Howard said , adding that his School Board and 11 others have passed resolutions against the imposition of evolution in the school curriculum .
Wait a minute .
Did I read that right ?
Eleven other counties passed anti-evolution resolutions ?
How in the world did that escape any real public notice until now ?
I ’m only aware of three right now .
I can understand a few school boards hiding in the shadows and only attracting the attention of their little weekly newspapers .
But 12 total ?
TWELVE ?!
And here I was feeling so clever for discovering one by poking around in search engines .
I feel silly now .
And here ’s a real good point that should shame just about everyone that has been stomping their feet about how offensive evolution is to them .
Then , the final speaker , Lisa Dizengoff , director of science curriculum at Pembroke Pines Charter School ’s east campus , angrily reminded the crowd that after all the carping over evolution , no one had gotten around to addressing the state ’s lackadaisical , last - century approach to science education .
” All I heard was this argument about evolution , ” she said , disgusted that so many other problems had been preempted by a single controversy .
“ The kids lost out again . ”
Yes , I agree .

BBC News , Baghdad
There is general recognition that the security situation in Baghdad and some other parts of Iraq has got significantly better in the past three months or so .
The US surge has brought calm to previously restive areas of Baghdad
There are thought to be nearly 80,000 of them nationwide .
Many of them used to fight alongside the insurgents , but now , encouraged by their tribal leaders , they have turned against al - Qaeda and are helping keep it out of their areas .
We went to al - Ameriya , a journey we would not have dreamt of attempting just a few months ago , to see some of the local fighters in action .
This part of Baghdad used to be a stronghold of al - Qaeda or groups linked to it .
Knights of Mesopotamia
Now we are travelling , not with the American army as we might once have done , but with a tribal Sunni sheikh whose followers are now controlling the area along with the Americans , helping to drive al - Qaeda out and to keep it out .
People saw al - Qaeda doing terrible things .
They were killing Sunnis , Shias , and Christians .
There were bodies everywhere , being eaten by dogs .
So we had to fight them
Abdul Abed
We are under the protection of the Fursan al - Rafidain , the Knights of Mesopotamia , a force of about 600 , and they clearly rule the roost in al - Ameriya .
They are paid and supplied with uniforms by the Americans , and work closely with them .
Our first stop was at their headquarters .
Their leader , Abul Abed , meets the Americans every day .
On the wall is a picture of him with General David Petraeus , the top US commander in Iraq .
But it was not always that way .
Before turning against al - Qaeda , he used to be in an insurgent group which fought the Americans .
" At the beginning , people saw it as an occupation which had to be resisted .
But then they saw that the Americans were working in the interests of the people .
" They saw al - Qaeda doing terrible things .
They were killing Sunnis , Shias , and Christians .
There were bodies everywhere , being eaten by dogs .
So we had to fight them , " Abul Abed said .
Transformation
On the main street of al - Ameriya , shops are open , people are walking around , they say that there has been a complete transformation in the area - not so long ago it was like a kind of ghost town , bodies piling up in the street , garbage everywhere , and basically al - Qaeda in control .
Bilal al - Rawi , a shopkeeper who was here throughout the troubles , says there has been a huge change from the deserted streets and closed market , and he hopes there will be no return to the dark days of just a few months ago .
It was really bad .
There was killing and beating .
We could n't go out .
We were afraid of snipers .
There were bodies everywhere .
But now , thank God , it 's not like that
Amal Ali
We hear American helicopters buzzing overhead reminding everybody who is the real power behind all this , but the transformation on the ground is remarkable .
Further down the street , we bumped into some Iraqi Army forces with some American officers .
Maj William Kahmann of the Fifth Cavalry was doing a little light shopping - something he could not have done until recently .
" I could not walk up and down the street like I am today and go into a shop and actually purchase something , " Maj Kahmann said .
" People were very hesitant to talk to us , because they knew that when we leave , al - Qaeda would come in behind us and probably talk to them and say , hey , why are you discussing anything with the Americans . "
The major said that the role of the Sunni force , the Knights of Mesopotamia was critical .
" They knew better than anybody who was an outsider to al - Ameriya , especially al - Qaeda , and they were able to provide that intelligence so we could specifically target those individuals . "
Return to al - Ameriya
About 60 Shia families have moved back into the mainly Sunni area .
Amal Ali fled al - Ameriya earlier this year with her six children , when masked men threatened to kill them .
" It was really bad .
There was killing and beating .
We could n't go out .
We were afraid of snipers .
There were bodies everywhere .
But now , thank God , it 's not like that .
Things are good again thanks to Abul Abed , " she said .
But the leader of the Knights of Mesopotamia comes with a mixed reputation .
He has even been compared to a Mafia don .
There are also fears that building up what are essentially Sunni militias , could be storing up problems for the future .
But for the moment , in al - Ameriya and elsewhere , it is working .
Humans have altered Earth so much that scientists say a new epoch in the planet 's geologic history has begun .
Say goodbye to the 10,000 - year - old Holocene Epoch and hello to the Anthropocene .
Among the major changes heralding this two - century - old man -made epoch :
Vastly altered sediment erosion and deposition patterns .
Major disturbances to the carbon cycle and global temperature .
Wholesale changes in biology , from altered flowering times to new migration patterns .
Acidification of the ocean , which threatens tiny marine life that forms the bottom of the food chain .
The idea , first suggested in 2000 by Nobel Prize - winning chemist Paul Crutzen , has gained steam with two new scientific papers that call for official recognition of the shift .
Vivid metaphor
In the February issue of the journal GSA Today , a publication of the Geological Society of America , Jan Zalasiewicz and Mark Williams of the University of Leicester and colleagues at the Geological Society of London argue that industrialization has wrought changes that usher in a new epoch .
Scientists of the future will have no trouble deciding if the proposal was timely .
All they 'll need to do is dig into the planet and examine its stratigraphic layers , which reveal a chronology of the changing conditions that existed as each layer is created .
Layers can reflect volcanic upheaval , ice ages or mass extinctions .
" Sufficient evidence has emerged of stratigraphically significant change ( both elapsed and imminent ) for recognition of the Anthropocene — currently a vivid yet informal metaphor of global environmental change — as a new geological epoch to be considered for formalization by international discussion , " Zalasiewicz 's team writes .
The paper calls on the International Commission on Stratigraphy to officially mark the shift .
In a separate paper last month in the journal Soil Science , researchers focused on soil infertility alone as a reason to dub this the Anthropocene Age .
( The term " age " is sometimes used interchangeably with " epoch " or to indicate a transition period between epochs . )
As an example , they said , agriculture in Africa " has so degraded regional soil fertility that the economic development of whole nations will be diminished without drastic improvements of soil management . "
" With more than half of all soils on Earth now being cultivated for food crops , grazed , or periodically logged for wood , how to sustain Earth ’s soils is becoming a major scientific and policy issue , " said Duke University soil scientist Daniel Richter .
Richter 's work was supported by the National Science Foundation , the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation .
Origin of a term
Earth 's 4.5 - billion - year history is divided into major eras , then periods and finally epochs .
The Holocene Epoch began after the last Ice Age .
As early as the late 1800s scientists were writing about man 's wholesale impact on the planet and the possibility of an " anthropozoic era " having begun , according to Crutzen , who is credited with coining the term Anthropocene ( anthropo = human ; cene = new ) back in 2000 .
That year , Crutzen and a colleague wrote in the scientific newsletter International Geosphere - Biosphere Programme about some of the dramatic changes :
" Urbanization has ... increased tenfold in the past century .
In a few generations mankind is exhausting the fossil fuels that were generated over several hundred million years . "
Up to half of Earth 's land has been transformed by human activity , wrote Crutzen and Eugene F. Stoermer of the University of Michigan .
They also noted the dramatic increase in greenhouse gases and other chemicals and pollutants humans have introduced into global ecosystems .
The epochal idea has merit , according to geologist Richard Alley of Pennsylvania State University .
" In land , water , air , ice , and ecosystems , the human impact is clear , large , and growing , " Alley told ScienceNow , an online publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
" A geologist from the far distant future almost surely would draw a new line , and begin using a new name , where and when our impacts show up . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The only surviving copy of the 500 - year - old map that first used the name America goes on permanent display this month at the Library of Congress , but even as it prepares for its debut , the 1507 Waldseemuller map remains a puzzle for researchers .
A detail of the map that first used the name " America " is seen at the Library of Congress in Washington , December 3 , 2007 .
The 500 - year - old map , created by German monk Martin Waldseemuller , is the only known surviving copy and was purchased for $ 10 million in 2003 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
Why did the mapmaker name the territory America and then change his mind later ?
How was he able to draw South America so accurately ?
Why did he put a huge ocean west of America years before European explorers discovered the Pacific ?
“ That ’s the kind of conundrum , the question , that is still out there , ” said John Hebert , chief of the geography and map division of the Library of Congress .
The 12 sheets that make up the map , purchased from German Prince Johannes Waldburg - Wolfegg for $ 10 million in 2003 , were mounted on Monday in a huge 6 - foot by 9.5 - foot ( 1.85 meter by 2.95 meter ) display case machined from a single block of aluminum .
The case will be flooded with inert argon gas to prevent deterioration when it goes on public display December 13 .
Researchers are hopeful that putting the rarely shown map on permanent display for the first time since it was discovered in the Waldburg - Wolfegg castle archives in 1901 may stimulate interest in finding out more about the documents used to produce it .
The map was created by the German monk Martin Waldseemuller .
Thirteen years after Christopher Columbus first landed in the Western Hemisphere , the Duke of Lorraine brought Waldseemuller and a group of scholars together at a monastery in Saint - Die in France to create a new map of the world .
The result , published two years later , is stunningly accurate and surprisingly modern .
“ The actual shape of South America is correct , ” said Hebert .
“ The width of South America at certain key points is correct within 70 miles of accuracy . ”
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Given what Europeans are believed to have known about the world at the time , it should not have been possible for the mapmakers to produce it , he said .
The map gives a reasonably correct depiction of the west coast of South America .
But according to history , Vasco Nunez de Balboa did not reach the Pacific by land until 1513 , and Ferdinand Magellan did not round the southern tip of the continent until 1520 .
“ So this is a rather compelling map to say , ‘ How did they come to that conclusion , ’ ” Hebert said .
The mapmakers say they based it on the 1,300 - year - old works of the Egyptian geographer Ptolemy as well as letters Florentine navigator Amerigo Vespucci wrote describing his voyages to the new world .
But Hebert said there must have been something more .
“ From the writings of Vespucci you could n’t have prepared the map , ” Hebert said .
“ There had to be something cartographic with it . ”
MISGIVINGS ABOUT AMERICA
Waldseemuller made it clear he was naming the new land after Vespucci , describing how he came up with the name America based on the navigator ’s first name .
But he soon had misgivings about what he had done .
An atlas Waldseemuller produced six years later shows only part of the east coast of the Americas , and refers to it as Terra Incognita -- unknown land .
“ America has gone out of his lexicon , ” Hebert said .
“ ( No ) place in the atlas -- in the text or in the maps -- does the name America appear . ”
His 1516 mariner ’s map , on the same scale as the 1507 map , steps back even further , showing only parts of the new continents and reconnecting the north to Asia .
South America is labeled Terra Nova -- New World -- and North America is labeled Terra de Cuba -- Land of Cuba .
“ Essentially he ’s reconnecting North America to the Asian mainland , suggesting a continual world of land mass rather than separated by those bodies of water that separate us from Europe and Asia , ” Hebert said .
Why the rollback ?
No one knows .
In writings accompanying the 1516 map , Waldseemuller comes across as if he “ has seen the better of his error and is now correcting it , ” Hebert said .
He speculated that power politics played a role .
Spain and Portugal divided the globe between them in 1494 , two years after Columbus , with territory to the east going to Portugal and land to the west to Spain .
That demarcation line is oddly absent from the 1507 Waldseemuller map , and flags marking territorial claims in South America suggest Portugal controls the region ’s southernmost land , even though it is in Spain ’s area of influence .
On the later map , the southernmost flag is Spanish , Hebert said .
“ It is possible one could say the 1507 map is influenced strongly by Portuguese sources and conceivably the 1516 map may be influenced more by Spanish sources , ” he said .
Although the map conceals many mysteries , one thing is clear : it represents a revolutionary shift in the way Europe viewed the world .
“ This is ... essentially the beginning or first map of the modern age , and it ’s one that everything builds on from that point forward , ” Hebert said .
“ It becomes a keystone map . ”

" Fans have flocked to a church in Germany to hear a chord change in a musical composition that lasts for 639 years , " reports the BBC .
" It is the first change in the piece , As Slow As Possible , in seven years .
" The Guardian reports : The BBC notes the score for the 639 - year composition is just eight pages long .
But though the piece was written in the 1980s , it was n't until nine years after the composer 's death in 1992 that anyone dared to attempt playing it .
That performance then began — with a pause that lasted nearly 18 months .
The next chord change is scheduled for February 5 of the year 2022 .
Rapper Lil' Romeo Signs to Play Basketball at USC ( Video )
It looks like , known as rapper , is trading in his microphone for a basketball , with a full scholarship to USC .
Lil' Romeo , son of rapper Master P , is currently a senior at Beverly Hills High .
Romeo signed his letter of intent to play basketball for the USC Trojans yesterday at a press event at Four Seasons , Beverly Hills , along with Demar DeRozen from Compton High .
( See video of press event and signing below . )
" This is the most important thing I 've had to do and hopefully it sends a message to kids across the country that education is more important than money , " Miller said at the news conference .
" Getting a college scholarship is more important than winning an American Music Award , and I plan to be the best student - athlete I can be at USC .
I had the privilege of seeing Lil' Romeo play basketball a few years ago with his dad , Master P , as his coach .
He is a talented kid and I wo n't be surprised if he ends up in the NBA .

Jean - Philip Delhomme
The night flight to Paris leaves J.F.K. at 7 P.M. and arrives at de Gaulle the next day at about 8:45 A.M. French time .
Between takeoff and landing , there ’s a brief parody of an evening : dinner is served , the trays are cleared , and four hours later it ’s time for breakfast .
The idea is to trick the body into believing it has passed a night like any other — that your unsatisfying little nap was actually sleep and now you are rested and deserving of an omelette .
Hoping to make the lie more convincing , many passengers prepare for bed .
I ’ll watch them line up outside the bathroom , some holding toothbrushes , some dressed in slippers or loose - fitting pajama - type outfits .
Their slow - footed padding gives the cabin the feel of a hospital ward : the dark aisles , corridors ; the flight attendants , nurses .
The hospital feeling grows even stronger once you leave coach .
Up front , where the seats recline almost flat , like beds , the doted - on passengers lie under their blankets and moan .
I ’ve heard , in fact , that the airline staff often refers to the business - class section as “ the I.C.U. , ” because the people there demand such constant attention .
They want what their superiors are getting in first class , so they complain incessantly , hoping to get bumped up .
There are only two classes on the airline I normally take between France and the United States — coach and something they call Business Elite .
The first time I sat there , I was flown to America and back for a book tour .
“ Really , ” I kept insisting , “ there ’s no need . ”
I found the whole “ first - to - board ” business a little embarrassing , but then they brought me a bowl of hot nuts and I began to soften .
Pampering takes some getting used to .
A flight attendant addresses me as “ Mr. Sedaris , ” and I feel sorry that she ’s forced to memorize my name rather than , say , her granddaughter ’s cell - phone number .
On this particular airline , though , they do it in such a way that it seems perfectly natural , or at least it does after a time .
“ May I bring you a drink to go with those warm nuts , Mr. Sedaris ? ” the woman looking after me asked — this as the people in coach were still boarding .
The looks they gave me as they passed were the looks I give when the door of a limousine opens .
You always expect to see a movie star , or , at the very least , someone better dressed than you , but time and time again it ’s just a sloppy nobody .
Thus the look , which translates to “ Fuck you , Sloppy Nobody , for making me turn my head . ”
On all my subsequent flights , the Business Elite section was a solid unit , but on this particular plane it was divided into two sections : four rows up front and two in the back .
The flight attendant assured everyone in my section that although we were technically in the back , we should n’t think of it as the back .
We had the same rights and privileges as the passengers ahead of us .
Yet still they were ahead of us , and I could n’t shake the feeling that they ’d been somehow favored .
On the way to New York , I sat beside a bearded Frenchman , who popped a pill shortly after takeoff and was out until we landed .
On the leg back , there was no one beside me , at least not for the first half hour .
Then a flight attendant knelt in the aisle beside my seat and asked if I might do her a favor — that ’s how they talk in Business Elite .
“ I ’m wondering , Mr. Sedaris , if you might do me a favor ? ”
Chipmunk - like , my cheeks packed with warm nuts , I cocked my head .
“ I ’ve got a passenger a few rows up and his crying is disturbing the people around him .
Do you think it would be O.K. if he moved and sat here ? ”
The woman was blond and heavily made up .
Glasses hung from a chain around her neck , and as she gestured to the empty window seat beside me I got a pleasant whiff of what smelled like oatmeal cookies .
“ I believe he ’s Polish , ” she whispered .
“ That is to say , I think he ’s from Poland .
The country . ”
“ Is he a child ? ” I asked , and the flight attendant told me no .
“ Is he drunk ? ” It did n’t matter one way or the other .
I was just curious .
Again , she said no .
“ His mother just died and he ’s on his way to her funeral . ”
“ So people are upset because he ’s crying over his dead mother ? ”
“ That ’s the situation , ” she told me .
I ’d once read where a first - class passenger complained — threatened to sue , if I remember correctly — because the blind person next to him was travelling with a Seeing Eye dog .
He was n’t allergic , this guy .
Labrador retrievers on the street did n’t bother him , but he had n’t paid thousands of dollars to sit next to one , or at least that was his argument .
If that had seemed the last word in assholiness , this was a close second .
I said that of course the man could sit beside me , and the flight attendant disappeared into the darkness , returning a few minutes later with the grieving passenger .
“ Thank you , ” she mouthed .
And I said , “ No problem . ”
The Polish man might have been in his mid-forties but seemed older , just as people in my parents ’ generation had .
Foreign blood , or an abundance of responsibility , had robbed him of the prolonged adolescence currently enjoyed by Americans of the same age , so his face , though unlined , seemed older than mine , more used .
His eyes were red and swollen from crying , and his nose , which was large and many - faceted , looked as if it had been roughly carved from wood and not yet sanded smooth .
In the dim light , he resembled one of those elaborate , handcrafted bottle stoppers — the kindly peasant or good - natured drunk who tips his hat when you pull the string .
After settling in , the man looked out the darkened window .
Then he bit his lower lip , covered his face with his remarkably large hands , and proceeded to sob , deeply .
I felt that I should say something , but what ?
And how ?
Perhaps it would be better , less embarrassing for him , if I were to pretend that he was n’t crying — to ignore him , basically .
And so I did .
The Polish man did n’t want dinner , just waved it away with those king - size mitts of his , but I could feel him watching as I cut into my herb - encrusted chicken , most likely wondering how anyone could carry on at a time like this .
That ’s how I felt when my mother died .
The funeral took place on a Saturday afternoon in November .
It was unseasonably warm that day , even for Raleigh , and returning from the church we passed people working on their lawns as if nothing had happened .
One guy even had his shirt off .
“ Can you beat that ? ” I said to my sister Lisa , not thinking of all the funeral processions that had passed me over the years — me laughing , me throwing stones at signs , me trying to stand on my bicycle seat .
Now here I was eating — and it was n’t bad , either .
The best thing about this particular airline is that after dinner they offer you a sundae .
The vanilla ice cream is in the bowl already , but you can choose from any number of toppings .
I order the caramel and chopped nuts and the flight attendant spoons them on before my eyes .
“ Is that enough sauce , Mr. Sedaris ? ” she ’ll ask , and “ Are you sure you do n’t want whipped cream ? ”
It would be years before I worked up the courage to ask for seconds , and , when I finally did , I felt like such a dope .
“ Do you think , um . . .
I mean , is it possible to have another one of those ? ”

When chatter in the mainstream media and in the blogosphere intersects with scientific discourse , I ’m always interested in the ways that citations do , or do n’t , cross the border between those domains .
In 2006 , for example , while checking references for a podcast with Steve Burbeck about multicellular computing , I traced a meme about how we humans are really a hybrid of human and bacterial cells .
The mainstream vector was a New York Times magazine story on obesity .
It got to the blogosophere by way of a Wired News story .
But the original Nature Biotechnology article mentioned in the Wired story was linked nowhere that I could find .
A comment from Gordon Mohr on yesterday ’s item about Many Eyes prompted a similar analysis .
Gordon asks :
… do the Many Eyes founders consider the statistical paradox that when testing large numbers of hypotheses , * most * recognized ’ statistically significant ’ results may in fact be false ?
A good discussion of the issue is here : http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/09/why_most_publis.html
To answer Gordon ’s question , I do n’t know , it did n’t come up in our conversation .
But lets look at the conversation surrounding the PloS Medicine article cited in the blog entry to which Gordon points .
The blog entry itself was widely noticed , it has 31 del.icio.us bookmarks .
What about the PloS Medicine article cited in this popular blog entry ?
It has only 6 del.icio.us bookmarks .
This is the URL cited by the marginalrevolution blog :
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=16060722
It ’s not the most canonical form of the article ’s URL .
A more canonical form would be the base PubMed record :
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16060722
That URL has 0 del.icio.us citations .
However , now we cross over into the realm of scientific discourse .
When you visit that PubMed URL , you ’ll discover citations in the PubMed domain :
There ’s another canonical form for the PloS Medicine article , by the way .
It has a Digital Oject Identifier ( DOI ) :
http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124
Interestingly , there is 1 del.icio.us citation for that DOI .
So , what did the PloS Medicine folks have to say about the claim in the cited August 2005 PloS Medicine article ?
Here ’s an April 2007 reaction :
The mathematical proof offered for this in the PLoS Medicine paper shows merely that the more studies published on any subject , the higher the absolute number of false positive ( and false negative ) studies .
It does not show what the papers ’ graphs and text claim , viz , that the number of false claims will be a higher proportion of the total number of studies published ( i.e. , that the positive predictive value of each study decreases with increasing number of studies ) .
I ’m not interested here in the claim and counterclaim .
I ’m interested in the process of discourse , in citation as the engine of that discourse , in the role that canonical identifiers play in citation , and in the disconnect between scientific and mainstream discourse .
It ’s all happening on the web , but it ’s happening in isolated ghettoes with few points of actual contact .
How could we bring those worlds into closer contact ?
Here ’s one approach that could help .
When the citation engines in the blogosphere find references in blog entries to scientific articles on the web , they could resolve those to their most canonical forms : DOIs , PubMed records .
And they could make equivalences among those forms .
That way , conversation in the blogosophere about a scientific article , and scientific conversation about the same article , would tend to hang together and would be discoverable in the same contexts .
Why does this matter ?
Well , the marginalrevolution blog is influential , widely cited in the blogosphere .
The entry that cited the PLoS Medicine article was itself widely cited .
But the PLoS Medicine reaction to the article is not part of the blog conversation .
I had to work really hard to find it , and to include it here .
The conversation - tracking tools used by bloggers should discover scientific discourse related to a scientific article as easily as they discover blog discourse .
Conversely , the conversation - tracking tools used by scientists should discover blog discourse as readily as scientific discourse .
Public understanding of science would improve , and so would scientific understanding of the public .
UK troops numbers in Iraq will be cut to 2,500 by next spring
The city is dominated by militias and the police contains " murderous " and " corrupt " elements , the report added .
The whole purpose of the UK forces ' presence may be in question due to cuts , the Defence Committee suggested .
Defence secretary Des Browne said security forces in Basra had grown in ability during the past year .
Numbers at the Basra Air Station base are to be halved to 2,500 .
The local security forces in Basra have grown in confidence and ability throughout the year .
Des Browne , Defence Secretary
The report said : " The initial goal of UK forces in south eastern Iraq was to establish the security necessary for the development of representative political institutions and for economic reconstruction .
" Although progress has been made , this goal remains unfulfilled . "
It also suggested that the relative security of Basra did not mean that the root causes of violence had been tackled .
The report added : " There remain murderous , corrupt and militia - infiltrated elements within the police which must be rooted out as a matter of priority . "
It went on to speculate on the future role of UK forces in Iraq .
The report said : " If there is still a role for UK forces in Iraq , those forces must be capable of doing more than just protecting themselves at Basra Air Station .
Attacks continue
" If the reduction in numbers means they cannot do more than this , the entire UK presence in south eastern Iraq will be open to question . "
The report said the Iraqi Army had made significant progress but still required logistical support from the British .
MPs welcomed the reduction of attacks on UK forces since they pulled out of their last base in the city but pointed out that there had been no corresponding reduction in the number of attacks against civilians .
The report explained : " The relative security of Basra is said to owe more to the dominance of militias and criminal gangs , who are said to have achieved a fragile balance in the city , than to the success of the multinational and Iraqi security forces in tackling the root causes of the violence . "
It also warned that it was important not to overstate the success of the US troop surge in and around Baghdad , adding that it was still unclear whether recent improvements in the security situation would remain for the long term .
Overstretch
Furthermore , the committee expressed concerns over whether the Ministry of Defence budget would be able to complete the necessary amount of refurbishment work required to be carried out on British Army equipment .
The committee also said there was a discrepancy between the number of troops the Minister for Armed Forces said was needed to perform the ' overwatch role ' and the numbers given by the prime minister .
Bob Ainsworth said in July 2007 anything below 5,000 would be " difficult to sustain " .
But the prime minister announced in October 2007 that forces would be reduced to 2,500 from spring 2008 .
Mr Browne added that he was satisfied that on the basis of the evidence he had received the prime minister 's " figure of troops to tasks is the right figure . "
BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said the committee had been reassured the withdrawal was not due to overstretch and the need for more troops in Afghanistan .
General Peter Wall , at the MoD , had told the committee that " were more forces needed at this stage of the campaign , the army could provide additional forces " .
Defence Secretary Des Browne said : " We have always said that our obligations to the Iraqi nation will not end when all four provinces within our area of operations have been transferred to Iraqi control .
" The local security forces in Basra have grown in confidence and ability throughout the year . "
' Bodes well '
He added : " Under the leadership of Generals Mohan and Jalil , they have proved able to handle the occasional security incidents swiftly and effectively .
" These are positive indications which bode well for the prospect of transferring Basra province to Iraqi control by the end of the year - an ambition which is shared by our Coalition allies and by the Iraqi government . "
Mr Browne accepted that the Iraqi forces were " not the finished article " .
But he added : " Our commitment in this role is undiminished .
We will continue until the Iraqis themselves are confident they no longer need our assistance . "
The chairman of the committee , Conservative MP James Arbuthnot , said the handover should go ahead despite the violence .
" Development of the Iraqi army is going much better than the development of the Iraqi police and the army in Iraq is able I think , in the south eastern part anyway , to take over control from British forces , " he said .
" The trouble is the experience in every - day life terms of the Iraqi population in that area is largely experience of the police and we say they remain murderous , corrupt and infiltrated by militias and that 's a real worry . "
Resegregation of American schools is deepening Adam Doster
Published : Saturday January 26 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This School segregation is not an anachronistic trend , and in the wake of two Supreme Court decisions dismantling both mandated and voluntary integration programs , the problem is deepening .
According to new data released by Gary Orfield , codirector of the Civil Rights Project , about one - sixth of black students and one - ninth of Latino students attend what Orfield calls ' apartheid schools , ' institutions that teach at least 99 percent students of color .
In urban centers , black and Latino students are twice as likely to attend such schools .
The most segregated schools , according to the report , which documents desegregation trends , are in big cities of the Northeast and Midwest .
But even the South , a region that originally integrated most successfully , is beginning to resegregate .
" It 's getting to the point of almost absolute segregation in the worst of the segregated cities  within one or two percentage points of what the Old South used to be like , " says Orfield .
" The biggest metro areas are the epicenters of segregation .
It 's getting worse for both blacks and Latinos , and nothing is being done about it . "
Although resegregation has been taking place for some time , Orfield argues that the newest data is worrisome for the degree to which the trend is occurring .
It will also be more difficult for districts to address the problem , given the restrictions placed upon them by the courts .
" If you [ as a district ] are going to ask your lawyer what 's the easiest thing to do , it 's to just stop trying to do anything , " Orfield explains .
" That 's a recipe for real segregation . "
As the Christian Science Monitor reports , " segregated schools tend to be highly correlated with such things as school performance and the ability to attract teachers . "
" Once you separate kids spacially from more privileged kids , they tend to not get the same things , " says Amy Stuart Wells , an education professor at Columbia University 's Teachers College in New York .
" And we need to start thinking about how a school that 's racially isolated can be preparing students for this global society we live in . "
While urban schools remain racially divided , new minority migration into suburbs means there is a chance communities outside of the urban core could remain diverse .
The Civil Rights Project report noted that big-city suburbs educate 7.9 million white students along with 2.1 million blacks and 2.9 million Latinos .
However , it s unlikely that suburbs will remain racially balanced , as many communities are demonstrating emerging segregation patterns similar to those found in cities .

Four months into her pregnancy , Lorraine Allard was devastated to learn she was in the advanced stages of cancer .
Doctors advised her to have an abortion and start chemotherapy straight away .
Instead , with steadfast courage , she insisted on waiting long enough to give her unborn son a chance to survive , telling her husband Martyn : " If I am going to die , my baby is going to live . "
Scroll down for more ...
A caesarean delivery was scheduled at 26 weeks , but Mrs Allard went into premature labour a week before and Liam was born on November 18 .
She then started chemotherapy , but died on January 18 - having left her bed a handful of times to cuddle her son beside his incubator .
" Lorraine was positive all the way through - she had strength for both of us , " Mr Allard said yesterday .
" Towards the end we knew things were n't going well , but she was overjoyed that she had given life to Liam . "
The 34 - year - old oilfield technician from St Olaves , near Great Yarmouth , Norfolk , and his 33 - year - old wife already had three daughters - Leah , ten , Amy , eight , and Courtney , 20 months - when they learned they were expecting their first boy
Scroll down for more ...
" We were going to have the full set and did n't plan to have any more children after that , " said Mr Allard .
But in October last year , his wife started suffering stomach cramps and tests at James Paget Hospital in Gorleston revealed tumours on her liver .
It is believed the disease spread from bowel cancer that had been growing unnoticed for years .
" The doctors said they could n't do anything because she was pregnant , " said Mr Allard .
" She told them straight away they were not going to get rid of the baby .
She 'd have lost the will to fight . "
Scroll down for more ...
Mrs Allard went into labour a couple of weeks after the diagnosis and gave birth at the Norfolk and Norwich University NHS Hospital in Norwich .
" Liam was so tiny , just 1lb 11oz , so the nurse picked him up and allowed Lorraine to give him a little kiss before he was taken to an incubator , " said Mr Allard .
" She was so emotional .
She had been so determined to give him the best chance and was happy that he had been born naturally , which meant she would n't have to recover for a couple of weeks after a caesarean before beginning the chemotherapy . "
The treatment began almost immediately and Mrs Allard spent her time recuperating at home , apart from four visits to her newborn son .
The first was when he was two weeks old , during which a treasured photo of her cuddling him was taken .
Liam has responded well to his care and it is hoped he will be sent home from hospital in early March .
But his mother 's health started to deteriorate just before Christmas and a scan on January 17 revealed the tumours were still growing .
She died the following day .
Mr Allard said : " The doctors had said the cancer was no longer curable , although they were trying to shrink the tumours - which they thought might give her a couple of years .
" On the day Lorraine died , she had n't eaten for two weeks and could n't drink .
" I laid beside her and she was gripping my hand quite tight .
" We were like that for about half an hour .
I could feel against my chest that her heart was slowing down .
She just slipped away after that .
It was very peaceful .
" When Liam is old enough , I wo n't tell him that Lorraine gave her life for him , but I will say she made sure he had a good chance of life .
" She told me she did n't want him to feel bad about it . "
Scroll down for more ...
Mrs Allard 's father , Tom Berry , said : " I was overwhelmed by the way Lorraine took it .
" She lived for her husband and children .
She was a big personality with a heart of gold . "
Babies born at 25 weeks have a 50 per cent chance of survival .
This goes down to 39 per cent at 24 weeks and 17 per cent - or a one in six chance - at 23 weeks .
I ’ve spent a bit of time over the past few days putting together some LLVM bindings for Haskell , based on Gordon Henriksen ’s C bindings .
( If you do n’t know what LLVM is , it ’s a wonderful toybox of compiler components , from a complete toolchain supporting multiple architectures through a set of well - defined APIs and intermediate representation file formats that are designed for building interesting software . )
The C bindings are almost untyped , but the Haskell bindings re-add type safety to prevent runtime crashes and general badness .
Currently , almost the entire code generation system is implemented , with most LLVM data types supported ( notably absent are structs ) .
Also plugged in is JIT support , so you can generate code at runtime from Haskell and run it immediately .
I ’ve attached an example .
Please join in the hacking fun !
Here ’s the darcs repository :
darcs get http://darcs.serpentine.com/llvm
If you want a source tarball , fetch it from here for now .
Hackage ca n’t yet host code that uses GHC 6.8.2 ’s language extension names .
There ’s very light documentation at present , but it ought to be enough to get you going .
Here ’s a quick example of some code “ in the wild ” :
buildFib :: T.Module -> IO ( V.Function T.Int32 T.Int32 ) build Fib m = do let one = C.const ( 1:: Int32 ) two = C.const ( 2:: Int32 ) -- the compiler infers the type for the function from our signature ( fib , entry ) <- U.defineFunction m " fib " ( T.function undefined undefined ) -- a builder is an instruction emitter bld <- B.createBuilder exit <- Core.appendBasicBlock fib " return " recurse <- Core.appendBasicBlock fib " recurse " let arg = V.params fib -- make the builder emit instructions in the " entry " basic block B.positionAtEnd bld entry -- if our argument is less than two , exit , else recurse test <- B.icmp bld " " I.IntSLE arg two B.cond Br bld test exit recurse -- this is the exit basic block B.positionAtEnd bld exit B.ret bld one -- here 's the recursion case B.positionAtEnd bld recurse x1 <- B.sub bld " " arg one fibx1 <- B.call bld " " fib x1 x2 <- B.sub bld " " arg two fibx2 <- B.call bld " " fib x2 B.add bld " " fibx1 fibx2 >>=
B.ret bld -- hand the function definition back to our caller return fib
This emits a function definition that computes the Fibonacci series in LLVM assembly language .
Run it under a JIT :
main :: IO ( ) main = do args <- getArgs let args ' = if null args then [ " 10 " ] else args m <- Core.createModule " fib " fib <- build Fib m -- print the function definition to the screen V.dumpValue fib -- create a JIT prov <- Core.createModuleProviderForExistingModule m ee <- EE.createExecutionEngine prov -- evaluate the JITted fib function over every command line argument forM_ args ' $
um -> do putStr $ " fib " ++ num ++ " = " parm <- EE.createGeneric ( read num :: Int ) gv <- EE.runFunction ee fib [ parm ] print ( EE.fromGeneric gv :: Int )
Running this on the command line gives the following output :
This year , for the first time I have attempted to grow a meaningful amount of my own food , at least enough to store during the winter and supplement ( hopefully ) fewer trips to the grocery store .
I planted 38 (! ) heirloom tomato plants , which has proven to be a few too many .
I literally have had days with bushel baskets of tomatoes .
Some go to friends , many are dried , many are partially cooked in a solar oven , then frozen .
This post is not about tomatoes or solar ovens , but about paradigm shifts and tipping points .
It relates to a comment my Dad made .
First some background :
I go out in the morning and pick whatever tomatoes are ripe .
On sunny days , I wash and core the tomatoes , then quarter them .
In July , I wrote a post here about the Midwest Renewable Energy Fair , where I bought a Solar SOS oven .
I really like it , and use it most days either to cook a snack or blanche / prepare some produce for storage .
It can get to about 225 degrees and about 275 if you use the solar reflectors ( not shown here )
I then put the tomatoes in the pot , put a little olive oil on them and some oregano and italian seasoning , close the lid of the solar oven , point it towards the sun and rotate clockwise 30 degrees , and leave to do whatever else is on my agenda for the day .
Several hours later ( or as little as 2 hours ) , I return to juicy delicious tomato concoction , which I can eat with bread or such right then .
But lately , I 've been dumping the contents in freezer bags and throwing them in my ( energy star ) freezer , to remind me of summer during the long Wisconsin winter .
But heres the moral of this story .
My father is one of my favorite people , though politically and economically he hits it pretty straight down the fairway .
He 's a peak oil agnostic - though he does believe that oil is finite , he does n't think there will be meaningful supply problems in his lifetime ( on this we disagree ) .
He is a nature lover , and very knowledgeable about the natural world , though I suspect this is related to the deer and ducks he shoots .
He has always been a very hard worker - even if nothing really needs ' doing ' he will find a ' project ' of some sort to occupy his time , usually outdoors .
Though Ive thought
Ive gotten under his skin the past year or so - warning of peak oil , explaining how dependent our system is on liquid fuels , articulating how fragile the food transport economy is , etc. , perhaps there have been positive externalities from these talks .
He helped me build a decent sized garden this year , and we have been storing ( and eating ) from the garden for the past few months .
( Punchline ) Yesterday I was too busy to go use the solar oven .
At about 3 in the afternoon my father returned from some various outdoor chores and inquired ' Whats in the solar oven today , Nat ? "
I told him I had forgotten to put anything in it - that I was too busy .
His reply , ( the title of this post ) , was a vehement " What ?!!
You 've wasted a day of sunlight ! ! "
And you could tell from his expression that he actually felt this as a ' loss ' .
( It 's possible he was thinking that we'd now need to use the oven , which would cost money in KwH , as opposed to free sunlight )
After the initial shock and some chuckling , I thought a bit about this .
My father is old school .
For him to think in terms of ' energy ' as a currency to pay attention to , is important .
He is not in the peak oil crowd , but just a normal guy pursuing his lot .
It gave me renewed confidence in our collective ability to change , when I heard those terms meaningfully spoken , from someone who has worked hard his entire life but never viewed ' sunlight ' as something of value .
Today 's societal metric of success is pecuniary bigger and better stuff .
This metric was not one created overnight .
Our world has been morphed by a collection of baby steps , too small to notice day by day , but quite significant when they accumulate over decades .
So too , will the world of our children be created by such small steps .
The change to a biophysical economy will also be a long process .
To me , being chastised by my Dad that I wasted a day of sunlight , is a baby step in the right direction .
Im not suggesting that everyone be farmers .
But to change small aspects of our lives to be more in sync with natural systems is an improvement in our demand infrastructure that will add up over time .
These ‘ food chores ’ may appear wasteful to an economist .
My time , knowledge and experience should be able to provide more societal utility that would translate to monetary value for me and more resources to society as a whole via my comparative advantage .
Indeed , the amount of money I could make in the time it took me to procure one batch of tomatoes would probably be enough for me to have dried heirloom tomatoes to my door by federal express .
But I a ) enjoy spending my time this way , b) eat healthier unprocessed food , c ) have more opportunity to create social capital with neighbors and d ) have less opportunity to spend my time consuming other stuff ...
Had my Dad not been traveling today , perhaps he would have told me I wasted a day of rain ... ;)
Nicholas Gaubert has diabetes and lives in the United Kingdom .
A bad combination as he had to learn in July 2005 when he fall into a diabetic coma on a public bus .
Of course nobody noted and so he rode the bus until it drove back into the depot and the driver noticed him .
A few days before a couple of Islamic terrorists had blown themselves up in buses and subways .
So the tension was very high .
The driver just saw a gay sitting there with a backpack ( which the terrorists used to carry their bombs ) .
He ran off to call the police .
The police arrived at the scene and even they did not consider it could be a medical emergency despite the fact that Mr Gaubert was wearing a medical bracelet .
So the cops did the only thing cops seem to be good at : Taking their Tasers and tasered him while holding a gun to his head .
After that they arrested him and put him into a police van .
Inside the van they remembered that not everybody who sits on a bus with a backpack is a terrorist and realized he was in a bad medical condition .
Afterwards they claimed he looked Egyptian .
So being Egyptian on Public Transportation in Britain is probably a bad idea , too .
Wonders me that the Police Officers did not claimed they simply used their Tasers as Defibrillator .

Padilla is a former Chicago gang member of Puerto Rican descent
Padilla was held for three - and - a - half years as an " enemy combatant " after his arrest in 2002 on suspicion of plotting a radioactive " dirty bomb " attack .
That charge was dropped and his case was moved to a civilian court after pressure from civil liberties groups .
He says he was tortured in military detention but officials deny this .
His mother told the BBC that this had been a " political case " .
Padilla faced life in prison after his conviction in August .
Two other men , Lebanese - born Palestinian Adham Amin Hassoun and Jordanian - born Kifah Wael Jayyousi , were convicted on the same counts and sentenced to 15 years and eight months , and 12 years and eight months respectively .
The three defendants all denied the charges against them but , after a three - month trial in Miami , jurors took only a day - and - a - half to find them guilty .
' Harsh conditions '
In sentencing Padilla to 208 months in prison , US district court Judge Marcia Cooke said she had given the 37 - year - old some credit for his detention as an enemy combatant following his arrest in May 2002 after returning from Pakistan .
JOSE PADILLA Born to Puerto Rican parents in New York , moved to Chicago when 4 Involved in gang crime as a youth , jailed in 1991 Brought up a Catholic , thought to have converted to Islam in jail Alleged to have learned bomb - making with al - Qaeda in Pakistan
Profile : Jose Padilla
Judge Cooke said she agreed with Padilla 's lawyers that he had been subjected to " harsh conditions " and " extreme environmental stresses " at a Navy jail in South Carolina and that this warranted consideration .
The judge also dismissed prosecutors ' claims that Padilla and his two co-defendants had done any more than conspire to murder , kidnap and maim , and provide material support for terrorism .
" There is no evidence that these defendants personally maimed , kidnapped or killed anyone in the United States or elsewhere , " she said .
The chief evidence presented against Padilla at last year 's trial was what the prosecution called an al - Qaeda application form bearing his fingerprints and date of birth that was found in Afghanistan .
FBI recordings of telephone conversations in Arabic between the defendants were also produced , containing , according to the prosecution , coded references to terrorist activity .
Their defence lawyers argued that the three men had links with countries such as Afghanistan , Bosnia and Chechnya because they had been involved in humanitarian aid for Muslims and said the charges against them were exaggerated .
Appeal hope
Padilla 's mother , Estela Ortega Lebron , said she was relieved that the sentence was not harsher .
Estela Ortega Lebron says she was relieved at the sentence
" You have to understand that the government was asking for 30 years to life sentence in prison , " she told the BBC's Warren Bull in Miami .
" We have a chance to appeal , and in the appeal we 're gonna do better . "
While Jose Padilla faces 17 more years in prison , his mother says she is determined not to give up his case :
" This is not about Jose Padilla .
This is a political case , " said Mrs Ortega .
" I know that justice is going to be done on my son 's behalf one of these days .
It might not come today but it will come , believe me , it will . "
I Hung Out at Liz Brooks 's Apartment
The weekend started with my weekly trip home to work at the store as usual , but I had to rush home Saturday night to attend a murder mystery dinner party .
Then on Sunday , I have my last softball games of the year , the last hurrah .
I did n't want to have to go home Saturday late at night and then have to schlep back into the city bright and early the next morning .
I had to leave my apartment at 8:15 am to make a 9:30 game the week before since you have to switch trains on weekends so I was hoping not to have to do that again .
Liz ( of the I hang out with Liz Brooks fame ) was gracious enough to let me crash at her apartment on Saturday night .
She gave me her keys at the murder mystery party .
Her mistake was leaving me in her apartment unchaperoned .
It turned out my game was moved to 1:30 pm so I had the morning to kill .
I went to my games , had obligatory post - game dim sum , and did n't meander back to the apartment until around 7:00 pm .
Tin foiling her apartment was actually Plan C. Due to circumstances I wo n't mention , Plan A and Plan B were scrapped in favor of Plan C ( it 's good to have contingency plans ) .
I went next door to ask her friends / neighbors if they had a camera that I could possibly borrow later .
I walked back from the murder mystery dinner with them so I could get in the building .
I had already explained to them on the walk over that I 'm probably going to do something to Liz 's apartment before I leave since she was foolish enough to leave me there by myself for extended periods of time .
They said they had a camera and can't wait .
I did n't tell them what I was up to , but it 's always nice to have the blessing of her landlords when you embark on something like this .
Now , foiling is n't exactly a novel prank .
However , I might be the only one persistent enough to attempt it myself without a crew .
!!!
*** NOTE : A WEEK + LATER , LIZ IS FINALLY HOME ! *** !!!
!!!
*** YOU CAN ALL COME OUT FROM BEHIND THE BUSHES TO POINT AND LAUGH NOW *** !!!
Since I 'm a wrecking crew of one , I figured I could only manage to finish one room .
I debated between the living room and the kitchen before deciding on the living room .
Liz wo n't really miss her kitchen , but she NEEDS her tv !
I surveyed the living room with all the things I had to foil , then decided it 's best to just not think about it and get to work .
It 's going to be a long night and I need to mentally prepare to last .
I have to foil a living room by myself .
Getting discouraged will be my nemesis .
If I start fretting over an item or the daunting task of what else is left to foil , I 'll never finish .
When in doubt , move on to the next item .
Just when I started foiling , my phone buzzed .
It was Liz .
I had called her earlier wondering what I should do with her keys , but she did n't answer .
I guess she was calling me back .
I can't answer her call now that I 'm in the midst of desecrating her living room !
It 's a good thing I do n't pick up my phone anyway .
She 'll think nothing of it .
I quickly learned how difficult tin foiling was .
Long flat surfaces are deceptively hard .
You think because the surface is smooth , you can just cover it , but foil does n't adhere to vertical walls .
Every item was like its own annoying puzzle .
All you have is a roll of foil to work with , a set width and somewhat unlimited length .
I know what you 're thinking -- just tape it on , no big deal .
THAT'S CHEATING !
I have principles dammit .
Besides , it would be wrong to leave sticky tape residue all over someone else 's stuff .
Eventually the dim sum wore off and I was starving .
I could see a Wendy 's and a Taco Bell / Pizza Hut outside the window .
They called my name and their signs shined brightly in the dark night .
Oh how I desperately wanted to answer their calls , but I knew I could n't leave or I 'd lose foiling momentum .
Finally , I went over the kitchen to see what time it was .
The microwave read 3:00 .
Damn , I need to get the hell out of here already .
I sped up the pace and eventually ran out of foil .
I missed the boxes on the side of the room , a shelf , and the hat painting but at 3:00 am and out of foil , I 'm ready to call it a night .
Besides , the room was shining radiantly already .
I am a bit mad at myself for not foiling the hat painting .
Problem was , I had already foiled the couch .
With the painting being so large and the couch off limits , it was now out of reach .
I can't even go back to foil it .
Since it was too late to go next door to borrow the camera , I decided I 'll go home and come back tomorrow with my own camera to take pictures .
I packed up to head out , but was greeted by the loudest creaking door ever .
Given how late it was , I panicked and pulled the door to make it close faster but it only creaked even louder .
Here I was trying to sneak out , but probably woke up the neighborhood instead .
As I waited at the Path station for my train home , I noticed all the clocks in the station said 2:34 am .
SON OF A .... Liz never changed her clock to fall back !
Dammit , the night was till young .
Having gotten home really late since the trains only run every half hour in the wee hours of the morning , I lingered around at home dreading having to go back in the city .
I told a few people of my late night escapade and they were clamoring for pictures , which I still do n't have .
Around 5:00 pm , I was still sitting at home in Hoboken and I told the peanut gallery that with every passing minute , I 'm losing my motivation to go back in the city .
It turned into an online pep rally or something .
Next thing I know , I 'm eating dinner and packing for another extended night of foiling at Liz 's apartment .
They wanted me to foil the desk and her bathroom too .
" But you 've come so far , " they said .
" Do n't stop now .
Keep going ! "
Again , with the limitations of a one man wrecking crew , I could only get so much done on my own .
I picked the bathroom .
They demanded updates and a live webcast of my activities .
I said if I could find her webcam , I will see what I can do .
I realize there must be something wrong with me having spent six hours foiling the previous night to go back for more .
Not only is it really tedious , but I 'll now be stuck in the confines of a bathroom for hours on end .
On top of it all , I had already foiled the couch so if I were to even sleep at all , I 'd have to sleep on the floor .
Yet , they were right .
I have come so far .
A good scheme requires sacrifices to be made for the bonus laughs .
It 'll be a long night of going nowhere that 's ideal for the makings of a Snickers commercial .
I 'm packing my brother 's good headphones .
With a replenished supply of foils , I went back to the living room to finish the boxes and the shelf of miscellaneous items that I missed the previous night .
I pulled stuff out of the shelf and started foiling .
I started thinking what sort of food items might be in all these little foil pouches I 'm making if I were to put them in an oven .
A potato or a pie perhaps ?
Do you put pies in foil pouches ?
Would n't it be nice if you could put a pizza in here ?
Wait , a pizza can go directly in the oven without a foil pouch .
Mmmmm ... pizza .
I think I 'm hungry .
* Stand up to look outside the window *
Wendy , you red - headed stepchild !
I can see you taunting me !
Curse you , pigtailed girl !
Curse you !
My food daydream got interrupted when I got to a small cylindrical glass item .
I was about to start wrapping when I noticed stuff inside .
" What 's this ? "
I thought as I picked one up .
EWWWW !
It 's an ashtray !
Those are smoked ciggie butts !
Well ... I guess they 're going to have to each get wrapped individually too .
I definitely did n't prepare for this when I left my apartment for Round 2 , but then I just started laughing .
We used to joke that our friendship is based on our mutual unwilligness to go whale watching with each other in the rain .
I can't help but think foiling someone 's used cigarette butts has to constitute as some new deranged form of measuring your friendship .
In those dire times when you need to reach deep for a favor , you 'd say , " Dude , but I 'm willing to wrap your smoked cigs in tin foil for you ! "
It 's like taking a bullet for someone , but completely impractical and senseless to begin with .
Having completed the living room minus the Mr. Hat painting ( grrrrr ... ) , I moved on to the bathroom .
It had its own set of challenges , particularly pliable cotton towels and bathrobe .
I suddenly flashbacked to my engineering orientation class from freshman year .
Engineers solve problems .
That 's what they ingrained into our young minds .
These are all problems .
Figure it out !
Yes , I 'm glad I got an engineering degree so I can work on solving the finer problems in life , like how to foil a bathrobe .
Oh , my professors would be so proud .
Next , it was on to the shower .
I removed the showerhead from the hook to let it hang so I could have two free hands to foil the shower cable .
It was n't even halfway down when jets of water nailed me directly in the head and torso .
I jumped back a bit freaked because I thought I accidentally turned the shower on , but the water stopped almost as immediately as it started .
I realized it 's because the showerhead is now below the faucet point so it was the leftover water in the system coming out .
Dammit !
Oh , would n't you know ?
The towels are already foiled .
I did n't pack a change of clothes either because I did n't really plan on sleeping .
Now not only do I have to spend many hours in someone 's bathroom , but spend it drenched !
I hate myself .
I foiled until 5:30 am , but still a lot to go .
I had watched Taco Bell / Pizza
Hut take out their trash and turn their lights off .
I 'm ignoring Wendy 's because we 're in a fight , but she does n't know it yet .
I grabbed my camera and snapped some pictures .
Then I hopped on her laptop to write an email update to the peanut gallery with with the photos I had promised .
I could n't but feel guilty that I 'm using her computer to provide photos of her tin foiled apartment .
It 's like adding salt to injury .
I do n't even have to go home to send people these pictures .
After sending out the email , I decided I was out of gas and needed a nap .
I knew Liz was going back to Boston on Wednesday , thanks to insider information from her sister .
That means if she needed stuff before she leaves , she might possibly be back today so I needed to finish .
I crashed on the floor for a quick nap with plans on getting up at 9 to finish up .
I slept for a bit , then got up to check the time .
It 's 9:03 so time to restart the day .
I hopped back on the computer to see if Liz was online so I could ask her what she wanted me to do with her keys .
I noticed the computer said it was 8:06 .
GODDAMMIT , I FELL FOR HER MICROWAVE CLOCK AGAIN !
Great , that means I only got two hours of sleep in .
I tried to nap again , but just could n't anymore .
Native Americans used to listen to the ground to track buffalos and apparently such techniques are still good for tracking the neighbor 's kid throwing tantrums .
I hopped back on the computer and saw that Liz was online so I messaged her to ask what she wanted me to do with her keys and if she was coming back to her apartment today so that I can be sure to have her keys back in time ( read : so I know when I need to flee the scene of the crime ) .
She said if it 's not a problem , I could drop it off with her doorman .
Haha , not a problem at all !
I 'll just drop it off on the way out !
She had no idea I spent another night in her apartment and that I 'm really chatting with her from her computer .
Then I got disconnected and could n't reconnect , probably because her entire living room is now one big interference with the wifi signal .
I went back to work on the bathroom .
After more work on the bathroom , I went to snap off more pictures to update the peanut gallery .
I got back online and sure enough , Liz asked , " Where did you go before ?
Hiding from UFOs ? "
Ha !
Oops .
My computer in Hoboken is on and my away message there says " I 'm hiding where the UFOs can't find me " , meaning her apartment .
So when I got disconnected from her apartment , all messages get re-routed to my computer in Hoboken so she gets that away message .
I told her I got disconnected and could n't reconnect so I stepped away from the computer ( which was true ) .
Then I tried to ferret out information on her plans for the day to see if she was coming home sometime today .
When I learned she was not , it was a huge sigh of relief .
I can take my time to finish now .
Then I noticed she was having connection issues so I offered to go over to fix her network problem and give her back her keys in person .
She said she 'd love it but did n't want me to have to go all the way up there just to do that .
I said , " No , I insist !
I owe you ( at least ) one . "
I 've gone out of my way to hang out with her toilet all night and to sleep on the floor .
I think I can manage a little trip uptown for a network housecall .
I think spending multiple hours holed up in her bathroom bonding with her toilet also constitute as some new level of friendship building .
I can't believe I spent that many hours inside a bathroom , and none of it constituted a shower .
I could n't wait to go home to shower .
I warned Liz to pardon my appearance .
It 's been a rough morning .
I cleaned up her apartment and took my time to simulate the time needed to travel from my apartment in Hoboken into the city .
Meredith asked if I was hungry and I think I answered something like , " I am , but I just want to go home and shower . "
I realized I did n't really answer her question , but I am running on fumes and have n't eaten since 5 last night .
Anything out of my mouth may not make sense at this point .
A bit out of it , but I was still together enough to fix the network problem relatively quickly .
I had lent her my spare router before so she gave it back since everything seems working now .
I could n't squeeze the router back in my bag because of all the crap I had with me .
They were wondering what the hell is in my bag .
I started taking stuff out to rearrange my bag so I had room to fit the router .
Taking up the most room is my brother 's headphones .
It comes with a giant wooden box .
Also taking up a lot of space are the amplifier for the headphones and my overnight lunchbox .
I think I 've explained to her my overnight lunchbox so she SHOULD have known when she saw it that I spent the night somewhere .
They could n't quite understand why I had headphones in a wooden box and an amplifier for headphones .
" Seems like a lot of work , " she said .
" Do n't you have smaller ones you could bring ? " I said , " Yeah , the smaller ones are in the front of my bag . "
That just confused them more .
I added , " Yeah , you do n't want to know where I was .
I 'm just going to go home now and shower . "
I walked back down to the 33rd St Path station .
One of the Port Authority cops pointed at me and said , " Can we check your bag , please ? "
RAWR !
Of all days to get randomly screened !
Come on , I have a big ass bag but I hardly fit the racial profile of terrorist .
So I walked over to the table and plunked my bag down .
Having just carefully rearranged it earlier , I must now watch the cop undo my handiwork .
He took everything out and examined it while asking me to explain what they are .
My loaded bag o stuff
Cop : " Is this for wireless ? "
Me : " Yeah , it 's a router . "
Cop : " What is this thing ? ? "
Me : " A headphone amplifier . "
Cop : " Really ?
It 's pretty big and heavy to be an amplifier for headphones . "
Me : " Yeah , they 're big headphones . "
Cop : " I do n't even want to know what this is . "
Me : " The big headphones . "
Cop : " In this big wooden box ? "
Me : " Yeah , that 's their carrying case .
You can open it .
They really are just headphones . "
Cop : " * shakes box *
Okay .
Tin foil ... Lunchbox ?
Me : " Toothbrush , contacts , and the likes . "
Cop : " May I ask what you 're doing with all this stuff ? "
Stuff in the front pocket
Stuff in the back pocket
I thought about all the random stuff in my bag -- giant headphones in a wooden box , headphone amplifier , a lunchbox full of overnight essential , rolls of tin foil , camera , and a wireless router .
You would n't go through the hassle of bringing headphones in a giant wooden box and using amplifiers with them unless you planned on listening to music for a long time .
The funny thing is , there really is no better explaination so I told him the truth .
I was packing to be comfortable for a really long night of tin foiling my friend 's apartment .
He laughed and thought it was hilarious .
I was free to go .
Of course , he could n't fit everything back in my bag to zip it so I had to take everything back out again and re-pack the bag for the third time .
I walked through the turnstyles and headed for the Hoboken bound train , but was confused at the sight of the Jersey City train on the other track .
" That 's weird , " I thought to myself .
" They 're running the lines separately again now ?
I thought we get packed like cows on weekends . "
Then I realized it 's not Sunday .
In fact , it 's Tuesday so the trains are running on weekday schedules .
I 'm only two whole days off .
It 's been a long weekend .

What was Liz 's reaction ?
At 5:15 pm EST on November 29 , 2007 , I received the following email from Liz :
subject : habitat
message : YOU R DEAD !
Details of Liz 's reaction is documented in Part 2 .
How many rolls of tin foil did you go through ?
Six rolls of 50 ft and 4 rolls of 75 ft .
How long did it take you ?
Round 1 = 6 hours .
Round 2 = ~ 10 + hours .
I slowed down and lost track of time once I found out she was n't coming back yet .
What 's that can ?
Ashtray with smoked cigs .
What 's on the back of the door ?
Bathrobe .
Why did n't you sleep on the bed ?
Sleepovers are for couches and floors .
Besides , I was a soaked mess after the shower incident .
It 'd be just wrong .
Let me get this straight , she was nice enough to let you stay there .... and you tinfoiled her house ?!
Yes .
My friendship is an acquired taste .
Moral of the Story :
Do n't leave me alone in your apartment with keys for extended periods of time .

Underscoring a major susceptibility threatening thousands of high - profile computer users across the world , a Swedish security consultant has published login credentials belonging to some 100 embassies .
The list contains the login credentials for official email addresses belonging to some 100 foreign embassies from countries including Russia , India , Japan and Iran .
They are used to conduct official , sometimes confidential business , from sending ambassadors ' schedules to transmitting information relating to lost passports .
The consultant , Dan Egerstad , says the list is only part of a much bigger problem that allowed him to gain credentials for more than 1,000 email accounts around the world , including at least one belonging to an employee of a company that generates more than $ 10bn in annual revenue .
He declined to offer specific details for fear they would be misused by criminals .
" It will only take 10 minutes and every script kiddie is going to be using the exact same method , " he told The Reg .
" I 'm probably not the first one grabbing these passwords , but I 'm absolutely the first one publishing them . "
Egerstad said he was able to get the information because users of the accounts were misusing a common security application in a way that allowed him to perform a man - in - the - middle attack .
He declined to give further details , other than to say its a client application and that the vendor has offered ample warnings to customers not to use the program in a certain way that makes them vulnerable to the attack .
Anyone with a clue what the misused app may be , please email your author using the above link .
Most of the embassies on the list belonged to countries in Asia , the middle east and Eastern Europe .
We were n't willing to risk getting a one - way ticket to the gulag , so we have n't actually validated the authenticity of the credentials by trying to log in to an account .
Alas , it appears a reporter from The Indian Express was braver .
According to this article , a reporter sent an email to the official address of India 's ambassador in China and then logged in and read it .
The reporter also claims to have found other emails , including one containing a transcript of a recent meeting between a senior Indian official and the Chinese foreign minister .
Others contained phone numbers , commercial documents , official correspondence and personal messages .
Egerstad 's list offers a rare glimpse into the password robustness , or lack thereof , of various countries .
At the top of the list was Uzbekistan , where a typical password looks something like " s1e7u0l7 c . "
Surprisingly , the ultra-secret Iran was near the bottom of the list ; passwords for its various embassies tended to be the city or country in which the embassy resides .
The Hong Kong Liberal Party used " 12345678 " while one for an Indian embassy was simply " 1234 . "
Egerstad 's decision to publish the account details online is sure to reignite the frequent debate about whether such full disclosure is irresponsible because it simply allows a broader base of people to misuse the information .
He says he 's well versed in the merits of responsible disclosure but decided that posting the login details was the only way to get the attention this problem deserves .
" I do n't have time calling all over the world to tell them something they wo n't understand or listen to , " Egerstad said .
" I 'm probably going to get charged for helping to commit a crime .
I do n't really care . " ®
When was the last time you were amazed by a touch screen or touchpad that recognizes multiple simultaneous touch points .
Its no magic , but the attributes of Multitouch which uses a software to interpret simultaneous touches .
Elaborately speaking , Multi - touch is a human - computer interaction technique , which is implemented by the hardware devices which can frequently include the position and pressure of each touch point independently .
The journey of MultiTouch since its beginning in the year 1982 , which initiated with multi- touch tablets and multi - touch screens , have since been extemely successful and fulfilling in terms of the technological revolution it has brought about .
Making a humble yet firm beginning in 2005 with the first commercially successful professional multi-media controller ‘ Lemur Input Device ’ with display using multi- touch technology , Multitouch has indeed come a long way since then .
With more innovation in the anvil , Multitouch technology has been widely accepted and its implemention in devices featuring multi- touch with more varied finger gesture options , such as in Microsoft ’s Surface technology , Apple ’s iPod touch and MacBook Air says it all .
Apple is strategising its integration in future versions of MacBook and MacBook Pro notebooks too .
Technology experts believe that the year 2008 might be a turning point for Multitouch .
Just as Apple completely transformed our vision of Multitouch technology with its breakthrough implementation in iPhone , there are indications that MacBook Pro is also set to get a of multitouch trackpad very soon .
Apple ’s latest report on Multitouch indicates the integration of the same multi touch trackpad as the one on the MacBook Air in the next version of MacBook Pro. Reports also mention the viability of the new MacBook Pro in comparison to its predecessors ; where the new portables will be based on Intel ’s latest Penryn processors , which besides enhancing performance will also increase its battery life .
The media is also enlightened with technology reports indicating N - trig ’s Multitouch Capabilities .
N- trig , the provider of DuoSense™ technology is reported to have demonstrated its multitouch capabilities and hopefully will have it for OEM integration in DuoSense™ in May , 2008 .
Now , what is it that makes people ‘ wow ’ at Multitouch ?
Most probably , it is the simplicity of technology and the new dimension of enhancing touch usability it has offered to users in interacting with the computer , that has added to it popularity .
Just as N - trig refers to Multitouch as capacitive touch and not resistive touch , thereby , enabling the best touch experience in any input device for the personal computing industry .
Coyotes attack dogs in Golden Gate Park

San Francisco officials posted warnings in Golden Gate Park on Sunday after the first known coyote attack in the city in decades , when a pair of the wild canines charged two leashed dogs on a small path in the park .
" We 're taking this very seriously , " said Deb Campbell , spokeswoman for the San Francisco Animal Care and Control Department .
" We have officers looking for the coyotes , and we are letting the public know about these coyotes . "
The attack occurred about 9 a.m. Saturday , when a woman was walking her two large dogs along a path just south of Speedway Meadow near a large pile of mulch .
Two coyotes bit one of her dogs , leaving it with minor injuries , and lunged at the other , according to animal control officials .
Animal control officers were patrolling the park after the attack , posting signs on Sunday that alerted walkers , runners and cyclists about " coyote activity " near Speedway Meadow .
On Sunday , a female dog - walker said two coyotes followed her in the same area , authorities said .
Many of the people walking dogs in Golden Gate Park on Sunday were surprised to hear about the coyotes .
" I know there are coyotes in the Oakland hills , but how did they get to Golden Gate Park ? " asked Joe Contreras of Oakland as he walked his Chihuahua near Stow Lake .
" I wonder if we 'll ever see them at Lake Merritt . "
The California Department of Fish and Game will assist local officials in an effort to find the animals and determine how much they threaten public safety .
Jamie Ray , director of the San Francisco Rescued Orphan Mammal Program , has studied the city 's coyote population since the animals returned to San Francisco a few years ago .
She said coyote attacks on humans or dogs are rare .
Generally , coyotes prefer to hunt small rodents such as squirrels , rabbits , rats and mice , said Ray .
But in Saturday 's attack , the coyote bit a Rhodesian ridgeback , a large type of dog that can weigh more than 100 pounds and was originally bred to hunt lions .
" There 's no way that a coyote would try to eat a ridgeback , " Ray said .
" They are so timid .
If you give them five seconds , they will usually run . "
Campbell agreed : " We thought if we saw a coyote attack a dog , it would be a little one like a Chihuahua because ( coyotes ) do n't tend to go after large prey . "
Ray speculated that the coyotes in Golden Gate Park were a breeding pair and that Saturday 's attack may have been an effort to protect their young .
" This might have been a defensive measure " because the dogs got too close to a den with coyote pups , Ray said .
City officials and wildlife researchers estimate that about five to eight coyotes live in San Francisco .
These include at least two in Golden Gate Park and one on Bernal Hill .
There have also been sightings in McLaren Park , Lake Merced and the Presidio .
Wildlife experts believe that human activity drove coyotes out of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake , as more people began settling in the western portions of the city .
But coyotes were spotted in the Presidio about seven years ago .
Researchers believe that coyotes , which can travel up to 45 miles in a day , returned to the city by traveling up the shoreline from undeveloped parts of San Mateo County along Ocean Beach .
Researchers tracked the movements of a coyote in the Presidio with an electronic device and said it traveled to the Daly City area and back in one day .
The San Francisco sightings come as coyotes , which tend to hunt in the evening and early morning , have successfully adapted to human habitation and spread into undeveloped areas adjacent to cities and suburbs .
When Europeans settled America in the 17th century , coyotes were found mostly in the western United States .
But in recent decades they have spread all the way to the East Coast and have infiltrated many major cities .
In April , a coyote attacked a toddler in New Jersey .
In the past year , there have been sightings in Detroit and Chicago .
And , since 2004 , coyotes have lived in Washington , D.C. 's Rock Creek Park , only a couple miles from the White House , according to the National Park Service .
Last year , authorities in New York City chased a coyote through Central Park for two days before catching it .
In Golden Gate Park on Sunday , Hector Bravo brought his wife , their three small children and the family Chihuahua on a daylong trip to the park from their home in Turlock ( Stanislaus County ) .
" We walked all the way from the ocean to ( Speedway ) Meadow and picnicked in a remote area , " said Bravo , as he pushed a stroller with his 7 - month - old daughter .
" Where we live , coyotes are all over , but I never expected to see them in San Francisco . "
Gene Simone , who lives just north of the park , said he has seen the coyotes many times and has never felt concerned .
He walks his schnauzer nearly every day near Stow Lake and Speedway Meadow .
" My dog has chased them , and they run away , " Simone said .
" They are really shy animals .
I started seeing them about three years ago .
I think they are beautiful .
But you can't get within 20 feet of them .
I 'm stunned they would attack a dog .
I hope ( park officials ) do n't drive them out of the park . "

The Yellowstone " supervolcano " rose at a record rate since mid-2004 , likely because a Los Angeles - sized , pancake - shaped blob of molten rock was injected 6 miles beneath the slumbering giant , University of Utah scientists report in the journal Science .
" There is no evidence of an imminent volcanic eruption or hydrothermal explosion .
That 's the bottom line , " says seismologist Robert B. Smith , lead author of the study and professor of geophysics at the University of Utah .
" A lot of calderas [ giant volcanic craters ] worldwide go up and down over decades without erupting . "
The upward movement of the Yellowstone caldera floor -- almost 3 inches ( 7 centimeters ) per year for the past three years -- is more than three times greater than ever observed since such measurements began in 1923 , says the study in the Nov. 9 issue of Science by Smith , geophysics postdoctoral associate Wu-Lung Chang and colleagues .
" Our best evidence is that the crustal magma chamber is filling with molten rock , " Smith says .
" But we have no idea how long this process goes on before there either is an eruption or the inflow of molten rock stops and the caldera deflates again , " he adds .
The magma chamber beneath Yellowstone National Park is a not a chamber of molten rock , but a sponge - like body with molten rock between areas of hot , solid rock .
Chang , the study 's first author , says : " To say if there will be a magma [ molten rock ] eruption or hydrothermal [ hot water ] eruption , we need more independent data . "
Calderas such as Yellowstone , California 's Long Valley ( site of the Mammoth Lakes ski area ) and Italy 's Campi Flegrei ( near Naples ) huff upward and puff downward repeatedly for decades to tens of thousands of years without catastrophic eruptions .

Smith and Chang conducted the study with University of Utah geophysics doctoral students Jamie M. Farrell and Christine Puskas , and with geophysicist Charles Wicks , of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park , Calif .
Yellowstone : A Gigantic Volcano Atop a Hotspot
Yellowstone is North America 's largest volcanic field , produced by a " hotspot " -- a gigantic plume of hot and molten rock -- that begins at least 400 miles beneath Earth 's surface and rises to 30 miles underground , where it widens to about 300 miles across .
There , blobs of magma or molten rock occasionally break off from the top of the plume , and rise farther , resupplying the magma chamber beneath the Yellowstone caldera .
Previous research indicates the magma chamber begins about 5 miles beneath Yellowstone and extends down to a depth of at least 10 miles .
Its heat powers Yellowstone 's geysers and hot springs -- the world 's largest hydrothermal field .
As Earth 's crust moved southwest over the Yellowstone hotspot during the past 16.5 million years , it produced more than 140 cataclysmic explosions known as caldera eruptions , the largest but rarest volcanic eruptions known .
Remnants of ancient calderas reveal the eruptions began at the Oregon - Idaho - Nevada border some 16.5 million years ago , then moved progressively northeast across what is now the Snake River Plain .
advertisement
The hotspot arrived under the Yellowstone area sometime after about 4 million years ago , producing gargantuan eruptions there 2 million , 1.3 million and 642,000 years ago .
These eruptions were 2,500 , 280 and 1,000 times bigger , respectively , than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens .
The eruptions covered as much as half the continental United States with inches to feet of volcanic ash .
The most recent giant eruption created the 40 - mile - by - 25 - mile oval - shaped Yellowstone caldera .
The caldera walls have eroded away in many areas -- although they remain visible in the northwest portion of the park .
Yellowstone Lake sits roughly half inside and half outside the eroded caldera .
Many smaller volcanic eruptions occurred at Yellowstone between and since the three big blasts , most recently 70,000 years ago .
Smaller steam and hot water explosions have been more frequent and more recent .
Measuring a Volcano Getting Pumped Up
In the new study , the scientists measured uplift of the Yellowstone caldera from July 2004 through the end of 2006 with two techniques :
Twelve Global Positioning System ( GPS ) ground stations that receive timed signals from satellites , making it possible to measure ground uplift precisely .
The European Space Agency 's Envisat satellite , which bounces radar waves off the Yellowstone caldera 's floor , another way to measure elevation change .
The measurements showed that from mid-2004 through 2006 , the Yellowstone caldera floor rose as fast as 2.8 inches ( 7 centimeters ) per year -- and by a total of 7 inches ( 18 centimeters ) during the 30 - month period , Chang says .
" The uplift is still going on today but at a little slower rate , " says Smith , adding there is no way to know when it will stop .
Smith says the fastest rate of uplift previously observed at Yellowstone was about 0.8 inch ( 2 centimeters ) per year between 1976 and 1985 .
He says that Yellowstone 's recent upward motion may seem small , but is twice as fast as the average rate of horizontal movement along California 's San Andreas fault .
The current uplift is faster than ever observed at Yellowstone , but may not be the fastest ever , since humans were n't around for its three supervolcano eruptions .
Chang , Smith and colleagues conducted computer simulations to determine what changes in shape of the underground magma chamber best explained the recent uplift .
The simulations or " modeling " suggested the molten rock injected since mid-2004 is a nearly horizontal slab -- known to geologists as a sill -- that rests about 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) beneath Yellowstone National Park .
The slab sits within and near the top of the pre-existing magma chamber , which resembles two anvil - shaped blobs expanding upward from a common base .
Smith describes the slab 's computer - simulated shape as " kind of like a mattress " about 38 miles long and 12 miles wide , but only tens or hundreds of yards thick .
In reality , he believes the slab resembles a large , spongy pancake formed as molten rock injected from below spread out near the top of the magma chamber .
The pancake of molten rock has an area of about 463 square miles , compared with 469 square miles of land for the City of Los Angeles .
Smith and colleagues believe steam and hot water contribute to uplift of the Yellowstone caldera , particularly during some previous episodes , but evidence indicates molten rock is responsible for most of the current uplift .
Chang says that when rising molten rock reaches the top of the magma chamber , it starts to crystallize and solidify , releasing hot water and gases , pressuring the magma chamber .
But gases and steam compress more easily than molten rock , so much greater volumes would be required to explain the volcano 's inflation , the researchers say .
Also , large volumes of steam and hot water usually are no deeper than 2 miles , so they are unlikely to be inflating the magma chamber 6 miles underground , Smith adds .
Ups and Downs at Yellowstone
Conventional surveying of Yellowstone began in 1923 .
Measurements showed the caldera floor rose 40 inches during 1923 - 1984 , and then fell 8 inches during 1985 - 1995 .
GPS data showed the Yellowstone caldera floor sank 4.4 inches during 1987 - 1995 .
From 1995 to 2000 , the caldera rose again , but the uplift was greatest -- 3 inches -- at Norris Geyser Basin , just outside the caldera 's northwest rim .
During 2000 - 2003 , the northwest area rose another 1.4 inches , but the caldera floor itself sank about 1.1 inches .
The trend continued during the first half of 2004 .
Then , in July 2004 , the caldera floor began its rapid rate of uplift , followed three months later by sinking of the Norris area that continued until mid-2006 .
Smith believes that uplift of the middle of the caldera decreased pressure within rocks along the edges of the giant crater , " so it allowed fluids to flow into the area of increased porosity . "
That , in turn , triggered small earthquakes along the edge of the " pancake " of magma .
The amount of hot water flowing out of the deflated Norris area is much smaller than the volume of magma injected beneath the caldera , Smith says .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation , the U.S. Geological Survey and the Brinson Foundation .
Toshiba , unwilling to concede defeat in the next - generation - DVD battle , said Monday that it would launch an aggressive advertising campaign to promote its HD DVD players and slash prices about 50 % .
Entry - level players now start at about $ 150 , down from about $ 300 .
The consumer electronics maker said in a statement that it would step up marketing of the players .
It provided few details but said the ads would run on television , in print and online .
Toshiba made the move in response to a series of victories by a rival format , Sony - backed Blu-ray .
The battle between HD DVD and Blu-ray is similar to the VHS - Betamax fight of the 1980s .
Earlier this month , Hollywood giant Warner Bros. said it would release its films only on Blu-ray discs .
It had previously supported both formats .
" The HD camp is doubling down , " says tech analyst Roger Kay at Endpoint Technologies Associates .
" Toshiba has to sell as many as they can … to populate the world with HD DVD players and maybe win back the studios . "
Both HD DVD and Blu-ray can display higher - quality video than traditional DVDs .
Blu-ray is arguably the more advanced technology , but HD DVD was out first and often costs less .
Retailer Best Buy on Monday was offering Blu-ray players for $ 400 to $ 1,000 and HD DVD players for $ 150 to $ 1,000 .
The two formats are not compatible , which means an HD DVD usually wo n't work in a Blu-ray player .
Many movie studios have released films in both formats , an inconvenience that forces them to carry twice as much inventory .
That 's why one format is expected to win out .
Toshiba has support from studios including Universal Home Video , Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Animation SKG .
But Blu-ray 's backers include 20th Century Fox , Walt Disney and Lionsgate Entertainment .
Adding to the confusion : Microsoft 's Xbox video game system and some Toshiba laptops can play only HD DVD .
Sony 's PlayStation 3 video game system and some of its laptops can play only Blu-ray .
Toshiba is hoping lower prices will help it hang on .
Price can be " a deal breaker for the mainstream consumer , " Toshiba Vice President Yoshi Uchiyama said in a statement .
But many consumers are reluctant to buy a technology that may soon be obsolete .
" Every day the Blu-ray and HD DVD camps spend prosecuting this standards war represents a day lost in their race to remain relevant , " analyst Krishna Chander at researcher iSuppli said in a recent note .
" Amid the rise of exciting new digital media offerings like YouTube , iTunes and on - demand services , the window of lucrative opportunity is closing for both standards . "
Toshiba also said it will continue ongoing promotions , including five HD DVD titles free with any of its HD DVD players .
Enlarge By Jae C. Hong , AP HD DVD logos are shown at the Toshiba booth during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
Toshiba is cutting the price of its players to compete with the better - backed Blu - Ray technology .

High above the icy fjord , the vault is almost complete .
Inside a frozen mountain not far from the North Pole , workers are building three concrete chambers to withstand global warming , floods and fires , wars and nuclear holocaust .
This Arctic safe , nicknamed the “ doomsday vault , ” will protect millions of crop seeds here on the forbidding Svalbard archipelago , the northernmost inhabited spot on the planet .
The survival of Earth ’s agriculture is being entrusted to a land inhospitable to life , where only the toughest plants , animals and humans endure .
At the entrance to the vault , visitors can see glaciers and frozen wilderness shimmering in the distance .
Should the bleakest global warming scenario come true -- a total meltdown of Antarctica and the Arctic , swamping the planet as sea levels rise -- the seeds would be sheltered in their cave here , 400 feet above the Advent Fjord .
In case of an electricity blackout , the permafrost ensures that the seeds would remain refrigerated in the state - of - the - art Svalbard Global Seed Vault .
Recalling the opening scene of the old “ Get Smart ” television show , airlocks , steel - reinforced doors and a video - monitoring system operated from Sweden hundreds of miles away are designed to protect the $ 6 - million vault deep inside the mountain .

National seed banks around the world might be devastated by natural disasters or raided in a war , but the remoteness of the Svalbard vault makes it the ultimate safety backup .
“ This is a library of life , ” said Cary Fowler , director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust , an international foundation that protects the world ’s crop seeds .
“ We ’ll be taking the knowledge embodied in these genes to fashion new solutions . ”
Agriculture continually has to adapt to the changing conditions on the planet , be they climate shifts , new pests and diseases , or increasing demand for food as the world ’s population grows .
Earth ’s biological diversity , however , is facing its worst threat in centuries , brought on by more aggressive farming methods , environmental degradation and changing weather patterns .
In the last century , as much as 75 % of the genetic diversity -- hundreds of thousands of plant varieties -- has been lost , according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization .
Every day , another plant variety becomes extinct .

“ We have a giant puzzle unfolding here , ” Fowler said .
“ We do n’t know what the picture is going to be , so we do n’t need to be throwing away the pieces , especially when it ’s so cheap to conserve them and so expensive to lose them . ”

Geography is security .
The vault ’s location on this rugged cluster of islands between the 76th and 81st parallels has been carefully chosen .
Fewer than 3,000 settlers , mostly Norwegians and Russians , live in the Arctic archipelago governed by Norway .
With rare exceptions , there are no births on the islands -- there are no social services and only limited healthcare -- and those who settle are mostly young and physically fit .

These days , the burgeoning tourism industry fuels the economy of tiny Longyearbyen , but historically it has been a mining town , and hundreds still labor in the coal pits .
During the 1960s and ‘ 70s , the Soviet Union built up a solid presence on Svalbard , which can be mined by all 40 signatories to a 1920 international treaty .
But with the demise of the Cold War , it withdrew .
Pyramiden , a Soviet - model mining town farther up the Advent Fjord , has been meticulously preserved .
On the walls of the barracks where the Soviet workers lived , yellowing photographs bear witness to their harsh life .
Lenin ’s statue still stands on the main square of this ghost town , facing east .
On Svalbard , the rugged life in the mines is giving way to an orderly life of the mind .
The scientists are taking over .

A small , newly built university campus in Longyearbyen offers undergraduate courses in Arctic biology , geology , geophysics and technology .
It ’s not uncommon to see undergraduate students , wrapped in many layers of clothing and carrying rifles , setting out toward the mountains for research trips in the tundra .
Because of the threat of polar bears , everyone leaving downtown Longyearbyen is required to carry a rifle .
Still , every few years , someone is killed by a bear in the vicinity .
Everyone in Longyearbyen has a polar bear story -- often told with Norwegian understatement -- about an encounter with one of the fearsome animals .
With the brutally cold winters here , people do n’t blink when they see someone inside the small bank wearing a ski mask and carrying a gun .
This rugged frontier attracts a tough , self - sufficient bunch difficult to impress with tales of adventure and physical prowess .
Mark Van de Weg , a Dutch sailor and boat builder , makes his living transporting scientists and other travelers around the fjords in Jonathan III , a sailboat he built .
He began coming to Greenland and Svalbard in 1994 after circumnavigating the world in a traditional wooden sailboat .
Five years ago , he wintered with his girlfriend and two guard dogs on a small sailboat stuck in the ice of a remote fjord .

“ You come home from a three - week [ expedition ] , and maybe you talk about it for 10 minutes , ” he said .
But people in the community also look out for one another .
You wo n’t be allowed to sit alone at home during Christmas , he said .
The isolation combined with the vigilance of the residents makes Svalbard a good location for the seed bank .
It ’s difficult to arrive or leave unnoticed .
On most days , there is a single flight from mainland Norway to Longyearbyen , transporting people and all food supplies .
Occasionally , icebreakers arrive from Russia and Norway .
Cars are limited to Longyearbyen .
There are no roads outside town , so moving around must be done by boat , on skis , by dog sleds or on snowmobiles .
Many tourists come to experience the peculiar seasonal phenomena of the Arctic .
During the short summer , the sun never sets .
During the winter , the islands are enveloped in unbroken darkness .
Visitors can also see the northern lights , the near - mystical green - hued illumination of the sky also known as aurora borealis .

Some travelers use Svalbard as a jumping - off point for expeditions to the North Pole , about 800 miles to the north .
Others explore the fjords , experiencing wildlife , glaciers and the array of colors produced by the freezing water and ever - changing ice .
Like calligraphy traced on a vast frozen canvas , eiders and arctic terns paint intricate patterns of flight against the backdrop of bright - blue glacier fronts .
Beneath them , puffins and seals frolic in the water or rest on floating bits of ice .
On land , white arctic foxes and polar bears hunt for prey .
Solitary wooden cabins stand abandoned in the wilderness , totems summoning memories of expeditions ending in madness and death , humans crushed by nature .

Above Longyearbyen , workers laboring in the cold have blasted through the mountain , carving out the vault intended to conserve specimens of all the known agricultural seed varieties in the world .
“ Svalbard offers a low - cost , safety backup -- it ’s a great solution to the problem , ” said Luigi Guarino , a senior science coordinator at the Global Crop Diversity Trust , which is funded in part by a $ 30 - million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
But the vault also has symbolic importance , he said .
“ To have the agreement to have all this material in one place sends an important message :
We ’re trying to work together to safeguard the world ’s agriculture . ”
Although the Norwegian government has paid for the vault ’s construction , the trust will operate it and underwrite day - to - day operations amounting to a projected $ 125,000 per year .
The trust also will help developing countries get their seeds to the Arctic .
It ’s a delicate operation : Scientists have to transport the seeds quickly in special envelopes inside sturdy boxes to protect them against decay .

The seed vault will be a bank of sorts .
In case of a local , or a global , disaster , countries can retrieve indigenous seeds to reestablish their native agriculture .
Some calamities , such as war or flooding , are sudden , but others take place over time .
Scientists believe that climate change will bring more extreme weather , flooding some areas and drying others .
Consequently , farmers and scientists will be forced to grow new varieties or entirely novel kinds of crops .
“ Although it is easy to assume that U.S. agriculture is relatively self - sufficient , all agriculture in today ’s world is interdependent , ” concludes a report published in 2005 by the University of California Genetic Resources Conservation Program , based at UC Davis .
“ Crop diversity collections are the linchpin of this interdependence , and thus central . . . to the future of U.S. agriculture . ”
International seed banks returned indigenous varieties of rice to Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge ’s failed agricultural policies three decades ago threatened to destroy the country ’s rice production .
Local bean varieties were salvaged in Rwanda after the 1994 genocide because of joint efforts by local and international researchers .
The crop has helped revive the country ’s agriculture .

After the Indian Ocean tsunami caused devastation in South Asia in 2004 , international seed banks provided Malaysia and Sri Lanka with rice varieties that could thrive in the coastal regions where large amounts of salt had been deposited by the surging seawater , according to the UC report .
“ What we ’re trying to do is an insurance policy , ” Guarino said .
“ We do n’t know if those seeds are going to become important next year or in a hundred years . ”
Some scientists involved with crop conservation , however , are less enthusiastic about the Svalbard project , which they believe could take funds away from other initiatives .
“ The problem that we have with this much - publicized project is that it tends to divert attention , energy and money away from what we consider as much more urgent and sustainable efforts to save biodiversity on the farm , ” said Henk Hobbelink , director of GRAIN , a nongovernmental organization based in Spain that promotes agricultural biodiversity .
Advertisement
More attention and funds need to be directed to farmers because their knowledge , practices and genetic resources continue the process of crop evolution , said Stephen Brush , a professor in the department of human and community development at UC Davis .
“ I would never say , do away with gene banks .
But we must be wary of thinking that gene banks are the solution to the agricultural future of the world , ” Brush said .
“ Of course , if there ’s something like a nuclear war that kills the world ’s crop plants , we certainly want to have the gene bank in Norway , but under normal circumstances , gene banks are just part of the larger picture . ”

Many countries have their own crop repositories or seed banks .
There are more than 1,400 worldwide , holding about 6.5 million plant samples .
At the federal gene bank in Fort Collins , Colo. , scientists store plant tissues in liquid nitrogen baths at minus - 213 degrees , inside high - tech cold rooms .
Advertisement
But many of the world ’s gene banks are plagued by funding shortages , management failures and equipment problems .
In the southeastern African nation of Malawi , the national seed bank consists of a chest freezer in a shack .
In Afghanistan , Taliban fighters destroyed the national seed bank in 2002 .
The following year , looters ruined Iraq ’s national seed repository .
But Iraqi scientists had smuggled a “ black box ” of plant samples across the border to Syria to safeguard them before the U.S. - led invasion that March , and Iraqi farmers today can replant their fields with indigenous crops .
The only seeds that will not be accepted for storage at the Svalbard vault are those from genetically modified plants .
As its first priority , the trust has identified “ at - risk collections , ” from countries that have material not duplicated in any of the international seed banks .
Some contain samples that will die unless they are regenerated within the next few years .
Advertisement
The seeds constitute a living legacy , the trust ’s Fowler said .
“ If we are going to survive as a species , it will be because we ’ve learned to share that heritage , ” he said .
“ I know this is just a cave in a mountain , but it ’s also the only thing I can think of that is really tangible , positive and directed toward the future with virtually all the countries working together .
Maybe there ’s a lesson in that . ”

I ’ve just finished writing up some docs on the new Cross - Site XMLHttpRequest feature in Firefox 3 .
I was a little worried at first , but it definitely appears to be both easy - to - implement and easy - to - use .
Specifically , it ’s an implementation of the W3C Access Control working draft ( which is respected by Firefox ’s XMLHttpRequest ) .
If you ’re interested in giving it a try you should fire up your copy of Firefox 3 and get ready to take it for a spin .
In a nutshell , there are two techniques that you can use to achieve your desired cross -site - request result : Specifying a special Access - Control header for your content or including an access - control processing instruction in your XML .
More information can be found in the documentation but here ’s a quick peek at what your code might look like :
An HTML document ( served via PHP ) that specifies an Access - Control header : ( Demo – FF3 Only )
<? php //
Change this to allow < yourdomain.com > to make it accessible to your site , or allow <*> for ANYONE to be able to access it .
header (' Access - Control : allow < ejohn.org > ' ) ; ?> < b> John Resig</b>
An XML document that specifies an access - control processing instruction : ( Demo – FF3 Only )
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> <!--
Change this to allow =" yourdomain.com " to make it accessible to your site , or allow= " * " for ANYONE to be able to access it .
--> <?access-control allow=" ejohn.org " ?> < simple >< name > John Resig</ name ></ simple >
Now what ’s especially nice about all this is that you do n’t have to change a single line of your client - side code to make this work !
Take , for example , this page which requests an HTML file from a remote domain – and , specifically , the JavaScript within it :
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; xhr.open ( " GET " , " http://dev.jquery.com/~john/xdomain/test.php " , true ) ; xhr.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { if ( xhr.ready State == 4 ) { if ( xhr.status == 200 ) { document.body.innerHTML
= " My Name is : " + xhr.responseText ; } else { document .body.innerHTML
= " ERROR " ; } } } ; xhr.send ( null ) ;
This is same - old pure - blood JavaScript / DOM / XMLHttpRequest , as we ’re use to it .
For some limited applications , I think this functionality is already going to be terribly useful – and once wider adoption starts to trickle in we can certainly see a whole range of applications , especially in the area of client - side applications and mashups .
It goes without arguing that 2007 was one of the best years of gaming in a very long time .
It seemed like every console and handheld had a robust handful of topnotch games , covering pretty much every genre in the book ( from beautifully designed platformers to epic first - person shooters ) .
There really was a little something for everyone .
The downside to all this win , however , was trying to get a very opinionated group of people to pick one game to rule supreme above all others .
Luckily , a brilliant solution to this dilemma was chosen : Early last week , all of the Destructoid staff met in an abandoned cave at an undisclosed location .
After setting up camp in our uncomfortably damp meeting ground , we all agreed to not leave until we came to a unanimous decision for Destructoid Game of the Year 2007 .
I will save the details of what went down for a future community blog , but just know that I saw things I will never forget for the rest of my life .
Horrible things .
Messy things .
The good news : not only did we all get out alive ( well , most of us ) , we actually came to a reasonably coherent decision !
Not to be a tease , but the winner will actually be revealed tomorrow .
In the meantime ( and to whet your appetite for the main event ) , hit the jump for a list of the Top Five finalists : the official nominees for Destructoid Game of the Year 2007 .
[ Thanks to Topher for the awesome Photoshop ]
It was a tough and bloody decision , but here they are , in no particular order ( well , except alphabetical ) :
BioShock
BioShock , the shockingly gorgeous first - person shooter , has received universal acclaim from multiple sources , with the Destructoid editors being no exception .
Even the few that have n’t had the chance to play it yet have fallen in love with the game ’s beautifully realized locale and extremely creepy style .
In fact , Aaron Linde and Colette actually named last week ’s home - in - the - side - of - the - mountain away from home “ Rapture ” ( after the now legendary underwater utopia in the game ) .
It was really cute until Colette started following Aaron around all the time and calling him “ Mr. Bubbles . ”
There is a fine line between cute and creepy , my friends .
A very fine line .

Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare
Given the series ’ well - received roots , it was an almost given that Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare would be an excellent game .
What surprised people the most was how great it turned out to be .
With an endlessly immersive single - player campaign and multiplayer that even gives Papa Halo a serious run for its money , Call of Duty 4 is easily one of the best ( and most entertaining ) games of the year .
During last week ’s “ spelunking ” adventure , while pinning Orcist to the ground in a hunger induced rage , I think it was Grim that said : “ If Call of Duty 4 does n’t win Game of the Year I swear I will eat Orcist ’s leg .
I swear it !
Do n’t tempt me ! ”
How can you argue with that ?
[ Check out the original Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare review here ]
Mass Effect
While garnering some mixed reactions overall , Mass Effect had a huge , well , effect on a majority of the Destructoid editors , easily placing it as one of the finalists for Game of the Year .
The battle system may take a little getting used to ( no tutorial ? ) , but the deep characters and revolutionary dialogue system make this sci-fi RPG a must - have and one of the most memorable games of its type in a very long while .
Unfortunately , Jim Sterling did not support this nomination and most definitely made it known during last week ’s meeting .
Poor . tiff .
She will have monocle - shaped scars all over her body for weeks .
Please do n’t ask .
I do n’t know if I can stand to relive it .

The Orange Box
If there is one thing that every single member of the gaming community can agree on concerning 2007 , it ’s that The Orange Box is the best value in the history of videogames .
Including the original Half - Life 2 , Half - Life 2 : Episode One , Half - Life 2 : Episode Two , the superb Portal , and the addictive Team Fortress 2 all on one disc for one surprisingly reasonable price ?
It does n’t really get any better than that .
Throw in the fact that all five games are exceptional and you have a classic compilation whose quality may never be topped .
Reverend Anthony was extra angry last week ( someone gets a little cranky in small remote spaces , I gander ) , but showed a surprisingly sweet side when he led our feisty group in a rousing sing - a- long to the final song in Portal .
The roasted bat we were all sharing at the time could never have tasted better .

Super Mario Galaxy
Even looking back across all systems , Super Mario Galaxy was one of the most anticipated videogames of the year .
Remarkably , the game not only lived up to all the hype , it surpassed it in almost anyone ’s eyes .
Thrusting Mario ’s classic adventures into space seemed the perfect evolution , resulting in some of the most clever and jaw - dropping level design of all time .
Super Mario Galaxy is undeniable proof that Mario still remains a lethal force in the videogame world , even after all these years .
We all knew this game would be a serious contender when , while taking a nap during last week ’s discussions , Tristero and Jonathan Holmes continuously whispered the name “ Rosalina ” in their heat exhaustive sleep .
It would have been precious , had Topher and Dyson not ruined the moment by putting the poor slumbering souls ’ hands in bowls of warm stalactite water , trying to get them to pee their Goomba - patterned pants .
Real mature , guys .

Sometimes , it ’s hard to have faith in democracy , in people .
The same people who , in their wisdom , elected George W. Bush to a second term .
At the time though , I felt there was even a wisdom in that decision , even as it may have been unintentional ; because a John Kerry presidency would not be able to fully repudiate the legacy of Bush , both because Kerry had campaigned as a hawk and because the public had not come around to see the disaster that was the Bush administration .
As the fallout from the Bush administration ’s incredible arrogance and ineptitude shook the country during Bush ’s second term , I could only imagine a President Kerry , were he elected , and the values he stood for , getting some portion of the blame for the foreign policy setbacks , for the civil war in Iraq , for the economic crises , for the falling dollar – none of which would have been reversed by anything less than a radical overhaul of America ’s domestic and foreign policies .
A President Kerry would not have been in a position accomplish anything except make Bush ’s disasters hurt us a little less .
It was better that the blame was placed on the right shoulders , on the right ideology – especially as a liberal president would not have been able to fully take on Bush ’s legacy without the overwhelming support of the American people .
Today , there is that overwhelming support to root out the Bush legacy .
And with the support for Barack Obama , John Edwards , Dennis Kucinich , Ron Paul and even to some extent Mike Huckabee and John McCain , there is obviously support for stepping away from the Clinton legacy of triangulation as well .
It is hard to have faith that on February 5th , voters ( who actions will account for over 40 % of the delegates to the Democratic convention ) will make a wise choice .
Democracy is clearly a flawed method of choosing a president , even if may be the best .
Fraud is always possible ; the media coverage is generally less than exemplary ; many people seem to make up their minds on a whim .
It will be a struggle to redirect this election and this primary back where it belongs – on making a fundamental choice about the direction America is headed .
The choice we face is not about policies or style , but about who we are as a nation – about restoring the processes and balance that allow Americans to be free ; about bringing the country together to face the long - term challenges to our way of life ; about restoring America ’s voice in the world community , and creating a more sensible foreign policy based on our shared values .
It will not be easy – either to win or to accomplish these changes .
But worthwhile change should be hard .
In a democracy , there should be no coronation , no inevitable victories .
The silver lining on yesterday ’s loss is that the Democratic nominee has to fight to get much of the country behind him or her before he or she is declared the nominee .
No longer are we relying on New Hampshire and Iowa , Nevada and South Carolina to decide our options .
Now the fight moves on to California and New York ; to Connecticut , Kansas , Alaska , Idaho , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Georgia , New Jersey , Tennessee , Colorado , Illinois , Arizona , Alabama , Arkansas , Delaware , Missouri , New Mexico , North Dakota , Oklahoma , and Utah .
Now we need to prove that we can mobilize to bring real change across America , instead of in a few rural states .
It wo n’t be easy .
But it should n’t be .
Change is hard .

This little image shows the reason for so many things in this world …
HM Revenue and Customs was last night accused of taking a cavalier attitude to the protection of data on ordinary taxpayers after it emerged that MPs , royals and celebrities were banned from filling in their tax returns online for security reasons .
HMRC faced accusations of encouraging a two - tier system after thousands of Britons which are regarded as " high profile " are being asked to send in their applications by post while the general public – around three million users – are required to provide their details on the internet - based system .
Consumer groups questioned why the same level of security was not being offered to all users after a minister admitted : " There are categories of individual for whom security is a higher priority . "
The disclosure follows the highly damaging " datagate " fiasco last November in which child benefit information including names , addresses , National Insurance numbers and the bank details of 25 million people were lost in the post .
The news will fuel suspicions that the HMRC 's security systems are not secure .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The restrictions were uncovered after the Conservative MP Andrew Robathan asked questions in Parliament after receiving a letter from HMRC .
He said : " I received a letter recently telling me that 31 January is my final deadline for a tax return , and encouraging me to file my tax return online , saying that that was the best way for me to do so .
Given our discussions on the efficiency of HMRC recently , how come I have also been sent a letter from HMRC saying that I cannot file online ? "
In response , Jane Kennedy , a Treasury minister , said : " [ It is ] not just Members of Parliament – there are several categories of people in that position – and HMRC does not have the facilities for them to file online . "
Last night the HMRC insisted that it was " technical issues " which were preventing the " higher security " individuals filing online because they are held under " separate arrangements " .
A spokesperson said : " A tiny minority of individuals ' records , including MPs , have extra security measures in place over and above the very high standards of confidentiality with which HMRC treats all taxpayers ' data .
The separate arrangements for dealing with these records mean that they are currently unable to use the online service .
HMRC is continuing to look at ways to extend the online filing service to this group . "
But Mark Wallace , of the TaxPayers '
Alliance , said : " This double - standard is unacceptable .
If the online system is not secure enough for MPs , why should ordinary taxpayers put up with it ? "
Donors can have their own agendas , too .
The academic literature on donor psychology offers many examples , like a man who sought the adulation of his community by offering a kidney to his minister , a daughter who competed with her own mother to be the rescuer of another family member and a woman who told researchers that her motive for wanting to give a kidney to a stranger was to become “ ‘ Daddy ’s good girl . ”
Then there is the “ black - sheep donor , ” a wayward relative who shows up to offer an organ as an act of redemption , hoping to reposition himself in the family ’s good graces .
For others , donation is a sullen fulfillment of familial duty , a way to avoid the shame and guilt of allowing a relative to suffer needlessly and even die .
By comparison , friends are better insulated from emotional pressures ; their compassion is less likely to be tinged with obligation , let alone tainted by it .
And the rare Good Samaritan donor who cold - calls a transplant center to donate to the next suitable person in the queue , not even knowing who will get his kidney , surely embodies the purest form of altruism .
In the end , though , people who do n’t want to donate usually manage to extract themselves .
They miss appointments for screening tests or just drop out of the process .
People who actually do become donors , however , usually regard it as a supremely gratifying experience : they were given a blessed opportunity to save a life , a chance that relatives of a dying cancer patient can only dream of .
I ’ve read of siblings jousting to give an organ to a cherished parent and of adult children who were heartbroken when doctors ruled them out on medical grounds .
According to a review of published surveys on donor attitudes by Mary Amanda Dew , a psychologist as the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , about 95 percent of donors say they would do it again .
Most experience a boost in self - worth and enjoy feelings of deep purpose , while only a small minority regret having donated or report that their relationships with recipients changed for the worse .
From my medical training , I was familiar with some of the ins and outs of end - stage renal disease .
I had an especially morbid dread of dialysis .
The playwright Neil Simon received a kidney from his longtime publicist in 2004  “ The Odd Donor Couple , ” as The New York Times put it  but before that he endured 18 wretched months on dialysis , suffering cramps and vomiting spells that kept him largely confined to his house .
His memory deteriorated , and he hated the time away from his writing .
Shortly before his donor came forward ( unsolicited , it should be noted ) , Simon ’s doctors said he might have to start spending more time on dialysis .
If that were necessary , he said , he had decided , “ I did n’t want to live my life anymore . ”
Neither , I thought , would I .
It is possible that I was overestimating how miserable I would be on dialysis .
An avalanche of psychological data shows that people are far better at handling adversity when it actually befalls them than they expect they will be .
Still , I was quite sure I would flout the longstanding evidence attesting to human adaptability .
On dialysis I would be disconsolate and maybe even suicidal if the wait for an organ were to stretch for years .
As dispiriting , I would lose all my friends .
Not that I expected them to abandon me .
I would abandon them out of anger for not rescuing me .
By the end of the summer of 2005 , a year after the diagnosis , there was no donor in sight .
I was mentally preparing myself to undergo the standard predialysis operation to create “ access ” to the machine .
A vein and artery in my arm would be joined to create a large superficial vessel for the insertion of needles and tubing that would carry my blood to and from the machine .
I resisted , but I knew that soon I would n’t be able to put off dialysis any longer .
The “ tyranny of the gift ” now took on a new meaning for me .
It was no longer about moral debt ; it was about the very fact that an organ had to be a gift , about the tyranny of the system .
I heard of people trying to persuade strangers to give them organs .
They put up bulletin boards or started Web sites ( GordyNeedsAKidney.org , whose opening page carried the plaintive headline , “ Please Help Our Dad ” ) .
I flirted with the idea of becoming a “ transplant tourist ” in Turkey or the Philippines , where I could buy a kidney .
Or going to China , where I would have to face the frightful knowledge that my kidney would probably come from an executed prisoner .
Grim choices , but I was afraid I could die on dialysis if I did n’t do something to save myself .
Over the past year or so , much of the work that I have been involved with touches the elderly , particularly old black farmers and people who have difficulty deciphering various documents and navigating America ’s complex , often hostile bureaucracies .
For them , the world is often a confusing maze of undecipherable bills , illegible legal papers , impatient clerks , and last , but not least of all , ‘ customer dis- service ’ representatives who grind the old folks into pieces beneath the weight of their bureaucratic bludgeons .
For whatever reason , this country does not appreciate its elderly citizens .
Where the elderly and aged in other nations are honored and have a special place in society as advisors and wisdom keepers , the twisted thing that has become American society chooses to disrespect its elders and throw away its youth , in some kind of senseless , suicidal journey to chaos .
Over and over we read about children killing or raping other children .
And , does it move us ?
Do we get up off of our chairs , couches and sofas and challenge the evil that is stalking our children ?
Do we reclaim our children from the streets ?
Apparently not , if the recent atrocities involving kids are concerned .
We have eight year olds being charged with RAPE !!!!
Say what ?
Ya’ll know I ’m an old fogey because the last time I checked , eight year olds were 2nd or 3rd graders who are still trying to wrap their heads around multiplication tables .
Now we hear about kids being charged with rape , armed robbery and goodness knows what else .
What a world !
What madness .
But , most telling is the abdication of adult responsibility and the lack of social justice in the whole matrix .
Rather than facing our responsibility on the parental , neighborhood and school level , we throw money at the problem .
If that does n’t work , we throw the kids away in institutions and wash our bloody hands of the whole thing .
Today , we have eight year olds up on charges of rape , murder and gang shootings .
And ambitious prosecutors take advantage of the public ’s fear and outrage , all too ready to charge these kids as adults , throwing out centuries of common law precedent .
Back in the day — you know the ones , where we had stone tablets and a stylus to take notes on , criminal justice professors first began their coursework with a history of common law , the tenets of which is the idea of capacity , comprehension of the deed and understanding of its consequences .
In the old days , it was assumed that a child had to reach a certain age before he understood the differences between right and wrong , the consequences of his actions .
This is known as the infancy defense .
Today , the Infancy Defense , particularly in cases involving black children and black boys , most of all , has been thrown out of the window .
Society is twitching and moaning and the law and order politicians are sucking up to the frightened masses by sacrificing troubled children on the altar of convenience .
Black children are being roasted on the spit , as society wallows in an orgy of “ law and order ” .
Obviously these children are not at home doing their homework or chores .
That being said , where exactly are our children these days and what do they do with their spare time ?
And how many parents know , or even care ?
An immigrant from India told me in conversation a while back that he had a major blow up with his son over the son ’s desire to work at a fast food joint for spare cash .
The parent told his child that , as a child he had a job : to study hard in school and get the best grades he was capable of getting .
He was guiding his child , keeping an eye on his son's grades and nurturing him for a broader future , where the child had the foundation for successfully obtaining a middle class life , based on his education and personal discipline .
Here in this place we call America , the idea of discipline , personal responsibility and parental involvement has become outmoded .
So much so , that in some schools , teachers are afraid of their students — too afraid to actually teach .
In many of our schools , our teachers have become glorified jail guards , spending more time keeping the lid on than teaching the “ 3 R’s ” .
Moreover , in too many neighborhoods , society has broken down so much that parents are afraid of their own children , and the children are so afraid of everything that they shoot first and cry later .
To salve its conscience , our government officials and politicians make a mockery out of “ justice ” .
Under the pretext of keeping us safe , over - zealous prosecutors pander to terrified voters with their pseudo get tough on crime campaigns , charging children as adults in bloody frenzies of partisan politics , as if charging one out of control child as an adult will defuse the breeding grounds which nurture feral children faster than garbage dumps attract rats .
We continue to allow these political sharks to divert and distract us from our falling apart schools , playgrounds that are too dangerous to play in and neighborhoods which have long lost the concept of “ neighbors . ”
Instead , we participate in the organized lynching of selected children , sacrificing them to the gods of diversion and distraction .
As the political predators feast on deviant children , the bureaucrats are in full get out the vote mode , pretending they care about making a difference .
It seems the only difference any of us really care about is how to get these kids out of our hair in the most convenient manner possible .
And , so we solve the problem by charging the kids as adults , throwing the key away until they are 18 , and then we pretend we are confused when they come out of the system with a PhD in mayhem .

Forget the Qassams .
Forget the mortar shells .
They are nothing compared with what Hamas launched at us this week .
The chief of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip , Ismail Haniyeh , has approached an Israeli newspaper and proposed a cease - fire .
No more Qassams , no more mortars , no suicide bombings , no Israeli military incursions into the Strip , no “ targeted liquidations ” of leaders .
A total cease - fire .
And not only in the Gaza Strip , but in the West Bank , too .
The military leadership exploded in anger .
Who does he think he is , that bastard ?
That he can stop us with such dirty tricks ?
This is the second time within a few days that an attempt has been made to thwart our war plans .
Two weeks ago , the American intelligence community declared , in an authoritative report , that Iran had stopped its attempt to produce a nuclear bomb as early as four years ago .
Instead of heaving a sigh of relief , Israeli officials reacted with undisguised anger .
Since then , all the commentators in Israel , as well as our huge network of hired pens around the world , have tried to undermine this document .
It is mendacious , without foundation , motivated by a hidden , sinister agenda .
But miraculously , the report survived unscathed .
It has not even been scratched .
The report , so it seems , has swept from the table any possibility of an American and / or Israeli military attack on Iran .
Now comes the peace initiative of Haniyeh and endangers the strategy of our military establishment towards the Gaza Strip .
Again , the army choir gets going .
Generals in uniform and out of uniform , military correspondents , political correspondents , commentators of all stripes and genders , politicians from Left and Right  all are attacking the Haniyeh offer .
The message is : it must not be accepted under any circumstances !
It should not even be considered !
On the contrary : the offer shows that Hamas is about to break , and therefore the war against it must be intensified , the blockade on Gaza must be tightened , more leaders must be killed  indeed , why not kill Haniyeh himself ?
What are we waiting for ?
A paradox inherent in the conflict since its beginning is at work here : if the Palestinians are strong , it is dangerous to make peace with them .
If they are weak , there is no need to make peace with them .
Either way , they must be broken .
“ There is nothing to talk about ! ” Ehud Olmert declared at once .
So everything is all right , the bloodletting can go on .
And it is indeed going on .
In the Gaza Strip and around it , a cruel little war is being waged .
As usual , each side claims that it is only reacting to the atrocities of the other side .
The Israeli side claims that it is responding to the Qassams and mortars .
What sovereign state could tolerate being bombarded by deadly missiles from the other side of the border ?
True , thousands of missiles have killed only a tiny number of people .
More than 100 times as many are killed and injured on the roads .
But the Qassams are sowing terror , so the inhabitants of Sderot and the surrounding area demand revenge and reinforcement for their houses , which would cost a fortune .
If the Qassams were really bothering our political and military leaders , they would have jumped at the cease - fire offer .
But the leaders do n’t really care about what ’s happening to the Sderot population , out on the geographical and political “ periphery , " far from the center of the country .
It carries no political or economic weight .
In the eyes of the leadership , its suffering is , all in all , tolerable .
It also has an important positive side : it provides an ideal pretext for the actions of the army .
The Israeli strategic aim in Gaza is not to put an end to the Qassams .
It would still be the same if not a single Qassam fell on Israel .
The real aim is to break the Palestinians , which means breaking Hamas .
The method is simple , even primitive : to tighten the blockade on land , on sea and in the air , until the situation in the Strip becomes absolutely intolerable .
The total stoppage of supplies , except the very minimum necessary to prevent starvation , has reduced life to an inhuman level .
There are effectively no imports or exports , economic life has ground to a standstill , the cost of living has risen sky - high .
The supply of fuel has already been reduced by half , and is planned to sink even lower .
The water supply can be cut at will .
Military activity is gradually increasing .
The Israeli army conducts daily incursions , employing tanks and armored bulldozers , in order to nibble at the margins of the inhabited areas and draw the Palestinian fighters into a face to face confrontation .
Every day , from five to 10 Palestinian fighters are being killed , together with some civilians .
Every day , inhabitants are being abducted in order to extract information from them .
The declared purpose is attrition , to harry and wear down , and perhaps also to prepare for the re-conquest of the Strip  even if the army chiefs want to avoid this at almost any price .
One after another , the Palestinian leaders and commanders are being killed from the air .
Every point in the Strip is exposed to Israeli airplanes , helicopter gunships , and drones .
Up - to - date technology makes it possible to track the “ children of death , " those marked for killing , and a wide net of informers and agents , some of them under duress , which has been built up well in advance , completes the picture .
The army chiefs hope that by tightening all these screws they can push the local population to rise up against Hamas and the other fighting organizations .
All Palestinian opposition to the occupation will collapse .
The entire Palestinian people will raise their hands in surrender and submit to the mercies of the occupation , which will be able to do as it pleases  expropriate lands , enlarge settlements , set up walls and roadblocks , slice up the West Bank into a series of semi-autonomous enclaves .
In this Israeli plan , the job reserved for the Palestinian Authority is to act as subcontractors for Israeli security , in return for a stream of money that will safeguard its control of the enclaves .
At the end of this phase of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , the Palestinian people are supposed to be cut to pieces and helpless in face of the Israeli expansion .
The historic clash between the unstoppable force ( the Zionist enterprise ) and the immovable object ( the Palestinian population ) will end with the crushing of Palestinian opposition .
In order to succeed in this , a sophisticated diplomatic game must be played .
Under no circumstances may the support of the international community be lost .
On the contrary , the entire world , led by the U.S. and EU , must support Israel and look upon its actions as a just struggle against Palestinian terrorism , itself an integral part of “ international terrorism . "
The Annapolis conference , and afterward the Paris meeting , were important steps in this direction .
Almost the whole world , including most of the Arab world , has fallen into step with the Israeli plan  perhaps innocently , perhaps cynically .
Events after Annapolis developed as expected : no negotiations have started , both sides are just playing with images .
The very first day after Annapolis , the Israeli government announced huge building projects beyond the Green Line .
When Condoleezza Rice mumbled some words of opposition , it was announced that the plans had been shelved .
In fact they continue at full speed .
How do Olmert and his colleagues fool the whole world ?
Benjamin Disraeli once said about a certain British politician : “ The Right Honorable Gentleman surprised his opponents bathing in the sea and took away their clothes . ”
We , the pioneers of the Two - State Solution , can say this about our government .
It has stolen our flag and wrapped it around itself in order to hide its intentions .
At long last , there now exists a worldwide consensus that peace in our region must be based on the coexistence of the state of Israel and the state of Palestine .
Our government has slipped into it and is exploiting this agreement with another aim altogether : the rule of Israel in the whole country and the turning of the Palestinian population centers into a series of Bantustans .
This is , in fact , a One - State Solution ( Greater Israel ) in the guise of the Two - State Solution .
Can this plan succeed ?
The battle of Gaza is in full swing .
In spite of the huge military superiority of the Israeli army , it is not one - sided .
Even the Israeli commanders point out that the Hamas forces are getting stronger .
They train hard , their weapons are getting more effective , and they show a lot of courage and determination .
It seems that the falling of their commanders and fighters in a steady bloodletting is not affecting their morale .
That is one of the reasons why the Israeli army is shrinking back from re-conquering the Gaza Strip .
Inside the Strip , both the main organizations enjoy wide public support  the demonstration to commemorate Yassir Arafat organized by Fatah and the counter - demonstration of Hamas each drew hundreds of thousands of participants .
But it seems that the great majority of the Palestinian public wants national unity in order to fight together against the occupation .
They do not want religious compulsion , but neither will they tolerate a leadership that cooperates with the occupation .
The government may be very mistaken in counting on the obedience of Fatah .
Competing with Hamas , Fatah may surprise us by becoming a fighting organization once again .
The stream of money flowing into the Authority may not prevent this .
Ze ’ev Jabotinsky was wiser than Tony Blair when he said 85 years ago that you can not buy a whole people .
If the Israeli army invades Gaza in order to re-conquer it , the population will stand behind the fighters .
Nobody can know how it will react if the economic misery gets worse .
The results may be unexpected .
Experience with other liberation movements indicates that misery can break a population , but it can also strengthen it .
This is , simply put , an existential test for the Palestinian people  perhaps the most severe since 1948 .
It is also a test for the shrewd policy of Ehud Olmert , Ehud Barak , Tzipi Livni , and the army chiefs .
So a cease - fire is not likely to come into effect .
At first Olmert rejected one out of hand .
Then this was denied .
Then the denial was denied .
The inhabitants of Sderot would probably have been glad to accept a cease - fire .
But then , who bothers to ask them ?
Bush : Mukasey for Attorney General or none at all RAW STORY
Published : Thursday November 1 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This President Bush , fueling the effort to confirm the 66 - year - old retired judge Michael B. Mukasey , emphasizes the need for the service of an Attorney General , particularly , he says , while the nation is at war .
Reports the New York Times , the President aired his grievances to a small group of reporters over Mukasey 's treatment by the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings .
Recently , Mukasey stood up for the equal treatment of gay and lesbian Department of Justice employees , but at the same time , has been heavily criticized for his refusal to provide a clear answer on whether or not the interrogation technique known as " waterboarding " is considered torture .
While President Bush denounced the grilling of Mukasey over a practice he says Mukasey has n't been briefed on , Bush declined just the same to discuss " waterboarding , " assuring his invitees that interrogation techniques are " within the law , " performed by " highly trained professionals . "
" That 's what 's important for America to know , " he adds .
In a speech to the Heritage Foundation , Bush worked to imply that not confirming Mukasey would result in no Attorney General " during this time of war , " guaranteed .
# EXCERPTS :  Theyve been carefully reviewed by the Department of Justice and are very carefully monitored ,  Mr. Cheney said of the techniques , in an appearance before the American Legion in Indianapolis .
 The program is run by highly trained professionals who understand their obligations under the law .
And the program has uncovered a wealth of information that has foiled attacks against the United States ; information that has on numerous occasions made all the difference between life and death . 
Senator Edward M. Kennedy , a Massachusetts
Democrat who is on the committee , said today that he would vote against the nominee , and only in part because of Mr. Mukasey s refusal to answer directly whether he thinks waterboarding is torture .
 I found little comfort in other areas as well ,  the senator said , going on to say that he is dismayed by the nominees opinions about the extent of a presidents powers to order an American citizen detained without charges , and other areas of executive power .
 I therefore intend to oppose this nomination ,  Mr. Kennedy said on the Senate floor .
 Judge Mukasey appears to be a careful , conscientious and intelligent lawyer , and he has served our country honorably for many years .
But those qualities are not enough for this critical position at this critical time . #

Top 10 Discoveries of 2007
Hardly week goes by without a major archaeological discovery or the publication of a radical new theory about the human past .
Reducing a year 's worth of these stories to the 10 most important was a tall order , especially since our intent was to go beyond the headlines and select those we thought made a significant impact on the field - - ones that will be talked about for decades .
With that in mind , here are our picks for the 2007's most important finds ...
Marvel today launched a " Digital Comics " initiative which will offer certain vintage content online for $ 9.99 a month or $ 4.99 a month if you stump up for an annual subscription .
Among the stuff on offer is the " first original run of X - Men " , and issues one to 100 of both Amazing Spider - Man and Fantastic Four , as well as " so much more ! "
What you do n't get is the latest issues , which wo n't be made available for six months after their release date - and you can't download material , so it 's browser - only perusal of Marvel material .
Tentative it may be , but Reuters describes the Marvel net launch as " the industry 's most aggressive web push yet " .
It 's a natural reaction to kids ' changing habits and a market shift away from traditional paper .
Marvel prez Dan Buckley , evidently having just come from a meeting with the comapny 's Strategy Boutique , said : " You do n't have that spinner rack of comic books sitting in the local five - and - dime anymore .
We do n't have our product intersecting kids in their lifestyle space as much as we used to . "
Other comic outfits currently attempting to intersect with kids in their lifestyle space are Dark Horse Comics , which is punting itself down at MySpace , and DC Comics allegedly has issues available on the world 's premier hilarious amateur vid site . ®
While you 're sifting through the quarterly campaign finance reports today , you may be wondering where Fred Dalton Thompson 's filings are , since , obviously , he 's running for President too .
Here 's his disclosures in their entirety :
In other words , no filings from Thompson as to who he 's raising money from , or how he 's spending it -- and also , unlike everyone else in the field , no financial disclosure statement yet as to his personal riches .
[ And , also , as long as he's not a " candidate , " the equal time rules regarding his Law & Order episodes do n't apply , and he can receive that free advertising . ]
See , Thompson claims he's not really a candidate for President yet ; he 's just " testing the waters " .
Now , friends , that 's not a made - up term -- under the FEC rules , you can delay your initial campaign filings if you 're truly not sure if you want to run , and want to raise and spend a little money to determine if your candidacy would be viable .
But the ability to use this loophole ceases if it 's clear that you 've decided to become a candidate , and there are extrinsic factors are used by the FEC to determine if that 's the case .
I 'll focus on three :
If you raise funds in excess of amounts reasonably required for exploratory activity or amass funds for use after candidacy is established ;
If you conduct activities over a protracted period of time ( or shortly before an election ) ; and
If you make or authorize statements that refer to yourself as a candidate .
Raising Funds Beyond What You Need To " Explore "
Well , Thompson claims to have " taken in at least several million dollars " , and the New York Post confirms that the campaign had " made significant strides toward the nearly $ 5 million that Thompson 's ' First Day Founders ' have committed to raising as seed money for a full - fledged presidential campaign . "
Indeed , almost a month ago , the WaPo reported the campaign 's acknowledgement that it " seems on track to reach his goal of raising about $ 5 million in just one month , according to advisers . "
Long - Term Planning
When your campaign " signed a long - term lease on a building in Nashville that will serve as its national headquarters " , you 're engaging in protracted campaign activity .
Calling Yourself A " Candidate "
Here 's some of what Thompson has said already :
June 26 , 2007 : " You 're either running or not running .
I think the steps we 're taking are pretty obvious . "
June 4 , 2007 : Thompson referred in the past tense to having decided " I ’m going to do this , " and then again talks about " when I did " decide to run for President .
Also in that interview , Thompson claims his Internet presence " has allowed me to be in the hunt , so to speak , without spending a dime . "

June 6 , 2007 : Thompson tells CNBC 's Kudlow and Cramer that his campaign is a foregone conclusion , saying " Well , I do n't want to get into a lot of details in terms of a plan before I even announce my candidacy . "
July 12 , 2007 : Thompson advisor Mary Matalin tells the WaPo , " He has made up his mind .
And one can appreciate that planning the announcement of what 's on his mind needs to take place in a deliberative fashion . "
As one campaign finance attorney put it today , Thompson is " playing footsie " with the campaign rules .
Thompson allegedly believes in " more disclosure " in the campaign finance realm .
Let 's see him prove it .
What could he possibly be hiding ?
In an escalation of clashes between U.S. Border Patrol agents and rock - throwing smugglers , agents have begun launching pepper spray and tear gas into densely populated Mexican border neighborhoods , according to witnesses , Mexican authorities and human rights groups .
The more aggressive approach reflects the tense climate in this city ’s most notorious smuggling neighborhood , Colonia Libertad , where U.S. agents say they have had to counter human traffickers ’ increasingly aggressive tactics by ramping up their own use of force .
Agents have used pepper spray in the past , but usually aimed directly at the smugglers .
The new tactics , which saturate large areas , have forced dozens of temporary evacuations and sent some residents to hospitals , according to witnesses .
Border Patrol officials say tear gas and pepper spray rarely cause serious injury or damage .
They say that they use them against assailants trying to divert attention from border crossers by pelting agents , and that residents are not targeted .
Since Oct. 1 , the Border Patrol has counted 90 assaults against agents in the San Diego area , five times as many as during the same period a year ago .
Agents have suffered serious head injuries , officials say .
The acting Mexican consul general in San Diego , Ricardo Pineda , has met with Border Patrol officials to protest the aggressive use of tear gas and pepper spray , said Alberto Lozano , the consular spokesman .
“ We told them the Mexican government cannot tolerate having Mexican nationals hit with these kind of devices on Mexican soil by U.S. authorities , regardless of the reason , ” Lozano said .
Residents of the area ’s hillside shanties and muddy streets say the Border Patrol ’s measures neglect their welfare .
Some agents , they say , show compassion , even apologizing for the tactics .
But others are defiant and continue saturating areas despite their pleas .
“ I said to the agent , ‘ Put yourself in my place .
I have two children , ’ ” said Robis Guadalupe Argumeo , who added that her home has been gassed three times since August , most recently after a verbal exchange with an agent Saturday .
“ He said , ‘ I ’m the policeman of the world .
No one can touch me . ’ ”
The agent , Argumeo said , was peering over the border fence pointing his pepper - spray launcher at her house .
She said that she told him , “ But this is n’t Iraq , this is Mexico ” but that he continued firing into the neighborhood .
The clashes are taking place east of the San Ysidro port of entry along a two - mile stretch of border where Colonia Libertad , one of Tijuana ’s most densely populated neighborhoods , pushes up against the frontier .
This was once a heavily trampled immigrant - smuggling corridor where hundreds crossed nightly , but trafficking slowed considerably a decade ago when U.S. authorities erected two layers of fencing .
In recent months , however , illegal crossings and assaults have increased dramatically , agents say .
Apprehensions of illegal immigrants are up 7 % this year in the San Diego area , the only area on the Southwest border that showed an increase from last year .
The situation has deteriorated to the point that authorities are considering whether to add barbed wire to fencing along certain areas bordering Colonia Libertad , an option avoided in the past because of the negative symbolism .
Agents say smugglers -- by wearing cardboard shields or heavy jackets to deflect the projectiles -- long ago adapted to the original tactic of shooting pepper balls directly at them .
The agents say the pepper balls , which explode on impact , do n’t seem to affect some of the hardened smugglers .
Using larger quantities of pepper spray and tear gas is more likely to disrupt their operations and de-escalate violence , agents say .
Smugglers throw rocks and other objects as one way to give immigrants time to scale the fences and disappear .
Agents say the attacks are highly coordinated .
Two years ago an agent fatally shot a rock thrower in Colonia Libertad , prompting protests from the Mexican government .
Border Patrol officials say using nonlethal weapons is the best way to avoid deadly outcomes .
“ It ’s either that or you allow those people to assault our agents at an astronomical level and somebody gets killed , ” said Agent Richard Smith , a Border Patrol spokesman .
“ The alien - and drug - smuggling organizations should be ashamed for using innocent people as shields .
It just goes to show they prioritize profit over human safety . ”
Some Mexican residents sympathize with the U.S. agents .
Carmen Lopez , 63 , scolds smugglers who climb onto her tar - paper roof to get a better view of Border Patrol activity .
“ The smugglers tell me , ‘ We ’re just trying to make a living like anyone else , ’ ” she said .
But a smuggler pelted her for complaining , and she now stays inside .
If anyone ’s to blame , she said , it ’s the Tijuana police , who should crack down ; until then the Border Patrol ’s tactics are justified .
“ How can they be at fault ?
They have a right to defend themselves , ” Lopez said .
Many others disagree .
In the last few weeks , there have been at least six incidents of Border Patrol agents throwing or shooting pepper spray or tear gas into the area , forcing the temporary evacuations of dozens of people , according to witnesses and others .
After a canister -- possibly of pepper spray , possibly of tear gas -- exploded outside her home in late November , Marisela Arias , 19 , who is four months pregnant , said she struggled to breathe and fainted .
Her husband , Miguel Arias , 23 , took her to the hospital , where he vomited , he said .
Their extended family of more than eight left the house until the smoke cleared , he said .
Aberto Rojas , 37 , who lives a few blocks from the Arias ’ home , said he had a similar encounter with the Border Patrol the next day .
Agents had targeted a smuggler who was hiding behind a van near Rojas ’ property .
The canister they fired in the smuggler ’s direction skipped on a parked car and bounced into Rojas ’ car repair shop , where the gas sent him and his brother scrambling for cover , Rojas said .
Up the hill on the same day , 15 - year - old Juanita Gonzalez was washing dishes when several devices exploded on her patio , sending spray and smoke through the open window , she said .
Gonzalez said she fled with her baby brothers , joining several other families rushing to evacuate on the block .
“ My face was burning , ” said Gonzalez , who had to be helped out of the house because she was having trouble breathing .
“ I felt like I was drowning . ”
Argumeo , the woman whose home has been gassed three times , said that after one incident , her 12 - year - old son had nosebleeds for a week .
Her neighbor , Ramiro Lopez , said an errant explosive shattered his car window before exploding .
The car is the least of his worries , he said .
“ Something has to be done -- more than anything , for the children . ”

' War criminal ' cries get protesters quickly removed from hearing

As soon as Rep .
Ike Skelton gaveled a joint Congressional hearing to order this morning , protesters could be heard yelling " war criminal " at Army Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker , who were about to testify about conditions in Iraq .
At least one woman could be heard shouting briefly , before Skelton ( D - MO ) ordered anyone who disrupted the proceedings to be removed from the hearing room .
" Out they go , " Skelton said .
He paused a few seconds , then asked no one in particular , " Are they gone ? "
At least a half - dozen protesters were arrested during the course of Monday 's hearing , and their presence visibly iritated Skelton .
 That really pisses me off down there , Those assholes ,  a sharp - eared Wall Street Journal reporter overheard Skelton say to the committees ranking Republican member Duncan Hunter of California .
A staffer came to the rescue later , shutting off Skelton 's microphone .
Members of the anti-war group Code Pink have been a near constant presence at hearings on the Iraq war , and several members have been removed from hearings and arrested for other Capitol Hill protests .
It was not clear who was removed Monday , nor whether they were arrested or will face criminal charges .
Petraeus and Crocker are making their first appearance on the Hill Monday to assess the results of President Bush 's troop surge , which began earlier this year .
Later in the hearing more protesters were removed , including one who appeared to be Adam Kokesh , an Iraq veteran who has become a leading figure in the anti-war movement .
Several more Code Pink members and other anti-war activists remained in the hearing room , and some members worried about further disruptions .
As Petraeus was delivering his testimony , another protester began shouting , " That 's a lie , " as Petraeus accused Iran of supporting insurgents in Iraq .
" Would the entire group that 's back there supporting that person be removed , " Skelton requested .

The following video is from MSNBC's News Live , broadcast on September 10 .
Imagine you were corrupt , and imagine you were a politician .
But I repeat myself .
Jacob Zuma , the women - abusing , criminal thug darling of the African National Congress , has become the new president of the ANC .
Since , in South Africa , it is the party which runs the country ( rather than , in more civilised lands , where elected politicians run the country ) this – effectively – puts Zuma in charge .
The Scorpions are South Africa ’s elite police service , a version of the US FBI .
They are tasked with tackling corruption at the highest levels .
They are about to file criminal proceedings against Zuma on bribery charges related to the government ’s multi-billion Dollar arms deal scandal .
The first act of Zuma is to scrap the Scorpions .
The unit is to be disbanded within months .
Note that this is a decision of the ANC – not parliament .
Rather like the Republicans deciding that the FBI are getting too close and shutting the organisation down without going through Congress .
More interestingly is who is the king behind the thrown throne .
Most commentators ( including your humble servant , esq ) agree that Zuma is too dumb to swallow his own saliva .
So the real power rests in his newly elected deputy , Kgalema Motlanthe .
Two years ago a bank set up by the ANC – the Land Bank – aimed at providing loans to aspirant farmers lent 40 % of its total equity – R 800 million – to one company .
That company “ lost ” the lot .
The primary shareholder in that company ?
Ah , yes , that would be Motlanthe .
To date no - one has had to answer in any way for this bit of corruption .
Run Forrest , Run .
You know what I really like ?
TripIt.com .
It ’s amazingly simple .
You take all those travel confirmation emails that you get from your travel agent , hotels , car rental agencies , etc , and you just forward them to plans@tripit.com .
That ’s all you have to do .
You do n’t have to sign up for an account .
You do n’t have to log on .
You just forward those emails .
You can do it right now .
You get a link back by email , with a beautifully organized itinerary , showing all your travel data plus maps , weather reports , and all the confirmation numbers for your flights and address for your hotels and so on .
It ’s kind of magical .
You do n’t have to fill out lots of little fields with all the details , because they ’ve done a lot of work to parse those confirmation emails correctly … it worked flawlessly for my upcoming trip to Japan .
Think of it this way .
Suppose you want to enter a round trip flight on your calendar .
The minimum information you need to enter is probably :
the airline the flight number four times ( departure and arrival , there and back ) four time zones ( or else your phone will tell you that your flight is at 5 pm when it ’s really at 2 pm ) a confirmation number ( for when the airline denies that you exist ) where you ’re going
All in all it takes a few minutes and is very error prone .
Whereas , with TripIt , you just take that email from the airline or Orbitz , Ctrl + F , type plans@tripit.com , and send .
Done .
TripIt is a beautiful example of the Figure It Out school of user interface design .
Why should you need to register ?
TripIt figures out who you are based on your email address .
Why should you parse the schedule data ?
Everyone gets email from the same 4 online travel agencies , 100 - odd airlines , 15 hotel chains , 5 car rental chains … it ’s pretty easy to just write screen scrapers for each of those to parse out the necessary data .
Anyway , it ’s a shame I have to say this , but I have no connection whatsoever to tripit.com .
That 's interesting coming from a person who helped re-elect the Bush / Cheney team and in my eyes is just as responsible for the GOP " soul " problem as anyone else .
It was Peggy that said back in 2000 : " we ca n’t afford another famous liar in the White House . "
Lying a country into war has n't seemed to bother her all that much .
Noonan carefully frames her criticism of BushCo starting in 2004 --- as if they suddenly changed after that election .

Robert Elisberg called Peggy out on HuffPo :
Unfortunately , Ms. Noonan , there is little hidden intelligence that Democrats have n't been yelling about publicly for years .
There publicly were no WMDs in Iraq when we went to war - yet you made your " grand bargain " and still supported George Bush .
The budget deficit and national debt were massive - and public - yet you and your Republican party made its " grand bargain " and supported tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans .
It was public that there were no links between Iraq and 9/11 , but you made your " grand bargain " to support George Bush and blast as traitors and cowards anyone who dared say otherwise .
And when an agent whose job was specifically to know more than others - and tell her superiors about that deep inside intelligence - was outed by people even George Bush last Thursday acknowledged were " probably " in his Administration - you Republicans had long - since made your " grand bargain " and defended the White House .
And then she complains about dynasties .
Once again she forgets her role in perpetuating the Bush family dynasty .
Peggy , if you think the Republican party does indeed have a soul problem , then I 'd suggest you lead the way and if it 's possible find your own soul first .
MSNBC : MTP Transcript
MS. NOONAN : May I just throw in here that I think the Republicans have a tough time this year .
The Democratic Party is trying to figure out of two candidates which one will take them to success , take them to the White House .
The Republican Party is trying to refind its soul .
And in looking at each state , at each of these guys , they 're thinking " is this the guy who reflects what conservatism is -- what modern conservatism is , what this party is , and the next day they think , " maybe it 's this guy . "
It is a much tougher thing to find your soul than it is to find success .
So I think the Republicans are really going to be struggling for a while .
I also think , Jon , I must say , I think what has happened with the conservative coalition is that it has been sundered .
I think it was sundered by this administration from 2004 on through a series of decisions that were not just at odds with , but deeply defined of and rejecting of the feelings , thoughts and views of Republicans and conservatives .
And to make it even worse , the Congress , when it was under Republican hands and now Democratic hands , was just as defiant , just as at odds with the feelings of so many people about what it is that is most reflective of conservatism in the Republican Party .
So I think Republicans have taken a beating in a way and they - - I mean , almost a psychic beating , and they are trying really hard to redefine and come back .
It 's going to be a tough job .
MR. BROKAW : Republicans and Democrats alike .
I have never heard as many Republicans , gold - star , born and bred Republicans , so unhappy with the management of this country by a Republican president now .
MS. NOONAN : Totally true .
MR . BROKAW : And I think that when she played the competence card and the experience card , it 's measured against that .
MS. GOODWIN : Right .
MR . BROKAW : We do n't want to go back into an unknown again .
Here is somebody who does know what she 's doing .
That does pop up in the polls .
But the counterweight to it , of course , is still not entirely comfortable with her .
I have questions about her character and concern about whether she can win .
MS. NOONAN : May I say , dynasticism is part of this , too ?
MS. GOODWIN : Oh , yeah .
MS. NOONAN : We have n't mentioned it , but there is this Bush , Clinton , Bush , Clinton - - I 've called it a sickness .
It is an odd way for a great democracy to comport itself in this strange -- we have dynasties now backed by lobbyists , backed by machines and machinery .
The fact that America 's doing this is giving so many people pause .
It us unlike us .
And I cannot help but think , as some people come forward and endorse on the Democratic side Mrs. Clinton , they must be thinking stop the dynasty .
I know Republicans are thinking stop the dynasties .
MR . BROKAW : But on NBC , you'd be happy with Russert , Brokaw , Russert , Brokaw .
That would be OK ?
MS. NOONAN : Forever , Tom. Forever .
Young was traded by Tampa Bay to Minnesota on Wednesday night as
part of a six - player deal that sent right - hander Matt Garza to the
Rays .
In a swap of promising youngsters that 's been discussed for
weeks , the Twins also gave up starting shortstop Jason Bartlett and
minor league pitcher Eduardo Morlan while acquiring shortstop
Brendan Harris and minor league outfielder Jason Pridie .
The deal was first reported by ESPN.com 's Keith Law .
" I 've grown up a lot over the last couple of years , " Young
said on a conference call with the Minnesota media .
" I 'm getting
older and wiser .
It 's going to happen with some players when you
are 18 years old , thrown into the world with a little money in your
pocket . "
While many in baseball have been waiting for Minnesota to make a
blockbuster deal , this was n't it .
The Twins are involved in trade
talks involving ace Johan Santana , who can become a free agent
after next season .
Young , though , was runner - up for AL Rookie of the Year this
season and gives Minnesota an athletic replacement for All - Star
Torii Hunter -- at least in the lineup if not in center field .
A seven - time Gold Glove winner , Hunter agreed to a $ 90 million ,
five - year contract with the Los Angeles Angels last week , leaving
the Twins in dire need of a proven outfielder .
" Coming into the offseason our first priority was to improve
our offense , " new Twins general manager Bill Smith said .
" We took
a hit last week when Torii left , but Delmon Young has been the guy
we 've been targeting since the end of the season .
We feel he is the
best bat available , and we 're excited to get him . "
In addition to the Young deal , the Rays are also close to a multiyear deal for reliever Troy Percival , ESPN The Magazine 's Buster Olney reports .
Young hit .288 with 13 homers and 93 RBIs in his first full
major league season , though he walked only 26 times with 127
strikeouts .
He also had 38 doubles and 10 steals .
Young , however , has a hotheaded history for a 22 - year - old .
The
first overall pick in the 2003 draft famously flipped his bat into
the chest of a Triple - A umpire in 2006 and received a 50 - game
suspension for that .
He got a three - game ban in 2005 for bumping an
umpire in Double - A .
He also argued with Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon during a
late - season game after he was removed for not running out a
grounder .
But Young has unquestionable talent , possessing a rocket arm
from his natural spot in right field .
He also played center as an
injury fill - in , appearing in all 162 games and compiling 16
outfield assists .
" He 's got one bad incident on his record .
He made a terrible
mistake , " Smith said .
" We 've done a lot of work on his makeup ,
and we 've had an awful lot of people tell us he 's a very good
teammate , he 's a fierce competitor , he wants to win , and he's the
first one to arrive at the ballpark every day . "
Garza gives the Rays , who need help for their rotation , a
legitimate starter .
One of the game 's top prospects , Garza went 5 - 7
with a 3.69 ERA in 16 appearances , 15 starts , for Minnesota after
he was called up right before the All - Star break .
" He 's a guy we project to get a lot better quickly , " Rays
executive vice president Andrew Friedman said .
" We feel like we
strengthened two areas of need , shortstop and starting pitching . "
Garza was excited after speaking with Friedman .
" He 's ready to roll .
That 's what I like to hear .
He made me
feel at home , and all I can feel is that things are pointed on the
up and up , " Garza said from his home in Fresno , Calif .
" It 'll be
fun to see how it plays out . "
Upset by his exclusion from the Opening Day roster in the
spring , Garza threw 15 straight scoreless innings after he was
promoted from Triple - A this year .
He also made 10 appearances for
Minnesota in 2006 .
Friedman expects Bartlett to be the Opening Day shortstop and
Garza to fit nicely next to Scott Kazmir and James Shields , two
other young starters .
The other two spots in the rotation will be
open to competition in spring training .
" The trade is about the present , not the future .
We 're a better
ballclub because of this deal , " Friedman said .
" To get good young
players you have to give up something good , and that 's what we
did . "
Garza was Minnesota 's first - round draft pick in 2005 , and the
hard - throwing righty out of Fresno State breezed through the minors
to earn time with the Twins the following season .
His velocity reaches the mid-90 mph range , but the 24 - year - old
has frustrated his coaches and managers the past two years by
relying too much on his fastball without mixing in enough off - speed
and breaking pitches to be effective in the majors .
He is 8 - 13 with a 4.47 ERA in 26 appearances -- including 24
starts -- with the Twins .
He has issued 55 walks in 133 innings , and
opponents have hit .297 against him .
The good news for Garza is that Tampa Bay plays at Minnesota
only twice in 2008 , April 16 - 17 .
He is 1 - 10 with a 5.91 ERA in 13
career appearances at the Metrodome .
The Bartlett - for - Harris shortstop section of the swap gives the
Twins a 27 - year - old in exchange for a 28 - year - old .
In his first
full season as a starter , Harris hit .286 with 12 homers , 35
doubles and 59 RBIs in 521 at - bats .
From 2004 - 06 , he played for
three teams : the Cubs , Expos / Nationals and Reds .
" You 've got to produce , " Harris said .
" It 's an offensive game
now .
Everybody 's got to pull their weight at the dish .
At the same
time , I view myself as a solid defensive player . "
Bartlett was a late bloomer who finally became a regular when he
was called up in June 2006 .
He gave the lineup a legitimate spark
that year and batted .309 in 333 at - bats for a playoff - bound team .
Like many of the Twins , though , he slumped in 2007 and finished
with a .265 average , five homers , 43 RBIs and 23 steals in 510
at - bats .
He made 26 errors .
Harris had only 11 errors last season .
Pridie , a center fielder , was taken by the Twins in the 2005
winter meeting draft .
When he did n't make the team out of spring
training he was returned to Tampa Bay and spent the past two
seasons in the minors .
Friedman called the right - handed Morlan " one of the best young
bullpen prospects out there . "
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
As the economy slows many people from Larry Summers to Martin Feldstein are calling for a fiscal stimulus .
I am not convinced .
Spending and tax decisions can
rarely boost an economy .
First , the money for any new spending or tax cuts has got to come from somewhere , right ?
Thus there is usually substantial crowding out of any stimulus .
Second , by the time the new spending or tax cut
gets through the political process the economy has moved on and the
stimulus is no longer relevant except by accident .
Third , there just
is n’t that much discretionary spending to play with and even a large
increase in spending , say tens of billions , is too small to make much of
a difference in a 13 trillion dollar economy .
Fourth , in their desperation to " do
something " politicians will often do something foolish .
If a spending
increase or tax cut is n’t worthwhile on its own merits then it ’s highly
unlikely to be worthwhile once we add in the benefits of " stimulus . "
Thus , it ’s one thing to argue for extending unemployment benefits as a matter of welfare it ’s quite another to think that an increase in unemployment benefits will so increase spending as to reduce unemployment !
( The implicit view of Larry Summers . )
Economists may call for " temporary , " " conditional , " and " targeted " stimulus but they wo n’t be the ones designing the plan .
Spending
increases and tax cuts are policies with long term
consequences that we need to think about carefully .
Thus , I do not favor a fiscal " stimulus "
package .
Women are being advised to cut out caffeine during the first three months of pregnancy , to help reduce their risk of having a miscarriage .
The warning follows a study that found pregnant women who consumed two or more mugs of coffee a day were twice as likely to miscarry than those who abstained from caffeine completely .
The study of 1,063 pregnant women showed that those who had at least 200 mg of caffeine each day had a 25 % risk of miscarriage compared with a 12 % risk for women who avoided all caffeine , including in tea , soft drinks and chocolate .
The advice , from doctors at one of America 's largest private health organisations , goes further than guidelines introduced by British government health officials in 2001 .
These recommend that pregnant women limit their daily intake to 300mg .
The government advice was based on a Food Standards Agency review of the scientific literature , which found an increased risk where caffeine intake was highter than 300 mg a day - or three cups of instant coffee - in the first 15 weeks .
Fresh coffee is typically stronger than instant , and a cup of tea has around 40mg .
" It appears that 200 mg a day is already a high enough dose to increase the risk of miscarriage , " said Dr De-Kun Li , a perinatal epidemiologist who led the study at Kaiser Permanente , a California - based non-profit health foundation that runs 32 hospitals .
He advised women to consider not consuming caffeine or at least limiting their intake to less than 200 mg during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy .
The women were asked what they had eaten and drunk until the 20th week of gestation : 635 had up to 200 mg a day ; 164 women had 200 mg or more daily ; and 264 had none .
The doctors accounted for other factors known to affect miscarriage rates , including age , income , a history of miscarriages , smoking and alcohol consumption .
Overall , 172 women miscarried , 95 % within the first 15 weeks of pregnancy .
The results suggested that even moderate amounts of caffeine increased the risk , but this was only confirmed in women who consumed 200 mg or more a day .
It made no difference whether the caffeine came from coffee , tea , chocolate or cola drinks .
Li called on GPs to encourage patients to reduce or give up caffeine during early pregnancy .
It is unclear why caffeine should affect early pregnancy , although it is known that pregnant women take longer to process caffeine and it can cross the placenta into a baby 's bloodstream .
The latest study , in the current online issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , accounted for this " pregnancy - related caffeine aversion " - which Li said had hampered previous studies - by following women who did not change their drinking habits .
High levels of caffeine have previously been linked to increased risk of premature birth and small babies .
But a Danish study last year found no difference where mothers had drunk only moderate amounts of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee .
Tracy Flanagan , director of women 's health at Kaiser Permanente in northern California , advised pregnant women to consider switching to decaffeinated drinks , and natural energy boosts , such as a brisk walk , yoga or dried fruit .
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said : " We are constantly reviewing and updating our advice , but at this time , our guideline limit of 300 mg of caffeine remains . "
The guidelines also suggest pregnant women try decaffeinated drinks where possible .
The effects
Caffeine occurs naturally in a range of foods , such as coffee , tea and chocolate , and is added to soft drinks such as Red Bull .
Cold remedies and antihistamines use it to counter the drowsy effects of other ingredients .
Caffeine raises the heart rate and metabolism .
It is a diuretic that causes the body to lose water , other fluids and calcium .
Tea hinders the ability to absorb iron if drunk near a meal .
Babies find it hard to excrete .
SOFIA ( Reuters ) -
The trafficking of Bulgarian women as sex slaves brings in about 1.8 billion euros ( $ 2.6 billion ) a year for the gangs behind it , making it the country ’s most profitable criminal activity , a report said on Wednesday .

The European Union newcomer has become one of the main exporters of sex workers to Western Europe along with Russia , Ukraine and Romania , the independent non-government Centre for the Study of Democracy ( CSD ) said in a report .
Bulgaria ranked first according to the number of victims who sought help in the Netherlands in 2000 - 2003 and was number three in Germany in 2001 - 2005 , the report said , citing European data .
Analysts from the group blamed poverty , corruption , family problems , a failing justice system and Bulgaria ’s geographic location -- along numerous illegal trade routes in the Black Sea region -- for fuelling the sex industry .
The Bulgarian government recently abandoned a plan to legalize prostitution , a step taken by other EU countries such as the Netherlands , saying it would only make the problem worse .
“ It would be a grave mistake , ” Interior Minister Roumen Petkov said during a presentation of the CSD report .
“ It would mean that abusing human flesh is lawful and would create conditions to legalize huge amounts of money to be re-invested in criminal activities . ”
He said Bulgaria should take a tougher stance against human trafficking and step up measures to fight the problem .
There are no official estimates of the number of Bulgarian women working as sex slaves abroad but some groups believe about 10,000 to 12,000 fall victim to trafficking every year .
The CSD report said profits from prostitution at home stood at between 110 and 170 million levs ( $ 83 - 129 million ) .
In a press release , Paul Mason , Children 's Commissioner , says non-medical circumcision is a breach of human rights .
And the AMA 's President , Haydn Walters , says they would support a ban on the practice , except where there are medical or religious reasons .
He says there is only rarely a medical need to carry out the procedure .
" There were quite a lot of folk myths around the advantages of circumcision .
They 've almost all been debunked , " Prof Walters said .
"
There are some minimal advantages in some circumstances , particularly in some infectious diseases , but they 're overwhelmingly balanced by disadvantages in other areas , " he added .
For those interested in un-circumcision , there are new tools , among them the TLC Tugger .
( Warning , explicit images of foreskin regrowth . )
And , since this post is getting some serious traffic , no , I 'm not trying to sell the " Tugger " and simply thought the whole thing was hilarious .
In fact , there are quite a few products in this growing area . . .
4restore.com is another one .
You tape whatever is left onto the steel thingy , then pull .
They sell their stainless steel contraption with the following words :
" When a man is circumcised , he loses the protection that is essential to protecting the nerves on the head of the penis .
The surface of the glans penis is not skin but a thin mucus membrane .
When exposed to constant friction and abrasion to clothing or the harshness of drying from the air , it loses sensitivity because the glans develops a layer of protective tissue to make up for the lack of foreskin . " " Restoring the foreskin will help you regain that lost sensitivity , making sex more enjoyable and making the experience highly sensual .
Uncircumcised men enjoy more sensitivity at the head of the penis because their nerves are kept fresh and protected in a warm and moist environment .
They also report having more comfortable erections because of the extra shaft skin that is built when the foreskin retracts . "

I 'm the lucky one that got the ticket to deliver your pizza .
Customer service told you it would be at your door in 30 minutes , I noticed that I was walking out the door with your hot from the oven pizza at the 35 minute mark .
That happens sometimes , we get a little behind , especially when Monday Night Football is on .
So I show up at your door about 10 minutes late for the 30 minute promise .
You did n't seem upset by it being late , and the transaction continued .
I politely told you the total was $ 29 , you handed me $ 30 , a $ 20 and a $ 10 .
I paused for a second , waiting for the customary " keep the change " , or " thanks , drive safe " , or even a silent shutting of the door .
But not from you : you just stood there , not asking for your change , but making it perfectly clear that you were waiting for something .
So I said , " Would you like your change ? " , to which you did n't reply , just kept standing there , so I dug into my pocket and found a single dollar bill , which I promptly handed to you .
I think the next and last thing I said to you was , " Enjoy your Pizza " , and this is where I was expecting you to finally , mercifully , shut the door and go back to your life and I would go back to mine .
But no , you were n't done yet .
If you had been done , I would n't have remembered you , I would have written you off like countless other snobby , cheap people that do n't feel that there is any value added in the act of me driving all the way to your warm , comfortable home so you do n't have to .
But you had one final act for me ; a smirk , which I roughly translated to mean " I 'm better than you , you penny groveling , minimum wage earning scum , you should be thankful that I graced you with my presence at my door for this brief interlude , now go away " So , young lady that lives in a beautiful home on Eagle River Road not far from Wal - Mart who does n't tip the Pizza Guy , I have a few nuggets of information for you to consider before you interact with another delivery driver : 1 .
If you had in fact given me the whole $ 1.00 change from your $ 29.00 order , that would have been a 3.4 % tip ; a small tip , but at least it 's something .
2 .
If you had waited at the door just a little longer , or asked for it , I would have been happy to give you the penny ( your order was in fact 28.99 and I only gave you one dollar back , I still owe you a penny ) .
3 . Incidentally , 1 penny for a $ 28.99 order amounts to a .0034 % tip .4 .
Most delivery drivers make minimum wage ( myself included ) .
I also get $ 1.50 per delivery from my employer to offset operating expenses of my vehicle .
With fuel more than $ 3 / gallon , I can at best expect to break even with this delivery fee .
We as delivery drivers actually expect to make the largest portion of our income from our tips .
Considering where your beautiful home is in relation to the pizza restaurant in question , I probably lost money delivering your hot , fresh pizza to you tonight .
5 .
On a given night , I expect to not get a tip on 20 % of my deliveries .
I find it most interesting that my most generous tippers live in mobile home courts , apartment complexes , and older , more established single family home neighborhoods .
Upscale neighborhoods with manicured shrubbery and BMWs in the driveway , not so much .
6 . Military members are the exception to this " housing determines tipping " theory .
If I see a military sticker in the window of a car in the driveway , I am never disappointed .
Apartment or mansion , those who serve a greater cause are very generous to those that serve pizza to their door .
Oh and about the penny that I still owe you .
You apparently need the money much more than I do ( first and foremost , I 'm active duty military , which as everybody knows , pays extremely well .
I only deliver pizza for the fun of it , not to make ends meet like you might expect ) .
Please reply to this post and I 'll be happy to personally deliver you one shiny penny .
Have a nice day , Your Friendly Eagle River Pizza Delivery Guy
December 27 is a day to celebrate the life of astronomer Johannes Kepler , who was born on this date in 1571 , and is best known for his three laws of planetary motion .
But also , coming up in 2009 , The International Year of Astronomy ( IYA ) will celebrate the work of Kepler as well .
Not only did Galileo begin his observations with a telescope almost 400 years ago in 1609 , but also in that year Kepler published his book New Astronomy or Astronomia Nova .
This was the first published work that documented the scientific method .
Kepler ’s primary reason for writing Astronomia Nova was to attempt to calculate the orbit of Mars .
Previous astronomers used geometric models to explain the positions of the planets , but Kepler sought for and discovered physical causes for planetary motion .
Kepler was the first astronomer to prove that the planets orbited the sun in elliptical paths and he did so with rigorous scientific arguments .
An offshoot of Astronomia Nova was the formulation of concepts that eventually became the first two of Kepler ’s Laws :
First Law :
The orbit of a planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun ’s center of mass at one focus .
Second Law : A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time .
And Kepler ’s third Law :
The squares of the periods of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their semi-major axes .
Kepler was also instrumental in the development of early telescopes .
He invented the convex eyepiece , which allowed an expanded field of vision , and discovered a means of determining the magnifying power of lenses .
He was the first to explain that the tides are caused by the Moon and the first to suggest that the Sun rotates about its axis .
He also was the first to use stellar parallax caused by the Earth ’s orbit to try to measure the distance to the stars .
While Kepler remains one of the greatest figures in astronomy , his endeavors were not just limited to this field .
He was the first person to develop eyeglasses designed for nearsightedness and farsightedness , the first to investigate the formation of pictures with a pin hole camera , and the first to use planetary cycles to calculate the birth year of Christ .
He also formed the basis of integral calculus .
Kepler ’s many books provided strong support for Galileo ’s discoveries , and Galileo wrote to him , “ I thank you because you were the first one , and practically the only one , to have complete faith in my assertions . ”

Defeating the Shoe Scanning Machine at Heathrow Airport
For a while now , Heathrow Airport has had a unique setup for scanning shoes .
Instead of taking your shoes off during the normal screening process , as you do in U.S. airports , you go through the metal detector with your shoes on .
Then , later , there is a special shoe scanning X - ray machine .
You take your shoes off , send them through the machine , and put them on at the other end .
It ’s definitely faster , but it ’s an easy system to defeat .
The vulnerability is that no one verifies that the shoes you walked through the metal detector with are the same shoes you put on the scanning machine .
Here ’s how the attack works .
Assume that you have two pairs of shoes : a clean pair that passes all levels of screening , and a dangerous pair that does n’t .
( Ignore for a moment the ridiculousness of screening shoes in the first place , and assume that an X - ray machine can detect the dangerous pair . )
Put the dangerous shoes on your feet and the clean shoes in your carry - on bag .
Walk through the metal detector .
Then , at the shoe X - ray machine , take the dangerous shoes off and put them in your bag , and take the clean shoes out of your bag and place them on the X - ray machine .
You ’ve now managed to get through security without having your shoes screened .
This works because the two security systems are decoupled .
And the shoe screening machine is so crowded and chaotic , and so poorly manned , that no one notices the switch .
U.S. airports force people to put their shoes through the X - ray machine and walk through the metal detector shoeless , ensuring that all shoes get screened .
That might be slower , but it works .
EDITED TO ADD ( 12/14 ) : Heathrow Terminal 3 , that is .
The system was n’t in place in Terminal 4 , and I do n’t know about Terminals 1 and 2 .

CARLETONVILLE , South Africa ( CNN ) --
Hundreds of workers from a South African gold mine returned to the surface Thursday morning after power to the mine was restored , following an accident that kept them underground for more than a day , the company operating the mine told CNN .
" I 'm happy now because we are out and we are alive , " said Granny Makau , one of the miners who was trapped inside Elandstrand New Mine , north of Johannesburg .
" No one died so we are happy . "
A slow and deliberate rescue operation was underway but it was expected to take until Thursday afternoon before all 3,200 workers would see daylight again .
More than a thousand had surfaced by mid morning .
" I thought maybe it would take three days or four days ( to get out ) , but I 'm happy now that I 'm out and everybody is OK , " Makau said .
Harmony Gold Mining Company President Graham Briggs , whose company oversees mining operations there , echoed those sentiments .
" It 's really a nice sight to see people come out from underground , " he said .
" It 's always difficult when you 've got a situation where you 've got people underground and they should be on the surface . "
Video footage at the mouth of the mine showed workers in hard hats and overalls , exiting a small secondary shaft in groups of about 75 .
As each lift surfaced , paramedics were seen offering food , water and medical attention , if necessary .
In addition , paramedics have entered the mine and are treating workers waiting to leave .
The workers were trapped in the cavernous mine -- which is built like an underground city complete with trains , trucks and cars -- after broken water pipe knocked out electricity to the mine about 6 a.m. Wednesday ( midnight Tuesday ET ) , shutting down power to the elevators , South Africa 's ambassador to the United States , Welile Nhlapo told CNN .
The miners were trapped more than 2 kilometers ( 1.3 miles ) underground , according to Lesiba Sheshoka , a spokesman for the South Africa 's National Union of Mineworkers .
They were " quite safe " and were given food and water , Nhlapo said .
" This was a situation where the people were not really in danger , they were underground , " Briggs told CNN on Thursday .
" They were n't in personal danger at any time ... this is a delay in getting people to surface .
It 's not really an accident in the sense of an underground accident , in the sense of a falling rock . "
Although Sheshoka said he could not speak specifically about the conditions at the Elandstrand mine , he pointed to what he called South Africa 's generally poor mine safety record .
Do n't Miss Families of Utah miners speak out
According to an official South African government Web site , 202 workers died in mine accidents in 2005 , with another 3,961 suffering injuries .
" We 're not proud of those statistics at all , " Briggs said , in response to the nationwide numbers .
" At Harmony , we have improved over the last three years but we need to keep working at it and keep improving it . "
In the past decade mine safety across South Africa has shown improvement .
According to the government 's Web site , the 2005 safety numbers were a great improvement from 1995 , when 533 miners died and 7,000 were injured .
The government pledges further improvements to reduce those numbers .

Brett Rypien to start for Denver Broncos against New York Jets
On Thursday night against the Jets , Brett Rypien will be the ninth different quarterback to start a game for the Broncos since the start of the 2017 season .
You know what it ’s like to get an X - ray done : you go to the doctor , get in a large machine , she puts on a lead vest , and X - rays shoot through your body , forming a picture of your skeletal structure .
Well , using the IceCube neutrino detector â€ “ as well as other neutrino detectors to come â€ “ it might be possible to do something very similar to this , but to the Earth .
A collaborative team of physicists and geologists from around the world has proposed that with the construction of IceCube , a neutrino detector at the South Pole , it should be possible to get a very accurate picture of the Earth ’s core using neutrinos that stream through the Earth from the other side .
Their recent paper is entitled Imaging the Internal Structure of the Earth with Atmospheric Neutrinos .
Neutrinos are particles with very small mass that do n’t interact with other types of matter very often .
There are trillions of them streaming through your body this very second , but do n’t worry : the chance that they will interact with any of the protons or neutrons that make up your body are very , very low .
The higher the energy of the neutrino , the more likely it is to interact with a particle that has mass .
When this happens a cascade of other particles is created , and a particle called a muon that is produced by this reaction can be detected .
Neutrino telescopes do n’t look anything like your average viewing telescopes ; rather , they are made up of a huge block of matter , usually water or ice .
IceCube is just such a detector , made up of one cubic km of ice at the South Pole .
There are small “ strings ” of detectors placed strategically in the ice to record the presence of muons from neutrino - particle interactions .
The large mass of the detector increases the likelihood of finding the collisions between neutrinos and other particles .
The idea to use neutrinos as a way to image Earth ’s interior has been around for more than 25 years , but IceCube is the first neutrino telescope with the ability to detect neutrinos at the energies necessary to give an accurate picture of the core .
Using IceCube to view the inside the Earth would increase our understanding of the “ core - mantle transition ” â€ “ where the Earth ’s core meets the mantle â€ “ because this method is more accurate than methods currently used to estimate what the inside of the Earth looks like .
Dr. Francis Halzen of the University of Wisconsin Department of Physics , one of the co-authors of the research paper proposes , “ we can see the transition “ directly ” and not infer it from some analysis of indirect data , such as data on Earth sound waves .
The precision of our mapping is directly related to our angular resolution on the path taken through the Earth by a neutrino . ”
Much like in an X - ray , some of the neutrinos coming through the Earth would be blocked by the dense core â€ “ like the Earth ’s “ skeleton ” â€ “ while those streaming through the mantle , which is less dense , would be detected by IceCube .
Though the IceCube telescope is still under construction , it has already begun taking data , and will only continue to improve as more detectors are added to the ice .
Dr. Halzen said , “ An unusual feature of IceCube is that we operate the partially deployed detector while we are constructing it .
We have been collecting data relevant to this problem for more than 1 year and hope to run half the detector starting this February , i.e. after another construction season over the Antarctic summer that just started . ”
The imaging is expected to be finished anywhere between the next 3 and 10 years .

Many people are unsatisfied with the existing ways of font display systems on Linux .
A research paper from Anti-Grain now showed easy but powerful text rasterization improvements .
However , the answer from the FreeType developers is a bit sobering .
It is often mentioned that Fonts look ugly on Linux .
While I cannot really understand that drastic statement ( using DejaVu fonts ) there certainly is room for improvements .
Anti-Grain ’s suggestions
Maxim Shemanarev from Anti-Grain now looked into the issue and suggested a set of simple but powerful , not patented methods to improve this situation drastically .
He outlines the advantages as follows :
You can kern symbols with sub - pixel precision , not worrying about introducing extra blurriness .
You can freely scale the text as you want , with 100 % guarantee of preserving a stable text layout that always fits other graphic elements .
You can always be sure that the calculated text width exactly corresponds with what you will see on screen and paper .
You can apply fancy vector effects such as “ faux bold ” and “ faux italic ” being sure the text will not look any blurrier .
The paper mentions an interesting point : the free scaling of fonts and the stable , calculated text width are things which are not usual on today desktops .
For example , fonts scaling on Windows XP seems to be a nightmare .
Also , the distance between two chars is not constant for example in Word .
So the rasterization cannot only be improved on Linux but on Windows as well .
The way to do so is :
Use horizontal RGB sub - pixel anti-aliasing for LCD flat panels .
Use vertical hinting only and completely discard the horizontal one .
Use accurate glyph advance values , calculated at a high resolution for unhinted glyphs .
Use accurate , high resolution values from the kerning table .
The paper itself shows numerous examples of blurry , not improved fonts and improved fonts .
And the results do look pretty , even for an untrained eye .
Besides , the articles gives a pretty good overview about text rendering on the different platforms .
FreeTypes answer
However , the question is now if these suggestions will hit the Desktop anytime soon .
According to the FreeType developer David Turner this might not be the case due to different reasons .
First of all backwards compatibility might be a showstopper :
And the same problem will happen on Linux if you want to implement sub - pixel positioning , because most of the GUI toolkits out there cannot deal with it correctly .
And some applications will not work correctly anymore if you change the toolkit .
Backwards compatibility is a bitch 🙂
But there are also technical reasons .
According to David Turner FreeType already supports techniques to deal with some mentioned problems like the inter-character spacing .
Also , the suggested method to hint only in the vertical direction is already available in FreeType and is called “ light hinting ” .
Another , more general problem is that the layout toolkits using FreeType lack support of some of the techniques which would come in handy : sub -pixel glyph positioning and support for kerning and auto - kerning seems to be missing in the important libraries ( which are Pango , LibXft , Qt , Cairo , poppler and others ) .
But getting such patches upstream seems to be quite difficult , David is “ tired of this ” .
Outlook
While the discussion continues it looks like that in the long term the major toolkits have to get together to talk about implementing the mentioned techniques .
Or , as suggested by David , a initiative dedicated to bringing patches upstream is launched .
It could try to work with upstream on the one hand , but with the distributors on the other hand – if the users see the results because the distributions include the patches it might help influencing the decision of upstream .
But there is no way of reaching perfect font rasterization with changes in FreeType only .
When this nation finds itself between two paths , republic or empire , we are slowly realizing that we have no moral compass to find our way home .
Our nation , once a proud representative republic , has had leaders from all walks of life , from all of our major political parties , that have surfaced to guide America and protect her from the excesses that ambition and power can bring to a proud nation .
We have managed to tread the waters of uncertainty and fear through threatening times ; wars , economic instability , ambitious politicians and even foreign ideologies that have stood in opposition against the principles of what we stand for .
Sometimes the road has been difficult and we have made many mistakes as a nation .
There have been times when we as a people have seemingly lost our way , succumbing to excess and greed .
We have interfered with other nation ’s right of self - determination when it was in our own interests to do so .
We destroyed an entire culture that once lived in America , destroying their civilization .
We have fought wars that were imperialistic in nature , only to realize later that this nation had no right to impose our will and beliefs on people in other lands that we barely understood .
We have made many mistakes as we have traveled on our historical journey , and these mistakes have been recognized and debated in this open society that we have developed over the years since we declared our right to be independent and free .
Sometimes when we seemingly lost our way , it was a long time before we could admit that the path we chose was the wrong path .
This is one of the most important facets of our culture .
We as a people have been able to admit and understand when we have acted outside of our own moral values .
We as a civilization have held this nation to a higher moral standard .
This moral standard is embedded in our values and our culture .
This morality has a document that illustrates our purpose ; The Declaration of Independence , our moral code comes from our Constitution .
When faced with enormous responsibility of guiding such a preeminent economic and military power in the world , this nation has always returned to the Constitution as a tool to guide us , not only in legal issues , but in moral issues when the road ahead seems to be unfathomable .
At this point in time , America seems to be lost .
We engage in “ faith - based principles ” instead of the rule of law .
No longer are the principles and the law , as stated in our constitution , being followed .
We use torture , we are engaged in a war of aggression against a sovereign nation long after our goal in that war , in this case regime change , have been met .
We have a government that openly defies our own laws as set forth in our constitution and we are spying on our own people without due process .
We have heard charges that some of our elected representatives in Congress and that people in our State Department have been selling nuclear technology to the highest bidder .
Sibel Edmonds , a former Turkish and Farsi interpreter employed by our government , has testified to Congress about these matters , and in return she was placed under a gag order and our own press has refused to cover the story .
The story had to break in The London Times because our own press decided to censure itself .
Our nation ’s media seems disinterested in nuclear proliferation for profit , yet we threaten war with Iran for building nuclear reactors for energy as if this was the greatest threat mankind faces .
We are faced with a “ thought crimes prevention bill ” S -1959 that states the purpose of this Act :
' (1 ) Examine and report upon the facts and causes of violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism , and ideologically based violence in the United States , including United States connections to non-United States persons and networks , violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism , and ideologically based violence in prison , individual or ' lone wolf ' violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism , and ideologically based violence , and other faces of the phenomena of violent radicalization , homegrown terrorism , and ideologically based violence that the Commission considers important .
Is this an ambiguous purpose for this Act or am I being overly suspect ?
Who will make up this Commission and who will be found to promote “ violent radicalization ” because of their views ?
This law is very similar to the “ Enabling Laws ” that were introduced in Germany during the period of the Third Reich .
This piece of legislation is much too open to interpretation and has no place in America .
We already have laws pertaining to every conceivable act of violence ; we do n’t need a law to protect society from the people that might offer up radical solutions to major problems .
Our own nation was founded by individuals that had leanings that at that time were believed to be “ radical ” .
We have learned by our own lessons in history that the “ radical ” thoughts and actions of today may conceivably be thought the “ voice of reason ” tomorrow .
We are engaged in a presidential election that is beset by troubling facts about the way our elections are run .
There are many states that use electronic voting that is susceptible to voting fraud by manipulating the way results of the vote can be fixed , with no paper trail to verify the true results .
This has been an issue that many in Congress along with many journalists have decried as totally unacceptable .
This is an issue that has many people in our country wondering if their vote will be counted .
We have seen numerous cases of lost ballots , votes that do n’t agree with the exit polling and other voting irregularities that are totally unconscionable in this day and age .
Once the electorate feels that their vote may be meaningless , their faith in representative government is gone .
This is an issue that must be swiftly and decidedly dealt with , even if it means that election results must be delayed until all votes are hand counted with a verification process that is inscrutable .
The fact is that anything less could cause the results of an election to be unverifiable and could be the catalyst for a total breakdown in voter confidence that in some countries has led to revolution .

After racking up more than $ 100 billion in mortgage - related losses in recent months , banks and their investors had hoped they were out of the woods .
They are n't .
UBS AG 's warning yesterday that its 2007 write - downs would be $ 4 billion higher than it predicted last month signaled that further pain may lie ahead for Wall Street banks still vulnerable to the U.S. housing sector 's strife .
Meanwhile , ...
LOS ANGELES — Jerry Alonzy figured he'd be working into his 70s at least .
As an independent handyman at the mercy of weather patterns near Hartford , Conn. , he 'd always made a decent income that rarely grew .
Then he found Google and his life changed .
Alonzy , 57 , now makes $ 120,000 a year from the ads Google places on his Natural Handyman website , and he could n't be more thrilled .
" I put in two , maybe three hours a day on the site , and the checks pour in , " he says .
" What 's not to like ? "
In return for placing its ads on websites and blogs , Google pays Web publishers every time one of its ads are clicked .
Those clicks help keep Alonzy and his wife living comfortably and talking about moving to Hawaii .
" All I need is a laptop and a high - speed Internet connection , and I can live anywhere . "
The Internet may be a young person 's medium , but the retired and those nearing retirement such as Alonzy have found that they can work the Web just as well .
Sometimes , such " Gray Googlers " can live a richer , more financially rewarding life than when they were supposedly working .
" Google is n't just for kids anymore , " says Google executive Kim Scott , who runs the company 's AdSense program , the ad platform that provides the income for Web publishers such as Alonzy and others .
Take Jerrold Foutz .
The former Boeing engineer , 75 , started a website a few years ago devoted to one of his passions — switching mode power supplies , which help drive , for instance , the inside of video cameras .
He put Google ads on his smpstech.com site four years ago .
After just one month , the first Google check was for $ 800 .
The second check totaled $ 2,000 .
" I thought , ' Wow , ' " he said .
" This was the most amazing thing that ever happened to me .
Something I thought would make $ 50 a year now equals my Boeing retirement check . "
That comes out to around $ 25,000 yearly .
Foutz 's experience is not an anomaly .
After Hope Pryor 's four kids left home , she grew intrigued with the Internet and learned how to design a Web page .
She did n't want it to focus on just her , so she posted some of her favorite recipes on the site .
Now , her Cooks Recipes site is bringing in nearly $ 90,000 yearly , mostly from Google ads .
The holidays are the biggest - producing months of the year .
" Last December alone , I netted $ 30,000 from Google , " she says .
" There 's not too many people I know who can walk into a car dealership and buy two vehicles at one time .
I did just that recently . "
While the upside of working with AdSense sounds exhilarating , it 's not that way for everybody .
Scott says she posted an unsold novel on Google and earns about $ 5 a month from the AdSense ads on the site .
Al Needham , 74 , who runs a site about the care of bees ( bees- online.com ) from his home near Boston , reaps about $ 250 a month .
" Forget about getting rich overnight , " says Alonzy .
" It takes time to learn . "
Jennifer Slegg , a consultant whose JenSense blog is devoted to tips for using so - called contextual advertising , says the easy part is getting AdSense up and running .
Google provides computer code that must be copied and pasted onto a website .
Figuring out how to do that " is very easy for new publishers . "
Foutz says even if you 've never cut and pasted code before ( hint : On Windows PCs , highlight the text , press Control C to copy , then Control V to paste it ) , " Just follow what Google says .
They have very easy - to - understand instructions . "
Hard work , big reward
Introduced in 2003 , AdSense was an outgrowth of Google 's AdWords program , which put sponsored ads at the top of search results at Google 's own site .
Google created AdSense as a way to expand beyond search listings and onto hundreds of thousands of websites and blogs .
Google rivals Yahoo and MSN have similar programs , but they have found limited acceptance on the Web , where Google dominates both search , with more than 50 % market share , and search advertising , with 90 % .
Now everyone from big sites such as the New York Times and CNN.com to mom and pop operations such as Cooks Recipes and Natural Handyman have the familiar " Ads by Google " text - box somewhere on their site .
" With AdSense , we fund creativity on any topic , " says Google 's Scott .
" If you have a subject you know something about , write about it , find a like - minded audience on the Internet and we 'll take care of monetizing the content . "
Or , as Joel Comm , author of the AdSense guidebook The AdSense Code , puts it : " People are amazed .
They say , ' Really , all I have to do is write , Google will put ads on my site and pay me ? '
Yes , it 's that simple . "
There is a little more to it .
The folks who reap the biggest rewards put in long hours setting up their site and feeding it lots of content .
" Write about what you know , write like mad and often , " says Alonzy .
" The more you write , the more opportunities you have to make money .
If you post 500 pages on a topic , you 'll have 500 pages with ads , and many more potential clicks . "
Google 's computers scan the content on Web pages to match it with appropriate advertisers .
Articles on Alonzy 's website about how to keep mice away might result in ads for pest control services , while a recipe for turkey casserole at Cooks Recipes might generate ads for diet tips and beauty makeovers .
" The beauty of our system is that we have so many advertisers , " says Scott .
" The content may not change , but our ads change every day .
So you 'll always see something different there . "
Slegg says the biggest mistake new AdSense publishers make is clicking on AdSense ads — their own or others .
That 's a big no - no in Googleland , and can get you dumped from the program .
The computer wo n't break
Alonzy and other Gray Googlers say they have n't experienced any problems working in a young person 's world .
" Many people my age are scared of computers ; they think they 're going to break them , " says Needham .
" The computers are n't going to break .
But you wo n't find out unless you get in there and try . "
At $ 250 a month , Needham 's site generates revenue in line with its niche audience of folks who want to learn about bees .
" I bring in enough to fund a free vacation to Key West every year for the family , " says Needham , a retired Department of Defense employee .
One stumbling block for many people is translating a great idea into a nice - looking Web page .
In the past , creating a Web page required knowledge of complicated HTML computer code , or learning off - the - shelf Web design software such as Microsoft 's FrontPage or Adobe 's Dreamweaver .
Now , Google and Yahoo have free tools to create Web pages or blogs .
And many Internet website - hosting companies ( such as GoDaddy and Brinkster ) have online site creators that come as part of their monthly fees .
Apple 's iWeb is another such tool .
With these , AdSense can be automatically added to your pages with the click of a mouse .
" When you retire , you have to have some interests , " says Needham .
" This is my indoor activity .
I did a search online for how to create a website and found lots of good help out there for nothing . "
The Internet , he says , opened up a new world for him .
" I started searching for other sites about bees and met some people from Australia with similar interests .
We 've since become friends , and I went to Australia last year to visit . "
The same thing happened with Gail Bjork , 63 , who runs the Digicamhelp site from her home base near Tampa .
She designed her site but made a friend online in Ireland who has since redesigned it for a more professional sheen .
" My background was art , " says Bjork .
" I was an art teacher .
I did n't know about code .
My friend does .

Oversight Committee to limit RNC e-mail request Michael Roston
Published : Monday June 4 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. Henry Waxman 's House Committee on Oversight and Government reform is close to reaching a deal that would limit the scope of its probe into e-mail accounts maintained by the Republican National Committee and used by White House employees , according to a report in today 's edition of Roll Call .
" Just prior to the Memorial Day recess , ranking member Tom Davis ( R - Va. ) and other committee Republicans urged Waxman to scale back his request for documents from the RNC , " wrote Paul Singer in Monday morning 's paper .
" While the Republicans wrote that Waxmans inquiries into the political use of government resources ' constitute legitimate exercises of the committees oversight authority , ' they argued that the breadth of the committees requests and subpoenas ' far exceed the legitimate needs of the committee . ' "
The exchange between House Democratic and Republican members of the committee was prompted by the briefings of General Services Administration staff by the White House earlier in the year .
Democratic committee members are worried that the White House was seeking to use GSA contracting to assist Republican political campaigns in 2008 .
At issue in particular were " daily tallies of the number of e-mails to and from each RNC account maintained by a White House employee , " which Republican staff insisted would not help the Democratic side of the committee gain more information about the White House 's briefings .
However , a Democratic staffer told Singer that he was optimistic that the limitation on the search would not hurt the probe because " The RNC has since provided data about the account users and the number of messages . "
Noting that the RNC has complied with most committee requests to date , Singer also reported that Republicans were concerned about the cost to the party from cooperating with the probe .
" Several Republican sources put the price tag thus far at ' hundreds of thousands of dollars , ' though none could provide a more specific tally , " Singer reports .

The American economy , fueled by the mortgage market , has soared over the last few years .
What remains to be seen is whether there is a crash , as myself and others are predicting , or a “ soft landing ” , as many economists predict .
Of course , The Economist magazine explains just what those predictions are usually worth :
IN 1929 , days after the stockmarket crash , the Harvard Economic Society reassured its subscribers : “ A severe depression is outside the range of probability ” .
In a survey in March 2001 , 95 % of American economists said there would not be a recession , even though one had already started .
Today , most economists do not forecast a recession in America , but the profession ’s pitiful forecasting record offers little comfort .
Our latest assessment ( see article ) suggests that the United States may well be heading for recession .
So are we on the road to recession *?
A lot of that depends on inflation ( see the postscript at the end of this article ) , which means a lot of it depends on the dollar .
I have contended that a lot of our inflation is being hidden by other countries hoarding dollars as a reserve currency , which acts as a sinkhole where those dollars are removed from the general economy .
It ’s possible , though , that this may be changing :
The enfeebled dollar — lately in sight of $ 1.50 to the euro — would be weaker still without enormous purchases by central banks in emerging economies .
This support is now waning .
China and others are putting a smaller share of increases in reserves into the American currency .
And Asian and Middle Eastern countries with currencies linked to the dollar are facing rising inflation , but falling American interest rates make it harder to tighten their own monetary policy .
They may have to let their currencies rise against the sickly greenback , meaning they will need to buy fewer dollars .
More important , as international investors wake up to the relative weakening of America ’s economic power , they will surely question why they hold the bulk of their wealth in dollars .
The dollar ’s decline already amounts to the biggest default in history , having wiped far more off the value of foreigners ’ assets than any emerging market has ever done .
The vigour of emerging economies is good news for the world economy : for its growth , it has much less need of a strong America .
The bad news for America is that this , in turn , may mean that the world also has less need of the dollar .
Good news for the world …
From the emphasized portion of the excerpt above , our inflationary policies continually devalue the reserves of dollars that other nations hold .
If they can find a reserve with more stable value than the dollar , they might escape from dollar hegemony .
But that ’s bad news for America , as we may have to earn our imports , instead of sending newly - printed bills overseas to obtain them .
* “ Recession ” is defined as two consecutive quarters of contracting GDP .
GDP growth is estimated in relation to inflation , so higher inflation indicates lower GDP growth .
Many analysts ( such as John Williams of Shadowstats.com ) believe that the government systematically underreports inflation .
Thus , by those estimates , we ’ve been in a state of negative GDP growth since about mid-2004 , and thus in a protracted recession .
This week , the subpoenas of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees come due for Harriet Miers and Sara Taylor , respectively .
And it 's been the subject of some speculation that the president 's invocation of " executive privilege " will prevent them from testifying meaningfully .
Though the power of the various subspecies of executive privilege to prevent witnesses -- especially former White House officials -- from testifying is highly questionable , it 's worth noting that the speculation about whether or not they 'll be held in contempt of Congress if they cite the privilege in refusing to answer certain questions ( or even testify at all ) has so far bypassed the question of what , exactly , constitutes contempt in the first place .
But we might not even have to answer that question directly -- if there really is an answer at all .
Instead , ask yourself what happens if these witnesses and others similarly situated come to the committees with the intent of making them actually prove they were in contempt .
Though contempt ( for all its faults , at least under the statutory contempt process ) is the obvious threat here , what if the witnesses simply show up , say words when they 're asked questions , and then deny that they were talking gibberish ?
If they can make fight number one be about whether or not they really were in contempt at all , that just adds another layer to the fights we 're going to have later , such as what power the Congress has to punish that contempt , if contempt it was .
All it ultimately takes to refer a charge of contempt is a majority vote , and Democrats can presumably deliver that .
But if it comes without Republican support ( as it likely would have to ) , and the witnesses have appeared as ordered , are on videotape answering questions as they 're put to them , and deny having been evasive or offering non-answers , what will be the response to the inevitable Republican accusations that the charges are a " partisan witch hunt ? "
Of course , we all know that nothing stops the Republicans from doing that , no matter what happens .
Neither does the use of inherent contempt rather than statutory contempt eliminate that danger .
But be prepared for that possibility .
If the White House wants to run out the clock , there 's little reason for them to do anything differently from their game plan so far .
" I do n't recall " has served them well , and I have a feeling that this invocation of " executive privilege " may turn out to be just a new variation on the same old game .
Do n't be surprised , then , if this week 's " constitutional showdown " ends in yet another flurry of murmuring and head scratching , as the clock continues to run .
But remember , too , that this represents another necessary step in the path the committees have chosen -- that is , to methodically demonstrate the " administration 's " unwillingness to abide by the normal rules of government , and pattern of stonewalling and evasion of oversight .
To what end , we will have to wait to see .

Washington , DC – The Bush Administration may soon have one less tool in its chest to stymie legitimate cases that might expose government misconduct .
Today , Senator Edward Kennedy ( D - MA ) , introduced legislation aimed at narrowing the scope of the state secrets privilege – a huge step towards opening the courthouse doors to people who have suffered real and legitimate harm by the government .
Several important suits , including one involving the extraordinary rendition of a German citizen , Khaled El - Masri , have been successfully blocked by this administration ’s use of the state secrets privilege .
The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office :
" Senator Kennedy has done a great service by introducing this legislation .
For too long , the government has hid behind an overly - broad interpretation of the state secrets privilege to protect itself from the glare of oversight .
The Bush Administration has frequently used the privilege as an alternate form of immunity to block entire cases from going forward .
We all agree that there need to be precautions when it comes to national security , but courts have been competently managing the balance between the security of classified information and the right to a fair trial in criminal cases for years .
Senator Kennedy ’s bill recognizes this fact .
" Abuse of the state secrets privilege is not an abstract concept .
It has a real and human cost .
Khaled El - Masri , Binyam Mohamed , Abou Elkassim Britel , Ahmed Agiza and others have all claimed to have been kidnapped and tortured by our government .
El - Masri was denied his day in court as a result of the administration ’s use of the state secrets privilege .
This bill would ensure the other victims will be allowed their attempts at justice .
" Senator Kennedy ’s bill allows the court to review government national security claims , thus lowering the wall of the current state secrets privilege to just a hurdle .
The current form of the privilege has allowed the administration to successfully hold off investigations into its extraordinary rendition program and its warrantless wiretapping program .
The cloak must be lifted and we urge Congress to waste no time in passing Senator Kennedy ’s bill . "

THE American presidential race in 2008 will be the costliest campaign yet , with the candidates of each of the two main parties getting through $ 500 m each by November .
Add the cash raised by the losing candidates , spending by national committees , political - action groups and the like , and Fortune magazine reckons the total cost could be $ 3 billion .
Campaign - finance reformers bemoan the corrupting influence of such large sums .
But a more sanguine columnist , George Will , points out that Americans spend $ 2 billion on Easter treats .

Want to learn how to create an automated development workflow ?
An automated workflow helps you out with tasks you do when creating websites .
It can help you free up loads of time , and make projects fun again .
The greatest benefit I got from creating a good workflow is the removal of tedious , manual work .
Now , I get to focus on the more fun parts of work like the creative tasks .
I have also experienced a drop in the number of errors , simply because it becomes easier to handle work since Gulp is doing all the error catching for me .
— Klaus Jørgensen , freelance frontend developer Just imagine you managed to free up one hour a day by using an automated workflow .
How would you use this time ?
Would you create more awesome projects , design insanely creative websites , or would you spent it lazing on the couch with the comfort of your family ?
Now , imagine if you could free up one hour a day for everyone in your team .
How much happier would they be ?
How much faster would things get done ?
What would everyone do with the extra time ?
Interested ?
Jump to the packages
So , what ’s an automated workflow ?
An automated workflow is a set of pre-programmed commands .
It aims to help you simplify the tasks you do on a daily basis .
These tasks can be things like :
Updating a file whenever it is changed so you do n’t have to run a command to update it .
Refreshing the browser automatically when needed so you do n’t have to alt - tab and hit the refresh button manually .
Letting you know what errors you made in your code so you do n’t have to spend hours in frustration trying to find out what went wrong .
Letting you write modular code ( even HTML ) so you do n’t have to update that god damned navigation five times whenever something needs to change .
Testing code whenever a developer merges the code to a central repository to make sure that everything works well .
If it ’s does n’t , you ’ll know it before any of your customers does , and you can make the necessary changes before they even know it .
Optimizing your CSS , JavaScript , images and running every optimization you need to make sure your website is wicked fast .
Deploying your website with a single command so you can remove the anxiety from being afraid that you ’ll mess up the deployment process you can in place .
and many more …
There ’s a ton of things you can put together to make a superb workflow !
However , creating such a workflow is difficult .
It ’s especially difficult if you try to do it yourself .
There ’s a staggering amount of information out there .
You have to wade through documentations filled with technical jargons that do n’t seem to make sense .
You may also need to go though tonnes of tutorials that are either for complete beginners , or assume that you can decode long and gnarly JavaScript code .
Furthermore , nobody seems to talk about putting a workflow together .
So you ’re totally on your on when you try to piece bits of information together to make a sense of what ’s really happening .
The worst thing is , even if you manage to get something working , you ’re still be unsure whether you did everything correctly .
There ’s always going to be this nagging feeling that parts of your workflow can be improved .
But you just do n’t know how to go from here .
If you do this alone , you ’d have spent weeks or months getting to a workable solution .
Do you have the luxury to spend so much time crafting your workflow when you have a deadline looming over the weekend ?
I do n’t think so .
So let me help you get there in less than a tenth of the time .
I ’ll show you everything I know about creating a solid workflow .
Here ’s what we ’re going to do in this book .
The web industry evolves much faster than we can keep up .
It ’s normal to feel overwhelmed and confused when faced this jungle of tools .
We ’ll first go all the way to the basics , like learning to use the command line .
Then , I ’ll show you a six - part framework that helps you organize all the tools available to you in this jungle .
You ’ll forever know how does each of these tools play in your workflow .
Finally , we will walk through how to put together an automated workflow , step by step , with simple to understand instructions .
This workflow will do all the things we mentioned above , and many more .
By the end of this book , you would not only have a good workflow to boot , you would also have gained the knowledge to create a workflow for your personalized needs whenever you want to .
You will never again be at the mercy of waiting for someone else to create create a plugin , or a starter kit you desperately need for your projects .
Since only one person needs to know how to make a workflow , your team will ( hopefully ) thank you for making their lives easier .
Every developer I worked with was amazed at just how much easier they can develop with a solid workflow .
The best part ?
You do n’t need to be an expert developer to create an automated workflow .
Although great coding skills and JavaScript knowledge certainly help , they ’re not a prerequisite .
We ’re going to start from the basics of basics and work our way up .
I ’ll guide you through this entire journey , step by step , until you get the hang of it .
So do n’t worry if you do n’t know the command line , or think your coding skills are n’t good enough .
All you need is to be interested in developing your workflow , and be willing to get your hands dirty with code .
" Automating Your Workflow " is a complete collection on how to automate your workflow .
Zell goes through a difficult topic that is often partially explained by other people .
After reading through the book , I found that a lot of the automation is much easier than I expected .
Zell really makes an amazing effort to deliver good content in an engaging and easy to understand manner .
I highly recommend " Automating Your Workflow " because it 'll get you automating your workflow in no time flat !

追記： Alto と言えば Star … と短絡する向きは特 に Mac 関係者に意外と多く、そうした方々がここ を
Star の話であるとの思いこみで読まれるといけないので最初にお断りしておくと、Star と、ここで紹介している Interim Dynabook（すなわち、ハードとしての

404 Blog Not Found : 再び紹介 - Stay Hungry , Stay Foolish 経由で知ったのですが、ジョブズのスタンフォードでの有名なスピーチに字幕が付いたとのこと。これに伴って上のセリフが、より多くの人々の目に触れる機会が増えると思ったので、いやいや、かつて
Mac より遙か以前 に 「 暫定ダイナブック環境」というものが存在したのだよ、ということをアピールする目的とスモールトーク（けっして、言語や開発環境というだけではない…！）の宣伝をかねて便乗(^_^ ; ) 。
くだんのスピーチは全体をとおして示唆に富む良い話なんで、ホントはケチなんかつけたくないんです。でも、暫定ダイナブック（＝アルト＋スモールトーク）のいちファンとしては、どうにもこのセリフだけは聞き捨てなりません。いや。例によってジョブズは必ずしも “ 嘘”は言っていない（たとえば、販売価格など範囲をしぼればたしかにそうですし…）のですけれども、冒頭のセリフを目耳にしたジョブズファンや
Mac ファンの多くは、ほぼ確実に、
マルチフォント機能はジョブズの発案で、その結果、Mac がマルチフォントをシステムレベルで搭載した初めてのコンピュータとして誕生したわけか！
といったふうに誤った見解へ誘導されると思います。（ブクマで指摘があったので念のため。ここで「マルチフォント機能」は単に複数のフォントを使い分けられるというだけの意味ではなく、文字毎に複数のフォント〜プロポーショナルデザインの…を含む〜やサイズ、スタイルを変更でき、かつ、パラグラフ毎の行揃えなどの変更も可能で、文書には絵も挿入できる、見た目の美しい文書をインタラクティブでモードレスな
WYSIWYG 環境で仕上げる機能を、アプリケーションレベルではなく、OS レベル〜俗に言う API レベル〜で提供できている…こと、を象徴的に表わすのに用いています）
たしかに Mac が存在しなければ、他でもない現在主流のスモールトーク的な
GUI やそのルック＆フィール（ここでのマルチフォントを含む…）がここまで世の中に広まることはなかったはずで、そのことにはいちファンとしてとても感謝しています。でも、聴衆が勝手に思いこむのをいいことに、暫定ダイナブックの成果をあたかも自分たちが “ 無”から生み出した手柄であるかのように世に広めてしまうのは、なんだか違うような気がするのです。
Apple には他にももっと誇るべき他社には見られないオリジナリティ（たとえば、ともすれば埋もれてしまいがちな枯れた技術を発掘し、それらを絶妙な取り合わせで、こぎれいにパッケージングして市場に投入する力量とか!?( ^_^ ;) ）があるわけなので、それを胸をはって自慢して欲しいとも思います。
ここではせめて 、
「 パーソナルコンピュータにマルチフォント」というアイデアやその実現が可能であるという確信自体は暫定ダイナブック環境から得たものだが、これから作る
Lisa（ひいては Macintosh）にもそれを取り入れるべきだと私が決断できたのは、大学でカリグラフィーを学んでいたことが大きかった…
というふうにとれるようなことを言ってくれてさえいたら、ととても残念に思います。
念のため触れておくと、マルチフォントについては暫定ダイナブックでは、ジョブズたちが見た
Smalltalk -76 のさらに前身の Smalltalk-72 のころから力を入れていた目玉機能のひとつで、このことはアラン・ケイの有名な論文「パーソナル ダイナミック メディア」の、暫定ダイナブック環境の解説の章（III . An Interim Dynabook）の冒頭で取り上げられていることからも分かります。次に同論文から該当部分の画像を抜粋します。
繰り返しになりますが、これらは Macintosh が発売されるじつに 約10 年前、ジョブズたちが PARC を訪れてデモを見る約５年前の、まだ古い暫定ダイナブック環境のスクリーンショットであることも驚きどころのひとつです。暫定ダイナブック（≒1970 年代のスモールトーク）の資料をひもとくとき、きまって「オーパーツ」という言葉が私の頭をよぎります。
あと、これらの画像だけだとマルチフォントじゃない（フォントが混在してない）じゃん！とケチがついてもいけませんので、念のため、すこし年代は下ってしまいますが（それでも十分
Mac はおろか Lisa よりも前です…） 、1981 年の BYTE 誌に掲載され た Smalltalk - 80 （あるいは Smalltalk - 76。76 と 80 は言語仕様はともかく、その GUI やルック＆フィールについては境界が曖昧です）の、ちゃんとフォントが混在して用いられている画像も載せておきましょう。
ところで、 「 パーソナル ダイナミック メディア 」 といえば、その邦訳を収録した アスキー刊 「 アラン・ケイ 」 が日本では有名ですね。もしかしたら、ひとつ前の一連の画像の存在を今ここで知り、同書には何度も目を通したがこんなのは見たことないぞ！と驚かれた「ダイナブック」通な方々もおられたかもしれません。
実は同書は、原著にはふんだんに含まれているはずの図の多くを（おそらくスペースの都合で）ばっさり捨て去ってしまったうえに、収録されている論文自体も古い暫定ダイナブックの実装（つまり
Smalltalk-72 システムやそこでの実践）についての言及の多くを省いたいくつかある“ショート”
バージョンのひとつなのです。PARC

あとこれは余談＆ほんの言葉遊びにすぎないのですが、この種の「暫定ダイナブックはすごかったんだぞ！」的な情報が出てくると決まって「だが、暫定ダイナブックは製品化されていない」
（Apple はそれを成し遂げたのだから偉い！）ということを捨て台詞に使う人が出てきます。でもこれは、完全にではないにせよ間違った認識です。スモールトークは、たしかにアラン・ケイの手を離れて暫定ダイナブック的な色合いこそ薄められてはいましたが、ちゃんとソフトウエア製品「Smalltalk-80」として販売されているからです。ｗ
まあ、仮に暫定ダイナブック環境が製品化がされていなかった…との判断が成り立ったところで、それをほぼそのまま模倣するのに十分な完成度で存在していたことを示すことができているわけですから、Apple 発と宣伝されて一般にはそう信じられているマルチフォント環境ほかが
Apple やジョブズの発案ではないことを示すには十分…であると、いち暫定ダイナブック厨的には思うわけなのですけれどもね(^_^ ; ) 。
The Blue Brain Project
Scientists rely on computer models to understand the toughest concepts in science : the origin of the universe , the behavior of atoms , and the future climate of the planet .
Now a computer model is being designed to take on the human brain .
Neuroscientist Henry Markram of the Brain Mind Institute at the École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne , Switzerland , has spent the last 15 years painstakingly mapping cells from the living brains of rats so that he can create a neuron - by - neuron simulation of the brain .
With assistance from IBM ( whose nickname , Big Blue , helped name the project ) , Markram hopes to have a virtual human brain , with all its 100 billion neurons , functioning by 2015 .
Scientists still do n’t understand many of the most essential functions of the brain , like memory or the fundamentals of brain disease and treatment .
Markram ’s model will electronically mirror the real brain ’s biological behaviors , imitating mathematically the interactions among individual neurons and the effects of neurotransmitters on those cells .
The model will also be adjustable so that it can explore unusual physiology ( a higher - functioning left hemisphere , say , or a weakened hippocampus ) and environmental changes ( like the effects of taking a pharmaceutical ) .
The data can then be interpreted via computer images .
“ We are building a generic template , ” Markram says , “ which will allow us to reconstruct a brain according to any specifications . ”
To grind through the immense amount of data , IBM has custom - tailored one of its most powerful supercomputers , capable of processing more than 22 trillion operations per second .
With this computer , Markram has created a preliminary model of a neocortical column — a set of about 10,000 cells that work together — equivalent to one in the brain of a 2 - week - old rat .
“ We have achieved the ability to build a brain microcircuit , an elementary unit , and now it ’s just a matter of scaling up , ” he says .
Many of Markram ’s colleagues think that he is too ambitious , that a model of billions of neurons , no matter how intricate , cannot tell much about the functions of a real brain .
“ People think that it is impossible , ” he admits .
“ They believe that we do n’t understand enough about the brain to build it . ”
He counters that mysteries of brain circuitry will be resolved as the project moves forward over the years .
If the Blue Brain team succeeds , scientists will for the first time have a meaningful physical model of the human brain .
So could a fully functioning virtual brain have the ability to create thoughts of its own ?
Markram is n’t counting on it , but he will be watching closely if Blue Brain begins to make its own decisions , providing unique outputs to identical inputs in a way that is beyond chance or chaos theory and achieving something that has never been observed in a computer : consciousness .
“ Once we build the whole brain , ” he says , “ if consciousness emerges , we will be able to study it systematically and understand exactly how it emerges . ”

The Earthtime Project
About 250 million years ago , some disaster wiped out 90 percent of life on Earth , a cataclysm known as the Permian - Triassic extinction .
Around the same time , volcanoes a million times bigger than Mount Saint Helens erupted , spewing enormous clouds of dust and gas into the sky and covering the ground with 2 million square miles of molten lava .
Did the volcanic eruptions cause the extinctions ?
The answer depends on which event occurred first and how long each took — and right now , scientists just do n’t know .
Such is the case with most of the big questions about the history of the Earth , says Paul Renne , director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center : “ Often , our arguments about causality depend on timing . ”
That ’s why he and hundreds of other scientists around the world have joined Earthtime , a 10 - year endeavor to nail down the sequence of past events on Earth by refining scientists ’ techniques for measuring deep time .
The project was started by Sam Bowring , an expert in geologic time at MIT , and Douglas Erwin , a paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History , who conceived of Earthtime during a transcontinental flight together a decade ago .
“ If we really want to understand the history of the Earth , we have to push our dating tools to their limits , ” Bowring says .
Over the past 10 years , such tools have become astonishingly accurate and precise .
Take radioisotope dating , which scientists do by measuring the relative abundance of certain forms of elements ( like potassium - 40 ) called isotopes and then using the known decay rates of those elements to calculate the age of the minerals in which they are found .
In the 1970s , scientists using radioisotope dating could pinpoint the age of a 100 million - year - old rock to within a few million years .
Today Bowring and others have whittled the uncertainty down to less than 100,000 years .
But a few glitches are preventing scientists from making the most of these improvements .
First , separate labs using the same dating techniques employ slightly different materials and methods , leading to different results .
This did n’t matter when measurements of deep time were rough .
Now that the science is more exact , though , small inconsistencies due to experimental error can spark big disagreements .
“ It ’s when we sharpen our tools that these discrepancies turn up more glaringly , ” Renne says .
The problem gets bigger than that , though .
For dating ancient life ( what lived millions , not just thousands , of years ago ) , the radioisotope world includes two camps : those who tell time by uranium and those who use potassium .
There are also entirely different methods for calculating deep time .
Some scientists read the fossil record .
Others study regular astronomical cycles that leave traces in the physical and chemical properties of rocks .
These cycles occur because Earth ’s orbit and orientation to the sun shift , slowly but steadily , causing recurring changes in sunlight and climate patterns .
Yet rarely does anyone check whether dates derived from these different techniques agree .
It ’s as if every scientist is reading from his or her own watch , but nobody ’s watch is synchronized with anyone else’s .
Earthtime ’s goal is to synchronize the numerous watches worn by scientists who study deep time , then use them to create one superaccurate chronology of Earth ’s past .
To do this , Bowring and his colleagues have distributed a set of reference materials called standards ( rock samples with known ages ) and tracers ( small quantities of isotopes with a known composition ) to help make different labs ’ results consistent .
Until now , labs have used varying standards and tracers , which has led to differing results .
Bowring hopes to eliminate such problems by giving everyone the same starting point .
Bowring and his fellow keepers of deep time are also searching for rock beds where scientists can test how well dates derived by different methods agree .
And they are looking for new samples of ancient material to fill in details about ancient events .
For instance , next year the ship JOIDES Resolution is scheduled to drill into the floor of the Pacific Ocean to extract rock cores that will span the period from about 53 million to 18 million years ago , a time of vast climate change .
If it works , Earthtime should enable scientists to study new , previously unappreciated aspects of Earth ’s past .
Erwin compares the endeavor to the Human Genome Project , in which scientists mapped the sequence of our genes .
“ The fundamental goal of the Human Genome Project was n’t the genome itself — it was figuring out what our genes do , ” Erwin says .
“ Our goal is to produce a better timescale so we can go out and start asking a whole new set of questions . ” — Erika Check Hayden
Planted Forests Project
On the Southeast Asian island of Borneo , loggers , conservation biologists , and indigenous groups are coming together to test a new model of land use that gives everyone a piece of the pie .
If their plan succeeds , it could be replicated in tropical regions around the world , protecting biological diversity while allowing the local people to enjoy the economic benefits of productive land .
The Sarawak state government in Malaysia commissioned the Planted Forests Project in an attempt to have it all : economic development , wildlife protection , and land use by local people .
Nearly 1,900 square miles have been allocated for the planted forests zone .
Slightly less than half the land is earmarked for the logging of acacia trees — a fast - growing species that can be harvested for paper .
More than 30 percent of the land will be set aside for conservation .
Indigenous people will continue to live on the remainder .
Biologist Robert Stuebing , who set up the conservation department of Grand Perfect ( the government ’s timber contractor ) , says the project was inspired by a map of the region showing where the government planned to plant acacia .
Some areas would be used for the logging plantations , while others would be left alone .
Stuebing realized that the network of undisturbed patches could serve as a haven for native plant and animal life .
“ Even if less than the whole habitat is protected , ” he explains , “ as long as you have enough bits and pieces and these are connected , you might be able to maintain a good sample of biodiversity . ”
Working with the loggers and the state forest department , he created corridors of land linking the forest conservation areas so wildlife can travel among them .
Other conservation and development projects are also using protected passageways as a way to save native species .
The question for all these initiatives is whether the corridors will actually allow enough movement to preserve populations of wildlife .
Stuebing ’s first priority was to begin an inventory of what was living in the forest zone .
Researchers have counted bearded pigs , deer , small mammals , birds , frogs , fish , and dragonflies and are now in the process of surveying fungi .
The department keeps a log of every species identified , where it was sighted , whether it is endemic ( exclusive to the region ) , and what its international and local protection status is .
Despite previous logging and farming in the planted forests zone , more than 400 vertebrate species , including bears , civets , macaques , leopard cats , mongooses , pangolins , and porcupines , have been spotted there .
Researchers have even discovered 18 snails that have never been seen anywhere else on Earth .
“ The beauty of the project was to see that there was such resilience and survivability of the fauna , ” Stuebing says .
How the giant new acacia plantations will affect this diversity remains uncertain .
Some carnivores , frogs , and squirrels seem to have taken to the planted areas more quickly than birds , bats , and snakes .
With a considerable financial stake in the logging project , the government is unlikely to give up on the acacia stands , even if monitoring shows that they are harming biodiversity .
But in a part of the world where human livelihood depends on the forest , this experiment at integrating wildlife protection into the mix is a big step in the right direction , Stuebing says : “ It looks sustainable , and biologically , I really think this model will work well . ”
If he ’s right , sustainable developers around the world may copy his strategy as they struggle to balance the needs of humans and wildlife .

Dark - Matter Experiment
For 75 years , scientists have vainly searched for particles of dark matter , the invisible substance believed to pervade deep space and to glue galaxies together .
Next year , in a vat of chilled liquid buried deep in a cave in central Italy , the universe may finally be ready to give up this great secret .
An international team of physicists is preparing XENON100 , a simple experiment with a huge ambition : to record the moment when a bit of dark matter — known as a weakly interacting massive particle , or WIMP — smacks into the nucleus of an atom of liquid xenon , triggering a flash of light and an electric charge .
“ We definitely have a chance to see these events , ” says Columbia University physicist and XENON team leader Elena Aprile .
According to the latest theories and observations , the universe has about six times as much dark matter as the atomic matter that makes up our ordinary world .
But even though uncounted billions of dark - matter particles pass through Earth ( and right through you , in fact ) every second , they can not be seen ; they have no electric charge and interact so infrequently with atomic matter that the only way we can hope to find them is by laying a clever trap .
Currently there are about 10 teams of scientists devising experiments to discern the elusive moment when a stray WIMP nudges an atom of ordinary matter , but the latest version of XENON will be by far the most sensitive .
All the experiments are lodged far below Earth ’s surface to shield the detectors from background radiation .
The Italian Gran Sasso National Laboratory is located nearly 4,600 feet beneath the top of a mountain , in caverns off a highway tunnel .
XENON100 is a scaled - up version of XENON10 , one of Aprile ’s earlier dark - matter experiments .
It uses liquid xenon , an inert gas at room temperature , to catch WIMPs .
The detector is a stainless - steel cylinder surrounded by a protective “ castle ” made of two kinds of lead and a layer of polyethylene to screen out residual background interference .
Inside , 330 pounds of xenon will be chilled to – 140 degrees Fahrenheit .
Xenon ’s attractive property is that it gives off a brief flash of light if a WIMP bumps into the nucleus of one of its atoms .
A set of sensors on the cylinder bottom records this signal , while sensors on top detect the minuscule release of electrons liberated by the WIMP .
By reading the two signals and measuring the time interval between them , researchers can fix the point of impact within the cylinder in three dimensions .
Dark matter is not necessarily composed of WIMPs — theorists have identified a host of other possible dark - matter particles — but they are the leading candidates because their presence would close a loophole in the reigning theory of particle physics , called the standard model .
To address this discrepancy , scientists have proposed that all particles have large - mass counterparts , or superpartners .
The neutralino , even with a mass at least 50 times that of a proton , would be the lightest of these .
It is a prime WIMP candidate .
If XENON100 uncovers the long - rumored neutralino , it will mark another huge step in science ’s grand humbling of humanity .
“ Copernicus discovered we ’re not the center of the universe , ” says Yale physicist Daniel McKinsey , a member of the XENON10 team .
“ If we find dark matter , we will discover that we are not even made of the stuff that composes most of the universe . ”

The Census of Marine Life
What lives in the ocean ?
In 2000 , this deceptively simple question spawned a $ 650 million study to catalog all sea life : plants , animals , bacteria , and fungi .
“ We simply had no concept of the diversity of life in the ocean , ” says Rutgers University biologist Fred Grassle , who chairs the Census of Marine Life ’s scientific steering committee .
“ Whether it was coral reefs , the deep seafloor , or even what lives in people ’s backyards along the shore — so little was known . ”
By helping researchers identify threatened species and habitats , the census will allow better protection of the ocean ’s resources .
Newly discovered creatures could also provide a gold mine of natural chemical compounds useful as pharmaceuticals or for industrial applications .

It takes time to cover something as large as the world ’s oceans , so the 2,000 - plus census takers from more than 80 countries have broken up their assignment into 17 more manageable subgroups — like coral reefs , continental shelves , and mid-ocean ridges — that should provide a good overview of what ’s out there .
Teams of marine scientists are towing nets to scoop up plankton , tagging large predators to track their migrations , sequencing the DNA in seawater to hunt for microbes , and trawling the seafloor for bottom dwellers .
The scale and scope of the Census of Marine Life go beyond any previous biological survey , but 7 years into the 10 - year initiative , Grassle reports that work is progressing on schedule .
About 5,300 previously unknown organisms have already been identified , and every new sighting is logged into the census ’s freely accessible Ocean Biogeographic Information System ( www.iobis.org), which boasts more than 13 million observations of 80,000 species .
Scientists have been bowled over by the diversity that has turned up in unexpected places , from crustaceans and worms on the deep seafloor to carnivorous sponges in the Antarctic Ocean .
The long - term challenge , says marine ecologist Paul Snelgrove of Memorial University of Newfoundland , will be to continue investigating the ecological significance of the newfound organisms after the primary census is completed in 2010 .
“ The first 10 years have been very much focused on discovery , ” he says .
“ The next step is to ask , what do these species do and how important are they to the way the earth works ? ” — Jennifer Barone
Artificial Life
In the mid-1990s , Craig Venter rose to fame by claiming that he and his colleagues would decipher the human genome long before a huge team of government scientists would .
He at least managed a tie : Both groups have provided increasingly accurate versions of the genome since 2000 , and Venter has just published the first genome sequence from one person ( himself ) that includes all the chromosomes inherited from his parents .
As important as sequencing the human genome has been , however , Venter is overseeing another experiment that could someday eclipse it .
Scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute and Venter ’s biotech firm , Synthetic Genomics , are trying to make a genome from scratch .
“ I plan to show that we understand the software of life by creating artificial life , ” Venter declares in his new memoir , A Life Decoded .
Venter first announced this plan in 2002 , and he has been doggedly pursuing it ever since .
Step one of the plan : Identify the fewest number of genes a microbe needs to survive in a lab .
The scientists would then synthesize that minimal genome from raw ingredients and insert it into a host cell .
The genome would make its own proteins and gradually transform the cell into a new creature .
To build the minimal genome , Venter turned to a microbe he and his colleagues had already been studying for several years , a pathogen known as Mycoplasma genitalium that causes urinary tract infections .
He and his colleagues had determined that the parasitic microbe has just 482 genes ( 18,000 reside in a human ) .
They then began testing each of those genes to see which were essential to the microbe ’s survival .
Last year , they reported that M. genitalium can survive without 100 of its genes .
“ We know which genes we can eliminate one at a time , but we do n’t know which we can eliminate together , ” Venter says .
To see if the remaining 382 genes meet the minimum requirement for life , Venter ’s team will have to build a genome with them and drop it into a cell .
Venter knew that no one had ever successfully transplanted a bacterial genome , and there were a lot of reasons to suspect it might not work .
“ Cells in general do n’t like another cell ’s DNA injected into them , ” he says .
But this June , he and his colleagues delicately teased out the entire genome of Mycoplasma mycoides ( which infects goats ) and slipped it into Mycoplasma capricolum , a related but distinctly separate species .
Tests revealed that the recipient bacteria lost their old genomes , while the donor genomes began to take over .
“ It ’s the key breakthrough in this field , ” Venter says .
Now Venter ’s team is creating a minimal genome themselves and transplanting it into a cell .
Until recently , scientists have been able to synthesize only relatively small pieces of DNA , and they ’ve had a difficult time ensuring that the actual molecule turns out to have the sequence it ’s supposed to .
A number of groups of scientists are developing new methods to create accurate chunks of DNA .
Venter ’s team is one of them .
They ’re borrowing a DNA - building enzyme produced by a virus that does a good job of gluing together genetic building blocks .
In 2003 , they reported that they had synthesized the 5,386 “ letters ” in the DNA of a virus that infects bacteria .
When they inserted the DNA into a microbe , it produced new viruses .
Today the scientists are figuring out how to cement dozens of those 5,000 - letter - size chunks into a single piece of DNA big enough to hold an entire Mycoplasma genome .
Venter hopes to have the first synthetic species within the next few months .
In contrast to the images from Frankenstein movies , the man -made creature would barely eke out an existence in the pampered confines of a laboratory flask .
But Venter sees its creation as the foundation for a new kind of genetic engineering .
Today scientists engineer microbes either by adding a few extra genes or fine - tuning the genes they already have , tinkering on top of nature ’s templates .
Venter regards a minimal genome as an opportunity to build life from the ground up , like an engineer assembling a new piece of technology .
Venter does n’t plan on designing those genes from scratch , however .
He and his colleagues have been trawling the world ’s oceans for microbes and sequencing their genes .
Last April , they announced that they had raised the total number of known genes from 4 million to 10 million .
His colleagues are still out at sea , still finding new genes .
“ By next April , we will have doubled the number again — that ’s my hope , ” Venter says .
Along with the ocean , Venter is also searching for microbes in the air and deep underground .
BP has joined in a partnership with Synthetic Genomics to sequence genomes from microbes that live in coal mines and oil wells .
From this vast collection of genes , Venter hopes to build microbes that can produce hydrogen gas or be an efficient source of solar energy .
Some microbes could clean up dangerous pollution or fight global warming .
To handle the staggering task of testing all of the potential combinations of genes , Venter and his colleagues are going to set up an army of robots to build a million synthetic organisms a day .
Other scientists ( including Jay Keasling , last year ’s DISCOVER Scientist of the Year ) are having great success adding handfuls of genes to E. coli and other microbes to make a variety of valuable products , including medicines and jet fuel .
But no one is running Venter ’s kind of experiment .
No one else can .
It requires years of expensive grunt work and offers no guarantee of success .
It is hard to imagine a conventional academic researcher finding enough long - term funds to conduct such an experiment .
It is impossible to imagine impatient stockholders allowing a biotech company to do so .
Venter has the rare privilege of running his own institute and company , with a staff of hundreds ( and that ’s not counting all his robots ) .
People may eventually look back on Venter ’s experiment with artificial life the way we look back from our laptops to the days when computers filled entire floors of buildings .
Rob Carlson , a biotech expert at the University of Washington , points out that the science behind Venter ’s work is getting cheaper and more powerful year by year .
“ You wo n’t require a university ; you wo n’t require the National Science Foundation , ” Carlson says .
“ You can do it in your garage if you want . ”
Out of a million garages , a million new species may bloom .

New government - transparency database will decrease available info about intel agencies
A new online government spending database -- designed to increase transparency as to how taxpayer dollars are spent -- will actually allow intelligence agencies to keep more secrets about their private contracts than before .
" [ W ] hen it comes to intelligence spending , there will actually be a net loss of public information because categories of intelligence contracting data that were previously disclosed will now be withheld , " reports Steven Aftergood at Secrecy News .
The database , USAspending.gov , launched earlier this month to show taxpayers how government money is distributed to private companies and which lawmakers and congressional districts receive the most lucrative contracts .
It was never designed to disclose classified information , but as Aftergood and Daniel G. Dupont at InsideDefense report , even unclassified spending of intelligence agencies is being kept from public view .
The Defense Intelligence Agency , National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency and Counterintelligence Field Activity argued that including their unclassified contracts in the database would open a vulnerability in operational secrity , Aftergood reports .
" I appreciate your concerns that reporting these actions to the publicly accessible website could provide unacceptable risk of insight to your individual missions and budgets , " wrote Shay D. Assad , director of defense procurement & acquisition policy for the Undersecretary of Defense , in a letter posted by Secrecy News .
" " As such , I concur with your waiver requests to not report your unclassified actions to FPDS - NG [ Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation , aka USASpending.gov ] at this time . "
The data waiver is not retroactive , so contracts with the intelligence agencies before FY2007 are still available .
These include contracts , according to Aftergood , " ranging in amounts from tens of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars . "
School Cancels Lunches Due To Oil Price Increase
People all over the world have been hit with the rising prise of oil .
Some decide to drive less while others carpool more .
A select few take more extreme measures , like a Yokohama Elementary school who decided to cancel lunches .
The Yokohama city education board announced that Ekoda Elementary School would cancel lunch and classes on two days in January as higher oil prices led to food cost increases .
Meal costs for the school up to October already surpassed initial estimates by nearly 10 % .
The schools prepare their own lunches and receive about $ 35.00 a month from the students and the schools cannot increase the charge .
This will be the first recorded incident where a school is going to be closed due to rising oil prices and a government official is quoted as calling it “ unusual nationwide ” .

Hi Jim ,
Thank you for this further information .
Neurosurgeons also talk of an aspartame ring .
Wish someone would take a picture of it .
Here is the Trocho study that shows the formaldehyde converted from the free methyl alcohol embalms living tissue and destroys DNA .
http://www.mpwhi.com/formaldehyde_from_aspartame.pdf
I will always believe this is one of the worst plagues in world history because as you said it can damage DNA for generations to come .
It 's definitely hard to know which metabolite is the worst since every component of aspartame is poisonous ( aspartic acid , an excitotoxin , methanol , a neurotoxin , phenylalanine as an isolate a neurotoxin , DKP , a brain tumor agent ) .
Thank you for your extremely well expressed further information .
Dr. Betty Martini , D.Hum , Founder Mission Possible International 9270 River Club Parkway Duluth , Georgia 30097 770 242-2599 www.mpwhi.com, www.dorway.com and www.wnho.net Aspartame Toxicity Center , www.holisticmed.com/aspartame Aspartame Information List , www.mpwhi.com
Resources : Aspartame Disease : An Ignored Epidemic , www.sunsentpress.com by H. J. Roberts , M.D. Excitotoxins : The Taste That Kills , www.russellblaylockmd.com by Russell Blaylock , M.D. , neurosurgeon Aspartame Documentary : Sweet Misery : A Poisoned World , www.soundandfury.tv
From Dr. James Bowen , MD aspartamehelp@juno.com 12-29-7 Dear Dr Martini , Referring to Dr Woodrow C Monte 's article about methanol neural degenerations as " seminal " was very well put , because with an Eminent Scientist like himself drawing a partial background to build upon I can go on to mention several ways in which Aspartame is far worse than methanol .
The Di Keto Piperazine ring isomer of Aspartame , consisting of that entire Aspartame molecule wrapped around upon itself and doubly bonded to itself , is a far more potent and farther reaching polymerizer of proteins , than formaldehyde .
As a matter of note : Many plastics chemical substrates are also Diketopiperazines , because of their extreme polymer reactivity .
Surgeons operating upon Aspartame brain tumors often note a WHITE PLASTIC being formed throughout those Aspartame afflicted brains !
The next metabolic step in that methyl alcohol toxicity is that formaldehyde when formed in the human , is then very rapidly oxidized , metabolized into formic acid , Fire Ant Poison :
Which can be such a potent poisoning that a single fire ant can sometimes kill a human weighing millions of times more than itself .
This entire chain methanol of poisonings occurs 75 % within the mitochondria , which usually are about only 1 % of cellular volume .
This formic acid , then shatters mitochondria , killing that cell and diffuses on into many more cells , until it has created a blister of dead tissue :
Why it is called then called a blister poison !
From an Autoimmunity standpoint , your macrophages ( Captains of Immune responses ) then are stimulated by all of these : polymerized neural tissues , ( some further denatured with Di Keto Piperazine , ) and various fragments of now denatured human nervous system tissues of every type .
Because dicarboxylic acid neural excito toxins ( from Aspartame , including its diketopiperazine ) do not cross the blood brain barrier , but rather , are secreted into the ventricles by the choroid plexus , many of those areas mentioned by Dr Monte are the ones extremely afflicted by these Aspartame neural degenerations , to produce symptoms and disabilities from those specific areas arising , before plasticizing of the entire brain becomes specifically noticed , because diffuse plasticizing causes diffuse mental disabilities , while those structures mentioned by Dr Monte cause well defined syndromes and symptoms , beyond mental degenerations .
Sincerely , Dr Jim Bowen

OMAHA , Nebraska ( Reuters ) - A 19 - year - old school dropout who shot and killed eight people and himself at a Nebraska shopping mall smuggled a stolen assault rifle into the building wrapped in a sweatshirt and opened fire without warning when he got out of a third - floor elevator , police said on Thursday .
Robert Hawkins left text and voice messages with friends and family before Wednesday ’s bloodbath .
“ He had apparently been experiencing some mental health problems , ideations of suicide , ” Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren told a briefing .
His victims ranged in age from 24 to 66 .
They included two male customers and another man and four women who were employees of the Von Maur department store where most of the carnage occurred .
Warren said Hawkins fired more than 30 rounds from the assault weapon .
“ It appears that the shooting victims were randomly selected ” with little if any words exchanged between the shooter and his victims , the chief said .
He killed one mall customer by shooting from the third to the second floor of an atrium but the rest of the victims were mostly store employees in a customer service area .
Four other people were wounded , two of whom remain in critical condition , Warren said .
A fifth person suffered a medical problem during the incident and was taken away for treatment .
Warren said a review of security tapes and interviews revealed that unarmed mall police were aware that Hawkins had entered the Von Maur store on the second floor of the Westroads Mall .
He quickly took an elevator to the third floor and began firing when the elevator door opened , he said .
Warren said the tapes seem to show that Hawkins had the gun wrapped in a hooded sweatshirt .
He said the gun was stolen from the boy ’s stepfather .
Investigators had not determined if the weapon ’s owner had acquired it legally , he said .
The Omaha World - Herald reported in Thursday ’s editions that Hawkins had recently lost both his job and his girlfriend and felt worthless .
“ I ’m a piece of shit , ” said a suicide note he left behind “ but I ’m going to be famous now , ” the newspaper said .
Hawkins had been living since last year with the family of a teenage friend who ’s mother said Hawkins had shown her family the rifle the night before the shootings .
She thought it was too old to be functional .
The newspaper reported that Hawkins ’s parents divorced when he was 3 and he had spent time in foster care .
He had also broken up with a girlfriend recently and was fired from a fast food restaurant after being accused of stealing $ 17 .
The friend ’s mother said he appeared to be trying to turn his life around .
When she heard about the mall shooting , she told the newspaper , “ I thought ‘ Oh , my God , I hope this is not Robbie . ”
It was then she found the note he had left , which included a will .

“ Our entire state is grieving , ” said Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman .
Local media said it was the worst single day of violence in the state ’s history .
It was the latest in a series of mass killings that have shocked the United States , where gun ownership is widespread and the right to possess arms is a fiercely contested constitutional issue currently on the agenda of the Supreme Court .
The White House said it was a “ terrible tragedy . ”
This is the best introductory , conceptual article on Lisp I ’ve ever seen .
It ’s written by Slava Akhmechet .
Lispers have long felt that it ’s very difficult to get lay programmers to understand Lisp , because there ’s no common context to help people relate to its unique syntax and powerful features .
Slava went against the grain and managed to pull it off .
His message is “ XML = Lisp with angle brackets ” .
Or , put another way , “ You ’re soaking in it ! ”
Are you using Ant ?
Are you using Hibernate and / or Spring ?
Are you using CodeSmith to generate code ?
If so , then you are already halfway to understanding Lisp , because even though the syntax is different , the underlying concepts are the same .
XML is your code , and the XML processors are analogous to a Lisp interpreter running your code against some pre-loaded libraries .
The difference is Lisp gives you more flexibility and control ( ie. more power ) .
If you do n’t understand Lisp macros , but you know how to program in C / C++ , he helps you make the transition from C/ C++ macros to Lisp macros .
He sums it up with : “ Lisp is executable XML with a friendlier syntax . ”
Once you understand these analogies , he introduces you to Lisp code .
If Lisp has mystified you , this is a great introduction that will help you get on your way .
It wo n’t make you totally comfortable with it right off the bat , but it will help you get over the initial comprehension barrier .
To increase your comprehension , and to learn what Lisp can really do , the following books have come highly recommended to me .
I must admit I have n’t read them yet : On Lisp ( online book ) , by Paul Graham ; and Practical Common Lisp ( online book ) , by Peter Seibel .
Some others that cover Scheme , a Lisp dialect : The Little Schemer , by Daniel Friedman ; and Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ( aka . “ SICP ” , online book ) , by Harold Abelson , Gerald Sussman , and Julie Sussman .
WARNING : This list contains sounds which may offend some listeners ]
I have struggled long and hard over a second list of incredible recordings , but I have finally managed to find 10 that I think are worthy of being here .
If you are new to the site you might want to hear some of the original recordings – you can find them on the Top 10 Incredible Recordings list .
10 . Alessandro Moreschi The Last Castrato
The recording of Moreschi was extremely popular on the original list , so I have found a second song by him .
In this recording of Domine Salvum Fac , we hear the typical “ sobbing ” style from the time .
Here we also have Moreschi backed by a choir and singing some of his finer high notes recorded .
Moreschi was the last recorded castrato ( a man who had had his testicles removed as a child , to prevent his voice from breaking as he grew older ) .
We have his recordings thanks to the foresight of Pope Leo XIII , who had an interest in the “ modern ” recording devices being invented at the time .
You can read more about Moreschi , and Castrati in general , at the Cogitz article Castrati : Castrated for the Love of Music .

1. Adolf Hitler Threatens Jewish Extermination
There have been some debates in comments from certain people who deny the Holocaust truly happened .
Despite showing images which give evidence that it did , some still do n’t believe it .
This recording is a very important one because it is the recording in which Hitler clearly states that if they go to war , the Jews of Europe will be exterminated .
This is a translation of what he is saying :
And one more thing I would like now to state , on this day memorable , perhaps , not only for us Germans .
I have often been a prophet in my life and was generally laughed at .
During my struggle for power , the Jews primarily received with laughter my prophecies that I would someday assume the leadership of the state and thereby of the entire nation and then , among many other things , achieve a solution of the Jewish problem .
I suppose that meanwhile the laughter of Jewry in Germany that resounded then is probably already choking in their throats .
[ applause ; Hitler coughs ]
Today I want to be a prophet again .
If international finance Jewry within Europe and abroad should succeed once more in plunging the peoples into a world war , then the consequence will be not the Bolshevization of the world and therewith a victory of Jewry , but on the contrary , the destruction of the Jewish race in Europe . [ applause ]
The recording was made on January 30 , 1939 , the sixth anniversary of Hitler ’s rise to power .

Bush calls for end to ' 67 Israeli occupation David Edwards
Published : Thursday January 10 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This President Bush , summing up meetings with both sides in the Israeli - Palestinian dispute , said Thursday that a peace accord will require " painful political concessions " by each .
Resolving the status of Jerusalem will be hard , he said , and he called for the end of the " occupation " of Arab land by the Israeli military .
" There should be an end to the occupation that began in 1967 , " Bush told reporters in Jerusalem , as reported by CNN .
" The agreement must establish a Palestine as a homeland for the Palestinian people , just as Israel is a homeland for the Jewish people . "
Bush also called on Palestinians to confront terrorists and dismantle " terrorist infrastructure . "
" Security is fundamental , " Bush said .
" No agreement and no Palestinian state will be born of terror . "
Bush also appealed for " Arab countries to reach out to Israel . "
" Now is the time to make difficult choices , " Bush said after a first - ever visit to the Palestinian territories , which followed separate meetings with Israeli leaders in Jerusalem the day before .
Bush is in the Mideast for eight days , trying to bolster his goal of achieving a long - elusive peace agreement by the end of his presidency in a year .
Speaking at his hotel in Jerusalem , he said again that he thinks that is possible .
" I am committed to doing all I can to achieve it , " Bush said .
Within minutes , Bush 's national security adviser Stephen Hadley said the president would return to the Middle East " at least once and maybe more " over the next year .
He would n't elaborate on possible destinations , but another White House official said Bush is likely to return for Israel 's 60th anniversary celebrations in May .
Bush gave his most detailed summation yet of what a final peace should include , including U.S. expectations for the resolution of some of the hardest issues in the violent conflict , one of the world 's longest - running and most intractable .
He used tough language intended to put both sides on notice that he sees no reason they cannot get down to serious business , " starting right now . "
In his set of U.S. bottom lines were security for Israel , a " contiguous " state for the Palestinians and the expectation that final borders will be negotiated to accommodate territorial changes since Israel 's formation 60 years ago .
He made a point of using a loaded term  occupation  to describe Israeli control over land that would eventually form the bulk of an independent Palestinian state .
That he did so in Jerusalem underscored that he is trying not to seem partial to Israel .
On borders , Bush said " any agreement will require adjustments " to the lines drawn for Israel in the late 1940s .
He was referring to Israeli neighborhoods on disputed lands that Israel would keep when an independent Palestinian state is formed .
At the same time , Bush reiterated that Palestinians deserve better than a " Swiss cheese " state , and that a state would n't be viable otherwise .
" The point of departure for permanent status negotiations to realize this vision seems clear , " he said .
" There should be an end to the occupation that began in 1967 .
The agreement must establish a Palestine as a homeland for the Palestinian people just as Israel is a homeland for the Jewish people . "
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Bush was referring to the West Bank when he spoke of occupation .
Bush offered no specifics to resolve the fate of disputed Jerusalem , but urged both sides to work toward a solution in what he said could be the most difficult issue to settle in a long list of them .
" I know Jerusalem is a tough issue , " Bush said .
" Both sides have deeply felt political and religious concerns . "
" It is vital that each side understands that satisfying the other 's fundamental objectives is key to a successful agreement , " the president said .
" Security for Israel and viability for the Palestinian state are in the mutual interests of both parties . "
Hadley said that Bush was n't announcing new U.S. policy with any of his statements , but was trying to reiterate the American position all in one place .
" The important thing ... is what he 's beginning to hear from the Palestinian and the Israeli side , " he said .
Bush spent most of his day in the Palestinian West Bank , seeking to counter Palestinians ' skepticism about his commitment to Mideast peace .
He undercut that message somewhat by saying it may not be possible to resolve this year the current , violent split in Palestinian leadership  vital to a deal establishing an independent state .
The militant group Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in June , meaning the Palestinian people  and the land that could eventually form an independent Palestine  are split between governance by Hamas there and by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ' Fatah - led government in the West Bank .
The president is not stopping in Gaza .
Bush had harsh criticism for Hamas , which does not recognize Israel 's right to exist .
Hamas , he said , was elected to help improve the lot of Palestinians , but " has delivered nothing but misery . "
" The question is whether or not hard issues can be resolved and the vision emerges , so that the choice is clear amongst the Palestinians , " Bush said at Abbas ' side at his government 's headquarters in Ramallah .
" The choice being , ` Do you want this state ?
Or do you want the status quo ?
Do you want a future based upon a democratic state ?
Or do you want the same old stuff ? " '
" We want a state , of course , " Abbas said in English .
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri called Bush 's comments a " declaration of war . "
" Bush 's visit and remarks today have indicated that his visit came to support the occupation and has brought nothing to the Palestinian people but evil , " the Hamas spokesman said .
Bush 's West Bank visit has generated little excitement among Palestinians , who doubt his promises to try to move along Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
Bush has kept Mideast peace at arm 's length until now , and the U.S. is perceived in the Palestinian areas in any case as a staunch ally of Israel , at the expense of the Palestinians .
Abbas , however , said Bush 's visit " gives our people great hope . "
The Palestinian leader called on Israel to fulfill its commitments under a 2003 U.S. - backed Mideast peace plan .
The plan , known as the roadmap , calls on Israel to halt settlement activity in the West Bank , while requiring the Palestinians to dismantle militant groups .
Neither side has fully carried out its obligations .
Bush has named Lt. Gen. William Fraser III , assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , to monitor steps that both sides are making on the peace process , a U.S. official told The Associated Press .
That , too , met with approval by Palestinian officials .
" It 's one of the positive signs of the visit , " said Mohammed Mustafa , economic adviser to Abbas .
With his presidency over a year from now , Bush said he knows " I 've got 12 months . "
Bush said Israel needs to help Palestinians modernize their security forces , and jabbed Israel for security polices that could carve up Palestinian territory into unworkable or ungovernable chunks .
" Swiss cheese is n't going to work when it comes to the outline of a state , " Bush said .
In Jerusalem , Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said his government shares the belief that the " current status quo is far from desirable . "
The president also said that he understands Palestinian frustrations over checkpoints throughout the West Bank but says they 're necessary for now to give Israelis a sense of security .
Bush 's sympathy about the daily hassle checkpoints pose for Palestinians trying to move around the West Bank followed an unexpected firsthand view of them .
Fog demanded that Bush be driven from Jerusalem to Ramallah , instead of going by helicopter .
On his drive , Bush passed through a security checkpoint , and within sight of the concrete walls of Israel 's West Bank separation barrier , which Palestinians views as an illegal land grab .
After the new conference with Abbas , Bush flew to Bethlehem .
Along the way , signs in English proclaimed " Occupation is terrorism " and commanded the United States to " stop giving aid to occupation and death to our children . "
The president toured the Church of the Nativity and toured the grotto , or cave , beneath which many believe is the birthplace of Christ .
Outside , he thanked some monks and again lamented the many restrictions on Palestinian life in Bethlehem .

A QUESTION OF FAITH A QUESTION OF FAITH A new survey of U.S. adults who do n't go to church , even on holidays , finds 72 % say " God , a higher or supreme being , actually exists . "
But just as many ( 72 % ) also say the church is " full of hypocrites . "
Indeed , 44 % agree with the statement " Christians get on my nerves . "
LifeWay Research , the research arm of the Southern Baptist Convention , based in Nashville , conducted the survey of 1,402 " unchurched " adults last spring and summer .
The margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points .
THE IDEA CLUB :
Where do you turn for spiritual or religious community ?
The survey defines " unchurched " as people who had not attended a religious service in a church , synagogue or mosque at any time in the past six months .
More than one in five ( 22 % ) of Americans say they never go to church , the highest ever recorded by the General Social Survey , conducted every two years by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago .
In 2004 , the percentage was 17 % .
Many of the unchurched are shaky on Christian basics , says LifeWay Research director Ed Stetzer .
Just 52 % agree on the essential Christian belief that " Jesus died and came back to life . "
And 61 % say the God of the Bible is " no different from the gods or spiritual beings depicted by world religions such as Islam , Hinduism , Buddhism , etc. , " although Buddhist philosophy has no god and Hindus worship many .
Belief in ' a generic god '
Non-churchgoers " lean to a generic god that fits into every imaginable religious system , even when ( systems ) contradict one another , " Stetzer says .
" If you went back 100 years in North America , there would have been a consensus that God is the God in the Bible .
We can't assume this any longer .
" We no longer have a home - field advantage as Christians in this culture . "
Most of the unchurched ( 86 % ) say they believe they can have a " good relationship with God without belonging to a church . "
And 79 % say " Christianity today is more about organized religion than loving God and loving people . "
" These outsiders are making a clear comment that churches are not getting through on the two greatest commandments , " to love God and love your neighbor , says Scott McConnell , associate director of LifeWay Research .
" When they look at churches … they do n't see people living out the faith . "
But despite respondents ' critical views of organized religion , Stetzer is optimistic .
He cites the finding that 78 % would " be willing to listen " to someone tell " what he or she believed about Christianity . "
They already know believers — 89 % of the unchurched have at least one close friend who is Christian , Stetzer noted .
And 71 % agreed that " believing in Jesus makes a positive difference in a person 's life . "
" What surprised me is the openness of the hard - core unchurched to the message of God and Christianity — just not as expressed in church , " Stetzer says .
" It 's a personal thing , not an institutional thing .
It 's a matter of starting conversations . "
The direct approach Still , most of Christian belief has seeped into popular culture outside church walls and denominational tethers , says Philip Goff , a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture at Indiana University in Indianapolis .
New forms of community , such as Internet Bible study and prayer circles , also mean some people do n't believe they need a church , Goff says .
" Is there a workshop for churches in being less annoying , less hypocritical ? " asks Arthur Farnsley , administrator for the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion and a fellow at Goff 's center .
" So much of American religion today is therapeutic in approach , focused on things you want to fix in your life , " he says .
" The one - to - one approach is more attractive .
People do n't go to institutions to fix their problems .
" Most people have already heard the basic Christian message .
The question for evangelism now is :
Do you have a take that is authentic and engaging in a way that works for the unchurched ? "

Today it really starts .
The Iowa caucuses are tonight , and by the end of the night of February 5 , 2008 , we ’ll almost certainly know who the two next presidential candidates from the major parties will be .
In the next 34 days , a field of 15 candidates , seven Republicans and eight Democrats , will be winnowed down to two .
Democratic candidates will campaign across 25 states ( excluding Michigan and Florida ) and the Republicans across 30 states , a process that requires resources that most of them just do n’t have .
In the next 34 days , candidates without a major war chest will find that they cannot compete in even a small number of the states required to win 50 % or more of the delegates , and they ’ll be forced to withdraw .
This will again illustrate , in pointed manner , both the corrosive influence of money on our national political process and the utter failure of the public election financing system .
Over the next 34 days , the national party that supposedly stands for voting rights , the Democratic Party , will intentionally and willfully disenfranchise the states of Michigan and Florida because they refused to abide by party rules .
At the same time , the Republican Party , the national party that supposedly stands on disenfranchisement for criminals and has a history of working against voter turnout , has refused to be so brazenly anti-American .
In the next 34 days , Democratic voters at primaries and caucuses will elect 55.6 % of their total delegates to the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver .
Similarly , Republican primary and caucus voters will elect 58.5 % of their delegates to the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis - St. Paul .
And in the process , over 44.4 % of all Democratic voters and 41.5 % of all Republican voters , representing 25 and 20 states respectively , will be disenfranchised .
Put another way , the two major parties will knowingly participate in a process that renders meaningless the votes of approximately 32 million Democratic voters and about 23 million Republican voters , about 27.3 % of the entire voting population of the United States .
And in the next 34 days , Congress will pass no bills to correct this .
The President will not direct the FBI to investigate voting irregularities .
The Supreme Court will not order the President to permit 55 million disenfranchised voters the right to vote for their candidate of choice and to have their vote matter .
And neither will the various state Governors and legislatures .
In the next 34 days ( maybe it will stretch to 39 days ) , we ’ll learn who the Democratic and Republican party candidates for President of the United States are .
We ’ll also learn , yet again , that we have earned the government we have , and that we deserve it .
God(s ) help us .

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Sandia National Laboratories charged a panel of outside experts with the task to design a 10,000 - year marking system for the WIPP ( Waste Isolation Pilot Plant ) site , and estimate the efficacy of the system against various types of intrusion .
The goal of the marking system is to deter inadvertent human interference with the site .
The panel of experts was divided into two teams .
This is the report of the A Team ; a multidisciplinary group with an anthropologist ( who is at home with different , but contemporary , cultures ) , an astronomer ( who searches for extra- terrestrial intelligence ) , an archaeologist ( who is at home with cultures that differ in both time and space from our own ) , an environmental designer ( who studies how people perceive and react to a landscape and the buildings within them ) , a linguist ( who studies how languages change with time ) , and a materials scientist ( who knows the options available to us for implementing our marking system concepts ) .
The report is a team effort .
There is much consensus on the design criteria and necessary components of the marking system .
Understandably , there is some divesity of opinion on some matters , and this is evident in the text .
We developed the following criteria for the marking system :
The site must be marked .
Aside from the legal requirement , the site will be indelibly imprinted by the human activity associated with waste disposal .
We must complete the process by explaining what has been done and why .
The site must be marked in such a manner that its purpose cannot be mistaken .
Other nuclear waste disposal sites must be marked in a similar manner within the U.S. and preferably world - wide .
A marking system must be utilized .
By this we mean that components of the marking system relate to one another is such a way that the whole is more than the sum of its parts .
Redundancy must play a preeminent role in the marking system design .
The designs considered here have redundancy in terms of message levels , marking system componenets , materials , and modes of communication .
Each component of the marking system should be made of material (s ) with little intrinsic value .
The destructive ( or recycling ) nature of people will pose a serious threat to the marking system .
The components of the marking system should be tested during the next few decades while the WIPP is in operation , not only for the longevity of the materials but for the pan-cultural nature of the message .
In other words , as with the repository design itself , the team was comfortable with the thought of designing a marking system that would last 10,000 years if left undisturbed .
Our efforts focused on making it understandable while providing minimal incentive to disturb it .
We also consider a public information effort a necessary part of the marking system design .
A system that is not understood today has no chance of being understood in the far future .
Figures 4.3 - 1 through 4.3-18 provide a basic description of our most developed design and other design options
The central area of interest is surrounded by earthen berms .
For the WIPP site , the area of interest is where we do not want drilling or excavation to occur .
In the design the central area is the area of the underground panels plus either ( 1 ) a one - fourth - mile buffer zone , or ( 2 ) the distance to which the radionuclides may migrate during the 10,000 - year period , whichever is larger .
The forms of the earthworks are jagged and rough , suggestive of energy radiating from the central area .
The berms serve several purposes .
First , they define the area of interest .
Their size is set so that sand dunes are unlikely to cover all of them entirely at the same time .
Instead , the wind will leave dunes streaming behind the berms and create an even larger marker .
Second , their shape sets the tone for the entire landscape -- non-natural , ominous , and repulsive .
Third , the corner berms are higher than the others and provide vantage points for viewing the entire site .
Fourth , the corner berms also include buried rooms with all the message levels recommended for inclusion in this marker system .
As the berms erode , these rooms will become uncovered at various times .
The investigator will be guided toward the center of the site by the berms .
Prior to entering the central area , however , he or she will encounter a " message kiosk " ( Figure 4.3-18 ) .
Each message kiosk is composed of a message wall and a protecting wall .
In terms if site layout , the message kiosks form the only " nurturing " part of the marking system design .
The protecting wall is of concrete and is meant to protect the message wall from erosion .
The message wall is of granite or other hard rock and is a vertical , curved form .
There are two reasons for a curved form : ( 1 ) it makes it very difficult to reuse the piece for another purpose , and ( 2 ) it is not an honorific form such as an obelisk .
The vertical aspect minimizes tensile stress on the components .
The message wall will bear what we call Level II and Level III messages ( cautionary and basic information , respectively ) .
The preliminary texts read :
Level II :
Level III :
These standing stones mark an area used to bury radioactive wastes .
The area is ... by ... kilometers ( or ... miles or about ... times the height of an average full - grown male person ) and the buried waste is ... kilometers down .
This place was chosen to put this dangerous material far away from people .
The rock and water in this area may not look , feel , or smell unusual but may be poisoned by radioactive wastes .
When radioactive matter decays , it gives off invisible energy that can destroy or damage people , animals , and plants .
Do not drill here .
Do not dig here .
Do not do anything that will change the rocks or water in the area .
Do not destroy this marker .
This marking system has been designed to last 10,000 years .
If the marker is difficult to read , add new markers in longer - lasting materials in languages that you speak .
For more information go to the building further inside .
The site was known as the WIPP ( Waste Isolation Pilot PLant ) site when it was closed in ...
2.1 Message definition
Modern understanding of the communications enterprise shows that there can be little separation of the content of a message from its form , and from its transportation vehicle .
They affect each other , and all of it is message .
McLuhan and Fiore [ Ref. 2 - 1 ] take that even further , arguing that " the medium is the message . "
Given this , rather than our attempting to first articulate messages , then to select their form , and then to design their vehicle , we choose to do as much of this simultaneously as is reasonable , attempting to accomplish
a Gestalt , in which more is received than sent ,
a Systems Approach , where the various elements of the communications system are linked to each other , act as indexes to each other , are co-presented and reciprocally reinforcing , and
Redundancy , where some elements of the system can be degraded or lost without substantial damage to the system 's capacity to communicate .
Everything on the site is conceived of as part of the message communication ... from the very size of the whole site - marking down to the design of protected inscribed reading walls and the shapes of materials and their joints .
In this report , the various levels of message content are described , as is the content of each level , the various modes of message delivery , and the most appropriate physical form of each .
We obviously recommend that a very large investment be made in the overall framework of this system , in the marking of the entire site , and in a communication mode that is non-linguistic , not rooted in any particular culture , and thus not affected by the expected certain transformation of cultures .
This mode uses species - wide archetypes ... of meanings bound to form , such that the physical form of the site and its constructions are both message content and mode of communication .
Thus , the most emphatically delivered mesage is the meaning - bonded - to - form in the site itself .
( See Section 4 for the message the site is asked to deliver . )
As part of a system of message communications , we recommend substantial use of verbal texts and graphics , but with little emphasis on constructed , non-natural , non-iconic symbols .
These texts and graphics act as indexes to each other , and act as indexes across message levels .
We also suggest the site be marked so it is anomalous to its surroundings in its physical properties such as electrical conductivity and magnetism .
2.2 Message levels and criteria
2.2.1 Message Levels
Givens [ Ref. 2 - 2 ] describes four information levels for the messages :
Level I : Rudimentary Information : " Something man - made is here "
Level II : Cautionary Information : " Something man -made is here and it is dangerous "
Level III : Basic Information : Tells what , why , when , where , who , and how ( in terms of information relay , not how the site was constructed )
Level IV : Complex Information : Highly detailed written records , tables , figures , graphs , maps and diagrams
Our discussions led to two expansions of Givens ' work .
First , we decided that it was possible to convey a sense of danger , foreboding , and dread without the use of language or pictures .
This would be done within the context of site design .
Under these circumstances , what would generally be considered as Level I components ( e.g. earthworks ) would be able to convey both Level I and Level II messages .
Second , we decided to have a fifth level that lays between Givens ' Level III and Level IV .
The new Level IV would have more detail than Level III but still not be a complete rulemaking record .
The latter is now called Level V. Specific examples of the different level message are given in Section 4.6.2 .
The general approach taken by the team is that the emphasis is on clarity and , where possible , brevity .
Overly long and complex messages will be too difficult and time - consuming to translate to be effective .
The message must be straightforward .
and neither understate nor overstate the hazards of the site .
The difficult in formulating the message is that many normal human activities , e.g. , house building and farming , can occur on the surface without jeopardizing the performance of the repository .
Problems begin only when deeper drilling and excavation occur .
We decided against a large radiation symbol prominently displayed on a marker lest the potential intruders take a quick reading , find nothing more than background radiation , and ignore the rest of the message .
We did decide that the incorporation of a radiation symbol was approriate within the larger context of the message .
As a symbol , it could provide a link between textual and pictorial information .
We decided against simple " Keep Out " messages with scary faces .
Museums and private collections abound with such guardian figures removed from burial sites .
These earlier warning messages did not work because the intruder knew that the burial goods were valuable .
We did decide to include faces portraying horror and sickness ( see Sections 3.3 and 4.5.1 ) .
Such faces would relate to the potential intruder wishing to protect himself or herself , rather than to protect a valued resource from thievery .
We decided against overstatement of the danger .
The " Touch one stone and you will die " approach is unacceptable because it is not credible .
Inevitably , someone will investigate the site in a non-intrusive manner .
Nothing will happen to the person , and the rest of the message will therefore be ignored .
There was consensus , however , on the need to mark the site and on the need to convey the dangers to the potential intruder .
We consider the key to a successful system to be a credible conveyance of the dangers of disturbing the repository .
We must inform potential intruders what lies below and the consequences of disturbing the waste .
If they decide that the value of the metal component of the waste fas outweighs the risks of recovering the metal , the decision is their responsibility , not ours .
The warning information is divided up into
4.1 Site design guidelines for a design of the entire site , so it is a major component of a system of messages
The Design Guidelines herein will be largely performance - based , that is , they describe how the design must perform , rather than what it must look like or be made of .
These guidelines can , in turn , be used as criteria to evaluate designs .
Because performance - based design guidelines do not describe the design , but rather what ht edesign must do , several alternative designs can be developed in response to the guidelines .
We have developed designs using the design guidelines , both as a test of the utility of the guidelines and as an expression of the team 's preferred solutions .
Because all the designs cover the entire interment , and then some , we refer to them as " site designs . "
These designs are presented in Section 4.2 .
In this discussion and then later in the descriptions of the designs that test these design guidelines we will use the expression " the Keep " to define an area whose size and shape is the " footprint " or the vertical projection on the site 's surface of the final interment area .
Our team 's analysis suggests that the final footprint may be larger than currently shown because of both migration of radionuclides in the salt and future expansion .
The various site designs may be listed as follows :
The site must be marked .
All levels of message complexity should be located on - ste .
Thus , communication vehicles for information at Levels I , II , III , and IV should be on the WIPP site and available to humans .
As well , this team has developed specific message content for each level , presented later in Section 4.6 .
The design of the whole site itself is to be a major source of meaning , acting as a framework for other levels of communication , reinforcing and being reinforced by those other levels in a system of communication .
The message that we believe can be communication non-linguistically ( through the design of the whole site ) , using physical form as a " natural language , " encompasses Level I and portions ( faces showing horror and sickness ) of Level II .
Put into words , it would communicate something like the following :
This place is a message ... and part of a system of messages ... pay attention to it !
Sending this message was impotant to us .
We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture .
This place is not a place of honor ... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here ... nothing valued is here .
What is here is dangerous and repulsive to us .
This message is a warning about danger .
The danger is in a particular location ... it increases toward a center ... the center of danger is here ... of a particular size and shape , and below us .
The danger is still present , in your time , as it was in ours .
The danger is to the body , and it can kill .
The form of the danger is an emanation of energy .
The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically .
This place is best shunned and left uninhabited .
All physical site interventions and markings must be understood as communicating a message .
It is not enough to know that this is a place of importance and danger ... you must know that the place itself is a message , that it contains messages , and is part of a system of messages , and is a system with redundance .
Redundancy of message communication is important to message survivability .
Redundancy should be achieved through : ( a ) a high frequency of message locations , permitting some to be lost ; ( b ) making direct and physical links among message levels , that is " co-presentation " of messages ; and ( c ) multiple and mutually reinforcing modes of communication .
It is expected that the number of presentations of messages will decrease as the message complexity ( or Level ) increases .
Thus , there will be many more presentations of Level II liquistic messages than of Level IV .
While the system of marking should strongly embody the principles of redundancy , at the same time the methods of achieving redundancy should be carefully designed to maintain message clarity .
Redundancy should not be achieved at the expense of clarity .
The method of site - marking must be very powerful to distinguish this place from all other types of places , so that the future must pay attention to this site .
The place 's physical structure should strongly suggest enhanced attention to itself and to its subelements .
To achieve this , the volume of human effort used to make and mark this place must be understood as massive , emphasizing its importance to us .
The site 's constructions must be seen as an effort at the scale of a grand and committed culture , far beyond what a group or sect or organization could do .
About scale : " Scale " refers to the perceived size relationship between a human and something ( like a house or a chair or a site ) .
When the size of a thing gets far larger than a person , changes in scale are not easily perceived or are experienced as irrelevant .
Thus , there is little difference to a person at ground level whether an earthwork is 1 mile or 2 miles long .
These distances are experienced as much the same .
What we propose as a marking for this site is already at a scale where it could be somewhat smaller or larger with no loss of meaning .
And further , if the design were to be replicated elsewhere , it could be ( somewhat ) scaled up or down with no loss of meaning .
Vertical masonry markers alone are simply not enough to accomplish our purposes .
They are not large enough , nor frequent enough , nor sufficiently distinguishing from other sites already so marked ; and their use elsewhere may well make their use here somewhat trivial and certainly ambguous .
If only markers are used here , they will be seen as much like markers on other sites , which are generally sites of far less import , and also tend to be marked because they are honorific or commemorative , the opposite of the message we seek to send .
Use a system of markeings that utilizes the whole site as an enormous mark , and that includes : smaller markers ; high points to climb from which to view the entire site ; walls and places to be in that co-locate viewers with messaegs ... an organized environment .
Consider the possible retention of a currently existing structure for symbolic purposes only , as a decaying massiveness .
As for use of existing - ste structures , if we assume no active institutional control , the only current above - ground site structure that might endure for a substantial portion of the 10,000 years would be the thick - walled concrete " hot " cell .
The other buildings will decay , or more probably be stripped of their valuable building materials for re-use .
The " hot " cell may be put to symbolic use by incorporating it into the site 's design , as a mute artifact suggesting something " strong " that needed to be contained , although from its large door size , a thing that had to be easily accessible and thus was ( probably ) not treasure .
And because the " hot " cell 's openings are randomly placed , rather than symmetrical , it would tend not to be mistaken for an honorific or privileged structure .
If the " hot " cell is kept , it should not be located in the geometric center of any open space , which would symbolically elevate its importance .
While this system of markings should represent an enormous effort and investment of resources on our part , the construction itself should be of materials of little value , and the workmanship should not bestow any value through the elegance of craft or artistry .
Doing substantial work on materials of little value suggests that the place is not commemorative of phenomena highly valued by the culture that made it , but as marking something important yet quite unvalued ... not a treasure , but its opposite ... a location of highly devalued material ( " dangerous garbage " or an " un-treasure " ) .
The place should not suggest shelter , protection or nurture ... it should suggest that it is not a place for dwelling , nor for farming or husbandry .
This would be most strongly communicated if the place obviously tries to deny inhabitation and utilization .
It might best be designed as a place difficult to be in , and to work in ... both actually and symbolically .
Given this , the center of the place should reject rather than embrace .
Any attractive focus on / near that center would suggest welcome , and by extension , occupancy and utilization .
We believe there is no physical barrier we can devise that ( some ) future technology cannot breach , and any attempt to bar entry physically to the Keep can and will be breached ( by cutting through it , going under it , or coming down from above ) .
Thus , any " barrier " placed around the Keep can only be purely symbolic , and should be used to enclose it only in a spatial sense rather than to attempt a fortification or a security barrier .
As to the meaning of " center " : physically to mark the WIPP site in any way makes it a different place from the surrounding desert , and creates a " figure " against a " ground . "
It makes a center in the desert .
For human beginnings , making a center ( " here we are " ) is the first act of marking order ( Cosmos ) out of undifferentiation ( Chaos ) .
All further meanings of " center " derive from this original positive valence .
The meanings of " center " have always been as a highly valued place or a gathering place ... the holy of holies ; the statue centered within the temple , itself centered within the settlement ; the dancing ground ; the sacred place as the physical and spiritual center of a people , etc .
In this project , we want to invert this symbolic meaning , to suggest that the center is not a place of privilege , or honor , or value , but its opposite .
In symbolic terms , we suggest that the largest portion of the Keep , its center , be left open , and few ( if any ) structures placed there , so that symbolically it is : uninhabitated , shunned , a void , a hole , a non-place .
As for the geometric center , placement of anything at dead - center of the Keep would suggest that it is of the utmost importance , occupying the place of greatest privilege .
We do not believe there is any one thing that can or should play that role on this site .
( For example , someone might suggest that the highest Level IV of information might be placed at the center .
But because a Level IV message may be gibberish to some intruders , while a Level II message would be well understood , no level of message is more important than any other , and no particular message or level is important enough to occupy the most privileged location . )
Design of the entire site and its subelements should avoid those forms that humans regularly tend to use to represent the " ideal , " " perfection , " or " aspiration . "
Aspiring forms are sky - reaching verticals , the obelisk , for example .
Ideal and perfect ones are the the perfect forms of symmetrical geometry ( spheres , pyramids , hexagons ) and of regular crystalline structures or polyhedrons .
If such forms are used , we suggest their perfection be undermined through substantial and obviously meant " irregularity , " as if its builders knew about the ideal and perfection , but asserted that this place is not about them .
More appropriate types of forms to use are amorphic or jagged and horizontal , a deliberate shunning of the values of " perfection " pr " aspiration . "
A major site - delivered message is that this place is ominous , not to be disturbed .
This Level II message can be delivered both through site design and through " reading walls , " discussed later .
Message levels will probably be delivered in a sequence , but no level of message is more valuable than another .
The design should incorporate this parity of levels .
While Level IV information is certainly the most complete and detailed of all our communications at the site , there are certainly plausible future scenarios under which it will be of less value than a Level II message , or even of no value at all , even if seen .
Thus , Level IV is more complex , but not a more valuable message to us ( or future people ) , and its location should symbolically bestow no more value or privilege on it than on other message levels .
The design should provide a general sense of the magnitude , shape , and location of the original danger .
Because there is no apparent danger at the site 's surface , the design makes it clear that the danger is below and threatens to escape .
The site design should also articulate that the dangerous material is bounded , has a substantial footprint that is of a certain shape .
Going out from this on - surface imprint might be concentric bands designed to signify diminishing danger .
It is not necessary to mark the Land Withdrawal boundary ; it is a legal boundary that will be meaningless in a few centuries .
The enormity of the site 's undertaking and its shape should be visible and comprehendible in its entirety , as a panorama .
A panorama , the " seeing - all " from an altitude , is an ancient human metaphor for knowing , and seeking it is natural .
Thus , provide elevated points for site viewing ( mound , ziggurat , tower ... all of which can be climbed for viewing ) .
The site - marking system should also function as a locator for multiple concepts of location and should : locate the site in relation to local centers of population of our time ( which may contain archives as part of the information system ) ; locate this site in relationship to other disposal sites in the world ; locate the viewer ( " you are here " ) on all three spatial axes in relationship to the entire site and its subelements , and to the hazard ; locate the construction of this site in time ; locate all on - site position of Level III and IV messages .
Presented [ here ] are several alternative designs for the entire site , followed by designs for some particular spaces on it .
These designs are based on the Design Guidelines just presented and thus act as tests of the efficacy of the guidelines .
Of the many designs developed and reviewed , these are also the design solutions most preferred by the team .
The designs utilize archetypical images whose physical forms embody and communicate meaning .
We have given them names , both for identification and as verbal images for each .
They are :
Landscape of Thorns
Spike Field
Spikes Bursting Through Grid
Leaning Stone Spikes
Menacing Earthworks
Forbidding Blocks
Some designs use images of dangerous emanations and wounding of the body .
Some are images of shunned land ... land that is poisoned , destroyed , parched , uninhabitable , unusable .
Some combine these images .
All designs entirely cover or define at least the interment area , called here the Keep .
Shunned land ... poisoned , destroyed , unusable :
" Black Hole " : A masonry slab , either of black Basalt rock , or black - dyed concrete , is an image of an enormous black hole ; an immense nothing ; a void ; land removed from use with nothing left behind ; a useless place .
It both looks uninhabitable and unfarmable , and it is , for it is exceedingly hot part of the year .
Its blackness absorbs the desert 's high sun-heat load and radiates it back .
It is a massive effort to make a place that is fearful , ugly , and uncomfortable .
The heat of this black slab will generate substantial thermal movement .
It should have thick expansion joints in a pattern that is irregular , like a crazy - quilt , like the cracks in parched land .
And the surface of the slab should undulate so as to shed sand in patterns in the direction of the wind .
" Rubble Landscape " : A square outer rim of the caliche layer of stone is dynamited and bulldozed into a crude square pile over the entire Keep .
This makes a rubble - stone landscape at a level above the surrounding desert , an anomaly both topographic and in roughness of material .
The outer rim from which rubble was pushed inward fills with sand , becoming a soft moat , probably with an anomalous pattern of vegetation .
This all makes for an enormous landscape of large - stone rubble , one that is very inhospitable , being hard to walk on and difficult to bring machinery onto .
It is a place that feels destroyed , rather than one that has been made .
Figure 4.3 - 3 . Spike Field , view 1 ( concept and art by Michael Brill ) .
Shapes that hurt the body and shapes that communicate danger : Danger seems to emanate from below , and out of the Keep in the form of stone spikes ( in Spike Field , Spikes Bursting Through Grid , and Leaning Stone Spikes ) , concrete thorns ( in Landscape of Thorns ) , and zig - zag earthworks emanating from the Keep ( in Menacing Earthworks ) .
The shapes suggest danger to the body ... wounding forms , like thorns and spikes , even lightning .
They seem active , in motion out and up , moving in various directions .
They are irregular or non-repetitive in their shape , location and direction .
They seem not controlled , somewhat chaotic .
In the three designs that use " fields " of spikes or thorns , these spikes or thorns come out of , and define the Keep , so the whole area that is dangerous to drill down into is so marked .

Figure 4.3 - 8 . Menacing Earthworks , view 1 ( concept and art by Michael Brill ) .
[ option recommended by Team A ]
" Menacing Earthworks " : Immense lightning - shaped earthworks radiating out of an open - centered Keep .
It is very powerful when seen both from the air and from the vantage points on the tops of the four highest earthworks , the ones just off the corners of the square Keep .
Walking through it , at ground level , the massive earthworks crowd in on you , dwarfing you , cutting off your sight to the horizon , a loss of connection to any sense of place .
Figure 4.3 - 9 .
Menacing Earthworks , view 2 ( concept by Michael Brill and art by Safdar Abidi ) .
[ option recommended by Team A ]
The large expanse of center is left open , with only two elements in it : the WIPP 's existing thick - walled concrete hot cell , left to ruin ; a walk - on world map showing locations of all the repositories of radioactive waste on earth and a 50 - foot wide map of New Mexico with the WIPP site in the geometric center of the Keep .
The entire map is domed in order to shed sand blown by the wind .
Underneath the slightly domed map a Level 4 room is buried .
Four other rooms are located under the four tallest earthworks .
Reading walls are strewn between the earthworks , encountered before the Keep is entered .

A perspectve view of the repository for Level III messages showing waste panels , shafts , marker features , and the reader 's present location on the surface ( arrow ) .
Figure 4.3 - 14 .
Forbidding Blocks , view 1 ( concept and art by Michael Brill ) .
" Forbidding Blocks " :
Stone from the outer rim of an enormous square is dynamited and then cast into large concrete / stone blocks , dyed black .
Each is about 25 feet on a side .
They are deliberately irregular and distorted cubes .
The cubic blocks are set in a grid , defining a square , with 5 - foot wide " streets " running both ways .
You can even get " in " it , but the streets lead nowhere , and they are too narrow to live in , farm in , or even meet in .
It is a massive effort to deny use .
At certain seasons it is very , very hot inside because of the black masonry 's absorption of the desert 's high sun-heat load .
It is an ordered place , but crude in form , forbidding , and uncomfortable .
Figure 4.3 -15 .
Forbidding Blocks , view 2 ( concept by Michael Brill and art by Safdar Abidi ) .
Some blocks can be of granite , or faced with it , and carry inscriptions .
Their closeness to other blocks reduces their exposure and increases their durability .
Note our use of irregular geometries and denial of craftsmanship .
None of our designs uses any of the regular or " ideal " geometric forms , and only crude craftsmanship is sought , except for the precision of engraved messages .
Why ?
the geometry of ideal forms , like squares and cubes , circles and spheres , triangles and pyramids is a fundamental human invention , a seeking of perfection in an imperfect world .
Historically , people have used these ideal forms in places that embody their aspirations and ideals .
In our designs , there is much iregularity both of forms and in their locations and directions , yet done by people with obvious knowledge of pure geometry .
This shows as understanding of the ideal , but at the same time a deliberate shunning of it ... suggesting we do not value this place , that it is not one that embodies our ideals .
The same is true of craft and workmanship .
Historically , people use good workmanship to bestow value on things they value .
In most of our schemes , the structures that cover or define the Keep 's " cover " are made crudely , or of materials that prohibit workmanship ( such as rubble , or earthworks , or a large slab ) .
At the same time , we make an enormous investment of labor in these rude materials .
It speaks of a massive investment , but one not tinged with pride or honored with value - through - workmanship .
About durability :
All the designs , except one , have a high probability of lasting 10,000 years .
This is because of their conformity with the guidelines for materials durability in Section 4.4 .
The concrete structures of the Landscape of Thorns have projecting , cantilevered elements that will have tension in their upper surfaces , causing minute cracks .
These cracks will accelereate local decay .
Until new materials are available , or new methods for tensioning concrete members [ are found ] , we cannot " guarantee " the durability of this design .
However , we present it here because of its strong emotive character .
5.2
The enormity of marking the WIPP site ( FN )
If the WIPP is ever operational , the site may pose a greater hazard than is officially ackowledged .
Yet the problems involved in marking the site to deter inadvertent intrusion for the next 10,000 years are enormous .
Even if knowledge exists that would allow translation of the message on the markers , there might be little motivation to solicit such knowledge .
Pictorial messages , however , are unreliable and may even convey the opposite of what is intended .
This panel member therefore recommends that the markers and the structures associated with them be conceived along truly gargantuan lines .
To put their size into perspective , a simple berm , say 35 - m wide and 15 - m high , surrounding the proposed land - withdrawal boundary , would involve excavation , transport , and placement of around 12 million cubic meters of earth .
What is proposed , of course , is on a much greater scale than that .
By contrast , in the construction of the Panama Canal , 72.6 million cubic meters were excavated , and the Great Pyramid occupies 2.4 million cubic meters .
In short , to ensure the probability of success , the WIPP marker undertaking will have to be one of the greatest public works ventures in history .
5.3 Personal thoughts ( WS )
Working on this panel , always fascinating and usually enlightening too , has led to the following personal thoughts :
(a) We have all become very marker - prone , but should n't we nevertheless admit that , in the end , despite all we try to do , the most effective " marker " for any intruders will be a relatively limited amount of sickness and death caused by the radioactive waste ?
In other words , it is largely a self - correcting process if anyone intrudes without appropriate precautions , and it seems unlikely that intrusion on such buried waste would lead to large - scale disasters .
An analysis of the likely number of deaths over 10,000 years due to inadvertent intrusion should be conducted .
This cost should be weighted against that of the marker system .
( b) The design and testing of markers and messages must involve a broad spectrum of societies and people within those societies .
So - called " experts " can of course make important contributions , but they must listen carefully to all other people who represent those who might encounter the markers .
In the course of working on this project , I received excellent ideas from a wide range of undergraduates , colleagues , friends , and relatives .
( c) The very exercise of designing , building , and viewing the markers creates a powerful testimony addressed to today 's society about the full environmental , social , and economic costs of using nuclear materials .
We can never know if we indeed have successfully communicated with our descendants 400 generations removed , but we can , in any case , perhaps convey an important message to ourselves .
5.6 " Beauty is conserved , ugliness discarded " ( DGA )
To design a marker system that , left alone , will survive for 10,000 years is not a difficult engineering task .
It is quite another matter to design a marker system that will for the next 400 generations resist attempts by individuals , organized groups , and societies to destroy or remove the markers .
While this report discusses some strategies to discourage vandalism and recycling of materials , we cannot anticipate what people , groups , societies may do with the markers many millenia from now .
A marker system should be chosen that instills awe , pride , and admiration , as it is these feelings that motivate people to maintain ancient markers , monuments , and buildings .

Letter from Mike Gravel :
A Letter from Mike Gravel also posted on the Huffington Post
Tuesday , October 23 , 2007
In the past year , I have attended 11 national Democratic debates of which two were sponsored by corporate media giant NBC .
However , last week , NBC suddenly conjured up arbitrary polling and fundraising requirements specifically designed to exclude me .
None of the previous debates I attended held such requirements .
When my staff called NBC directly to find out why I was now barred from attending , Chuck Todd , NBC news ' political director , told us that there were three criteria we did not meet , namely that I had not campaigned in New Hampshire and / or Iowa at least 14 times in the past year , that I was not polling at 5 % and that I had n't raised $ 1 million .
It is clear that NBC just wants me out of the race .
This was made evident by the fact that NBC did not even inform me of its
arbitrary criteria before making the decision to stifle my
campaign .
NBC's Todd waited until 5 p.m. on Friday , Oct. 19 , to
inform my staff that I was not invited to the Oct. 30 debate at
Drexel University in Philadelphia .
That 's a fact !
Since I announced my candidacy for the Democratic Nomination for President of the United States on April 17 , 2006 , I have certainly traveled to New Hampshire and Iowa at least 14 times .
And , according to a recent CNN poll , I am tied with Joe Biden , Dennis Kucinich and Chris Dodd .
NBC claims I have n't raised enough money to qualify .
I 'm proud of the fact that I do n't collect millions from special interests ( or
fugitives like Norman Hsu ) .
The reason why Senator Hillary Clinton seems to have a fundraising scandal every month is because money has corrupted our democracy .
By stifling my voice on the basis of fundraising dollars , NBC is reinforcing the power of money over our national political discussion and our freedom .
But why has NBC suddenly come up with " requirements " designed to exclude me from the debate ?
NBC 's decision is proof that our corporate media do not want a
genuine debate over our impending war with Iran .
During the last debate I was the only one to aggressively confront Senator Clinton over her vote to label the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization .
Had I not brought up the subject , seasoned NBC commentator Tim Russert , the moderator of the Sept. 26 debate , would not have even asked about it .
Most Americans still do n't appreciate the gravity of that vote and they do n't understand that our government is intentionally raising roadblocks to diplomacy .
Corporate media have once again failed to investigate how Bush and a compliant congress have set us on the warpath .
Instead the media simply parrots the demonization of Iranian President Ahmadinejad and the administration 's unproven accusations against Iran .
NBC and the other corporate media have jumped on the war bandwagon and they are determined to shut up anyone who tries to stop it .
The fact that NBC is owned by General Electric , one of the world 's leading military contractors , is frightening and certainly smacks of censorship directed at the most outspoken critic of the influence that the military - industrial complex holds over this
great nation .
In the past decade , GE has benefited financially from the global war on terrorism and currently holds almost $ 2 billion in military contracts .
So I ask that anyone , who is as concerned as I am about the power of the mainstream media and the military - industrial complex , speak out in support of my campaign today .
Here are 3 powerful things you can do :
1 . Sign the online petition to have me included in the debate !
http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/letgravelspeakoct30
2. Contact NBC and GE and tell them they are wrong for trying to stifle my campaign !
Here are there emails you can copy / paste into our " TO : " field of your email .
chuck.todd@nbcuni.com , viewerservices@msnbc.com ,
directors@corporate.ge.com , ombudsperson@corporate.ge.com ,
jeff.zucker@nbcuni.com , lynn.calpeter@nbcuni.com ,
steve.capus@nbcuni.com
3. Email the DNC at http://www.democrats.org/page/s/contact
Finally , since the powers that be now require that I raise $ 1
million in order to participate in the debates , please make a
donation to my campaign .
I will not stop .
In fact , this fuels my fire even more .
Unlike my fellow candidates , I am not focused on raising millions of dollars ; I am focused on fixing representative government .
Help us reach that arbitrary threshold for financing and I will continue to fight for democracy and peace for all of us , not just the wealthy .
Best ,
Mike

Comment by NBC :
GRAVEL RESPONSE
Posted : Monday , October 22 , 2007 9:05 AM by Mark Murray
( Mark Murray is NBC Deputy Political Director )
Thanks for your emails about the recent decision not to include former Sen.
Mike Gravel at the next MSNBC debate .
As you may already know , no network has given Gravel more of an opportunity to get his message across than NBC and its affiliates .
But with the election season beginning in just 73 days , and more candidates ( 135 alone on the Dem side ) trying to get into our debates , we believed it was necessary to have some minimum standards .
Leaders and activists from both parties believe our requirements are very fair .
Unfortunately , Gravel did not meet those requirements .
The standards we used included measuring the amount of time the senator spent campaigning , as well as poll standing and financial resources .
Mike Todd is NBC 's political director .
Me , I 'm going to change the channel when he comes on , unless this policy is changed .
Who the hell is Mike Todd to decide who participates in the Democratic primary .
Gravel is a major contender .
I challenge NBC to post a poll to see what its viewers think .
Gravel 's suggestion , that NBC owner GE is playing with the presidential selection process , keeps coming into my head .
This is beyond shameful .
It verges on criminal .
In earlier days of the US democracy , it would have been illegal .
Today , it just should n't be .
I call for the other Democratic presidential candidates to speak up on the behalf of Gravel .
Clinton and Edwards should be the first , since they were caught whispering , some months ago , about trying to get rid of the lesser candidates .
That might redeem them for their bad intentions .
On H&C last night after the MI primary , Colmes asked Huckabee to comment on his theocratic rant to change the Constitution to line up with the word of God in his eyes .
Download Download
Colmes :
When you make statements like that , changing the Constitution in keeping with your God .
Huckabee :
On two things .
The context is two things .
Human life amendment , which I support and which has been in the Republican platform since 1980 .
And by the way , Fred Thompson does n't support it , nor does John McCain .
And yet it 's part of our platform and it's a very important part of our platform to say that human life is something we 're going to stand for .
And the second thing is traditional marriage .
So those are the two areas in which I 'm talking about .
I 'm not suggesting that we re-write the constitution to reflect tithing or Sunday school attendance .
I want to make that very clear .
Nice try there Mike .
Two things is two things too many .
What would be next ?
A " Wives to obey their husbands " amendment ? " Richard Land would certainly be thrilled .
Huckabee laughs it off as really just part of what Republicans think anyway so what 's the big deal ?
I have to agree with him on that one completely .
Huckabee is stating the words that are at the heart of Newt 's Southern Strategy in the 90's and Reagan in the 80's .
Digby reminds us of this one :
The president of the United States interrupted his vacation ( something he would n't do even when faced with a terrorist threat ) to sign legislation to keep one brain damaged woman alive against her will in a naked pander to the religious right .
This stuff is SOP to Republicans .
They agree with it .
PFAW 's Peter Montgomery says :
Does Huckabee mean what he said ?
Does he want an amendment to make divorce unconstitutional ?
What other ways would he amend the Constitution to meet his interpretation of “ God ’s standards ? ”
Mike Huckabee ’s desperate push to energize his supporters is revealing his deeply flawed view of our Constitution , and reminding Americans why the separation of church and state is so important .
It was such a cowardly way to mark the birthday of such a courageous man .
After the parade honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday afternoon , a mob of teenagers swarmed a 7 - Eleven store just off the parade route on King Boulevard .
They grabbed candy , cookies , sodas , chips -- ransacking the store in the process -- and ran out without paying .
The commotion lasted less than a minute .
The damage was minor .
No one was hurt .
Unless you count the heartache felt by the store ’s owner , Sundeep Bhatia , as he watched the ugly spectacle .
Advertisement
“ Every day we have shoplifters , ” Bhatia told me .
“ But for these kids to come from the parade and do this kind of stuff , on such a sacred day as this .
. . . “
Bhatia came here from India 20 years ago and spent 10 years working two jobs to save enough money to buy a 7 - Eleven store in Inglewood , then another on King Boulevard near Crenshaw .
He ’s reconciled himself to the high cost of doing business in inner-city Los Angeles .
At the King Boulevard store , he spent $ 82,000 on security guards last year .
He has 16 surveillance cameras streaming video to a backroom monitor .
He contracts with a security firm that can summon the LAPD instantly and broadcasts periodic alerts over the store ’s loudspeaker to let customers know they ’re being watched .
Still , most of the time , he and his employees watch helplessly as shoplifters victimize the store .
“ Sometimes you try to stop them and they threaten you , ” he said .
“ It ’s not worth a confrontation . ”
Advertisement
But on Tuesday -- after a night of soul - searching about whether to go public -- Bhatia e-mailed me .
“ You need to see and write something that sends a message , ” he wrote .
“ Otherwise these kids will be future criminals . ”
I visited his store Wednesday and watched a security - monitor replay of Monday ’s commotion .
On the screen , a horde of teenagers seemed to materialize out of nowhere , dashing between cars in the strip mall parking lot and pouring through the store ’s double doors .
The youths fanned out and swept down the aisles , knocking things off shelves , stuffing their pockets , shoving things under their baggy jackets .
An employee rushed over to block the entrance , to keep more from coming in .
He was shoved out of the way by the raucous crowd , as the teenagers burst through the door to leave .
Advertisement
I counted at least 30 kids inside .
They were clearly acting on a plan ; there were too many and they moved too quickly toward their targets for their actions to be random .
They seemed to be in high spirits , shouting and laughing the whole time .
Most were boys , but a few girls were among them .
And though it was hard to tell on the grainy video , all the kids I could see looked black to me .
And so , I took it personally .
It ’s probably too much to expect them to really feel inspired by -- or indebted to -- Martin Luther King Jr .
They have never been forced to drink from “ colored ” water fountains or forbidden from checking into a whites - only hotel -- experiences seared into my memory during summer visits as a child to my grandparents ’ farm in Alabama .
They ’re probably too young to even remember the national hand - wringing over whether to declare King ’s birthday a holiday .
They ’ve been bequeathed a civil rights icon that , through the passage of time and the evolution of history , has been reduced to a one - dimensional symbol of sit-ins and speeches .
Advertisement
Still , it was painfully ironic to see the crowd of rowdy black teens , likely fresh from the parade , flaunting their disrespect so brazenly .
Bhatia told me he spent the morning watching televised tributes to King and the afternoon among the multicultural throngs watching the parade .
“ Everybody was so happy , everything was so nice .
Then afterward , this , ” he said , shaking his head as he gestured toward the images on the security screen .
What did those kids think we were celebrating , with all those choirs and bands and drill teams in the street ?
Other than a day out of school and a shoe sale at the mall , what does the King holiday really mean ?
I felt disappointed and embarrassed watching the tape , and found myself apologizing to him , as if I bore some sort of collective responsibility .
But Bhatia reminded me that King ’s legacy does n’t belong only to people who look like me , just as he cannot lay singular claim to the moral lessons of Gandhi .

King “ was not just for one person , one race .
What he did was for everybody , ” Bhatia said .
“ And his message ought to be respected . ”
Bhatia is not sure what he ’ll do next .
He reported the incident to the LAPD , but knows that petty thefts rank low among its priorities .
He ’s called officials at nearby Dorsey High , but knows from past experience not to expect a call back .
He wonders -- and so do I -- what these kids ’ parents would think if they saw the tape he played for me .
The tape rolls again and I lean in to study the screen -- zoom in , zoom out , through 16 scenes .
I see a girl stuff her pockets with candy bars , crowds of boys snatching chips and sodas , a display of bottled water knocked to the floor .
Surely some of those kids knew what they were doing was wrong .
But they found it easier to go along with the mob than find the courage to speak up or stop .
What a mockery of the choices Dr. King made .
And what a sad taint on a “ sacred ” day .

" The most dangerous places to connect are airports , hotels , convention centers , " say Richard Rushing , Chief Security Officer for AirDefense , which does wireless security .
" And most people use credit cards there . "
Oops .
I am hooking up to the San Diego Convention Center 's wireless and paying for with a credit card as he says this .
Apparently lots of other people are too because a snicker rings through the workshop here at ToorCon9 .
By their nature , WiFi hotspots are insecure , he says , though they can be made more secure by using client isolation , which makes it harder to slide up and down the communications links from the server to the client and web .
" Client isolation should be turned on but we can still spoof the address or take the address backwards , " he says , noting that Macs are easily spoofed .
" Hot spots are really set up for the bad guys , " he says .
When Rushing looked at hotspot users , he found 30 percent have no firewalls and 3 percent have active malware they 're inadvertantly introducing to the servers .
24 percent of the users never disconnect after they were done .
" It 's like standing at an ATM when you 're done , counting your money . "
Most users developed very strong password and then sent over clear text so they can easily be grabbed .
Most firewalls designed to defeat the pings and scans but are easily spoofed .
What can a hotspot user do ?
\– Use prepaid wireless cards
\ –Use known hotspots , not airports , hotels , convention centers and libraries ; where countless anonymous users come and go and the provider has no social connection to the users .
Rushing says there 's a growing number of baby boomers using library and hotspot wireless to do their banking because they do n't want to set up at home .
\ –Do n't do your banking on public networks .
Use prepaid credit cards when you 're not sure about the security on the network .
\–Fortify your laptop if you 're using hotspots , he says , with regret .
" What I 've learned from looking at hotspots is that your laptop i's on its own , so you better take care of it . "
" Hotspots are great for browsing , but for personal stuff , be very wary , " Rushing said .
It is striking that so many conservatives spend so much energy condemning gays .
They do n’t just criticize gays ; they condemn gays with intense passion .
Nor does this process of moral judgment usually involve any sort of delicate weighing process .
Too often it is a visceral and unrelenting moral harpooning delivered by the likes of Ted Haggard — or , at least , the sort of judgment previously delivered by the then - closeted version of Ted Haggard , whose name is now synonymous with “ reaction formation . ”
Many of the people who condemn gays on street corners and pulpits remind me of steam boilers on the verge of blowing up .
Anti-gay bigots are rarely if ever attempting to work through the details of any of the three main historical philosophical approaches to morality ( consequentialism , deontology or virtue ) when they condemn gays .
No , there is nothing much philosophical about the way most people rail against the gays .
They are not driven by any sort of philosophy .
In my experience , they are primarily driven by disgust .
What especially disturbs conservative Christians are images of men kissing men and men having sex with other men .
Such images are so incredibly disgusting to those who hate gays that it has become a favorite insult on the streets and in the military to shout “ You ’re GAY ! ”
And when this insult is hurled in the process of casting moral judgment , it is done by people whose faces are contorted with utter disgust .
Because such condemnations of gays are so visceral , this raises the issue of whether disgust is a valid basis for morality .
My “ gut reaction ” has been that disgust is a senseless , arbitrary and unworkable basis for a moral system .
There are many reasons .
If disgust is a proper foundation for morality , who gets to decide what is disgusting ?
The conservative Christians of the United States would certainly step up to claim that right and responsibility .
After all , they claim that the U.S. is a “ Christian Nation ” and that they are especially inspired and guided by the Creator of the Universe .
They are also quite sure that gay sex is immoral .
They never seem to tire of making that public pronouncement .
And why stop at homosexuality ?
Disgust could also serve as the basis for many other “ moral ” positions .
Therefore , whoever becomes the arbiter of morality - based - on - disgust would also attempt to educate the rest of us as to the evils of nude beaches , public breast - feeding , body piercing , abortion and euthanasia .
All of us should be wary about accepting disgust as a basis for morality , however .
Demographics are shifting and , someday , conservative Christians might be on the receiving end of moral judgment based upon disgust .
How so ?
According to the dictates of other cultures American Christians do all kinds of disgusting things .
They should clean up their own act .
Christians do disgusting things like eating pork and wearing leather .
Christian women expose their faces and their legs , they talk with men to whom they are not married and sometimes they kiss men in public .
Christian women are sometimes so bold as to appear in public while they are menstruating .
Christians often use their left hands and they commonly wear shoes inside of their homes .
Their homes are filthy because they often live with dogs and cats - some of them sleep with their pet animals .
They drink shameful substances such as alcohol and milk .
These sorts of “ disgusting ” things could justify lengthy prison sentences in many cultures .
Shame on Christians !
Whoever we choose our arbiter of disgust , then next step is obvious .
Disgust is a favorite excuse for persecuting members of out - groups .
Disgust is thus the unspoken foundation for bigotry .
European Americans have historically characterized people from Africa and China as “ dirty ” as the basis for depriving them of basic legal rights and human decencies .
The same thing now goes for gays , who conservative Christians commonly characterize as animalistic and unhygienic .
How often have you heard this comment : “ What ’s next , bestiality ? ”
At this site , I have often argued that “ disgusting ” things tend to be those things that remind us that humans are animals .
According to many conservative Christians , though , we are not in the same league as animals , as evidenced by our invisible “ souls . ”
We are higher than animals , evidenced by the Chain of Being .
This fits in nicely with the up / down metaphor described by Mark Johnson and George Lakoff .
In Metaphors We Live By , Johnson and Lakoff explain that “ virtue , goodness and status ” are all seen as “ up . ”
In Moral Imagination : Implications of Cognitive Science for Ethics ( 1993 ) , Mark Johnson explores various metaphors for moral character ( page 50 ) .
One of the primary metaphors used for moral character is purity / pollution .
The “ moral , ” rational self is high , while the “ lower ” self is associated with the body and bodily functions .
This up / down , high / low orientation comes to be correlated with purity versus impurity .
The body , with its passions and desires , ties us to that which is dirty , polluted and computer .
The mind , as the seat of reason and will , tries to maintain its purity of rising above and trying to control the body .
Examples :
She kept herself pure throughout it all .
His motives / intentions were pure .
Sandy seems to have no moral blemishes .
“. . . without spot of sin . ”
“ Oh Lord , create a pure heart within me . ”
Nixon authorized dirty tricks .
Scarlet was washed clean from sin .
We must keep that fills out of our schools .
That trash will ruin our children ’s character .
Pornography pollutes the mind and soul .
He lives in a cocaine sewer .
That stinks !
( Said of an immoral action ) .
The animal connection is a slippery slope , of course , because humans are animals , which opens up a potential cornucopia of bigotry for anyone with an imagination .
The recipe is straightforward : anybody you dislike is animalistic or subhuman , justifying all kinds of mistreatment and bigotry .
Many of the people who are struggling socially or economically ( think of the homeless ) engage in behavior many people would consider disgusting , as evidenced by comments made by police officers and social workers who sometimes enter the homes of such people .
If not carefully constrained , this sense of disgust could be used to further ostracize these millions of people .
I ’m suspicious of disgust as a basis for morality because many things that are ostensibly disgusting are good and necessary .
As a teenager , I vividly remember reading The Agony and the Ecstasy , the story of Michelangelo .
Especially intriguing were Michelangelo ’s surreptitious journeys to graveyards where he dissected corpses in order to become a better artist .
The same thing goes for doctors , who must dissect cadavers in anatomy courses , engaging in behavior that many people consider disgusting in order to become proficient doctors .
At bottom , however , my main concern is that disgust is such a primal reaction .
It seems too simplistic to rely on disgust as a moral yardstick .
Why rely upon a primitive unthinking reaction , when other , much more sophisticated and self - correcting yardsticks are available ?
Why rely on disgust when we could be focusing on consequentialism , deontology or virtue ) .
Next to the Golden Rule ( or any other formulation regarding reciprocity ) , disgust seems especially trite and coarse .
Disgust would be the sort of basis on which a toddler would be expected to make moral judgments , not adults .
Adults should not be judging and enforcing conduct of other adults on the basis that something is “ icky . ”
I have been thinking about disgust as a basis for morality in reaction ever since reading some especially thoughtful articles by Jonathan Haidt , a psychologist at the University of Virginia .
Haidt spends considerable time on this topic of disgust in his 2006 book , The Happiness Hypothesis : Finding Modern Truth and Ancient Wisdom .
The starting point for much of Haidt ’s work is that liberals and conservatives keep talking past each other on moral issues :
On issue after issue , liberals want to maximize autonomy by removing limits , barriers , and restrictions .
The religious right , on the other hand , wants to structure personal , social and political relationships in three dimensions and so create a landscape of purity and pollution where restrictions maintain the separation of the sacred and the profane .
For the religious right , Hell on Earth is a flatland of unlimited freedom where selves roam around with no higher purpose than expressing and developing themselves .
( Page 210 ) .
Liberal politics gives wide deference to the self , to the right of individuals to choose their own destiny , to pursue happiness as they see fit .
It is an ownership society based on the assumption that the citizens own their own lives .
For conservatives , it ’s not that simple and I disagree with them .
That other people might see my life as “ disgusting ” is of no legal import .
Nor should it have moral consequences that others see my life - choices as disgusting .
Or should it ?
Disgust is not actually something we can understand in isolation .
Disgusting things are found toward one end of a long scale .
On the other end of that same scale we find things that give us the feeling of beauty or awe .
This suggests to me that there is overlap between aesthetics and morality .
To some extent , that which is morally proper is infused with beauty and those things that are morally repugnant are infested with ugliness .
Jonathan Haidt writes persuasively that each of us understands and runs our lives based on both endpoints of this scale , whether or not we proclaim any belief in any supernatural being .
In The Sacred and the Profane , [ Mircea ]
Eliade shows that the perception of sacredness is a human universal .
Regardless of their differences , all religions have places ( temples , shrines , holy trees ) , times ( holy days , sunrise , solstices ) , and activities ( prayer , special dancing ) that allow for contact or communication with something otherworldly and pure .
To mark off sacredness , all other times , places and activities are defined as profane ( ordinary , not sacred ) .
The borders between the sacred and the profane must be carefully guarded , and that ’s what rules of purity and pollution are all about .
Eliade says that the modern
West is the first culture in human history that has managed to strip time and space of all sacredness and to produce a fully practical , efficient , and profane world .
This is the world that religious fundamentalists find unbearable and are sometimes willing to use force to fight against .
Eliade ’s most compelling point , for me , is that sacredness is so irrepressible that it intrudes repeatedly into the modern profane world in the form of “ crypto religious ” behavior .
Eliade noted that even a person committed to a profane existence has privileged places , qualitatively different from all others–a man ’s birthplace , or the scenes of his first love , or certain places in the first foreign city he visited in his youth .
Even for the most frankly nonreligious man , all these places still retain an exceptional , a unique quality ; they are the “ holy places ” of his private universe , as if it were in such spots that he had received the revelation of a reality other than that in which he participates through his ordinary daily life .
When I read this , I gasped .
Eliade had perfectly pegged my feeble spirituality , limited as it is , to places , books , people and events that have given me moments of uplift and enlightenment .
Even atheists have intimations of sacredness , particularly when in love or in nature .
We just do n’t infer that God caused those feelings .
These passages got me thinking too .
There are certain places and things that I hold sacred , albeit in a provisional and private sense .
I do n’t expect anyone else to agree with me as to what I find sacred .
I certainly would not try to compel anyone to agree with me as to what is sacred .
But , to me , some things seem sacred ( in a secular sense ) .
Here are some examples from my life : Darwin ’s tomb , redwood trees , my children , the first house I remember living in , a wristwatch my grandfather gave me when I was eight .
I recognize these objects and places as special , even . . . holy ( though , again , not holy in any supernatural sense ) .
Now that I ’ve admitted that I recognize the awe - inspiring and privately - holy side of the scale , I also see that I make use of the other side of the scale too : those things that are disgusting .
Certain things are just “ over the line ” for me .
It disgusts me to see people ruining their own bodies by eating , drinking or smoking themselves to death .
It disgusts me to see people abusing their children .
I ’m disgusted by intolerance and bigotry .
I ’m disgusted when I see people filling the young children ’s minds with superstition , fear and intolerance .
I would be disgusted if I saw people having sexual intercourse in inappropriate places such as in the middle of a shopping mall or in front of a grade school .
Many things about Las Vegas ( as a tourist attraction ) are repulsive to me , my problem centering on the amorality and wasteful extravagance .
It ’s not that each of these things is equally disgusting , but I am repulsed and disgusted by these sorts of things ( this is not an exhaustive list ) .
My self - analysis regarding awe - inspiring and disgusting things convinced me to moderate my position on the role of disgust on moral issues .
After doing some soul - searching in preparing to write this post , I came to the conclusion that disgust does play a role in my own moral judgment .
To what extent does disgust play a role in my own moral thinking ?
I ’m not sure that I can parse out the effects of disgust , though I know it is there .
For instance , it is impossible for me to rule out that disgust is a factor in my view that murder and child abuse are immoral .
I am sure that I am viscerally repulsed by such conduct .
Perhaps it is my disgust that gives me the confidence to hold other people to my moral standard regarding such things as murder or child abuse .
Disgust comes in several flavors and likely plays a role in everyone ’s moral thinking .
To explore your own sensitivity to disgust , I invite you to visit Haidt ’s psychology website and taking his Disgust Scale survey ( it takes about 10 minutes ) .
Others have recently commented on the connection between disgust and moral judgment .
In an article called “ The Depths of Disgust , ” in the June 14 , 2007 edition of Nature ( available only to subscribers online ) , Dan Jones asks whether there is “ wisdom to be found in repugnance ” or whether disgust offers “ nothing but support to prejudice . ”
His conclusion is that disgust is a deep - seated emotion that is inextricably entangled with morality , though it is too often a poor guide to ethical action .
Jones points out that disgust has adaptive value that was honed by evolution .
Its function “ seems to be to prevent people from eating contaminated foodstuffs and to get rid of any they have ingested .
Disgust is related to bodily purity and integrity , with things that should be on the outside - such as feces - out , and things that should be on the inside - such as blood - kept in . ”
What is the connection between visceral disgust and social disgust ?
We should first define a term .
Haidt ’s website defines “ core disgust ” as
the “ core ” of the emotion , which is about defending the mouth from contamination by dirty or inappropriate things like body excretions , certain animals like rats and cockroaches , and certain foods , like ice cream with ketchup .
In the Nature article , Dan Jones writes that experiments have shown that “ core disgust ” and socio-moral versions of disgust
recruit overlapping brain areas , particularly the lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex , suggesting that the emotions are related .
These regions of the brain are activated by an unpleasant sensory stimuli , and they connect with other emotion - related areas , such as the amygdala .
When experimental subjects were asked whether they would wear “ Hitler ’s carefully laundered sweater ” and they refused to do so , they were relying upon some of the same brain areas that repel us from eating rotting food , for instance .
Haidt thinks he has found clues pointing to a physiological reality for moral disgust .
Whereas anger pushes the heart rate up , feeling visceral disgust makes it drop .
With his student Cary Sherman , Haidt showed people hooked up to a heart monitor video footage of morally negative but not viscerally disgusting behavior , such as an American neo -Nazi meeting .
The participants said that the video triggered disgust and anger , and on average their heart rates fell , not rose .
What ’s more , those who reported increased clenching in their throat had a greater drop in heart rate , making the link with core disgust look stronger .
“ We think that this is the first physiological evidence that socio- moral disgust really is disgust and not just metaphor or anger , says Haidt of the as yet unpublished work .
The Nature article presents evidence that this visceral disgust can affect ethical judgments .
When viewing pictures of drug addicts or homeless people , the amygdala and the insula fired up ( indicating fear and disgust , respectively ) but the prefrontal cortex ( which normally is active when considering people in social situations ) was less active .
This experiment indicates that disgust can trump empathy and compassion .
“ When we respond to a homeless person with disgust , we avoid considering the person ’s mind , says [ psychologist Susan Fiske ] .
“ We treat the person as equivalent to a pile of garbage . ”
The Nature article also cites Marc Hauser , who holds that disgust is an emotion of distancing “ of avoiding or expelling the contaminant . ”
Disgust is thus capable of fueling the expulsion of out - group members .
Brazilian cognitive neuroscientist Jorge Moll explains that the system for making moral judgments was “ cobbled together ” from pre-existing brain systems .
The experimental data point to the possibility that our disgust system might have been adapted by evolution to allow us to reject or disapprove of abstract concepts such as ideologies and political views that are deeply influenced by culture , as well as social groups associated with “ disgusting ” concepts , says Moll .
The Nature article points out that disgust could thus facilitate cohesion within groups by defending against out - groups .
Disgust works for the group as it does for the individual - what is in the group is “ me ” and what is not is “ not me , ” says Haidt .
“ Where core disgust is the guardian of the body , moral disgust acts as the guardian of social body - that ’s when disgust shows its ugliest side .
Fiske points to the experimental data to remind us to think twice before relying on disgust as the basis for moral judgment :
History seems to bear this out .
Women ( especially menstruating ones ) , the mentally and physically disabled , and interracial sex have all been viewed with disgust , and are still viewed as such by some .
But few people in liberal societies today would defend such attitudes and many have genuinely ceased to feel them .
If disgust was n’t a good moral indicator then , why should it be now ?
The challenge , then , is to remind people that their feelings of disgust have too often led to persecution and injustice in the past , and these same gut feelings might be leading to comparable injustices in the present .
There is another challenge , as well .
Disgust is not the only basis for determining what is moral .
Haidt has written persuasively on this topic , finding that morality relies upon up to five criteria : harm , fairness , loyalty , authority and purity ( disgust ) .
How much influence should disgust play among these other criteria for what is moral , especially given that disgust has proven to be an unreliable moral indicator in the past ?
Based on the evidence presented in this post , disgust should be kept on a short leash .
Consider also that disgust is arguably a more primitive and less intellectual a factor than , for instance , fairness / justice .
Further consider that a recognition that something is disgusting often becomes salient to the point that it overwhelms all other considerations .
For many people , especially conservatives , disgust trumps all other factors because disgust is hard to ignore on a visceral level ( I was going to write that disgust is “ a bright and shiny thing , ” but disgust is actually salient in the opposite sense , in a disgusting way ) .
Once disgust gets its foot in the door for many conservatives , the process of moral judgment is essentially over .
All that needs to be done is to employ the intellect to concoct something , anything , to spiff up one ’s reliance on disgust .
Letting one ’s intellect play the role of one ’s attorney ( as we all commonly do ) , all you need to say is something like “ We oppose gay unions because we need to defend marriage . ”
Much is at stake regarding the role disgust should play in moral decision - making .
Should we allow disgust a full place at the table when we render moral judgment ?
There are grave risks to doing this .
Here ’s one example .
Assume that we are attacked by a country that has customs we deem repugnant .
Assume further that we allow our disgust ( regarding those foreign cultural traditions ) to run rampant in our moral / political thinking .
Assume that we decide to exact our revenge by attacking a country that reminds us of the country that attacked us , because that they have similar traditions — we are disgusted by the traditions of both .
Again , our minds are clever lawyers , and we love to put them to work to spin rationalizations .
Ultimately , we announce that we are “ searching for weapons of mass destruction ” or that we are “ bringing democracy ” to the country we attack .
But what if the impulse to attack the “ innocent ” country ( OK , I ’ll say it – – Iraq ) was based upon our disgust and repulsion at a group of people we considered to be an out - group ?
What if disgust was allowed to drive that decision ?
All it took was prejudice plus an intellect enslaved by human emotions .
Why am I convinced that prejudice drove the decision to invade Iraq ?
Just listen to the apologists say things like “ We ca n’t let them get away with 9/11 ″ or “ We ’ve got to stop them over there so they ca n’t get us over here . ”
They ?
Them ?
An obvious conflation of blends the 9/11 attackers with people from Iraq , with whom they have nothing in common , other than the way that Americans think that Middle Eastern cultures are all the same .
How often is the human intellect enslaved by the emotions ?
According to David Hume , always :
Reason is , and ought only to be the slave of the passions , and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them .
I am in the process of reading additional work by Jonathan Haidt , on which I will be commenting in the coming days .
I am finding his analysis exciting in that it offers a fruitful approach for studying the utterly frustrating and commonplace experience whereby liberals and conservatives talk past one another on the topic of morality .
For years , the appendix got no respect .
Doctors regarded it as nothing but a source of trouble :
It did n’t seem to do anything , and it sometimes got infected and required an emergency removal .
Plus , nobody ever suffered from not having an appendix .
So human biologists assumed that the tiny , worm - shaped organ is vestigial  a shrunken remainder of some organ our ancestors required .
In a word : Useless .
Now that old theory has been upended .
In a December issue of The Journal of Theoretical Biology , a group of scientists announce they have solved the riddle of the appendix .
The organ , they claim , is in reality a “ safe house ” for healthful bacteria  the stuff that makes our digestive system function .
When our gut is ravaged by diseases like diarrhea and dysentery , the appendix quietly goes to work repopulating the gut with beneficial bacteria .
“ In essence , ” says William Parker , a chemist who co-wrote the paper , “ after our system crashes , the appendix reboots it . ”
The theory may explain the location of the appendix : Positioned at the beginning of the colon , it often escapes being voided when a sick colon violently empties itself out the bottom .
If the appendix is indeed crucial , why do n’t people who have their appendixes removed die ?
Because in the modern world hygiene and medicine can keep our levels of healthy bacteria adequate .
The appendix may have evolved its rebooting function back when our ancestors lived a more vulnerable life  and an entire village might suffer catastrophic diarrhea .
In that situation , each gut had to rely on its own resources to recover after a collapse , so the appendix was crucial .
Nokia Opens Its First Major Retail Store In Mainland China
The Shanghai facility is equipped with a state - of - the - art audio and video system , including display screens that help visitors identify different areas of the store .
No . 1 mobile device maker Nokia on Friday opened its first flagship store in Mainland China , which is also the largest and only standalone Nokia store in the world .
Nokia claims the store , located in Shanghai , brings a new perspective to the mobile retail industry through a personalized shopping experience .
" The China market has become the leading global market in terms of scale and maturity , and we believe that the Nokia Shanghai Flagship store will become popular among Chinese consumers , " said Colin Giles , president of Nokia China , in a statement .
Store visitors can interact and become familiar with Nokia 's mobile devices and service before purchasing them .
The store is equipped with a state - of - the - art audio and video system , including display screens that help visitors identify different areas of the store .
Product descriptions appear on a nearby digital display when a visitor picks up a product to view .
All of Nokia 's products are connected to the store 's network and linked to the appropriate accessories , including wireless speakers , headsets , and printers .
The flagship stores reflect Nokia 's business - to - consumer sales model , which helps Nokia better understand consumer needs , the company said .
But Nokia is n't the only company to use this model .
Apple , among other vendors , has put up stores in different cities across the United States , where visitors can test out products and talk to sales reps in person , and existing customers can get technical support right in the store .
Apple last May opened a mega store on New York 's Fifth Avenue , which the company calls its " most architecturally innovative store . "
The store 's facade is a 32 - foot glass cube , and it 's open 24 hours a day , 365 days a year .
Nokia 's Shanghai flagship store is the seventh of 18 planned flagship stores and second in the region .
Nokia opened its first Asia Pacific store in Hong Kong last July .
Nokia also has two stores in the United States , in New York and Chicago .

Obama : Bill Clinton campaigning behavior ' troubling ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday January 21 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Barack Obama hit back Monday morning against a barrage of attacks launched by former President Bill Clinton .
The upstart presidential candidate and Illinois senator said Clinton 's " troubling " statements on behalf of his wife 's candidacy inaccurately characterized Obama 's positions , and he said the former president 's distortions are not in line with the obligation to honesty he has as a onetime occupant of the Oval Office .
" The former president , who we all have a lot of regard for , has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a level that is pretty troubling , " Obama charged Monday on ABC 's Good Morning America .
" He continues to make statements that are n't supported by the facts . "
Hillary Clinton delivered Obama a tough blow in Nevada 's caucuses on Saturday when she received about 51 percent of the popular vote and was largely declared the winner , although Obama actually received more delegates to the Democratic National Convention because of the state 's caucus rules .
Prior to the vote a teachers ' union largely populated by Clinton supporters tried to block members of the state 's Culinary Workers Union , which backed Obama , from voting in at - large precincts in Las Vegas 's massive casino resorts , where many union members work .
The campaign denied involvment in the lawsuit , but Bill Clinton accused the Culinary union of trying to prevent its members from caucusing if they indicated they would support Hillary Clinton .
Obama says the former president also distorted his record of opposition to the war in Iraq and his comments expressing some regard for former President Ronald Reagan .
For its part , Hillary Clinton 's campaign released a statement dismissing Obama 's complaints , saying he simply is " frustrated " at losing New Hampshire and defending Bill Clinton 's assertions as " facts . "
" I do think that there should be some standards of honesty in any political discourse .
That 's part of the change I want to bring about , " Obama said .
" If you have something that just directly contradicts the facts , and it 's coming from a former president , I think that 's a problem because people presume that a former president 's going to have more credibility and I think there are certain responsibilities that are carried with that . "
Barack Obama talked with Robin Robers on Good Morning America .
This video is from ABC's Good Morning America , broadcast January 21 , 2008 .
Four years ago today , letters containing anthrax were postmarked from Trenton , N.J. , to five major American media outlets , including ABC News , NBC News , CBS News , the New York Post , and AMI Media , a publisher of supermarket tabloids .
Thus began a series of attacks over several weeks that terrorized the nation , infected 22 people , killed five  and played a key role in amplifying the post - 9/11 hysteria and paranoia that took the nation on a course set for war .
Three weeks after the first mailings , two letters containing highly weaponized anthrax  far more deadly than the relatively crude concoction contained in the first letters  showed up in the offices of two Democratic senators , Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy .
The Capitol emptied , most members of Congress fled Washington , and the country  already jumpy as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks  was practically prostrate with fear .
Remember how the War Party used these attacks to stoke up sentiment for attacking Iraq ?
Andrew Sullivan declared :
“ At this point , it seems to me that a refusal to extend the war to Iraq is not even an option .
We have to extend it to Iraq .
It is by far the most likely source of this weapon ; it is clearly willing to use such weapons in the future ; and no war against terrorism of this kind can be won without dealing decisively with the Iraqi threat .
We no longer have any choice in the matter .
Slowly , incrementally , a Rubicon has been crossed .
The terrorists have launched a biological weapon against the United States .
They have therefore made biological warfare thinkable and thus repeatable .
We once had a doctrine that such a Rubicon would be answered with a nuclear response .
We backed down on that threat in the Gulf War but Saddam did n’t dare use biological weapons then .
Someone has dared to use them now .
Our response must be as grave as this new threat . “
Nuke ’em ! , said Andy  without a single iota of evidence that Iraq was involved .
But who needs evidence ?
That ’s soooo September 10th .
Everything ’s changed , we were told : we do n’t require evidence , not anymore .
All we need are vaguely portentous phrases , such as “ a Rubicon has been crossed . ”
We can make up the rest as we go along
Over at the Weekly Standard , Bill Kristol was gleefully rubbing his hands together and cackling that the administration seemed finally to have signed on to the neocon prescription for taking the “ war on terrorism ” beyond Afghanistan , to Iraq :
“ Has the administration come around thanks to repeated efforts at persuasion by The Weekly Standard ( and a few other hawks ) ?
Perhaps .
But a likelier explanation is that they have come to believe we ’ll have to take the war beyond Afghanistan  to Iraq and other state sponsors of terror  because they ’ve found evidence of support by ‘ other states ’ for very recent and sinister bin Laden - related activities .
“ What if the anthrax cases in Florida are an act of terrorism ?
What if the presence of the anthrax spores there is connected to the fact that a few of the September 11 terrorists , led by Mohammed Atta , lived within a few miles ?
What if Atta  or some other bin Laden operative  had access to anthrax from the terrorist - sponsoring country that we know has a long record of developing anthrax as a biological weapon , Iraq ? ”
Unlike the more emotive Sullivan  for whom evidence of an Iraq connection would only be an unnecessary drag on his breathy imprecations  the cool - headed Kristol came up with a scenario meant to convince the reader that such a connection was at least possible .
It involved the now famous  and decidedly disproved  meeting between Mohammed Atta and an alleged Iraqi intelligence agent in Prague .
Although the Czech police denied it , the myth persisted , and grew : not only did Atta plan the 9/11 terrorist attacks in collaboration with Iraqi intelligence on his trip to Prague , he also  according to Kristol and James “ World War IV ” Woolsey  hatched the anthrax plot .
However , given that this mythical meeting , conducted in the course of six busy hours , was alleged to have taken place at the Prague airport , and was conducted within range of security cameras , one wonders if passing vials of anthrax under such circumstances might have proven somewhat problematic .
Oh well , the War Party did n’t need especially logical arguments in stoking the fires of American rage : the smoke had yet to lift from downtown Manhattan , and the victims of the Twin Towers and Pentagon attacks were still being counted .
As anthrax panic gripped the nation , the White House was preparing to extend the war to “ other countries ”  a prospect Kristol & Co. found thrilling .
If the administration would n’t bow to the bellicose blandishments of the Weekly Standard , then perhaps they would bend before the amplified fear of terrorism raised by the anthrax attacks .
And so they did .
In retrospect , outrage and fear generated by the anthrax attacks were essential elements of the propaganda campaign designed to link Iraq to terrorism in the U.S. and drag us into war .
The attacks were so propitious in this regard that one might be forgiven for wondering if the perpetrators had this as their intention .
Certainly they took great pains to convey the impression that the postal pestilence was authored by angry Arabs of one sort or another .
Also , in retrospect , the investigation into the anthrax mystery seems remarkably botched , a kind of pre-Katrina premonition of a dangerous  even criminal  incompetence .
The authorities quickly seized on one Steven J. Hatfill , a government scientist and a somewhat hapless figure , against whom not a single shred of solid evidence could be marshaled .
Yet Hatfill was branded a “ person of interest ” and relentlessly harassed by government agents , who  in collaboration with a certain New York Times columnist  destroyed his reputation .
U.S. government agents followed him everywhere , made his life a misery , and refuse to this day to either apologize or offer some small compensation to a man whose life they have ruined .
It is interesting that the U.S. government was all too eager to follow the path suggested by journalists such as Nicholas Kristof , one of Hatfill ’s earliest and most relentless nemeses , while studiously ignoring the clues provided by others .
The Hartford Courant ran a series of articles by Dave Altimari , Lynne Tuohy , and Jack Dolan that not only pointed in the direction of the possible perpetrators , but named names and implied a political - ideological motive behind the crime .
The anthrax strain has been positively identified as being of the Ames variety , of the sort stored at USAMRIID , the U.S. government biological weapons facility at Fort Detrick , Md. , and a few other such labs .
Soon after the anthrax attacks , the Courant exposed the weird problems besetting the Ft. Detrick facility , which had apparently been missing large quantities of biological toxins , including not only anthrax but also hanta virus , Ebola virus , and other lethal pathogens .
These mysterious disappearances apparently occurred :
“ During a turbulent period of labor complaints and recriminations among rival scientists there , documents from an internal Army inquiry show .
The 1992 inquiry also found evidence that someone was secretly entering a lab late at night to conduct unauthorized research , apparently involving anthrax .
A numerical counter on a piece of lab equipment had been rolled back to hide work done by the mystery researcher , who left the misspelled label ‘ antrax ’ in the machine ’s electronic memory , according to the documents obtained by The Courant . ”
This “ mystery researcher ” may have been someone at the very center of that “ turbulent period , ” one Philip Zack .
Zack and a group of personnel at Ft. Detrick had been systematically harassing an Egyptian co-worker , Dr. Ayaad Assaad .
The Courant reports :
“ Documents from the inquiry show that one unauthorized person who was observed entering the lab building at night was Langford ’s predecessor , Lt. Col .
Philip Zack , who at the time no longer worked at Fort Detrick .
A surveillance camera recorded Zack being let in at 8:40 p.m. on Jan. 23 , 1992 , apparently by Dr. Marian Rippy , a lab pathologist and close friend of Zack ’s , according to a report filed by a security guard . ”
The harassment of Assaad , detailed here , took on bizarrely juvenile forms : an obscene poem , a rubber camel delivered to his mailbox , a constant stream of racist anti-Arab remarks such as one might find posted these days on Little Green Footballs .
Court documents reveal a harrowing experience of cruel and relentless persecution carried out by a small clique , including Zack , who called themselves the “ camel club . ”
While the anthrax letters received enormous publicity , one mailed missive that might provide a key clue to the identity of the perpetrators has received very little : an anonymous letter , sent in late September before the anthrax drama unfolded , to the military police at the Marine base in Quantico , Va. , accused Dr. Assaad of being behind a terrorist plot to unleash biological horrors in American cities .
The author revealed a detailed knowledge of Dr. Assaad ’s career at USAMRIID and claimed to have formerly worked with him .
Assaad was interrogated by the FBI on Oct. 3 , then let go after the letter was determined to be a hoax .
When the effects of the anthrax attacks began to make themselves known , the full horror of what had happened began to dawn on Assaad  but not , apparently , on the authorities .
Says Assaad : “ My theory is , whoever this person is knew in advance what was going to happen ( and created ) a suitable , well - fitted scapegoat for this action . ”
The odd timing of the letter  sent after the anthrax letters were mailed , but before their deadly contents were known  certainly seems to point in this direction .
The Courant reports FBI spokesman Chris Murray saying “ the FBI is not tracking the source of the anonymous letter , despite its curious timing , coming a matter of days before the existence of anthrax - laced mail became known . ”
Instead of following the trail of this important clue , investigators went off on a tangent with the Hatfill angle , which proved [ . pdf ] to be a dead end .
An Egyptian scientist , albeit one who is an American citizen and had lived in this country for quite some time , had been set up as the scapegoat for the crime  before knowledge of the mailed anthrax was generally known .
This same scientist had been the object of a hate campaign generated by virulently anti-Arab co-workers at Ft. Detrick , at least one of whom was videotaped surreptitiously entering the lab at night ( after he had been dismissed from his position and was not authorized to enter in any event ) .
Whoever wrote the poison pen letter denouncing Dr. Assaad as a potential terrorist in all likelihood knows something about the origins of the anthrax attack .
In this context , the crudeness of the messages accompanying the anthrax  “ death to America ” and “ death to Israel ”  seems like an obvious effort to divert attention away from the real authors of a crime that goes unsolved to this day .
Just as the Bush administration was looking for an excuse  any excuse  to take out after Iraq , the anthrax horror reared its head and silenced any remaining opposition to the war plans of this administration , at least momentarily .
It all seems like such a terribly convenient coincidence .
In retrospect , it was as much a part of the vortex of fearmongering that sucked us into war as tales of Iraqi WMD palmed off by Ahmed Chalabi‘s “ heroes in error ” and the extravagant effusions of Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice .
No , I am not suggesting that the U.S. government or the Bush administration carried out these attacks : yet whoever did surely had in mind making it easier for the War Party to unleash mass death and destruction in the Middle East , a veritable wave of hate that would carry us to Baghdad and beyond .
Why is n’t Congress investigating this ?
Where is the probe into the “ intelligence failure ” that managed to target and destroy an innocent person while pulling investigators away from evidence pointing in a more plausible direction ?
Whoever pulled off the anthrax attacks is still out there , waiting for the right moment to strike .
This is a case that must be solved  because there ’s more where that came from .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
The Huffington Post reports Dr. Zalmay Khalilzad , our ambassador to Iraq , predicted U.S. troops will enter Syria  ostensibly in “ pursuit ” of “ terrorists ”  in private remarks at Republican tycoon Teddy Forstmann ‘s annual “ off the record ” Aspen conclave of Movers and Shakers .
Just remember , you read it here first .
UN conferences are usually quite boring , which is why many who may otherwise lack admiration for Hugo Chavez found considerable entertainment value in the Venezuelan Bolivar ’s remarks , to wit :
“ The only place where a person can ask for another head of state to be assassinated is the United States , which is what happened recently with the Reverend Pat Robertson , a very close friend of the White House .
He publicly asked for my assassination and he ’s still walking the streets . ”
While I ca n’t agree that the Rev. Robertson should be cooling his heels and his evangelical fervor behind bars , I have to say that these distinctly un-Christian sentiments seem to reflect a general trend on the right side of the political spectrum toward outright thuggery .
A good example is the recent death threat against myself , Howard Zinn , Noam Chomsky , Michael Moore , and other opponents of the war published by David Horowitz ’s Frontpagemag.com ( whole story detailed here ) .
To follow up : my column on this subject generated a wave of protest directed at the author of the threat , one Michael Lopez - Calderon , a high school teacher of history at Rockville High School in Maryland .
He recently sent out this appeal ( now behind a “ privacy screen ” ) , which reads in part :
“ Subject : Calderon urgently needs your help !
“ Because of a deluge of emails , phones , and faxes from around the country , the School Board is running scared .
I was placed on paid leave Thursday , September 8 , 2005 at 12:25 PM .
“ I am under investigation by the Board .
What will they find ?
Nothing to substantiate any claims that I have been anything but an exemplary teacher with superb evaluations , with not a single parental or student complaint levelled [ sic ] against me ; you guys know who I am .
“ Guys this is not bullshit my career , my reputation , and my health are ON THE LINE .
PLEASE HELP ME ! ”
Pathetic , sad , and funny all at once .
Pathetic because an adult human being  and one who is furthermore charged with instructing and serving as a role model for children  is refusing to recognize that rash actions often have unfortunate  and costly  consequences .
Sad because , from the contents of Calderon ’s own weblog , it is clear that he regarded his job , and the subsequent uptick in his income , as a source of pride and satisfaction .
Funny  if you like your humor dark  because there is not one mention of Calderon ’s plight on Frontpage .
David Horowitz , the great defender of “ free speech ” for conservatives in academia , is refusing to defend one of his own crazed minions : he has n’t even published Calderon ’s appeal , and I have seen no new blog items from the man who fantasized that one day “ leftist professors will be strung up . ”
Perhaps Horowitz is unwilling to defend someone who makes the Horowitzian action plan so vividly explicit .
In any case , Horowitz has left poor deluded Calderon twisting in the wind  and is n’t that just like a neocon ?
Calderon wails that I ’m violating his First Amendment rights , but I plead not guilty to the charge .
I have no desire to prevent him from exercising his right to engage in free speech  he can issue death threats till the cows come home , for all I care  but I have the same First Amendment right , which I choose to exercise by calling attention to his incitements .
It works both ways .
Let the red - state fascists bellow and posture to their heart ’s content , because the louder their unseemly threats , the more they discredit themselves and their cause .
That Horowitz , who has the biggest , loudest mouth of them all , is beginning to appreciate this , however dimly , is evidenced perhaps by his deafening silence on the Calderon matter .
I also have to say that Calderon has issued an apology , of sorts , albeit one that goes on to assert his loyalty to the red -state fascist mindset that unconsciously plagiarized the spirit if not the letter of The Turner Diaries :
“ That said , let me state that I will stick to my position which holds those that Americans , e.g. , the convicted radical lawyer Lynne Stewart , who openly aid and abet our enemies during a time when our home and hearth have been attacked and face additional attacks , should suffer the wrath of a Federal Government empowered under a revived and robust Sedition Act .
That revived Sedition
Act should be used only under the most extreme set of circumstances , and an America devastated by a WMD delivered by terrorists fits that description . ”
Oh , I see : he does n’t want to kill me and the other devil - figures in his demonology of prominent “ seditionists . ”
He just wants to jail us .
To the red - state fascists who have taken over the official “ conservative ” movement , this really is an “ apology ” !
These people are scary , but Horowitz ’s behavior has been particularly reprehensible .
Unlike Calderon , he has not apologized for publishing the death threat .
Worse yet , to date he has so far failed to publicly defend one of his own writers from serious charges .
Calderon may be fired from his job and suffer a significant financial and career setback as a result of remarks posted on Horowitz ’s own Web site , and presumably authorized by Horowitz himself or one of his employees .
Horowitz , however , takes no responsibility , offers no apology , and goes about his business of smearing the antiwar movement and anyone who opposes the Regime as if nothing is amiss .
On this matter we get from him something we do n’t often get to enjoy : complete silence .
A true rarity , to be sure .
But how long can it last ?

Explanation :
What would it look like to fly past Mercury ?
Just such an adventure was experienced last week by the MESSENGER spacecraft during its first flyby of the strange moon - like world nearest the Sun .
Pictured above is the limb of Mercury seen by MESSENGER upon approach , from about 1 1/2 Earth diameters away .
Visible on the hot and barren planet are many craters , many appeared to be more shallow than similarly sized craters on the Moon .
The comparatively high gravity of Mercury helps flatten tall structures like high crater walls .
MESSENGER was able to take over 1,000 images of Mercury which will be beamed back to Earth for planetary geologists to study .
The robotic MESSENGER spacecraft is scheduled to fly past Mercury twice more before firing its thrusters to enter orbit in 2011 .

The walls are festooned like bulletin boards with sheaves of newspaper pages and cutouts and reams of wire releases ( there are two wire machines in a corner ) .
Large blowups of HOWARD BEALE are prominently displayed .
There are small , shelved libraries of books , directories and magazines here and there .
And the ever - present bank of four television monitors ; and , Since it is 10:30 A.M. , Tuesday , September 23 , 1975 , and , since the AUDIO is OFF , the screens silently flicker with whatever was on that day at that time .

Then abruptly the SCREEN is filled with Vice President designate Nelson Rockefeller testifying before the Senate Rules Committee -- MAX ( shouting into phone ) Black it out !
The SCREEN abruptly goes into BLACK as MAX slashes his phone back into its cradle .
His PHONE promptly RINGS again , but MAX is already headed for the door .
The SCREEN goes into STANDBY .
His SQUAWK BOX suddenly blares -- SQUAWK BOX
What the hell happened , Max ? -- MAX ( shouting as he exits )
How the hell do I know ?
I 'm going down now !
He strides into -- 14 . INT .
ROOM 509 - COMMON ROOM OF NEWS EXECUTIVE OFFICES

It is empty now except for one SECRETARY just now putting the cover on her typewriter .
MAX strides through and exits into -- 15 .
INT .
FIFTH FLOOR CORRIDOR
A long institutional corridor -- part of an endless maze of similar corridors -- with offices and technical rooms debouching on both sides .
The corridor has begun to fill up with video - tape OPERATORS and other News Division PERSONNEL who happen to be working late -- all of whom are either wondering what happened or are telling others what happened .
MAX yanks an exit door open and disappears down a flight of steps to emerge into -- 16 .
INT .
FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR -- which leads directly to the doors for the control room and for the studio .
Coming out of the control room is the TECHNICAL DIRECTOR , who , on spotting MAX striding down the corridor to him , says -- TECHNICAL DIRECTOR Jesus Christ , Mr. Schumacher ! --
He follows MAX into the -- 17 .

STUDIO
Everything seems to have quieted a bit , the hysteria down to mumbles and murmurs and occasional sounds of laughter .
TELEPHONES are shrilly and incessantly RINGING .
In the far corner of the studio sits HOWARD BEALE surrounded by HARRY HUNTER , the DIRECTOR , the ASSOCIATE PRODUCER , the PRODUCTION ASSISTANT , and the FLOOR MANAGER .
CAMERAMEN , GRIPS and other FLOOR PERSONNEL are gathered in a FLUX of little clumps around the studio murmuring and muttering and giggling over the whole absurd episode MAX heads straight for the GROUP around HOWARD .
They part to let him in -- HARRY HUNTER ( to MAX ) Tom Cabell wants you to call as soon as you come in -- MAX nods , stares at HOWARD -- VOICE ( O.S. )
Harry !
Joe Sweeney on the phone !
-- HARRY HUNTER ( bawls back )
I 'm not taking any more calls !
Tell them Mr. Schumacher 's here !
They can talk to him !
MAX ( staring at HOWARD )
Howard , you have got to be out of your ever - loving mind .
Are you drunk ?
( to the others )
How much boozing has he been doing today ?
PHONES O.S. RING and RING .
VOICES O.S. SHOUT -- VOICES ( O.S. ) -- Mr. Schumacher , Mr. Cabell on the phone ! -- -- Mr. Schumacher !

He suddenly smiles broadly at MAX and winks .
VOICES ( O.S. ) --

FRANK HACKETT , Executive Senior Vice President of the network , 41 years old , one of the new cool young breed of management / merchandising executives , wearing a tuxedo -- ( he had been pulled out of a dinner party in Westchester by this unfortunate business ) -- comes out of the elevator and turns briskly into -- 19 .
INT .
FIFTH FLOOR CORRIDOR -- which is clotted with network EXECUTIVES of assorted sizes and ages .
HACKETT , en route to Room 509 , which is clearly the humming hub of activity up here , pauses to comment to one of the EXECUTIVES -- HACKETT Lou , ca n't we clear out that downstairs lobby ?
There must be a hundred people down there , every TV station and wire service in the city .

The VP Sales ( JOE DONNELLY ) is just taking the phone from the VP News Sales ( RICHMOND KETTERING ) who is seated at the desk of the secretary for VP Public Relations News Division -- DONNELLY ( on phone ) -- how many spots were wiped out ?
-- HACKETT ( to GIANINI , who is seated at another secretary 's desk studying a typescript of the aborted news show )
Anything litigable ?
-- GIANINI
Not so far -- DONNELLY ( on phone ) --
We had to abort the show .
Ed , what else could we do ?
We 'll make good , do n't worry about it -- HACKETT ( to ARTHUR ZANGWILL , VP Standards and Practices , now coming out of MAX 's office ) Is Nelson in there ?
ZANGWILL
He 's talking to Wheeler .
So far , over nine hundred fucking phone calls complaining about the foul language -- HACKETT ( mutters ) Shit -- P.R. MAN ( in b.g. on phone ) -- come on , Mickey , what page are you putting it on ?!

MAN sticks his head into the office P.R. MAN ( calling to STEINMAN ) ABC again , wants the tape -- STEINMAN
Tell him to go fuck himself ( to phone )
And that goes for you too , Marty -- HACKETT ( to HOWARD BEALE , sitting on the couch )
You 're off the air as of now .
CHANEY ( extending his phone to HACKETT )
He wants to talk to you -- HACKETT ( to MAX , leaning against a wall )
Who 's replacing Beale tomorrow ?
MAX
We 're flying up Snowden from Washington .
STEINMAN ( leaning across HACKETT to turn up the volume knob on Max 's desk )
All right , everybody hold it .
Let 's see how the other networks handled this --
He is referring to the four television monitors -- three on the wall and a large office console monitor of UBS - TV , now blurting out their respective commercials -- THACKERAY ( VP Stations Relations , lounging in the doorway )
The ten o'clock news opened with it -- HACKETT ( on phone ) Walter 's drafted a statement , I have n't seen it yet -- I just got here , John , I was at a dinner party -- Suddenly , the faces of DAVE MARASH and ROLAND SMITH and CHUCK SCARBOROUGH and ROGER GRIMSBY and BILL BEUTEL and the UBS local news anchorman , TIM HALLOWAY , are on the screen .
Affable DAVE MARASH on the CBS monitor is saying : MARASH ( affably )
An unusual thing happened at one of our sister networks , UBS , this evening -- ROGER GRIMSBY ( almost simultaneously ) Howard Beale , one of television 's most esteemed newscasters -- CHUCK SCARBOROUGH
Howard Beale interrupted his network news program tonight to announce -- HACKETT ( mutters ) Shit -- TIM HALLOWAY Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made a forceful address before the United Nations General Assembly -- HACKETT ( to MAX )
How are we handling it ?
MAX Halloway 's going to make a brief statement at the end of the show to the effect Howard 's been under great personal stress , et cetera HACKETT reaches to click off the bank of monitor screens .
They abruptly go black .
HACKETT ( on phone ) I 'll call you back , John .
( returns the phone to its cradle , regards the gathered EXECUTIVES )
All right .
We 've got a stockholders ' meeting tomorrow at which we 're going to announce the restructuring of management plan , and I do n't want this grotesque incident to interfere with that .
I 'll suggest Mr. Ruddy open with a short statement washing this whole thing off , and , you , Max , better have some answers in case some of those nuts that always come to stockholders ' meetings -- MAX ( back to leaning against the wall ) Mr. Beale has been under great personal and professional pressures -- HACKETT ( exploding )
I 've got some goddam surprises for you too , Schumacher !
I 've had it up to here with your cruddy division and its annual thirty - three million dollar deficit !
-- MAX
Keep your hands off my news division Frank .
We 're responsible to corporate level , not to you .
HACKETT
We 'll goddam well see about that !
CHANEY
All right , take it easy .
Right now , how ' re we going to get Beale out of here ?
I understand there 's at least a hundred reporters and camera crews ings -- HERRON ( buzzing the projectionist ) Diana asked if she could sit in on this -- MAX Fine -- ( sits , calls to DIANA ) How 's it going ?
DIANA shrugs , smiles .
The lights in the room go down .
A shaft of light shoots out from the projection room .
The PHONE at MAX 's elbow BUZZES .
HE picks it up -- MAX ( murmurs into phone ) Max Schumacher -- I 'm glad I got you , John .
Listen , I got into a hassle with Frank Hackett last night over the Howard Beale thing , and he made a crack about the stockholders ' meeting this afternoon .
He said something about having some surprises for me .
Is there something going on , John , I do n't know about ? ...
John , I 'm counting on you and Mr. Ruddy to back me up against that son of a bitch Okay , see you this afternoon --
He hangs up , leans back , watches the documentary film which has just begun .
ON SCREEN , a handsome black woman in her early 30's -- MAX
Who 's that , Laureen Hobbs ?
HERRON Yeah . -- is sitting in a typical panel discussion grouping , flanked by three MEN and a WOMAN , two white , two black , all very urban guerilla , in fatigues , sun glasses and combat boots .
MISS HOBBS looks calmly into camera and says : LAUREEN HOBBS ( ON SCREEN )
The Communist Party believes that the most pressing political necessity today is the consolidation of the revolutionary , radical and democratic movements into a United Front -- The PHONE BUZZES softly .
MAX picks it up -- MAX ( murmurs into phone ) Yeah ? ...
Oh , goddamit , when , Louise ?
Well , did he say anything ?
...
All right , thanks .
( hangs up , promptly picks up again ) Four - eight - oh - seven -- LAUREEN HOBBS ( ON SCREEN ) ( in b.g. )
Repression is the response of an increasingly desperate , imperialist ruling clique .
Indeed , the entire apparatus of the bourgeois - democratic state especially its judicial systems and its prisons is disintegrating -- MAX ( on phone ) Harry , Howard left my house about ten minutes ago presumably headed here .
Let me know as soon as he gets here .
LAUREEN HOBBS ( ON SCREEN ) ( in b.g. )
The fascist thrust must be resisted in its incipient stages by the broadest possible coalition -- 25 .
INT .
SCREENING ROOM 7 - TWENTY MINUTES LATER
Room still dark .
ON SCREEN , NUMBERED WHITE LEADER is rolling down -- HERRON
What we 're going to see now is something really sensational .
The Flagstaff Independent Bank in Arizona was ripped off last week by a terrorist group called the Ecumenical Liberation Army , and they themselves actually took movies of the rip - off while they were ripping it off .
It 's in black and white , but wait 'll you see it --
The SCREEN suddenly erupts into film of the interior of a bank being entered in the wake of THREE MEN , two of them black , and TWO WOMEN , one black and one white .
They disperse to various parts of the bank as if they were here on legitimate business -- DIANA The Ecumenical Liberation Army -- is that the one that kidnapped Patty Hearst ?
HERRON
No , that 's the Symbionese Liberation Army .
This is the Ecumenical Liberation Army .
They 're the ones who kidnapped Mary Ann Gifford three weeks ago .
There 's a hell of a lot of liberation armies in the revolutionary underground and a lot of kidnapped heiresses .
That 's Mary Ann Gifford --
This last in reference to the young white woman on screen who is lugging a shopping bag as she joins a line at a teller 's window -- DIANA
You mean , they actually shot this film while they were ripping off the bank ?
HERRON
Yeah , wait 'll you see it .
I do n't know whether to edit or leave it raw like this .
That 's the Great Ahmed Khan ; he 's the leader -- ON SCREEN , the film has gone out of focus a couple of times and bounced meaninglessly around the bank and finally settled on a large , powerful black man at one of the desks , presumably writing out a series of deposit slips -- DIANA
This is terrific stuff .
Where did you get it ?
HERRON I got everything through Laureen Hobbs .
She 's my contact for all this stuff .
DIANA I thought she was straight Communist Party .
HERRON Right .
But she 's trying to unify all the factions in the underground , so she knows everybody .
ON SCREEN , the CAMERA has whooshed amateurishly about , unfocuses and focuses again to pick up MARY ANN GIFFORD bending over her shopping bag and pulling out a Czech service submachine gun 9 Parabellum which she points to the ceiling and apparently fires ; the FILM is silent , but the reactions of everyone around suggest clearly something was fired .
The FILM gets fragmented and panicky about here , as does the activity in the bank .
The PHONE at MAX 's elbow BUZZES .

He sits behind his desk , fits a piece of paper into the machine and then , again , suddenly , he makes a strange little GROWL -- 33 .

NIGHTLY NEWS ROOM Our PRODUCTION ASSISTANT , remembered perhaps from the control room scene , passes HOWARD 's open door and is given pause by the strange little noises coming from HOWARD 's office .
She stands in the doorway a moment watching HOWARD GRUNTING , GROWLING and SNARLING as he CLACKS away at the typewriter -- PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
You all right , Mr. Beale ?

An occasional PHONE RINGS .

The office is executive - size , windows looking out on the canyons of glass and stone skyscrapers on Sixth Avenue , desk piled high with scripts .
GEORGE BOSCH ( VP Program Development East Coast ) , a slight , balding man of 39 , enters the office , nods to HERRON , takes a seat ; and is immediately followed by BARBARA SCHLESINGER ( Head of the Story Department ) , the chunky lady just called in by DIANA , and TOMMY PELLEGRINO ( Assistant VP Programs ) , 36 , swarthy , coifed and mustachioed .
They find seats on the chairs , the small couch .
HERRON remains standing -- DIANA ( introducing )
This is Bill Herron from our West Coast Special Programs Department -- Barbara Schlesinger -- George Bosch -- Tommy Pellegrino --
Look , I just saw some rough footage of a special Bill 's doing on the revolutionary underground .
Most of it 's tedious stuff of Laureen Hobbs and four fatigue jackets muttering mutilated Marxism .
But he 's got about eight minutes of a bank robbery that is absolutely sensational .
Authentic stuff .
Actually shot while the robbery was going on .
Remember the Mary Ann Gifford kidnapping ?
Well , it 's that bunch of nuts .
She 's in the film shooting off machine guns .
Really terrific footage .
I think we can get a hell of a movie of the week out of it , maybe even a series .
PELLEGRINO
A series out of what ?
What 're we talking about ?
DIANA Look , we 've got a bunch of hobgoblin radicals called the Ecumenical Liberation Army who go around taking home movies of themselves robbing banks .
Maybe they 'll take movies of themselves kidnapping heiresses , hijacking 747's , bombing bridges , assassinating ambassadors .
We 'd open each week 's segment with that authentic footage , hire a couple of writers to write some story behind that footage , and we 've got ourselves a series .
BOSCH
A series about a bunch of bank - robbing guerillas ?
SCHLESINGER
What 're we going to call it -- the Mao Tse Tung Hour ?
DIANA
Why not ?
They 've got Strike Force , Task Force , SWAT -- why not Che Guevara and his own little mod squad ?
Listen , I sent you all a concept analysis report yesterday .
Did any of you read it ?
( apparently not )
Well , in a nutshell , it said the American people are turning sullen .
They 've been clobbered on all sides by Vietnam , Watergate , the inflation , the depression .
They 've turned off , shot up , and they 've fucked themselves limp .
And nothing helps .
Evil still triumphs over all , Christ is a dope - dealing pimp , even sin turned out to be impotent .
The whole world seems to be going nuts and flipping off into space like an abandoned balloon .
So -- this concept analysis report concludes -- the American people want somebody to articulate their rage for them .
I 've been telling you people since I took this job six months ago that I want angry shows .
I do n't want conventional programming on this network .
I want counter - culture .
I want anti-establishment .
She closes the door .
DIANA
Now , I do n't want to play butch boss with you people .
But when I took over this department , it had the worst programming record in television history .
This network has n't one show in the top twenty .
This network is an industry joke .
We better start putting together one winner for next September .
I want a show developed , based on the activities of a terrorist group .
Joseph Stalin and his merry band of Bolsheviks .
I want ideas from you people .
And , by the way , the next time I send an audience research report around , you all better read it , or I 'll sack the fucking lot of you , is that clear ?
( apparently , it is .
She turns to HERRON ) I 'll be out on the coast in four weeks .
Can you set up a meeting with Laureen Hobbs for me ?
HERRON Sure . 40 . INT .

FRANK HACKETT , Senior Executive Vice President UBS -TV , is at the lectern making the annual report -- HACKETT ( in the droning manner of such reports ) ... but the business of management is management ; and , at the time C. C. and A. took control , the UBS - TV network was foundering with less than seven percent of national television revenues , most network programs being sold at station rates .
I am therefore pleased to announce I am submitting to the Board of Directors a plan for the coordination of the main profit centers , and with the specific intention of making each division more responsive to management -- ANOTHER ANGLE SINGLING OUT MAX SCHUMACHER in the second row of the phalanx of EXECUTIVES , bored with the proceedings , and whispering to NELSON CHANEY seated beside him .

To me , it is inconceivable such a wanton fiscal affront go unresisted -- ANOTHER ANGLE ACROSS HACKETT with a smoldering MAX SCHUMACHER in b.g. -- HACKETT --
The new plan calls for local news to be transferred to Owned Stations Divisions -- MAX in b.g. , stares angrily down his row towards NORMAN MOLDANIAN , who studiously avoids his eye -- HACKETT -- News - Radio would be transferred to the UBS Radio Division -- ACROSS MAX turning in his seat to scowl at GEORGE NICHOLS in the row behind him -- HACKETT ( in b.g. ) -- and , in effect , the News Division would be reduced -- MAX leaning forward trying to catch the eye of EDWARD RUDDY in the front row .

What was that all about , Ed? -- RUDDY ( turning to MAX , urbane )
This is not the time , Max .
MAX ( barely containing himself )
Why was n't I told about this ?
Why was I led onto that podium and publicly guillotined in front of the stockholders ?
Goddammit , I spoke to John Wheeler this morning , and he assured me the News Division was safe .
Are you trying to get me to resign ?
It 's a hell of a way to do it .

Way down at the far end of the corridor , the double doors of the corner office open , and NELSON CHANEY leans out and beckons to MAX , who starts down the plush carpeting in response -- 51 .

MR .
RUDDY'S OFFICE Large , regal .
Impressionist originals on those walls which are not glass through which the crepuscular grandeur of New York at night can be seen .
RUDDY sits behind his desk .
JOHN WHEELER , 59 , silent , forceful , lounges in one of the several leather chairs .
The door opens , and NELSON CHANEY and MAX SCHUMACHER come in .
Everybody nods at everybody else .
MAX slumps into a leather chair .
RUDDY ( murmurs to CHANEY )
I 'll want to see Mr. Beale after this .
CHANEY promptly picks up a corner phone and calls down to the Fourteenth Floor .
RUDDY ( regards MAX briefly , murmurs )
The way I hear it , Max , you 're primarily responsible for this colossally stupid prank .
Is that the fact , Max ?
MAX
That 's the fact .
RUDDY
It was unconscionable .
There does n't seem to be anything more to say .
MAX I have something to say , Ed. I 'd like to know why that whole debasement of the News Division announced at the stockholders ' meeting today was kept secret from me .
You and I go back twenty years , Ed. I took this job with your personal assurance that you would back my autonomy against any encroachment .
But ever since CCA acquired control of the UBS Systems ten months ago , Hackett 's been taking over everything .
Who the hell 's running this network , you or some conglomerate called CCA ?
I mean , you 're the Chairman of the Systems Group , and Frank Hackett 's just CCA 's hatchet man .
Nelson here -- for Pete 's sake , he 's the president of the network -- he has n't got anything to say about anything anymore .
Who the hell 's running this company , you or CCA ?
RUDDY ( murmurs ) I told you at the stockholders ' meeting , Max , that we would discuss all that at our regular meeting tomorrow morning .
If you had been patient , I would 've explained to you that I too thought Frank Hackett precipitate and that the reorgani- zation of the News Division would not be executed until everyone , specifically you , Max , had been consulted and satisfied .
Instead , you sulked off like a child and engaged this network in a shocking and disgraceful episode .
Your position here is no longer tenable regardless of how management is restructured .
I expect you to bring in your resignation at ten o'clock tomorrow morning , and we will coordinate our statements to the least detriment of everyone .
( to WHEELER ) Bob McDonough will take over the News Division till we sort all this out .
( WHEELER nods .
RUDDY turns to CHANEY still in the corner of the room on the phone ) I 'd like to see Mr. Beale now -- CHANEY ( on phone )
They 're looking for him , Ed .
They do n't know where he is -- 52 .

Also on the bed is a naked young STUD , who is n't really that interested in the 11:00 News .
He is fondling , fingering , noodling and nuzzling DIANA with the clear intention of mounting her -- HOWARD ( on TV screen ) -- just once I wanted to say what I really felt --

SECRETARY

DIANA'S OFFICE Morning SUNLIGHT blasting in .
DIANA moves to her desk , stands behind it , scanning the front pages of the newspapers piled on her desk , then sits and studies the overnight ratings also on her desk .
The SECRETARY enters with yesterday 's overnights , a sheet of paper , which she extends to DIANA , who promptly studies them .
The SECRETARY exits as BARBARA SCHLESINGER enters , sinks onto a chair with a sigh -- SCHLESINGER
These are those four outlines submitted by Universal for an hour series .
You need n't bother to read them .
I 'll tell them to you .
The first one is set in a large Eastern law school , pre- sumably Harvard .
The series is irresistibly entitled The Young Lawyers .
The running characters are a crusty but benign ex-Supreme Court Justice , presumably Oliver Wendell Holmes by way of Dr. Zorba .
There is a beautiful girl graduate student and the local district attorney who is brilliant and sometimes cuts corners -- DIANA ( studying the overnights ) Next one -- SCHLESINGER
The second one is called The Amazon Squad -- DIANA ( studying the overnights )
Lady cops ?
SCHLESINGER
The running characters are a crusty but benign police lieutenant who 's always getting heat from the Commissioner , a hard - nosed , hard - drinking detective who thinks women belong in the kitchen , and a brilliant and beautiful young girl cop fighting the feminist battle on the force -- DIANA ( now studying the front page of the Daily News )
We 're up to our ears in lady cop shows .
SCHLESINGER
The next one is another investi- gative reporter show .
A crusty but benign managing editor who 's always getting heat from the publisher -- DIANA
The Arabs have decided to jack up the price of oil another twenty per cent , and the C.I.A. has been caught opening Senator Humphrey 's mail , there 's a civil war in Angola , another one in Beirut , New York City 's facing default , they 've finally caught up with Patricia Hearst , and -- ( she flips the Daily News over so BARBARA can read it ) -- the whole front page of the Daily News is Howard Beale .

HACKETT'S OFFICE where HACKETT sits unhappily at his desk poring over memos from his Stations Relations Department and reports from his Sales Department .
HACKETT ( not bothering to look up ) KTNS Kansas City refuses to carry our network news any more unless Beale is taken off the air -- DIANA ( drops the sheet of paper on HACKETT 's desk )
Did you see the overnights on the Network News ?
It has an 8 in New York and a 9 in L.A. and a 27 share in both cities .
Last night , Howard Beale went on the air and yelled bullshit for two minutes , and I can tell you right now that tonight 's show will get a 30 share at least .
I think we 've lucked into something .
HACKETT
Oh , for God 's sakes , are you suggesting we put that lunatic back on the air yelling bullshit ?
DIANA
Yes , I think we should put Beale back on the air tonight and keep him On .
Did you see the Times this morning ?
Did you see the News ?
We 've got press coverage on this you could n't buy for a million dollars .
Frank , that dumb show jumped five rating points in one night !
Tonight 's show has got to be at least fifteen !
We just increased our audience by twenty or thirty million people in one night .
You 're not going to get something like this dumped in your lap for the rest of your days , and you just can't piss it away !
Howard Beale got up there last night and said what every American feels -- that he 's tired of all the bullshit .
He 's articulating the popular rage .
I want that show , Frank .
I can turn that show into the biggest smash in television .
HACKETT
What do you mean , you want that show ?
It 's a news show .
It 's not your department .
DIANA I see Howard Beale as a latter - day prophet , a magnificent messianic figure , inveighing against the hypocrisies of our times , a strip Savonarola , Monday through Friday .
I tell you , Frank , that could just go through the roof .
And I 'm talking about a six dollar cost per thousand show !
I 'm talking about a hundred , a hundred thirty thousand dollar minutes !
Do you want to figure out the revenues of a strip show that sells for a hundred thousand bucks a minute ?
One show like that could pull this whole network right out of the hole !
Now , Frank , it 's being handed to us on a plate ; let 's not blow it !
HACKETT 's intercom BUZZES .
HACKETT ( on intercom ) Yes ? ...
Tell him I 'll be a few minutes .
( clicks off , regards DIANA )
Let me think it over .
DIANA Frank , let 's not go to committee about this .
It 's twenty after ten , and we want Beale in that studio by half - past six .
We do n't want to lose the momentum -- HACKETT For God 's sakes , Diana , we 're talking about putting a manifestly irresponsible man on national television .
I 'd like to talk to Legal Affairs at least .
And Herb Thackeray and certainly Joe Donnelly and Standards and Practices .
And you know I 'm going to be eyeball to eyeball with Mr. Ruddy on this .
If I 'm going to the mat with Ruddy , I want to make sure of some of my ground .

CHANEY ( who is standing ) I do n't believe this !
I do n't believe the top brass of a national television network are sitting around their Caesar salads -- HACKETT
The top brass of a bankrupt national television network , with projected losses of close to a hundred and fifty million dollars this year .
CHANEY
I do n't care how bankrupt !
You can't seriously be proposing and the rest of us seriously consider - ing putting on a pornographic network news show !
The FCC will kill us !
HACKETT

CHANEY The New York Times -- HACKETT
The New York Times does n't advertise on our network .
CHANEY ( stands )
All I know is that this violates every canon of respectable broad- casting .
HACKETT
We 're not a respectable network .
We 're a whorehouse network , and we have to take whatever we can get .
CHANEY
Well , I do n't want any part of it .
I do n't fancy myself the president of a whorehouse .
HACKETT
That 's very commendable of you , Nelson .
Now , sit down .
Your indignation has been duly recorded , you can always resign tomorrow .
CHANEY sits .
HACKETT
Look , what in substance are we proposing ?
-- merely to add editorial comment to our network news show .
Brinkley , Sevareid , and Reasoner all have their comments .
So now Howard Beale will have his .
I think we ought to give it a shot .
Let 's see what happens tonight .
DONNELLY
Well , I do n't want to be the Babylonian messenger who has to tell Max Schumacher about this .
HACKETT ( flagging a WAITER ) Max Schumacher does n't work at this network any more .

That 's my other phone , Fred , thanks for calling -- ( hangs up , picks up the other phone ) Max Schumacher . ..
Hi , Dick , how 's everything at NBC ?

I might teach , I might write a book , whatever the hell one does when one approaches the autumn of one 's years -- HOWARD puts the photograph on the desk in front of MAX .
MAX ( studying the photograph ) My God , is that me ?
Was I ever that young ?

Even the SECRETARIES have left their desks to share the fun .

I grab my raincoat , run down the stairs , run out into the middle of the street , flag a cab .
I jump in , I yell : " Take me to the middle of the George Washington Bridge ! " -- HOWL of LAUGHTER -- MAX --
The driver turns around , he says : " Do n't do it , kid , you got your whole life ahead of you ! "
The room ROCKS with LAUGHTER .
When it subsides , BOB McDONOUGH , standing in the doorway , says : McDONOUGH
Well , if you think that 's funny , wait 'll you hear this .
I 've just come down from Frank Hackett 's office , and he wants to put Howard back on the air tonight .
Apparently , the ratings jumped five points last night , and he wants Howard to go back on and do his angry - man thing .
STEINMAN
What 're you talking about ?
McDONOUGH
I 'm telling you -- they want Howard to go on yelling bullshit .
They want Howard to go on spontaneously letting out his anger , a latter - day prophet , denouncing the hypocrisies of our times -- HOWARD
Hey , that sounds pretty good -- MAX
Who 's this they ?
McDONOUGH Hackett .
Chaney was there , the Legal Affairs guy , and that girl from Programming .
MAX Christenson ?
What 's she got to do with it ?
GIANINI ( in b.g. )
You 're kidding , are n't you , Bob ?
McDONOUGH
I 'm not kidding .
I told them : " We 're running a news department down there , not a circus .
And Howard Beale is n't a bearded lady .
And if you think I 'll go along with this bastardization of the news , you can have my resignation along with Max Schumacher 's right now .
And I think I 'm speaking for Howard Beale and everybody else down there in News .
HOWARD
Hold it , McDonough , that 's my job you 're turning down .
I 'll go nuts without some kind of work .
What 's wrong with being an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times ?
What do you think , Max ?
MAX
Do you want to be an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times ?
HOWARD
Yeah , I think I 'd like to be an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times .

RUDDY Nelson Chaney tells me Beale may actually go on the air this evening .
MAX
As far as I know , Howard 's going to do it .
Are you going to sit still for this , Ed? RUDDY ( takes a folded piece of paper from his inside jacket pocket ) Yes .
I think Hackett 's overstepped himself .
There 's some kind of corporate maneuvering going on , Max .
Hackett is clearly forcing a confrontation .
That would account for his behavior at the stockholders ' meeting .
However , I think he 's making a serious mistake with this Beale business .
C. C. and A. would never make such an open act of brigandage , especially against the News Division .
They are specifically enjoined against any manipulation of the News Division in the consent decree .
I suspect C. C. and A. will be upset by Hackett 's presumptuousness , certainly Mr. Jensen will .
So I 'm going to let Hackett have his head for awhile .
He just might lose it over this Beale business .
( places the paper on MAX 's desk ) I 'd like you to reconsider your resignation .
( moves to the couch , sits , crosses his legs , murmurs ) I have to assume Hackett would n't take such steps without some support on the C. C. and A. board .
I 'll have to go directly to Mr. Jensen .
When that happens , I 'm going to need every friend I 've got .
And I certainly do n't want Hackett 's people in all the divisional positions .
So I 'd like you to stay on , Max .
MAX
Of course , Ed. RUDDY ( stands )
Thank you , Max .
He opens the door and leaves .

MAX'S OFFICE - WEDNESDAY , OCTOBER 1 - 7:00 P.M. MAX sitting alone behind his desk in a dark office lit only by his desk lamp , watching the Network News Show starring HOWARD BEALE on his office console -- NARRATOR
The initial response to the new Howard Beale was not auspicatory .
The press was without exception hostile and industry reaction negative .
The ratings for the Thursday and Friday show were both 14 and with a 37 share , but Monday 's rating dropped two points , clearly suggesting the novelty had worn off --
On the office console , HOWARD BEALE does n't seem too much different than he had always been .
He scowls , frowns , seems to be muttering -- NARRATOR -- Indeed , Howard Beale played his new role of latter - day prophet poorly .
He was , after all , a newsman , not an actor .
He was uncertain , uncomfortable , sometimes inaudible .
The general feeling around the network was that this new Howard Beale would be aborted in a matter of days -- 73 .
INT .
MAX'S OFFICE - LATER
On the office console , the Network News Show has come to an end ; the CLOSING THEME MUSIC emerges into SOUND , and the show 's CREDITS begin to roll .
MAX clicks off the set , folds his hands on the desk and sits glumly regarding his folded hands .
After a moment , he becomes aware of another presence in the room and looks to the doorway where DIANA CHRISTENSON is standing , wearing a white blouse and dark slacks and carrying her jacket and purse .
If we have n't already noticed how attractive she is , we do now -- standing as she is , framed in the doorway , backlit by the lights of the deserted common room , suddenly sensuous , even voluptuous .
DIANA ( entering the office )
Did you know there are a number of psychics working as licensed brokers on Wall Street ?
( she sits across from MAX , fishes a cigarette out of her purse )
Some of them counsel their clients by use of Tarot cards .
They 're all pretty successful , even in a bear market and selling short .
I met one of them a couple of weeks ago and thought of doing a show around her -- The Wayward Witch of Wall Street , something like that .
But , of course , if her tips were any good , she could wreck the market .
So I called her this morning and asked her how she was on predicting the future .
She said she was occasionally prescient .
" For example " , she said , " I just had a fleeting vision of you sitting in an office with a craggy middle - aged man with whom you are or will be emotionally involved . "
And here I am .
MAX
She does all this with Tarot cards ?
DIANA
No , this one operates on parapsychology .
She has trance - like episodes and feels things in her energy field .
I think this lady can be very useful to you , Max .
MAX
In what way ?
DIANA
Well , you put on news shows , and here 's someone who can predict tomorrow 's news for you .
Her name , aptly enough , is Sibyl .
Sybil the Soothsayer .
You could give her two minutes of trance at the end of a Howard Beale show , say once a week , Friday , which is suggestively occult , and she could oraculate .
Then next week , everyone tunes in to see how good her predictions were .
MAX Maybe she could do the weather .
DIANA ( smiles )
Your network news show is going to need some help , Max , if it 's going to hold .
Beale does n't do the angry man thing well at all .
He 's too kvetchy .
He 's being irascible .
We want a prophet , not a curmudgeon .
He should do more apocalyptic doom .
I think you should take on a couple of writers to write some jeremiads for him .
I see you do n't fancy my suggestions .
MAX
Hell , you 're not being serious , are you ?
DIANA
Oh , I 'm serious .
The fact is , I could make your Beale show the highest - rated news show in television , if you 'd let me have a crack at it .
MAX
What do you mean , have a crack at it ?
DIANA
I 'd like to program it for you , develop it .
I would n't interfere with the actual news .
But teevee is show biz , Max , and even the News has to have a little showmanship .
MAX My God , you are serious .
DIANA I watched your six o'clock news today -- it 's straight tabloid .
You had a minute and a half on that lady riding a bike naked in Central Park .
On the other hand , you had less than a minute of hard national and international news .
It was all sex , scandal , brutal crimes , sports , children with incurable diseases and lost puppies .
So I do n't think I 'll listen to any protestations of high standards of journalism .
You 're right down in the street soliciting audiences like the rest of us .
All I 'm saying is , if you 're going to hustle , at least do it right .
I 'm going to bring this up at tomorrow 's network meeting , but I do n't like network hassles , and I was hoping you and I could work this out between us .
That 's why I 'm here right now .
MAX ( sighs )
And I was hoping you were looking for an emotional involvement with a craggy middle - aged man .
DIANA I would n't rule that out entirely .
They appraise each other for a moment ; clearly , there are the possibilities of something more than a professional relationship here .
MAX
Well , Diana , you bring all your ideas up at the meeting tomorrow .
Because , if you do n't , I will .
I think Howard is making a goddam fool of himself , and so does everybody Howard and I know in this industry .
It was a fluke .
It did n't work .
Tomorrow , Howard goes back to the old format and this gutter depravity comes to an end .
DIANA ( smiles , stands )
Okay .
She leans forward to flick her ash into MAX 's desk ash tray .
Half - shaded as she is by the cone of light issuing from the desk lamp , it is nipple - clear she is bra-less , and MAX cannot help but note the assertive swells of her body .
DIANA moves languidly to the door and would leave but MAX suddenly says : MAX I do n't get it , Diana .
You hung around till half - past seven and came all the way down here just to pitch a couple of loony show biz ideas when you knew goddam well I 'd laugh you out of this office .
I do n't get it .
What 's your scam in this anyway ?
DIANA moves back to the desk and crushes her cigarette out in the desk tray .
DIANA
Max , I do n't know why you suddenly changed your mind about resigning , but I do know Hackett 's going to throw you out on your ass in January .
My little visit here tonight was just a courtesy made out of respect for your stature in the industry and because I 've personally admired you ever since I was a kid majoring in speech at the University of Missouri .
But sooner or later , now or in January , with or without you , I 'm going to take over your network news show , and I figured I might as well start tonight .
MAX I think I once gave a lecture at the University of Missouri .
DIANA I was in the audience .
I had a terrible schoolgirl crush on you for a couple of months .
She smiles , glides to the doorway again .
MAX Listen , if we can get back for a moment to that gypsy who predicted all that about emotional involvements and middle - aged men -- what 're you doing for dinner tonight ?
DIANA pauses in the doorway , and then moves back briskly to the desk , picks up the telephone receiver , taps out a telephone number , waits for a moment -- DIANA ( on phone ) I can't make it tonight , luv , call me tomorrow .
She returns the receiver to its cradle , looks at MAX ; their eyes lock .
MAX
Do you have any favorite restaurant ?
DIANA I eat anything .
MAX
Son of a bitch , I get the feeling I 'm being made .
DIANA
You sure are .
MAX I better warn you I do n't do anything on the first date .
DIANA
We 'll see .
She moves for the door .
MAX stares down at his desk .
MAX ( mutters ) Schmuck , what 're you getting into ?
He sighs , stands , flicks off his desk lamp .
74 . INT .
A RESTAURANT MAX and DIANA at the end of their dinner .
In fact , MAX is flagging a WAITER for two coffees , black -- DIANA ( plying away at her ice cream )
You 're married , surely .
MAX
Twenty - six years .
I have a married daughter in Seattle who 's six months pregnant , and a younger girl who starts at Northwestern in January .
DIANA --
Well , Max , here we are -- middle - aged man reaffirming his middle - aged manhood and a terrified young woman with a father complex .
What sort of script do you think we can make out of this ?
MAX Terrified , are you ?
DIANA ( pushes her ice cream away , regards him affably ) Terrified out of my skull , man .
I 'm the hip generation , man , right on , cool , groovy , the greening of America , man , remember all that ?
God , what humbugs we were .
In my first year at college , I lived in a commune , dropped acid daily , joined four radical groups and fucked myself silly on a bare wooden floor while somebody chanted Sufi sutras .
I lost six weeks of my sophomore year because they put me away for trying to jump off the top floor of the Administration Building .
I 've been on the top floor ever since .
Do n't open any windows around me because I just might jump out .
Am I scaring you off ?
MAX No. DIANA
I was married for four years and pretended to be happy and had six years of analysis and pretended to be sane .
My husband ran off with his boyfriend , and I had an affair with my analyst .
He told me I was the worst lay he had ever had .
I can't tell you how many men have told me what a lousy lay I am .
I apparently have a masculine temperament .
I arouse quickly , consummate prematurely , and can't wait to get my clothes back on and get out of that bedroom .
I seem to be inept at everything except my work .
I 'm goddam good at my work and so I confine myself to that .
All I want out of life is a 30 share and a 20 rating .
The WAITER brings the coffee .
MAX ( sipping coffee )
The corridor gossip says you 're Frank Hackett 's backstage girl .
DIANA ( sipping coffee , smiles ) I 'm not .
Frank 's a corporation man , body and soul .
He surrendered his spirit to C. C. and A. years ago .
He 's a marketing - merchandising management machine , precision - tooled for corporate success .
He 's married to one C. C. and A. board member 's daughter , he attends another board member 's church , his children aged two and five are already enrolled in a third board member 's alma mater .
He has no loves , lusts or allegiances that are not consummately directed towards becoming a C. C. and A. board member himself .
So why should he bother with me ?
I 'm not even a stockholder .
MAX
How about your loves , lusts and allegiances ?
They smile at each other .
DIANA
Is your wife in town ?
MAX Yes .
DIANA
Well , then , we better go to my place .

DIANA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM
Dark .
Blinds drawn .
MAX and DIANA lying naked on a maelstrom of sheets , both still puffing from what must have been an ebullient bout in the sack -- DIANA Wow , and you were the guy who kept telling me how he was going to be a grandfather in three months .
MAX
Hell , you were the girl who kept telling me what a lousy lay she was .
She bounces out of bed and stands naked in the shadowed darkness , arms akimbo , looking happily down at MAX on the bed .
DIANA
All right , enough of this love - making .
Are you going to let me take over your network news show or not ?
MAX ( laughs )
Forget it .
Tomorrow , Howard Beale goes back to being a straight anchorman .
I 'll tell him first thing tomorrow morning .
76 . INT .
HOWARD BEALE'S BEDROOM HOWARD BEALE , fast asleep in his dark , empty , hushed room .
HOWARD ( suddenly ) I can't hear you .
You 'll have to speak a little louder .
He gets up on one elbow , eyes still closed , cocks his head as if he were listening to someone mumbling from the rocking chair across the room .
HOWARD
You 're kidding .
How the hell would I know what the truth is ?
He sits up , gets out of bed , walks around and perches on the foot of the bed , stares at the empty rocker , nods his head as if he is following a complicated argument -- HOWARD
What the hell is this , the burning bush ?
For God 's sake , I 'm not Moses --
Whoever he thinks he is talking to apparently gets up and crosses the room to the overstuffed chair and sits there , since HOWARD follows this movement with his eyes and finally gets up and perches on the side of his bed in order to continue the curious conversation .
HOWARD
Why me ?
I 'm a deteriorating old man .
HOWARD listens , sighs , shrugs : HOWARD Okay .

The usual morning hum of activity .
PHONES RING .
HARRY HUNTER , going over some wire releases with his HEAD WRITER , looks up as MAX approaches -- MAX Howard in his office ?

Harry , I 'm killing this whole screwball angry prophet thing .
We 're going back to straight news as of tonight 's show .
HUNTER
Okay .
MAX veers off for -- 79 . INT .
HOWARD'S OFFICE HOWARD at his typewriter , clicking away .
MAX leans in through the open doorway -- MAX Howard , we 're going back to straight news tonight .
You do n't have to be the mad prophet any more .
HOWARD turns to regard MAX in the doorway with a sweet smile .
HOWARD I must go on with what I 'm doing , Max .
I have been called .
This is my witness , and I must make it .
This gives MAX pause , to say the least .
MAX
You must make what , Howard ?
HOWARD I must make my witness .
I must lead the people from the waters .
I must stay their stampede to the sea .
MAX takes a step into the office and closes the door .
MAX
You must stay their what , Howard ?
HOWARD
I must stay their headlong suicidal stampede to the sea .
MAX ( regards Howard for a moment )
Well , hallelujah , Howard , are you putting me on or have you flipped or what ?
HOWARD ( serenely ) I have heard voices , Max .
MAX
You have heard voices .
Swell .
What kind of voices , Howard ?
Still small voices in the night or the mighty thunder of God ?
Howard , you 've finally done it .
You 've gone over the edge .
You 're nuts .
HOWARD I have been called .
This is my witness , and I must make it .
MAX
Not on my goddam network news show .
He opens the door , goes back into -- 80 .
INT .
NIGHTLY NEWS ROOM -- where he stops , turns and wheels back to HOWARD 's office -- MAX Now , look , Howard , I 'm not kidding around about this .
You go back to being a straight anchorman tonight .
I 'm the voice you 're hearing now , and this voice is telling you we 're doing a straight news show from now on .
Okay ?
HOWARD seems not to have heard him , continues pecking away at his typewriter .
MAX scowls , turns , exits -- 81 . INT .
NETWORK NEWS CONTROL ROOM
The wall CLOCK says 6:29 .
The control room STAFF are all at their posts murmuring away .
HARRY HUNTER is on the phone -- HUNTER ( muttering into phone ) Max , I 'm telling you he 's fine .

He had everybody cracking up at the rundown meeting ... I told him , I told him ... 82 . INT .
NETWORK NEWS CONTROL ROOM - LATER
On the SHOW MONITOR , HOWARD BEALE at his desk , shuffles his papers , looks up for his cue .
The wall CLOCK clicks to 6:30 , the DIRECTOR murmurs into his mike .
HOWARD looks out from the screen to his vast audience and says : HOWARD ( ON MONITOR )
Last night , I was awakened from a fitful sleep at shortly after two o'clock in the morning by a shrill , sibilant , faceless voice that was sitting in my rocking chair .
I could n't make it out at first in the dark bedroom .
I said : " I 'm sorry , you 'll have to talk a little louder . "
And the Voice said to me : " I want you to tell the people the truth , not an easy thing to do ; because the people do n't want to know the truth . "
I said : " You 're kidding .
How the hell would I know what the truth is ? "
I mean , you have to picture me sitting there on the foot of the bed talking to an empty rocking chair .
I said to myself : " Howard , you are some kind of banjo - brain sitting here talking to an empty chair . "
But the Voice said to me : " Do n't worry about the truth .
I 'll put the words in your mouth . "
And I said : " What is this , the burning bush ?
For God 's sake , I 'm not Moses . "
And the Voice said to me : " And I 'm not God , what 's that got to do with it --" 83 .

MAX'S OFFICE MAX behind his desk on his phone , chin cupped in his right hand , staring glumly at HOWARD on his CONSOLE -- MAX ( on phone ) Nothing -- HOWARD ( ON CONSOLE )
And the Voice said to me : " We 're not talking about eternal truth or absolute truth or ultimate truth !
We 're talking about impermanent , transient , human truth !
I do n't expect you people to be capable of truth !
But , goddamit , you 're at least capable of self - preservation !
That 's good enough !
I want you to go out and tell the people to preserve themselves -- " MAX ( mutters on phone ) Right now , I 'm trying to remember the name of that psychiatrist that took care of him when his wife died -- 85 .

He and HUNTER go into -- 90 .

HOWARD'S OFFICE where MAX is sitting , waiting on the couch .
He stands -- MAX
Close the door , Harry -- HUNTER does so .
MAX
Sit down , Howard .
Howard , I 'm taking you off the air .
I called your psychiatrist .
HOWARD ( serene , sits behind his desk )
What 's happening to me , Max , is n't mensurate in psychiatric terms .
MAX
I think you 're having a breakdown , require treatment , and Dr. Sindell agrees .
HOWARD
This is not a psychotic episode .
It is a cleansing moment of clarity .
( stands , an imbued man ) I am imbued , Max .
I am imbued with some special spirit .
It 's not a religious feeling at all .
It is a shocking eruption of great electrical energy : I feel vivid and flashing as if suddenly I had been plugged into some great cosmic electromagnetic field .
I feel connected to all living things , to flowers , birds , to all the animals of the world and even to some great unseen living force , what I think the Hindus call prana .
He stands rigidly erect , his eyes staring mindlessly out , his face revealing the anguish of so transcendental a state .
HOWARD
It is not a breakdown .
I have never felt so orderly in my life !
It is a shattering and beautiful sensation !
It is the exalted flow of the space - time continuum , save that it is spaceless and timeless and of such loveliness !
I feel on the verge of some great ultimate truth .
He stares haggardly at MAX , his breath coming with great difficulty now ; he shouts : HOWARD
You will not take me off the air for now or for any other spaceless time !
He promptly falls in a dead swoon onto the floor .
MAX ( hurrying to his friend 's prostrate form ) Jesus Christ -- HUNTER ( from the door )
Is he okay ?
MAX ( bent over HOWARD )
He 's breathing anyway .
I 'll have to take him to my house again for the night -- A CRASH OF THUNDER -- 91 .

The son of a bitch is a hit , goddammit !
Over two thousand phone calls !
Go down to the mailroom !
As of this minute , over fourteen thousand telegrams !
The response is sensational !
Herb , tell him !

Herb 's phone has n't stopped ringing !
Every goddam affiliate from Albuquerque to Sandusky !
The response is sensational !
The PHONE RINGS , HACKETT seizes it .
HACKETT
What ?

All right
He hangs up , snaps at THACKERAY -- HACKETT
It 's your office , Herb .
You better get back there .
THACKERAY exits .
HACKETT roars on -- HACKETT Moldanian called me !
Joe Donnelly called me !
We 've got a goddam hit , goddam it !
Diana , show him the Times !
We even got an editorial in the holy goddam New York Times .
" A Call to Morality ! "
That crazy son of a bitch , Beale , has caught on !
So do n't tell me you do n't know where he is !
MAX ( roaring back ) I do n't know where he is !
He may be jumping off a roof for all I know .
The man is insane .
He 's no longer responsible for himself .
He needs care and treatment .
And all you grave - robbers care about is he 's a hit !
DIANA
You know , Max , it 's just possible that he is n't insane , that he is , in fact , imbued with some special spirit .
MAX My God , I 'm supposed to be the romantic ; you 're supposed to be the hard - bitten realist !
DIANA
All right .
Howard Beale obviously fills a void .
The audience out there obviously wants a prophet , even a manufactured one , even if he 's as mad as Moses .
By tomorrow , he 'll have a 50 share , maybe even a 60 share .
Howard Beale is processed instant God , and right now it looks like he may just go over bigger than Mary Tyler Moore .
MAX I 'm not putting Howard back on the air .
DIANA
It 's not your show any more , Max , it 's mine .
MAX
You 're nuts .
You 're nuttier than Howard .
HACKETT
I gave her the show , Schumacher .
I 'm putting the network news show under programming .
Mr. Ruddy has had a mild heart attack and is not taking calls .
In his absence , I 'm making all network decisions , including one I 've been wanting to make a long time -- you 're fired .
I want you out of this building by noon .
I 'll leave word with the security guards to throw you out if you 're still here .
MAX
Well , let 's just say , fuck you , Hackett .
You want me out , you 're going to have to drag me out kicking and screaming .
And the whole news division will walk out kicking and screaming with me .
HACKETT
You think they 're going to quit their jobs for you .
Not in this depression , buddy .
MAX
When Ruddy gets back , he 'll have your ass .
HACKETT I got a hit , Schumacher , and Ruddy does n't count any more .
He was hoping I 'd fall on my face with this Beale show , but I did n't .
It 's a big , fat , big - titted hit , and I do n't have to waffle around with Ruddy any more .
If he wants to take me up before the C.C. and A. board , let him .
And do you think Ruddy 's stupid enough to go to the CCA board and say : " I 'm taking our one hit show off the air ? "
And comes November Fourteen , I 'm going to be standing up there at the annual CCA management review meeting , and I 'm going to announce projected earnings for this network for the first time in five years .
And , believe me , Mr. Jensen will be sitting there rocking back and forth in his little chair , and he 's going to say : " That 's very good , Frank , keep it up . "
So do n't have any illusions about who 's running this network from now on .
You 're fired .
I want you out of your office before noon or I 'll have you thrown out .
( to DIANA )
And you go along with this ?
DIANA
Well , Max , I told you I did n't want a network hassle over this .
I told you I 'd much rather work the Beale show out just between the two of us .
MAX ( stands )
Well , let 's just say , fuck you too , honey .
( to HACKETT ) Howard Beale may be my best friend !
I 'll go to court .
I 'll put him in a hospital before I let you exploit him like a carnival freak .
HACKETT
You get your psychiatrists , and I 'll get mine .
MAX ( heading for the door ) I 'm going to spread this whole reeking business in every paper and on every network , independent , group , and affiliated station in this country .
I 'm going to make a lot of noise about this .
HACKETT Great !
we need all the press we can get .
MAX exits .
HACKETT clicks his intercom .
HACKETT ( on intercom ) Get me Mr. Cabell -- ( to DIANA ) Something going on between you and Schumacher ?
DIANA ( sighs )
Not any more .

Lots of Arab headdresses and bearded Levantine faces at conference tables , and we are hearing the VOICE of Edward Fletcher in Vienna -- FLETCHER ( ON MONITOR )
This has probably been the most divisive meeting the oil - producing states have ever had .
The thirteen nations of OPEC have still not been able to decide by how much to increase the price of oil --

HOWARD ( ON MONITOR )
I do n't have to tell you things are bad .
Everybody knows things are bad .
It 's a depression .
Everybody 's out of work or scared of losing their job , the dollar buys a nickel 's worth , banks are going bust , shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter , punks are running wild in the streets , and there 's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do , and there 's no end to it .
We know the air 's unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat , and we sit and watch our tee -vees while some local newscaster tells us today we had fifteen homicides and sixty - three violent crimes , as if that 's the way it 's supposed to be .
We all know things are bad .
Worse than bad .
They 're crazy .
It 's like everything 's going crazy .
So we do n't go out any more .
We sit in the house , and slowly the world we live in gets smaller , and all we ask is please , at least leave us alone in our own living rooms .

FLOOR DIANA bursts out of the just - arrived elevator and strides down to where a clot of EXECUTIVES and OFFICE PERSONNEL
With the new Ironman movie scheduled to premiere in May ( see the trailer above ) , DaRK PaRTY decided it was time to set some limits .
Not every superhero and villain is worthy of celluloid fame .
So far we ’ve gotten films about Batman , Superman , X - Men , the Fantastic Four , Spiderman , Punisher , Swamp Thing , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Dick Tracy , Hulk , Daredevil , Captain America , Electra , Blade , Hellboy , Crow , and even Howard the Duck .
Most are worthy ( we ’ll leave Electra and Howard the Duck on the table ) .
But the film industry is beginning to run out of A - list superheroes .
We want to make sure that we do n’t dig too deep into the annals of superhero comics .
It could be dangerous – if not downright embarrassing .
That ’s why we ’ve compiled a list of 12 superheroes and villains that no one in their right mind would opt for the Hollywood treatment .
In fact , these superheroes are so lame – most people would n’t even want to have their powers .
Editor ’s Note :
We are n’t including Robin on the list .
Robin is the king of lame superheroes and therefore is automatically including in any list of lame - ass superheroes – even if he is n’t officially listed .
The Whizzer
Secret Identity : Robert L. Frank
Origin :
In Africa with his doctor father , Frank is bitten by a cobra .
His father injects him with the blood of a mongoose to counteract the cobra venom .
The result : super speed .
Powers :
He ’s very , very fast .
Appearance : With the name The Whizzer it may have been a mistake to put him in a bright yellow costume .
Lame Factor : I guess the name The Flash was taken , but , my God , the Whizzer ?
Creator : Timely Comics ( later Marvel Comics )
First Appeared : 1941
Snide Comment : The United States was on the verge of entering World War II – so clearly people were distracted .
But naming a superhero after a bodily function probably doomed The Whizzer from becoming the next Superman .
Beak
Secret Identity : Barnell Bohusk
Origin : Barnell was born a mutant that gave him birdlike qualities – except , amazingly , the power to fly .
Powers :
He can glide for short distances , has enhanced eyesight , and his hands are talons .
Oh , he ’s got feathers , too .
Appearance : A plucked chicken clad in X - Men leather .
Lame Factor :
These are powers ?
Poor bastard should hunt down the folks at Purdue .
Creator : Marvel Comics ( a minor mutant character in the X - Men series )
First Appeared : 2001
Snide Comment :
We wonder if he tastes like chicken .
Believe it or not , but Beak has become a fan favorite and even has a fan site dedicated to him .
The Gay Ghost
Secret Identity : Keith Everet
Origin : Everet is the Earl of Strethmere ( in Ireland ) when he is attacked by bandits who steal his purse ( no really ! ) .
He ’s murdered and his spirit goes to heaven where his ancestors agree to allow him to return to earth as the Gay Ghost .
Powers :
He can possess other people ’s bodies and is an expert , ahem , swordsman .
Appearance : An 18th century Earl – who happens to have long , luscious hair , is transparent , and ghostly .
Lame Factor :
He ’s called the Gay Ghost – which is an enormous liability .
Creator : DC Comics
First Appeared : 1942
Snide Comment : Clearly , the gay movement had n’t happened when Gay Ghost was created – and yet the character seems to be , well , gay .
Wallflower
Secret Identity : Laurie Collins
Origin : Collins grew up in a single - parent home before becoming a student at the Xavier Institute ( famous as home of the X - Men ) .
Powers :
She can manipulate the emotions of other people with pheromones .
Appearance :
She looks like a pouty , blond cheerleader .
Lame Factor :
She also acts like a pouty , blond cheerleader .
And her major power seems to be the ability to make people cry at whim .
Creator : Marvel Comics ( one of the more ridiculous mutants )
First Appeared : 2003
Snide Comment : Clearly , the folks at Marvel were having trouble with their teenage daughters .
Yet here ’s another minor superhero with a fan site .
Power Girl
Secret Identity : Kara Zor-L
Origin : Okay , she was blasted into space after the planet Krypton exploded .
If this sounds familiar – it is .
This is exactly the same origin as Superman .
Superman , in fact , is her cousin .
Powers : Exactly the same as Superman ( enormous strength , X - ray vision , blah , blah , blah ) .
Appearance :
White spandex bathing suit with an amazing push - up bra .
Lame Factor : She ’s Superman with Jennifer Aniston ’s hair and gravity defying breasts .
Creator : DC Comics ( apparently developed during a very bad brainstorm session ) .
First Appeared : 1976
Snide Comment :
This is what Superman would look like if he was a stripper .
Hawkman
Secret Identity : Carter Hall
Origin : Hall is the reincarnation of Prince Khufu who died centuries ago while in combat with an Egyptian wizard .
Powers :
He can fly using artificial wings made of Nth mental from the Planet Thanagar .
Appearance : A guy in a hawk outfit – generally not wearing a shirt .
Lame Factor :
He ’s got wings and uses spears and maces as weapons .
One gets the sense that even Green Arrow could take him .
Creator : DC Comics
First Appeared : 1940
Snide Comment : Could not come up with a better name than Hawkman ?
Brother Voodoo

Jabber / XMPP communities .
Our XMPP gateway at xmpp.oscar.aol.com , which
we ’ve been working on for a while now , is just one approach we ’re
tinkering with .
As you pointed out , though , this particular server at
xmpp.oscar.aol.com is a test server , so I would n’t count on it being
reliable or even continuously available until we put some more work into
it to bring it up to our standards .
In the meantime , keep your eyes open for more announcements from us

We ’re excited by the work we ’re doing and the support we’ve
received from the broader internet community and hope you ’ll be just as
excited by what we ’ve got to offer .

A paid FBI informant was the man behind a neo -Nazi march through the streets of Parramore that stirred up anxiety in Orlando 's black community and fears of racial unrest that triggered a major police mobilization .
That revelation came Wednesday in an unrelated federal court hearing and has prompted outrage from black leaders , some of whom demanded an investigation into whether the February 2006 march was , itself , an event staged by law - enforcement agencies .
The FBI would not comment on what it knew about the involvement of its informant , 39 - year - old David Gletty of Orlando , in the neo - Nazi event .
In court Wednesday , an FBI agent said the bureau has paid its informant at least $ 20,000 during the past two years .
" Wow , " Gletty said when reached by phone late Wednesday .
" It is what it is .
You were there in court .
I can't really go into any detail now . "
Orlando City Councilwoman Daisy Lynum , whose district includes the march route west of Interstate 4 , said she wants to know who was behind the march , the neo -Nazis or the FBI and other law - enforcement agencies .
" If it was staged , I would feel very uncomfortable and would ask for a full - scale investigation , " Lynum said .
" To come into a predominantly black community which could have resulted in great harm to the black community ?
I would hate to be part of a game .
It 's a mockery to the community for someone else to be playing a game with the community . "
Others applauded the FBI 's infiltration of the neo -Nazis .
" It 's one of the largest extremist groups in the country , and Gletty was one of the most visible individuals in the National Socialist Movement , " said Andy Rosenkranz , state regional director for the Anti-Defamation League .
" Generally , the FBI and the JTTF ( Joint Terrorism Task Force ) in Florida does an excellent job . "
Rally puts city in spotlight
Orlando drew national attention when the city granted a permit to Gletty so a minimum of 100 white supremacists and National Socialist Movement members could march Feb. 25 through the historically black Parramore neighborhood .
Wearing swastikas and holding signs declaring " White Pride , " the 22 neo - Nazis who turned out were protected from 500 counterprotesters by about 300 police officers .
Gletty 's secret life became public Wednesday in a federal court hearing resulting from the arrest last week of two suspected white supremacists on charges of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine .
Last Thursday , the FBI arrested Tom Martin , 23 , and John Rock , 35 , after Gletty wore a wire to a meeting and agreed to help them rob a drug dealer in Casselberry , according to testimony .
Rock told Gletty in a tape - recorded conversation that he and Martin had robbed seven drug dealers by posing as law - enforcement officers , according to testimony .
Martin and Rock remain held without bail in the Seminole County Jail .
Slip - up lets name out of bag
Throughout most of the hearing , Gletty was referred to as " Mr. X " or " CW " ( cooperating witness ) .
His identity was revealed when Assistant Federal Public Defender Peter W. Kenny repeatedly slipped up and mentioned Gletty 's full name .
FBI agent Kevin Farrington and a federal prosecutor were clearly uncomfortable with the disclosure of the informant 's name in open court .
Questioned about Gletty 's role in the march , Farrington testified that " he participated in it .
He did not organize it .
. . .
[ That 's ] pretty good firsthand information , sir . "
The city parade permit , however , lists Gletty as the " on scene event manager . "
And pictures of Gletty addressing marchers sporting swastika armbands for the Orlando rally appear on a neo -Nazi Web site .
Captions from other photos on the site mock the counterdemonstrators and the police presence .
On another Web site , Gletty details his role in organizing the Orlando event and hosting a victory party afterward .
" On 1/17/06 I got the permits and started the ball rolling , " he writes .
" On 2/25/06 at 3 pm on saturday [ sic ] in downtown Orlando My crew and I got it done . "
In another part of the posting , he writes : " Since I was the permit holder I was the person to deal with the police and had over - all authority of the event . "
No word from FBI
FBI officials did not return calls asking for specifics about the agency 's relationship with Gletty .
A tree - trimmer in Orlando , he withdrew from the National Socialist Movement last fall to pursue other projects , Farrington testified .
Orlando police Deputy Chief Pete Gauntlett , who supervised the march preparations , would not say what the FBI told police about Gletty and other marchers .
" We let them express their free speech and let them do what they 're allowed to do , but we wanted to have control , " Gauntlett said .
Bill White , a former spokesman for the National Socialist Movement who participated in the rally and now runs another neo -Nazi group , said he was surprised to hear of Gletty 's involvement with the FBI .
He said Gletty did a lot for the cause .
A neo -Nazi offers his take
" If he was being sponsored by the FBI , then American National Socialism has a lot to thank the FBI for , " White said in an e-mail .
Lynum said that if the FBI was behind the march , she would like the agency to reimburse the city for the tens of thousands it spent to send officers -- including SWAT - team and mounted - unit members -- to police the march .
Adora Obi Nweze , president of the State Conference NAACP in Miami , said she was disturbed an informant set up the march and was working for the FBI .
" That 's very troubling that somebody like that would be an informant for the FBI , " she said .
" You never know what they are capable of .
No question , it bothers me . "
But Alzo Reddick , a former state legislator who grew up in segregated Orlando , lived through KKK marches and later taught black history , said he was proud of the way the police and the community responded .
He was a member of the " Be Cool " movement organized to calm the community before the march .
" I think law enforcement has to walk in some murky places to be where the bad guys are , " Reddick said .
" Was the FBI informant an activist or a participant ?
Was he the agent provocateur from the get - go ?
Sure , that would be part of what I 'd like to know . "
Rene Stutzman , Jim Leusner and Willoughby Mariano of the Sentinel staff contributed to this report .
Ten days after a Golf Channel anchor was suspended for her use
of " lynch " in commentary on Tiger Woods , an editor was fired
Friday for illustrating the controversy with a noose on the cover
of Golfweek magazine .
Dave Seanor , vice president and editor who took responsibility
for the noose cover of the Jan. 19 issue , was replaced by Jeff
Babineau .
Golfweek 's controversial cover for its Jan. 19 issue .
The magazine has removed it from its Web site .
Golf Weekly
" We apologize for creating this graphic cover that received
extreme negative reaction from consumers , subscribers and
advertisers across the country , " Turnstile Publishing Co .
president William J. Kupper Jr. said .
" We were trying to convey
the controversial issue with a strong and provocative graphic
image .
It is now obvious that the overall reaction to our cover
deeply offended many people .
For that , we are deeply apologetic . "
Turnstile is the parent company of Golfweek , which has a
circulation of about 160,000 .
Golfweek removed its Jan. 19 issue from its booth at the PGA
Merchandise Show in Orlando , Fla. , while Babineau made the rounds
on news talk shows to offer more apologies .
The magazine also
removed the cover from its Web site .
PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem called the Golfweek cover
" outrageous and irresponsible " and accused the magazine of
tabloid journalism .
He distanced himself from the firing of Seanor
with a statement from the PGA Tour that Finchem merely was
responding to an inquiry , and that his comments were not a " call
to action . "
Woods , out of public view for the last month , makes his 2008
debut on the PGA Tour next week at the Buick Invitational , where
Golf Channel anchor Kelly Tilghman returns from a two - week
suspension .
Woods has not spoken publicly , although his agent said in a
statement through Golf Channel last week that Woods and Tilghman
are friends , and " we know unequivocally that there was no ill
intent in her comments . "
The episode began Jan. 4 during the second round of the
season - opening Mercedes - Benz Championship when Tilghman and analyst
Nick Faldo were discussing possible challengers to Woods .
Faldo suggested that " to take Tiger on , maybe they should just
gang up [ on him ] for a while . "
" Lynch him in a back alley , " Tilghman said , laughing .
Golf Channel issued a statement four days later to say it
regretted the comment and that Tilghman had apologized to Woods .
But when the Rev. Al Sharpton demanded on CNN that she be fired ,
Golf Channel suspended Tilghman for two weeks .
The Golfweek cover shows a noose against a purple sky with the
title , " Caught in a Noose . "
The subtitle said , " Tilghman slips
up , and Golf Channel can't wriggle free . "
For many , the noose is
symbol of lynchings in the Old South .
According to Tuskeege
University , 3,466 blacks were lynched in the United States from
1882 to 1968 .
The magazine devoted four pages of news and commentary on the
topic , including a column on the back page supporting Tilghman and
asking that the controversy be kept in context .
In an editorial , the magazine explained why it felt the Tilghman
story deserved so much attention .
It was accompanied by a cartoon
that showed Sharpton holding a noose and offering it to a pair of
Golf Channel employees staring into a hole of thin ice , presumably
where Tilghman had been standing .
" One [ potential ] cover we had this week was on the young Australian phenom Jason Day , " Babineau said Friday in an interview on the Dan Patrick radio program , " and had we had to do it over again , certainly we wish we could go back to Monday and put that one on the cover . "
Babineau said he will write a story in the next issue of Golfweek to address the controversy .
" Our job is to say we 're sorry , and we 're going to do it with a front cover letter that I 'm going to write , and we 'll go on and cover the business of golf as we always did . "
The harshest criticism came from Finchem .
The PGA Tour is in the
second year of an unprecedented 15 - year contract with Golf Channel
to broadcast its weekday coverage and full coverage of 14
tournaments .
" Clearly , what Kelly said was inappropriate and unfortunate ,
and she obviously regrets her choice of words , " Finchem said in a
statement .
" But we consider Golfweek 's imagery of a swinging noose
on its cover to be outrageous and irresponsible .
It smacks of
tabloid journalism .
It was a naked attempt to inflame and keep
alive an incident that was heading to an appropriate conclusion . "
The tour issued a statement Friday that said Finchem 's comments
were " a response to an inquiry and an expression of the tour's
dissatisfaction with Golfweek 's choice of a cover image . "
The tour
said Golfweek 's decision on its editorial leadership was an
internal matter .
Jim Thorpe , 58 , is one of two black players on the Champions
Tour .
He sharply criticized Seanor .
" That was absolutely stupid .
That was just throwing fuel on the
fire , " Thorpe said .
" Why would you do that ?
He knew better . "
Thorpe has won three times on the PGA Tour and
13 times on the Champions Tour .
" It 's a shame we live in a world today stuff like that still
occurs , " he said .
Thorpe defended Tilghman , whom he knows personally .
He said her
comments were n't intended as a malicious statement .
He said the
anchor could have used many different words instead , but chose the
wrong one .
" We know there was no racist intent .
It was just a bad choice
of words , " he said .
" But the guy from Golfweek ?
Let him get
barbecued .
That 's just a major mistake on his part . "
Meanwhile , CBSSports.com reported Thursday that Jack Peter ,
chief operating officer of the World Golf Hall of Fame , said tour
officials had told the magazine it might withdraw $ 50,000 in
advertisements for the World Golf Village .
" Jack was not speaking on behalf of the PGA Tour , " spokesman
Ty Votaw said Friday .
" I can categorically tell you the PGA Tour
has not threatened any advertising pull . "
Among the tour 's corporate marketing partners is Golf Digest
Publications , which publishes the weekly magazine Golf World , a
competitor of Golfweek .
Golf World has an editorial relationship with ESPN.com .
" We have partnerships with a lot of media companies , " Votaw
said .
" This was an editorial decision that Tim was expressing an
opinion about .
I do n't think anyone should read anything else into
it .
It was simply a reaction to the image on the cover . "
Babineau has worked for Golfweek the last nine years as editor ,
deputy editor and senior writer .
" We know we have a job ahead of us to re-earn the trust and
confidence of many loyal readers , " he said .
" Our staff is very
passionate about the game .
Our wish is that one regretful error
does not erase more than 30 years of service we 've dedicated to
this industry . "
Information from The Associated Press is included in this report
Lt Col Jeffrey Chessani is the highest - ranking officer charged
Lt Col Jeffrey Chessani is charged with dereliction of duty and failing to report and investigate the deaths .
L/ Cpl Stephen Tatum is accused of involuntary manslaughter , reckless endangerment and aggravated assault .
The two men are the first to be sent to court martial in the biggest criminal case involving civilian deaths in Iraq .
Prosecutors allege that the marines shot unarmed people in retaliation for a roadside bomb attack that killed one of their comrades .
International outrage
In a ruling released at Camp Pendleton , California , Lt Gen James Mattis said he had decided to refer the charges against the two men to a general court martial after reviewing evidence presented during Article 32 investigation hearings .
Lt Col Chessani is the most senior US serviceman since the Vietnam War to face a court martial for actions in combat .
L/ Cpl Tatum was initially charged with unpremeditated murder
Eight US soldiers were originally charged in connection with the killings , which sparked international outrage .
In August , murder charges against one of L / Cpl Tatum 's fellow marines , L / Cpl Justin Sharratt , were dropped by military prosecutors because they were not supported by sufficient evidence .
Charges against another murder suspect , Sgt Sanick Dela Cruz , were dropped in April in exchange for his testimony .
Two weeks ago , investigators recommended withdrawing murder charges against Sgt Frank Wuterich , who is accused of leading the massacre , and instead trying him for negligent homicide .
Four officers were initially charged with dereliction and failing to report and investigate the killings .
Those against Capt Randy Stone and Capt Lucas M McConnell have been dismissed , whereas 1st Lt Andrew A Grayson is awaiting a preliminary hearing .
Contradictions
Twenty - four Iraqi civilians , including three women , seven children and several elderly men , died at Haditha , in Anbar province , on 19 November 2005 .
HADITHA CHARGES Lt Col Jeffrey R Chessani : Violation of a lawful order , dereliction 1st Lt Andrew A Grayson : Dereliction , false official statement , obstructing justice Capt Lucas M McConnell : Dereliction ; Charges dismissed L / Cpl Stephen B Tatum : Involuntary manslaughter , reckless endangerment , aggravated assault Staff Sgt Frank D Wuterich : Unpremeditated murder , soliciting another to commit an offence , false official statement Sgt Sanick P Dela Cruz : Unpremeditated murder , false official statement ; Charges dismissed in exchange for testimony L/ Cpl Justin L Sharratt : Unpremeditated murder ; Charges dismissed Capt Randy W Stone : Violation of a lawful order ; dereliction of duty ; Charges dismissed
What happened at Haditha ?
US inquiries into Iraq deaths
The US military at first reported that the Iraqis had been killed by the improvised explosive device ( IED ) that killed L / Cpl Miguel Terrazas , or in a subsequent gunfight with insurgents .
But Iraqi witnesses said the US troops shot dead five unarmed men in a car when they approached the scene of the bombing in a taxi .
They were then accused of killing 19 other civilians in three houses nearby over the next few hours .
Despite the accusations , there was no full US investigation into what happened until January 2006 , when video footage emerged of the aftermath taken by a local human rights activist .
After a report in Time magazine showed flaws in the initial marine statement , a preliminary investigation was begun .
The inquiry confirmed civilians had been shot in their homes , but described the deaths as " collateral damage " .
In December , military authorities charged four marines with unpremeditated murder and another four with failing to properly report or investigate the deaths .
Editor 's note : CNN agreed not to use the full names of the mother and son in this article due to concern for their safety .
Youssif was known for his bright smile before he was attacked by masked men.

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Five - year - old Youssif is scarred for life , his once beautiful smile turned into a grotesquely disfigured face -- the face of a horrifying act by masked men .
They grabbed him on a January day outside his central Baghdad home , doused him with gas and set him ablaze .
It 's an act incomprehensibly savage , even by Iraq 's standards today .
No one has been arrested and the motive remains unknown .
In a war - ravaged city torn by sectarian violence and marked by acts of vengeance , this attack 's apparent randomness stands out as an example of what life has become in a place where brutality -- even against young children -- is a constant .
" They dumped gasoline , burned me , and ran , " Youssif told CNN , pointing down the street with his scarred hands where his attackers fled .
See photographs of Youssif before and after the attack »
As he sucked his thumb , he repeated , " I was burning . "
He tried to put the flames out himself .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
It looks as though this boy 's face melted and then froze into rivers cutting through swollen hard flesh .
It 's hard to see the energetic outgoing child his parents describe beneath the sullen demeanor that defines Youssif today .
" He 's become spiteful , I am not sure why , " said his mother , Zainab .
" He is jealous of everyone .
If I say the slightest thing to him , he cries .
He 's sensitive . "
Watch the mother describe how she cries at night wracked with guilt »
Even things like eating have become a chore .
His face contorts when he tries to shovel rice into his mouth , carefully angling the spoon and then using his fingers to push the little grains through lips he can no longer fully open .
He has also become jealous of the baby sister he used to dote on .
" I sit sometimes at night and cry , " Zainab said , her voice heavy with guilt .
" If only I had n't let him go outside , if only I had n't let him play . "
It was on January 15 that masked men attacked her boy , their identities still unknown .
Zainab said she was upstairs at the time .
" I heard screaming .
I thought someone was fighting or something , " she said .
She ran downstairs , saw her son and fainted .
When she came to , she barely recognized her child .
" His head was so swollen , you could n't see his eyes , and his nose was pushed in . "
" There was blood , " she added , shuddering slightly .
" The skin was melted off . "
He spent two months in the hospital recovering from the severe burns .
These days Youssif spends most of his time indoors , in front of the computer .
It 's only then that traces of the 5 - year - old in him emerge .
" He ca n't play outside with the other kids , " Zainab said .
" The other day they were playing , and he came in crying .
I asked him , ' What 's wrong ? ' and he said , ' They wo n't play with me because I am burned . ' "
She said he once wanted to be a doctor and he loved kindergarten .
" He used to be the one who would wake me up every morning , saying let 's go to school , " Zainab recalled .
She coaxed him to tell me the few words he knows in English .
" Girl , boy , window , fan , " he said , his voice barely audible , the words barely intelligible .
Doctors told the family there is little more they can do to help Youssif .
The family can't afford care outside Iraq .
So Zainab has taken a massive risk by telling her story to the world .
Her husband works as a security guard , and it's too dangerous for him to talk to the media .
" I 'd prefer death than seeing my son like this , " Zainab said .
All she wants is for someone to help her little boy smile again .

Update :
In September 2009 , I updated our Hackintosh build with a guide covering how to build a Hackintosh with Snow Leopard , start to finish .
Advertisement
Two months ago I walked through how to build a Hackintosh Mac on the cheap using PC parts .
Since that post , the OSx86 scene has changed rapidly , and now you can install Leopard on your computer about as easily as installing Leopard on a Mac - no command line hacking required .
In addition , the resulting installation can - theoretically , at least - be upgraded without fear of breaking .
As if the simplicity of the installation were n't already enough , the new installation tools fix any problems I 've had in the past ( for example , I no longer need to keep my install DVD in the drive to boot into OS X ) , and support the Wi-Fi card on my motherboard out - of - the - box .
In short , it 's a winner .

NOTE : I can only vouch for this method on the build I detailed in the original post , but others have had a lot of luck with other boards , as well .
If you 're thinking of starting from scratch and want to follow exactly how I did it , check out the sections labeled The Hardware and The Build on my original guide .
If you want to get a better idea of how well it runs , check out how it benchmarks compared to a Mac Pro and MacBook Pro .
If you 've got your system together , here 's how it works .
Set Your BIOS
The most difficult part of getting this installation to work with my board was getting the right BIOS settings in place .
In the course of figuring it out , I made a lot of different small tweaks , so to ensure I did n't miss any , I 've taken pictures of every relevant BIOS screen .
If you 're using the same board as me ( an Asus P5W DH Deluxe ) , just go through screen by screen and make sure that your BIOS settings match mine .
If you 're using a different board , these settings could still serve as a good guide , but they may not perfectly match up to yours .
( I 'm having a tough time remembering every BIOS setting I tweaked , so if you 're using a P5W DH Deluxe , your BIOS settings match mine , but you 're having trouble , let me know and I 'll try updating the gallery with more BIOS screens . )

Now that you 're BIOS are set , it 's time to install .
Install OS X with the Kalyway Install Disc
Floating around the BitTorrents , you 'll find a disc image called something like Kalyway Leopard 10.5.1 SSE2 SSE3 .
Download it and burn it to a DVD - it 's what you 'll use to install Leopard .
If you 're going to pursue this I 'd still recommend purchasing an actual copy of Leopard , but you wo n't need it here .

Basically this DVD contains the Leopard install disc along with the EFI software that lets your hardware work with OS X using the vanilla kernels - which is a big part of why you do n't have to do any of the command line hacking this time around .
You just install the disc and voilà - everything boots up and upgrades normally ( or at least that 's been my experience so far ) .
So assuming you 've built your computer using the original instructions , you 've got the Kalyway disc , and you 've already prepared your BIOS , you 're ready to install .
First , boot with the disc .
The disc boot up can take a few minutes , so you 'll need to be patient .
Advertisement
Before you go ahead with the installation you need to format your hard drive , so once the disc boots , go to Utilities -> Disk Utility in the menu bar .
Find the hard drive in the sidebar you want to install Leopard to , select it , then go to the Partition tab , and select a 1 partition volume scheme , name it whatever you want ( I called mine Leopard ) , and choose the Mac OS Extended ( Journaled ) format .
Now click the Options button to set the partition scheme .
You can choose the partition scheme as either Master Boot Record or GUID ( in my previous instructions you needed to set it as MBR ) .
I used GUID .
Advertisement
Click Apply , let it complete the partitioning , and then quit Disk Utility and head back to the Installer .
Hit Continue at the Welcome screen , agree to the terms , and then be sure to hit the Customize button before proceeding with your installation .
Here 's where the point - and - click magic of this installer comes in .

This install package comes with individual settings that match specific motherboards , and one very well supported board is the P5W DH Deluxe I used in the original build .
Rather than telling you which checkboxes to tick , just click the screenshot above for a look at all the settings you 'll want to use if you 're installing OS X on that board .
Advertisement
When you 're all set , click Done and then go ahead and Install .
When the installation is complete ( it 'll take a little while ) , let your computer restart , pop out the install disc , and sit back in wonder as Leopard runs on your PC in full 10.5.1 glory .
If you 've been living the Hackintosh life since our first guide , let 's hear how it 's worked out for you so far in the comments .
After a series of legislative defeats in 2007 , the year ended with more U.S. troops in Iraq than when it began .
Anti-war groups retreat on funding fight
After a series of legislative defeats in 2007 that saw the year end with more U.S. troops in Iraq than when it began , a coalition of anti-war groups is backing away from its multimillion - dollar drive to cut funding for the war and force Congress to pass timelines for bringing U.S. troops home .
In recognition of hard political reality , the groups instead will lower their sights and push for legislation to prevent President Bush from entering into a long - term agreement with the Iraqi government that could keep significant numbers of troops in Iraq for years to come .

The groups believe this switch in strategy can draw contrasts with Republicans that will help Democrats gain ground in November and bring the votes to pass more dramatic measures .
But it is a long way from the early months of 2007 , when Democrats were freshly in power and momentum for a dramatic shift in Iraq policy seemed overpowering .
“ There was a consensus that last year was not productive , ” John Isaacs , executive director of Council for a Livable World , said of a meeting attended by a coalition of anti-war groups last week .
“ Our expectations were dashed . ”
The meeting , held at an office on K Street , was attended by around 20 representatives of influential anti-war groups , including MoveOn.org and Americans Against Escalation in Iraq , which spent $ 12 million last year opposing the war .
Isaacs said he thought the meeting would be a difficult one , with an adamant faction pressing for continued focus on timelines and funding .
It was n’t to be .
“ We got our heads together and decided to go a different way , ” Isaacs said .
“ The consensus was not to keep beating our heads against the wall trying to block every funding bill — not because we do n’t agree with it , but because we do n’t have the votes . ”
Moira Mack , a spokeswoman for AAEI , was also at the meeting .
“ There was a lot of agreement that this is really the way that we can best get our message across about endless war versus end - the - war and draw clear distinctions between anti-war Democrats and pro-war Republicans .
They really do n’t want to end the war .
This is the perfect legislative opportunity . ”
An additional factor :
The failure of last year ’s end - of - the - session efforts to oppose the war convinced some in the movement that the numbers just were n’t there .
“ At the end of the year , Congress went out with a whole bunch more votes on Iraq with the same result .
Some of the [ news ] stories were saying that members of Congress were getting tired of it , ” Isaacs said .
The new strategy does n’t mean that the groups wo n’t be active during budget battles .
“ The budget debates provide an enormously rich opportunity to engage the public , ” said former Maine Rep. Tom Andrews of the group Win Without War .
“ We ’re spending $ 8 [ billion ] to $ 10 billion a month . ”
During Tuesday night ’s presidential debate , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) referenced the kind of legislation that the anti-war crowd will be backing when she asked Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) if he would co-sponsor a bill to prevent the president from entering into any long - term agreements with the Iraqi government without consulting Congress .
Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt said Obama will “ support all common - sense efforts to ensure that President Bush does not tie the hands of future presidents through agreements with the Iraqi government . ”
In December , Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) sent a strongly worded letter to Bush asking for information about what types of agreements the president planned to enter into and urging that he consult with Congress first .
It was signed by Clinton and Democratic Sens. Robert P. Casey Jr. ( Pa. ) , Robert C. Byrd ( W.Va . ) , Carl Levin ( Mich . ) and Edward M. Kennedy ( Mass . ) .
“ The feeling is that Clinton ’s too hot to handle for legislation right now , so we ’re hoping somebody like Casey will carry it , ” Isaacs said , expressing concern that Clinton ’s presidential run could give the bill too much partisan edge to get through the Senate .
In the House on Tuesday , Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D - Conn . ) introduced a bill that would make clear that no federal money could be spent to implement an agreement Bush reaches with Iraq unless it ’s in the form of a congressionally approved treaty .
Members of the anti-war coalition say they are working to gather co-sponsors for the bill but that they will also attempt to insert similar language in the upcoming supplemental spending bill .
Late last year , Bush requested nearly $ 200 billion for the war effort ; Democrats gave $ 70 billion and will be revisiting further funding soon .
For Mack , the logic of the argument seems straightforward .
“ Maliki is talking about getting congressional approval on the Iraq side , ” Mack said , referring to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
“ It ’s absurd that Bush would n’t go to the U.S. Congress . ”
The anti-war movement also thinks it has a winning argument when it comes to the length of time Americans are willing to see U.S. forces in Iraq .
Roughly half of Americans recently surveyed by CBS News want most U.S. troops out within a year , and more than half think it was a mistake to invade in the first place .
Every Democratic candidate for president has promised to withdraw almost all troops from Iraq within the first year of his or her presidency .
Earlier this week , Iraqi Defense Minister Abdul Qadir said U.S. troops might need to remain in Iraq until 2018 , which could cost the United States $ 1 trillion or more between now and then , according to Congressional Budget Office projections .
Bush said recently that it is “ fine with me ” if U.S. troop levels remain the same in Iraq , if Army Gen. David Petraeus recommends such a deployment .
Bush also said last week that U.S. troops “ could easily ” be in Iraq for a decade or more .
AAEI will have a budget roughly as large as it had last year , Mack said , and the new focus should be seen as an addition to its strategy , rather than as a retreat from a previous position .
“ Clearly , folks continue to oppose any more money for the war , and that was discussed as well .
Our groups are still going to actively oppose any more funding , ” she said .
A new species of bacteria discovered living in one of the most extreme environments on Earth could yield a tool in the fight against global warming .
In a paper published today in the prestigious science journal Nature , U of C biology professor Peter Dunfield and colleagues describe the methane - eating microorganism they found in the geothermal field known as Hell ’s Gate , near the city of Rotorua in New Zealand .
It is the hardiest “ methanotrophic ” bacterium yet discovered , which makes it a likely candidate for use in reducing methane gas emissions from landfills , mines , industrial wastes , geothermal power plants and other sources .
“ This is a really tough methane - consuming organism that lives in a much more acidic environment than any we ’ve seen before , ” said Dunfield , who is the lead author of the paper .
“ It belongs to a rather mysterious family of bacteria ( called Verrucomicrobia ) that are found everywhere but are very difficult to grow in the laboratory . ”
Methanotrophic bacteria consume methane as their only source of energy and convert it to carbon dioxide during their digestive process .
Methane ( commonly known as natural gas ) is 20 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and is largely produced by decaying organic matter .
Scientists have long known that vast amounts of methane are produced in acidic environments , not only geothermal sites but also marshes and peat bogs .
Much of it is consumed by methanotrophic bacteria , which serve an important role in regulating the methane content of the world ’s atmosphere .
“ Scientists are interested in understanding what conditions cause these bacteria to be more or less active in the environment ” says Dunfield , “ Unfortunately , few species have been closely studied .
We now know that there are many more out there . ”
Dunfield has tentatively named the new bacterium Methylokorus infernorum to reflect the ‘ hellish ’ location of its discovery where it lives in boiling waters filled with chemicals that are toxic to most life forms .
The Maori caretakers of the site , the Tikitere trust , have supported scientific study of the area .
The study was conducted while Dunfield was working for GNS Science , a geological research institute owned by the New Zealand government .
He recently joined the U of C’s Department of Biological Sciences as a professor of environmental microbiology .
The bacterium ’s genome has been completely sequenced by researchers at the University of Hawaii and Nankai University in China , which could help develop biotechnological applications for this organism .
Dunfield said he plans to pursue his work in Canada by hunting for new life forms in extreme environments such as northern peatlands , the oilsands of northern Alberta and the hot springs of Western Canada .
“ Hot springs are exotic and extreme habitats , where you find a lot of bizarre organisms , ” he said .
“ Bacteria are a fascinating group to work with because 95 per cent of them have never been studied in a lab and we have very little idea about what this huge amount of biodiversity is capable of . ”

The Academy Awards does n’t have a category for “ Best Galaxy Jet in a Leading Role ” , and that ’s too bad .
If they did give such an Oscar , a series of new movies captured by the National Science Foundation ’s Very Large Baseline Array would make some fine nominees .
Astronomers revisited the same galaxies for 15 years , capturing images of jets blasting out from their supermassive black holes .
These images were then stitched together into a series of timelapse movies .
The jet study is known as MOJAVE ( Monitoring of Jets in Active galactic nuclei with VLBA Experiments ) .
This is actually the successor to a previous study that tracked more than 200 jets from 1994 to 2002 .
The new survey used the National Science Foundation ’s Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA ) .
They made images of 200 galactic jets at regular intervals , tracking their motions and studying their magnetic - field properties .
For 100 of these jets , they actually produced time - lapse movies , allowing them to show the speed and direction of motion .
Where do the jets come from ?
They originate around the supermassive black holes that lurk at the hearts of galaxies .
Even though they weigh in with hundreds of millions of times the mass of the Sun , there ’s only so much material they can gobble up at any one time .
The material falls into a circular accretion disk orbiting the black hole .
The magnetic fields generated by the rotating black hole propels material out jets from the poles of the disk .
With long - term observations like this , the astronomers have been able to see how the jets change over time .
Many have remained constant , but some have been surprisingly active .
For some galaxies , the jets have brightened or dimmed over time .
Others have changed course as the supermassive black hole ’s magnetic field wrenched the particles into a new direction .
Jets have been seen to split apart .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Shoppers got a Christmas
Eve surprise on Monday when a pair of brothers handed out $ 100 ( 50 pound ) bills at a mall on Long Island , New York .
Police responded to a call from security staff at the Sunrise Mall in the town of Massapequa , concerned that the give - away might create a scene or involve counterfeit bills .
Instead , officers found a simple case of Christmas charity where calm prevailed as the businessmen , aged 45 and 41 , gave out the money at the entrance to the shopping centre , police said .
“ These two brothers say they do this every year .
They say they ’ve been blessed and just want to give something back , ” Detective Sergeant Anthony Repalone said .
“ They gave it to people who they thought needed it .
The people were very appreciative . ”
Police declined to identify the brothers , respecting their wish to remain anonymous .
A bipartisan group of Congressmen ( and one woman ) yesterday introduced a major bill aimed at boosting US intellectual property laws and the penalties that go along with them .
While much of the legislation targets industrial counterfeiting and knockoff drugs , it also allows the government to seize people 's computers .
The Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property ( PRO IP ... groan )
Act of 2007 has the backing of many of the most powerful politicians on the House Judiciary Committee , including John Conyers ( D - MI ) , Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) , and " Hollywood " Howard Berman ( D - CA ) .
In addition to strengthening both civil and criminal penalties for copyright and trademark infringement , the big development here is the proposed creation of the Office of the United States Intellectual Property Enforcement Representative ( USIPER ) .
This is a new executive branch office tasked with coordinating IP enforcement at the national and international level .
To do this work internationally , the bill also authorizes US intellectual property officers to be sent to other countries in order to assist with crackdowns there .
In addition , the Department of Justice gets additional funding and a new unit to help prosecute IP crimes .
The bill , which will have a committee hearing soon , is supposed to kick - start the copyright reform process talked about for so long .
But copyright reform means one thing to the PRO IP sponsors and another to the consumer groups that have been advocating for it .
Gigi Sohn , president of Public Knowledge , said in a statement , " seizing expensive manufacturing equipment used for large - scale infringement from a commercial pirate may be appropriate .
Seizing a family 's general - purpose computer in a download case , as this bill would allow , is not appropriate . "
In addition , she protests the increase in " already extraordinary copyright damages " and calls for damages to be linked more closely to actual harm suffered by copyright holders .
The Digital Freedom Campaign , backed by the EFF , Public Knowledge , and the Consumer Electronics Association , was more muted in its criticism , instead choosing to praise the legislation for launching a " conversation " about copyright reform .
The Digital Freedom Campaign 's Maura Corbett said that meaningful copyright reform " must include limits on statutory damages and the codification of the vital principles of fair use , " and she hopes that PRO IP " will serve as a catalyst to larger , more meaningful reform . "
Fortunately , at least some members of the Judiciary Committee are at least aware that the consumer groups have legitimate points to make .
Berman , who chairs the Subcommittee on Courts , the Internet and Intellectual Property , announced that his subcommittee would hold a hearing next week on the issue .
" As a cosponsor , I obviously feel very strongly that we must strengthen enforcement efforts to fight piracy and counterfeiting , " Berman said .
" At the hearing , we will be hearing testimony from both industry experts and from labor and consumer advocates to make sure that in doing so , we do n't deny appropriate access to America 's intellectual property . "
Who is thrilled with the bill ?
The MPAA , for one .
MPAA head Dan Glickman , in a statement praising the new bill , said that " films left costs foreign and domestic distributors , retailers and others $ 18 billion a year , " a significant increase from the $ 6 billion it allegedly costs the studios .
Know - It - All
We 're trying to get The Squiggle to say " I do n't know " when he does n't , well , know something .
It 's rough going , because it turns out that he 's a bluffer par excellence .
If he does n't know what something is , he just makes something up .
But there 's no hint of deception .
He really sells it .
{ I hold up a Hotwheels . }
Me : What 's this ?
Squiggle :
It 's a car .
M : That 's right .
{ I hold up a mug .}
Me : What 's this ?
S : It 's a cup .
M : It is a cup , good job !
{ I hold up an huge binder clip .} M : And what 's this ?
S : It 's a flongle .
M : It 's a -- what ?
S : A flongle .
M : Look , if you do n't know what it is , just say " I do n't know . "
What is this ?
S : I do n't know .
M : It 's a clip .
S : A clip .
M : Exactly .
{ I hold up a pair of needlenose pliers .} M : What 's are these ?
S : Those are jemplons .
Hopefully we 'll be able to break him of this habit soon .
On the other hand , we 're going to feel like idiots if we later find out that flongle and jemplons are the words for clip and pliers in Aramaic .
“ The difference between not busting your butt and busting your butt is the difference between a 3 % and a 4 % raise .
It should be obvious , even to the village idiot , that a system which creates such a sentiment is destined to fail . “
A programmer friend of mine found the post Compensation on the BlogSpot website Made To Wait .
Unfortunately , at posting time , this blog had two entries in as many months .
Thus , I decided to duplicate the article below for your viewing pleasure .
Remember , I did not write this and I edited the profanity .
So you would figure that software managers would figure out a sane way to handle compensation for programmers by now .
But , of course , they have n’t .
Most of them are your average Econ 101 bean counting weenies .
I can hear them now , “ We can only afford to give three to five percent raises each year , because if we paid everybody what they deserved , then we would be spending too much .
And what is it that these programmers do anyways ? ”
That ’s why an old co worker of mine told me one day over lunch that the difference between not busting your butt and busting your butt is the difference between a three percent raise and a four percent raise .
I think that it should be obvious , even to the village idiot , that a system which creates such a sentiment is destined to fail .
So let ’s take your classic example .
You have a junior to mid level developer who has been with you a year , and he excels .
He learns your business quickly .
He fits in with the team .
He , even at his junior level , brings a new way of thinking into the mix and keeps the senior guys from making bad decisions .
It comes down to review time , and you give him an average review and your standard , crappy , average raise .
But here in lies the problem .
He ’s worth a lot more now on the open market then he was a year ago .
You ’ve trained him and brought him along , and he kicks ass .
He not only has a good amount of experience in your industry now , but he has a good amount of experience at your company .
There is nothing that can replace that .
So this poor guy , who has the head hunters pestering him like crack addicts waiting for their next fix , now has to play hardball .
He has to threaten to leave in order to get what he clearly deserves , and no matter what happens , it ’s all down hill from there .
Let ’s say that you are lucky , and he takes his crappy raise and stays .
He will resent you for the rest of his life .
He will be a lot less productive .
In fact , he ’s probably spending most of his days day dreaming about architecting the “ f - you button ” .
They say that , at some point or another , every man thinks about killing his wife .
I do n’t know if that ’s true , but I can tell you that every programmer who has ever had a regular job has thought about the f - you button .
Thank God that 99.9 % of good coders are extremely ethical , because if they were n’t , then we would all be in trouble , but I digress .
A more likely scenario is that this bright young coder will finally break down and take a call from one of the bottom feeders , I mean head hunters , and he will land a job , somewhere else , making what he asked for , and taking all the things that you ’ve taught him over to someone else .
Then , of course , you have to replace him , and that takes a few months , and you ’ve lost all that good will , in all senses of the word .
The good will of your past and current employees who look upon you to treat them right , and the economic good will of a kick ass developer , whose worth far exceeds what you could ever pay him .
And guess what .
In order to replace him , you are going to have to pay the new guy as much money as he was asking for in the first place .
Plus that nice 15 % fee to the head hunter .
And now , because you were trying to be cheap , you have to spend even more than what you should have spent in the first place .
And God knows , you ’ll probably screw it up with this guy too , and thus the circle of life continues
The whinny little managers now have their hands up like pre-schoolers .
“ But Charles , ” they say .
“ What if we really ca n’t afford to pay him that much ? ”
Well , if you really can’t afford to pay him that much , and I mean REALLY ca n’t do it then that ’s where some leadership skills comes in .
You explain to him what ’s going on .
You tell him how valuable he is and how you know that he is worth more .
You promise to pay him what he ’s worth at a later date , like when you land a new client , and you stick to it .
Nine times out of ten , you get a happy coder who stays and works even harder for you than if you would have gave him the good raise .
Do n’t you wish that they would have taught you that when you got your MBA ?

The rise of the dinosaurs was prolonged , not sudden
Enlarge Image
It shows that dinosaurs co-existed with a more primitive group of reptiles for millions of years before becoming the most common land animals on Earth .
Experts had thought that once dinosaurs emerged , they swiftly replaced their relatives the dinosauromorphs .
But the latest study in Science journal questions this idea .
Dinosaurs first appeared around 230 - 220 million years ago , towards the end of the Triassic Period .
By the beginning of the Jurassic Period , about 200 million years ago , they had become the dominant creatures on land - and would remain so for another 135 million years .
We certainly know now that dinosaurs did n't take over immediately after they evolved
Dr Richard Butler , Natural History Museum
This is because the fossil record leading up to the Jurassic is relatively sparse .
Some researchers had assumed that dinosaurs were quick to supplant their more primitive relatives , the dinosauromorphs .
In other words , they got a " lucky break " .
Pace of change
Dinosaurs may have either outcompeted their reptilian relatives for resources , or taken advantage of some catastrophe that devastated the Dinosauromorpha .
But fossils described in the latest issue of Science suggest that if competition occurred , it was over a prolonged period , according to the team that unearthed them in the south - western US .
The primitive reptile Dromomeron romeri is new to science
The researchers also found a diverse range of other animals , including amphibians , fish and crocodile - like reptiles .
These , along with other contemporary fossil " assemblages " , imply the rise of the dinosaurs throughout the Triassic was a more gradual process .
Randall Irmis , from the University of California , Berkeley , US , and colleagues suggest the dinosaurs may have co-existed with the dinosauromorphs for some 15 - 20 million years .
" Finding dinosaur precursors - or basal dinosauromorphs - together with dinosaurs tells us something about the pace of changeover , " said Mr Irmis .
" If there was any competition between the precursors and dinosaurs , then it was a very prolonged competition . "
Important findings
Dr Richard Butler , a dinosaur specialist from London 's Natural History Museum , UK , called the study and the discoveries " very important " .
" The authors believe that their discovery demonstrates that the dinosaur takeover occurred gradually rather than rapidly .
We certainly know now that dinosaurs did n't take over immediately after they evolved , " he told the BBC News website .
But Dr Butler said there were still signs of rapid change at the conclusion of the Triassic .
" The big question is what happened right at the end of the Triassic period .
At this point we see one or more major extinction events , with all of the primitive dinosaur - like and crocodile - like reptiles becoming extinct , and only dinosaurs , crocodiles and pterosaurs ( flying reptiles ) surviving . "
Exactly when and how these extinction events occurred is poorly understood ; but asteroid strikes and climate change have been implicated .
" These extinctions may have opened up ecological space for dinosaurs to expand into , and might have occurred in a relatively short period of time , " Dr Butler explained .
" So in this sense I think it is still possible that early dinosaurs could have benefited from a ' lucky break ' . "

On a late - spring day in 2001 , Rudy Giuliani ’s divorce lawyer stood on the steps of the New York State Supreme Court Building and told reporters the shocking truth .
His client , the mayor of the city — beleaguered by an angry wife who wanted more money — had only $ 7,000 to his name .
Perhaps it was n’t quite the truth .
Just a year earlier , the mayor had $ 400,000 to $ 800,000 in pension and retirement funds due him , and now he had a $ 3 million book deal .
Still , in New York City , what was that for a powerful man of 57 ?
Not much .
Three months later came 9/11 .
Whatever deal Donna Hanover finally struck to end her marriage , she must feel cheated , because Giuliani is now worth somewhere between $ 18 million and $ 70 million .
A chunk of his personal fortune has come from giving speeches , month after month , for a standard fee of $ 100,000 .
Much of it , though , has been earned as founder and chief rainmaker of his consulting company , Giuliani Partners .
Headquartered in a 24th - floor office overlooking Times Square , it has reportedly earned more than $ 100 million in the past six years .
That office is a cheery one , filled with sports mementos ( a wooden seat from the old Yankee Stadium , a football signed by Jets legend Joe Namath ) , the accoutrements of the ex-mayor ’s passions ( among them a beautiful wooden humidor for expensive cigars ) , and , on almost every flat surface , silver - framed photographs of his 53 - year - old third wife , Judith Nathan .
On his wooden desk sits a little sign with the inscription i’m responsible .
It was here , over these last six years , that Giuliani placed calls to make things happen for his clients — many of them engaged in some aspect of the security industry that boomed as a direct result of 9/11 .
These days Giuliani ’s office sits mostly empty as he canvasses the country for money and votes in his bid to become the Republican nominee for president in 2008 .
Is he even still working for Giuliani Partners ?
It ’s a relevant question , because if he is n’t — and , really , how could he be in these busy weeks of campaigning before the first Republican presidential primaries ?— then he should n’t be drawing a salary from the firm .
According to a former top Federal Election Commission official , that would be a breach of election law : the firm would in effect be making undeclared campaign contributions .
The answer , from Giuliani Partners C.E.O.
Mike Hess , is that “ Rudy is no longer involved in the day - to - day operations of Giuliani Partners .
He maintains his ownership interest . ”
To the point of whether Giuliani is still earning money from Giuliani Partners , the answer seems a bit delphic , especially after a Washington Post article from October 30 , in which Giuliani Partners spokeswoman Sunny Mindel described Giuliani as still working part - time for the company .
To anyone who has followed Giuliani ’s meteoric rise in business , that dodge is unsurprising .
There are , it seems , at least two Rudolph Giulianis .
One is the crusading former U.S. attorney and 9/11 - bedecked ex-mayor of New York , cloaked in the six core values prominently featured on Giuliani Partners ’
Web site : Integrity .
Optimism .
Courage .
Preparedness .
Communication .
Accountability .
The other Rudy Giuliani is the one who has brazenly built a business on his 9/11 fame .
Some of his clients have been large , established companies , such as Aon , the global risk - management firm that lost 175 people in the World Trade Center attack ; Entergy , which operates nuclear power plants ; and Delta Airlines and U.S. Airways .
But a number have been scrappy little penny - stock start - ups , one of them backed by an S.E.C. - disciplined stock swindler .
These are the players who have needed Giuliani most , to promote them , to open doors for them in government or business , or merely to lend them his name , at a very high price , so they can boost their stock or get bought by bigger fish .
In doing business with these companies , Giuliani has sometimes created at least an appearance of poor judgment , or greed , or both .
But if the crusading ex–U.S. attorney understands the importance of appearances , the other Rudy Giuliani seems oblivious to them .
Richard Doherty , research director of the Envisioneering Group , a market research firm , said Netflix ’s model had the virtue of being free to existing subscribers and relatively easy for consumers to understand .
“ You ’re already a subscriber and you do n’t pay anything extra .
That ’s called a slam dunk in most businesses we follow , ” Mr. Doherty said .
The companies said LG products with Netflix ’s movie service would begin shipping in the second half of this year .
They did not say which devices would have it .
Mr. Doherty , who was briefed on the Netflix announcement and LG ’s other plans to be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week , said LG could integrate the Netflix service into a future version of its dual - mode HD DVD / Blu-ray DVD player , which now sells for $ 799 , and a new line of high - definition TVs with wireless connections to the Internet , among other products .
Mr. Hastings said the new service would combine the benefits of an Internet browser with the luxury of watching movies and TV shows on large , high - definition TV screens .
He said subscribers would be able to go to the Netflix Web site to create lists of movies they wanted to see .
The Netflix service on the TV would offer a simple way to watch those movies .
“ We think we have solved the real fundamental problem , which has been that choosing movies on a television has been extremely challenging , ” Mr. Hastings said .
“ Video - on - demand companies worked at it for a long time , but choosing movies on the TV just does n’t have the power of the Web . ”
The Netflix streams will not initially be in high definition , and there are some limits to how many programs customers can watch .
For example , customers who pay Netflix ’s most popular $ 17 - a - month rate are allowed 17 hours of viewing on their PCs , though a spokesman said the company had been experimenting with unlimited digital viewing .
Netflix says it is able to offer the online service free to subscribers because when customers watch online , the company does not have to spend the money to mail them a DVD .
MORE children are surviving beyond their fifth birthday , according to a new report from the United Nations Children 's Fund ( Unicef ) .
The child mortality rate — the number of under - fives dying per thousand live births — dropped by almost a quarter worldwide between 1990 and 2006 .
The rate fell by around a half in Latin America , central Europe and the former Soviet Union , and East Asia .
Progress in sub-Saharan Africa , where the death rate is highest , has been slower .
Around one in six children in the region still die before the age of five and the rate is rising in some countries .
Pneumonia , diarrhoeal diseases and malaria together account for more than two - fifths of child deaths .

New York Times bestselling author Steve Alten is releasing a novel January 22nd which addresses the 9/11 stand down , the injection of false radar blips into air traffic controllers ' screens , PNAC , the 9/11 Commission whitewash , the Anthrax attacks , and related issues .
Written in the exciting , cloak - and - dagger style of Tom Clancy , the novel -- The Shell Game -- has a shot at educating a large segment of the American public who would otherwise remain in the dark about some aspects of 9/11 .
Alten is well - aware of media censorship of 9/11 truth ( for example , he agrees with this analysis , he also sent me an advance copy of the book ) , and is trying to break through the media blockade using his resume as bestselling author to spread his message .
I just finished reading The Shell Game , and caught up with Alten by email .
GW : I really like The Shell Game , Steve .
It had me on the edge of my seat , and I stayed up later than I should have a couple of nights to finish it .
SA : My books tend to be ... page - turners .
The Shell Game does that and adds another twist ... it 's all real , or it predicts what may really happen unless we stop the insanity .
To stop it you must first be aware of it .
GW : If enough people read The Shell Game , it could bypass media censorship regarding 9/11 and reach people who would otherwise not be exposed to the facts .
But if it does n't sell well , then it will simply be an entertaining read for those already aware of the facts behind 9/11 .
So how are your efforts to promote The Shell Game going ?
SA : We 've been getting copies into the hands of key 9/11 groups over the last six months .
Now it 's up to them to create a buzz ... along with my mainstream fans .
GW : The Shell Game reads like a mix of Tom Clancy , Robert Ludlum and Dan Brown .
Are those 3 authors all influences on your writing ?
SA : Clancy , Thomas Harris , Ian Fleming ... among others .
GW : Your discussions about 9/11 will be familiar to those who have studied the issue .
In addition to Michael Ruppert 's Crossing the Rubicon and David Ray Griffin 's writings , what other 9/11 writings do you like ?
SA : 9/11 Truth.org .
And videos like Loose Change .
GW : My father - in - law says that people predicted Peak Oil decades ago , and were proven wrong .
Does the discovery of the massive new oil reserve in Brazil change your conviction that Peak Oil is upon us ?
SA : Unless it is as big as Ghawar ... no .
Oil IS running out .
If not , do you seriously believe we'd have invaded Iraq ?
GW : I 've heard before that many of the world 's top microbiologists have been killed under suspicious circumstances , but I 've never heard anyone link their deaths to an alleged plot to reduce world population through biological warfare .
That was the scariest part of the book for me .
Do you have any evidence that the elites are really planning a massive depopulation of this kind ?
SA : Read Rubicon and extrapolate Peak Oil .
GW : Well , I hope you 're wrong .
In any event , thanks , Steve .
I hope the book does well .
SA : With your help it will ... for all of us .

NEW YORK : Microsoft Corp. made its broadest challenge to date against open - source software , including Windows rival Linux , claiming that such programs violate 235 Microsoft patents and saying it will seek licence fees .
The world 's largest software maker said that various open - source packages violate patents it holds in areas related to graphical user interface , e-mail programs and other technology .
" The real question is not whether there exist substantial patent infringement issues , but what to do about them , " said Horacio Gutierrez , Microsoft vice president of intellectual property and licensing in a statement .
Microsoft sent the statement to reporters on Monday via e-mail , detailing a stance that it disclosed in an article that appeared in Fortune Magazine .
Linux is the most popular type of open - source software , or computer programs that developers can download and modify as long as they share those changes with the public .
The packages , which are often available for free , have gained in popularity over the past decade , taking market share away from Microsoft .
While dozens of versions of the Linux operating system are available for free download , Red Hat Inc. and Novell Inc. develop and sell versions of Linux used to run servers and mainframe computers in corporate data centers .
Last year Microsoft signed a marketing , technology and patent agreement with Novell , saying it wants to enter into similar pacts with other open - source software companies .
That agreement , which includes a clause that Microsoft will not sue Novell 's Linux customers , incensed the community of open - source software developers , because they said Microsoft would use it to back claims that its intellectual property is being violated by code in Linux and other open source software .
Eben Moglen , founding director of the Software Freedom Law Center , called on Microsoft to disclose the patent numbers of the 235 patents it believes are being infringed upon so that the free software community can evaluate its claims .
" They should name their patents , " Moglen said .
" They should put up or shut up . "
The Software Freedom Law Center is a nonprofit legal services organization that provides free legal aid to developers of open - source software .
Officials with Red Hat could n't be reached for comment .
A Novell spokesman issued a statement saying that his company does not " agree or admit " that Linux violates Microsoft patents , but that the agreement between the two companies " takes the patent issue off the table for those customers who are concerned about it . "
In its statement on the issue , Microsoft played up its partnership with Novell , saying that customers worried about intellectual property claims should buy their Linux software from Novell .
Red Hat shares fell 35 cents to $ 22.14 in afternoon Nasdaq trade .
Novell shares rose 11 cents to $ 7.65 on the New York Stock Exchange and Microsoft shares rose 18 cents at $ 31.05 on the Nasdaq .
Normalcy is a recurring , and intentional , theme of the FCX Clarity .
It is refueled using a high - pressure connector tucked behind a typical gas - cap door on the rear fender .
It has a handsome exterior , a nice audio system and plenty of knee room in the back .
( A design analysis is at nytimes.com /autos )
Anyone who has driven a Toyota Prius will feel at home with the dash - mounted gear selector and the park button .
Honda has not announced who will get the FCX Claritys or how many will be available in Southern California , where the program begins .
Households will be selected , in part , for their ready access to hydrogen stations .
Honda is realistic about the slow growth of a hydrogen infrastructure as well as the viewpoint that fuel cells may not seem to make much sense using current methods of hydrogen production .
But there are practical matters to consider as well : compared with alternatives like plug - in hybrids , the onboard energy supply is quicker to replenish and has a better travel range , 270 miles .
Moreover , in Honda ’s full - cycle calculation , a fuel - cell vehicle can reduce carbon dioxide output by half compared with a gasoline vehicle .
In the United States , where much electricity is produced from coal , it is even better than a battery - electric car , Honda says .
It will be a while before drivers selected for the three - year , $ 600 - a- month Clarity lease program ( it includes insurance and maintenance ) will think about such topics .
Instead , they will revel in its extraordinary silence .
It drives away from a stop so quietly that it seems to be holding its breath , much as a hybrid does before the gas engine starts .
Accelerating onto Interstate 10 , though , incites a turbinelike zing  quite pleasant , really , if not as satisfying as the guttural bark of a V - 8  and the Clarity blends effortlessly into traffic .
The sound of a pump at work breaks the silence occasionally , but it has none of the clicking and whirring evident in the previous - generation FCX .
Image Seats in the FCX Clarity include fans to heat and warm occupants , reducing the energy drain of the climate - control system .
Concave interior surfaces add to a sense of spaciousness .
Honda says the performance is on par with a similar - size car powered by a 2.4 - liter engine , and it should know , as the 2008 Accord LX has just such an engine .
The comparison is apt .
The FCX motor produces 134 horsepower and 189 pound - feet of torque ; the Accord ’s in - line four makes 177 horsepower and 161 pound - feet .
The Clarity weighs nearly 3,600 pounds , and while that is 400 pounds lighter than its predecessor , the Accord is some 300 pounds lighter yet .
The wheelbases of the Clarity and Accord are identical at 110.2 inches .
If the president does it , it ’s not illegal
In recent years , as a result of a variety of jaw - dropping scandals , officials at the Bush White House has made it clear that they believe the president has the authority to decide for himself whether his own conduct is constitutional .
Forget the judiciary , checks and balances , co-equal branches , etc. — Nixon once said , “ [ W ] hen the president does it , that means that it is not illegal , ” and this president seems to take that maxim to heart .
That said , neither Bush nor his aides go around explicitly making that argument .
Instead , they do it in their lawyer ’s office .
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - R.I. ) , a former U.S. Attorney and state Attorney General , took it upon himself to use his position on the Senate Intelligence Committee to pore over secret opinions issued by the Department of Justice ’s Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) , which , among other things , justified the administration ’s warrantless wiretap program .
After taking assiduous notes , Whitehouse announced this morning he needed to show the public “ what the Bush administration does behind our backs when they think no one is looking . ”
Specifically , he found three legal propositions used by Bush ’s OLC .
1 . An executive order cannot limit a President .
There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order .
Rather than violate an executive order , the President has instead modified or waived it .
2 . The President , exercising his constitutional authority under Article II , can determine whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President ’s authority under Article II .
3 . The Department of Justice is bound by the President ’s legal determinations .
Yeah , it ’s that bad .
Marcy
Wheeler has a really good post on this , with extended excerpts from Whitehouse ’s speech , but I found this portion of his remarks particularly striking :
“ The President , according to the George W. Bush OLC , has Article II power to determine what the scope of his Article II powers are .
“ Never mind a little decision called Marbury v. Madison , written by Chief Justice John Marshall in 1803 , establishing the proposition that it is ’emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is . ’
Does this administration agree that it is emphatically the province and the duty of the judicial department to say what the President ’s authority is under Article II ?
No , it is the President , according to this OLC , who decides the legal limits of his own Article II power .
“ The question ‘ whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President ’s authority under Article II , ’ is to be determined by the President ’s minions , ‘ exercising his constitutional authority under Article II . ’
“ It really makes you wonder , who are these people ?
They have got to be smart people to get there .
How can people who are so smart be so misguided ?
“ And then , it gets worse .
Remember point three : ‘ The Department of Justice is bound by the President ’s legal determinations . ’
Let that sink in a minute .
‘ The Department of Justice is bound by the President ’s legal determinations . ’
“ We are a nation of laws , not of men .
This nation was founded in rejection of the royalist principles that ‘ l ’etat c’est moi’ and ‘ The King can do no wrong . ’
Our Attorney General swears an oath to defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States ; we are not some banana republic in which the officials all have to kowtow to the ‘ supreme leader . ’
Imagine a general counsel to a major U.S. corporation telling his board of directors , ‘ in this company the counsel ’s office is bound by the CEO ’s legal determinations . ’
The board ought to throw that lawyer out – it ’s malpractice , probably even unethical .
“ Wherever you are , if you are watching this , do me a favor .
The next time you are in Washington , D.C. , take a taxi some evening to the Department of Justice .
Stand outside , and look up at that building shining against the starry night .
Look at the sign outside - “ The United States Department of Justice . ”
Think of the heroes who have served there , and the battles fought .
Think of the late nights , the brave decisions , the hard work of advancing and protecting our democracy that has been done in those halls .
Think about how that all makes you feel .
“ Then think about this statement : ‘ The Department of Justice is bound by the President ’s legal determinations . ’
“ If you do n’t feel a difference from what you were feeling a moment ago , well , congratulations – there is probably a job for you in the Bush administration . ”
Andrew Sullivan , noting Whitehouse ’s conclusions , said , “ Every time you think you ’re hallucinating about the powers this president has accrued to himself , you come across a reality more surreal . ”
I know exactly how he feels .
National greeting card company carrying ' Love Democratic style ' card with Pelosi , others in bondage
This Valentine 's Day , one of the nation 's largest greeting card companies is circulating a satirical online greeting card that depicts " Love Democratic Style " as " throw[ing ] family values out the window " and depicts House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) dressed as a dominatrix and Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) as a maid .
RAW STORY could not locate a similar " Love Republican Style " card at the company 's website .
Shots from Blue Mountain 's greeting card are shown below .
The short eCard from the company plays a jingle for about 30 seconds with a variety of colorful images of Democratic political leaders in compromising situations .
The eCard first depicts an image of Senator Hillary Clinton dressed in maid garb .
It then proceeds to show former Governor Howard Dean and Senator John Kerry both wearing dog collars :
Several Democratic ' newbies ' are then shown :
A photograph of Majority Leader Senator Harry Reid follows with his face beneath a high heel , and the declaration that family values have been thrown " out the window " :
An image of bondage gear is then shown , with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi then depicted in a dominatrix outfit while the associated jingle declares that " Love is free with Pelosi " :
The greeting card ends by wishing a " Happy VD " :
RAW STORY was awaiting comment from Democratic offices and American Greetings Interactive , the company that owns Blue Mountain , at press time .
AGInteractive is owned by American Greetings , which says on its website that it is " one of the world 's largest manufacturers of social expression products . "
The eCard can be accessed at Blue Mountain 's website .
Adm Mullen has expressed doubts over the war in Iraq
At his swearing - in ceremony as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Michael Mullen said he wants to revitalise the armed forces .
Meanwhile , the FBI is to investigate US security firm Blackwater over the deaths of 11 Iraqis last month .
US politicians are also to question the company 's chairman about the incident .
Iraq war doubts
At a ceremony at Ft Myer , Virginia , presided over by President Bush , Admiral Mullen said : " The fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan will one day end .
" We must be ready for who and what comes after . "
Adm Mullen takes over from Gen Peter Pace .
BLACKWATER USA FACTS
Founded in 1997 by a former US Navy Seal Headquarters in North Carolina
One of at least 28 private security companies in Iraq Employs 744 US citizens , 231 third - country nationals , and 12 Iraqis to protect US state department in Iraq Provided protection for former CPA head Paul Bremer Four employees killed by mob in Falluja in March 2004
Profile : Blackwater USA
Impunity under scrutiny
He said he wants to plan to support US interests in the Middle East and " to reset , reconstitute and revitalise our armed forces , especially our ground forces " .
Some military officials have said the focus on counter - insurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan has left the military unprepared for other types of operations .
Admiral Mullen has openly expressed doubts over the war in Iraq .
His swearing - in came as the FBI confirmed it is to send a team of investigators to Iraq to look into Blackwater 's role in the shooting deaths of 11 Iraqi civilians in September .
The Iraqi government says Blackwater agents opened fire without provocation .
The company says insurgents attacked first .
In Washington on Tuesday , a Congressional committee is to question the firm 's chairman , Erik Prince , as part of a hearing into the role of private security firms in Iraq .
A report by the US Congress reveals the company fired 122 people in three years for problems ranging from violent behaviour to drug use .
The report says Blackwater employees were involved 195 shooting incidents in Iraq from the beginning of 2005 until 12 September this year , causing 16 Iraqi casualties .
The report does not say how many of these were deaths .
There is concern about how private security firms , especially Blackwater , operate in Iraq .
Over 181,000 people joined the U.S. military during the fiscal 2007 recruiting year .
This is more than joined the military during fiscal years 2006 and 2005 .
All four of the services met or exceeded their recruiting goals for 2007 , as did four of the six reserve components .
Why ?
Why are all these people joining the military ?
Why , in spite of multiple duty tours , ever - increasing deployment terms , an increase in sexual assaults , post - traumatic stress disorder , the breakup of military families , and the suicide rate , and almost daily reports of U.S. military personnel being killed or maimed in Iraq , are so many men and women joining the military ?
It could have something to do with the military :
Spending over $ 4 billion a year on recruiting
Raising the maximum enlistment age
Accepting lower entrance scores on aptitude tests
Granting more medical waivers
Giving more moral waivers
Permitting ex-convicts to enlist
Relaxing the physical fitness requirements
Loosening weight restrictions
Allowing non-citizens to gain their citizenship after one year of active duty
But it could also have to do with the military :
Giving enlistment bonuses
Providing tuition assistance
Granting educational allowances
Assisting with student loan repayment
Offering assignment incentive pay
Then there is the career training , the world travel , the thirty days of vacation every year , and the free medical and dental care .
And who can forget the GI Bill , VA loans , and the generous retirement benefits .
After the September 11th terrorist attacks , many people joined the military because they believed the president when he said : “ Freedom was attacked , freedom will be defended . ”
Others , ignorant of the blowback we reaped after decades of an interventionist foreign policy , joined the military because they thought they were actually going to take part in defending the United States against unjust aggression .
Some actually supposed that by joining the military they were participating in a religious crusade against Islamofacism .
But what about now ?
After almost five years of needless destruction , senseless deaths , and billions of wasted dollars , after all the lies of the Bush administration have been exposed , after the principle of “ blowback ” has been thoroughly explained and proved , after the genocide that the Iraq War has become — why do American men and women continue to join the U.S. military ?
There are some things that they know .
They know that they may be put in harm ’s way .
They know that being deployed will take a toll on their family .
They know that they may be put into a situation where they will have to kill or be killed .
They know that there is no end in sight to the war .
There are also some things that they may not know but should .
They should know that many generals with much more military knowledge and experience than any recruiter they know have denounced this war .
They should know that by joining the military they are helping to carry out the foreign policy of an evil empire that stirs up strife and creates terrorists .
They should know that the military does very little to actually defend the country .
They should know that if they die fighting in Iraq that it will be for a lie .
So why do thousands of people continue to join the military ?
In most cases , the decision is a financial one — just like the decision to sell crack or become a prostitute .
But until joining the military receives the same stigma as those activities , enlistments will continue .
Because we are in the middle of an unpopular war , because there is no draft , and because the majority of people who join today ’s military do so for financial reasons , the conclusion is inescapable :
They are mercenaries , they are contract killers — they are killers for hire .

Here are analogues of sum , product , and exponentiation for lists .
Each takes two lists of values , of types a and b , and forms the list of all values of sum , product , and function ( exponent ) types .
The first two of these are already built - in to Haskell , in the form of append and list - comprehensions .
The third is also quite useful , and I suggest it should be added to the standard List module .
For example , if you want to form a truth table for the list of variables in names , your can do so using [ True , False ] ^^^names to form all 2^n mappings of names to truth variables ( where n is the length of names ) .
In case you doubt whether these actually correspond to sum , product , and exponentiation , here are Peano 's definitions :
And here are the above operations , rewritten to correspond to Peano 's definitions :

This article is an attempt to apply the Hybrid Shock Model ( HSM ) on Saudi Arabia 's oil production .
In a nutshell , the HSM is trying to model the observed production profile from the discovery curve by simulating the different phases involved in the development of oilfields ( initial discovery , planning , build , maturity ) .
The HSM is a variant of the Shock Model initially proposed by WebHubbleTelescope .
One of the byproduct of the HSM is the instantaneous reserve addition ( noted ) .
I based the following work on the assumption that the value forshould be somewhat close to available proven reserve figures .
Of course , for Saudi Arabia available proven reserves are highly suspicious because of huge overnight reserve increase among OPEC members in the 80s without any new discoveries .
Therefore , I will consider three increasingly conservative proven reserve hypothesis : 1 ) PR1 : the official numbers as published by BP ; 2 ) PR2 : spurious increase are removed ; 3 ) PR3 : as proposed by Euan here , cumulative production is also removed .
The volume of recoverable oil from Ghawar is then inferred from the HSM based on the discovery curve from IHS as the value that is minimizing the error between proven reserves and simulated reserve additions .
My conclusions are the following :

PR3 : Official proven reserves corrected for anomalous reserve increase and cumulative production as proposed by Euan here .
Model Inference
In addition to Ghawar size , the main parameter of the HSM is the λ parameter which is the sum of the three individual λ associated with each oil production cycle ( i.e. λ=λ build + λ fallow + λ mature ) .
This parameter is controling the shift between the backdated discovery curve and the actual reserve additions ready to be produced ( see blue and green curves on Figure 5 ) .
A small λ value means that new discoveries are immediately developped and new supply is coming online very rapidly .
Conversly , a large value means that new discoveries are taking a long time to be brought online and reserve additions will be small and spread over a long period of time .
For the case of Saudi Arabia , it is difficult to put a prior on λ values , we can expect a fairly large value because of the harsh environment and the size of the projects ( e.g. Haradth development in three phases took nearly ten years ( build phase ) for a production capacity of 900 kbpd ) .
Values for Ghawar size were taken between 50 and 150 Gb and λ between 1 and 24 years , it results in the following RMS surface :
Fig 3 . Minimum prediction error surfaces for reserve numbers as a function of Ghawar size and λ under the three proven reserve hypothesis considered .
We can observe a nice valley of low RMS values for PR2 and a minimum for λ=21 years and Ghawar URR at 109 Gb .
The error surfaces are further summarized on the chart below by taking the minimum error value along the λ axis .
We can see that the PR2 hypothesis generates the smallest error values across all the parameter space .
In order to reach the same error level , the PR1 hypothesis would require an impossibly high value for Ghawar ( ~200 Gb ) and lambda ( λ> 40 years ) and PR3 a very small value ( ~30 Gb ) and λ ~1 year .
A confidence interval can be roughly estimated by taking the values corresponding to 90 % of the minimum error which gives 109 ± 10 Gb .

What 's left to be discovered ?
The USGS noted a potential of 136 billion barrels of conventional oil + NGL to be discovered between 1996 and 2030 in Saudi Arabia ( 9 % of the total of 939 billion barrels ) .
Between 1 January 1996 and 1 January 2006 approximately 5 billion barrels have been discovered in Saudi Arabia .
Since the nationalisation in the ' 70s foreign companies could not drill in the country .
Only since 2004 have several western oil companies have been allowed to drill for gas in the Rub Al Khali Region ( empty quarter ) , which is positioned in the south and south / west .
In Summary
The most likely range for Ghawar is 109 ± 10 Gb which is close to Euan Mearns 's estimate .
Among the three proven reserve scenarios , the PR2 ( i.e. corrected for spurious reserve jumps ) is the most likely .
The official proven reserves seem to imply that Ghawar is around 200 Gb with a very high value for the mean production lag time ( λ > 40 years ) .

Proven Reserves Ghawar size ( Gb ) Non Ghawar resource base ( Gb ) YTF ( >2006 ) URR ( Gb ) PR1 ( 264 Gb ) ~200 190 8-21 402 PR2 ( 174 Gb ) 109 ± 10 313 ± 17 PR3 ( 91 Gb ) ~30 232
The URR is forecasted to be around 313 Gb assuming that all the small fields will be developped ( field size cutoff at 0 ) .
However , if we assume that only fields above 1
Gb will be developped , we get an effective URR around 290 Gb .
The chart below is summarizing different forecasts ( it is an updated version of Euan's

The HSM applied on the total production ( Figure 5 ) does not show any decline in production capacity before 2015 - 2016 with a maximum capacity at 11.5 ± 0.25 mbpd .
The two stages production modeling where Ghawar is modeled separalely ( Figure 8 ) is a little bit less optimistic and shows a decline in production between 2010 and 2013 with a maximum at 10.5 ± 0.5 mbpd .
The model does not support

However , if we assume that only fields above 1
Gb will be developped , we get an effective URR around 290 Gb .
The chart below is summarizing different forecasts ( it is an updated version of Euan 's chart ) .
The HSM is a little bit higher than Campbell which is for crude oil + condensate ( C+C ) only .
The HSM applied on the total production ( Figure 5 ) does not show any decline in production capacity before 2015 - 2016 with a maximum capacity at 11.5 ± 0.25 mbpd .
The two stages production modeling where Ghawar is modeled separalely ( Figure 8 ) is a little bit less optimistic and shows a decline in production between 2010 and 2013 with a maximum at 10.5 ± 0.5 mbpd .
The model does not support claims that production capacity could go beyond 12 - 15 mbpd however it seems to indicate that production could be maintained around 10 mbpd for a long period of time .
I find it intriguing that the HSM is confirming values derived from other orthogonal methodologies and seems to put together nicely different pieces of the puzzle ( i.e. Ghawar size , corrected proven reserves and Saudi Arabia discovery data ) .
Note that an eventual reserve growth contribution has not been taken into account in this work .
Complete and accurate discovery data for Saudi Arabia is impossible to obtain .
However , because Saudi Production is coming from a handful of giants and super - giants ( Saudi Arabia has only about 80 oil fields ) , we can reconstruct a rough discovery dataset .
The size estimates for the top 12 fields are shown on Figure 1 .
In addition , I will use an oil discovery dataset presumably from IHS ( believed to be for crude oil + condensate + NGL ) and kindly provided by Rembrandt Koppelaar and shown on the figure below .
Ghawar is 120 Gb and the total resource base is 309 Gb in 2005 .
I will consider three cases for the proven reserves ( a high case , a middle case and a low case ) :
We are trying to answer the following question :
What is the more likely value for Ghawar ultimate recoverable oil volume according to the Hybrid Shock Model ?
In order to answer that question , we will consider Ghawar size as a parameter of the model .
The quality of the match between predicted reserves and actual reserve values under the different scenarios will be our measure of likelihood of our model parameters .
The corresponding HSM production capacity forecast is given on the Figure below and is fairly more optimistic than Euan 's forecast for instance .
The URR assuming no new discoveries is around 300 Gb ( crude oil + NGL ) and no decline in production capacity is seen before 2015 .
Because Ghawar is such a dominant ( and old ) feature of Saudi Arabia production , I will model separately the contribution from Ghawar ( as a logistic decline as explained in a previous post ) and the contributions from the other fields .
We can see on Figure 6 , that the contribution from giant fields is overwhelming .
and amounts to about 170 Gb of the 190 Gb of non Ghawar total discovery volume .
It 's obvious that not all the small discoveries will be developped .
Therefore , in order to simulate the non Ghawar production , I considered two cutoff values for the discovery size : 1 Gb and 5 Gb .
This result in two different forecasts for the non Ghawar production ( green and blue lines on Figure 7 ) .
The result of the two stage modeling is shown on Figure 8 below ( top or left chart ) .
Compare to the previous result , we get almost a flat production line with a decline starting between 2010 and 2012 .
Volumes of new discoveries have been anemic since the 80s and there is no reason to believe that this trend will change in the future despite speculations that significant fields are waiting under the empty quarter .
I quote Rembdrandt Based on the IHS discovery profile for the years 1981 to 2005 and using a boostrap technique , we can expect the annual discovery rate to be between 0.32 and 0.81 Gb per year ( 95 % confidence interval ) which amounts to a total of 8 - 21 Gb of Yet - To - be - Find between 2006 and 2030 .
We proposed to apply the Hybrid Shock Model in order to retrieve the most likely Ghawar size value under different proven reserve scenarios :
The various Ghawar size estimates are shown on Figure 9 below .
The median value is 98 Gb and the MAD estimator gives 22 Gb , consequently the 95 % confidence interval is 76 - 120 Gb .
The table below is summarizing the different results :

WASHINGTON —
If a candidate for any office ran on a promise to render government dysfunctional — to destroy its capacity to work on behalf of something roughly considered to be the common good , to assure that bitter division and not even a grudging tilt toward compromise would prevail — it is reasonable to assume that voters would recoil .
This would surely be true if the office - seeker aspired to a seat on the local sewer commission .
President Bush did not run for the White House on such a platform .
But it is how he has governed , and how he seems to see his role — now more than ever .
The predisposition has grown since the Democrats won control of Congress , an event that might have punctured the bubble of disinformation around Bush , but which seems only to have reinforced it .
The crisis now at hand , besides Iraq , is how to finance the most basic operations of the federal government .
It is a manufactured impasse , since Congress has actually made quicker progress in approving routine spending bills this year than in most .
The House already has passed its dozen appropriations bills .
This compares with none — zero — passed when Republicans led the chamber last year .
When the Democrats began running the House in January , their first cleanup chore was completing that leftover task .
The more deliberate Senate has passed four spending measures .
This incomplete record is one reason Congress must pass one of those “ continuing resolutions ” that always seem to the public to symbolize political indolence .
But this bit of housekeeping to keep the government operating after Oct. 1 should n’t be confused with the more significant reason a budget crisis is brewing — the reason there is the potential to repeat the infamous government shutdown of 1995 .
Bush , having declined to veto a single spending measure when Republicans controlled Congress , says he wants to veto just about all of them now .
It is perhaps too near the twilight of his presidency to call Bush on this latest hypocrisy — and anyway , the repetition is tiresome .
Better to illuminate the picayune nature of the fight Bush picks .
The dispute is over a total — spread among all the spending bills — of $ 22 billion that Bush himself did not call for .
That amounts to about 2 percent of federal spending that is subject to annual appropriations by Congress .
How else to put it in perspective ?
Military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are costing nearly $ 10 billion every month .
The president ’s point is n’t to force negotiations over a piddling sum .
It ’s to fake out the public so that it believes Democrats can’t perform basic governmental tasks .
Having already failed to bring an end to the Iraq crisis — because the president and his remaining Republican allies on Capitol Hill wo n’t allow it —
Democrats are now to stand accused of botching the budget , too .
A second goal is to rally the Republican conservative “ base ” before next year ’s elections .
A third is more cynical :
The pox - on - both - their - houses story line that typically accompanies budget showdowns turns off independent voters .
Still , many Republicans are increasingly isolated from their president .
The four spending measures so far passed in the Senate have overwhelming bipartisan support .
The tallies : homeland security , 89 - 4 ; military construction and veterans , 92 - 1 ; State Department and foreign operations , 81 - 12 ; transportation and housing , 88 - 7 .
The House spending bills also drew bipartisan support , with an average of more than 50 Republican votes , according to an analysis by the Appropriations Committee staff .
But generally speaking , there wo n’t have been enough Republican votes to override Bush ’s expected vetoes .
Once again , House Republicans will control the outcome , irrespective of their losses last November .
The fakery was best expressed by Bush , who last week gave himself the grade of “ A ” for “ keeping taxes low and being fiscally responsible with the people ’s money . ”
It so happens that on Bush ’s watch — and with Republicans in control of Capitol HiIl — the federal budget swung from an anticipated 10 - year surplus of $ 5.6 trillion to an expected deficit of $ 2.8 trillion .
This reversal of fiscal fortune has swelled the debt and driven the annual cost of interest on it to $ 261 billion in fiscal 2008 , more than 10 times the amount that is to be so hotly disputed this fall .
The numbers will not matter because the point is to show that Democrats cannot win for having won .
This may be the only strategy Bush sees .
But it ’s no way to run a sewer commission .

The teenager faces charges under the Terrorism Act 2000
The 17 - year - old , who was arrested in the Dewsbury area of West Yorkshire on Monday , was given bail after a hearing at Westminster Magistrates ' Court .
It is alleged he had a copy of the " Anarchists ' Cookbook " , containing instructions on how to make home - made explosives .
His next court hearing has been set for 25 October .
The teenager faces two charges under the Terrorism Act 2000 .
The first charge relates to the possession of material for terrorist purposes in October last year .
The second relates to the collection or possession of information useful in the preparation of an act of terrorism .
He stood in the dock wearing a baggy , blue hooded top and only spoke to confirm his name and date of birth .
After the 40 - minute hearing , the teenager was released on bail under several conditions .
A second 17 - year - old who is facing similar charges has already been remanded in custody and will also appear at the Crown Court on 25 October .
Former White House Counsel Harriet Miers defied a Congressional subpoena last week and Congress is considering charging her with contempt of Congress .
As we find out on Monday 's " Countdown , " if the DoJ does not uphold a contempt charge it is believed they will circumvent Alberto Gonzales and charge Miers with Inherent Contempt .
According to Jonathan Turley , if charged with Inherent Contempt , Miers would be arrested by the Sergeant - At - Arms , frog marched directly to Congress and tried on the spot .

On the topic of the Bush Administration 's grotesque and unforgivable handling and cover up of Pat Tillman 's death , Turley is as animated as I 've ever seen him .
He , like most Americans , is shocked at how the president has tortured Tillman 's family by stonewalling the investigation .
Stephanie Fessler does n’t drive a hybrid car , compost her orange peels or bring her own reusable cloth bags to the supermarket .
But two months ago , Fessler joined countless other businesspeople in doing one environmental good deed daily .
At the bottom of every e-mail she sends , she includes this message : “ Save Trees .
Print only when necessary . ”
“ This is something I can contribute in my crazy busy life , ” said Fessler , 29 , who works for a Los Angeles public relations firm .
“ It reminds other people about environmental awareness and reminds me on a daily basis . ”
The trend took off in March , when the popular environmental website TreeHugger.com encouraged readers to add the don’t - print plea to their automatic e-mail signatures .
Advertisement
Since then , the message has spread beyond the granola - and - Birkenstock crowd to the cubicle armies of corporate America .
Architects , airline employees and even button - down accountants have gotten in on the act , as have companies such as media giant News Corp .
The parent of Fox Television offers employees a catchy admonition that riffs on the company ’s “ Cool Change ” environmental initiative : “ Be cool , consider the environment .
Please do n’t print this e-mail unless you really need to . ”
At Bovis Lend Lease , a 10,000 - person worldwide project management and construction company , so many employees began adopting the please - don ’t - print line that executives agreed to grant a sole exception to the company ’s rule against personalized e-mail signatures .
And as many as 1,000 accountants and consultants at Deloitte & Touche have adopted some version of the line , one executive said .
“ It ’s a testament to how cool green is that this particular message is appearing in so many business communications , ” said John Palfrey , executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School .

Environmentalists say the don’t - print message has genuine merit .
Despite 20th century predictions of a paperless office , Americans use enough sheets every year to build a 10 - foot - high wall that would stretch from New York to Tokyo and beyond , according to GreenPrint Technologies , which sells software to eliminate unnecessary pages before printing .
At the same time , an estimated 97 billion e-mails whisk through cyberspace every day .
Technology trackers say more e-mails invariably mean more printouts , if for no other reason than that printing has become a habit .
Last year , 53 % of people surveyed told research firm IDC that they printed more because of e-mail .
That means more paper , and more energy to shred or recycle it .
The growing mountains of printed pages encouraged Michael Graham Richard , TreeHugger.com ’s editor , to get behind the please - don ’t - print movement after he saw the auto - signature for the first time last winter .
“ We all know that many people print e-mails for no good reason , wasting tons of paper , ” Richard wrote on the site in March .
“ Let ’s do something about it , dear reader .
. . .
Add the following lines to your e-mail signature : ‘ Eco -Tip : Printing e-mails is usually a waste .
Make this tip go viral , add it to your e-mail signature . ’ ”
Advertisement
To some , the various incarnations of “ please do n’t print this ” -- personalized with clever witticisms or written in bold green text alongside a picture of a tree -- are a new , socially responsible form of viral marketing .
To others , the tips are an empty , greener - than - thou finger wag .
“ You ’re saving a landfill by not using more paper -- not saving the planet , ” said Jake Munsey , an executive at Fox Cable Networks ’
Fuel TV who has stopped using the eco-tip .
“ I started thinking , ‘ What really is this going to change ? ’ ”
Rob Guglielmetti , a lighting designer , blogger and committed , ride - his - bike - to - work - every - day environmentalist , said as much to his boss a few months ago when the supervisor suggested using the enviro - missive on all outgoing company e-mails .
Advertisement
“ People get this kind of smug satisfaction about how green they are -- ‘ Hey , look at me , look at how great we are , we as a company are trying to teach you about sustainability and saving trees and saving the planet , ’ ” said Guglielmetti , who lives in Boulder , Colo .
On his blog , Rumblestrip.org , Guglielmetti offered a sarcastic list of alternative green e-mail signatures , including , “ Printing this message kills trees .
Print is murder ! ”
“ I do n’t think clients need to be addressed in that manner during their workday , ” Guglielmetti said .
“ They do n’t need to hear a personal message about the environment .
It has more of a place in a personal e-mail than a business e-mail . ”
TreeHugger ’s Richard scoffs at the notion that the simple suggestion is sanctimonious .
Advertisement
“ The intent is not to be preachy -- just offer a tip on how to save paper , ” he said .
Businesses have reasons beyond cost and tree saving to promote prudent printing , said Randolph Kahn , founder of Kahn Consulting , which specializes in helping businesses design and implement information management strategies .
Having a no- print policy along with scheduled purges of e-mails can help a business stave off spending millions of dollars to produce documents connected to lawsuits , Kahn said .
“ For most corporations that have a policy to not print out e-mail , do I really think it ’s about saving trees ?
I have some questions , ” Kahn said .
“ Maybe it ’s about trees and maybe it ’s about having a company better manage and control its information . ”

Fuel TV’s Munsey said he understood why the eco-signature was a good idea for companies and the environment .
But he sheepishly added that corporate encouragement to add the line was among the reasons he took his own eco-signer off .
“ Once everyone started using it and thinking about it , the idea was out there and it was time to move on , ” Munsey said .
“ That ’s how I ’m justifying taking it off .
But the reality is that I took it off because everyone else was doing it . ”

Under a Kucinich Administration , the U.S. will :
Lead the way toward the complete elimination of nuclear weapons from the earth .
Our goal should be a steady movement toward complete nuclear disarmament .
Renounce first - strike policy .
We must set aside the Bush Administration 's Nuclear Posture Review , which is a strategy for nuclear proliferation .
We must assure the world community that the United States will not be the first to use nuclear weapons .
Cancel all U.S. nuclear weapons programs .
We must work to put an end to the development of any new nuclear weapons , to the manufacture of any nuclear weapons , and to any plans to test nuclear weapons .
Stop the use of all depleted uranium munitions .
We must order an end to the United States ' use of depleted uranium munitions .
We must lead an international effort to recover depleted uranium .
We must promote environmental remediation .
We must develop a program to provide care and restitution for people suffering as a result of the United States ' use of depleted uranium munitions , nuclear weapons , nuclear weapons production , nuclear testing , and uranium mining .
Ban all nuclear weapons testing by the United States .
We must enact a new policy banning nuclear testing and work to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty .
Open talks with all nuclear powers .
The U.S. must begin new talks with Russia , China , Britain , France , India , Israel , and Pakistan to develop a plan aimed at the complete elimination of nuclear weapons .
The first step should be to suspend all " readiness " levels of nuclear weapons systems , including those of the United States .
Encourage participation in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
We must encourage all nations to actively participate in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and meet personally with the leaders of India , Israel , and Pakistan to request that they sign as non-nuclear weapons states .
The President must also meet personally with Kim Jong
Il to encourage North Korea to rejoin the community of nations through reaffirming its participation as a non-nuclear weapons state .
Discourage nations from acquiring nuclear weapons .
We must work with the nations of North Korea , Iran , Algeria , Sudan , Syria , and others to discourage the acquisition of nuclear weapons capability .
Reinstate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and cancel the Ballistic Missile Defense .
We must work with Russian President Vladimir Putin to reinstate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty .
The treaty prevents both the United States and Russia from developing nationwide ABM defense systems and limits employment of new ABM technologies .
Consequently , the ballistic missile defense program must be cancelled .
Meet all requirements of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
We must work to ensure that the United States leads the world again in fulfilling all requirements of the treaty .
This means the United States must negotiate the complete elimination of its nuclear arsenal .
Commit to greatly expanding inspections .
We must work with the 188 signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency to greatly expand the use of inspections in all nations .
Lead an international effort to bring terrorists to justice .
The United States must participate in a cooperative world effort to track down terrorists who are seeking to acquire nuclear weapons capability .
The U.S. needs a new foreign policy of " Strength Through Peace " to reverse the disastrous neo-conservative doctrine of " peace through strength " , as well as a President who is not afraid to pursue diplomatic negotiations with all countries .
Dennis Kucinich will be this President ; aggressively pursuing multilateral and diplomatic solutions and establishing practical relationships , based upon open dialogue and fair negotiations , with countries that are currently being isolated and thus more hostile .
We need to meet with Iran , as well as Syria and all of the surrounding countries .
We must support a diplomatic approach in dealing with Iran .
According to the IAEA we have at least five years before a nuclear Iran , giving us adequate time to reach a solution ; though , only if we open dialogue and abandon the isolationist policies currently in action .
We need a new foreign policy towards Korea and a President who will visit both Koreas , meet personally with Kim Jong Il , and strive to block the self - fulfilling prophecy of the Bush administration 's " axis of evil . "
The U.S. should develop diplomatic and humanitarian relations with North Korea , with the goals of assisting the Korean people , furthering reunification , and advancing disarmament .
We should engage in direct negotiations with North Korea , and in a multilateral peace conference involving both Koreas and the surrounding states , to pursue a permanent peace settlement .
As a part of this process , we should consult closely with our South Korean allies , to evaluate appropriate conditions for a reduction or eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces .
By engaging in direct negotiations with North Korea and in a multilateral peace conference involving both Koreas and the surrounding states , the U.S. could pursue a permanent peace settlement .
This settlement would include a non-aggression agreement and a nuclear weapons - free zone .
Dennis Kucinich will take this country in a new direction .
We only need support him !
MILWAUKEE --
For a show that was about nothing , the hubbub
around it has certainly turned into something .
A Green Bay television station decided to have some fun this
week after employees discovered that Giants quarterback Eli
Manning 's favorite show is " Seinfeld . "
Station officials decided
to pull the episode scheduled for Saturday afternoon and replace it
with a different program chosen by viewers .
Manning and his New York teammates will be in town to play the
Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game Sunday afternoon .
News of WLUK - TV's decision apparently reached Jerry Seinfeld
himself .
" I 'm going to send Eli a complete collection of ' Seinfeld ' DVDs
and a partial collection of ' Hogan 's Heroes ' for inspiration , " the
comedian told the New York Post on Thursday .
" You think I 'm going to take that sitting down ? "
Jay Zollar , the Fox station 's general manager , laughed when he
heard of Seinfeld 's response .
Zollar joked that the offer actually
plays into the station 's master plan of preventing Manning from
being master of the domain on Sunday .
Mike McConnell fears risking US security if too much is revealed
Intelligence chief Mike McConnell said he would give no breakdown of how the money was spent , saying that disclosure could harm national security .
The disclosure was made to comply with a law passed by Congress last year .
The 2007 sum , split among 16 agencies , is almost double what was spent in 1997 and 1998 , the last budgets made public .
According to legislation signed into law by US President George W Bush , total intelligence spending must be revealed 30 days after the end of the fiscal year , on 30 September .
Exactly where the money goes remains classified , but a share will go on salaries for an estimated 100,000 people , among them intelligence analysts and spies , the Associated Press reports .
Also covered will be such expenses as high - tech secret satellite programmes , aircraft , weapons , computers and software .
Secret satellites
The budget includes money for the CIA , the Defence Intelligence Agency , the National Security Agency and FBI intelligence programmes , as well as agencies within the state and treasury departments .
The figure does not include what is spent by the US military on gathering intelligence .
Mr McConnell , releasing a brief statement highlighting the main figure , made it clear he did not intend to give more details .
" Any and all information concerning the intelligence budget , whether the information concerns particular intelligence agencies or particular intelligence programmes , will not be disclosed , " he said .
Intelligence officials have argued that detailed figures could be used by others to track fluctuations in spending and so ascertain information about secret intelligence schemes .
Former CIA director George Tenet released the budget figures for 1997 ( $ 26.6bn ) and 1998 ( $ 26.7bn ) , saying he saw no risk to national security in doing so .
Intelligence spending increased significantly after the 11 September , 2001 , terror attacks on the US .
The 2007 figure is greater than the national economies of all but the world 's 60 or so richest nations .
Tantek elik recently wrote a great entry on cognitive load in user interface , comparing instant messaging and email :
To instant message ( IM ) someone , you merely : switch to your IM client double click their name type your message press return
To email someone , you have to : switch to your email client choose " New / Compose Message " from the interface type the recipient 's name ( autocomplete in most email programs typically helps to reduce this to 3 - 4 keystrokes ) type tab or return to go to the next field ( typically another to or cc field ) type tab or return again to go to the subject field think up a subject ( or ideally skip it ) type a subject ( or ideally skip it ) type tab or return again to go to the message body field type in your message click send Ideally , assuming no subject ( which is atypical ) , and only typing 3 letters to autocomplete the recipients name , that 's ten steps -- more than 3 x the interface overhead of IM .
Jan Miksovsky covers similar ground when enumerating the hurdles at the entrance to a website :
Figure out what the service does , and whether it meets your needs .
Find the entry point for signing up .
Pick a user ID .
If the user ID is n't an email address , enter their email address .
Pick a password .
Enter the password again to confirm it .
Pick the password several more times to comply with arbitrary security requirements .
Write down the password somewhere before you forget the new variation of your usual password that finally made it past the arbitrary security requirements .
Enter personal data used to configure the service to your needs .
Comply with ( or carefully turn down ) requests for demographic data for marketing purposes .
This may include opting out of requests to be added to email newsletters .
Agree to terms of use and other legal agreements .
Activate their account .
The user might need to switch to a completely different application -- their email client -- and look for a message from the service .
Download software .
If the service entails client software or browser plug-ins , the user has an additional dozen hurdles to jump through : the browser 's save dialog , progress dialog , " Are you sure you want to run this ? " dialog , an elevate - to - administrator security dialog , and probably a firewall dialog -- not to mention the software 's own overly long sequence of setup questions .
John Gruber offers another example comparing calendar entry overhead :
My typical usage [ in iCal ] : Double - click on the date of the event in month view .
Type the event name .
Tab past Location .
Tab past " all - day " checkbox .
Tab past Month .
Tab past Day .
Tab past Year .
Enter the hour .
Enter the minutes .
Swap the AM / PM .
Compare and contrast to the event entry UI for the calendar feature in Backpack : Double - click on the date of the event in month view .
Type the time and name of the event .
Whether you call it cognitive load , a sequence of hurdles , interface overhead , or just plain excise , it all adds up to the same thing : interface friction for the user .
Sand in the gears of their mind .
One more unnecessary thing they have to think about before using your application .
How many steps does it take to do something in your application ?
Have you counted ?
Have you thought about ways to reduce or eliminate those steps for your users ?
If not , you absolutely should be .
Fire up your application and start counting as you click and type through the most common user scenarios .
I think you 'll be unpleasantly surprised .
Some interface friction is inevitable .
But it is possible to reduce interface friction to an absolute minimum .
One of the best " frictionless " sign - up user interfaces I 've ever seen is at reddit .
If you click any element that requires login , you 're presented with an overlay < div > that allows you to sign up in a single step and also complete the action you originally clicked on , in one fell swoop :
Reduced interface friction goes a long way toward explaining the popularity of services like twitter and tumbr .
What 's the minimum amount of effort a user can expend to produce something ?
The answer could be a key competitive advantage .
That single input box on the Google homepage starts to look more and more like an optimal user experience .
It might be unrealistic to reduce your application 's UI to a single text box -- but you should continually strive to reduce the friction of your user interface .
As a CIA officer in Turkey in the 1980s , I once had the misfortune of witnessing a man being tortured by the police .
In those days , Istanbul was home to a foreigners ’ prison , which has now been converted into a luxury hotel .
In the foreigners ’ prison anyone who was not a Turkish citizen was automatically dumped for processing and eventual imprisonment or deportation .
The processing could take months , conditions were appalling , and the prisoners were frequently beaten by guards to extort confessions or just to pass the time .
I was in the prison looking for an American citizen who had reportedly been arrested in Istanbul while on a business trip .
It was my job as an officer in the U.S. embassy to try to get him properly charged with a crime or released .
I was inside the prison when a man was dragged in by two policemen .
He had been picked up on the streets and was believed to be a dealer in soft drugs including marijuana and hashish .
As anyone who has seen the movie Midnight Express will recall , Turkey is brutally tough on drug offenders .
I stood and watched , unable to intervene in any way as the beating began , something that the prison warden assured me was routine in drug cases .
The man , identified by the warden as an Iranian , was chained to a wall .
The chains were pulled up tight so that he could not quite touch the floor with his feet .
Two guards went at the suspended man with rubber truncheons , first beating his feet and then working their way up his body , ending up by crushing his fingers and smashing one of his collar bones .
The man screamed the whole time and begged for mercy , apparently agreeing in his own language to confess to whatever his tormentors wanted , but the guards took no notice .
After what seemed an interminable time but was probably not more than 20 minutes , the man , who was semiconscious and sobbing uncontrollably , was doused with a bucket of water , released from his shackles , and hauled away to sign his confession .
I later learned that the American citizen I had been seeking had been arrested at the airport for having in his possession counterfeit travelers ’ checks .
He had also been beaten up by his jailers , though out of deference to his nationality he had not been subjected to the same level of abuse as the Iranian man I had seen tortured .
The Iranian prisoner was probably a genuine drug dealer , and one might argue that the torture was a useful tool that made him confess to something that he had actually done .
Torture does sometimes produce a desired result , which is why it has been used extensively for thousands of years .
But when beating a suspect to extract information , one cannot discriminate between truth and lies .
One cannot determine whether the man was actually innocent and had only made up a plausible story to stop the pain .
Many intelligence and security services around the world still use torture to obtain information and confessions .
As every intelligence officer who has had access to information believed to be produced in that fashion knows , torture impels the victim of the punishment to confess to anything and everything in an attempt to make the pain stop .
The information that comes from physical abuse is unreliable and frequently false .
In the latest controversy over the use of “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” by the United States , President George W. Bush has rejected claims his administration uses torture and has defended the methods allegedly being used by the CIA .
Bush was responding to the Oct. 3 New York Times report that the U.S. Justice Department secretly authorized harsh interrogation techniques for terror suspects in 2005 only months after a 2004 public statement in which the selfsame Justice Department declared that torture would not be acceptable in interrogations of terrorist suspects .
On Oct. 5 Bush said , “ This government does not torture people .
We stick to U.S. law and our international obligations . ”
Bush ’s comments are contradicted by the New York Times report , which states that the interrogation techniques approved in the 2005 Justice Department memo were some of the most brutal ever used by the CIA .
They included head - slapping , exposure to freezing temperatures , and simulated drowning , which has been referred to as water - boarding .
The 2005 legal opinion came shortly after Alberto Gonzales took over the Justice Department , and it was followed up by a second memo issued later that year that advised that none of the techniques employed by the CIA would breach anti-torture legislation before Congress that barred “ cruel , inhuman , and degrading ” treatment of prisoners .
Bush ’s defense of his administration ’s interrogation methods included the explanation that the questioning is carried out by “ highly - trained professionals . "
He elaborated , “ When we find somebody who may have information regarding an attack on America , and you bet we ’re going to detain them , you bet we ’re going to question them .
The American people expect us to find out information , this actionable intelligence , so we can help protect them .
That ’s our job . ”
The president added that the techniques used had been “ fully disclosed to appropriate members of the United States Congress , ” but Democrats in both the Senate and House of Representatives denied that they had been briefed and demanded to see the two reported secret memos from 2005 .
The Bush administration frequently points to the success of its employment of extreme interrogation techniques .
The White House claims that it has saved lives and thwarted terrorist plots , though the assertions are never supported by any compelling evidence .
Some other sources in the government suggest the opposite , that torture of terrorist suspects in U.S. custody has never produced any significant information , much less intelligence that has saved American lives .
In the one reported instance in which government sources concede that extreme interrogation tactics were used , that of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , it is illuminating to examine what exactly was obtained .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , commonly referred to as KSM , was arrested in 2003 in Pakistan .
He was reportedly water - boarded and “ broken ” by his CIA interrogators .
He subsequently confessed to being involved in virtually every terrorist act carried out in the past 20 years , including 9/11 , the beheading of journalist Daniel Pearl , and the bombing of the destroyer USS Cole .
He clearly was not actually involved in many of the incidents , but he was willing to admit to anything .
The issue of torture as a reliable interrogation tool aside , torture brutalizes and degrades the individual carrying it out , the organization he or she represents , and the government that approves of the practice .
Even people who support many of the excesses resulting from the so - called War on Terror frequently understand that there are lines that should not be crossed , and torture is one of them .
There have been reports that the CIA has had difficulty in recruiting people willing to carry out “ extreme interrogation . ”
That attorney general - designate Michael Mukasey , who is almost certain to be confirmed by Congress , claims not to know whether water - boarding amounts to torture or not is outrageous .
That the president of the United States has not been challenged by the public and press when he explains that “ we do not torture ”  while he refuses to make public secret memos contradicting his words  marks a sad day for those who revere our liberties .
Mukasey and Bush ’s evasions are symptomatic of the loss of any moral compass in post - 9/11 American politics .
新バージョンで何が変わるのか、Rubyはどこへ向かうのか
まつもと×笹田 、Ruby 1.9を語る
「 そういえばあのretryの話、どう思う？ 」 、「誰も使ってないから害悪が多いっていう話は説得力ありますよね」、「じゃあなくすか……、うん、なくしといて」、「あ、決まっちゃった（笑）」――。
まつもとゆきひろと、笹田耕一。いま、世界が注目するプログラミング言語「Ruby」の生みの親と、開発コアメンバーの2人は、こともなげにRubyの仕様を記者の目の前で変更してしまった。Rubyの開発はどのように行われ、どこへ向かおうとしているのか。現行のバージョン1.8系から大きく様変わりする次期開発版「
Ruby 1.9」のリリースを12月25日に控えた2人に、師走の秋葉原で話を聞いた（文中、敬称略）。
Rubyの仕様は密室で決まる!?
冒頭に紹介した2人の会話は、「retry」というRubyの文法の2種類ある使い方のうち、これまでほとんど使われた形跡がない方を文法仕様から取り除くかどうか、という話だ。すでに事前に判断材料がそろっていたとはいえ、事実上2人だけの話し合いで決まってしまった。
――こんな風に言語に新しい仕様を加えたり、取り除いたりというのは日常茶飯事なのですか？
まつもと 最近あまり仕様を勝手に変更すると「ぎゃっ」という人が増えたので、だいぶ減りましたけどね。
――仕様変更の議論はメーリングリストではなく、オフラインの密室状態で行われることも？
まつもと 物事は密室で決まることになってるんです（笑） メーリングリストでの議論を踏まえて、だいたい1人とか2人で決めちゃいますね。
笹田 全部オープンな場で関係者全員で議論していたら収拾が付かなくなるってこともありますよね。まつもとさんを説得してエイヤッで決めてしまうことも多いです。
まつもと 特に外国人の方々は議論が見えないことが多くて不満もあるかもしれませんけどね。
笹田 例え ばRuby 1.9では文字列処理の方法が大きく変わるんですが、そのとき文字コードについてさんざん議論しましたけど、それは日本人開発者の間だけでしたよね。
まつもと いやいや、日本語のほうが多かったけど、英語で議論している人はいたよ。
――Java VM 上 のRuby実装である「 JRuby」の開発者の1人、チャールズ・ナッターが、日本語の情報が読めないためにRuby開発コミュニティで何が起こっているのか分からないと不平を述べていましたね。
笹田 うーん、かつて 、Rubyの開発者メーリングリストのサマリーを定期的に有志が英訳していたんですけど、あまり反響がなかったんですよね。2005年か2006年頃まで続けていました。
――むしろ早すぎたのではないですか？
笹田 そうかもしれません。中断した理由はマンパワーが足りなかったということなので、もし、「
詳しい技術のことは分からないけどRubyに貢献したい」という人がいたら、ぜひボランティアで英訳をやってもらえるとうれしいですね。
40人のコミッターのうち30人弱が日本人
インタビュー中にも笹田は、思い出しように次々に細かな変更リクエストをまつもとに対して出した。例えば、GC（ガーベージコレクタ）の並列化のアイデアについて話しているとき、笹田はおもむろに「gc.cのグローバル変数をやめて構造体で1つにまとめるとかしませんか」と切り出し、まつもとは鷹揚に「それは反対しません」と対応する場面があった。「ではやっておきます」という笹田のひと言で話が片付くというスピード感だ。
まつもとは島根県をベースに東京と島根を往復する生活だが、その際の拠点の1つは東京・秋葉原にほど近い末広町にある。一方の笹田は現在、秋葉原駅前のビルが勤務先だ。
まつもとゆきひろ。1965年生まれ。世界的に人気が高まるプログラミング言語「Ruby」（ルビー）の生みの親。株式会社ネットワーク応用通信研究所勤務で、楽天技術研究所のフェロー、Rubyアソシエーション理事長も務める。現在、妻と4人の子どもと島根県在住。東京と島根を往復する日々。筑波大学第三学群情報学類卒業。
笹田 Rubyの開発をやっていて良かったと思うのは、やっぱり開発者のまつもとさんが日本人だったことですよね。Perlの作者であるラリー・ウォールに対して「 Perlのここは良くない」とは言いづらいですし、英語では議論しづらいし（笑）
まつもと ぼくには言いやすいかもしれないよね（笑 ）
笹田 こうして気軽に会うことができますしね 。
――おふたりは普段はネットでもよく会話されてるんですか？
まつもと うーん、会ったときは延々と話してますけどね。
笹田 Rubyの日本人コア開発メンバー はIRCに常駐してる方がいるので、私はIRCを使いますね。バグの報告があったときにIRCで議論して解決することが多いんです。そこで開発が回ってる部分はあります。
まつもと ぼく はIRC はしないんですよ。時間がなくなっちゃうから（笑）
笹田 まつもとさんはエッジの部分を開拓していくことに専念してますね。
――まつもとさんはバグ修正など細かなことを自分でやりたくないのでは？
まつもと いや、やりたいんだけど、ぼくがやるといつまでも終わらないんで、「まつもとに任せてちゃいけない」って感じで、後ろでサポートして直してくれる人たちがいるんです。
笹田耕一。1979年生まれ。東京大学大学院 情報理工学系研究科創造情報学専攻 特任助教。2004年、Ruby処理系の仮想マシン「
YARV」の実装を始める。情報処理推進機構が主催する未踏ソフトウェア創造事業で2004年度（未踏ユース）、2005年度、2006年度と3年連続でYARVプロジェクトは採択され、Ruby 1.9で正式にRubyに取り込まれた。
笹田 まつもとさんのコミットがあったときに、 「 あ、またまつもとさんがバグ入れてるよ」ということが、よくあります（笑）
まつもと ぼくがゴリゴリ穴を掘るんだけど、後ろで
「あ、危ない、危ない」って支えてくれる人がいるんですよ。見守られています。ありがたいことです（笑）
――現在 、Rubyのコミッター（ソースコードの変更権を持つ開発者）は何人ぐらいいるのですか？
まつも と 40人ぐらいですね。そのうち30人弱が日本人。アメリカを除くとドイツに数人いたかな。ただ、40人いるといっても2、3回コミット（オリジナルのソースコードの変更）をして、それきり見かけないという人もいます。
笹田 ライブラリをコミットするためにコミッターになって、そのライブラリが安定したらもうコミットしないという人とかね。
まつもと そういう意味で はRuby 全体を見ているコミッターは5〜6人でしょうか。
― ―Linuxカーネルの開発者だと企業や研究所に属する人も多いですが、Rubyはいかがですか？
まつもと Rubyの場合、私のところ（NaCl）を除くと、少なくとも企業を看板にしている人はいませんね。
― ―40人のコミッターは平等な立場ではないのですよね。まつもとさんが頂点に？
笹田 明らかなバグの修正であれば、みんな勝手にコミットしますけど、仕様に関わるようなところは、まつもとさんにお伺いを立ててからということになっています。だから私が入院してもどうにでもなると思いますけど、まつもとさんが入院したらRubyの開発は止まるでしょうね……、いや、仕様を変える人がいなくなるのでRubyの仕様が安定するメリットがあるかもしれませんが（笑）
Ruby 1.9 は “ ブリーディング・エッジ” の開発版
――Ruby 1.9について教えてください。1.9系の初めての正式版が12月25日に出る、ということでよろしかったですよね（編集部注：12月25日の深夜、Ruby 1.9.0正式版がリリースされた）。
まつもと 何かは出ます 。
――実際は動いているコードがあるので、いまでも出せるといえば出せますよね。
まつもと いまのままでも（笑 ）
笹田 いや、ちょっといまのままでは出せませんね。いろいろとバグ報告をいただいているのが収まっていないので……。
まつもと まあ、バグはしょうがないよ 。
笹田 どこまで互換性を考えるかですけどね 。Rubyから見たら内部インターフェイスは変わらないかもしれないけど、まだC言語レベルで変わる可能性が残っていて……。
まつもと その辺はいいんじゃないの？ 安定版 のRuby 1.8だとまずいけどさ。
笹田 互換性とか安定性の話で言うと 、 Ruby 1.8の立ち位置ってRailsが出てきてだいぶ変わりましたよね。以前は良くも悪くも、まつもとさん個人のプロジェクトという側面が大きかったじゃないですか。それがいまや「安定しなければならない」という周囲からのプレッシャーのようなものがありますよね。
まつもと うん、だからそういうのを全部押し付けるために1.8系を残しているわけで、1.9では好きにさせてと（笑）
――安定させなくても大丈夫なんですか？
まつもと もちろん気は使っていますよ。でも、1.8に関してバイナリ互換性がなくなったらまずいと思うんだけど、1.9はいいんじゃないかな、という判断です。少なくとも1.8と1.9の開発が並行して動いている間は。
笹田 1.8は安定してきていますよね。いまはリリースマネージャも2人いるし。
――安定性を求めるなら1.9の新しい仕様は使わず、安定版の1.8を使ってくださいということですね。
まつもと Railsも1.9対応になっていないですしね。
笹田 だけど、たぶん世の中の人 は1.9にも1.8との互換性や安定性を求めていますよ。例えばJavaのVMでサン・マイクロシステムズが「次バージョンでバイナリ互換性はなくなります」なんてことを言ったら大ブーイングですよ。
――これは原稿にするとまずいのですよね……。
まつもと いえいえ、逆にこれをちゃんと伝えていただきたいんです。1.9は安定版じゃなくて開発版です。“ブリーディング・エッジ”
（Bleeding Edge）といって血がどばどば出ている状態のものです。そのために1.8系を用意しているということです。1.9の荒削りな部分が丸くなるには年単位で時間がかかると思うんです。そのときまでは1.8が運用されていると思います。もし何かの事情で1.9をエンタープライズで使いたいということであれば、自己責任でやっていただくしかない。
――でも、あまりエッジなことをやっていると、1.8系と互換性のあるJRubyがマスマーケットを獲って、Ruby 1.9とかい離していく可能性もあるんじゃないですか。
まつもと ええ 、Ruby 2.0が1.x系をサポートするJRubyと別物になる可能性はありますよね。
Rubyアソシエーション設立でRubyのサポート体制を強化
笹田 例えばJBossのバックにはレッドハットがいて、サポートがあります。Rubyにそれがあるかというと、ありません。まつもとさんの所属するNaCl（ネットワーク応用通信研究所）は、Ruby関連のサポートを提供しているとはいえ、基本的にはまつもとさんを雇っていること以外のコミットメントは、あまりしていませんよね。そういう意味で、ほかのエンタープライズアプリケーションとは違います。
エンタープライズ向けの開発・サポートを期待する方々がいるのは分かっていますけど、RubyをJBossのようなものと同じ土俵で考えると違います。Rubyでも、そういう体制ができればいいのかもしれませんけどね。
まつもと そういう受け皿とし てRubyアソシエーションを考えてはいますけど、いまのところ1人雇ったら予算が全部吹っ飛んじゃうので、まだ難しいですね。
笹田 あ、そういう計画があるんですか ？
まつもと そのために法人格を取ったんだしね。法人格が必要なことは、予算の範囲内で何でもやりますよ。Rubyに対する投資や寄付についても、準備が整ったら始めたいですね。すでに誰もが名前を知っていてグローバルに事業を展開している企業からもアプローチがあったりするんですよ。
笹田 その寄付は安定版の1.8に対してのものになるんですか、開発版の1.9に対してのものになるんですか？
まつもと 企業ユーザーにしてみれば、1.8がより安定することもうれしいでしょうし、1.9がより早くエンタープライズレベルに到達することもうれしいでしょうから、どっちに投資していただけるかは企業次第でしょうね。でも、1.8基金とか1.9基金と分けて寄付に紐を付けるのかどうかは、まだ決まってません。できれば使い道はRubyアソシエーションに一任して欲しいですけどね。
― ―Rubyアソシエーションでは検定試験も始めていますが、ほかに何か具体的な案は？
まつもと まだ理事長としての私のアイデアの段階ですけど 、Ruby関連の開発プロジェクトを公募して、少額の助成金を出す「マイクログラント」を考えています。Rubyそのものでも、Ruby on Railsでも、ともかくRubyに関連したことであれば対象にします。数十万円という額ですけど、それでもプロジェクトをやりたいという人がいるようであれば、お金を出したいですね。人数的に厳しいかもしれませんけど、選ばれたプロジェクトのメンバーには、導き手となるメンターも付けられればとも考えています。
笹田 私、メンターやりたいです 。
Ruby 1.9の最大の特徴は仮想マシンの採用
――Ruby 1.9と1.8の違いについて教えてください。
まつもと 最大の違いは笹田くんが書いたコードが入っていることです。1.8は、ぼくがこつこつ作ってきたものの延長で、非常に素朴な実装になっています。内部的には抽象構文木（AST：Abstract Syntax Tree）というものを構成して、そのツリー構造をたどりながら処理を実行しています。この処理を担当する「eval.c」という1万数千行のコードを全部取っ払って、1.9では笹田君が書いた「YARV」という仮想マシン（VM）のコードを入れました。
笹田 クルマにたとえれば、エンジンが入れ替わったようなイメージでしょうか。
まつもと そうだね、重量比的には大きな割合ではないけど、決定的な違いです。ランタイムやライブラリはそのままです。1.9でも、先ほど言ったASTは作るんですけど、それをバイトコード――実際にはワードコードですけど――という数字の列に変換して、それを実行する形になります。要するに1段階、ステップが増えています。
笹田 JavaのVMと同じで、あの構造に追い付いたということです。
まつもとが手元にあったペーパータオルに書いた概略図
――コンパイルというか変換のオーバーヘッドというのはないのですか？
笹田 もちろん、あります。ありますが、起動時に100分の何秒か遅くなるという程度です。
まつもと 普通のプログラムであれば、読み込んで1回だけコンパイルしてASTを作り、1回だけバイトコードに変換して実行するので影響は小さいんです。
笹田 プログラ ム が10 万行もあればコンパイルに時間がかかると思うんですが、Rubyでそこまで大規模なものは、あまりないですよね。
ただ、例えばRailsをCGIで使うとなると、ちょっと問題になるかなという気はしているんですけど……。その辺はプリコンパイルみたいな処理を考えています。
――プリコンパイルしたバイナリコードをはき出すということですか？
笹田 ええ、今 年の12月に出すバージョンには入れていませんが、そういうことを考えています。
まつもと すでに道具立てはそろっていますから、やればできるんですけどね。バイトコードを出したいという人は結構いるんですけど、どのぐらい意味のあることなのか、個人的にはちょっと分かりません。
笹田 少なくともわれわれの興味ではないです 。
VM化によるメリット
――なるほど。それで、VM採用によるメリットは？
笹田 これまでできなかった高速化や最適化ができることです。
まつもと AST のツリー構造をたどるのは、意外に重たい処理だったんです。ポインタを動かして次のオブジェクトを取り出す、という処理です。このポインタの操作は軽いと思っていたんですけど、結構重たくて……。
笹田 いまのプロセッサアーキテクチャだと、アドレスが離れてるとキャッシュに当たらないんですよね。それでポインタを動かすとキャッシュミスが起こって、メモリアクセスに余計にサイクルかかっちゃう。
まつもと VMではバイトコードを順に読み出して実行するので、次の命令を実行するのは配列を1つインクリメントするだけとシンプルなんですよ。
笹田 VM化によって、いままでできなかった最適化ができるようになります。ASTの場合、この木とこの木を入れ替える、ということが難しかったんですけど、バイトコードのようにシリアルに並んでいる配列をちょこちょこいじるというのは結構簡単にできるんです。
例外処理の方法も1.9では変更して速くなっています。1.9ではバイトコードにコンパイルする時に例外処理の飛び先アドレスを書いた表を用意しておくんですね。1.8では、そこをダイナミックにやっていたので余計な処理が発生していた。1.9では例外が発生した時点で初めて処理を行います。これは1.8に比べると少し重たい処理なんですけど、例外処理が発生するのは文字通り例外的なので、例外が起こったときにだけ処理しましょうという発想です。これはVM化によって可能になったことの一例です。これもJavaと同じようにしたということですけど。
バイトコードをいかに速く動かすかというのは、長らく研究されていて論文の蓄積もあります。そういうアイデアを実装して入れていくことで、だいぶ速くなりました。
――それ はJava VMの研究開発からも影響を受けているんですか？
笹田 ええ、た だ 、Java VM の場合は、ものすごい最適化をしているんですね。例えばx86のこのプロセッサでは、こんなことができる、というレベルで最適化をしています。ものすごく速いですよね。
まつもと YARV では、まだハードウェア依存の最適化は手を出してないんだよね。
笹田 ええ、 私1人だけで開発していたので、x86で最適化するとほかのアーキテクチャのマシンで動かないとか、ほかのマシンで遅いままになってしまいます。それが嫌だったので、まずはC言語のレベルでどこまで速くできるかをやってきました。それも、とりあえず一段落したので、次はx86用かなと思っていますけど。
まつもと えっ、そうなの!?
笹田 JavaだとJITコンパイラとか、Hotspotとか高速化技術がいろいろとありますよね。そういうレベルのことです。あるいは、「LLVM」（Low Level VM）というオープンソースのソフトウェアがあるんですけど、このLLVM向けに最適化するという手もあります。YARVのバイトコードをLLVM向けにコンパイルすると、ハードウェア依存の部分はLLVMのほうでうまく最適化してくれます。新たに一層加えて最適化を丸投げしちゃうというアイデアです。
――最適化という意味では、まだまだできる？
笹田 まだやってないことはたくさんあります 。
――人手やお金があればできるという感じですか？
まつもと いや、むしろ時間でしょうか。いま以上に人が集まらないんですよ。
笹田 私は人が集まればやってほしいなと思っているんですけどね。絶対全部できないじゃないですか。まつもとさんのように全部自分でやりたいというのも理解できますけど。
――まつもとさんは、あまり下の方には興味がなかったのではないですか？
低レベルな層でキャッシュラインの最適化を考えるスピード狂の人がいたり、いろいろな層の人がいて、ちょうどいいのでは？
1人じゃ無理ですよね。
まつもと 残念ながら、それは認めましょう（笑）。本当は全部自分でやりたいタイプなんですけど、最近は講演も忙しかったりして…… 。1999年にはコードネーム「
Rite」という名前でRubyもVM化するぞと宣言したんですけど、5年以上ほったらかしにしてあったんですね。そんな自分に対する罰としてVM化の部分は笹田くんに譲りました（笑）
うーん、でも、構文木をたどる方式としては、やれることはやってるんですどね。小手先でやれることは限界までやってます。
笹田 いや、もうちょっとやれると思いますよ 。
まつもと えーっ、そうなの？ ショボーン（笑 ）
――ところで、おふたりで仕様や最適化のアイデアについてお話しをされていると、プロ棋士が碁盤なしに頭の中だけで将棋を指している姿を思い出します。どことどこを変更すると、どういう影響が出てということを考えたり、2人で話したりするとき、PCや実際のソースコードは不要なものですか？
とすると、例えばシャワーを浴びているようなときにも、Rubyのことを考えている？
まつもと ええ、それがいちばん楽しい時間です。さっきも新幹線の中で仕様を考えていました。
笹田 私もYARV の実装を始めたときは寝ても覚めても実装方法、高速化手法を考えていました。電車での待ち時間など、暇つぶしの必要がなかったくらい。
まつもと 寝床に入ってしばらくしてから、 「 はっ、あのバグの原因はあそこにあった！」とひらめくことなんかもあります。それでPCの前に座ってコードを見ると、なんと、すでに直っていてビックリ！
って、それは単に自分が直したのを忘れてただけなんですけど（笑）
最近は、いろいろ手書きでメモを取るようにしていますね。
普通のプログラム はRuby 1.9で1.5倍程度に高速に
――Ruby 1.9では1.8に比べて、どのぐらい速くなるのでしょうか？
笹田 Cで書かれたライブラリが速くなるわけではないので、例えば正規表現を使ってがんがん検索するような処理だとYARVにしても、残念ながら速くなりません。
まつもと 速くなるの はRubyの普通の処理です。例えば変数の代入とかループを回したりという処理が速くなっているので、そこがボトルネックになっているようなものは速くなりますね。フィボナッチ数列の計算とか（笑）
笹田 パズルとか、文字列処理みたいなものが少ないプログラムは2倍くらい速くなるんじゃないかと思います。
――高速になれば適用範囲も広がるんでしょうか。
笹田 例えば科学技術計算に使えるかといえば、まだそこまで速くないですけど、そのプロトタイピングぐらいには使えるかもしれません。少なくともフィボナッチの結果を見て「 Ruby遅い」といっている人たちには、その理由はなくなりましたよと言えるぐらいにはなっています。
まつもと ああ、それは結構大きい 。 Great Language Shootoutっていうプログラミング言語のベンチマークのサイトがあるんですけど、その成績で言語を決めるという人って結構無視できない数いるんです。
ぼくらは 「 言語の一部の性能しか計測しないマイクロベンチマークなんて意味ないよ」と内心は思ってるんですよ。でも、そんなベンチマークは役に立たないよと言って回るよりは、そのベンチマークで好成績が出るように言語の性能を上げたほうが早い。実際、Shootout系のベンチマークは1.9で速くなるので、Shootoutをマーケティングに逆利用できそうです。
笹田 私の感覚では普通のプログラムで1.5倍ぐらい速くなるという印象ですね。Rubyは遅いなと感覚的に感じていた方なら、改善される可能性はあります。I/Oやネットワークがボトルネックだと違いますけどね。まだI/O関連の処理では高速化や最適化でできることがたくさんあるので、これからも速くしていこうと思っていますけど。
IPA 未踏ソフトウェア創造事業2006年後期の成果発表の場で笹田氏が示したRuby
1.9のベンチマーク結果。青いグラフは4コアのOpteron搭載マシンのLinux上で実行した場合、赤いグラフは2コアのPentium D搭載マシンのLinux上で実行した場合。横軸は現行Rubyに対して何倍速いかを示す。フィボナッチ数列の計算では8〜10倍高速化されている。基本機能の性能向上によって、実アプリケーションの実行速度も1.5〜2倍速くなるという
作った本人も知らなかったYARV採用の顛末
――笹田さんが書かれ たYARVがRuby 1.9に採用された経緯について、もう少し教えてください。Ruby処理系向けの高速なVMを作るというプロジェクトとして「
Yet Another Ruby VM 」 （YARV）という名前で作り始めたのはいつ頃ですか？
笹田 2004年の1月頃に学生で暇だったので趣味で始めました。それから4年経って、やっと実を結んだという感じですね。昔はアドオンみたいな感じだったんですけどね。
――ほかにもRuby向けのVMは、いろいろあったし、いまでもあるんですよね。
まつもと ええ、ほかに もCardinalと かRubiniusとか。
――まつもとさんは、いつ頃、自分のコードの代わりに、次期バージョンにYARVを採用しようと思ったんですか？
まつもと YARV が未踏に通ったときには、もう決めてました。
笹田 ええっ ！
まつもと 最初の未踏が終わった頃には、これはもう物になると思っていました。
笹田 ああ、そうだったんですか！ 知らなかった……。私が認識したのは2回目の未踏の成果発表会の日です。発表を盛り上げるために「YARVをRubyに入れていいですか」と聞いたんですね。そうしたら気楽に「うんいいよ」と答えていただいて。
まつもと ぼくの中では前から決めてたからね（笑） 初め てYARVのコードを入れ てRubyが動いたときは、ちょっと感動しましたよ。
1.9で大きく変わる文字列処理
――YARV採用のほか にRuby 1.9の大きな変更点は？
まつもと 多言語化です。まず前提として 、Rubyのポリシーに 「 内部コードを持たない」というのがあるんですね。内部に特定の文字コードを採用しない、ということです。
― ―Unicodeでは駄目なんですか？
まつもと 個々のアプリケーションはそれでいいのですが、プログラミング言語の場合、特定のエンコーディングを選択してしまうと、すべてがそれを選択せざるを得なくなってしまうんです。これは2つの理由で好ましくありません。
歴史上、日本には文字コードっていっぱいありますよね、シフトJIS、EUC、JIS、Unicodeと。そういう混在環境での処理方法は2つあります。1つは、どれかの文字コードに統一して後で変換して戻す方法です。しかし、これだと既存のドキュメントで変換が必須になって無駄ですし、2度の変換で文字化けが発生するという、いわゆるラウンドトリップが出来ないケースが出てきます。ファイルから読んで戻すだけなら同一の変換テーブルを使うのでいいのですが、どこかからデータを読んで書き出すとなると、何が起こるか分からない。と、考えると、諸悪の根源は変換です。だから、できるだけ変換をやりたくないと、1.8の時代から内部コードを持たないというポリシーでやってきたんです。
も う1つの理由はオープンエンドということです。例えば日本だと、研究者レベルではUnicodeではない文字コードを使っている人もいます。今昔文字鏡やGTコードなどです。そうしたものも平等に扱えるというオープンエンドというのも内部コードを持たないメリットなんです。
まあ、ただ、文字コードは外部の環境の影響も大きくて……。例えばGUIライブラリがUnicodeしか受け付けないとかだと、結局渡す前に変換する必要がありますよね。実はそういうケースが増えていて、ちょっと苦労が報われない感じなんですけど。
笹田 文字列といったら、ちゃんと文字単位で扱えないと嫌だという声が強かったんですよ。UTF-8だったら、lengthメソッドで返ってくる値はバイト数じゃなくて文字の長さであってほしいと。
まつもと そういうわけで
、1.9では文字単位で操作できるようになります。“ あいうえお” が5文字です。
――現状の1.8だとどうやって数えるんですか？
まつもと 正規表現を使って文字単位に切って数えます。文字単位で文字列を扱うということは、そもそも正規表現を使うだろうという考え方です。個人的には正規表現でほとんど用は足りると思うんですけど、要望が多かったんです。
笹田 Rubyの場合、lengthメソッドで文字列の長さが欲しい人もいるし、バイト長が欲しい人もいる。それがなかなか解決できなかったんですよね。
まつもと 例え ばJavaの場合、サロゲートペアを使ったUTF-16のエンコーディングで正しい文字数を返すAPIというのが、通常の文字列の長さを返すAPIとは別に用意されています。文字列の長さを返す似たようなAPIが2つあるというのは、シンプルさを重視するRubyとしてはやりたくない。
それで、1.9からは文字列1つずつにエンコーディング情報を持たせるようにしたんです。「この文字列はUTF-8で書いてある」というようにです。
― ―Javaに比べてRubyではシンプルさを優先したということでしょうか。
まつもと 私は自分 で
はJavaは書かないんですが、読んでるだけで頭が混乱することがあります。文字列の扱いでいうと、input streamの上にstringbufferを積み重ねて……って、覚えてられない（笑）
笹田 Ruby では文字列に文字列を追加することが簡単にできますけど、Javaでは可変長のstringbufferにいったん文字列を入れて、作業が終わったら、そこで確定して固定長のstringに代入するという処理が一般的ですよね。string型とstringbuffer型の2つがあって書き方を覚えなきゃいけない。
もちろん、性能を考えるとそのほうが有利な局面もありますけど、プログラマの書きやすさを考えると、stringという型は1つのほうがいいですよね。
Rubyのシンプルさを支える大クラス主義
――Ruby 1.9の新機能にFiber（ファイバ）が入ると聞きました。
笹田 Fiber自体はあまり気にしていただかなくて結構です。FiberはGeneratorを実装するために使っています。JavaのイテレータのようなものをRubyで書くのは大変だったんですよね。
まつもと Javaのイテレータでは、配列からオブジェクトを1つ取ってきて、そのオブジェクトにアクセスすると別の配列からオブジェクトを1つずつ取ってきて順に処理する、ということができるんですね。
Rubyではブロックと呼ぶんですが、配列オブジェクト自体がメソッドを持っていて、メソッドの中で閉じているんですね。だからJavaのイテレータに似た処理をするには別のオブジェクトを作らないといけなくて面倒なんです。
Rubyのブロック は
「1つ取ってきて渡して処理して、また次に1つ取ってきて処理」というモデルで、シンプルで分かりやすいというメリットがあります。でも、2つ配列があって1つずつ取り出してきて処理するというのは、面倒だったんです。
笹田 言語によっては外部イテレータとか、カーソルオブジェクトといいますよね。そういうポインタみたいなものが以前はGeneratorというライブラリで提供されていました。それをもっと手軽に、軽量に行う仕組みが1.9でEnumeratorに導入されました。
まつもと 1.8に もEnumerator とGeneratorという2つの似たようなライブラリがあったんですけど、それが1.9ではEnumeratorに統一され、組み込みになりました。ここら辺、ああ、Rubyはやっぱり“
大クラス主義” だなって思いますね。
――大クラス主義とは？
笹田 似たような機能のものを大きなクラスにまとめるという方針です。たくさんあると覚えるのも大変だし、使い分けられないから、まとめちゃう。
例えば 「配列」といったとき、普通の言語ではpushで要素を加えたり、popで要素を取り出して配列の長さを縮めたりできませんよね。CやJavaの配列は固定長なので、できません。リスト構造を使うか、なければ自分で作ります。だけど、Rubyでは「似てるから1つにしちゃえ」という発想で配列がリスト構造のように振る舞い、伸び縮みします。
まつもと Rubyでは、スタックとか、キューとか、そういうデータ構造も含めて配列の「 Array」というクラスに全部突っ込んじゃってるんですよね。
笹田 だからデータ構造の授業 をRubyでやると大変なんです。スタックはこういう風に作るんですよといって、ポインタが次の配列を指してって説明しますよね。でも、Rubyではそういうのは一切要らなくて、全部配列で済みます（笑）
今後は並列処理もテーマに
――今後 、Rubyとは別にまったく新しくプロジェクトを始めるというお考えはないのですか？
まつもと うーん、ぼくは物事を始めるのにモーメントが大きいタイプなんですよ。Rubyでもまだまだできることがあるしなぁ。
――笹田さんは ？
笹田 Rubyの代替となるような言語は作ってみたいですね 。Rubyにも良い仕様、悪い仕様ってありますよね。
まつもと うん、あるね 。
笹田 研究者なので、例えばいまだったら並列向けの仕様を最初から入れると、どうなるんだろうという技術的な興味があります。
まつもと もともと笹田君は並列が専門の人だしね 。
――笹田さんは以前、こんな話をされていましたよね。プログラミング言語の新しいパラダイムをピュアに取り込むと、現実のプログラマには受け入れられなくて、Rubyのように新規性と伝統的な言語のスタイルや発想をバランスよく取り入れたものが普及する。同じように、並列化というテーマでも、あまりピュアに最初から並列化を目指すのではなく、うまいバランスがあるのではないか、と。
笹田 ええ、だか ら Ruby は Rubyでバランスよく並列処理は取り込んでいけばいいと思います。ただ、言語レベルで変えたらどうなるかなっていうことにも興味があります。これは思考実験で終わるような気もしますけど。
まつもと 既存言語の並列版といえば、こんな例もあるよ
。Satherって言語があるんですけどね、そのSatherの並列版としてpSatherというのがあるんです。パラレルSather。
笹田 そのpSatherって、うまく行ったんですか？
まつもと いや 、Sather自体がマイナーです（笑）
笹田 いや普及という意味ではなくて（笑 ）
まつもと pSatherではparloopというforの並列版に相当する構文が増えています。forのようにループを回すのではなく、並列でドカンと走らせることができる。ほかにもpSatherにはアクターモデルを実現する文法が追加されていたりします。
笹田 そのへん、どんな実装がいいんでしょうね。
まつもと 分からない。でも、少なくとも、いま のRubyのインスタンス変数の持ち方だと、厳しい気がする。
笹田 いや実は、そこはあまり問題ではないんですよ。
まつもと あっ、そうなの ？
笹田 ただ、やるんだったら、文字列を全部変更不可にするぐらいの変更が必要ですね。でも、それをやっちゃうとプログラマには不自然だし、使いづらいでしょうから、むしろRubyのような普通のプログラム言語が中に閉じているものが並列に動くのがいいのかなという気がします。いまのRubyは大域的に何でも出来ちゃうので、それを狭めて並列化する、というイメージです。
――それはまつもとさんが楽天でやってらっしゃるFairyプロジェクトみたいなものでしょうか。
まつもと あれは言語に手を入れるというよりも、システムを提供するタイプの並列ですね。並列というより分散システムです。グーグルのMapReduceとかGFSを意識しています。タスクを多数のマシンに振り分けるDSL（Domain Specific Language）を用意する形になるかもしれません。
――Rubyの並列版を作って「 pRuby」を名乗れば晴れてP言語の仲間入りですよ。Perl、Python、PHP、pRuby（笑）
笹田 なるほど ！
笹田氏の最新の研究成果について、グラフを見ながら議論する2人
今回 、Ruby 1.9について教えてくださいと2人に取材を依頼し、秋葉原のカフェで1時間ほどお話しいただいた。ちょうどお昼どきだったので、取材を終えてから記者も食事をご一緒させていただくことになった。
お昼の12時半ごろに入店して、店を出たのは実に夕方の4時過ぎ。あまりに長時間話し込んでしまい、まつもと氏は飛行機に乗り遅れてしまった。所々で2人の会話に割って入る私の質問に丁寧に答えていただきながらとはいえ、4時間にも渡って、まつもと氏と笹田氏は延々と技術論を続けた。Rubyについてばかりでなく、並列Rubyの可能性や、米アマゾンが取り組んでいる分散コンピューティングの論文の話、100年後のプログラミング環境の話、普段使っているPCやソフトウェアの話と話は弾んだ。
プログラミング言語としての可能性を追い求め、知的探求心から開発に情熱を燃やす2人を見ていると、これこそ1990年代以降にフリーソフトウェアが大きな力を持つに至った原動力なのではないかという思いが強くなった。いまのままRubyに関わって食べて行ければそれでいいと笑う欲のないまつもと氏にしろ、実装してみたいアイデアやプランに溢れた笹田氏にしろ、現在急速に進んでいるRubyの受容に対して意外に恬淡としている印象を受ける。Rubyが普及し、結果として世の中に役立つことは喜ばしいにしても、もともとの動機は、むしろ知的好奇心。記者には、「それがぼくには楽しかったから」といったLinux開発者のリーナス・トーバルス氏の姿に、まつもと氏らが重なって見える。
いつまでも楽しそうに議論している2人を見て記者は、こう思った。「これは、パズル好きの人が好きなだけパズルをやり続けている状況だ」。このパズルのたとえが妥当なら、Ruby 1.8 とRuby 1.9の位置付けを整理すると、こうなる。パズルを構成するピース自体は固定されていて、もう後は少しずつ入れ替えたり、ピースを洗練させるだけの状況――、それがRuby 1.8系だ。Ruby 1.9系というのはパズルを構成するピースすら作り替えるようなもの。
12月25日に正式リリースするRuby 1.9というのは当面、これからRubyを使ってみようというユーザーのためのものというよりは、知的好奇心から使ってみよう、中を覗いてみようという人たちのためのものだ。それは、自分たち同様のパズル好きのために、まつもと氏を中心とした開発メンバーらが用意したクリスマスプレゼントと言えるのかもしれない。

According to multiple other online sources appearing in the same Google search , the Iowa audience resoundingly supported Representative Kucinich ’ ( D - OH ) call for impeachment .
It looks as if the USA Today reporter on the scene may have relayed this truth to headquarters and it showed up online for a short time but then someone back at USA Today overrode this story and removed the truth the reporter had relayed back to the station .
What might be the reason for USA Today having a vested interest in suppressing the truth about how popular the impeachment of Cheney is among audience members at an Iowa presidential primary election campaign stop ?
Jean Charles de Menezes : Followed to train , then shot
Family 's reaction London 's Metropolitan Police force has been found guilty of endangering the public over the fatal shooting of a man officers mistook for a suicide bomber .
The force broke health and safety laws when officers pursued Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes to a Tube station and shot him seven times , a jury found .
It was fined £ 175,000 with £ 385,000 costs over the 22 July 2005 shooting .
The Old Bailey jury said police chief Cressida Dick , who led the operation , bore " no personal culpability " .
Ms Dick , now deputy assistant commissioner of the force , had been accused by prosecutors of failing to keep control of her officers .
Why did Jean Charles die ?
A step - by - step guide to killing Met 's 19 key failings Met Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said outside court that he was staying in his job - despite calls for his resignation .
Mr de Menezes 's relatives said they wanted to see a " full and thorough " inquest into the electrician 's death .
Harriet Wistrich , the family 's solicitor , said the police had been an " unstoppable force " when they pursued him , and the defence had " descended to the gutter " to blacken his name .
' Poorly briefed '
During the trial , the jury heard that Scotland Yard commanders had made a string of errors on 22 July that culminated in an unwarranted risk to the public and ultimately the death of Mr de Menezes .
HAVE YOUR SAY I hope that lessons have been learned .
But I also hope that it will not deter armed police making judgement calls to protect the majority

The operation began when detectives investigating the failed suicide bombings of the day before - 21 July - linked one of the suspects , Hussain Osman , to a block of flats in south London .
Mr de Menezes also lived in the block , and when he left home at 0930 BST , surveillance officers were unsure if he was their target .
Clare Montgomery QC , prosecuting , said the situation had worsened because senior officers failed to keep to their own agreed plan , while firearms teams were both poorly briefed and in the wrong locations .
This meant that it became impossible to effectively stop the suspected suicide bomber before he boarded a bus and headed for the Underground .
The Met denied this , saying its commanders and officers on the ground did all they could to apprehend the bombers and minimise the risks to the public .
' Isolated breach ' Anna Dunwoodie , who was in the same carriage as Mr Menezes when he was shot , told the BBC how she witnessed this " horrific " moment when armed police ran on board the train .
" It did n't feel to me like I was in the middle of a police operation , " she recalled .
" The men who came running in seemed quite chaotic .
I 'd describe them as slightly hysterical .
" Jean Charles , to my knowledge , did nothing out of the ordinary .
" I did n't notice him until he had a gun pressed to him .
It felt to me like he was someone who was being picked on at random because he was nearest to the door .
" We all ran to the sound of gunshots . "
After the verdict was delivered , Mr Justice Henriques said : " This was very much an isolated breach brought about by quite extraordinary circumstances .
" One person died and many others were placed in potential danger . "
Mr Menezes was caught on CCTV as he was followed by two officers
In deciding on a penalty , the judge said he was aware that a heavy fine would result in a loss to the public purse and a reduction in essential policing .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) said it hoped to publish its full report into the case within days , but " disciplinary issues " were still to be decided .
Chairman Nick Hardwick said the body appreciated the courage of some of the officers involved , but added : " However , the Met 's mission is to make London safer .
On this one occasion , they failed . "
This was a serial failure of organisation , training , tactics and resourcing
David Davis
Shadow Home Secretary
Sir Ian Blair 's statement Len Duvall , chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority , said the MPA fully supported Sir Ian and would continue to work with him .
" We ask the police to do a difficult job on our behalf and sometimes they make mistakes . "
The Liberal Democrats and Conservatives have called for the commissioner to resign .
But Home Secretary Jacqui Smith dismissed the calls , insisting Sir Ian had her " full confidence " and support .
BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said Sir Ian still has to face questioning from the MPA , a report into the shooting and an inquest into Mr de Menezes 's death .
" The question is can he survive this drip , drip , drip effect - or whether some people are going to say to him , rather than going through all that , it 's better that you go . "
Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said the guilty verdict made it more difficult for police to protect the capital against terrorism .
Brian Paddick , one of Sir Ian 's former senior officers , told BBC1's Question
Time the commissioner was wrong to say he would not resign without first taking some time for reflection .

What are these ?
So here comes another Clinton .
Does her being a woman make her a special case ?
Does gender confer meaning on her candidacy ?
In my opinion , it is a little late in the day to become sentimental about a woman running for president .
The political moment for feminine role models , arguably , has passed us by .
The children who are suffering in this country , who are having trouble in school , and for whom the murder and suicide rates and economic dropout rates are high , are boys  especially boys of color , for whom the whole educational system , starting in kindergarten , often feels a form of exile , a system designed by and for white girls .
In the progressive Midwestern city where I live , the high school dropout rate for these alienated and written - off boys is alarmingly high .
Some are even middle - class , but many are just hanging on , their families torn apart by harsh economics and a merciless criminal justice system .
Why does it seem to be the Republicans who are more vocal about reforming our drug laws ?
Why has no one in the Democratic Party campaigned to have felons who have served their time made full citizens again ?
Their continued disenfranchisement is a foolhardy strike against these men and their families .
Perfect historical timing has always been something of a magic trick  finite and swift .
The train moves out of the station .
The time to capture the imagination of middle - class white girls , the group Hillary Clinton represents , was long ago .
Such girls have now managed on their own ( given that in this economy only the rich are doing well ) .
They have their teachers and many other professionals to admire , as well as a fierce 67 - year - old babe as speaker of the House , several governors and a Supreme Court justice .
The landscape is not bare .
Boys are faring worse  and the time for symbols and leaders they can connect with beneficially should be now and should be theirs .
Hillary Clinton ’s gender does not rescue society from that  instead she serves as a kind of nostalgia for a time when it might have .
Only her policies are what matter now , and here  despite some squabbling and bad advice that has caused her to “ go negative ”  the Democrats largely agree .
But inspiration is essential for living , and Mr. Obama holds the greater fascination for our children .
Mr. Obama came of age as a black man in America .
He does not need ( as he has done ) to invoke his grandfather ’s life in colonial Kenya to prove or authenticate his understanding of race .
His sturdiness is equal to Mrs. Clinton ’s , his plans as precise and humane .
But unlike her , he is original and of the moment .
He embodies , at the deepest levels , the bringing together of separate worlds .
The sexes have always lived together , but the races have not .
His candidacy is minted profoundly in that expropriated word “ change . ”

檜山さんの Java を模した例からするとちょっとややこしいのですが、Smalltalk で、あるオブジェクトが属するクラスのクラスオブジェクトを得るのには # getClass ( ) ではなく、#class というメソッドをコールします。また、すでにクラスはすべて一階に落とし込み済みなので、クラス名はそのままクラスオブジェクトとして参照可能です（したがって .class の有無による両者の区別は無用）。スーパークラスへのアクセスは
# superclass を用います。
Smalltalk は 今は三階 四階 建てです。つまり、檜山さんの例のように CLASS （ あるいはそれを下階へ落とし込んだ
Class ）ひとつではなく、それぞれのクラスひとつにひとつづつにそれが属するクラスがあり、それをメタクラスと呼びます。メタクラスは原則として無名ですが、便宜的に「 クラス名 class 」と呼称します。ただこれは、メタクラスオブジェクトを得る式でもあるので、上のスクリプトでは紛らわしさを軽減するために式のほうは「 ( クラス名 ) class 」 、メタクラス自身を指すときは「 クラス名 class 」としてあります 。

Are you one of those people who want to play Magic the Gathering at every opportunity ?
Do you enjoy games that are n’t decided by mana screw ?
If either , then you will be interested by this article .
Read on .
Those of you who read Kelly Digges ’ article on the MindMaster Magic variant will be familiar with games you play as you open packs : games that are substitutes for real Magic , that one plays because one was about to open the packs anyway .
This game , which my father Jonathan Yedidia invented , will have you buying pairs of packs just so you can play it .
The Rules
First , you open each pack .
You lay them out on the table so everyone can see them , but the packs must remain distinct .
Players study the packs for a moment , then the bidding begins .
Players bid life .
They may bid at any time : it is whoever says the amount they are bidding first whose bid stands .
Bids can not be taken back .
The winner of the bid gets to choose whether he will :
• Choose whether or not to play first .
• Choose which pack he / she will draft from first .
That player will lose an amount of life equal to his bid , and the loser of the bid will make the choice the winner did n’t make .
The Drafting
This proceeds as a regular draft would , only with two players .
The player who chose which pack to draft from first takes his first pick from that pack ; the other player takes his first pick from the other pack .
Each player picks a card and places it face down in front of him / her .
Both cards are turned face up simultaneously .
Each player then passes the rest of the pack to the other player .
Players take their second picks the same way , all the way until each pack is exhausted .
Players then add a total of ten basic lands of any type to their deck , and it ’s time to play !
The Play
This is identical to normal Magic , with one fundamental difference : players may stack their decks AT ANY TIME !
This is the rule that differentiates this game from regular Magic : it takes away mana screw and makes “ curving out ” much more important .
There are a few special rules that surround it , however :
• If either player has seen the top or bottom cards of a player ’s deck , those cards may not be rearranged during deck - stacking .
( This no longer holds true if the deck is shuffled )
This rule ensures that cards like Condemn or Psychotic Episode do not become dead : cards sent to the bottom will stay at the bottom ( unless your opponent has a Greenseeker ) .
Unfortunately , this rule makes other cards dead : cards like Sensei ’s Divining Top or Sage of Epityr .
Too bad , I guess you ’ll just have to live with that .
• As was said before , deck - stacking takes place at any time and is an action that does n’t interact with the rest of the game : it does n’t use the stack and you can do it when you do n’t have priority .
Just treat it as though you got the topdeck you needed every time .
Everything else in Magic applies : you can still deck , even though you only start with 25 cards in your library ( I ’ll go into milling as a strategy later . )
The only other difference with regular Magic is the difference in life totals at the beginning of the game .
Why this is a good game
The inspiration for this game came from MindMasters .
After my Dad and I won some packs at the Time Spiral prerelease , I figured it was a good time to try MindMasters .
I suggested it and we played a few games of it .
It was okay .
We had fun .
We found it had a flaw , though : much of the game rested on what you opened in the pack , and there was too much hidden information for the game to be very skill - intensive .
So my Dad thought about it and came up with this game .
We dubbed it MindBusters , due to the effect it will have on your brain when you try to think the whole game through .
The reason this game is a good game and you should try it is because it has next to no luck .
Everything is laid out in plain sight .
If one pack happens to contain Umezawa ’s Jitte , it wo n’t be whoever opened the pack that will win .
It will probably be the one who bids nineteen first ( Wandering Ones begins to look good . )
The game is self - balancing and you need no longer lose games to bad topdecks .
Every pair of packs is its own format .
How “ good ” a card is depends entirely upon the other cards available .
Sengir Nosferatu can be insane , but it wo n’t be quite as insane when there ’s a Sudden Death in the same pack .
If , however , they are in different packs , they will both instantly become first picks .
Hate - drafting also becomes a potent strategy .
If you can get both the Disenchant and the Verdant Embrace , you ’ll be pretty happy , even if there are no other targets for your Disenchant .
The only luck in the game is :
• When a card like Stitch in Time or Hypnotic Specter is in one of the packs .
• In the face - down cards that were drafted : you only get to see the other guy ’s pick after you have chosen your own .
• In the hidden information that is the other player ’s hand .
But honestly , the luck is so minimal that you can probably live with it .
Another reason this is a good game is because each format is self - balancing .
Yes , cards like Mystical Teachings can be pretty worthless , but you can try to avoid them through skillful betting at the beginning .
Strategy
As I said , there is no way of judging individual cards , as the other cards in the pack determine their value .
However , there are a few things to look out for :
• The biggest creature in the two packs .
• The biggest flying creature in the two packs .
• Powerful , game - dominating cards .
( Verdant Embrace )
• Ways of dealing with powerful , game - dominating cards .
( Disenchant )
• Cards that will win you the game single - handedly .
( Door to Nothingness )
• Cards that can deal with anything that comes their way .
( Mortify )
Why am I so obsessed with Verdant Embrace and Disenchant ?
Because in one of the games I played , those two cards were in the same pack .
At about fifth pick , I took the Disenchant and expected him to take the Verdant Embrace … but he did n’t .
As you might imagine , I took it and crushed him with it .
It was a pretty easy victory .
Why Milling Does n’t Usually Work
Only 25 cards in your library …
Should n’t be milling be pretty easy ?
Well , it ’s not .
The fact is , players will always be able to curve out and make very aggressive starts .
You do n’t want to be wasting your early - drops and cards on mill spells .
Neither do you want to be using your early picks on Screeching Slivers while the other player is taking Keldon Halberdiers .
Many times have I tried milling : once with a Screeching Sliver and some other slivers , another time with Magus of the Jar , a third time with Ancestral Vision and Careful Consideration .
It has nearly always failed .
When you open a pack with Glimpse the Unthinkable and six targeted draw spells , then we ’ll talk .
Just do n’t open Consult the Necrosages and think , “ Ooh … it says ‘ Target Player ’ !
Oh boy ! ”
Do yourself a favor .
Do n’t waste your picks and your curve on mill cards .
It wo n’t work .
It ’s not worth it .
I learned that the hard way .
Card advantage in MindBusters
Part of the reason card drawing was so good in regular Magic was because it got you closer to your good cards .
That is no longer relevant .
Now , if you want to draw your good cards , just put them on top of your deck .
So does card advantage serve any purpose anymore ?
The answer is yes , it does .
Card advantage will simply give you a greater amount of resources with which to work .
You will end up with more mana , more creatures , and more tricks than your opponent .
It is , however , slightly worse than it used to be .
Card selection , however , is completely worthless .
Sorry , Looter il - Kor .
MindBusting in MindBusters
The reason this game is called what it is is because as soon as the packs are laid out , you could potentially anticipate the entire game ; however , this is next to impossible .
You must simply do your best to figure out what are going to be the most powerful cards and draft accordingly .
If you think it all through , the complexity of each game will be overwhelming .
Sample Game
Enough with the rules and the strategy .
Here are some genuine games my father and I played , so you can get better acquainted with the functioning of the game .
The two packs are opened .
Here they are :
Pack 1 :
Feldon ’s Cane
Gauntlet of Power
Riftwing Cloudskate
Haunting Hymn
Plated Pegasus
Greenseeker
Ancient Grudge
Momentary Blink
Screeching Sliver
Savage Thallid
Orcish Cannonade
Scarwood Treefolk
Spiketail Drakeling
Gorgon Recluse
Castle Raptors
Pack 2 :
Pendelhaven
Hypergenesis
Barbed Shocker
Chronatog Totem
Duskrider Peregrine
Skulking Knight
Zealot il - Vec
Urborg Syphon- Mage
Snapback
Wormwood Dryad
AEther Web
Mystical Teachings
Two - Headed Sliver
Prismatic Lens
Clockspinning
So , what to do ?
I was looking at the packs and decided that the cards that were going to dominate the game were all big fliers .
Duskrider Peregrine , Castle Raptors , Spiketail Drakeling and Riftwing Cloudskate were the game - deciders .
When aerial combat ensued , I would want a combat trick to tip the scales in my favor .
I then saw Momentary Blink , not only a combat trick , but a recurring one , and one that could combo with Riftwing Cloudskate .
I bid one life , and soon topped the bid with two .
My Dad had nothing to say , so I chose pack 1 to pick from first .
The Drafting
First picks :
Momentary Blink
Duskrider Peregrine
Second Picks :
Snapback
Castle Raptors
Here , I did n’t care if he took Castle Raptors or Riftwing Cloudskate ; taking the Castle Raptors would mean depriving me of both 3/3 fliers , but giving me an awesome combo , and taking the Riftwing Cloudskate would mean neither would happen .
Third Picks :
Riftwing Cloudskate
Zealot il - Vec
I was hoping he would n’t take the Zealot il - Vec , but he went ahead and took it anyway .
It had the ability to put the third damage on either of his 3/3s , an ability I needed .
It also can kill Screeching Sliver , a milling engine on which an eye should be kept .
Fourth Picks :
AEther Web
Savage Thallid
AEther Web can do the third damage , but it wo n’t stay , so it is n’t as good as the Zealot .
If it is put on a fatty , the fatty would gain the ability to block fliers , which could also be very important .
However , my Dad ’s pick was one of the two fattest creatures in the packs , which is unfortunate .
The other fatty is Scarwood Treefolk , a card I am going to want .
Fifth Picks :
Spiketail Drakeling
Pendelhaven
Despite Scarwood Treefolk ’s presence , I took the Drakeling because I felt the fliers would be the creatures that won the game .
As for my father ’s pick , I ca n’t say I understood it ; the only explanation was that he wanted to pump Screeching Sliver beyond Orcish Cannonade range .
Sixth Picks :
Orcish Cannonade
Wormwood Dryad
Removal and evasion are as good as they have always been .
These picks make sense to me .
Seventh Picks :
Scarwood Treefolk
Skulking Knight
I ended up with the Treefolk anyway , to my relief .
My Dad took the Skulking Knight , which I had a hard time understanding .
Eighth Picks :
Urborg Syphon- Mage
Feldon ’s Cane
Feldon ’s Cane had been an interesting card from the beginning .
In addition to the obvious use as a milling foil , it can be used as a Reclaim on steroids .
It allows you to get all the cards you lost back into your library , where you draw them all one by one .
I was a bit worried by the prospect of him replaying his Duskrider Peregrine and his Castle Raptors after I got them into the graveyard using a barrage of tricks .
I decided I would try to be as aggressive as possible so as to kill him before he could pull that off .
Ninth Picks :
Gauntlet of Power
Chronatog Totem
I was noticing the fact that I was the one with the only good blue creatures .
Gauntlet of Power seemed to be the best option for inflicting the third point of damage .
Tenth Picks :
Barbed Shocker
Ancient Grudge
So much for my Gauntlet of Power .
Eleventh Picks :
Haunting Hymn
Two - Headed Sliver
Haunting Hymn is a very powerful card and it is a testament to the sheer power of Pack 1 that I was able to take it eleventh pick .
If they have n’t already emptied their hand by turn six , you can force them to , and if they have , you can make them dump their draw , a draw that might have been instrumental to their victory .
Two - Headed Sliver was one of the milling strategy components .
Now that my Dad has his hands on Two - Headed Sliver , Screeching Sliver , Feldon ’s Cane , and Orcish Cannonade , I may be in trouble .
Twelfth Picks :
Clockspinning
Screeching Sliver
Yep , he took the final piece of the combo , while I had to content myself with a spore counter remover .
Bah .
Thirteenth Picks :
Plated Pegasus
Prismatic Lens
A flier that can reduce Orcish Cannonade ’s sting .
Not bad for a thirteenth pick .
Fourteenth Picks :
Hypergenesis
Gorgon Recluse
Gorgon Recluse is a very decent 2/4 with infinite power against other creatures .
He becomes much better when accompanied by Greenseeker , but that union was not to be .
As to Hypergenesis , I think it is a much cooler card than Mystical Teachings .
Fifteenth Picks :
Greenseeker
Mystical Teachings
Greenseeker would have gone great with Gorgon Recluse , but as is , she ’s just an Eager Cadet .
Oh , well .
I add 3 Islands , 2 Plains , 2 Forests , 2 Swamps , and 1 Mountain to my deck .
He adds 3 Mountains , 2 Plains , 2 Forests , 2 Swamps , and 1 Island to his deck .
The Game
My father chooses to play first .
Our opening hands are :
My hand
Island
Island
Forest
Plains
Riftwing Cloudskate
Spiketail Drakeling
Momentary Blink
His hand
Island
Plains
Mountain
Screeching Sliver
Prismatic Lens
Two - Headed Sliver
Duskrider Peregrine
He plays an Island followed by a Screeching Sliver and passes the turn .
I draw Scarwood Treefolk , play Island and pass the turn .
18-20
He draws Castle Raptors , plays a Plains and suspends his Duskrider Peregrine , then passes the turn .
I draw Snapback , play a Forest and suspend Riftwing Cloudskate .
At the end of my turn , he mills away my Barbed Shocker .
18-20
He draws Orcish Cannonade , plays a Mountain and taps it for a Two - Headed Sliver , and passes the turn .
I draw Wormwood Dryad , play Island and tap it for Spiketail Drakeling .
At the end of my turn , Mountain gets milled away .
18-20
He draws Mountain , plays it and plays a Prismatic Lens , then taps it and the two mountains to Cannonade my Spiketail Drakeling .
I decide not to sacrifice the Drakeling , figuring I ’m better off with him at 17 , despite the extra card .
He draws Pendelhaven .
I draw Urborg Syphon - Mage , play Plains and use it to play Scarwood Treefolk .
At the end of my turn , I pitch Hypergenesis and Greenseeker .
18-17
In his upkeep , the final time counter is removed from Duskrider Peregrine ; he attacks with it after drawing Feldon ’s Cane .
He plays Pendelhaven , Castle Raptors and Feldon ’s Cane .
My Riftwing Cloudskate comes in , returning the Castle Raptors .
I draw Swamp and attack with Scarwood Treefolk and Riftwing Cloudskate .
I play Swamp , then Urborg Syphon - Mage .
At the end of my turn , I lose Clockspinning and Island .
I have 8 cards in my library and 3 in my hand ( Wormwood Dryad , Momentary Blink , Snapback ) .
He has 13 cards in his library and only Castle Raptors in his hand .
15 -12
He draws Chronatog Totem and leaves only his Pendelhaven untapped to play Castle Raptors .
At the end of his turn , however , I Momentary Blink my Riftwing Cloudskate , allowing me to bounce his Castle Raptors .
I draw AEther Web and Snapback his Duskrider Peregrine , leaving only his two slivers to stave off my incoming horde .
I attack with Scarwood Treefolk , Riftwing Cloudskate and Urborg Syphon - Mage .
He blocks Urborg Syphon - Mage with Two - Headed Sliver and makes it a 2/3 with Pendelhaven , but I AEther Web the Syphon - Mage .
He taps the Two - Headed Sliver to mill away my Gauntlet of Power and takes 5 .
He also mills my Forest at end of turn .
I now have only 4 cards left in my library ( Haunting Hymn , Swamp , Plated Pegasus , Plains ) and one in hand ( Wormwood Dryad ) .
He has 12 cards in his library and 3 cards in his hand ( Castle Raptors , Duskrider Peregrine , Chronatog Totem ) .
Things are looking in my favor at this point , though , as his life total is rapidly shrinking .
15-7
He draws Mountain , plays it and plays Chronatog Totem , then uses it to play Castle Raptors .
He passes the turn .
I draw Swamp , play it , flashback Momentary Blink on my Riftwing Cloudskate , return Castle Raptors , and attack with Scarwood Treefolk and Urborg Syphon - Mage .
He blocks Scarwood Treefolk with Screeching Sliver and mills my Plains .
15 -4
During his own upkeep , he sacrifices Feldon ’s Cane to shuffle Screeching Sliver , Two - Headed Sliver and Orcish Cannonade back into his library .
He draws Screeching Sliver and plays it alongside Castle Raptors , then passes the turn .
I draw Haunting Hymn and use Urborg Syphon - Mage ’s ability , discarding Haunting Hymn , and pass the turn .
17-2
He draws Two - Headed Sliver , plays it , and mills my last card , Plated Pegasus , using Screeching Sliver .
In my upkeep , I discard Wormwood Dryad to Urborg Syphon - Mage ’s ability and siphon him for the kill .
Good game !
So , what is to be learned from this game ?
Well , for one thing , this further supports my point about how milling is a bad strategy .
However , he came dangerously close to decking me , as I had to kill him in my upkeep .
It was very foolhardy of me to have let him take Orcish Cannonade , Feldon ’s Cane , Two - Headed Sliver and Screeching Sliver .
When I took Barbed Shocker tenth pick the obvious good move would have been to take the Two - Headed Sliver instead , a blunder that almost cost me the game ( I had forgotten Two - Headed Sliver could inherit Screeching Sliver ’s ability ! ) .
Had a few things gone a bit differently , I could have easily lost .
Even though milling is bad , one should never completely ignore it .
Sample Game 2
On to the next game .
Pack 1 :
Krosan Cloudscraper
Triskelavus
Riftwing Cloudskate
Evil Eye of Urborg
Barbed Shocker
Think Twice
Glass Asp
Prismatic Lens
Ground Rift
Penumbra Spider
Errant Doomsayers
Traitor ’s Clutch
D’Avenant Healer
Rift Bolt
Tendrils of Corruption
Pack 2 :
Orcish Librarian
Pardic Dragon
Volcanic Awakening
Sulfurous Blast
Duskrider Peregrine
Goblin Skycutter
Crookclaw Transmuter
Strength in Numbers
Urborg Syphon- Mage
Sage of Epityr
Divine Congregation
Mindlash Sliver
Thallid Shell - Dweller
Jhoira ’s Timebug
Zealot il - Vec
Wow .
These are nice packs .
Pardic Dragon , Krosan Cloudscraper , Triskelavus , Riftwing Cloudskate , Duskrider Peregrine , Sulfurous Blast , and quite a lot of other removal …
With three huge expensive guys , this is probably going to be a war between bombs .
There is little chance that one could beat down and kill the opponent with fast creatures before the bombs come online , especially with Thallid Shell - Dweller present .
So , what to do ?
The only way to kill the fliers is through some combination of Sulfurous Blast , Rift Bolt , and Goblin Skycutter .
These packs are quite similar to the last two in that they share a lot of cards , but the presence of bombs and the abundance of removal will make the strategies completely different .
The only combat trick is Strength in Numbers , so there are few ways to tip combat in your favor should Triskelavus and Pardic Dragon end up in close combat .
There is also Krosan Cloudscraper to think about , a creature so fat that if you can get him out , you will have won the game .
After thinking about all these things , my attention was grabbed by the seemingly harmless card Volcanic Awakening .
If one could time suspend cards right , one could wreck an opponent who planned on making it to six mana and playing Pardic Dragon .
I would have to go first to pull it off , so I could get to six mana before him .
It seemed a good plan , so I bet one .
After my bid went unanswered , I chose to choose whether or not to go first , he chose pack 2 , and the game had begun !
The Drafting
First picks :
Riftwing Cloudskate
Pardic Dragon
Riftwing Cloudskate was going to be a very powerful card here because of his ability to bounce a bomb should my plan go awry in addition to being a suspend card and an all - around awesome creature .
Now that he had the Pardic Dragon and , soon enough , Triskelavus , I had to follow through with my plan or I would lose .
Second Picks :
Sulfurous Blast
Triskelavus
My decision was between Duskrider Peregrine and Sulfurous Blast .
I knew that whichever I took , he would take the other .
I wanted the Duskrider Peregrine , but I knew that Sulfurous Blast could devastate my army after I Volcanic Awakened , and it could prove very useful should he suddenly decide to go beatdown .
I was considering taking Volcanic Awakening right here and now , but I doubted my father had seen the same thing as I had and would take it from me .
Third Picks :
Rift Bolt
Duskrider Peregrine
Rift Bolt , in addition to being a great piece of removal , would up my storm count when turn six came along .
Fourth Picks :
Goblin Skycutter
Tendrils of Corruption
Again , the dilemma of whether or not to take the Awakening now or later .
I decided to take a risk and grab the good 2 - drop and piece of removal Goblin Skycutter .
I was a bit sad I could n’t take all the removal , for now Tendrils of Corruption was in enemy hands .
Fifth Picks :
Krosan Cloudscraper
Zealot il - Vec
I decided I wanted Krosan Cloudscraper as a finisher and as a useful 2 /2 for 3 .
I was unhappy he had taken Zealot il - Vec .
That was a creature that could take down Goblin Skycutter , among other things , and meant I needed to find myself a new 2 - drop .
Sixth Picks :
Volcanic Awakening
Prismatic Lens
I decided not to postpone taking Volcanic Awakening any longer .
When he took Prismatic Lens , at first , I panicked .
That would mean he could play Pardic Dragon before I could destroy his lands !
I soon realized , however , that Riftwing Cloudskate could bounce the Pardic Dragon back to his hand and bail me out .
Seventh Picks :
Penumbra Spider
Crookclaw Transmuter
I wanted a 4 - drop , and Penumbra Spider seemed to be the best one .
Again , I was unhappy with what he picked .
The Crookclaw Transmuter meant I would have to look beyond Thallid Shell - Dweller for my 2 - drop .
Eighth Picks :
Thallid Shell - Dweller
Barbed Shocker
Oh well , I can at least wait until he plays Crookclaw Transmuter to play my Thallid Shell - Dweller .
I seemed better off taking that than Urborg Syphon - Mage or Strength in Numbers .
Barbed Shocker ?
I do n’t understand .
Ninth Picks :
Errant Doomsayers
Urborg Syphon- Mage
I finally found my 2 - drop !
Hooray !
Errant Doomsayers also means I have nothing to fear from Zealot il - Vec .
Tenth Picks :
Strength in Numbers
Traitor ’s Clutch
Strength in Numbers was the last decent card of the pack .
Traitor ’s Clutch was potentially very dangerous .
Eleventh Picks :
Evil Eye of Urborg
Divine Congregation
I have always somewhat liked Evil Eye of Urborg , and here there ’s no risk of it being temporally isolated .
Twelfth Picks :
Jhoira ’s Timebug
D’Avenant Healer
I simply took the fattest creature in my pack , and that was Jhoira ’s Timebug .
I was a little worried about D’Avenant Healer tormenting me during combat , but the double - white cost and his lack of early creatures meant things could n’t get too bad .
Thirteenth Picks :
Glass Asp
Mindlash Sliver
Again , I took the fattest creature in my pack .
Fourteenth Picks :
Orcish Librarian
Ground Rift
1/1 for 2 vs. 1/1 for 1 with a drawback .
Hmmm …
Fifteenth Picks :
Think Twice
Sage of Epityr
I add 3 Mountains , 3 Forests , 2 Islands , 1 Plains , and 1 Swamp to my deck .
He adds 4 Swamps , 3 Mountains , 2 Plains , and 1 Island to his deck .
The Game
I choose to play first .
Our opening hands are :
My hand
Island
Plains
Forest
Forest
Riftwing Cloudskate
Errant Doomsayers
Penumbra Spider
His hand
Swamp
Mountain
Plains
Mindlash Sliver
Duskrider Peregrine
Divine Congregation
Prismatic Lens
I play a Plains and pass the turn .
He draws Island , plays a Swamp followed by a Mindlash Sliver and passes the turn .
19 -20
I draw Think Twice , play a Forest and an Errant Doomsayers , and pass the turn .
He draws Tendrils of Corruption , attacks with Mindlash Sliver , plays a Plains , suspends Duskrider Peregrine and passes the turn .
18-20
I draw Rift Bolt , play an Island , suspend Riftwing Cloudskate , and pass the turn .
He draws Mountain , plays it and plays Prismatic Lens , which he uses to suspend Divine Congregation .
I tap his Mindlash Sliver in his main phase .
He passes the turn .
18-20
I draw Mountain , attack with Errant Doomsayers , and play Forest and Penumbra Spider .
I pass the turn .
He draws Crookclaw Transmuter and plays Island .
There is one counter on his Duskrider Peregrine and four on his Divine Congregation .
18-19
I draw Volcanic Awakening .
I play Mountain and suspend Rift Bolt , then pass the turn .
At the end of my turn , he flashes out Crookclaw Transmuter .
There is one counter on Riftwing Cloudskate and one on Rift Bolt .
It looks like my plan is going to work !
During his upkeep , Duskrider Peregrine comes into play .
He draws Pardic Dragon , plays Mountain , and plays the Dragon .
In his combat step , I tap his Crookclaw Transmuter , and at the end of his turn , I Think Twice , drawing Mountain .
Normally , I do n’t like to use bad card drawing like Think Twice .
I have nothing against card drawing in MindBusters , but I do n’t want to play 5 mana just for 1 extra card !
I much prefer a card like Fathom Seer , who costs no mana .
He ’ll hurt your mana development slightly , but with an aggressively - minded strategy you ’ll just replay your lands and play cheaper spells while you wait , all while having given you more creatures to work with .
Anyhow , I played Think Twice there because I had nothing else to do with my mana and felt I should do something .
While we ’re on the subject of card - drawing , another card that deserves honorable mention is Ophidian Eye .
Ophidian Eye on a creature like Shadow Sliver will draw you many , many cards for only 3 mana !
You will have plenty of options , while your opponent is left in the dust .
That card defeated me .
But back to the game …
18-19
During my upkeep , Rift Bolt zaps Duskrider Peregrine , and Riftwing Cloudskate comes in and bounces Pardic Dragon .
I draw Thallid Shell - Dweller .
I play Volcanic Awakening and destroy both his Mountains and his Plains .
It worked !
He will have a hard time recovering , as he must waste precious time getting his lands back .
I attack with my Penumbra Spider and my Riftwing Cloudskate .
He draws a third Mountain , plays it , and plays Tendrils of Corruption on my Errant Doomsayers with one Swamp out .
I respond by tapping his Crookclaw Transmuter .
He attacks me with his Mindlash Sliver .
17-16
I draw Krosan Cloudscraper , play it face - down , play Thallid Shell - Dweller , and attack with Riftwing Cloudskate and Penumbra Spider .
He does n’t block .
He draws Plains , plays it , plays Zealot ¬il - Vec , and attacks with Crookclaw Transmuter .
14-12
I draw Goblin Skycutter and attack with Morph , Penumbra Spider , and Riftwing Cloudskate .
He does n’t block .
He is at six .
I play Goblin Skycutter .
He gains ten life from Divine Congregation targeting me , draws Swamp , plays it , and attacks with Zealot il - Vec and Crookclaw Transmuter .
He targets Goblin Skycutter with Zealot il - Vec ’s ability , and I chuck the Goblin in response at Crookclaw Transmuter , saving me three damage .
He plays the Syphon - Mage .
At the end of his turn , I flashback Think Twice , drawing Strength in Numbers .
14-16
I draw Jhoira ’s Timebug and attack with Morph , Penumbra Spider , and Riftwing Cloudskate .
He does n’t block .
I play the Timebug .
He draws Swamp and plays it .
Because he only has three mountains in his deck , he has to use the Prismatic Lens to play Pardic Dragon , meaning he will need seven mana !
14-10
I attack with everyone , he chump - blocks Penumbra Spider with Mindlash Sliver , but it is not enough to postpone his death in the face of a Strength in Numbers .
Good game !
We can see from this game that seemingly bad cards can become good when in the right format , and whenever you play a game of MindBusters , it will often be necessary to reassess the power level of every card .
Finding hidden synergies among cards and being able to see which ones will determine the winner is necessary to win .
You may find some play errors among these games .
( I saw a few ! )
My father and I are very far from being great Magic players , and regularly make mistakes .
Despite the changes to Magic that MindBusters includes , it still feels like Magic , and despite the tremendous amount of thought that goes into each of these games , it is still a lot of fun .
In fact , I personally would n’t mind having sanctioned tournaments that include rounds of this game .
I think it will eliminate some of Magic ’s luck elements while still preserving its flavor .
It stands in a category of its own , as neither limited nor constructed .
Try it , you ’ll like it !

Learn from your mistakes is good advice , but learn from other people ’s mistakes is even better .
I ’ve been investing since 1996 .
In the process , I have learned a lot , mainly from trial and error .
Today , I ’d like to share some of the mistakes I ’ve made when I was a newbie investor , along with some pitfalls I have managed to avoid along the way .
Now with more experience under my belt , I ’ll show you how to avoid these mistakes and pitfalls .
I will also share some tools that I use today to help me with investing .
Hopefully , you can learn from them and save yourself some trouble .
1. Start Investing Late
I started a part - time job during my first year in college around 1991 .
If I had known what I know today , I would have invested money in an IRA from day one .
But like many other young adults , I was thrilled to have money and spent it all on things that I enjoyed — e.g. , movies , games , electronics , etc .
Take a look at this chart .
It shows the difference in wealth accumulated by the age of 65 by investing $ 1,200 a year at an 8 % growth rate when you start at 20 vs. 30 vs. 40 vs. 50 years old .
How to Avoid this Mistake
Start investing as early as you possibly can .
If I had invested just $ 2,000 per year while I was in college , that $ 8,000 invested in an S&P 500 index fund would be worth about $ 58,000 today ( 23 years later ) .

2. Not Knowing the Basics
In the beginning , I did n’t know anything about investing or the stock market .
All I knew was that I should invest money to make more money .
My first move was to give my money to a full - service brokerage firm to invest on my behalf .
This was a big mistake since each trade made by my broker costs a lot of money .
And as it turned out , the mutual funds he picked were subpar and expensive house - brand mutual funds .
How to Avoid this Mistake
Start by learning about the basics of investing before you do anything .
Choose a low - cost broker to work with , and start by investing in low - cost index ETFs .
I think today ’s investors are lucky because useful information is so much more prevalent .
Also , there are many low - cost brokerages now , even ones that offer free trading like M1 Finance , compared to the choices I had in 1995 .
3. Chasing Past Performances
Once I got smart enough to switch to a discount broker , I committed another mistake .
I chose mutual funds based on their past performance and Morningstar rating .
The truth is top - performing funds in the current year tend to lag behind the market in the subsequent years .
All I did was to buy at the high points for a statistically lower chance of beating the market .
Here is a chart from the study done by S&P Global :
How to Avoid this Mistake
Instead of choosing investments based on past performance , start by identifying your investment goals .
For each goal , identify the best investment account , e.g. , taxable account vs. IRA or 401 ( k ) vs. HSA , and then build a properly allocated and diversified portfolio using index funds to meet each goal .
Your passively managed index funds are statistically more likely to outperform actively managed funds .
If you ’re uncertain , ask someone more experienced or consult a financial planner .
4. Not Paying Attention to Asset Allocation
When I started , my investment was mainly in large - capitalization U.S. stocks and funds .
I did not know about asset allocation as a risk management and performance enhancement tool .
It was n’t until 1999 — when I became eligible for a 401 ( k ) — that was when I learned about asset allocation and came to appreciate its power .
How to Avoid this Mistake
In my opinion , asset allocation is the best way to build a long - term portfolio .
Figure out the right asset allocation mix for you and invest according to your asset allocation plan .
5. Ignoring Diversification
Again , with little experience and little money to invest , I was going after individual stocks and did not pay any attention to diversification .
Like asset allocation , it took me a long time to realize how diversification helps to reduce risk and enhance performance .
The value of diversification became apparent to me at about the same time that asset allocation did .
These days , I stopped investing in individual stocks altogether and choose to invest in just a handful of ETFs .
How to Avoid this Mistake
The first step is to invest in ETFs , which is a big basket of stocks , instead of investing in individual stocks .
The second step is to invest across asset classes , globally , and in different sectors .
You can use tools like Personal Capital and Portfolio X - Ray Tool to check your asset allocation and diversification quickly .
6. Not Paying Attention to Expenses
I did not realize how badly expense ratios can affect investment performance .
When I started investing , there were no ETFs .
Worst yet , mutual funds commonly charge front - end load ( they take money when you buy ) and redemption fee ( they take money when you sell ) .
Moreover , the expense ratios in the 1 % range were the norm .
I always thought “ it ’s only 1 % , what ’s the difference , ” and went for the investment with better performance .
I finally ran some numbers , and I was shocked to learn that a difference of 1 % can lower my investment performance by hundreds of thousands over the course of 30 years .
Instead of ending up with $ 1 million , for example , I might only have $ 825,000 .
How to Avoid this Mistake
The good news is expense ratio has been decreasing steadily over the years , and most investors should be able to keep their portfolio well below 0.35 % these days .
You can use a tool like Personal Capital to analyze your investment expenses .
Once all your accounts are linked , Personal Capital gives you a list of all your holdings , the expense ratios , and how much you pay each year .
You can trade out investments with the highest expense ratio and swap them for lower - cost equivalents .
7. Not Paying Attention to Distributions
This is another issue that I did not pay attention to back then .
I held some mutual funds in my taxable account .
For a couple of years , I thought high distributions were really cool because I was making more money .
How silly was that ?
Now I realize that I was paying taxes needlessly .
Also , it was possible to invest in a mutual fund , see the share price ( NAV ) drops , and get capital gains distribution which you have to pay taxes for .
Now , I invest mostly with ETFs , which are a lot more tax - efficient than mutual funds .
Also , most of my money is in an IRA , so I do n’t have to worry as much about taxable distributions .
How to Avoid this Mistake
ETFs help reduces this problem substantially .
However , you still need to pay attention to your investments that are in a taxable account .
You should invest in low dividend , low distribution , and low turnover funds in your taxable accounts .
8. Experimenting with My IRA
Back then , I had tons of ideas , but no money .
Most of my money was invested in an IRA — so I experimented using my retirement money .
That was a big mistake !
First , money lost in an IRA can not be replenished .
I was allowed to deposit $ 2,000 per year at that time , and that was it .
Now , the limit is much higher at $ 6,000 , but I would still advise not to play around with money in your IRA .
Second , I could not claim my losses as tax deductions .
Since the IRA was tax - sheltered , the loss was simply a loss .
How to Avoid this Mistake
It is so easy now to experiment with very little money using a free trading platform like M1 Finance .
You can experiment with different investing strategies and not having to worry about trading costs .
When you ’re in the experimentation phase , it is better to use a taxable account so that you can perform tax - loss harvesting on your portfolio .
Here is my little experiment portfolio : My M1 Finance Dividend Income Portfolio .
9. Selling Winners and Keeping Losers
This was my all - time weakness .
I knew the concept of “ buy low and sell high . ”
So with the little experience I had , I ended up selling a lot of my winners like Staples ( SPLS ) , Ameritrade ( AMTD ) , and Microsoft ( MSFT ) to lock in the gain .
But I held on to my losers like Flemings and eToys ( they do n’t exist anymore ) .
Not only did I hold on to my losers longer than I should , but I also bought more shares in the hope of lowering my cost basis .
This sounds good in theory , but it does n’t work well with individual stocks that require more in - depth research compared to investment funds .
How to Avoid this Mistake
When you buy index ETFs , you do n’t have to worry as much about owning an absolute loser that will go down to zero .
If you follow your asset allocation plan and rebalance your portfolio regularly , you will automatically sell a bit of the winners and buy a bit of the losers ; but this is okay because you ’re not exiting any position , you ’re just buying low and selling high in small increments .
However , if you insist on investing in individual stocks , make sure you know how to perform research about the company .
Remember you ’re not buying shares , you ’re buying a piece of a business , and you have to understand how the business is doing and its outlook .
If the stock starts to tank , you have to redo your research to see if it is the right move to invest more money , or if it is better to sell it off .
10 . Investing without a Goal
When I started , I was investing just to invest and make money .
Without a clear goal , I was chasing short - term performance and was prone to act on market swings .
Around 2007 , with my son ’s arrival , I became more purposeful with my financial goals .
For example , my wife and I set up goals to build a $ 1 million investment portfolio in 10 years , set up our son ’s college education fund , help my parents with investing for their retirements , etc .
How to Avoid this Mistake
These longer - term goals , and shorter - term goals like saving for a downpayment , compete for the same limited amount of money that you have .
To be a successful investor , you need to have a plan and invest according to the plan .
It worth spending time to figure out all the things you want to accomplish , prioritize them , and put together an action plan to achieve each goal .

11 . Selling on Corrections
These are symptoms of not having a clear goal .
Since I was chasing short - term performance to make more money .
I occasionally gave in to my emotion and sold my investments during corrections to protect my gains .
Sometimes , I ’d come out ahead by sheer luck , but most of the time , I ended up rushing back to reinvest my money as the market invariably rose after these corrections .
How to Avoid this Mistake
If you have a good plan and set up the right asset allocation , you should be able to weather all the ups and downs .
There are also strategies to help you perform better during market corrections and bear markets .

More Retirement Savings Pitfalls
1. Leaving Money on the Table
Many companies offer matching contributions for their 401 ( k ) plan .
This is virtually free money , an instant return on investment .
If your employer offers a 401 ( k ) match , you need to make this your top priority .
Do whatever you can to get all of the matching contributions , even if it means delaying other financial goals .
In my 401(k ) Plan article , I demonstrated how contributing to 401 ( k ) to get the match should even take priority over paying down debt !
2. Not Increasing Your Contribution
As you get your pay raises , you should try to keep your living expenses the same and increase your retirement savings .
Many people make the mistake of spending their raises before they even get them .
Also , remember that 401( k ) and IRA contribution limits tend to go up each year .
If you ’re in the position to max out your contributions , your raise should first go toward meeting these limits .
3. Borrowing from Your 401( k )
Most 401 k plans allow you to borrow against it .
However , you should avoid this pitfall .
Here are some reasons why :
Some plans do not allow you to contribute while you have a loan outstanding .
You disrupt your investment growth .
If you quit or lose your job , you will have to pay the remaining balance right away or risk paying the 10 % early withdrawal penalty .
4. Cashing Out Early
This is a huge mistake .
Cashing out of 401 ( k ) or IRA before the eligible ages of 55 and 59 ½ ( respectively ) will result in a 10 % early withdrawal penalty , on top of the income taxes you have to pay on the withdrawn amount .
Whatever you do , you should not touch your retirement funds until you reach the eligible age .
If you change employer , you have three choices to avoid cashing out :
Keep your money in the old employer ’s 401( k ) plan
Roll your money into new employer ’s 401( k ) plan
Roll your money into your own Rollover IRA account
5. Investing Too Conservatively
I cringe every time I hear my colleagues invest their entire retirement savings in a Bonds fund , or worse yet , keep it in cash .
For young investors , it will be decades before they withdraw money from 401( k ) .
Even for people who are near retirement , their retirement may last 20 or more years .
With retirement savings , you should invest as aggressively as your ability , willingness , and need to take risk allowed .
At the very least , put your money in a Target Date Fund .
Otherwise , your investment may not grow quickly enough to support your retirement .
The rule of thumb is you should have at least 120 minus your age as a percentage of investment allocated to stocks .
For example , I am 45 now so I should have at least 75 % ( 120 – 45 ) of my retirement savings invested in Stocks and 25 % in Bonds and Cash .
Currently , I am even more aggressively invested in the stock market than this .
You can also use the Investment Checkup Tool in Personal Capital to see how your portfolio compares to the recommended allocation .
6. Not Looking at Your Entire Portfolio
If you currently have several investment portfolios , you should look at your asset allocation and diversification across all of them as a whole .
It ’s easy to miss this point and just treat each portfolio as a separate entity .
You can use tools like Personal Capital and Portfolio X - Ray Tool to check your asset allocation and diversification across multiple accounts easily .
7. Investing in Your Company ’s Stocks
Unless you can buy your company ’s stocks at a deep discount or you can get them for free , you should not buy your company ’s stocks .
There are many reasons why this is a bad idea :
If your company tanked , you lose both your job and your investment .
Individual stocks are not good for diversification .
Bottom Line
As you can see , I was not a very good investor when I started , and it took me a long time and too much money to learn from my mistakes .
I hope that by sharing these common pitfalls , you can avoid some of them on your journey .
Good luck with your investing !
CLASS , THY NAME IS RUDY ….
As part of a campaign stop planned for Iowa last week , Rudy Giuliani ’s Des Moines office called Deb and Jerry VonSprecken to see if they ’d host an event at their farm .
They agreed .
After several days of planning and a security check , though , Deb was told to call Giuliani ’s New York office :
“ They wanted to know our assets , ” she revealed , and added that she and Jerry have a modest 80 acre farm and raise cattle .
Later she received a call from Tony Delgado at the Des Monies location .
“ Tony said , ‘ I ’m sorry , you are n’t worth a million dollars and he is campaigning on the Death Tax right now . ’ then he said they were n’t going to be able to come , ” Deb continued .
The guy ’s just all class , is n’t he ?
POSTSCRIPT : So what really happened ?
It sounds like Giuliani ’s gang was playing an old time conservative game : trying to find a family farm that would eventually have to be sold in order to pay inheritance taxes .
Of course , they can practically never find one , since inheritance taxes do n’t even start to kick in until a farm is worth several million dollars , and there are n’t very many family farms worth anywhere near that .
But that does n’t keep them from trying .

has adoption become ,
a council allowed
these gay paedophiles
to foster young boys —
even , as one mother
reveals here , turning
a blind eye when
presented with
evidence of their
horrifying abuse
While the events unfolding in
her living room were tense and
awkward , the young mother
did not believe that her unease
augured anything more
inauspicious or alarming .
With the benefit of hindsight , of course , she
has now had ample time to reflect on how that
gnawing anxiety was justified .
Scroll down for more ...
Miss X , as she must be known , had placed her
eight - year - old twin boys into foster care in 2004
after finding herself unable to cope with life as a
single parent of four boisterous youngsters .
That they had been placed with a gay couple ,
Craig Faunch and Ian Wathey — the first
homosexual couple in Yorkshire to be approved by the
authorities as foster parents — was , she told
friends , incidental : she was just happy that
someone was taking good care of them .
That sentiment changed , however , when she
was shown a compromising naked photograph
of her son while they were on one of their regular
visits home .
The photo — featuring her son urinating — was
unsettling enough for Miss X to complain to the
social services department of her local council in
Wakefield , Yorkshire .
It is the sort of serious
incident that might , you imagine , herald the start of
a strict set of investigative procedures .
Instead , the matter was resolved — if that is
the correct word — over an uncomfortable
meeting in Miss X's living room in May 2004 ,
during which , she recalls , 32 - year - old Faunch
declared that he had taken the photograph to
embarrass her son into closing the door when
he went to the toilet .
The dubious explanation was enough to satisfy
the social services managers present , who
brought the inquiry to a swift conclusion ( as
well as apparently losing the incriminating
photograph in the process ) .
It was to be another
eight months before another
boy in their care was to raise
the alarm .
Eighteen months later , in
June last year , both Faunch
and Wathey were jailed for a
total of 11 years after being
convicted of a dozen offences
relating to four of the boys in
their care .
The pair had looked after 18
children in only 15 months after
being approved by the council ,
but under the guise of caring
men offering a helping hand to
disadvantaged youngsters , had
sexually abused vulnerable
children for their own gratification .
Neither man , Leeds Crown
Court was told last year , had
shown any empathy or remorse .
Both are now serving prison
sentences for their despicable
crimes .
Nonetheless , the
repercussions have continued to
rumble , and in a scathing independentlyauthored report
issued this week , Wakefield
Metropolitan District Council
found itself the subject of
robust condemnation .
They had , the report
concluded , left the couple free
to sexually abuse youngsters in
their care because of fears of
discrimination if they launched
an investigation .
By virtue of their sexuality ,
the report suggested , the men
were " trophy carers " who were
not subject to the same
rigorous assessment as others .
At a time when gay couples
can legally adopt children for
the first time , the criticism
raises serious questions about
vetting procedures , as well as
fears that the crimes of two
men could have repercussions
for genuine gay foster parents .
For Miss X , of course , the
issue is a far more simple one : a
shocking betrayal of trust .
As she says : " I was so angry
when I found out that the
council had n't taken their
investigation further and , at
least , contacted the police
about it .
" I am horrified that
they let more children go into
that house — it 's sick .
" Now , so many more people
have also had their lives turned
upside down .
" Like others , I
trusted them 100 per cent and
they let me down . "
It is a sentiment echoed by the
mothers of Faunch and Wathey's
two other young victims , not to
mention others who have found
themselves at the sharp end of
council mismanagement .
For it is not the first time that
Wakefield council has found its
provision of care for disadvantaged
young people in the spotlight for
all the wrong reasons .
Last month , six care workers
formerly employed by the
council won a compensation
payout estimated to be in the
region of £ 1 million in an out - ofcourtsettlement after blowing
the whistle on standards of
care in the children 's homes
where they worked .
All of them had been sacked
after revealing a shocking
catalogue of mismanagement , a
raft of failings which included
allowing children as young as
12 to engage in sexual
relationships , a child worker buying
and smoking drugs with
children in his care and failures in
staff criminal record checks .
Such a depressing litany of
failures would seem to have had
no bearing on sending the boys
to stay with the two men in
Sides Road , Pontefract , from
the summer of 2003 .
Faunch and Wathey had
settled in the three - bedroom
semidetached house on a pleasant
cul - de-sac five years earlier
and , like so many paedophiles ,
appeared to be perfectly
respectable members of society .
This strikingly odd couple —
40 - year - old Wathey , 6ft tall and
thick set was regarded as a
quiet , " Gentle Giant " while
Faunch is a slim 5ft 6in and
nicknamed " Tweetie Pie " at
school because of his voice and
stature — both grew up near
Wakefield , West Yorkshire .
The men were living at home
with their divorced mothers
when they met ten years ago ,
quickly coming out to their
respective friends and families
before , in 1998 , they decided to
move in together .
Money , according to friends ,
was often in short supply , with
both men undertaking a
number of distinctly mundane jobs
over the years , including
working for a local frozen food firm
and a mail order home
shopping catalogue company .
They seemed , neighbours
recall , unlikely trailblazers for
gay rights , although in fact
Faunch in particular was
outspoken on the subject .
And whether or not it was at
his behest , five years ago , the
couple applied to Wakefield
council to become professional
foster parents .
When , in July 2003 , they
received permission , Faunch
and Wathey became among the
first homosexual couples in
England to be approved , and
the first in Yorkshire .
The milestone passed quietly
enough .
Faunch and Wathey
were treated no differently to
any other foster parents by
social services , passing the
same training courses and
undergoing the same standard
vetting procedures .
Routine checks revealed they
did not have a criminal record
and had never been in trouble
with police , and , with a
desperate shortage of foster parents
in the Yorkshire area , began
their new role in the summer of
2003 as soon as the social
services fostering panel formally
approved their applications .
The couple 's request only to
look after boys in the five to 12
age bracket apparently passed
unremarked , with managers
accepting Faunch and Wathey 's explanation that they
did n't feel " equipped " to care for
girls .
Perhaps social services should
have talked to members of the
local community , many of
whom had a strong sense that
it was not pure altruism that
had persuaded the gay couple
to bring young boys into their
home .
As local gossip would
have it , it was the money .
Neither man went out to work
and appeared to be living off
funds from Wakefield 's social
services department .
Cash was used , according to
one neighbour , to fund
weekends away with the boys at the
nearby seaside resorts of
Cleethorpes and Skegness in
the motorhome they owned .
Of course , we now know that
the couple 's motivation was
even more sinister : both men
were paedophiles .
And less than a year after
they had first been approved ,
Miss X was moved to flag up
her concerns to social services .
During one of her regular visits
with the twins , a grinning
Faunch had shown her the
picture of her son urinating during
a visit to Butlin 's holiday camp
in Skegness .
A similar snap had also been
taken of the other twin .
Deeply disturbed , the 34 - yearold single mother refused to let
the twins return to the foster
home and lodged an official
complaint with the council .
But while a social worker took
the offending photograph and
promised a full investigation
the result , as we have seen , was
merely that awkward living
room meeting .
After that , Miss X was told
nothing of what happened
next , left instead to assume
that the council had
thoroughly investigated the matter .
In fact , far from taking any
further action , the council had
sent Faunch and Wathey more
youngsters , including some
with more serious problems ,
even providing extra bunk beds
and a Ford Galaxy people
carrier to assist with any
transportation problems .
" Moving
up in the world , " one neighbour
ruefully remarked .
Behind the scenes , however , it
was the couple 's deviancy that
had moved on to another level .
Among the new " recruits " to
their foster army was a 14 - year
old - boy with Asperger's
syndrome , a form of autism , who
spent the weekends with the
men to afford his mother some
respite care .
With a mental age
of seven and learning
difficulties , the boy 's 36 - year - old
mother found it hard to juggle
her son 's special needs
alongside those of her other two children - and had turned to Wakefield - social services for help .
" I was at breaking point when
Craig and Ian came along , " she
recalls .
" At the time , it was the
answer to my prayers .
" I looked after my son myself during the
week and at weekends could
recharge my batteries and
spend time with the other kids . "
How could she have guessed
that her son was being sexually
abused by the foster carers in
the privacy of their home —
knowing that he was unlikely to
say anything because of his
condition ?
In harrowing evidence given
to Leeds Crown Court last year ,
the boy recalled how Wathey
had made him watch gay
pornography while he touched
himself and , on nine other
other occasions , had also
subjected the boy to an explicit sex
act as he lay in bed , telling him
he must not tell his mother .
He had also , the boy also told
the court , been fondled on
several occasions by Faunch as
they sat on the living room sofa .
" I do n't like them anymore , " he
told the court .
" I want them to go to prison . "
Who knows how long this
catalogue of abuse may have
continued ?
In fact , it was only after
a fourth child , also aged 14 ,
reported to an adult friend that
he had been inappropriately
touched that the police
became involved .
After one of the incidents , he
told the court , he had used a
full bottle of shower gel in the
shower in a bid to scrub away
the memory of the event .
" It
hurt , " he said .
The police were finally
informed , and launched an
investigation , during which
they discovered an indecent
video of the fostered twins
taking a shower which had been
filmed just days after their
naked photo had been taken .
Police also uncovered a
hardcore gay pornographic film in
the recorder of Faunch and
Wathey 's bedroom .
The film , A Young Man's World , features
the exploits of a group of older
men lusting after and
performing sex acts with young males .
In June last year , Faunch was
convicted of five sexual
offences of sexual activity with
a 14 - year - old and two offences
of taking indecent photos .
Wathey was found guilty of
four offences of sexual activity
with another 14 - year - old boy
and a charge of encouraging a
child to watch a gay porn
movie .
Neither showed any
remorse .
Indeed , it perhaps suggests
something of the couple 's
attitude towards the legal
proceedings that just weeks
before they stood trial in June
last year , the men chose to
formalise their relationship in a
civil partnership ceremony in
Pontefract .
Little wonder that , when
sentencing Faunch and Wathey
at Leeds Crown Court last
summer , Judge Susan Cahill
said it was " quite incredible "
that the police had not been
called in after concerns were
initially raised by the mother of
the twin boys .
It is a sentiment echoed by the
authors of this week 's report , who
also made 41 recommendations
for overhauling the council's
fostering process .
Only time will tell , of course ,
whether these
recommendations will be implemented .
In the meantime , the mothers of
the boys concerned are left to
deal with the emotional
consequences behind the
bureaucratic machine .
As the mother of the 14 - year
old with Asperger 's put it .
" I
just do not know the long - term
damage this may have done to
my son .
" If social workers had
done their job and taken the
twins more seriously in the first
place , my son would never have
gone there . "
This week , a spokeswoman
for Wakefield council declined
to comment , declaring it would
be " inappropriate " to do so until
after a meeting of all council
members is held on Wednesday .
" Inappropriate " , of course ,
being rather a key word
throughout this sorry saga —
and one that should have been
used far earlier .

A new bridge has been opened a few days ago in Moscow .
It was officially named “ The Picturesque Bridge ” for its like some visual qualities .
So some young people decided to visit it and make some photos at night when its “ picturesque ” lights are on .
When they arrived and started making some photos they have discovered some shocking facts – a lot of pieces of bridge fasteners were missing !
And it was not a bridge under construction – it was officially opened and thousands of cars pass over it everyday .
Here are some of their photos :

An electron microscope photo of a nanostructure similar to that used in the experiment .
The light - grey colors show the metal structure ( made of gold ) used to create an electric trap ( white lines ) for the electrons .
A voltage ( V ) that changes with time is applied to the rightmost piece of metal .
As a result , the electron , which is locked in the right trap , feels an electric field .
This electric field causes the electron to move ( white dotted line ) , so that the position of the electron changes with time .

Researchers at the Delft University of Technology ’s Kavli Institute of Nanoscience and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter ( FOM ) have succeeded in controlling the spin of a single electron merely by using electric fields .
This clears the way for a much simpler realization of the building blocks of a ( future ) super - fast quantum computer .
The scientists will publish their work in Science Express on Thursday 1 November .
Controlling the spin of a single electron is essential if this spin is to be used as the building block of a future quantum computer .
An electron not only has a charge but , because of its spin , also behaves as a tiny magnet .
In a magnetic field , the spin can point in the same direction as the field or in the opposite direction , but the laws of quantum mechanics also allow the spin to exist in both states simultaneously .
As a result , the spin of an electron is a very promising building block for the yet - to - be - developed quantum computer ; a computer that , for certain applications , is far more powerful than a conventional computer .
At first glance it is surprising that the spin can be rotated by an electric field .
However , we know from the Theory of Relativity that a moving electron can ‘ feel ’ an electric field as though it were a magnetic field .
Researchers Katja Nowack and Dr. Frank Koppens therefore forced an electron to move through a rapidly - changing electric field .
Working in collaboration with Prof. Yuli V. Nazarov , theoretical researcher at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft , they showed that it was indeed possible to turn the spin of the electron by doing so .
The advantage of controlling spin with electric fields rather than magnetic fields is that the former are easy to generate .
It will also be easier to control various spins independently from one another - a requirement for building a quantum computer - using electric fields .
The team , led by Dr. Lieven Vandersypen , is now going to apply this technique to a number of electrons .

Federal judges are using the little known " terrorism enhancement " power – which allows them to tack years onto sentences for crimes considered to be terrorism – in cases that arguably are n't terrorist attacks , according to Shane Harris , National Journal 's enterprising national security reporter .
Harris pored over court records to look at how judges use the power to sometimes triple the jail time of people convicted of crimes that already come with stiff penalties .
There ’s no doubt about it : Daniel McGowan is a criminal .
In January 2001 , he stood lookout while other members of a radical environmentalist group set fire to the offices of the Superior Lumber Co. in the tiny southwestern Oregon town of Glendale .
In statement issued after the fire , McGowan justified the after - hours assault , calling Superior “ a typical earth raper contributing to the ecological destruction of the Northwest . ”
Five months later , in the northern town of Clatskanie , McGowan and others torched a farm that grew hybrid poplar - cottonwood trees , which they denounced in another public message as “ an ecological nightmare threatening native biodiversity in the ecosystem . ”
At the scene , McGowan painted the letters ELF , the acronym of the Earth Liberation Front , an underground band of economic saboteurs responsible for a string of arsons across the Northwest and in Colorado and Wyoming .
McGowan , fully committed to ELF ’s violent tactics , caused more than $ 2 million in property damage .
He is , by the letter of the law and by his own admission of involvement in the two fires , an arsonist .
But is Daniel McGowan a terrorist ?
As far as the law is concerned , yes .
Last month , a U.S. District Court judge in Eugene , Ore. , ruled that McGowan set the fire at the tree farm to intimidate state governments .
Specifically , the Clatskanie statement had declared , “ Pending legislation in Oregon and Washington further criminalizing direct action in defense of the wild will not stop us and only highlights the fragility of the ecocidal empire . ”
That one sentence , the judge found , showed that McGowan meant to influence the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion , a particular legal standard that elevated his crime from simple arson to terrorism .
Under the law , that gave the judge the authority to increase McGowan ’s sentence to life in prison .
In the end , however , she gave him seven years for his role in the arsons , partly because McGowan helped to persuade his co-conspirators to plead guilty .

BBC News , Beijing
Hu Jia was arrested in his dining room , two days after Christmas
His wife , fellow activist Zeng Jinyan , is now under house arrest .
At least 10 security personnel guard her home .
Mr Hu's arrest comes as China celebrates the start of one of its most important years in recent history .
This summer , all eyes will be on it as it plays host to the Olympic Games .
Foreign campaigners say Beijing has not fulfilled its promise to improve human rights ahead of the Olympics - a charge the Chinese government flatly denies .
But the country 's human rights record - including Mr Hu's case - will be under scrutiny as much as its sporting endeavours .
' Inciting subversion '
Mr Hu was arrested two days after Christmas , during the afternoon , as he sat at his computer in the dining room of his home .
When officers barged into his flat , his wife was in the bedroom , feeding their two - and - a - half - month - old baby .
According to his arrest warrant , issued by the Beijing Public Security Bureau , the 34 - year - old is accused of inciting subversion .
We 've said very clearly that we want full respect of human rights
Olympic chief Jacques Rogge , 2004
Mr Hu is a well - known HIV / Aids activist who also helps publicise other human rights cases in China .
He has been arrested several times before .
On the night he was taken away , six police officers stayed at Mr Hu's home to guard his wife , her mother and their child .
Telephone lines and internet access to the home , in an eastern Beijing suburb , have been cut off .
When the BBC visited the couple 's flat , we found Ms Zeng was being closely guarded by at least 10 public security officers .
We arrived as three of them were escorting her as she walked her baby in a shared garden next to her apartment .
Zeng Jinyan and her family are guarded by at least 10 people
Four of them then pushed the 24 - year - old back towards her apartment .
" I try to be strong because I need to feed my baby , but during the first three days after my husband 's arrest I lost 2kg , " she said as she was forced away .
Still clutching her baby , she added : " I do n't know where my husband is , because I have no contact with the outside world . "
The officer in charge at the scene refused to say why Ms Zeng could not leave her home or why she could not be formally interviewed .
Redefining human rights
When China made its bid to stage this year 's Olympic Games , it said the event would lead to improvements in the country 's human rights situation .
The International Olympic Committee , which awarded Beijing the games , said it would keep a close eye on that record in the run-up to the event .
" We 've said very clearly that we want full respect of human rights , " Olympic chief Jacques Rogge told the BBC in 2004 .
The democracy and human rights of the people will be vigorously enhanced and safeguarded
Liu Jingmin , Beijing Olympic organising committee
Some even claim the Chinese government is cracking down harder on dissenters as the Olympics approach , to prevent embarrassing demonstrations .
" As China prepares to welcome the world in 2008 , it has to demonstrate that it respects human rights and the rule of law , " said Sharon Hom , executive director of Human Rights in China , in response to Mr Hu's detention .
" Otherwise the promises made by the Chinese government to its people and the world will become increasingly meaningless . "
Beijing sidesteps complaints about human rights abuses in China partly by redefining the term .
It claims human rights have more to do with providing people with food , clothing and shelter than with freedom of speech .
Liu Jingmin , executive vice - president of the Beijing Olympics organising committee , claimed in October that the games were promoting human rights in China .
" The Olympic preparatory work is progressing concurrently with China 's development , " he said .
" In the process , the democracy and human rights of the people will be vigorously enhanced and safeguarded . "
If he could be contacted for a comment , Hu Jia would probably disagree .
World economy heading for ' perfect storm '
One of the world 's leading financial experts has warned that a ' perfect storm ' could be about to hit Western economies .
Dire warning : IMF's Simon Johnson
There is rising concern that the US economy will slip into recession next year dragging many economies - including Britain - down with it as the global credit crisis worsens .
The Washington - based International Monetary Fund has warned of a ' perfect storm ' caused by surging oil prices and the turbulence on financial markets .
Its chief economist , Simon Johnson , said yesterday : ' The combination of the credit crunch and high oil prices could bring a big reduction in international trade from which no one would be immune . '
Mr Johnson cautioned that the current projections for the American economy and those of Europe are ' too optimistic ' and would have to be downgraded .
Only last month , in its World Economic Outlook report , the IMF suggested that the US and the West would weather the storms on markets , but lowered its growth forecast for the American economy to 1.9 % this year and next from 2.9 % in 2006 .
The Federal Reserve , the US central bank , joined in the gloom .
Its analysis from the American regions said ' mortgage delinquencies are up significantly in many areas ' and ' home building is not expected to recover until next year ' .
Britain 's largest bank said it is ' nervous about how the housing bubble will unwind ' .
HSBC believes the Bank of England may have to lower interest rates far more aggressively than has been expected if Britain is to avoid a house prices crash .
HSBC says it expects the Bank to lower interest rates by 1.25 percentage points to 4.5 % by early 2009 as it seeks to repair the damage to the economy caused by the end of the house price boom and slowing output .
It also expects the pound to plummet against the American dollar , dropping back to $ 1.80 from last night 's price of $ 2.07 .
The Bank has warned that credit conditions are tightening , so cash for lending to consumers , housing and industry will shrink .
Evidence of the slowdown on the High Street came from DSG International , which owns Currys and PC World .
It warned that sales of items such as refrigerators and washing machines have slowed and is cautious about prospects for next year .
But there was some relief from oil markets yesterday .
The price tumbled four per cent to $ 90 a barrel - earlier this week it was near $ 100 a barrel - after the US government said stockpiles in America are far larger than expected .
Economic analysis , house price news and much more ...
Forty years ago , I entered the Gaza Strip — soon after Israel had conquered that teeming caldron of humanity after defeating Egypt in the Six - Day War — to report on the Israelis ’ bubbling optimism about their young nation ’s future .
“ Come back in 10 years and you wo n’t recognize the place , ” an Israeli general told me , spelling out visions of economic development and a grateful Arab population .
Similar predictions were made for the West Bank , which had been administered by Jordan in a somewhat more humane yet still quite oppressive manner .
The optimism of the Israeli occupiers did not seem so far - fetched then , given the hardships the Palestinians had endured under their fellow Arab protectors and throughout the diaspora .
The experience of the Palestinians was not unlike that of the Jews :
They were needed but scorned for their talents .
Both refugee groups were scarred by grinding oppression and each nurtured a thirst for nationhood fortified by a tribally based religiosity that secular leaders often found useful .
That is the story of Hamas , a creation of the Egyptian - based Muslim Brotherhood , a religious and political organization that flourished after Israel humbled Gamal Abdel Nasser , the last great Arab nationalist leader , with its devastating victory over Egypt .
The Palestinian movement was then led by puppets of Nasser and was secular in focus .
It remained so , after being invigorated by the late Yasser Arafat , who gave the Palestinians their first serious and independent political identification .
But as Arafat wasted his credibility in futile jockeying with Israel ( mostly while in exile ) , corruption came to dominate his movement .
By contrast , the religious zealots who later formed the Hamas organization were more focused on spiritual probity and tended far more closely to the needs of their impoverished brethren in Gaza and the West Bank .
As with Hezbollah in Lebanon — and that other Iranian - backed Islamist movement , the Shiites who now control Iraq — the religious movements , both Shiite - and Sunni - based , cornered the market on purity of purpose as opposed to rank opportunism .
That is precisely why these fiercely anti-Western movements have been able to turn the favorite fig leaf of U.S. neocolonialism , the slogans of democracy and elections , against the United States by winning popular elections .
While the American mass media tend to join the Bush administration in ignoring this unpleasant contradiction , the fact is that the people we brand as the enemy can make a strong claim to having won the election that our President Bush champions .
What irony that the United States and the European Union , both of which cut off aid to the Palestinian government in 2006 when Hamas won the election , have now resumed aid to the PLO - dominated government that lost power through the vote .
This contradiction applies even more uncomfortably to Israel , which consistently demeaned the Palestinian movement when it was run by secularists .
Israel only very reluctantly , and in the most limited of ways , was willing to risk the false security of occupied land for the possibility of peace .
Israeli leaders of all parties drew the line at granting the Palestinians a real state with contiguous land and a significant presence in Jerusalem as it existed before the Six - Day War .
Rarely mentioned is that some elements in the Israeli government initially supported the rise of Hamas as a desired alternative to the PLO and came too late to the recognition that Arafat , for all of his very serious failings , was their best alternative .
Now it is also too late for the remnants of the PLO to once again unilaterally assert a claim to lead the Palestinians .
Sure , the United States , Israel and the EU can throw aid and tax dollars their way , but if the price is that the PLO assist in crushing Hamas , or even sit idly by while Israeli troops reoccupy Gaza , there will be chaos .
The only hope is for the funders , including Israel ( which has withheld the tax monies paid by the Palestinians from them ) , to recognize that the Palestinian people need to make their own history .
At this point , that must include Hamas , which it is hoped will be moved , as was the PLO , to accept Israel ’s right to exist within borders that permit a viable Palestinian state .
That lesson of empowerment must also be applied throughout the region , from Lebanon to Iraq and Iran , where election results subvert the ambitions of the foreigners .
Elections are great if they give the conquerors the results they want , but it is in the nature of things that people will not use the ballot to legitimize their oppression for long .
The democracy project , ballyhooed by President Bush , founders on its failure to allow the will of the voters to be heard when they dare vote against U.S. policy .
Physicists at the University of Alberta , in Edmonton , Alberta , Canada , have made a major advance in the understanding of what appears to be a new state of matter .
Working in the highly specialized field of quantum fluids and solids , Prof. John Beamish , chair of the Department of Physics , and PhD student James Day , report their findings in a paper to be published in the science journal Nature on Wednesday , Dec. 6 , 2007 .
Beamish and Day are the only researchers in Canada conducting experimental research in this area of fundamental physics .
At very low temperatures , helium gas turns into a liquid .
Put under extreme pressure the liquid turns into a solid .
Physicists have been manipulating solid helium so they can study its unusual behaviour .
In 2004 , a research team at Penn State university in the United States , led by Dr. Moses Chan , electrified the physics world when it announced that it may have discovered an entirely new state of matter – supersolidity .
The team made the discovery by cooling solid helium to an extremely low temperature and oscillating the material at different speeds .
They found that the particles behaved in a way not seen before , which suggested it might show the “ perpetual flow ” seen in superfluids like liquid helium .
Day and Dr. Beamish have taken this research a different direction .
In an experiment not done before , they cooled the solid helium and manipulated the material another way – by shearing it elastically .
In doing so , they found that the solid behaved in an entirely new and unexpected way – it became much stiffer at the lowest temperatures .
“ The experimental results from the University of Alberta are remarkable , ” Dr. Chan said .
“ Namely , Professor Beamish and his student James Day found that the shear modulus of solid helium increases by 20 % when it is cooled below 0.25 K .
“ Furthermore , the temperature dependence of the shear modulus seems to track the period change seen in torsional oscillator .
It seems the two phenomena are related and probably have the same mechanical origin .
“ This is an important breakthrough since the original discovery , ” Chan said .
Other physicists around the world are also studying the implications .
Through this discovery , Beamish and Day have significantly added to the body of knowledge about the fundamental states of matter allowed by nature .

Introduction
Every now and again , a product comes out that defies easy categorization .
The ASUS Eee PC is such a product .
Is it a small laptop for children ?
Is it something that your grandma might like , or perhaps just a tchotchke that an enthusiast would enjoy as a secondary portable computer ?
ASUS seems to think that it's all of these things and more , and they 're probably right .
It 's also less than the sum of its parts at times , for those that prefer to be a bit more pessimistic .
At its core , the Eee PC is simply a new take on old hardware .
Flash back to the state - of - the - art in computer performance , around the time of the dreaded attack of the Y2 K bug .
Back then , a high - end desktop computer might come equipped with a Pentium III 800MHz chip ( or Athlon 650 ) , 512MB of RAM , a GeForce DDR graphics card , and a 15 GB hard drive .
Throw in the rest of the accessories , and you 're talking about a computer that would have cost somewhere approximately $ 1500 for a midrange setup , and as much as $ 3,000 ( or more ) if you purchased bleeding - edge components .
Now squish all of that into a 7 " ultraportable laptop chassis , cut the hard drive size down to 4GB , and sell it for $ 400 .
You also get wireless networking and a webcam , or you can ditch the webcam and save yourself $ 50 .
Almost eight years later , that 's more or less what ASUS has done .
Depending on your perspective , that sounds like either a great new product or a complete waste of time .
There really is no easy way to say which opinion is correct , and not surprisingly user reviews popping up around the Internet show both sides of the coin .
The " Eee " in Eee PC is an acronym of sorts , because computer people love those .
" Easy to Learn , Easy to Work , Easy to Play " ; " Excellent Internet Experience " ; " Excellent On - the - Go " .
Look at the ASUS Eee webpages , and you will find a preponderance of the use of words starting with " E " used to describe the Eee PC .
One acronym you wo n't see used is UMPC , but while the Eee PC is certainly different from your typical UMPC - it lacks the touch sensitive stylus interface and it runs Linux by default - it can certainly fulfill the same niche if necessary , with some caveats .
Considering it costs half as much as the cheapest UMPCs , anyone looking for such a device should give the Eee PC some consideration .
What about grandma and grandpa who need an easy to use computer for Internet and email access , or little Billy who 's in elementary school ?
Despite the low price , the Eee PC might not be the right choice for that sort of person .
Grandma and grandpa will probably scream in pain as they try to type on the tiny keyboard with their arthritic fingers while squinting at the screen , and Billy is going to wonder why there are n't more games or other " cool stuff " .
That 's not to say that these people can't use the Eee PC , but there are other options out there that might be a better fit .
Trying to put together a review of the Eee PC is actually quite difficult , so instead of our usual gauntlet of benchmark results , we 're going to be giving more of a touchy - feely overview of what it 's like to use the Eee PC .
There are plenty of things to like , but we also encountered a fair share of irritation .
If you tried to sell us on the idea of using the Eee PC as our only computer , we would balk and walk away quickly .
As a secondary or tertiary computing device , however , it has a lot more potential .
Join us as we run applications , write letters , surf the web , and dismantle the Eee PC .
Nov. 24 , 2007 Special to ABCNEWS.com  --
In the past few years , there 's been a big push by major college football teams to increase revenue through massive stadium expansions , lucrative premium seating and rich sponsorship and broadcast deals -- the same blueprint the National Football League used for decades to create billion - dollar franchises .
The game plan is working in college , albeit on a much smaller scale :
Last year , 10 college football teams raked in at least $ 45 million in revenues -- among them , the University of Notre Dame , University of Georgia , Ohio State and Auburn University - - compared to none five years ago .
Of course , college teams are n't sold in the open market like NFL teams .
But the revenue they generate is extremely valuable .
Our second annual ranking of the most valuable teams in college football is based on what the football programs contribute to four important beneficiaries : their university ( the value of contributions from football to the institution for academic purposes , including scholarship payments for football players ) ; athletic department ( the net profit generated by the football program ultimately retained by the department ) ; conference ( the distribution of bowl game revenue ) ; and local communities with a vested interest in the team ( incremental spending in the county during home - game weekends ) .
Our system weighs those four elements in declining order .
This year 's rankings were expanded from 15 to 20 teams .
Click here to see America 's most valueable college football franchises at our partner site , Forbes.com .
The University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish , worth $ 101 million , is the most valuable team in college football .
Unlike the other programs on our list , Notre Dame 's athletic department operates under the umbrella of the university and is not run as its own distinct entity .
As a result , a much higher share of profits are retained by university for academic use .
The football team 's contribution to academics totaled $ 21.1 million for the 2006 - 2007 season -- that 's as much as the next five most valuable teams contributed to their respective schools combined .
Operating independent of the conference system allows Notre Dame to keep the entire $ 9 million in annual television revenue it gets from NBC , owned by General Electric .
The University of Texas Longhorns , worth $ 92 million , was football 's most profitable team last season , earning $ 46.2 million , of which $ 4.7 million went to academics .
When the Longhorns play at home , Travis County sees an estimated $ 9.4 million of incremental spending associated with the game , a virtual tie with St. Joseph County during Notre Dame home games .
University of Texas merchandise royalties doubled to $ 8 million after the Longhorns won the national championship in 2006 .
Premium and club seating at Darrell K. Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium generates $ 12 million a year .
The athletic department even added an exclusive space , dubbed the Centennial Room , which is reserved for boosters who contribute the most money to the program .
In fact , 16 of the 20 most valuable teams have undergone major stadium expansions and renovations over the past 10 years , and three others have renovation plans in the works .
Premium seating has proved to be a valuable revenue stream that was non-existent at the time most aging college stadiums were constructed .
Ohio State ( Ohio Stadium ) and the University of Tennessee ( Neyland Stadium ) , for example , added 81 and 78 suites , respectively , in recent years .
Both stadiums opened in the 1920s , predating even the forward pass .
For programs like the University of Michigan , with a stadium capacity of 107,501 , the largest in the country , luxury suites are a much more feasible way to increase stadium revenue than building another crowded upper deck .
The 31 largest college stadiums , on average , already have 11,000 more seats than a typical NFL stadium .
One of the strongest links tying the college and professional football in recent years has been corporate sponsorships .
Both PepsiCo's Gatorade brand and apparel maker Under Armour use images of college and professional football side - by - side in commercials , leaving some to wonder whether Steve Spurrier 's day job is to be the head coach of South Carolina or team click - clack .
Gatorade sponsors five of the six major college athletic conferences , as well as the NFL , while sister company Pepsi Bottling Group is in its third year of a 10 - year , $ 27 million deal with the University of Florida .
College programs have taken other pages from the NFL 's playbook , but not without adding their own touch .
Take seat licensing and naming rights .
The University of Tennessee raised $ 16 million of the $ 21.2 million contributed to the Volunteer Athletic & Scholarship Fund in the last fiscal year through reservation fees for football tickets .
While college stadiums have historically been named after the team , school or home state , companies are now taking a prominent role .
Look no further than the Papa John 's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville , named after the eponymous pizza company following a contribution by its founder .
And there 's the University of Minnesota 's future home , TCF Bank Stadium .
New television arrangements will only further drive up college football team values in the future .
Following the NFL's lead , the Big Ten Conference launched its own network this summer , the first cable outlet to reach 30 million homes in its first 30 days on air , despite charging carriers as much as $ 1 per subscriber .
Big 12 Conference institutions will see a $ 16 million boast in TV revenue next year from existing deals with Fox Sports Net , owned by News Corp. , and ESPN / ABC , owned by Walt Disney Co. , with some schools projected to make as much as $ 10 million in 2008 , based on their number of TV appearances and scheduling .

Lev Navrozov Archive
The insanity of genius : Would Einstein be turned away by today 's intelligentsia ?
Lev Navrozov emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1972
He settled in New York City where he quickly learned that there was no market for his eloquent and powerful English language attacks on the Soviet Union .
To this day , he writes without fear or favor or the conventions of polite society .
He chaired the " Alternative to the New York Times Committee " in 1980 , challenged the editors of the New York Times to a debate ( which they declined ) and became a columnist for the New York City Tribune .
His columns are today read in both English and Russian .
Even as children in Stalin ’s Russia we knew about Edison what was known in his native USA .
At 12 , he became a railroad newsboy and at 15 a telegraph operator .
As of 1928 , that is , three years before his death ( in 1931 , at the age of 84 ) , he had taken out 1,033 patents for his inventions , creating today ’s environment in a “ modern country . ”
During WWI he worked on naval technology for the government .
Yet his genius did not make the US military might as superior to that of the Imperial Germany as his incandescent electric lamp was superior to its kerosene or oil predecessor .
While Edison was accepted in Soviet Russia , Einstein was not even mentioned in our school textbooks of physics .
In 1914 , at the age of 35 , Einstein , a Jew who did not conceal his pro-Jewish sentiments , left Switzerland for Germany , adopted German citizenship , and became — the Director (! ) of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physics Institute in Berlin !
Also In This Edition The German word “ Kaiser ” means “ Emperor , ” and Germany was an empire .
Emperor Wilhelm II waged a war for four years against Britain , France , the USA , and Russia — and lost it .
Whereupon his former opponents began to accuse him of the aggression in 1914 and made Germany defenseless against Soviet Russia .
Yet Einstein never thought of emigrating from Germany , until 1933 , that is , twenty years later , after he had learned , while in the United States as a visitor , that Nazis had pillaged the home of the Einsteins in Germany .
Why this devotion of his to the German Empire of Wilhelm II ?
Emperors patronized elitist culture , whether in art or in science , accessible only to the few .
Even today , in its “ Biography of Albert Einstein , ” Yahoo ! says :
At the time of the publication on the theory of relativity , the people that read the papers [ by Einstein ] met them with skepticism and ridicule .
As the other papers were published , they were viewed the same way .
Let us recall that Einstein received in 1905 his Ph.D. in order to get a “ university position ” and thus make a living , but got none and had to work as a clerk in a patent office in Berne , Switzerland .
Universities are “ collectives ” ( the noun originated in English in 1655 ) .
Every member depends on his colleagues for recognition , appreciation , promotion .
Now , members of imperial institutions of culture did not depend on their colleagues .
Today ’s composers , performers , arrangers , etc. , in the West must please as many listeners as possible .
Hence “ mass culture ” and in particular , “ pop music . ”
Great composers of the past wrote “ classical music , ” in which only the musical elite was ( and is ) interested .
But those composers did not depend financially on mass audiences .
Wilhelm II decided ( correctly ) that Einstein was not understood by many physicists because he was too great and hence sounded ridiculous if not insane to learned mediocrities .
The other day I saw a television program on the origin of the Earth .
Flushed all over the screen was the photograph of Einstein .
But what is amazing about Einstein that the program did not mention ?
He said that there is no single time for the universe , but each point of it has its own space - time .
The producers of the U.S. television program I saw did not say ( in 2007 ! ) a word about such thoughts of Einstein in 1905 or 1912 .
Possibly they found those thoughts insane or did not want their audience to suppose that they ( the producers ) were insane .
Einstein would not have been able to exist in a US university in 1914 , for he would be ousted from it by learned mediocrities who fill any university collective as its majority .
But as the Director of an Imperial institution , Einstein throve , and in 1921 , he received a Nobel Prize .
Not for his “ insane discoveries , ” but the prize helped him to thrive and publish his insane thoughts in Germany before Hitler came to power , and the “ Aryan ” physicists declared his physics to be a Jewish degeneracy .
The irony is that Germany had been nurturing Einstein since 1914 , and in 1933 chased him out as a Jew , along with other Jewish physicists , into the United States where in 1939 he wrote ( at the request of Jewish émigrés ) his famous letter of Aug. 2 to President Roosevelt about the possibility of development of nuclear weapons ahead of Nazi Germany , that is , ensuring its defeat .
In 1986 , the Chinese dictatorship created ( like the Emperor ! )
Project 863 to consider what a “ normal ” research institution would find ridiculous or insane .
The dictatorship of China has been trying to net in this way an Einstein and other minds of genius , in the post - nuclear fields , for in the last analysis , superior military might depends on minds of genius , and not on 10,000 “ normal ” universities , considering these minds of genius ridiculous or insane .
In 1986 , a born and bred American named Eric Drexler published a book , subtitled “ Coming Era of Nanotechnology , ” and founded “ The Foresight Institute . ”
No one can deny that it was Drexler who coined the very word “ nanotechnology ” and that the era of nanotechnology has come .
But Drexler ’s theory has been proclaimed ( by American savants , not by Project 863 in China ! ) ridiculous or insane .

I wrote an article for Wired about the return of the geekiest TV show ever .
I did n't have room to include some game - related stuff , so I 'm posting it this week on Game | Life .
Who could axe for a better Xmas gift ?
This first post is about the single most gamer - friendly episode of Futurama .
THE SCENE : It 's the 31st century , and Earth is being bombarded by invaders ... possibly from space .
They attack in formation , moving from left to right , then dropping down , changing directions and speeding up .
" Tremble in fear at our three different kinds of ships ! " says the evil alien Lrrr of planet Nintendu 64 .
Their movements look somewhat familiar to Philip J. Fry , an interloper from the 20th century .
The fate of the Earth now rests on his ability to summon up the skills he honed during his misspent childhood .
Can he blast these dastardly space invaders out of the sky ?
Fry tries to get back into his old arcade gamer mindset .
" All right , " he says .
" It 's Saturday night .
I have no date , a two - liter bottle of Shasta and my all - Rush mix tape .
Let 's rock ! "
That 's how the climactic sequence from the Futurama segment “ Raiders of the Lost Arcade ” begins .
It has become a gamer touchstone , just as the Futurama episode " Where No Fan Has Gone Before " has become a Trekkie touchstone .
The people who made this animated scifi comedy are masters of nerd fan service .
“ Raiders of the Lost Arcade ” is a nonstop barrage of game references .
There are gags about warp pipes , free lives , and allusions to Battle
Zone , Missile Command and Pac - Man .
But the climactic battle is the showstopper .
At first , Fry 's attempts to thwart the space invaders seem successful .
“ I 've still got a trick or two up my sleeve , " he brags as Rush 's track Tom Sawyer plays in the background .
" Watch as I fire upwards through our own shield ! ”
His showboating terrifies his friends .
The robot Bender screams , " He 's a madman !
A madman ! "
Fry is ultimately unable to kill the last alien .
Game Over .
The commander of the space invaders emerges from his ship and taunts his human adversary .
“ Instead of shooting where I was , you should have shot at where I was going to be ! ” he says .
The evil alien is joined by his evil arcade comrades : Donkey Kong , a fried egg from Burger Time , a robot from * Berserk* , a brain from Robotron .
Q*bert is also there , and he spouts some characteristically garbled dialogue which , when played backwards , is revealed to be “ Where can a guy get some pants around here ? ”
Did you get that ?
Geeks who actually went to the trouble of playing the audio snippet backwards found an extra joke .
The willingness of Futurama writers to go to so much trouble to squeeze in one more gag is typical of the show .
That 's why Futurama in general and the " Raiders of the Lost Arcade " segment in particular are so beloved , and it's a big part of the reason that the show is back in production .
Only a tiny fragment of the audience –the Dennis Miller ratio–may get the joke .
But whoever does becomes a fan for life .
" I wrote ' Raiders of the Lost Arcade ' , " says David X. Cohen , co-creator and showrunner of Futurama .
" The origin of that idea was a whole movie about aliens invading earth in the exact pattern of Space Invaders .
I had high hopes , but the feature idea got chopped down to five minutes . "
Cohen is a gamer geek who studied theoretical computer science at
Cal Berkeley before going into comedy writing .
He and many of the other writers on the show are familiar with games and the underlying programming languages used to make them , and they slipped in little references that only a fellow gamer would get .
You can listen to Cohen and the other writers discuss their fave games on the commentary track to this episode , which is on the Futurama Season 3 box set .

A rare visit : The PLO 's ambassador to Poland visited the Auschwitz - Birkenau concentration camp on Wednesday .
Khaled Soufan was accompanied by David Peleg , the Israeli ambassador to Poland .
The two spent some two and a half hours in the camp , during which Soufan told Peleg that only when one visits Auschwitz , can one grasp the scope of the Holocaust .
Soufan , a former PLO ambassador to Hungary , befriended the Israeli ambassador in Budapest and expressed his interest in visiting the concentration camp .
Soufan seemed impressed by the number of the Jewish youth groups visiting the camp , and was moved by the memorial ceremony held by the Birkenau monument .
After signing the camp 's visitors ' journal , Soufan told reporters he was there to convey his solidarity with the Jewish people 's suffering during World War II .
The PLO ambassador is not the only unlikely visitor to the camp :
The Pakistani ambassador to Poland visited Auschwitz earlier in October and several of the Pakistani military officials are scheduled to visit it in the next few weeks .

Obviously , it is difficult to create procedures than can withstand attempts at manipulation .
If the demand of the people is strong enough , ingenious methods can be implemented which discourage manipulation .
Moreover , new technologies and new insights into biology , psychology , and related fields will lead to new forms of psychological warfare and manipulation by the elite .
That is why a " vigilant " public is the strongest protection because -- when the public is paying attention -- the elites know they have to behave themselves .
That is why informing and waking up the population is the key to protecting freedom in the long - term .
On Monday , Senator Chris Dodd simply and forcefully showed what one principled man can do in America .
Just when the rest of the Democratic Party was on the verge of the one billionth collapse to George W. Bush in a row , Dodd stepped in to stop the cave - in .
The issue at hand was giving retroactive immunity to the telecommunication companies for breaking the FISA law .
First of all , think about that , why would you need immunity if you have n't broken the law ?
And if you broke the law , why should Congress let you get away with it ?
But of course , they were going to .
Senate Majority Leader , Harry Reid planned to bring up the version of the new FISA bill that the Republicans supported .
He favored the approach supported by Dick Cheney rather than the other version put together by Democratic Senator Pat Leahy .
Why he did that is an open question , to say the least .
And , of course , our so - called Democratic leaders who are running for president , with the obvious exception of Sen .
Dodd , were missing in action .
I thought Fox News might devote their whole coverage to Senator Clinton today since she was a missing blond .
Meanwhile , Senator Obama made his bid for the Profiles in Courage Hall of Fame by issuing a press release saying since he did n't have to be there for the fight ( because they would only counting votes against Dodd and he would be voting with Dodd ) , he would n't .
In essence , he was saying -- since I do n't have to be there , I wo n't .
Inspiring !
But despite the fact that his Majority Leader sided with the Bush administration and none of the Democratic leading candidates for president showed up , Senator Dodd pressed on anyway .
Because , maybe just one person could make a difference .
The first vote was 76 - 10 against Senator Dodd .
It did n't look good .
Trying to get forty Democrats to stand up to President Bush is a Herculean task .
They 're using to giving up without a fight .
In fact , in his first speech of the morning Senator Dodd mentioned that the Democrats had said over and over that they would fight the next time against the next Bush administration abuse , but never did .
And he said the time had come to draw the line .
He said why not here , why not now ?
Then when he began the fight a curious thing happened .
It turned out the Republicans and the Bush folks were n't as mean and tough as advertised .
The filibuster could have lasted 108 hours in all to get through all the cloture motions and the Senate would have gotten nothing done the week before Christmas break .
They could n't countenance that , so voila , victory !
Just that simple .
Harry Reid came out and said they were going to table immunity for the telecoms and consider it after the break .
The bill did n't pass and Bush and the people who helped him break the law were not given retroactive immunity for the crimes they might have committed .
Good guys win , bad guys lose .
All it took was one Senator and an afternoon .
And we stopped them cold in their tracks .
Now , that was n't so hard , was it ?
Now , imagine if the Democrats all united to fight the Bush administration together .
Then , they just might be able to beat the most unpopular president of all time every once in awhile .
Will other Democrats learn anything from this ?
Will they get the message that it does n't take that much to fight these guys and that just one person can make a difference , let alone all of them fighting together ?
I hope so .
I 'd like to ask Senator Clinton if she got the message , but I could n't find her .

Pakistan roiled by flour and electricity shortages , food price rises
By Vilani Peiris and Keith Jones
21 January 2008
Pakistan ’s US - backed military dictatorship has mobilized more than six thousand paramilitary troops to guard flour mills and distribution points and escort supply - trucks , as it seeks to staunch a flour shortage that has resulted in breadlines and spiraling prices .
Rangers and Frontier Constabulary were ordered into action by the newly created Federal Food Committee ( FCC ) on Sunday , January 13 .
In the preceding days there had been long lines of angry people outside government food distribution centers who had to be turned away empty - handed and several instances of anti-government protests .
State - subsidized flour , when available , sells for between and 14 and 18 Pakistani rupees per kilogram , but the price on the open market more than doubled at the beginning of January , reaching 60 rupees in some areas .
Roughly the equivalent of $ US1 , 60 rupees is the average wage of a day laborer in Pakistan .
Three - quarters of Pakistan ’s 160 million people live on less than $ 2 per day .
The price spike has aggravated the suffering of millions whose daily incomes have already been taxed by rising food prices .
Food prices have risen by more than 10 percent in each of the last three years , including a 14 percent hike in 2007 .
The government has blamed the flour shortage on the riots that erupted across the country in response to the December 27 assassination of Pakistan People ’s Party ( PPP ) leader and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
The government and the Bush administration have rushed to pin Bhutto ’s murder on Islamic extremists , conveniently ignoring the Pakistani military ’s longstanding sponsorship of , and intimate ties to , various Islamicist militias , including the Taliban , and its decades - long hostility toward the PPP .
The majority of Pakistanis , however , believe that sections of the military - intelligence apparatus and / or their allies were the real authors Bhutto ’s death .
A Gallup Pakistan poll , based on interviews with 1300 people and released last week , found that 23 percent of Pakistanis believe the military and its agencies were behind Bhutto ’s assassination , 25 percent suspect political allies of the government , and 12 percent blame the US .
Just 17 percent of those polled believe the Taliban or al - Qaeda were responsible .
The government claims that massive amounts of grain and flour were stolen during the riots , especially in Bhutto ’s native province of Sind .
Opposition politicians charge that the government estimate is grossly inflated .
At the very most , the anti-government riots brought to a head a developing crisis .
Early in 2007 the government took the decision to allow the export of half a million tons of wheat , but subsequently Pakistan found itself short of grain and to make up the shortfall imported wheat from Russia and Australia at a 70 percent higher price .
Says PPP spokesman Farhatullah Khan Barbar , “ Either the claims of a bumper crop [ made in early 2007 ] were false and designed to justify wheat exports when exports should not have been permitted or , if the claims were correct , the wheat stock has been hoarded somewhere and the current crisis is artificial . ”
Significant amounts of wheat and flour have reportedly been smuggled from Pakistan into Afghanistan and India , where they have been able to command higher prices .
In 2004 , in keeping with its neo-liberal economic agenda , the government relaxed controls on the shipment of wheat across provincial boundaries — controls that had been introduced to thwart hoarding and price manipulation .
Speaking to the press at the beginning of last week , the FCC ’s chairman , retired Lieutenant - General Farooq Ahmed Khan , said his concern was increasing supplies , not ferreting out hoarders : “ I am not responsible for who did what in the past .
I am here to improve the situation through supplies and bring down prices . ”
In retaliation for an FCC - directed campaign to stop flour and wheat from entering Afghanistan , Afghanistan closed its border - crossing with Pakistan at Chaman on January 15 and only reopened it the next day .
The US - installed government in Kabul has denied it ordered the shutdown , which held up oil shipments bound for NATO forces in Afghanistan .
It says the closure was imposed on border officials by local warlords and smugglers .
The flour crisis is also bound up with an even larger problem — Pakistan ’s chronic power shortage .
A major reason for the lack of flour was that flour mills had been forced to curtail their operations due to power - cuts .
Acting on FCC orders , the Ministry of Water and Power announced in the middle of last week that it had taken steps so as to ensure that 90 percent of the country ’s flour mills were receiving at least 19 hours of electricity per day .
But large sections of the economy continue to be crippled by the power crisis .
Pakistan ’s power system has long been plagued by cuts and brownouts .
The government claimed that privatization would attract new investment , but the sell - off of the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation has resulted in higher prices and continuing , if not worsening , power cuts .
In an attempt to balance power generation and demand , the Water and Power Development Authority announced a four - hour daily cut in service in December .
This was doubled to eight hours after the late December riots disrupted the distribution of oil and natural gas .
In early January , the government ordered all the country ’s steel smelting units and many steel re-rolling units shut down for two weeks , leading the steelmakers to put thousands of workers on temporary layoffs .
Textile mills have also been instructed to close operations for five hours in the evening to conserve power .
According to an article in yesterday ’s Dawn , thousands of workers in Sailkot ’s surgical instruments manufacturing industry have been laid off because of the combined impact of the electricity cuts and problems in the supply of natural gas from Baluchistan .
In mid-December , the same newspaper reported that more than a hundred textile mills had closed down for want of gas .
The Musharraf regime has repeatedly been lauded by the Bush administration and such mouthpieces of international capital as the Economist magazine for its right - wing economic program of deregulation , privatization , and anti-workers laws .
Over the past five years Pakistan ’s economy has grown at an annual rate of more than 7 percent , as foreign and expatriate Pakistani capital have sought to exploit new profit - making opportunities and Pakistan ’s abundant cheap labor and as the officers corps has gorged on a steady stream of US aid money .
But Pakistan ’s economy faces mounting problems due to its massive dependence on oil imports , dilapidated physical infrastructure , and lack of investment in education and health care .
Moreover , the expansion of recent years has been associated with increased social inequality , in a country already marked by great extremes of wealth and poverty , and increased economic insecurity .
The IMF recently warned that Pakistan ’s economic growth will slow in 2008 and expressed concerns about the country ’s burgeoning current accounts and trade deficits .
During the first half of the current financial year , which began last July 1 , Pakistan recorded a trade deficit of $ 8.24 billion .
There have been repeated warnings from the government that unpopular measures , including hiking gasoline and kerosene prices to international levels , will be required in the coming year .
The State Bank has warned of “ renewed macroeconomic complications ... if prompt action is not taken to correct the drift in fiscal indicators . ”
But the government is trying to delay the oil price increases and other dramatic measures , for fear they will further unbalance the regime .
In a foretaste of what is to come , Islamabad signaled earlier this month that it is cutting the country ’s development budget by 15 percent , or 80 billion rupees .
The PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League ( Nawaz ) , the principal opposition parties , are acutely aware of Pakistan ’s mounting economic problems and especially of the profound popular anger over price rises , unemployment and the lack of public services .
This has only made the bourgeois opposition , its leaders ’ bombast notwithstanding , all the more determined to prevent any mass popular agitation against the Musharraf regime .
They fear that a mass challenge to the dictatorship could escape their control and give rise to a movement that couples demands for the scrapping of military rule and the breaking of Pakistan ’s subservient military alliance with Washington with calls for radical socio-economic measures to provide jobs and a decent income for all .
Instead Sharif , himself the scion of a prominent family of industrialists and a former political protégé of the military , and Bhutto ’s dynastic successor , her husband Asaf Ali Zardari , continue to appeal to Washington and London for support — no matter that the Bush administration and its British allies have demonstrated time and again that they are determined to see a military - dominated government in the saddle in Islamabad , the better to pursue their predatory interests in the region .
In previous posts ( here for the Dojo 0.4.3 version , here and here ) , I wrote how I wrote an image gallery for version 0.4.3 of the Dojo Ajax Toolkit , and how I was translating it for the latest version of the toolkit , version 1.0 .
Well , that work is now , finally , complete , and I have to say , I ’m pretty damn happy with the results .
The code is now part of the dojox.image project ( dojox is the Dojo extensions project , for cool new code that may in the future make it into the core code base if enough people like / want it ) .
If you ’d like to just see the gallery in action , have a look at the Photos page on my personal website , or see the links at the bottom of the post , otherwise , read on !
Update : changes have been made to the widgets since this post was written , resulting in some badly aligned images .
This will be fixed in the next few days .
( Oct 25th 2007 )
Update : issue above has been fixed ( Oct 29th 2007 )
All For One… .
The gallery is composed of three widgets :
dojox.image .
ThumbnailPicker – a widget to list many small images in either a horizontal or vertical orientation , scroll through them , and attach click events that other widgets can listen to
dojox.image .SlideShow – a widget that displays one image at a time , and can run a slideshow , changing the images every ‘ x ’ seconds .
dojox.image .
Gallery – A wrapper around the ThumbnailPicker , and SlideShow widgets .
Both the ThumbnailPicker and Slideshow widgets can also be used on their own , and have no dependencies on each other .
Dojo Data Is Too Cool for School
One of the coolest features of all of these widgets is that they all feed off image data provided by the dojo.data API .
What this basically means is that each widget can display images from any source , with no modification whatsoever .
You simply pass it a Dojo data store , and is shows the pictures .
Some of the data stores currently in the Dojo toolkit include :
dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore – pull in simple JSON data in an array .
You could use this if you simply have a directory of images on your own web server you would like to display
dojox.data.FlickrRestStore ( demo ) – query the Flickr photo sharing website for images .
This is all done on the browser , with no need for any server - side redirects .
This is another of my additions to the Dojo toolkit – I love Flickr , feel free to check out my photo stream here .
I previously wrote another blog post on this data store here .
dojox.data.PicasaStore ( demo ) – query Google ’s Picasa image sharing website for images .
As with the Flickr data store , this is done on the browser , with no need for server side support .
and many more …..
You can also write your own data store if you so desire , but the ones included in the toolkit should cover almost everything you might need .
Gimme , Gimme , Gimme !
So , how can I get this , you ask !
Well , you can :
Update : Dojo 1.0 is now released .
Get it at http://www.dojotoolkit.org/downloads
As always , any and all feedback is welcome .
Also , a big thanks to Peter Higgins , owner of the dojox. image project , and Jared Jurkiewicz , owner of the dojo.data project , for all their helpful ideas , and for reviewing / committing my code to the Dojo project .

That 's the question homeowners are asking in the midst of the worst real estate slump in decades .
Our exclusive calculations can help you figure out what your house will be worth in coming years .

Not sure if this is related to the news of Warner Bros.
going Blu-ray exclusive , but Amazon has this Toshiba HD DVD player with seven movies for only $ 129 ( the same one I thought I got a deal on a month ago for $ 174 ) .
Blu -ray players , of course , are still well above $ 300 .
Amazon also has a bunch of HD DVD movies for $ 15 .
Interestingly , the site has a Blu-ray movie sale going on at the same time .
But the difference between the two sales is a telling story :
The Blu-ray sale has a total of 51 movies on sale with only 8 as low as $ 15 ( and most of them suck ) .
The HD DVD sale , on the other hand , has 84 movies on sale with 63 ( nearly 8 times as many ) at the $ 15 price point .
And there appear to be some decent movies in this mix .
Check out the Blu-ray sale here and the HD DVD sale here and judge for yourself .
For me , though , it seems like this could be phase 1 of HD DVD liquidation .
So the million dollar question is : how much is a high definition DVD player worth to you if it is the format that has lost the war ?
To add to the irony of the less expensive , more consumer - friendly player dying , check out this news : Buyers Beware : Current Blu-ray Players Wo n’t Correctly Play Future Discs and Blu-ray : Early adopters knew what they were getting into .
The titles alone are enough to get any Blu-ray owner frustrated .
The Playstation 3 ( which has Blu- ray built - in ) appears to be the exception , otherwise Blu-ray players on the market are designed without “ future - compatibility capabilities . ”
This means that bonus features on titles released starting in October will not be playable on current Blu-ray players .
Wow .
What makes it even more ironic is that Blu-ray is blaming HD DVD for its problems :
“ When asked why current [ Blu- ray ] players were released to the market in such a primitive state , [ Blu-ray ] manufacturers blamed the release of HD DVD and said it forced them to come to market too soon .
‘ We should have waited another year to introduce Blu-ray to the public , but the format war changed the situation . ’ ”
Feedback is important in any office
Its survey of 2,900 workers found that 29 % of people felt the experience was a waste of time , while 44 % believed their appraiser had been dishonest .
Other concerns include managers failing to address issues raised and a lack of continuous feedback during the year .
Investors in People said appraisals were compromised if managers shirked " difficult issues " .
' Beneficial '
According to the research , annual reviews of staff performance were now commonplace in large organisations .
However , only just over half of people working for organisations with fewer than 250 staff have a yearly appraisal .
Employees are not just after honest but also regular feedback throughout the year
Simon Jones , Investors in People
Of those questioned , 41 % said they thought appraisals were a useful exercise .
But 21 % complained that the process was " unfair " , while 23 % saw it merely as a " box - ticking " exercise not taken seriously by those concerned .
Scepticism about appraisals is highest in the public sector , particularly in central and local government and the civil service .
On the other hand , workers in charities and NGOs are most enchanted with the process .
Investors in People , which works to improve workplace relations and staff development , said appraisals could be " enormously beneficial " for motivating staff and making them feel wanted but only if done properly .
" It is a concern that some managers may be letting down their employees by failing to give full and frank feedback , " said Simon Jones , Investors ' acting UK chief executive .
" Employees are not just after honest but also regular feedback throughout the year so there are n't any big surprises when it comes to the annual review . "
New research on mice could explain why you remember a break - up so vividly but can't for the life of you recall that meeting you had at work .
With information bombarding our senses like the billboard lights in Times Square , our brains can get overloaded .
That 's why memory - storing regions of the brain weed out the trivial and give priority to the significant , which can then get transformed into long - term memory .
The new study , published in the Oct. 5 issue of the journal Cell , reveals how emotions could help the brain " decide " which memories to seal in and which to toss out .
Memories are thought to form with the strengthening of connections between neurons .
These connections rely on receptors to send and receive " brain data . "
Past research has shown that emotional stress is linked with an increase in the hormone norepinephrine in the brain .
Yet , exactly how the stress hormone influences the processes involved in neuron connections and thus memory formation has remained mysterious .
Hailan Hu of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York and colleagues say they have figured part of it out .
They ran lab tests on mice , finding that norepinephrine , as well as emotional stress , leads to a chemical change in certain brain receptors .
The change strengthened connections in the memory regions in mice brains , they say .
" Stimuli that would not be enough to form a memory now can form a memory , " said study team member Roberto Malinow , also of Cold Spring Harbor Lab .
Since mouse brains have many of the same regions as human brains , the researchers expect the same memory mechanisms would apply to us as well .
While both highs and lows in life can spark the memory - boosting chemical , Malinow notes that too much of the stress hormone can backfire , causing a lapse in memory .
" If you have too much norepinephrine it works the opposite way , " Malinow told LiveScience .
" So there might be an optimal amount of norepinephrine so that if you 're too emotional , you might not remember things as well . "
He stressed the finding is just one piece of a large puzzle linking emotions and memory .
This is really amazing .
Yesterday , Major Garrett from Fox News ran with the rumor that Paul Begala was joining the Clinton campaign — and despite repeated , personal denials from Paul Begala , Garrett kept reporting the story .
This says everything you need to know about reporting at Fox News .
Definitely check out Begala ’s post about this over at Huffington .
It ’s illuminating to say the least .
Begala actually includes the e-mails he sent to Garrett — and Garrett ’s responses .
Jacki Schechner , in a post at her blog titled “ Major Disfunction ” , had this to say about Begala , with whom she used to work :
I know Paul .
I like Paul .
A lot .
He ’s a solid guy .
When he recounts this saga , I trust this is exactly how it went down .
I do n’t really know Paul , but I know and trust Jacki .

Eight former senior Republican administration appointees have severely criticized the official account of 9/11 and several have called for a new investigation .
" I find the facts against the official story of the [ WTC ] buildings ' collapse more compelling than the case that has been made in behalf of the official story .
I would like to see the issue debated by independent scientists and engineers , " wrote Paul Craig Roberts , PhD , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Ronald Reagan .
" A real investigation is needed to find an explanation consistent with the evidence , even if it does n't reassure the public , " said Dr. Roberts [ 1 ] , frequently referred to as the " Father of Reagonomics . "
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
" Over the past six years , the ranks of distinguished skeptics of the 9 - 11 storyline have grown enormously .
The ranks include distinguished scientists , engineers and architects , intelligence officers , air traffic controllers , military officers and generals , including the former commanding general of U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command , former presidential appointees and members of the White House staff in Republican administrations , Top Gun fighter pilots and career airline pilots who say that the flying attributed to the 9 - 11 hijackers is beyond the skills of America 's best pilots , and foreign dignitaries . " [ 2 ]
Dr. Roberts currently serves as Chairman of the Institute for Political Economy and Research Fellow at the Independent Institute .
Previously he was the William E. Simon Chair in Political Economy , at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , Georgetown University .
He also served as a Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution , Stanford University , and as Associate Editor of The Wall Street Journal .
In a 2004 interview by Dennis Bernstein on the Flashpoints radio show , Catherine Austin Fitts , former Assistant Secretary of Housing under President George H.W. Bush ( 41 ) said " The official story could not possibly have happened .
In other words , what the administration has put forward is essentially a conspiracy theory that does not conform to the facts .
It 's not possible .
It 's not operationally feasible ...
The Commission was a whitewash . "
Prior to her appointment to the first Bush administration , Ms. Fitts served as Managing Director and Member of the Board of Wall Street investment bank , Dillon , Read & Co .
She previously was President of The Hamilton Securities Group .
In a 2004 essay , Ms. Fitts wrote , " Much has transpired since September 11 , 2001 .
...
We have emerged deeply disturbing unanswered questions of 9 - 11 through global Internet media .
We have worked with [ Paul Thompson 's Complete ] 911 Timeline and realized that the official explanation of events is conspiracy theory , not conforming to documented fact .
We have watched the U.S. government suppress facts and restrict of the 9 - 11 Commission 's access to information .
We have watched the 9 - 11 Commission fail to answer the unanswered questions and concede to official suppression of information .
We have watched the leaders of the national security infrastructure richly rewarded for their failure to protect America on 9 - 11 .
We have noted the material omissions of the corporate media .
Something does not add up .
Someone has something to hide .
... The Administration has something to hide .
Rather than lose time and resources getting lost in the White House fog , let 's follow the alleged advice of one of the 9 - 11 Commissioners , Fred Fielding ... " Follow the Money . " [ 4 ]
In a 2006 video interview with Alex Jones , Morgan Reynolds , PhD , former Chief Economist of the U.S. Department of Labor under current President George W. Bush said , " I first began to suspect that 9/11 was in inside job when the Bush - Cheney Administration invaded Iraq .
...
We can prove that the government 's story is false . " [ 5 ]
Prior to his appointment to the Bush administration , Dr. Reynolds was Director of the Criminal Justice Center at the National Center for Policy Analysis .
He is also Professor Emeritus of Economics , Texas A&M University .
And in a 2005 essay , Dr. Reynolds wrote , " It is hard to exaggerate the importance of a scientific debate over the cause (s ) of the collapse of the Twin Towers [ each 1300 + feet tall , 110 stories ] and Building 7 .
If the official wisdom on the collapses is wrong , as I believe it is , then policy based on such erroneous engineering analysis is not likely [ to ] prove to be sound . " [ 6 ]
WTC Building 7 was 610 feet tall , 47 stories .
It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "
Watch the collapse video here .
And six years after 9/11 , the Federal government has yet to publish its promised final report that explains the cause of its collapse .
Another senior Republican appointee who has questioned the official account of 9/11 is Col. Ronald D. Ray , U.S. Marine Corps ( ret ) , who served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense under President Ronald Reagan .
He 's a highly decorated Vietnam veteran ( two Silver Stars , a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart ) .
He was also appointed by President George H. W. Bush to serve on the American Battle Monuments Commission ( 1990 1994 ) , and on the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces .
He was Military Historian and Deputy Director of Field Operations for the U.S. Marine Corps Historical Center , Washington , D.C. ( 1990 1994 ) .
In an interview on Alex Jones ' radio show on June 30 , 2006 [ 7 ] , Col .
Ray described the official account of 9/11 as " the dog that does n't hunt " , meaning it does n't stand up to scrutiny .
In response to Alex Jones ' question , " Is it safe to say or is the statement accurate that you smell something rotten in the state of Denmark when it comes to 9/11 ? "
Col .
Ray replied , " I 'm astounded that the conspiracy theory advanced by the administration could in fact be true and the evidence does not seem to suggest that that 's accurate .
That 's true . "
Another senior Republican appointee who has questioned the official account of 9/11 is Mary Schiavo .
Appointed under the administration of President George H. W. Bush , Ms. Schiavo served as the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Transportation from 1990 - 1996 .
Ms. Schiavo and her staff secured more than 1,000 criminal convictions and uncovered billions in waste and abuse at the U.S. DOT .
Since leaving the Transportation Department , Ms. Schiavo has represented passenger and crew families in every major U.S. air crash , as well as pilots and passengers on private planes .
In an article written by Gail Sheehy that appeared in the New York Observer [ 8 ] on Feb. 16 , 2004 , Ms. Sheehy wrote , " Ms. Schiavo sat in on the commission 's hearing on aviation security on 9/11 and was disgusted by what it left out .
' In any other situation , it would be unthinkable to withhold investigative material from an independent commission , ' she told this writer .
' There are usually grave consequences .
But the commission is clearly not talking to everybody or not telling us everything . ' "
In a press conference on June 10 , 2002 regarding the events of 9/11 , Ms. Schiavo stated , " First of all , the question is not ' What they [ the U.S. government ] should have known ? '
And I believe I can show you in just a few seconds the question is , ' What did they know ? '
And believe me , they knew a lot .
The second thing to emphasize is that in every single aviation disaster , whether there was intervening criminal activity or not , in every single one in the course of modern aviation history it has been followed by , not only were it necessary , a criminal investigation , but also a National Transportation Safety investigation into what went wrong in the aviation system .
And the reason for that is so that it never happens again . "
Ms. Schiavo continued , " This is the first time , and this is the worst disaster , but this is the first time that families have been attempted to be silenced through a special fund , which I believe is about silence more so than about money .
Why ?
...
And from my rounds on the Hill to find these facts and others , I found that the airlines approached members of Congress and the Senate to get their bailout and their immunity and their protection starting on 9/11 .
They sent their first lobbyist up to the Hill on 9/11 .
And this has been confirmed to me personally by Senators and members of Congress .
Now to me that 's very shocking but to me it raises another question , Why ?
Why did they have to rush to the Hill to change the law ? ...
So in the wake of September 11 , 2001 , when we heard the carriers and governments alike saying , ' Oh , no one could have foreseen this .
No one knew that this was coming .
No one knew that there was any risk like this in the world , ' is absolutely false .
...
In the last thirty years we have had 682 hijackings .
682 . Here 's an interesting statistic .
When we had the United States saying , ' Oh , we could n't have known this . ' " [ 9 ]
Another critic of the official account of 9/11 is Barbara Honegger , who served as Special Assistant to the Chief Domestic Policy Adviser to President Ronald Reagan and as a White House Policy Analyst .
" The US military and intelligence community , not al Qaeda , had the sustained access weeks before 9/11 to also plant controlled demolition charges throughout the superstructures of WTC 1 and WTC 2 , and in WTC 7 , which brought down all three buildings on 9/11 , " she wrote . [ 10 ]
" A US military plane , not one piloted by al Qaeda , performed the highly skilled , steep , high - speed 270 - to 330 - degree dive towards the Pentagon that Dulles Air Traffic Controllers were sure was a military plane as they watched it on their screens that morning .
Only a military aircraft , not a civilian plane flown by al Qaeda , would have given off the " Friendly " signal needed to disable the Pentagon 's anti-aircraft missile batteries as it approached the building .
Only the US military , not al Qaeda , had the ability to break all of its Standard Operating Procedures to paralyze its own emergency response systems on 9/11 . "
Ms. Honegger also served as Project Director of the Attorney General 's Anti-Discrimination Federal Law Review at the U.S. Department of Justice in Reagan 's administration .
She is a graduate of the Naval War College master 's program in National Security Decision Making and for over 12 years has served as Senior Military Affairs Journalist at the Naval Postgraduate School , the U.S. Navy 's and the Defense Department 's premier science , technology and national security affairs university .
Ms. Honegger has become a prominent critic of the official account of 9/11 as a private researcher , author and speaker at conferences .
This is not Ms. Honegger 's first experience with allegations of serious executive branch misconduct .
In 1983 , she resigned from the Reagan administration in protest to planned domestic policy decisions .
In 1989 , she authored the pioneering Irangate expose October Surprise , which led to a full - subpoena - power U.S. House of Representatives investigation .
Her book alleged that prior to the 1980 Presidential election , members of the Reagan campaign cut a secret deal with Iran to delay the release of the 52 American hostages , in order to prevent President Jimmy Carter from arranging their release and prevent him from winning the November election .
The hostages were released on the day of Ronald Reagan 's inauguration , after 444 days in captivity .
Shortly after the release of the 9/11 Commission Report , a group of over 100 prominent Americans signed a petition [ 11 ] urging Congress to immediately reinvestigate 9/11 .
In addition to four prominent former CIA officials [ 12 ] , the signers included Catherine Austin Fitts ( mentioned above ) , Edward Peck , and Morton Goulder .
Edward Peck served as Deputy Director of the White House Task Force on Terrorism under President Ronald Reagan .
Mr. Peck , a 32 - year veteran of the U.S. Foreign Service also served as Deputy Coordinator , Covert Intelligence Programs at the State Department and as U.S. Ambassador and Chief of Mission in Iraq ( 1977 - 1980 ) .
Morton Goulder was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Warning under President Richard Nixon and continued in that capacity under Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter .
In World War II , he served as a Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy .
He is a co-founder of Sanders Associates , a billion dollar defense contractor , now a division of BEA Systems .
The petition stated , in part , " We want truthful answers to questions such as :
1 . Why were standard operating procedures for dealing with hijacked airliners not followed that day ?
2 . Why were the extensive missile batteries and air defenses reportedly deployed around the Pentagon not activated during the attack ?
3 . Why did the Secret Service allow Bush to complete his elementary school visit , apparently unconcerned about his safety or that of the schoolchildren ?
4 . Why has n't a single person been fired , penalized , or reprimanded for the gross incompetence we witnessed that day ?
5 . Why have n't authorities in the U.S. and abroad published the results of multiple investigations into trading that strongly suggested foreknowledge of specific details of the 9/11 attacks , resulting in tens of millions of dollars of traceable gains ? "
These questions and many others still remain unanswered three years after the petition was submitted and six years after the terrible events of 9/11 .
As the statements of these eight senior Republican Administration appointees show , the need for a new thorough , and independent investigation of 9/11 is not a matter of partisan politics , nor the demand of irresponsible , mentally ill , or disloyal Americans .
It is instead a matter of the utmost importance for America 's security and the future of the entire world .
