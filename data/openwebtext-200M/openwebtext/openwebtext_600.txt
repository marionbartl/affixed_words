The deadliest war since Adolf Hitler marched across Europe is starting again – and you are almost certainly carrying a blood - soaked chunk of the slaughter in your pocket .
When we glance at the holocaust in Congo , with 5.4 million dead , the clichés of Africa reporting tumble out : this is a " tribal conflict " in " the Heart of Darkness " .
It is n't .
The United Nations investigation found it was a war led by " armies of business " to seize the metals that make our 21st - century society zing and bling .
The war in Congo is a war about you .
Every day I think about the people I met in the war zones of eastern Congo when I reported from there .
The wards were filled with women who had been gang - raped by the militias and shot in the vagina .
The battalions of child soldiers – drugged , dazed 13 - year - olds who had been made to kill members of their own families so they could n't try to escape and go home .
But oddly , as I watch the war starting again on CNN , I find myself thinking about a woman I met who had , by Congolese standards , not suffered in extremis .
I was driving back to Goma from a diamond mine one day when my car got a puncture .
As I waited for it to be fixed , I stood by the roadside and watched the great trails of women who stagger along every road in eastern Congo , carrying all their belongings on their backs in mighty crippling heaps .
I stopped a 27 - year - old woman called Marie - Jean Bisimwa , who had four little children toddling along beside her .
She told me she was lucky .
Yes , her village had been burned out .
Yes , she had lost her husband somewhere in the chaos .
Yes , her sister had been raped and gone insane .
But she and her kids were alive .

I gave her a lift , and it was only after a few hours of chat along on cratered roads that I noticed there was something strange about Marie - Jean 's children .
They were slumped forward , their gazes fixed in front of them .
They did n't look around , or speak , or smile .
" I have n't ever been able to feed them , " she said .
" Because of the war . "
Their brains had n't developed ; they never would now .
" Will they get better ? " she asked .
I left her in a village on the outskirts of Goma , and her kids stumbled after her , expressionless .
There are two stories about how this war began – the official story , and the true story .
The official story is that after the Rwandan genocide , the Hutu mass murderers fled across the border into Congo .
The Rwandan government chased after them .
But it 's a lie .
How do we know ?
The Rwandan government did n't go to where the Hutu genocidaires were , at least not at first .
They went to where Congo 's natural resources were – and began to pillage them .
They even told their troops to work with any Hutus they came across .
Congo is the richest country in the world for gold , diamonds , coltan , cassiterite , and more .
Everybody wanted a slice – so six other countries invaded .
These resources were not being stolen to for use in Africa .
They were seized so they could be sold on to us .
The more we bought , the more the invaders stole – and slaughtered .
The rise of mobile phones caused a surge in deaths , because the coltan they contain is found primarily in Congo .
The UN named the international corporations it believed were involved : Anglo - America , Standard Chartered Bank , De Beers and more than 100 others .
( They all deny the charges . )
But instead of stopping these corporations , our governments demanded that the UN stop criticising them .
There were times when the fighting flagged .
In 2003 , a peace deal was finally brokered by the UN and the international armies withdrew .
Many continued to work via proxy militias – but the carnage waned somewhat .
Until now .
As with the first war , there is a cover- story , and the truth .
A Congolese militia leader called Laurent Nkunda – backed by Rwanda – claims he needs to protect the local Tutsi population from the same Hutu genocidaires who have been hiding out in the jungles of eastern Congo since 1994 .
That 's why he is seizing Congolese military bases and is poised to march on Goma .
It is a lie .
François Grignon , Africa Director of the International Crisis Group , tells me the truth : " Nkunda is being funded by Rwandan businessmen so they can retain control of the mines in North Kivu .
This is the absolute core of the conflict .
What we are seeing now is beneficiaries of the illegal war economy fighting to maintain their right to exploit . "
At the moment , Rwandan business interests make a fortune from the mines they illegally seized during the war .
The global coltan price has collapsed , so now they focus hungrily on cassiterite , which is used to make tin cans and other consumer disposables .
As the war began to wane , they faced losing their control to the elected Congolese government – so they have given it another bloody kick - start .
Yet the debate about Congo in the West – when it exists at all – focuses on our inability to provide a decent bandage , without mentioning that we are causing the wound .
It 's true the 17,000 UN forces in the country are abysmally failing to protect the civilian population , and urgently need to be super - charged .
But it is even more important to stop fuelling the war in the first place by buying blood - soaked natural resources .
Nkunda only has enough guns and grenades to take on the Congolese army and the UN because we buy his loot .
We need to prosecute the corporations buying them for abetting crimes against humanity , and introduce a global coltan - tax to pay for a substantial peacekeeping force .
To get there , we need to build an international system that values the lives of black people more than it values profit .
Somewhere out there – lost in the great global heist of Congo 's resources – are Marie - Jean and her children , limping along the road once more , carrying everything they own on their backs .
They will probably never use a coltan - filled mobile phone , a cassiterite - smelted can of beans , or a gold necklace – but they may yet die for one .

Mathematical card tricks
Martin Gardner 's 1956 classic Mathematics , Magic and Mystery ( Dover ) was the first book targeted at a mathematical audience to gather in one place some of the great mathematics - based card ( and other magic ) tricks .
Bill Simon 's Mathematical Magic ( Dover ) from 1964 was second .
Starting in the 1950's , and continuing without a break well into the 1980s , Gardner 's enormously popular Scientific American column proved to be the perfect vehicle for further expositions along the same lines .
Many of these columns on card tricks were given additional visibility over the past four decades in fifteen book collections ( with another one on the way soon ! ) .
Gardner 's recent Mental Magic ( Sterling , 1999 ) book for children , and his ``Modeling Mathematics with Playing Cards ' ' article in the May , 2000 issue of Mathematics Magazine , are also well worth exploring .
Additional relevant tricks can be found in several excellent books by Karl Fulves ( also published by Dover ) , and numerous slim volumes by Bob Longe ( Sterling ) .
Harder to find -- but certainly available from any good specialty magic dealer -- are Steve Beam 's impressive Semi-Automatic Card Tricks books ( Trapdoor Productions ) , which also contain routines of interest to the mathematically minded .
Much of the material contained here was originally organized in connection with a March 2000 MAA short course entitled ``An Introduction to Mathematical Card Tricks , '' given jointly with Jeffrey Ehme of Spelman College at the 79th Annual MAA Southeastern Section Meeting , UNC Charlotte , Charlotte , North Carolina .
We are very grateful to Martin Gardner for graciously allowing us to reproduce some of the tricks he has written about in the past , and to Gathering for Gardner co-organizer Tom Rodgers of Atlanta for his generosity with magical contacts .
Special thanks go to Magic Castle librarian and magic inventor Gordon Bean , and author and magic inventor Steve Beam for input on the history and origins of some of the tricks .
Thanks to Jen Chang and the Center for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics for permission to use their card - face images .
Thanks also to Ron Gould and Pete Winkler , and especially to Paul Zorn of St. Olaf 's College , who unwittingly got us started on this journey over a microbrewed beer during a recent Joint Winter Meeting .
1. Card Tricks and Mathematics
Card tricks have long been a mainstay of the magic community , and there are many fine effects using a standard deck of 52 cards that will interest lovers of mathematics .
Popular techniques of card legerdemain involve forcing , controlling , location , prediction , reversal , transposition , spelling and so - called mind reading .
Basic methods are counting ( often secretly ) , reversing cards , prearranging some ( or all ) of the deck , and shuffling of various sorts .
The tricks we discuss have underlying principles with real mathematical content , ranging from basic arithmetic , binary numbers and permutations to combinatorics and probability .
Mathematically - based card tricks can be used to liven up many mathematics classes , from precalculus and discrete math to abstract algebra , number theory and probability .
Even better , such tricks are invaluable as a tool for convincing non-mathematics students that math can be fun and , moreover , forms the basis for certain ``real '' magic tricks ( the sort some entertainers do for a living ) .
Perhaps , by exposing students to a few tricks along these lines , we can instill them a healthy balance of respect ( for the performance and entertainment aspects ) and scepticism ( every trick has a logical explanation ) for things magical !
This fits in well with the philosophy of any mathematics course which aim to equip students with quantitavive reasoning and quantitative literacy skills .
Tricky business
``Mathematical card tricks , let it be admitted at once , are precisely the kind of tricks that are the most boring to most people , '' warned Martin Gardner as recently as 1983 in Wheels , Life and Other Mathematical Amusements ( W.H. Freeman & Co ) .
However , the routines we consider are unlikely to bore anyone with an interest in mathematics , and even professional magicians have been known to perform them accompanied by appropriate show business trappings ( and without advertising the tricks ' mathematical underpinnings ) .
The person you perform a trick for , who often assists in some way , is usually referred to as the victim .
There are four basic card handling skills needed to perform the tricks considered here : peeking , cutting , overhand shuffling , and riffle shuffling .
If these sound familiar , you are ready to proceed to the first trick .
Otherwise , click on the link above .
Please see Tips of the trade for some important words of advice on magic performance and ethics .
In particular , remember the
Golden Rule of Magic ---
Never reveal your secrets !
If you are performing for a ``lay audience , '' you really should think twice before divulging how a trick works .
If you are performing for intellectually curious spectators , such as colleagues or motivated students , it 's different .
Give people hints and let them work out some of it themselves , it 's far more rewarding than being handed the whole trick on a plate .
This applies to you too ! -- try to work out the tricks as you go along , you 'll be glad you did !
It is also a mistake , in general , to repeat a trick for an audience , even if asked to .
There are exceptions , of course , which we note .
Have fun !

CHAUVINISTIC men can be petty and infuriating , but that might be as far as it goes .
Women are more unnerved by not knowing a man ’s views than by overt sexism – so much so that they perform worse in exams .
Rodolfo Mendoza - Denton at the University of California , Berkeley , asked 170 female undergraduates to take a written test .
Before the test they were randomly assigned to one of three empty offices , which they were told belonged to their male examiner .
The fictional offices were furnished in one of three ways to allow the students to infer the examiner ’s view of women .

Could Twitter become terrorists ' newest killer app ?
A draft Army intelligence report , making its way through spy circles , thinks the miniature messaging software could be used as an effective tool for coordinating militant attacks .
For years , American analysts have been concerned that militants would take advantage of commercial hardware and software to help plan and carry out their strikes .
Everything from online games to remote - controlled toys to social network sites to garage door openers has been fingered as possible tools for mayhem .
This recent presentation – put together on the Army 's 304th Military Intelligence Battalion and found on the Federation of the American Scientists website – focuses on some of the newer applications for mobile phones : digital maps , GPS locators , photo swappers , and Twitter mash - ups of it all .
The report is roughly divided into two halves .
The first is based mostly on chatter from Al - Qaeda - affiliated online forums .
One Islamic extremist site discusses , for example , the benefits of " using a mobile phone camera to monitor the enemy and its mechanisms . "
Another focuses on the benefits of the Nokia 6210 Navigator , and how its GPS utilities could be used for " marksmanship , border crossings , and in concealment of supplies . "
Such software could allow jihadists to pick their way across multiple routes , identifying terrain features as they go .
A third extremist forum recommends the installation of voice - modification software to conceal one 's identity when making calls .
Excerpts from a fourth site show cell phone wallpapers that wannabe jihadists can use to express their affinity for radicalism :
Then the presentation launches into an even - more theoretical discussion of how militants might pair some of these mobile applications with Twitter , to magnify their impact .
After all , " Twitter was recently used as a countersurveillance , command and control , and movement tool by activists at the Republican
National Convention , " the report notes .
" The activists would Tweet each other and their Twitter pages to add information on what was happening with Law Enforcement near real time . "
Terrorists have n't done anything similar , the Army report concedes - although it does note that there are " multiple pro and anti Hezbollah Tweets . "
Instead , the presentation lays out three possible scenarios in which Twitter could become a militant 's friend :
Scenario 1 : Terrorist operative “ A ” uses Twitter with … a cell phone camera / video function to send back messages , and to receive messages , from the rest of his
[ group ] ...
Other members of his [ group ] receive near real time updates
( similar to the movement updates that were sent by activists at the
RNC ) on how , where , and the number of troops that are moving in order to conduct an ambush .
Scenario 2 : Terrorist operative “ A ”
has a mobile phone for Tweet messaging and for taking images .
Operative
“ A ” also has a separate mobile phone that is actually an explosive device and / or a suicide vest for remote detonation .
Terrorist operative
“ B ” has the detonator and a mobile to view “ A’s ” Tweets and images .
This may allow ” B ” to select the precise moment of remote detonation based on near real time movement and imagery that is being sent by “ A . ”
Scenario 3 :
Cyber Terrorist operative “ A ” finds U.S. [ soldier ]
Smith ’s Twitter account .
Operative “ A ” joins Smith ’s Tweets and begins to elicit information from Smith .
This information is then used for … identity theft , hacking , and / or physical [ attacks ] .
This scenario… has already been discussed for other social networking sites , such as My Space and / or Face Book .
Steven Aftergood , a veteran intelligence analyst at the Federation of the American Scientists , does n't dismiss the Army presentation out of hand .
But nor does he think it 's tackling a terribly seriously threat .
" Red -teaming exercises to anticipate adversary operations are fundamental .
But they need to be informed by a sense of what 's realistic and important and what 's not , " he tells Danger Room .
" If we have time to worry about ' Twitter threats ' then we 're in good shape .
I mean , it 's important to keep some sense of proportion . "

As revenue heads south , smart newspapers are looking at different ways they can adapt to survive .
At the extreme end , The Christian Science Monitor announced yesterday that it was moving to a primarily online model and abandoning their weekday print edition .
Other papers have embraced blogging and new media tools such as Twitter , attempting to offer something extra online in an attempt to attract readers and drive online revenue growth .
There ’s no magic solution yet : online revenue is not replacing lost offline revenue but most recognize that things have to change if newspapers are to survive in any form ( such as online only ) in the near future .
So what do some American journalists think about their employers trying to keep their heads above water in a rapidly changing pace ?
Apparently new media tools create too much work , and may do nothing to help newspapers .
“ Leading journalists ” speaking at a National Press Club forum at the University of Missouri Monday told the audience that there is scant evidence that new technology can save journalism jobs and support the news business .
“ I have been blogging for years , ” said Tony Messenger , a state capital bureau correspondent for the St. Louis Post - Dispatch .
“ I have yet to have a discussion in my newsroom about why we ’re blogging and to tie that somehow into the newspaper ’s business model . ”
Messenger also covered a gubernatorial election debate on Twitter and only 13 people followed him , proving that new media tools do n’t deliver ; “ how can we save jobs in the newsroom if we do this ? ”
Elaine Sciolino , the Paris correspondent for the New York Times , complained that blogging and creating video for the web made her job way too hard , but she is n’t given a choice “ If you want to be a journalist today , you just have to work harder and more efficiently .
You aim for perfection until your deadline , and then you aim for doneness .
You just gut it out . ”
Sciolino though earns bonus points for not just being a whinger , but also a kook as well , suggesting that
newsapers cutting back on foreign correspondents is a clear and present danger to the American people :
“ The decline in American newspapers is a major national security threat , ” she said .
Jennifer Reeves , a Reynolds Institute Fellow said many news organizations were only embracing new technology because it is cool ( her word ) , not because it delivers a better product : “ A lot of newsrooms need to take a breath and see if the markets need it and find a way to use it logically ” she said .
Apparently having to blog is driving journalists out of the profession and into public relations positions for school boards , according to Charles Davis , director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition and a Missouri professor .
There ’s some substance in the need for newspapers to refine their use of new media tools to best deliver improved outcomes as they all rocket towards oblivion .
However for journalists to whine about newspapers trying to survive , and trying to actually make enough money to keep paying the very journalists whining … well , there ’s more than competition from the internet that is killing newspapers , it would appear that the journalists are as well .
Of course it ’s unfair to generalize : there are many very fine , hard working journalists out there who get what is going on , and are embracing the changes in the market , but too often we are reminded that for a hard core of traditionalists , new media remains the enemy that should be ignored , dying businesses be damned .
CROWN POINT , Ind . ( AP ) —
A judge weighing whether to close down early voting sites in Lake County ’s Democratic strongholds questioned local officials about the absentee voting process during visits to the disputed sites .
Lake County Superior Court Judge Diane Kavadias - Schneider toured the Gary , Hammond and East Chicago satellite voting sites Monday and heard hours of testimony and arguments on whether they are legal and fair .
Republicans want to shut down the centers in the largely Democratic county on the grounds that they will increase the likelihood of vote fraud in the Nov. 4 election .
Kavadias - Schneider , who was appointed a special judge in the case by the Indiana Supreme Court , questioned county elections board director Sally LaSota on Monday about the process of early voting and safeguards against vote fraud .
LaSota assured the judge that the elections board staff ensures voters are registered and do n’t vote more than once .
When Kavadias - Schneider asked , “ What of those who have already voted ? ” R. Lawrence Steele , a GOP lawyer , replied , “ Maybe those votes should be discarded . ”
Indiana Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathryn Dolan said Tuesday that Kavadias - Schneider has indicated that she hopes to rule either Tuesday or Wednesday on the satellite voting centers .
Gary Mayor Rudy Clay said Monday that as long as the people who voted at the satellite sites were legal voters their votes will be counted .
“ I know the ( GOP ) party says they ’ll be thrown out , but that ’s more scare tactics , ” Clay said .
“ We ’ve been talking to lawyers from here all the way up to D.C. , and we ’re told they ca n’t be thrown out . ”
He said Gary posted a 91 percent vote for Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama in the May primary .
Indiana ’s deadline for early voting in the General Election is noon on Nov. 3 .
Kavadias - Schneider asked LaSota on Monday about possibly opening even more early in - person voting centers in suburban communities in response to Republican complaints that Democrats have opened voting in the county ’s three largest Democratic strongholds .
But Steele told the judge that Republicans do n’t want more early voting centers open — they want the Gary , Hammond and East Chicago ’s centers closed .
Democrats say the additional early voting centers are needed and appropriate because they are located in branches of the county clerk ’s offices .
Some Democrats say Republicans are trying to suppress the vote in urban areas that have large minority and low - income residents , who may favor Obama over Republican John McCain .
FBI Begins Investigation into Florida Democrat who Replaced Mark Foley
The Democrat who won the Florida seat that was held by disgraced Republican Mark Foley has been caught in his own little sex scandal .
Considering that Foley had to resign in his own sex scandal , if you can call mere inappropriate emails and text messages a sex scandal , this is just too ironic .
Tim Mahoney “ allegedly ” paid a mistress of his over $ 120,000 to keep her from going public , and there are rumors of a second affair .
Mark Foley ’s seat was not considered in play in 2006 until the scandal broke , and then the calls for his resignation came from both Democrats and Republicans .
But when this scandal broke here is what the Democrats said :
Senior Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives , including Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) , the chair of the Democratic Caucus , have been working with Mahoney to keep the matter from hurting his re-election campaign
Suddenly this is a private matter and should not affect the outcome of the election .
It ’s funny the difference in thinking within the Democrat party depending on which party the perpetrator is in .
Now the FBI is investigating Mahoney , and justice may be served as he is considering not running for re-election .
The FBI has reportedly begun its own preliminary investigation into an ABC News report that West Palm Beach Congressman Tim Mahoney ( D - FL ) hired an alleged mistress to work on his official staff and then paid her $ 121,000 to keep her from going public and filing suit after she was fired .
But the whole kicker in this is the following :
According to the Mahoney staffers , his secret agreement with the woman , Patricia Allen , began in 2006 when he was campaigning for office , vowing to remove the “ ethical cloud ” he said had been left over the district by Republican Mark Foley
This whole affair ( pardon the pun ) was happening as he was campaigning for Mark Foley ’s seat .
This whole affair was taking place even as he was vowing to be more ethical than his predecessor .
He was saying one thing in public even as he was acting in the opposite manner .
This man is nothing but a hypocrite .

Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain sat down with CNN's Larry King on " Larry King Live " on Wednesday .
Among the topics were Gov. Sarah Palin 's readiness to lead the country and whether McCain 's Democratic rival , Sen. Barack Obama , is a socialist .
The full transcript is below .
The interview aired at 9 p.m. ET Wednesday on CNN .
LARRY KING , HOST : Sen .
John McCain , Republican of Arizona , candidate for the presidency of the United States , is it getting to be an ordeal ?
MCCAIN : No .
This is the most exciting time , getting in the last few days , the crowds are bigger .
There is more enthusiasm .
The polls close and ...
KING : Are you anxious ?
MCCAIN : No .
You know , you put one foot ahead of the other .
But you just have got to keep your eye on the ball and know that every hour now is precious , because the rapidity in the news cycle , and you know , getting those undecided voters that I think are going to decide this election ...
KING : Are you worried ?
MCCAIN : ... not only on your side , but out .
KING : Are you worried ?
MCCAIN : Well , I do n't think it's ...
( CROSSTALK )
MCCAIN : I do n't think it 's " worried . "
I think , obviously , I know we 're still the underdog .
We 're now 2 or 3 or 4 points down .
And we 've got six days to go to make that up .
But it 's not a matter of worry ; it 's just , you know , you and I have been together long enough , you know I love the underdog status .
I just want to leave that status at the time the polls close .
( CROSSTALK )
( LAUGHTER )
KING : ... be favored .
All right .
Sen. Obama had a 30 - minute ad buy tonight .
It ran right before we went on the air .
Does that make it hard for you , the amount of money being spent against you ?
MCCAIN : Well , let me tell what 's ...
KING : Frankly ?
MCCAIN : Let me -- frankly , what 's disturbing about it is that he signed a piece of paper back when he was a long shot candidate .
And he signed it , said I wo n't -- I will take public financing for the presidential campaign if John McCain will .
I mean , it 's a living document .
He did n't tell the American people the truth .
And then twice he looked into the camera when he was in debate with Sen.
Clinton and said , " I 'll sit down and negotiate with John McCain before I decide on public financing . "
Well , he did n't tell the American people the truth .
He never had any -- I 'm still waiting for the call .
So -- and what has happened now is that there are hundreds of millions of dollars that are undocumented credit cards .
And we do n't know where they came from ; we do n't know who contributed it .
And all my career , I 've been trying to increase transparency , accountability , and bring courage ( phonetic ) to the flow of money .
You tell me the next time now a presidential candidate will take public financing when Sen.
Obama has shown you can raise millions of dollars .
KING : ( INAUDIBLE )
MCCAIN : And so we do n't know who those donors are .
Their response will be , oh , well , they 're just small donors .
We do n't know that .
We do n't know that , because they 're undocumented .
KING : All right .
( CROSSTALK )
MCCAIN : We document every penny ...
( CROSSTALK )
KING : If it was n't a change of mind , what are you suspicious of ?
MCCAIN : What am I suspicious ...
KING : You make it sound like you 're suspicious of something .
MCCAIN : Well , whenever you have hundreds of millions of dollars undocumented in campaign contributions , these are the " small contributions , " of course it opens itself up to question , because the one thing we need in financing of campaigns and contributions is transparency .
Sen . Obama has not told the American people the truth .
So therefore he now is able to buy these half - hour infomercials and , frankly , is going to try to convince the American people through his rhetoric what his record shows that he 's not .
KING : You told me some time ago , like back in February , that what you wanted this race to be was clean .
You wanted the race solely based on issues .
What happened ?
MCCAIN : Well , the first thing that happened is that I asked Sen .
Obama urgently and repeatedly to come and do town hall meetings with me the way Jack Kennedy and Barry Goldwater had agreed to do before the tragedy of Dallas intervened .
When you 're on the stage with someone , and you 're -- every few days , and you 're having to talk to the American people directly , that changes the tenor of an entire campaign .
You know that , you 've seen it , and I 've seen it .
So he refused .
So he refused to do that .
Now , the fact is that Sen .
Obama now has paid more for negative advertising against me than any presidential campaign in history , in history .
KING : And you have n't done that ?
MCCAIN : Of course we have run ads that point out his record and also point out his associations .
And I still think , you know , we 're watching now , a major newspaper has a tape that apparently has Mr. William Ayers in it .
I do n't know if it does or not .
That 's the allegation .
But that newspaper and their parent , the Tribune Company , and the Obama campaign refuse to release that .
Should n't the American people know about that ?
At least they should have full information .
KING : Speaking of newspapers , there is The L.A. Times .
MCCAIN : Yes .
KING : They apparently -- your campaign says that they 're suppressing videotape of a 2003 banquet when Barack Obama praised Palestinian activist and scholar Rashid Khalidi .
What is this all -- what is this ?
MCCAIN : Why should n't they ...
KING : Why would the paper suppress this ?
MCCAIN : I have no idea .
If they have the tape , they ought to make the American people aware of it , let them see it and make their own judgment .
Frankly , I 've been in a lot of political campaigns , a whole lot , I 've never seen anything like this , where a major media outlet has information and a tape of some occasion -- maybe it means nothing , maybe it 's just a social event , I do n't know , but why should they not release it ?
And why should n't the Obama campaign want it released ?
KING : Is this Palestinian some sort of terrorist ?
MCCAIN : We know that at that time , the PLO was a terrorist organization .
KING : He was PLO ?
MCCAIN : Yes , yes -- that 's what the allegation is , Larry .
I have n't seen the tape .
So -- but we should see the tape to make it -- the American people make a judgment .
KING : We 'll be right back with Sen. John McCain .
Do n't go away .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : OK .
You 're hot and heavy in these red states .
You 're -- the final week , you 're in Florida , Virginia , North Carolina , Ohio , Colorado and New Mexico , I think all of those states went for George Bush four years ago .
What 's -- why would these be the states ?
MCCAIN : Well , they are -- we 're within margin of error .
Look , this is a tough campaign , as you know , we 've come from a long way back , and we 're now very close .
But those are contested states , and I think we can win in New Hampshire .
I have such a long relationship there that -- and that was a -- previously a state that did n't -- that President Bush did n't get .
But these are contested states .
I mean , there is no doubt we 've got to hold them in order to win .
KING : Senator , are you hampered , frankly , by the Bush record ?
Be honest .
MCCAIN : Well , you know , I think that that 's a very intelligent campaign tactic on the part of the Obama campaign .
Moveon.org a long time ago ran the ads , you know , President Bush and I together .
But I think that the American people realize that I 'm very different in many ways , whether it be spending or the conduct of the war in Iraq or climate change .
Or treatment of prisoners for a number of other issues .
But , look , I think that any campaign tactic that they want to use that 's acceptable to the American people , is certainly right to do that .
KING : I mean , do you think that 's the reason that it 's close in states that he won ?
MCCAIN : I think -- no .
I think it 's close in states that he won because most of those states have been back and forth , as you know .
Ohio , the last candidate to lose Ohio and still achieve the presidency was John F. Kennedy .
So , it 's gone back and forth between the winners in Ohio .
They get to see a lot of candidates .
And the same thing is true of Pennsylvania , to a degree .
You know , the states we 're talk -- Florida , my God .
We all remember Florida in 2000 .
So , these have been traditionally battleground states .
KING : Did you think your vice presidential nominee would be as controversial as she is ?
MCCAIN : You know , I did n't think she would be so controversial .
But , I got to tell you , every time I 'm around her , I 'm uplifted .
This is a solid , dedicated reformer .
A fine governor .
The most popular governor in America .
She ignites crowds in a way that -- I got to be honest with you -- and I 'm not a immodest person .
But , I have n't seen a candidate ignite people the way that Sarah Palin has .
I love her family .
And it 's just been a great joy for me to be -- to have her with me .
KING : Are you ticked , for lack of a better term , about the discord reported between her camp and your camp ?
MCCAIN : No .
You know what happens with these things .
First of all , I have about 5,000 " top advisers " that can be quoted by the media .
But , we get along fine .
Sarah 's a maverick .
I 'm a maverick .
No one expected us to agree on everything .
Look , I 'm going to go up -- you know , I 'm against drilling in ANWR , OK ?
I know that I 'm going to have to go up to ANWR and look at it again after I 'm elected because Sarah will drag me up there .
We have disagreements on some specifics .
But we share the same values , the same principles , the same goals for this country .
And I 'm so proud -- she was a reformer .
She took on a governor of her own party after she thought that wrong - doing was going on .
That 's the kind of person she is .
KING : OK .
Fair question .
MCCAIN : Sure .
KING : The president --
MCCAIN : Anything 's a fair question .
KING : You 're president of the United States , you 're flying over the Pacific between nowhere and nowhere .
There 's an attack on the United States .
How much confidence do you have in Vice President Palin ?
MCCAIN : Total .
KING : Total ?
MCCAIN : She has the instincts ; she shares my world view .
She has -- look , I would remind you that there was a obscure governor from Arkansas , that not too many years ago -- that gained the presidency .
And he had no national security experience .
He would never match up , as much as I love Bush I , with him on national security .
We had just won the Gulf War .
Sarah Palin understands these issues .
She understands them very well .
And frankly , with a lot of conversations that I 've had with her , she 's incredibly quick study .
Watch McCain discuss his confidence in Palin
KING : So , there would be no question in your mind that she could take over ?
MCCAIN : She not only would take over ; she would inspire Americans .
That 's what I think she would do .
She would unite the country in a time crisis .
KING : And you like her --
MCCAIN : By the way , I do n't like this comment about me being dying .
You do n't want to --
KING : I did n't say dying .
I said you 're over Pacific .
( CROSSTALK )
MCCAIN : Oh , excuse me .
I did n't hear --
KING : Not seriously , OK .
MCCAIN : OK .
Over the Pacific , not in communication .
KING : We 'll be right back .
Do n't go away .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : All right .
We 're back with Sen. John McCain .
MCCAIN : Could I just mention one thing before we -- Sarah Palin ?
We 're one team , we 're together .
You 're going to have , with all the advisers and counselors and all that , there 's always a little friction within different camps and all that .
KING : But your camp has been criticizing her .
MCCAIN : Oh , yes .
But , you know .
KING : You let that go ?
MCCAIN : It 's just nonsense .
It 's nonsense .
And we 've put out -- you know , I 've said to everybody , look , if anybody has a complaint , take it to me or Sarah .
But our relationship and our teamwork could n't be -- I could n't be happier .
KING : You do n't believe Barack Obama is a socialist , do you ?
MCCAIN : No .
But , I do believe -- I do believe that he 's been in the far left of American politics .
He has stated time after time that he believes in " spreading the wealth around . "
He 's talked about courts that would redistribute the wealth .
He has a record of voting against tax cuts and for tax increases .
And I do n't think there 's any doubt that he would increase spending and he would , sooner or later , we would be increasing taxes .
There is no doubt in my mind that that 's what his record -- 94 times he voted to cut taxes -- against tax cuts and for tax increases .
He voted for -- and that 's what matters .
Not rhetoric .
To raise taxes on individuals making $ 42,000 a year .
KING : Concerning spreading the wealth , is n't the graduated income tax spreading the wealth ?
If you and I paid more so that Jimmy can get some for him , or pay for a welfare recipient , that 's spreading the wealth .
MCCAIN : Well , that 's spreading the wealth in the respect that we do have a graduated income tax .
That 's a far cry from taking from one group of Americans and giving to another .
I mean , that 's dramatically different .
Sen .
Obama clearly has talked about for years , redistributive policies .
And that 's not the way we create wealth in America .
That 's not the way we grow our economy .
That 's not the way we create jobs .
And when small business people see that half of their income , half of the income of small businesses is going to be taxed by Sen , Obama , then they 're very upset with it .
KING : He says , it 's only the personal income tax .
If you run a store , if you make $ 250,000 or more , as a personal income , not a business income , that 's where he 's ( INAUDIBLE ) .
MCCAIN : And that 's where his folks just reduced it to $ 200,000 .
And then Sen. Biden yesterday said $ 150,000 .
And the fact is that if Joe the Plumber is able to buy the business that he works in , the guy that he buys it from is going to see an increase in capital gains taxes .
They 're going to see an increase in payroll taxes .
They 're going to see -- if he reaches a certain level , an increase in his income taxes .
And that 's what got people concerned .
That 's what 's got Joe the Plumber upset .
He wants to redistribute the money .
KING : Does n't taxes pay for services ?
MCCAIN : Taxes pay for services .
KING : ( INAUDIBLE ) taxes .
MCCAIN : But , do we want -- taxes pay to keep our government secure .
To help those who can't help themselves .
And other functions of government , which , by the way , expanded by some 40 percent in the last eight years and gave us a $ 10 trillion debt --
KING : Under Bush .
MCCAIN : And to the last two years , under Democrat majorities in the House and Senate .
But , that 's the job of government .
But it is not the job of government that I believe in , that would take a group of Americans who have some money and say , we 're taking your money , and we 're giving it to others .
This 95 percent tax cut he 's talking about for 95 percent of Americans -- 40 percent of Americans pay no income tax .
So he is just going to give them some money .
Where is he going to get it ?
He is increasing taxes for other groups of Americans .
That 's his plan .
KING : What are you going to do ?
MCCAIN : I 'm going to keep taxes low .
I 'm going to ...
KING : Where they are ?
MCCAIN : Sure .
Absolutely .
And double the exemption for every child in America .
Give them $ 5,000 to go out and buy the health insurance that they can't afford today .
That 's for a specific purpose , a refundable tax credit .
KING : And how are you going to wipe out the deficit in one term ?
MCCAIN : By growing the economy .
By growing the economy .
You know , when Ronald Reagan came to office , inflation was double - digit , interest rates were double - digit , unemployment were double - digit , and everybody said , you can't do it by cutting taxes and by increasing wealth and having our economy improve .
Honest to God , Larry , we have to get this economy out of the ditch we 're in .
And to increase taxes at that time , well , even Sen .
Obama some time ago said , well , maybe he would forgo these tax increases if we had a bad economy .
I 've got news :
We 're in a bad economy .
KING : We 'll be back with our remaining moments with Sen.
John McCain right after this .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : We 're back with our remaining moments with Sen.
John McCain of Arizona , the top two issues : the economy , the war on terror .
Would you use Vice President Palin in these areas ?
MCCAIN : Yes .
But I really would focus her on reform , because she reformed the government in Alaska .
Energy issues , she negotiated a $ 40 billion pipeline of natural gas to the lower 48 , and also to special - needs families .
Special - needs families need a lot of attention in America today .
Every town hall meeting I come to , there is a child that is brought that has autism or Downs , and the way they relate to Sarah is wonderful .
And I would certainly -- I think she 's totally qualified ...
KING : So you would specialize ...
( CROSSTALK )
MCCAIN : ... to address those priorities immediately .
KING : Rush Limbaugh said that Powell 's endorsement -- Colin Powell 's endorsement of your opponent was all about race , something you say you do n't agree with , right ?
MCCAIN : No .
KING : Of course , well , how could someone see it from someone 's mind ...
( CROSSTALK )
MCCAIN : I just do n't .
I do n't ...
KING : Do you see race ...
MCCAIN : ... think that at all and ...
KING : Do you see race as ...
MCCAIN : ... I reject it .
KING : Do you see race as any factor in this race ?
MCCAIN : It -- look , there is racism in America .
We all know that , because we can't stop working against it .
But I am totally convinced that 99 and 44/100 percent of the American people are going to make a decision on who is best to lead this country .
These are one of the most difficult times in our history , both domestically and national security .
I have faith in the American people that they 'll make the judgment for the best of reasons , not the worst of reasons .
KING : So , it 'll be a small minority that would vote , say , against --
MCCAIN : It would be a tiny minority .
It would be a tiny , tiny minority .
Because people are hurting too much now .
I mean , they 're worried about staying in their homes , keeping their jobs .
I do n't have to tell you all these things .
So , I believe in fundamentally in the decency of the American people , and that 's why I believe we 're going to come out of this economic crisis we 're in .
KING : Sen .
Biden , you mentioned him earlier .
He uses words such as " erratic , " " lurching , " " angry , " in referring to you .
He says Obama represents a steady hand of leadership .
First of all --
MCCAIN : When has Sen. Obama displayed that ?
KING : Do you have a temper ?
MCCAIN : Do I get angry ?
Americans are angry right now .
They 're angry at the excess and greed in Wall Street and in Washington .
They 're very angry .
And I 'm angry with them .
KING : What do you make of Biden saying " erratic " ?
MCCAIN : Joe , the Biden , I say , thank you .
KING : Joe the Biden --
MCCAIN : I say , Joe , thank you for pointing out that if Sen .
Obama is going to be president , he 's going to be tested by an international crisis .
That really helps , because Americans know that I 've been tested .
KING : Are you friendly with Sen. Biden ?
MCCAIN : Oh , sure .
Yes , yes , of course .
And , by the way , if we 're an idiom ( phonetic ) , can I say you and I have been together for many years and we 've had interview on every kind of issue and I 'd like to again say thanks for the way you inform the American people .
KING : Thank you .
And we always will remember that debate in South Carolina .
MCCAIN : Yes , you did great .
KING : A couple of other things --
MCCAIN : I did n't do so great , but you did .
KING : You did fine that day .
It was -- the deck was stacked .
MCCAIN : There you go .
KING : The Federal Reserve just announced today , they 're cutting Federal fund rate by a half a point , lowering it to one point .
Any comment ?
MCCAIN : Yes .
I think it 's probably necessary .
I think it 's necessary , and we need -- but could I finally say -- the most important thing is to get a floor on these housing -- on housing .
It was the housing crisis that got us into it .
Go out , but these mortgages , give people a new mortgage at a payment level they can afford and reverse this alarming trend in decreasing value of homes .
Let people realize the American Dream and stay in their homes .
That 's what we 've got to do .
And I 'm very disappointed in the administration for not doing it .
They had the FDIC recently was critical of the administration .
Get those mortgages bought up , keep people in their homes .
KING : But , you favor that move today ?
MCCAIN : Yes .
I think it 's --
KING : In 2000 , you were the darling of the press .
Do you think it 's changed ?
Do you think the press has treated you fairly ?
MCCAIN : Honestly , I cannot complain about the media .
I have seen other politicians do it .
I 'm playing the hand I 'm dealt .
I believe I 'm going to win this race , and I believe that at the end of the day that the American people will make the right decision .
And I can't tell you how humbled I am to have had this incredible opportunity that very rarely happens to any American .
You know , I 'm a guy that 's had a little bit humble beginnings , who only wanted to be a Navy pilot .
KING : Obama says that there 's a lot he likes about you .
What do you like about him ?
MCCAIN : Oh , he 's inspired a lot of Americans .
He 's very eloquent .
He 's --
I know , a good father to his children .
He has done a remarkable job in getting people involved in the political process .
KING : And you always have .
MCCAIN : Thank you .
KING : John , thank you .
Sen. John McCain .
We 'll be right back .
We need your support so Novinite.com can keep delivering news and information about Bulgaria !
Thank you !

( CNN ) -- Sens. John McCain , Barack Obama and Joe Biden will be in Washington on Wednesday to vote on the $ 700 billion bank rescue plan .
The vote , scheduled to happen at sundown Wednesday evening , comes two days after the House failed to pass the controversial economic recovery plan .
Sen .
John McCain proposes increasing federal bank deposit insurance from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
" If there 's a vote tomorrow night , I will be there , " Obama told CNN Tuesday night .
The bill adds provisions -- include raising the FDIC insurance cap from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 -- and will be attached to an existing revenue bill that the House also rejected Monday , according to several Democratic leadership aides .
The legislation also includes a " Mental Health Parity " provision , which would require health insurance companies to cover mental illness at parity with physical illness .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , announced the plan Tuesday .
He said he hoped that the changes made to the bailout plan would be approved by senators on both sides of the aisle .
" I believe that this legislative package will ensure that the needs of Main Street are not forgotten , " said Reid .
McCain spoke earlier Tuesday at an economic roundtable in Des Moines , Iowa .
" We did n't do a good enough job .
We 'll go at it .
I 'm glad to stay at it .
That 's what my job is as an American , not as a candidate for president , " he said .
" But if I think I can do some good , I 'll do it .
I may fail a first or second or third time , but we have to get this job done for America . "
McCain said now is the time for bipartisanship in order to push through the $ 700 billion proposal , which failed in the House of Representatives Monday .
" To state the obvious , we are in the greatest financial crisis of our lifetimes .
Congressional inaction has put every American and the entire economy at the gravest risk .
Yesterday , the country and the world looked to Washington for leadership , and Congress once again came up empty - handed , " he said .
" Bipartisanship is a tough thing ; never more so when you 're trying to take necessary but publicly unpopular action .
But inaction is not an option . "
Obama , speaking at a rally in Reno , Nevada , on Tuesday , issued a tough message to fellow lawmakers .
" To the Democrats and Republicans who opposed this plan yesterday , I say step up to the plate and do what 's right for this country , " he said .
" And to all Americans , I say this :
If and when I am president of the United States , this rescue plan will not be the end of what we do to strengthen this economy , it will only be the beginning .
" It is not a time for politics .
It is not a time for partisanship .
It is not a time to figure out how to take credit or where to lay blame .
It is not a time for politicians to concern themselves with the next election .
...
It is a time for all of us to concern ourselves with the future of the country we love .
This is a time for action , " he said .
Earlier Tuesday on CNN's American Morning , McCain said the rescue plan failed because people do n't think it will do anything for them .
" We have n't convinced people that this is a rescue effort not just for Wall Street but for Main Street America , " McCain said . " ...
We did n't do a good enough job . "
McCain said the proposal needs modifications , including an increase in federal deposit insurance for private bank accounts .
" FDIC insurance should be increased to $ 250,000 from $ 100,000 , " McCain said .
Watch McCain lay out his proposal »
Obama made the same proposal on Tuesday morning as a way to persuade lawmakers who voted against the proposed $ 700 billion bailout to change their minds .
Watch the candidates regroup »
Increasing deposit insurance coverage " would boost small businesses , make our banking system more secure and help restore public confidence in our financial system , " Obama said in a written statement .
McCain , who briefly suspended his campaign last week to focus on the financial crisis , did not say whether he would take that action again .
" I will do whatever is necessary , " he told CNN .
McCain said he spoke to President Bush on Tuesday morning to offer his recommendations for a short - term plan " to restore our economy , " including using $ 250 billion of the Treasury Department 's exchange stability fund to " shore up our institutions . "
Watch Bush urge Congress to act »
McCain said the Treasury Department should also use its power to purchase up to $ 1 trillion of mortgages .
Obama also spoke with Bush on Tuesday morning .
" Both calls [ from McCain and Obama ] were very constructive , and the president appreciated hearing from them , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto said .
" The senators offered ideas and reaffirmed what they have said publicly -- that this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed .
" We 're not going to comment on specific ideas , but we appreciate hearing them and will continue to work with congressional leaders on ideas that will help the economy , " Fratto said .
Obama blasted Congress Monday for not passing the rescue package , while McCain 's campaign accused Obama and Democrats of putting " politics ahead of country . "
Watch what went wrong »
The U.S. House rejected the plan Monday , putting a roadblock in front of what would be the largest government intervention in the financial markets since the Great Depression .
The bill failed by a vote of 228-205 , with 140 Democrats and 65 Republicans voting in favor and 95 Democrats joining 133 Republicans against .
" This is a moment of national crisis , and today 's inaction in Congress as well as the angry and hyper - partisan statement released by the McCain campaign are exactly why the American people are disgusted with Washington , " the Obama - Biden campaign said in a statement released shortly after the vote .
The statement went on to say that every American " should be outraged that an era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and Washington has led us to this point . "
Watch more on the vote »
Also after the vote , McCain touted his role in last week 's negotiations on the bailout bill .
" I laid out principles " including " responsible oversight , transparency and a cap on so - called golden parachutes , those big bonuses Wall Street CEOs would receive despite their involvement in the economic crisis , " he said .
" I worked hard to play a constructive role . "
Watch McCain slam Obama on spending »
The economy has dominated the campaign trail this month , and both candidates have been trying to convince voters that they will do a better job of getting the financial crisis under control .

Meanwhile , as McCain and Obama continue campaigning this week , their running mates are focused on their upcoming debate .
Gov. Sarah Palin and Sen. Joe Biden face off Thursday in St. Louis , Missouri , in the only vice presidential debate of the election season .
After McCain 's rally , Palin headed to McCain 's ranch near Sedona , Arizona , for what a top aide calls " debate camp . "
Biden was preparing for the debate in Delaware on Monday .
The Senate 's vote on the bill is scheduled for after sundown , in observance of Rosh Hashana , the Jewish holiday .
CNN 's Jessica Yellin , Ted Barrett , Dana Bash , Alexander Marquardt and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .

Yes , I do realize that today 's post has a big ole ' photograph employing a hackneyed spoof of MasterCard 's " Priceless " campaign .
But bare with it ; the accompanying story from Zack makes it worthwhile ...
I work for a company that has recently started to grow in the technology realm .
One of the growing pains we 're having is our Network Administrator .
Being the CEO 's son - in - law , you 'd think he'd be more than qualified for the job .
But as it turns out , there 's a slight qualifications gap .
Among many other things , he ordered a new $ 2,000 laptop because the network card was " broken . "
I easily fixed it by installing the drivers .
But it was a recent trip to the server room that really took the cake .
Our network admin was out " training " for the week and we needed to go in and make a few configuration changes .
Our server rack houses about $ 20,000 worth of new equipment and has a free standing A/C unit on the counter to keep it cool .
Like similar A/C units , it has a spot on the back for a hose attachment to drain water from .
When we walked into the server room we nearly tripped on a giant puddle of water on the floor .
But that was n't the kicker ; our admin had set up the A/C unit to drain directly on the counter and had put a small fishbowl beneath the counter to catch the counter - overspill .
Since no one was doing the " regular maintenance " of emptying the fishbowl , it filled up and commenced spilling onto the floor .
We can only hope the " training " our network admin is at this week involves some sort of server room design cram session .
Or , really , anything would be good .
Please , just let it be something !
Oil prices dropped below $ 70 a barrel for the first time in 14 months Thursday , prompting the OPEC cartel to call for an emergency meeting next week to establish some stability in prices that have plummeted recently after rising for months .
While prices revived slightly early on Friday , oil prices have tumbled by nearly $ 40 a barrel in just three weeks as indications grow that demand for energy will slow along with weakening economies around the world .
As recently as July , oil was trading at a record of $ 145 a barrel .
On Friday , crude oil for November delivery traded at around $ 73 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , according to news reports .
The decline in oil prices could provide a form of stimulus to the economy as consumers pay less to fill up their tanks .
If oil prices stay at current levels , consumers would have $ 250 billion more , over a year , to save or spend elsewhere , according to Lawrence Goldstein , an energy economist .
Some analysts expect oil prices to keep declining , perhaps to as low as $ 50 a barrel in coming months .
Americans will probably see lower energy bills this winter , as gasoline and heating oil futures also dropped sharply on Thursday .
Gasoline prices now average $ 3.08 a gallon , down from a summer peak of $ 4.11 a gallon , according to AAA .
Schäubles Scheinargumente Michael Lohmann
Teil 1 : Wie der Bundesinnenminister das Thema Bürgerrechte umgeht und was ihn wirklich interessiert
Bundesinnenminister Wolfgang Schäuble gilt als eloquenter Redner , manche halten ihn gar für einen Intellektuellen .
Selbst Gegner Schäubles zollen ihm als politischem Schwergewicht Respekt .
In der Tat gelingt es dem Bundesinnenminister durchaus , mit geschliffenen Worten den Eindruck zu erwecken , seine Politik sei das Ergebnis langer und reiflicher Überlegung .
Doch wer genau hinschaut , erkennt , dass Schäuble vor allem so tut , als würde er argumentieren .
Schäubles Argumente halten einer gründlichen Prüfung kaum Stand .
Aber die Aufdeckung dieser Tatsache enttarnt den Innenminister nicht als Möchtegern - Intellektuellen .
Es geht mir nicht darum , Schäuble als „ Schauspieler “ bloßzustellen .
Vielmehr wird erkennbar , dass die Fassade des gepflegten akademischen Diskurses politischen Zielen dient .
So verschleiert der Anschein des Argumentierens , dass das Thema der Bürgerrechte Schäuble gar nicht interessiert .
Seine Argumentation blendet jedenfalls die wichtige Frage , wie viel Schutz dem Bürger vor der Staatsgewalt zusteht , komplett aus .
Das bedeutet aber auch , dass der Minister in seinem Vortrag nur so tut , als würde er sich mit der Kritik an seiner Sicherheitspolitik auseinandersetzen .
Ihm liegt also daran , dass seine Vermeidung des Themas Bürgerrechte nicht offenkundig wird .
In seinem in der ZEIT veröffentlichten Vortrag vor der Justizpressekonferenz in Karlsruhe betont Schäuble mehrfach sein Interesse daran , das Handeln der Polizei gesetzlich eindeutig regeln zu wollen , um rechtliche Grauzonen zu vermeiden .
Das klingt wie eine Konzession an die Kritiker einer Aufweichung des Rechtsstaates .
Er gibt sich damit als einer , der seine Entscheidungen nicht leichtfertig trifft und der die Sorgen der Kritiker ernst nimmt .
Die Antworten des Innenministers darauf sind aber eine Mogelpackung , denn sie kaschieren Schäubles tatsächliches Interesse an der Erweiterung der Handlungsspielräume der Sicherheitsorgane .
Auch in diesem Fall ist Schäuble erkennbar bemüht , die Karten nicht auf den Tisch zu legen .
Im Folgenden möchte ich diese
These belegen .
Dazu werde ich einige bemerkenswerte Aussagen des Bundesinnenministers genauer prüfen .
Meine Analyse stützt sich in der Hauptsache auf den genannten Vortrag .
Es ist ein Text , der am ehesten zu Schäubles Image als Intellektueller passt .
Als Vortrag ist er ein langfristig vorbereiteter und damit durchdachter Text .
Das Publikum ist ein akademisch geschultes Fachpublikum ( Juristen ) und deshalb anspruchsvoller als Festszeltbesucher , die vor allem durch politische Kampfrhetorik unterhalten werden wollen .
Daher kann man annehmen , dass Schäuble und sein Redenschreiber sich alle erdenkliche Mühe gegeben haben , um vor diesem Publikum überzeugend aufzutreten .
Weil die Zuhörerschaft keine einschlägige Parteizugehörigkeit aufweist , muss Schäuble möglichst parteipolitisch neutral versuchen , seinen Standpunkt plausibel zu machen .
Folgerichtig gibt sich Schäuble in seinem Vortrag den Anschein der Wissenschaftlichkeit .
Hinter dieser Fassade lässt sich dennoch der Politiker Schäuble entdecken .
Das versuche ich im Folgenden zu zeigen .
1. Die Vermeidung des Themas Bürgerrechte
Wolfgang Schäubles Vortrag ist ein Beitrag zur Diskussion um Sicherheitspolitik und Bürgerrechte .
Allerdings zeigt sich , dass Schäuble das Thema Bürgerrechte eigentlich nicht behandelt .
Zwischen den Zeilen wird deutlich , dass er dieses Thema in Wahrheit vermeidet , während er an der Oberfläche so tut , als würde es ihn gedanklich sehr beschäftigen .
Um diese
These zu belegen , möchte ich Schäubles Positionen zum Datenschutz untersuchen , die beispielhaft die Haltung des Innenministers enthüllen .
1.1 Schäubles falsches Verständnis vom Datenschutz
Auf dem ersten Blick betont Schäuble die Notwendigkeit des Datenschutzes :
Niemand bestreitet die Aktualität des Datenschutzes .
Wir dürfen die datenschutzrechtlichen Belange nicht beiseite schieben – was der Staat des Grundgesetzes auch nie getan hat .
Schäuble behauptet also , dass der Datenschutz ein wichtiges Anliegen des von ihm vertretenen Staates ist .
Er erkennt an , dass man sich mit diesem Thema befassen muss .
Der Eindruck entsteht , dass der Innenminister die Sorge um den Datenschutz ernst nimmt .
Der von Kritikern geäußerte Verdacht , Schäubles Sicherheitspolitik sei von einem antidemokratischen Affekt motiviert , findet hier zunächst keine Bestätigung und wirkt eher wie eine böswillige Unterstellung .
Doch dieser schöne Schein hält nicht lange vor .
Einige Zeilen später findet sich eine Äußerung Schäubles , die sein tatsächliches Verständnis vom Datenschutz offenbart .
Dieses weicht erheblich von dem der Datenschützer ab :
Datenschutz bedeutet nicht , dass der Staat wegschauen muss , wenn es um die Vorbereitung schwerster Straftaten geht .
Datenschutz bedeutet , dass der Gesetzgeber transparente Grundlagen dafür schafft , wer welche Daten wofür erhebt , welche Daten vernetzt werden können , wie lange sie gespeichert werden – das heißt : klare rechtliche Regelungen und richterliche Kontrolle , aber kein bewusster Verzicht auf Informationen , die notwendig sind , um den staatlichen Sicherheitsauftrag wahrnehmen zu können .
( Hervorhebungen von mir , M.L. )
Schäuble bestimmt den Datenschutz zunächst vorrangig als ein juristisches Problem .
Datenschutz ist etwas , was gesetzlich genau geregelt werden muss .
Diese gesetzliche Regelung bezieht sich auf Kompetenzen sowie auf die Art und Umfang der in Frage kommenden Daten .
Schäuble strebt an , genau festzulegen , welche Personen zur Datenerhebung befugt sind .
Genauso unstrittig geklärt sein muss die Art der Daten und deren Verwendungszweck .
Auf diese Weise wird zugleich bestimmt , welche Daten nicht erhoben werden dürfen , welche Zwecke illegitim sind und welche Personen keinen Zugang zu ihnen haben .
Gerade dieser strikte Ausschluss von unzulässigen Daten , Zwecken und unbefugten Personen wirkt auf den ersten Blick vielleicht beruhigend .
Nicht jeder darf alles , es gibt immer noch Grenzen für das Treiben der Staatsorgane .
Grenzverletzungen werden sanktioniert , man kann dagegen klagen und sie skandalisieren .
Die von Schäuble angemahnte „ Transparenz “ sorgt dafür , dass alle wissen , wer was darf und wer nicht .
„ Klare rechtliche Regelungen “ lassen weniger Missverständnisse bei der Auslegung der Gesetze zu und vermindern so das Risiko eigenmächtigen Handelns der Staatsorgane .
Mit der „ richterlichen Kontrolle “ scheint sich Schäuble zudem der populären Forderung nach einem Richtervorbehalt anzuschließen .
Der Richter als neutrale dritte Partei sorgt für eine Überprüfung der Gesetzestreue staatlicher Eingriffe und schafft damit Vertrauen in die Rechtsstaatlichkeit der Sicherheitspolitik .
Die für Diktaturen typische Willkür scheint auf diese Weise ausgeschlossen .
Bei genauerem Hinsehen fällt aber auf , dass diese Betonung klarer gesetzlicher Regelungen eine Scheinlösung ist .
Die Tatsache allein , dass das Handeln des Staates Gesetzen folgt , genügt noch nicht , um den Bürger vor der staatlichen Gewalt zu schützen .
Es kommt nämlich auf den I nhalt der Gesetze an .
So könnte es ja gesetzlich auch erlaubt sein , Verdächtige in Notlagen zu foltern ( dass dies nicht völlig aus der Luft gegriffen ist , hat die deutsche Debatte um die Zulässigkeit von Folter gezeigt ) .
In so einem Fall kann der Bürger sich nie sicher sein , dass er vor Folter geschützt ist .
Justizirrtümer oder ungerechtfertigte Verdächte , die aus tragischen Verkettungen von Umständen heraus entstehen , sind nie auszuschließen .
Gegen die erlittene Folter kann das Opfer hinterher auch nicht vorgehen , weil sie ja ein legales Mittel der Polizeiarbeit wäre .
Wenn die Folter gesetzlich legalisiert ist , ist der Bürger also potenziell durch die staatliche Übermacht bedroht .
Sicherheit und Vertrauen kann daher nicht allein durch die Tatsache der gesetzlichen Regelung geschaffen werden .
Diese Formfrage muss dringend ergänzt werden durch eine konkrete inhaltliche Bestimmung , was der Staat darf und was nicht ( Um im obigen Beispiel zu bleiben : Man müsste auch ein definitives Folterverbot festschreiben . ) .
Datenschutz beschränkt sich nicht auf den Umstand , dass er gesetzlich geregelt ist .
Zum Datenschutz gehören auch grundsätzliche Überlegungen , wie das Verhältnis zwischen Staat und Bürgern gestaltet sein soll .
Die Frage ist hier , welche Rechte Bürger eigentlich besitzen sollen und welche Rolle der Staat zu spielen hat .
Hierzu muss jeder Diskutant eine prinzipielle Position entwickeln .
Üblicherweise wird in der Bundesrepublik die individuelle Freiheit des Einzelnen als Leitwert propagiert , auch von der CDU , der Schäuble angehört .
Ausgehend von diesem
Wert muss eine Datenschutzdebatte die Folgen staatlicher Eingriffe für diese Freiheit reflektieren und bewerten .
Man muss dann auch genau für den konkreten Fall bestimmen , wann Freiheit unzulässig eingeschränkt wird und wo im Einzelfall Grenzen zu ziehen sind .
Genauso am Einzelfall muss diskutiert werden , wo eventuelle Einschränkungen des Datenschutzes in Abwägung mit anderen Gütern ( z.B. des Schutzes vor tödlichen Anschlägen ) vielleicht hinnehmbar wären .
Schäuble bleibt in seiner Bestimmung des Datenschutzes jedoch auf der formalen juristischen Ebene stehen .
Er verwendet im Grunde eine Worthülse , wenn er von Datenschutz redet .
Sein Verständnis von Datenschutz taugt allenfalls zur Auflösung juristischer Grauzonen .
Damit wird Ordnung geschaffen , aber Ordnung ist nicht per se ein Wert .
Schließlich haben auch undemokratische Regime eine Ordnung .
Ordnung ist lediglich ein Beschreibungsbegriff , sie ist einer von mehreren Zuständen , die ein System einnehmen kann .
Ordnung wird nur dann zum Wert , wenn sie bestimmte Probleme löst und wenn dieses Problem durch Unordnung erzeugt wird .
Dafür muss man aber auch genau sagen , welches Problem man mit der durch gesetzliche Klarheit geschaffenen Ordnung denn lösen möchte ( dazu mehr im Kapitel 2 ) .
1.2 Schäubles Priorität für die Handlungsfähigkeit des Staates
Dass Schäuble hier auf eine konkrete Benennung des Datenschutzproblems verzichtet , lässt sich durch zwei Vermutungen verschieden erklären : a ) Schäuble ist im Grunde naiv bzw .
zu sehr in der Juristensicht verhaftet und erkennt daher das eigentliche Problem nicht .
b)
Schäuble vermeidet es mit Absicht , auf das Datenschutzproblem als solches einzugehen .
Ich neige beim Lesen von Schäubles Vortrag zur Hypothese b ) .
Dazu ein weiteres Zitat :
Deswegen ist mein Verständnis von Datenschutz nicht , dass sich der Staat selbst blind und dumm macht .
( Hervorhebungen von mir , M.L. )
Hier beschreibt der Innenminister , wie er sich Datenschutz vorstellt .
Damit räumt er ein , dass man verschiedene Vorstellungen von Datenschutz haben kann und dass es daher geboten ist , die eigene Position zu verdeutlichen .
Zugleich muss man sich von anderen Vorstellungen abgrenzen .
Wie bereits oben diskutiert , fehlt bei Schäuble ein Bezug von „ Datenschutz “ auf das Verhältnis von Staat und Bürger .
Sichtbar wird dagegen , dass für den Minister vor allem der Staat ein Thema ist .
Es gibt – so kann man Schäuble hier übersetzen – Vorstellungen von Datenschutz , die die Handlungsfähigkeit des Staates beeinträchtigen bzw .
die diesen zwingen , sich selbst zu beschränken .
Dabei ist Schäuble nicht so unklug , um jegliche staatliche Selbstbeschränkung bereits als Problem zu beschreiben .
Er weiß , dass der demokratische Rechtsstaat immer Beschränkungen unterliegt .
Es geht ihm stattdessen um sehr gravierende Einschnitte in die Handlungsfähigkeit .
Das zeigen die Worte „ blind “ und „ dumm “ .
Eine nähere Betrachtung dieser Metaphern lohnt sich .
Blindheit wird gemeinhin als eine Behinderung angesehen .
Selbst wenn man hier politisch korrekter von „ Herausforderungen “ sprechen will , gesteht man doch zu , dass Blindheit das Leben erschwert .
Dies gilt besonders für den Fall des Erblindens , in dem der vormals Sehende nun lernen muss , den Ausfall eines seiner Sinne zu kompensieren .
Handlungen , die früher routinemäßig erledigt worden sind ( z.B. der Gang in den Supermarkt ) , werden nun zu einem beschwerlichen Abenteuer .
Man muss jetzt viel mehr Zeit und Mühe aufwenden , um die früher leicht gewonnenen Handlungserfolge zu erzielen .
Diese Überlegungen kann man auf Schäubles Datenschutzverständnis übertragen .
Falsch verstandener Datenschutz sorgt nach Schäubles Sicht dafür , dass der Staat sich selber blind machen muss .
Damit beraube sich der Staat einer wichtigen Fähigkeit , die ihm zuvor natürlicher Weise gegeben war , so wie der Sehsinn der Mehrheit der Menschen als natürliche Fähigkeit zur Verfügung steht .
Also hat der Staat in Folge eines solchen Datenschutzverständnisses schon Mühe mit Routineaktionen .
Deshalb ist der Staat in seiner Handlungsfähigkeit massiv eingeschränkt .
1.3 Infragestellung der Idee des Datenschutzes
Um das Sehvermögen und um die Handlungsfähigkeit des Staates ging es auch in dem eingangs besprochenen Zitat :
Datenschutz bedeutet nicht , dass der Staat wegschauen muss , wenn es um die Vorbereitung schwerster Straftaten geht .
( Hervorhebungen von mir , M.L. )
In zwei Hinsichten wird nun deutlich , inwiefern Schäuble in diesem und dem oben besprochenen Zitat das eigentliche Thema Datenschutz vermeidet , wenn nicht gar ignoriert .
Erstens benutzt er mit den Worten „ blind “ und „ dumm “ Metaphern , die bei Lichte besehen subjektiv und nichtssagend sind .
Der geneigte Leser des Schäublevortrages erfährt nichts darüber , welche Handlungsprobleme den Sicherheitsorganen durch konkrete Datenschutzregelungen entstehen .
Er muss sich mit der Behauptung zufrieden geben , dass Datenschutz gravierende Handlungsprobleme erzeugt .
Schäuble bietet seinem Publikum keine nachvollziehbaren Zusammenhänge zwischen Datenschutz und Handlungsfähigkeit des Staates an , weil er durch den Gebrauch der Metaphern konkrete Fallanalysen vermeidet .
Der Leser kann die Behauptung Schäubles daher nicht nachvollziehen und für sich prüfen , ob sie plausibel ist .
Er kann dem Innenminister lediglich glauben .
Schäuble selbst scheint sich auf die Suggestivkraft seiner Metaphorik zu verlassen und sieht offenbar keinerlei Notwendigkeit , seine Behauptungen auch durch Argumente zu begründen .
Eine echte Diskussion des Datenschutzthemas kann auf dieser Grundlage aber nicht geführt werden .
Oder besser : Schäuble bzw .
sein Redenschreiber , der diesen Vortrag vorbereitet hat , geht dieser Diskussion schlicht aus dem Weg .
Zweitens ist das für Schäuble wesentliche Kriterium eines richtigen oder falschen Datenschutzverständnisses vor allem die Handlungsfähigkeit des Staates .
Datenschutz wird von Schäuble offenbar sehr funktional verstanden .
Datenschutz ist nur dann gut , wenn er die Handlungsfähigkeit des Staates nicht beeinträchtigt .
Das Vermögen des Staates zur Verbrechensbekämpfung bzw .
- prävention hat absolute Priorität .
Diese Prioritätensetzung schließt es aus , Datenschutz vorrangig als Frage nach der Privatsphäre und der informationellen Selbstbestimmung des Bürgers zu stellen .
Letzteres ist für Schäuble offenbar kein
Wert per se und nur solange akzeptabel , wie der Staat dennoch nach seinem Dafürhalten agieren kann .
Diese Prioritätensetzung Schäubles ist aber im Grunde eine radikale Infragestellung der Idee des Datenschutzes .
Für die öffentliche Debatte folgt daraus , dass der Innenminister bei diesem Thema gestellt werden muss , indem seine Scheinargumente offen dekonstruiert werden .
Schäuble muss gezwungen werden , seine Lippenbekenntnisse bezüglich der Bürgerrechte aufzugeben und die Diskussion anhand konkreter Fälle und auf der Basis klarer Bestimmungen von Bürgerrechten zu führen ( Dieser Gedanke stützt sich auch maßgeblich auf Peter Monnerjahn , der einerseits danach fragt , inwiefern sicherheitspolitische Vorschläge bestehenden Rechtsgrundsätzen entsprechen und andererseits danach , welche konkreten Probleme diese Vorschläge lösen sollen ( Zu kurz gedacht : Schäuble und seine Kritiker ) .
2. Schäubles tatsächliches Ziel : Die Erweiterung des Handlungsspielraumes der Polizei
Nachdem ich gezeigt habe , dass es Schäuble nicht wirklich um die Bürgerrechte geht , will ich nun sein tatsächliches Interesse offenlegen :
Es ist die Erweiterung des Handlungsspielraumes der Polizei .
Diese
These ist für „ geübte “ Kritiker sicher wenig überraschend .
Es geht mir jedoch nicht um Originalität .
Wichtig ist mir die Aufdeckung der rhetorischen Tricks , mit denen Schäuble diese vermutlich als unpopulär befürchtete Haltung kaschiert .
Zugleich hoffe ich , mit dieser Analyse die Argumente der Kritik zu schärfen .
2.1 Was ist das Problem des übergesetzlichen Notstandes ?
Für die Beantwortung der Frage nach dem tatsächlichen Interesse des Innenministers greife ich auf eine andere Quelle zurück .
In einem öffentlich vieldiskutierten Interview vom 19 .
Juli 2007 gibt es eine bemerkenswerte Passage :
SPIEGEL : Die Bundesregierung würde wahrscheinlich erst einen Staatsanwalt losschicken , um Bin Laden festzunehmen ...
Schäuble : ... und die Amerikaner würden ihn mit einer Rakete exekutieren , und die meisten Leute würden sagen : Gott sei Dank .
Aber seien wir ehrlich : Die Rechtsfragen dabei wären völlig ungeklärt , vor allem , wenn daran Deutsche beteiligt wären .
Wir sollten versuchen , solche Fragen möglichst präzise verfassungsrechtlich zu klären , und Rechtsgrundlagen schaffen , die uns die nötigen Freiheiten im Kampf gegen den Terrorismus bieten .
Ich halte nichts davon , sich auf einen übergesetzlichen Notstand zu berufen , nach dem Motto : „ Not kennt kein Gebot . “ ( Hervorhebungen von mir , M.L. )
Diese Worte haben in der Öffentlichkeit für Aufregung gesorgt .
Man warf Schäuble vor , das gezielte Töten legalisieren zu wollen .
Doch darum soll es hier nicht gehen .
Interessant ist für mich die Ablehnung des übergesetzlichen Notstandes .
Dies ist ein geschickter rhetorischer Schachzug .
Man mag dem Innenminister gewagte Gedankenspiele bezüglich der Tötung Bin Ladens vorhalten .
Aber mit der Ablehnung eines übergesetzlichen , also ungeregelten Notstandes kann Schäuble darauf pochen , immer noch ein klarer Verfechter des Rechtsstaatsprinzips zu sein .
Schließlich hält selbst er , der nach eigenem Bekunden gerne auch unkonventionelle Gedanken hegt , den übergesetzlichen Notstand für ein Problem .
Doch worin besteht dieses eigentlich ?
Als der Verteidigungsminister Jung das Abschießen von entführten Flugzeugen durch einen übergesetzlichen Notstand rechtfertigen wollte , war die Empörung groß .
Die Armeeführung würde nach den Vorstellungen des Verteidigungsministers in einem solchen Notfall die Rechtslage außer Kraft setzen und allein nach eigenem Ermessen handeln .
So wären die Flugpassagiere der Gewalt der Armee schutzlos ausgeliefert .
Deshalb ist der übergesetzliche Notstand ein Problem : Er öffnet der willkürlichen Gewaltanwendung Tür und Tor .
Nur der klare gesetzliche Ausschluss solcher Rechtfertigungsstrategien kann den Bürger halbwegs vor diesem Risiko schützen .
Deshalb fordert Schäuble folgerichtig , dass das Handeln der Sicherheitsorgane auch in Notsituationen genau gesetzlich definiert werden muss .
Die öffentliche Empörung hat aber ein zweites Problem des übergesetzlichen Notstandes verdeckt .
Dieser Notstand schafft erhebliche Unsicherheit für die Staatsorgane , die sich hinterher für ihre Aktion im Notfall rechtfertigen müssen .
Was für die Kritiker der Pläne Jungs als Willkür erscheint , ist mitunter für einen Polizisten ein Zwang , nun selber eine Entscheidung treffen zu müssen .
Denn wenn die
Not so groß ist , dass die Gesetze außer Kraft gesetzt werden müssen , dann entfallen auch die bewährten durch das Gesetz vorgeschriebenen Mittel der Problemlösung , die man routinemäßig anwenden kann .
Aber wo die Vorlagen für den „ Dienst nach Vorschrift “ wegfallen , weiß man nie , ob man wirklich die richtige Entscheidung getroffen hat .
Dieses Problem kann sich verschärfen , sobald die Gesetze wieder in Kraft treten .
Schließlich ist der übergesetzliche Notstand kein Dauerzustand , sondern ein absoluter Ausnahmefall .
Wenn nun die Opfer seines Handelns den Polizisten verklagen , besteht für diesen die Gefahr , sich vor Gericht verantworten zu müssen .
Der Polizist wird sich in seiner Verteidigung auf seine Einschätzung berufen , dass ein Notfall vorgelegen habe .
Aber es bleibt unsicher , ob das Gericht diese Situationseinschätzung sowie die daraus gezogenen Konsequenzen für richtig hält .
Der Polizist kommt dadurch in eine unangenehme Situation .
Er muss sich einem Prozess mit ungewissem Ausgang beugen und befürchten , bestraft zu werden , obwohl er nur seinen Dienst versehen hat .
Auch dieses Problem kann gelöst werden durch eine klare gesetzliche Regelung , die den übergesetzlichen Notstand ausschließt und die bestimmte Handlungsweisen der Polizei in Notlagen vorsieht .
Klare gesetzliche Regelungen schützen den Polizisten davor , für sein Handeln später verurteilt zu werden .
Sie geben dem Polizisten Orientierung , was er machen darf und was nicht .
Er hat dank dieser Gesetze auch die Gewissheit , dass sein Handeln durch den Staat gedeckt und vertreten wird .
Der Polizist agiert damit als der Vertreter des Staates , welcher ihn bei seiner Amtsausübung unterstützt und ihn im Falle von Klagen auch zur Seite steht .
Damit wird deutlich , dass Schäubles Plädoyer für rechtliche Klärung keineswegs eindeutig ist .
Sowohl der Bürger kann von rechtlichen Bestimmungen profitieren als auch die Polizei .
Der Nutzen des Bürgers und der Nutzen des Polizisten sind dabei keineswegs die zwei Seiten der selben Medaille , denn das Gesetz kann auch Handlungen rechtfertigen , die für den davon betroffenen Bürger höchst bedrohlich sind .
Das Beispiel der Debatte um die Erlaubnis von Folter hatte ich ja schon erwähnt .
Deshalb müsste Schäuble seine Position erheblich präzisieren , um klarzustellen , wessen Interessen genau er im Auge hat , wenn er von einer rechtlichen Klärung spricht .
2.2 Worum sich Schäuble wirklich sorgt : Rechtssicherheit und Spielräume für die Polizei
Ich behaupte , dass Schäuble es vor allem um die Rechtssicherheit der Polizei geht , während ihn der Schutz der Bürger weniger bis gar nicht interessiert .
Diese
These lässt sich durch genauere Betrachtung des SPIEGEL - Zitates plausibel machen .
Dazu noch einmal ein Ausschnitt aus der besprochenen Passage :
Wir sollten versuchen , solche Fragen möglichst präzise verfassungsrechtlich zu klären , und Rechtsgrundlagen schaffen , die uns die nötigen Freiheiten im Kampf gegen den Terrorismus bieten .
( Hervorhebungen von mir , M.L. )
Ein erstes Indiz für meine Behauptung ergibt sich aus der Begründung , warum man Rechtsklarheit schaffen müsse .
Schäuble begründet den Ausschluss des übergesetzlichen Notstandes nicht mit der Schutzbedürftigkeit des Bürgers .
Für ihn ist die Rechtsklarheit geboten , um die besagten „ nötigen Freiheiten “ zu schaffen .
Diese Freiheiten stellen aber nicht nur eine zusätzliche Möglichkeit dar .
Sie sind nach Schäubles Worten nötig , um den Kampf gegen den Terrorismus führen zu können .
Behauptet wird also , dass der Antiterrorkampf nur erfolgreich sein kann , wenn diese Freiheiten , als notwendige Bedingung geschaffen werden .
Das bedeutet , dass Schäubles Ablehnung des übergesetzlichen Notstandes vor allem den Handlungserfordernissen geschuldet sind , die die Abwehr des Terrors mit sich bringt .
Hier zeigt sich wieder , dass das Thema der Bürgerrechte eigentlich wenig Gewicht für den Innenminister hat .
Zumindest erscheinen ihm die Bürgerrechte nicht als eigenständiger und hinreichender Grund , um einen übergesetzlichen Notstand abzulehnen .
Ein zweites Indiz : Es geht um Freiheiten , die durch die rechtliche Klärung entstehen sollen .
Die Vermeidung des übergesetzlichen Notstandes durch die Schaffung von Rechtsgrundlagen sorgt also nicht in erster Linie für Einschränkungen , sondern schafft Freiheiten .
Jetzt stellt sich die Frage , wessen Freiheit hier gemeint ist : die des Bürgers oder die des Staates ?
Ist die Rede von der Freiheit des Bürgers , sind die negativen Freiheitsrechte gemeint .
Diese beschreiben , vor welchen denkbaren staatlichen Aktivitäten der Bürger geschützt ist .
Also meinen sie eigentlich eine Einschränkung der Handlungsmöglichkeiten des Staates .
Können diese beschränkten Handlungsmöglichkeiten des Staates aber gemeint sein , wenn es um die von Schäuble benannten unverzichtbaren Freiheiten im Antiterrorkampf geht ?
Dieser Fall erforderte eine abstrakte Philosophie , die diese Selbstbeschränkung des Staates zu einem wirksamen Instrument im Antiterrorkampf umdeuten könnte .
Schäuble ist jedoch nicht dafür bekannt , die bislang bestehenden westlichen Freiheiten als wirksamstes Anti-Terror - Instrument zu preisen .
Deshalb liegt es näher , dass es Schäuble vor allem um eine reale Freiheit des Staates geht , damit dieser gegen den Terrorismus nach Gutdünken vorgehen kann .
2.3 Wer wirklich von den „ nötigen Freiheiten “ im Antiterrorkampf profitiert
Ein drittes Indiz unterstützt diese Lesart .
In dem Zitat wird ein Kollektiv als Akteur angedeutet .
Sowohl die von Schäuble angemahnte Rechtsklärung als auch der Kampf gegen den Terror ist Aufgabe eines schlicht mit „ wir “ bzw .
mit „ uns “ benannten Kollektivs .
Ganz gleich , ob man unter diesem „ wir “ die gesamte deutsche Gesellschaft oder eben nur die Staatsorgane versteht , in jedem Fall wird erkennbar , dass die Nutznießer der Freiheiten die Staatsorgane sind .
Um das zu belegen , wähle ich zunächst die großzügigste und unvoreingenommenste Deutung , die Übersetzung des „ wir “ als Bezeichnung für die gesamte deutsche Gesellschaft .
Die gesamte Gesellschaft umfasst jeden Menschen , der in Deutschland lebt .
Die rechtliche Klärung und den Ausschluss übergesetzlicher Notstände wäre dann eine Verpflichtung für jeden Bürger .
Die laut Schäuble dadurch gewonnenen Freiheiten kämen aber auch allen gleichermaßen zugute .
Aus dieser Sicht erschiene Schäuble lediglich der Repräsentant und Diener eines übergeordneten Volkswillens , weshalb es falsch wäre , ihm egoistische oder bürgerfeindliche Interessen zu unterstellen .
Jedoch lässt sich diese Sichtweise nicht aufrechterhalten , denn ein so verstandenes „ wir “ wäre vor allem Pathos und keine reale Beschreibung der Gesellschaft .
Das wird deutlich , wenn man danach fragt , wer von den neu zu schaffenden Freiheiten wirklich konkret profitiert .
Nach Schäuble sind dies ja vor allem Freiheiten , die im Kampf gegen den Terror gebraucht werden .
Deshalb kommen diese Freiheiten nur jenen zugute , die diesen Kampf auch wirklich führen .
Dieser Kampf obliegt aber allein der Polizei und den Geheimdiensten .
Der zivile Bürger bleibt wegen des Gewaltmonopols des Staates gezwungenermaßen passiv .
Es ist ihm nicht erlaubt , in Eigeninitiative etwas zu unternehmen .
Folglich profitieren von den genannten Freiheiten tatsächlich die Behörden .
Nur für diese sind erweiterte Spielräume handlungsrelevant .
Der Bürger selbst kann diese Freiheiten nicht aktiv nutzen , er profitiert maximal indirekt von den Effekten dieser erweiterten Behördenspielräume , nämlich dann , wenn die Polizei durch neue Befugnisse spürbare Erfolge bei der Terrorbekämpfung erzielen kann .
In dem Pathos des „ wir “ gehen auch die realen Machtunterschiede in der Gesellschaft unter .
Neue Spielräume der Polizei können nämlich auch dem Bürger schaden , in dem sie seine Freiheit einschränken .
Denn jeder Bürger des Staates ist dessen Gesetzen unterworfen .
Diese Gesetzestreue kann der Staat durch den Einsatz von Gewaltmitteln erzwingen .
Diese Gewaltmittel sind ebenfalls gesetzlich festgeschrieben .
Gegen ihren Einsatz kann niemand erfolgreich Klage erheben , solange sich das Polizeihandeln auf dem Boden des Gesetzes bewegt .
Das heißt aber , dass man die als legal definierten Aktionen der Polizei schlicht hinnehmen muss .
Wenn ein Polizist von einem Autofahrer die Papiere verlangt , so muss dieser gehorchen , ganz gleich , ob ihm in dem Moment danach ist oder ob diese Demonstration staatlicher Autorität seinen Stolz verletzt .
Eine Weigerung des Autofahrers wäre bereits Widerstand gegen die Staatsgewalt und diese ist strafbar .
Es gibt also ein klares Machtgefälle in der Gesellschaft : Der Staatsgewalt muss sich jeder beugen , aber nicht jeder verfügt über die Gewaltmittel , um seinen Willen durchzusetzen .
Wo aber die einen etwas tun dürfen , gegen das sich die anderen nur eingeschränkt wehren können , löst sich die mit dem „ wir “ beschworene Gemeinschaft aller auf .
Man kann dagegen einwenden , dass die Polizei letztlich das Instrument der gesamten Gesellschaft ist .
Diese Sichtweise folgt ja dem demokratischen Pathos , dass jeder einzelne den Staat bildet und dieser eben nicht nur durch seine offiziellen Vertreter gebildet wird .
Für diese Sichtweise spricht die Annahme , dass die Abwehr tödlicher Terrorgefahren ganz sicher ein breit geteiltes Anliegen der Deutschen ist .
Folglich erscheint die Polizei lediglich als Vollstrecker des Mehrheitswillens .
So verstanden ist die Polizei lediglich Dienstleister und Auftragnehmer des gesamtgesellschaftlichen Willens .
Doch diese Sichtweise ändert nichts an dem tatsächlich bestehenden Machtgefälle zwischen Staat und Bürger .
In dem Moment , wo ein Bürger von Polizeimaßnahmen betroffen ist , nützt es ihm nichts , als Teil der idealisierten Gesellschaft eigentlich Auftraggeber der Polizei zu sein .
Er muss deren Treiben dennoch erdulden .
Der betroffene Bürger kann seinen Auftrag jetzt nicht mehr zurückziehen .
Er kann über die Polizei in keiner Weise verfügen und kann ihr nicht sagen , was sie zu tun und zu lassen hat .
Der von einer Polizeimaßnahme Betroffene findet auch wenig Trost in der Behauptung , dass die Bürger als Wähler einer bestimmten Innenpolitik indirekt der Polizei ihren Auftrag erteilen .
Diese Behauptung läuft darauf hinaus , dass die als unangenehm empfundene Maßnahme deshalb hinzunehmen ist , weil sie eigentlich dem eigenen Wunsch ( z.B. nach Sicherheit und Schutz ) entspricht .
Doch das trägt nicht immer .
Zwar stimmt es , dass die Bevölkerung durch Wahlen auf die Politik Einfluss nimmt .
Aber die Bevölkerung ist kein höheres Wesen mit einem eigenen Willen , der sich dann in einer Wahl befriedigt , sobald sich dieser Wille durchgesetzt hat .
Die Bevölkerung besteht stattdessen aus Einzelnen .
Diese müssen oft erleben , dass ihr Einzelwille keine Befriedigung finden kann , weil sie nicht die nötigen Machtmittel und - positionen haben oder keine Mehrheit für ihre Interessen mobilisieren können .
Das konkrete Polizeihandeln verwirklicht darum nicht in jedem Fall den Willen des Einzelnen und dieser hat im Grunde auch keine echten Möglichkeiten , die Polizei in seinem Sinne zu beeinflussen .
Fazit
Es zeigt sich also , dass auch die großzügige Lesart des „ wir “ als demokratische Pathos zu dem Ergebnis kommt , dass die Profiteure neuer Freiheiten im Antiterrorkampf allein die damit befassten Behörden wären .
Die Behauptung eines allgemeinen Nutzens , von dem alle profitieren , ist dagegen unrealistisch .
Vor diesem Hintergrund bleibt Schäubles Ablehnung des übergesetzlichen Notstandes suspekt .
Die rechtliche Klärung , die solche Notstände ausschließen soll , sorgt für Freiheiten , von denen ausschließlich die Behörden profitieren .
Hingegen wird die potenzielle Bedrohung des Bürgers durch Behördenmaßnahmen , die sich auf solche Notstände berufen , nicht diskutiert .
Damit signalisiert Schäuble ungewollt , dass seine Priorität auf der Erweiterung der Handlungsspielräume der Behörden liegt .

It 's hard not to think the new Honda Insight hybrid and the Toyota Prius look like kissing cousins .
But , while both are five - door hatches sharing similar profiles , cut lines and green - tinged halos ... they 've got vastly different designs .
Below the jump , we 've detailed seven of the literally tens of differences between the two happy hybrids .
And yes , we 're even including the big " H " on the front of the 2010 Honda Insight .
Advertisement
Difference # 1 : Instead of going with the stylized T , as on the Prius , the new Insight has a very defined H above the grille .
This is a difference of 11 letter positions in the alphabet and a sign that Honda is the true Maverick in this race .
Difference # 2 : The Toyota Prius is very noticeable from the rear because of its squarer clear taillights housing red LED lights .
The engineers from Honda have focused on a more angular look for their clear taillights with red LED lights .
Difference # 3 : Honda stepped out with some fairly trick split five - spoke wheels that look much hotter than the boring seven - spoke Prius design .
We 're not sure if these will make it from concept to reality .
Difference # 4 : The Prius has been faulted for its bland nose and utilitarian look , which Honda has countered with a more Honda CRZ - inspired front ; it 's more dramatic , modern and captivating in its vanilla quasi-Dave look .
The design makes the new Insight look like a more expensive car than the Prius .
Difference # 5 : Toyota engineers love boxes and Honda deviated wildly from this path by introducing a round fuel access cover .
That 's change you can not only believe in , but it 's change that signals the outside - the - box thinking you 've come to expect from Honda .
Difference # 6 : As opposed to headlights that wrap upwards from a sharply curving grille , the Insight 's lights curve outward from a sharply curving grille .
It 's so different — like apples and pears .
Difference # 7 : One of the features that differentiates the Prius from other cars on the road , visually , is that little window behind the A - pillar and ahead of the mirrors .
The low belt - line of both of these cars necessitates such a move but Honda hides it , using a cheater panel aft of the mirror and a supporting strip behind the mirror .
It 's a smart design change that 'll really help separate it from the crowd .
So there you have it — two totally different vehicles .
No matter what your eyes tell you .
Scientists have made a dramatic leap forward in the treatment of multiple sclerosis with the discovery of a drug that not only halts the disease but can also reverse it .
The discovery is being hailed as the biggest advance against the debilitating neurological condition for more than a decade and could prove effective against other , similar diseases .
The MS Society said it was " delighted " by the results .
Scientists believe the drug , alemtuzumab , may also be effective in other conditions .
Further studies are under way into its use in autoimmune conditions such as rhemumatoid arthritis , in which the immune system attacks itself , and in transplant surgery .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Alemtuzumab was developed 30 years ago by researchers at the University of Cambridge and is an established treatment for leukaemia .
It was the first monoclonal antibody – a type of immune system booster – given to humans and heralded a new era of powerful medical treatments .
Its creator , Cesar Milstein , was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1984 .
In the 1990s , Cambridge scientists began investigating it for multiple sclerosis but initial studies , carried out on patients with advanced disease , were disappointing .
Alasdair Coles , one of the researchers at the department of clinical neurosciences , said : " It was n't clear how safe the drug was so initially we gave it to patients with nothing to lose .
They continued to get progressive disability and that led us to the view that it needed to be given early on , before scarring and nerve death had occurred . "
The study involved a total of 334 patients in Europe and the US with early relapsing - remitting MS who were given the standard treatment of beta - interferon or one of two dose levels of alemtuzumab .
After three years , those taking alemutuzumab had 74 per cent fewer attacks and 71 per cent less disability compared with those taking beta-interferon .
Dr Coles said : " It is superlative – much better than the standard treatment . "
The drug is given by IV infusion over five days and then no further treatment is needed for more than a year .
The earliest patients in the study , who started treatment in 1999 , have had four cycles of treatment .
Dr Coles said that he was " confident " that the treatment would be effective for years but that further studies were under way to see how many cycles of treatment could be given .
The trial was almost abandoned in 2005 after three patients developed a dangerous condition leading to a low platelet count , affecting blood clotting , and one died of a brain haemorrhage .
About one in five patients also developed problems with thyroid function .
With careful monitoring , the researchers were able to spot and treat affected patients and the trial restarted in 2007 .
" Obviously [ the death ] was a disaster .
But we now have a plan for how to deal with affected patients and the plan has worked .
We have identified five other cases with low platelets , all of whom were treated and are well .
It means patients need a lot of monitoring , but all our patients say the hassle is worth it , " Dr Coles said .
The results are published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
The drug must now undergo another trial before it can be licensed .
Tony Johnstone : ' Alemtuzumab has been a life - saver '
Tony Johnstone , a professional golfer , was forced to give up competitive golf in 2003 , when he was diagnosed with MS .
But after treatment with alemtuzumab in 2005 , this year he won his first tournament since his diagnosis .
He said : " The Jersey Seniors Classic was the most important win of my life .
During my career , I had six wins on the European circuit and 22 wins on the US circuit .
But to be told you will never play again and then go on to a win like that in Jersey ; it 's the greatest achievement of my life . "
Now 52 , he lives in Sunningdale , Berkshire , with his wife , Karen , and two children .
For a year before he was diagnosed , he was struggling .
" One day , I could hardly walk ; it felt like someone had pulled the plug .
I was sent for an MRI scan and I got the diagnosis .
They said my career was over .
When you are fit and a sportsman and something like that comes out of the blue , it knocks you down . "
Then a specialist told him about the trial and he was one of the last patients accepted .
" Alemtuzumab has been a life - saver .
My co-ordination was worst affected .
I had two cycles of treatment a year apart and six months after the second treatment I started playing again .
It took me two years to relearn the game .
But I am out there playing when I could n't walk nine holes of golf before .
If I can give hope to other people affected like me I am overjoyed . "
I 've posted his major speeches in full for the past eighteen months .
His latest - given today in Toledo , Ohio - continues after the jump .
It gave me more confidence in our economic future :
The credit crisis has left businesses large and small unable to get loans , which means they can't buy new equipment , or hire new workers , or even make payroll for the workers they have .
You 've got auto plants right here in Ohio that have been around for decades closing their doors and laying off workers who 've never known another job in their entire life .
We meet at a moment of great uncertainty for America .
The economic crisis we face is the worst since the Great Depression .
Markets across the globe have become increasingly unstable , and millions of Americans will open up their 401 ( k ) statements this week and see that so much of their hard - earned savings have disappeared .
760,000 workers have lost their jobs this year .
Unemployment here in Ohio is up 85 % over the last eight years , which is the highest it 's been in sixteen years .
You 've lost one of every four manufacturing jobs , the typical Ohio family has seen their income fall $ 2,500 , and it 's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage , or fill up your gas tank , or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month .
At this rate , the question is n't just " are you better off than you were four years ago ? " , it 's " are you better off than you were four weeks ago ? "
I know these are difficult times .
I know folks are worried .
But I also know this - we can steer ourselves out of this crisis .
Because we are the United States of America .
We are the country that has faced down war and depression ; great challenges and great threats .
And at each and every moment , we have risen to meet these challenges - not as Democrats , not as Republicans , but as Americans .
We still have the most talented , most productive workers of any country on Earth .
We 're still home to innovation and technology , colleges and universities that are the envy of the world .
Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities .
It wo n't be easy , but there 's no reason we can't make this century another American century .
But it will take a new direction .
It will take new leadership in Washington .
It will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years .
And that 's why I 'm running for President of the United States of America .
My opponent has made his choice .
Last week , Senator McCain 's campaign announced that they were going to " turn the page " on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead .
His campaign actually said , and I quote , " if we keep talking about the economy , we 're going to lose . "
Well Senator McCain may be worried about losing an election , but I 'm worried about Americans who are losing their jobs , and their homes , and their life savings .
They can't afford four more years of the economic theory that says we should give more and more to millionaires and billionaires and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
We 've seen where that 's led us and we 're not going back .
It 's time to turn the page .
Over the course of this campaign , I 've laid out a set of policies that will grow our middle - class and strengthen our economy in the long - term .
I 'll reform our tax code so that 95 % of workers and their families get a tax cut , and eliminate income taxes for seniors making under $ 50,000 .
I 'll bring down the cost of health care for families and businesses by investing in preventative care , new technology , and giving every American the chance to get the same kind of health insurance that members of Congress give themselves .
We 'll ensure every child can compete in the global economy by recruiting an army of new teachers and making college affordable for anyone who wants to go .
We 'll create five million new , high - wage jobs by investing in the renewable sources of energy that will eliminate the oil we currently import from the Middle East in ten years , and we 'll create two million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads , schools , and bridges .
But that 's a long - term strategy for growth .
Right now , we face an immediate economic emergency that requires urgent action .
We can't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now - who do n't know if their job or their retirement will be there tomorrow ; who do n't know if next week 's paycheck will cover this month 's bills .
We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle - class and we need to do it now .
Today I 'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilize our financial system , provide relief to families and communities , and help struggling homeowners .
It 's a plan that begins with one word that 's on everyone 's mind , and it 's spelled J - O - B - S .
We 've already lost three - quarters of a million jobs this year , and some experts say that unemployment may rise to 8 % by the end of next year .
We can't wait until then to start creating new jobs .
That 's why I 'm proposing to give our businesses a new American jobs tax credit for each new employee they hire here in the United States over the next two years .
To fuel the real engine of job creation in this country , I 've also proposed eliminating all capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and start - up companies , and I 've proposed an additional tax incentive through next year to encourage new small business investment .
It is time to protect the jobs we have and to create the jobs of tomorrow by unlocking the drive , and ingenuity , and innovation of the American people .
And we should fast track the loan guarantees we passed for our auto industry and provide more as needed so that they can build the energy - efficient cars America needs to end our dependence on foreign oil .
We will also save one million jobs by creating a Jobs and Growth Fund that will provide money to states and local communities so that they can move forward with projects to rebuild and repair our roads , our bridges , and our schools .
A lot of these projects and these jobs are at risk right now because of budget shortfalls , but this fund will make sure they continue .
The second part of my rescue plan is to provide immediate relief to families who are watching their paycheck shrink and their jobs and life savings disappear .
I 've already proposed a middle - class tax cut for 95 % of workers and their families , but today I 'm calling on Congress to pass a plan so that the IRS will mail out the first round of those tax cuts as soon as possible .
We should also extend and expand unemployment benefits to those Americans who have lost their jobs and are having a harder time finding new ones in this weak economy .
And we should stop making them pay taxes on those unemployment insurance benefits as well .
At a time when the ups and downs of the stock market have rarely been so unpredictable and dramatic , we also need to give families and retirees more flexibility and security when it comes to their retirement savings .
I welcome Senator McCain 's proposal to waive the rules that currently force our seniors to withdraw from their 401 ( k ) s even when the market is bad .
I think that 's a good idea , but I think we need to do even more .
Since so many Americans will be struggling to pay the bills over the next year , I propose that we allow every family to withdraw up to 15 % from their IRA or 401 ( k ) - up to a maximum of $ 10,000 - without any fine or penalty throughout 2009 .
This will help families get through this crisis without being forced to make painful choices like selling their homes or not sending their kids to college .
The third part of my rescue plan is to provide relief for homeowners who are watching their home values decline while their property taxes go up .
Earlier this year I pushed for legislation that would help homeowners stay in their homes by working to modify their mortgages .
When Secretary Paulson proposed his original financial rescue plan it included nothing for homeowners .
When Senator McCain was silent on the issue , I insisted that it include protections for homeowners .
Now the Treasury must use the authority its been granted and move aggressively to help people avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes .
We do n't need a new law or a new $ 300 billion giveaway to banks like Senator McCain has proposed , we just need to act quickly and decisively .
I 've already proposed a mortgage tax credit for struggling homeowners worth 10 % of the interest you pay on your mortgage and we should move quickly to pass it .
We should also change the unfair bankruptcy laws that allow judges to write down your mortgage if you own six or seven homes , but not if you have only one .
And for all those cities and small towns that are facing a choice between cutting services like health care and education or raising property taxes , we will provide the funding to prevent those tax hikes from happening .
We cannot allow homeowners and small towns to suffer because of the mess made by Wall Street and Washington .
For those Americans in danger of losing their homes , today I 'm also proposing a three - month moratorium on foreclosures .
If you are a bank or lender that is getting money from the rescue plan that passed Congress , and your customers are making a good - faith effort to make their mortgage payments and re-negotiate their mortgages , you will not be able to foreclose on their home for three months .
We need to give people the breathing room they need to get back on their feet .
Finally , this crisis has taught us that we cannot have a sound economy with a dysfunctional financial system .
We passed a financial rescue plan that has the promise to help stabilize the financial system , but only if we act quickly , effectively and aggressively .
The Treasury Department must move quickly with their plan to put more money into struggling banks so they have enough to lend , and they should do it in a way that protects taxpayers instead of enriching CEOs .
There was a report yesterday that some financial institutions participating in this rescue plan are still trying to avoid restraints on CEO pay .
That 's not just wrong , it 's an outrage to every American whose tax dollars have been put at risk .
No major investor would ever make an investment if they did n't think the corporation was being prudent and responsible , and we should n't expect taxpayers to think any differently .
We should also be prepared to extend broader guarantees if it becomes necessary to stabilize our financial system .
I also believe that Treasury should not limit itself to purchasing mortgage - backed securities - it should help unfreeze markets for individual mortgages , student loans , car loans , and credit card loans ..
And I think we need to do even more to make loans available in two very important areas of our economy : small businesses and communities .
On Friday , I proposed Small Business Rescue Plan that would create an emergency lending fund to lend money directly to small businesses that need cash for their payroll or to buy inventory .
It 's what we did after 9/11 , and it allowed us to get low - cost loans out to tens of thousands of small businesses .
We 'll also make it easier for private lenders to make small business loans by expanding the Small Business Administration 's loan guarantee program .
By temporarily eliminating fees for borrowers and lenders , we can unlock the credit that small firms need to pay their workers and keep their doors open .
And today , I 'm also proposing that we maintain the ability of states and local communities that are struggling to maintain basic services without raising taxes to continue to get the credit they need .
Congress should pass this emergency rescue plan as soon as possible .
If Washington can move quickly to pass a rescue plan for our financial system , there 's no reason we can't move just as quickly to pass a rescue plan for our middle - class that will create jobs , provide relief , and help homeowners .
And if Congress does not act in the coming months , it will be one of the first things I do as President of the United States .
Because we can't wait any longer to start creating new jobs ; to help struggling communities and homeowners , and to provide real and immediate relief to families who are worried not only about this month 's bills , but their entire life savings .
This plan will help ease those anxieties , and along with the other economic policies I 've proposed , it will begin to create new jobs , grow family incomes , and put us back on the path to prosperity .
I wo n't pretend this will be easy or come without cost .
We 'll have to set priorities as never before , and stick to them .
That means pursuing investments in areas such as energy , education and health care that bear directly on our economic future , while deferring other things we can afford to do without .
It means scouring the federal budget , line - by - line , ending programs that we do n't need and making the ones we do work more efficiently and cost less .
It also means promoting a new ethic of responsibility .
Part of the reason this crisis occurred is that everyone was living beyond their means - from Wall Street to Washington to even some on Main Street .
CEOs got greedy .
Politicians spent money they did n't have .
Lenders tricked people into buying home they could n't afford and some folks knew they could n't afford them and bought them anyway .
We 've lived through an era of easy money , in which we were allowed and even encouraged to spend without limits ; to borrow instead of save .
Now , I know that in an age of declining wages and skyrocketing costs , for many folks this was not a choice but a necessity .
People have been forced to turn to credit cards and home equity loans to keep up , just like our government has borrowed from China and other creditors to help pay its bills .
But we now know how dangerous that can be .
Once we get past the present emergency , which requires immediate new investments , we have to break that cycle of debt .
Our long - term future requires that we do what 's necessary to scale down our deficits , grow wages and encourage personal savings again .
It 's a serious challenge .
But we can do it if we act now , and if we act as one nation .
We can bring a new era of responsibility and accountability to Wall Street and to Washington .
We can put in place common - sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again .
We can make investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the 21st century .
We can restore a sense of fairness and balance that will give ever American a fair shot at the American dream .
And above all , we can restore confidence - confidence in America , confidence in our economy , and confidence in ourselves .
This country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we have n't seen in nearly a century .
And future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test .
Will they say that this was a time when America lost its way and its purpose ?
When we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession ?
Or will they say that this was another one of those moments when America overcame ?
When we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other 's success ?
This is one of those moments .
I realize you 're cynical and fed up with politics .
I understand that you 're disappointed and even angry with your leaders .
You have every right to be .
But despite all of this , I ask of you what 's been asked of the American people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history .
I ask you to believe - to believe in yourselves , in each other , and in the future we can build together .
Together , we can not fail .
Not now .
Not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save .
Not when there are so many Americans without jobs and without homes .
Not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor , or send their child to college , or pay their bills at the end of the month .
Not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves .
We can do this .
Americans have done this before .
Some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe I can't go to college but my child can ; maybe I can't have my own business but my child can .
I may have to rent , but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own .
I may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for Senate .
I might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the United States of America .
Now it falls to us .
Together , we can not fail .
Together , we can overcome the broken policies and divided politics of the last eight years .
Together , we can renew an economy that rewards work and rebuilds the middle class .
Together , we can create millions of new jobs , and deliver on the promise of health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete .
We can do this if we come together ; if we have confidence in ourselves and each other ; if we look beyond the darkness of the day to the bright light of hope that lies ahead .
Together , we can change this country and change this world .
Thank you ,
God bless you , and may God bless America .

The designer was able to reduce fuel consumption aboard these trucks by 30 percent .

The last time gas prices were as high as in 2008 was the early 1970s .
The OPEC Oil Embargo caused gas prices to skyrocket in the United States .
It was then that German designer Luigi Colani first considered making a more streamlined truck that uses less gas .
When gas prices soared again in 2008 , Colani 's ideas began to look attractive once more .
Fortunately , he'd been tinkering with his designs , improving them in the course of the nearly 40 years that passed .
Colani creates what he calls biodynamic concepts [ source : BusinessWeek ] .
He borrows heavily from the contours and rounded angles found in nature for everything from chairs to showers .
He considers himself a " three - dimensional philosopher of the future , " and he 's created the concepts to back up such a claim [ source : New York Times ] .
This includes his concepts for 18 - wheelers .

In the face of high gas prices and the resulting driving bans , Colani turned his attention toward creating more fuel - efficient trucks .
His first versions reduced fuel consumption by 25 percent [ source : BusinessWeek ] .
How does one take something as lumbering as a semi and make it green ?
For starters , Colani applied his organic - minded designs to the exterior , making his semis more aerodynamic .
With their wide , flat grilles and boxy shapes , semis are among the least aerodynamic vehicles on the road .
Once a truck reaches a speed of 50 mph , aerodynamic drag -- the pressure exerted on the vehicle as it moves through air -- there 's an increased need for power to keep the truck moving at a steady pace [ source : Cummins ] .
Colani added sweeping contours and lines to his semi designs , giving them a futuristic look and reducing wind - resistance .
He also got under the hood to tinker with the engine .
He improved upon a 2005 Mercedes - Benz semi by adding a direct - injection , turbo - charged diesel engine to the vehicle .
The result ?
It had almost 150 more horsepower than the original engine and consumed 30 percent less fuel [ source : Discovery ] .
Still , he remained unsatisfied .
In 2007 , Colani and Siemens collaborated on a new truck .
This semi is perhaps more appropriately referred to as a cockpit :
The enclosed space is raised above the semi's frame and holds one person .
What 's more , the truck lacks a steering wheel -- it 's driven entirely with a single joystick .
The whole semi resembles the head and beak of a predatory bird in flight .
With this incarnation , Colani 's design managed to reduce fuel consumption by 50 percent [ source : Discovery ] .
That reduction comes exclusively from exterior aerodynamic changes , without any modifications to the engine .
So why do n't we see Colani 's designs in use by truckers on roads around the globe ?
Perhaps the biggest obstacle is cost .
Colani's Siemens concept truck cost $ 1 million to construct .
Mass - produced trucks are slightly less expensive .
For example , a new 2007 International 9900 semi sells for around $ 100,000 [ source : Commercial Truck Trader ] .
Getting that cost down to a marketable price will require a major semi manufacturer to mass - produce the truck .
While Colani is an independent designer , this would n't be the first time one of his concepts was embraced by a car company .
His designs have been built by the likes of Ferrari and Dodge .
Perhaps with fuel prices getting higher and truckers striking , a name like Peterbilt or Mack will be added to that list in the future .

That ’s right , it appears that the Pittsburgh police are investigating the case of the McCain volunteer who claims she was beaten and robbed and had a ‘ B ’ carved into her cheek , and it may be a hoax .
The alleged victim claims that she was at an ATM in Pittsburgh when the alleged assailant approached her , robbed her of $ 60 , then , noticing she had a McCain bumper sticker , beat her , and carved a ‘ B ’ into her cheek with a knife .
As the photo indicates , the assailant must have done the deed very carefully , as not to cause permanent damage .
The incident , although it had been claimed to happen right near the ATM , shows no evidence of the assault on the ATM ’s security camera .
If Ashley Todd ’s claims are false , this could be a media nightmare for the already beleaguered campaign that many charge with untruths meant to show their opponent as a terrorist and child molester .
A curious aspect to the photograph is the ‘ B ’ is backwards , as if the assailant carved the letter into the alleged victim ’s cheek while looking in a mirror .
More on this story as the investigation continues .
Check back early , and often .
UPDATE : She definitively hoaxed it , according to police .
She ’s a scourge on society , and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law .
What a psycho .
Donald & Susan Sutherland who started the ice cream chain Coldstone Creamery have donated $ 10,000 to prop 102 to
ban marriage in Arizona .
Now , people are n't quite sure if the founders are still tied in some way to the company either financially , or in some other capacity .
I do n't want to jump to any conclusions by notifying readers to
boycott or protest Coldstone but doing some internet searching it
appears the connection between the Sutherlands and Coldstone may still
be alive .
In a segment on Oprah this year :
" O presents a lot of Cold Stone Creamery stats that will do nothing more than occupy more space in the section of our brains earmarked for " crap we 'll never need to know . "
It started as a mom and pop shop in Tempe .
At one point , the business was down to making $ 6 a day .
The New York Times printed a story about them as a " favorite ice cream . "
Today , they are a $ 500 million business with over 1,400 stores .
But the most telling moment comes near the end of the segment when one of the owners , Susan Sutherland , makes ice cream treats for O and some other guests .
But she unknowingly gives O's ice cream away .
The tension is almost palpable as the MPWITU is clearly perturbed by this commoner 's mistake .
"
( A Guy's Guide to Oprah )
If Susan Sutherland is on Oprah and according to this article is an" owner " the connection may still be alive and well ?
Thoughts for acourse of action , or any other sources to prove a possible connection ?
Please stay tuned , I am sure we will get the low down , or is it down low on this shortly .
We are now several weeks into the weird humiliation that the Republican party inflicted upon us Americans with their choice of Sarah Palin as their nominee for Vice - President .
Here we are , at as precarious a crossroad as history is ever likely to offer up , yet there stands Sarah Palin regurgitating George W Bush 's ' good guys - bad guys ' baby talk .
I despair .
When I hear her failing to recall the name of a single newspaper she 'd ever read , I feel willing to offer up my teenage son as a sacrifice to the Republican party ; he could serve in her stead with so much more fluency .
When she prattles smoothly yet non-responsively to questions about the war , economics or foreign policy - or when she brightly changes the subject altogether - I want to weep .
Palin is a never - ending train wreck of ignorance , inconsistency , outright contradiction and sneering .
During her debate with Democratic vice - presidential nominee Joe Biden , she chatted up soccer moms and hockey moms , her mom and her pop and , by golly , yours too .
She winked and she dimpled and ' goshed ' and ' doggoned ' it .
She gave a ' shout - out ' to some third graders in Wasilla , promising ' extra credit ' for staying up to listen .
Less remarked upon was the substance .
Despite the enormous variety of public crises we face , she dismissed virtually all forms of government regulation by invoking ' private contract ' rather than collective duty ; ' personal responsibility ' rather than public oversight ; and ' tolerance ' rather than civil rights .
She misspoke the name of a commanding general , she went unchallenged when she expressed her arch - creationist belief that humanity has had no hand in global warming , tucking all that away cosily but dismissively : ' I do n't wanna argue about causes . '
Similarly , Palin was unchallenged in her head - spinning assertions about the powers of the vice - presidency , endorsing an unqualified ' flexibility ' possibly exceeding Dick Cheney 's assertion of a vastly expanded , alarmingly imperial concept of a ' unitary executive ' .
At the same time , her answers were so vague and addled that it was hard to tell if she actually knew what she was saying .
Yet the morning after the debate with Biden , polls showed that the race was still too close to call .
If Biden ' won ' based on knowledge and experience , it was not by enough of a margin to inspire a significant shift .
Indeed , pundits of all political persuasions were dissecting Palin 's ability to ' hold her own ' as though it were an actual measure of whether she could run the republic .
Pat Buchanan , gleeful mouthpiece of the far right , celebrated Palin as ' a fresh voice ' with a ' new vocabulary ' .
' She tossed away the questions , ' he gloated as though this were a good thing .
' She answered what she wanted to . '
Presenters on Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News channel lined up to decry the way ' we journalists ' tend to ' value knowledgeability ' while true Americans ' connect to her style ' .
Greta Van Susteren , an experienced lawyer and ubiquitous television commentator , opined : ' Whether I agree with her or not , the important thing is whether she 's plain - talking ...
I may have had the fancy education , but I love the plain talk , the direct words .
I'm a Midwesterner . '
( Whew .
Whatever is the value of a fancy education if not to inoculate against such blather ? )
The enthusiasm for the Alaskan governor reminds me of an exercise I once conducted with students .
I played them a segment of the 2007 debate between Ségolène Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy .
Very few understood French , so it was effectively an exercise in reading body language .
They were convinced that Royal had won the argument because she seemed ' emphatic ' and ' passionate ' and ' repeated her points a lot ' .
The clip I had played , however , was Royal 's least convincing moment in that debate : she was delivering a mawkish , inappropriately long - winded tongue - lashing about Sarkozy 's purported failure to tackle the plight of handicapped children .
Although her body language might have telegraphed earnest conviction , the words she was repeating with such focused intensity were something along the lines of : ' I am not going to pieces , I am angry , I am angry , I am angry . '
Even if one 's political sympathies lay with Royal , it was clear why that encounter might have lost her the election .
My students accurately translated Royal 's passion and conviction .
They also accurately translated Sarkozy 's discomfort at that moment .
But without an understanding of the substance of what was said , it would be impossible to see how much her words contradicted the commanding body language .
The enthusiastic responses to Palin 's presentations remind me of that exercise .
Yes , Palin 's delivery is perky and self - assured .
But if one pays attention to the substance , it 's impossibly vacuous .
That so few do pay attention makes me think that listening to the debates must be like a foreign language for some of my compatriots .
Perhaps this is laziness or political illiteracy .
Perhaps it 's a failure of education .
Perhaps there 's a measure of raw racism : better to vote for anyone other than the black guy .
Or perhaps it 's a manifestation of gender fundamentalism , by which any biological formation of a woman can stand in for Hillary Clinton .
At least as distracting are the polarities jumbling American political discourse : i.e. not just good versus evil , male versus female , black versus white , but eastern elitism versus western frontier spirit ; secular humanism versus speaking - in - tongues theocracy ; scientism versus creationism ; ' tolerance ' versus equal rights ; ultra-libertarianism versus civic engagement .
The Republicans ' best operatives have been playing these tensions against each other for decades .
Against the backdrop of such a frighteningly incoherent cultural landscape , Sarah Palin plays Mom .
She speaks to us in a wipe - your - nose and sit - up - straight inflection that is quite Orwellian - if Orwell had anticipated that newspeak might come packaged as old - fashioned - country - horse - sense speak .
And so we love her , Mother Sarah .
She 's simple , she 's pretty , she 's as fierce as a tiger protecting her cubs .
So what if storms are rattling the windowpanes ?
We get a glass of warm milk and a big gold star just for staying up late while she tells us reassuring bedtime stories .

We create software and websites to display and represent information to people .
That information could be anything ; a company ’s product list , pictures of your vacation , or an instant message from a friend .
At this moment , there ’s more information available to you than at any other time in history .
All this information has a lot of positive effects , but it also creates challenges .
“ What information consumes is rather obvious ; it consumes the attention of its recipients … a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention ” ( Simon 1971 ) .
When attention becomes a scarce resource , it ’s important to invest it wisely .
Information architects and designers play a critical role in ensuring the products they design provide users ’ with a return on their investment of attention .
The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi ( 1990 ) has described focused attention as “ psychic energy ” .
Like energy in the traditional sense , no work can be done without it , and through work that energy is consumed .
Most of us have experienced a mental / emotional state where all of our attention ( or energy ) is totally focused on an activity .
Csikszentmihalyi ( 1990 ) named this state “ flow , ” based on how participants in his studies described the experience .
In this state of consciousness , people often experience intense concentration and feelings of enjoyment , coupled with peak performance .
Hours pass by in what seems like minutes .
We tend to enter these states in environments with few interruptions , where our attention becomes focused by a challenge that we ’re confident we can handle with our existing skills .
Feedback is instantaneous , so we can always judge how close we are to accomplishing our task and reaching our goal .
The importance of the task influences our level of motivation and perceptions of how difficult the task will be .
Attention and Flow
The elements associated with the flow state can be classified into the three areas ; 1 . Causes of Flow 2 . Characteristics of Flow 3 .
Consequences of Flow ( Novak , Hoffman and Yung , 1999 ) .
1. Causes of Flow
A clear goal
Immediate feedback on the success of attempts to reach that goal
A challenge you ’re confident you have the skills to handle
2. Characteristics of Flow
Total concentration and focused attention
A sense of control over interactions
Openness to new things
Increased exploratory behavior
Increased learning
Positive feelings
3. Consequences of Flow
Loss of consciousness of self
Distortions in the perception of time
Activity is perceived as intrinsically rewarding
As designers , we focus on the elements that precede or cause flow .
Users visit sites with pre-existing goals ( e.g. , finding information about a product ) .
These goals evolve over time as users complete tasks and their attention is drawn to other information .
The main elements designers can control are :
Providing immediate feedback
Balancing the perception of challenge against users ’ skills
Designing for Flow
You do n’t need to take a course or learn a new software package to design for flow .
In fact , you ’re probably already doing it .
Begin by considering the desired outcome of every interaction and then removing everything that distracts the user from accomplishing that outcome .
Start by removing distractions or impediments wherever possible .
For both physical and interactive products , this means reducing or eliminating both external ( i.e. , environmental ) and internal ( i.e. , pain , discomfort , anxiety ) distractions that cause emotional responses like frustration or physical discomfort .
Emotions demand and divert the user ’s attention .
Providing immediate feedback for all user actions helps to reduce user anxiety .
The effective use of layout , information design , typography , interaction design and information architecture all help in balancing the perception of challenge against the user ’s skill level .
Information should be broken down into manageable “ chunks ” that do n’t overwhelm users cognitive faculties .
When it comes to balancing the users ’ perception of challenge , think of it this way : too much challenge with too little skill causes anxiety ; and too little challenge with too much skill causes boredom .
Flow occurs at the boundary between boredom and anxiety .
Think of it as a channel that runs between anxiety and boredom . ( Figure 1 )
Figure 1 : Anxiety , Boredom and Flow ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1990 )
( captions added van Gorp , 2006 )
As the challenges we face increase , we become more anxious and lose flow .
Re-entering flow involves increasing our skills to match these challenges and reduce anxiety .
As we increase our skill level , we become bored unless we increase the challenge to match our greater abilities .
To understand how we can reduce distractions , let ’s examine the different elements of flow again to see how each can be applied to user experience .
The causes of flow have the most implications for website and application design .
Causes of Flow
1. A clear goal …
The user navigates to accomplish a task , like seeking information on a particular topic or surfing for fun .
This is an evolving goal , dependent on the options presented to the user and aided by logical information architecture , intuitive navigation , effective wayfinding and clear options for proceeding like information scent , breadcrumbs , meaningful labels , clear page titles , etc .
2 . With immediate feedback on the success of attempts to reach that goal …
The user receives quick , sensory feedback in the form of a visual shift and / or sound from links , buttons , menus , or other navigation items .
3. Presented as a challenge that you have the skills to handle .
The opportunities for action are balanced with the user ’s ability .
At a basic level , this is accomplished by providing an uncluttered interface and eliminating unnecessary information to limit the user ’s cognitive load .
As the users ’ skill increases over time , the interface can increase its complexity as well .
Adaptive interface technologies allow the user to adjust the complexity of the interface to meet their enhanced skills .
Flow and Emotion
Flow tends to occur in situations with higher levels of challenge and skill .
If the challenge is too easy , or user skill levels are very high , anxiety can be so low that there is little motivation to do anything .
This level of activation or “ arousal ” in the body is the physiological ( i.e. , bodily ) dimension of emotion .
The level of arousal affects how intensely we experience a given emotion , and intense emotions demand our attention .
In evolutionary terms , it ’s easy to see why ; the more attention your ancestors paid to predators , the more likely they were to survive and reproduce , passing their genes on to their descendants , people like you and me .
Both pleasant and unpleasant objects and experiences can increase arousal levels .
Frustration and the excitement both increase arousal levels .
So do large images , bright colors , and high contrast ( van Gorp , 2006 ) .
For example , increasing the size of an image and moving anyone in it closer within the frame increase arousal levels .
Figure 2 : Interpersonal Distance and Arousal
How does looking at the picture on the right make you feel compared to the one on the left ?
The key to balancing arousal is to match the perceived challenge to the users ’ skill level .
Since skill levels differ from one user to the next based on their previous experiences and the type of task , interfaces should be very user - friendly but also allow more advanced users to find challenges appropriate for their skill level .
These challenges can include the visual aspects as well as the content ( King 2003 ) .
To put it simply , everything about a site , including content , information architecture , interaction design , and visual design can contribute to flow .
Goal - directed vs. Experiential Use
Different motivations for using a website require different designs to facilitate flow ( Novak , Hoffman and Yung 1996 ) .
Novice users tend to see the Internet in a playful way , while more experienced users tend to view the Internet in a more utilitarian way ( King 2003 ) .
This leads to a distinction between experiential and goal - directed use .
Flow tends to occur more often during goal - directed use , because of the higher challenge involved .
Novice Users – Experiential use
Less challenging
More exploratory
Entertainment - oriented
Experienced Users – tendency towards Goal - directed use
More challenging
Less exploratory
Connected with tasks ( e.g. research , work and shopping )
The lower level of challenge in an entertainment - oriented , experiential site means there is a lower level of anxiety connected with its use .
Someone who is less anxious is more capable of using creative thought to determine how to navigate a website and overlook minor problems .
Motivation here is driven by subconscious arousal triggered by interesting visual elements , bright colors or high contrast .
Experiential sites can and should be more arousing visually to demand the greater attention that can lead to flow experiences .
Figure 3 : Disturbia film site
An example of a visually rich , entertainment - oriented site with little or no challenge involved .
The greater challenge of completing tasks ( possibly under deadlines ) on a goal - directed site creates more higher arousal .
Anxiety makes users less able to think creatively when problems are encountered .
If a product will be used in a stressful environment , like a hospital operating room , usability becomes crucial .
All relevant information needs to be close at hand and visible and feedback should be clear and immediate .
A goal - directed site can and should be less visually rich so that users , already anxious at the prospect of a challenging task , are not overwhelmed .
Figure 4 : Yahoo
When tasks are particularly unpleasant , we often lack the motivation necessary to complete them .
In these cases , increasing the arousal level through the use of narrative can increase the user ’s motivation .
The Tango
Tax website uses visual elements that resemble those found in movie posters and has a high contrast , cinematic feel that increases arousal .
The software also introduces the classic cinematic narrative element of “ us vs. them ” to help increase user motivation .

Conclusions – Traits of Websites that Encourage Flow
How you apply these ideas depends on your target audience , as well as their internal and external use contexts .
Consider the likely emotional state of your users .
Are there loud noises , crowds , brightly colored objects or other distractions in the user ’s environment ?
Here are some basic website traits that will help to encourage flow .

Balance the Perception of Challenge With the User ’s Skill : Since user skill levels differ , it ’s up to you to balance the complexity of the visual design with the number of tasks and features people can use .
Consider whether they are likely surfing experientially for fun or completing an important task .
Tailor your sites to your audience ’s scenario of use : more visually rich for experiential use and less so for goal - directed use .
Adaptable interfaces that allow the user to increase or decrease the perceived challenge by choosing how much detail is displayed .
Simplicity helps reduce anxiety for both novices and experts , which is especially crucial in highly stressful situations .
Options for information - rich displays can introduce challenge for more experienced users .
Whether you ’re an information architect , interaction designer or visual designer , your work should compel users to invest their attention , and then provide them with a return on that investment .
Remember , designing for flow does n’t require a new set of tools or skills – only a different way of thinking .
Finding the right balance of design and challenge can help focus attention and create flow , which results in immersive and engaging user experiences .

I am usually writing about leadership development for corporate executives – high impact service opportunities to involve business people and philanthropists in global issues .
Today , I am thrilled to write about a national program to engage children here in the U.S. in saving the lives of their fellow children who are threatened by malaria in Sub - Saharan Africa , Asia , and South America .
Malaria kills 1 million people each year , 75 % of whom are children under the age of 5 .
Among the programs created and pioneered by youth volunteers at Children for Children is Sweat for Nets .
With support from Alcoa Foundation , this national youth movement engages young people from diverse backgrounds in planning fun and meaningful projects at the local level to raise awareness about malaria as a global threat and funds to purchase insecticide - treated bed nets for prevention ( $ 10 per net to protect 3 children ) .
Children for Children , a NYC - based organization that promotes and facilitates youth service and giving , partnered with the CDC Foundation ( affiliated with the Center for Disease Control ) to facilitate bed net distribution , donations , and tracking .
Not only does Sweat for Nets address a vital matter , but the campaign also begins preparing children for future leadership – in learning about global issues as well as geography , caring for others , advocating for support , planning activities to raise money , organizing in teams , working with children from a variety of backgrounds on a common mission , and enjoying the achievement of success in helping others .
At a time when donors are watching their investments extra carefully , an organization like Children for Children has all the marks of excellence .
Sweat for Nets is only one of their outstanding programs that is highly leveraged through partnerships .
This organization also provides evidence that a small organization can have an exponential impact when there is excellent leadership , a compelling mission , and a vital vision .

Everyone knows that Oprah Winfrey is Barack Obama 's long time friend and biggest supporter .
She believes he stands for change : “ I think that what he stands for , what he has proven that he can stand for , what he has shown was worth me going out on a limb for – and I have n’t done it in the past because I have n’t felt that anybody , I did n’t know anybody well enough to be able to say , I believe in this person .
” We also hear about the tax differences between Obama and Republican rival John McCain .
Oprah is one of the highest paid women in the US , obviously she makes more than $ 250,000 .
Obama 's tax plan would effect her in a major way , but so would McCain 's tax plan .
Obama wants to tax the top earners in the US , these are the people who make over $ 250,000 .
With Obama as president Oprah would be paying $ 16 million a year more in taxes .
McCain is proposing a $ 300 billion dollar tax cut for the wealthy and for large corporations .
If McCain were to become president Oprah would be taxed $ 9 million dollars less than she currently is - like handing her a nice fat $ 9 million dollar check .
This is the best example of the stark differences between the two candidates .
Under Obama the middle class will benefit , under McCain the wealthy will benefit .
What would you rather have ?
$ 16 million given back to the middle class , or $ 9 million handed back to the already wealthy ?
It seems like an easy choice for me .
And although Oprah will be paying much more in taxes , she believes in what Obama stands for , and the changes he will bring .
Please stand with me and vote for barack Obama on November 4th .
If you 're reading this on death row , you have our condolences .
It ca n't be encouraging to know that your government thinks society would be improved by killing you .
On the upside , however , your ...
Obama mocks self , McCain , and vice versa
At the Al Smith dinner at the Waldorf in Manhattan , where the candidates are expected to roast one another , both do .
Obama was a bit harder on his rival , and perhaps also on himself .
" There is no other crowd in America I 'd rather be palling around with , " he says .
" Can somebody tell me what happened to the Greek columns that I requested ?
Also :
" Contrary to the rumors you may have heard , i was not actually born in a manger , i was actually born on Krypton and sent here by my father Jor - El to save the Earth . "
And : " I punched a paparazzi in the face on my way out of Spagos .
I even spilled my soy chai latte all over my Shih Tzu -- it was really embarrassing . "
Mocking McCain , he started with his age , addressing the grandson of the former New York governor for whom the dinner was named .
" I obviously never knew your grandfather , but from everything Senator McCain has told me , the two of them had a great time together before Prohibition , " he said .
He also mocked the houses : " This crisis has been eight times harder on John McCain . "
And the GOP : " Whoever would have thought that a cross - dressing mayor from New York City would have had a tough time winning the Republican nomination ?
Tough primary you had there , John . "
Obama also included a shot at Fox before a gracious passage on McCain and serious words on the financial crisis .
" Fox News accused me of fathering two African - American children in wedlock , " he said , turning again to McCain .
" Is fox news included in the meida ?
Because i'm always hearing about the love ... "
McCain , who spoke first , also had the crowd in stitches at times .
He mentioned that Biden had claimed that Joe the Plumber is n't rich enough for a McCain tax cut .
" What they do n't know is that Joe The Plumber recently signed a lucrative contract to handle all the work on all seven of [ McCain 's ] houses . "
" I can't shake the feeling that some people here are voting for me , " McCain said .
" Nice to see you , Hillary . "
UPDATE : Jonathan Martin has more on McCain 's speech .

Obama ’s ‘ Diplomacy ’ Wins a Republican Endorsement
By Adam Graham - Silverman , CQ Staff
The ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee parted ways with his party ’s presidential nominee Wednesday by endorsing Democrat Barack Obama ’s approach to diplomacy .
In a lengthy speech at the National Defense University , Indiana Sen . Richard G. Lugar weighed the benefits of talking to foreign leaders , including U.S. enemies , against other actions , such as military force .
The issue marks one of the sharpest divides between Obama and John McCain , who has called the Democratic nominee naive for suggesting that he would sit down with leaders such as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Lugar , however , praised Obama , noting that isolation often does not resolve contentious issues .
Lord West said he advised navy colleagues about internet privacy
No decision has been taken to create a huge database containing details of all phone calls , e-mails and internet use , security minister Lord West says .
The Information Commissioner has warned that such a database could be a " step too far for the British way of life " .
Asked in the House of Lords about that warning , Lord West said : " It is very early days as to where we go on this . "
But the switch from traditional phones meant the " entirely new " communication methods had to be assessed , he said .
There have been reports that the giant database is planned for the government 's proposed Communications Data Bill .
That led Information Commissioner Richard Thomas to call in his annual report this week for a full public debate first .
Mr Thomas acknowledged that " targeted and duly authorised " interception of communications by terrorists and other suspects could be " invaluable " .
But he warned that people must still " stand up " for their " fundamental liberties " and freedoms .
There will be more people look at your internet information than look at a postcard when you write it
Security minister Lord West " Lines have to be drawn somewhere , and there should be a full democratic debate about where exactly the lines should be drawn , " Mr Thomas said in his report .
" Do we really want the police , security services and other organs of the state to have access to more and more aspects of our private lives , " his report added .
Speculation that the government was considering collecting the information - including numbers dialled , websites visited and location of mobile phones being used - has increased because it has talked about " modifying procedures for acquiring communications data " in the Communications Data Bill .
Postcard Currently police and intelligence agencies can ask telecommunication providers for information on phone calls made , texts sent and internet sites visited .
The provider can query the request , which might then go to the interception commissioner and another watchdog - but under the new proposals , that right would be removed Lord West , who is a former First Sealord and Chief of the Naval Staff , also issued a general warning about the lack of privacy in using the internet .
He said internet service providers could already assess " information about the consumer 's internet use for the provision of value - added services " .
" People must realise - and I used to say this within the Navy - there will be more people look at your internet information than look at a postcard when you write it , " he told the House of Lords .
" People tend to forget that - and [ that ] it is used for quite legal purposes , some of it . "
' Test case ' Lord West was also asked about trials by BT of an online system of advertising involving more than 30,000 of its customers , known as Phorm .
In 2006 and 2007 this matched adverts to users ' web habits , although BT did not inform customers they were part of such a project .
The peer said the government was " not aware " of the tests beforehand , and an investigation was now checking if these had been " appropriate " .
Since then BT had made a formal approach to begin a trial " of about 10,000 broadband subscribers " , Lord West said , but he was unclear if this was " covered by law " .
A test case might be needed to consider whether this was a form of " interception " , he added .
Meanwhile a 40 % pay rise for Mr Thomas has been put on hold until the autumn .
His salary had been due to increase from £ 100,000 to £ 140,000 , but this has been delayed owing to a review of his powers , responsibilities and salary scale later in the year .

What are these ?
WASHINGTON  The Senate on Wednesday upped pressure on the House to pass a $ 700 billion rescue for Wall Street by strongly approving a plan that supporters said would avert a potential economic disaster .
In a maneuver to reverse a stinging House rejection of the plan , the Senate piggybacked the bailout plan on several other popular measures : an increase in federal deposit insurance limits , expanded health coverage for mental illnesses and a bill extending several tax breaks set to expire at year 's end .
ROLL CALL : How the senators voted
The Senate passed the package on a bipartisan 74 - 25 vote .
" Help is on the way , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office said the House will vote on the Senate bill by Friday .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , predicted President Bush will be able to sign the bill " by the end of this week . "
There are indications that the strong Senate vote and added sweeteners may be causing some House opponents to reconsider .
" I am probably going to be a reluctant ' yes ' vote , " said Rep. John Shadegg of Arizona , among the 133 Republicans who voted " no " on Monday .
However , some Democrats , including House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Md. , are questioning the tax package because it is n't paid for .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would increase the federal deficit nearly $ 110 billion by 2018 .
The bailout package gives Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson sweeping authority to help troubled financial firms by buying up their shaky assets .
HOUSE SEATS : Tight races feel bailout fallout
Among those senators voting " yes " were presidential rivals John McCain , R - Ariz . , and Barack Obama , D - Ill. , and Obama 's running mate , Joe Biden , D - Del .
" This is not just a Wall Street crisis .
It 's an American crisis , " Obama said in his first Senate speech since May .
McCain did not make a Senate floor speech .
Earlier in Missouri , he said " the gears of our economy will grind to a halt " without action .
Opposition spanned the ideological spectrum .
Sen. Jim DeMint , R - S.C. , said the bailout is " leading our country into the pit of socialism . "
Meanwhile , the Senate 's self - styled socialist , Bernie Sanders , I - Vt. , said the bill helps financiers " drunk with greed . "
Besides the economic rescue plan , the final Senate - passed bill includes :
• Authority for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to insure bank deposits up to $ 250,000 .
The current limit is $ 100,000 .
• An extension of business tax breaks — including one to protect middle - class wage - earners from a bigger tax bite under the alternative minimum tax .
• A bill requiring health insurers to offer mental health coverage on a par with other medical benefits .
After a week of angry phone calls and e-mails , the tide began to turn .
Bill Novelli , head of AARP , said members of the senior citizens ' group sent 110,000 e-mails to Congress , urging intervention .
" People can't afford to wait 10 years for this economy to turn around , " Novelli said .
House leaders planned to spend Thursday pressing rank - and - file members for the dozen converts they need .
They were especially targeting the 133 House Republicans who voted against the package .
California 's David Dreier said Thursday morning that " I hated " the initial version of the bill but that he plans to vote for it this time around .
" I was very concerned with the proposal that came forward that would have allowed golden parachutes to go forward , " said Dreier , a Republican .
But he said he likes the new version because " it puts into place growth - oriented tax cuts . "
" I will tell you , the American people are angy and frustrated , " he said on ABC's Good Morning America , " saying he 's been hearing messages like " the woman who said she was concerned about getting access to a student loan for her daughter . "
Rep. Marcy Kaptur , an Ohio Democrat , said on the same program that she plans to vote no .
" I will not support this legislation because it 's the wrong medicine , " she said .
Kaptur argued that the problem should be solved by the market itself , not through governmental intervention .

Speaking of responses , we spoke with Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price this afternoon .
We were just kinda wondering why he got so angry with fellow commissioner Ken Mayfield yesterday , when Mayfield referred to Dallas County 's ticket collections office as " a black hole . "
Price 's explanation , which only gets awesomer , is after the jump .
Commissioner Price tells Unfair Park :
" It is typical Mayfield .
The problem is in the language .
While he tried to lateral to the scientific term of a black hole , our problem is that we understand language , and it 's negative and racist .
Judge [ Thomas ]
Jones took real offense .
We almost simultaneously picked up on what we called the idiom .
Ca n't do that in terms of the language .
He could have said ' a sinkhole , ' he could have said anything , but it was typical Mayfield style .
That is what we expect . "
When asked whether he took the term as " a racial pejorative , " Price said , Yes .
" Given Mayfield , it just ... you just kind of expect him to have that kind of response .
He is racist and does n’t know it .
Maybe he does know it .
I have n’t quite figured out whether he knows it or not .
I said it immediately : ' Why not a white hole ? '
And when I said , ' white hole , ' Mayfield said , ' OK , then , a pink hole ? '
That is when Jones said he was n’t going to sit here , he wanted an apology , they began to carry the discussion that way .
I said , ' It ’s a white hole and let 's move it on . ' "
Commissioner Mayfield was unavailable for comment this afternoon .

Marc on what a Democratic blowout would do to the GOP :
To the extent that geography correlates with ideology among congressional Republicans , a major sweep by the Democrats could really be in a position to completely break the gluons that bind the broader party together .
The GOP will lose a disportionate number of seats in the Northeast , Midwest and West and keep a disprortionate number of seats in the South .
So the remnant of the party , as it were , will be right - wing Southern conservatives .... even more so that it is now .
This is what happened to the British Tories after the Blair landslide in 1997 .
The rump was even more toxic after the defeat than before it .
A decade later , and they still are n't back in power , but they have managed the very difficult task of getting back to the center .
It is n't easy .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Teenage pregnancy is a problem that plagues both developed and developing countries .
The rate of teen pregnancy in the United States has decreased by 25 % from 2007 to 2011 , but they still have the highest rate among developed countries .
Among these nations ,
The US also has the highest rates of teenage abortions and sexually transmitted diseases .
It was noted that in half of the estimated 400,000 annual teen pregnancies , no method of birth control was used .
The rate of these pregnancies is higher in families with lower education and income .
Disparities in race and ethnicity is noted , as the rate of teen pregnancy in Hispanic teens and non-Hispanic blacks were two times higher than in non-Hispanic white teens .
The burden of teen pregnancy is much higher in developing nations , which is estimated at 7.3 million per year as of 2013 .
Of these , 2 million were teenagers below 14 years of age .
In third world nations , the causes of teen pregnancy include poverty , customs and traditions , and lack of education .
Early pregnancy poses a risk both to the mother and to the newborn .
In developing nations , up to 70,000 adolescents die of pregnancy and childbirth complications per year .
Compared to babies born to mothers above 20 years of age , babies born to teenagers have 50 % higher death rates .
They are also more likely to have low birth weights , which makes them prone to long term health risks .
The incidence of abortion , HIV and AIDS also rise in proportion to the rate of teen pregnancies .
Teenage pregnancy also has a significant economic impact both to developed and developing nations .
Because these teen mothers cannot join the workforce , estimated annual losses to the economy are significant .
In Kenya , Brazil and India , the figures are at $ 3.4B , $ 3.5B and $ 7.7B respectively .
In the US , teenage pregnancy costs $ 11B of taxpayers ’ money annually .
Only half of these adolescents are able to complete high school education by 22 years old .

Everyone seems to agree that the mess in the money trade stems from profligate mortgage lending half a decade ago ; banks loaned large sums to people with poor credit rating , then sold the mortgages in bundles with other , better - quality notes , then those were resold throughout the industry , and so when some borrowers failed to repay to the terms agreed , everyone was stuck with bad paper , meaning that their assets failed to match their liabilities , and Uncle had to bail them out .
Those seem to be the facts .
There 's less agreement about who is to blame .
Shall we blame the borrowers , for failing to keep their word ?
Yes , to a point ; promising to pay $ 750 a month for 25 years is a serious obligation , and to walk out on it is not generally an ethical thing to do .
However , the subject mortgages were " pushed " onto a class of person already notorious for failing to honor contracts ( except for IRS " debts , " that 's what a low credit score indicates ) , so the blame should certainly not stop there .
Additionally , these unsophisticated borrowers probably made the fair assumption that the value of the underlying security would keep on rising , perhaps after having read my 2006 " Real Estate Racket " piece , so would suffer a serious shock when , a couple of years ago , that stopped happening -- often at the very time their monthly payment was scheduled to increase .
Why , some would ask when observing that they owed more than the property was worth , should I keep paying off a mortgage when I could just hand the keys back to the bank ?
How then about the lenders ; did they cause the mess ?
Again , yes , they helped .
Consider a free society , in which all players are free to do as they wish but on their own responsibility .
You are invited to lend $ 100,000 to someone with a bug - infested home in a bad neighborhood who has not shown he 's eager to honor contracts .
Would you ?
And if you did , would you charge just the usual 6 % interest , or thereabouts ?
To ask the question is to answer it ; you would almost certainly not , but if you did , you 'd make sure you charged double or triple that rate so as to offset some expected bad loans .
And you would not offer a 90 % or 100 % mortgage , but cap it at , perhaps , 70 % so that if it went bad , you 'd have a fair chance of repossessing the property and selling it quickly to recover the loss .
This is all obvious and elementary -- in a free society .
There would be some , concerned to give a helping hand to the less fortunate , who would club together to start a fund to lend money to such borrowers at low rates -- but they would be charities and would know it .
They would expect to lose some money , and would treat such losses as charitable giving , pro bono publico .
For that reason , their notes would not be easy to sell to other financial institutions ; the club would bear its own risk but everyone would be content .
But during the last decade , that is not at all what has been happening .
There were some possibly well - meaning idiots who wanted to help the less fortunate by taking a non-market level of risk , but they did it with someone else 's money ; and that is not charity but theft , fraud , or both .
Sheldon Richman identified the smoking gun as the Community Reinvestment Act , as updated periodically since first enacted in 1977 ; mortgage lenders were commanded to push money at these subprime borrowers , and so they had to obey ; they behaved as no rational , free - market , self - interested lender would ever dream of behaving .
So we come to government , which wrote that Act and similar ones to distort the operation of the money trade ; is it to blame for the mess ?
Absolutely it is , and not just by obliging rational lenders to make irrational loans .
Government also made it easy , especially since 2001 , by lowering the Fed rate and so pumping " money " into the economy -- cranking the printing press , if you will .
Lending banks then had a stick to make them take inordinate risks and a carrot to provide the means to do it .
Throw the money out there , sell the note someone else like the quasi - government Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and all will be well .
The newly - created fiat money not only facilitated the loans ; by empowering buyers to bid higher , it stimulated inflation of the prices of the properties the loans were to finance .
And there was an implicit promise that if things went badly , Uncle would rush to the rescue , and last week that promise was made explicit -- to the tune of nearly a trillion of our dollars , which we 'll be paying in terms of double - digit inflation starting next year .
Now we can see the symmetry of this mess .
It came about because money was created out of thin air and made to flood the mortgage market ; and is now allegedly being cured by creating some more money out of thin air and made to flood the balance sheets of the lending industry .
It came about because government prohibited rational free choices in mortgage lending by its regulations , and it is allegedly being cured by writing extra regulations -- perhaps , ones that contradict those in place -- further to inhibit rational free choices in mortgage lending , for both the leading Presidential candidates promised only last week to do that , so exhibiting their absolute lack of interest in rational free - market economics .
And it came about because borrowers had all their lives in government school been taught that they had an " entitlement " to other peoples ' money , and it is allegedly being cured by demonstrating they were quite right .
As Anthony Alexander so often says , there is no rational alternative to the free market .
Out of the mess has arisen the rumor that we are about to enter a deep depression like that of the 1930s .
Is it true ?
There are eerie parallels , so it could be so ; but it 's worth noting what they are , and what they are not .
In both cases , the trigger was a market crash following a bubble ( in 1929 of stocks , in 2008 of housing ) , and in both cases the bubble and crash were caused by an injection into the economy of fiat " money " by the government .
But the 1929 crash did not cause the Depression , it merely created circumstances in which one could easily arise ; all previous crashes worked themselves out in a couple of years because the market was free to fix them .
In 1930 - 45 , that could not happen because of massive and repeated government intervention , as Rothbard so expertly proved in his indispensable America 's Great Depression .
The question for us now is therefore :
Will government today intervene again , causing new , huge disruptions -- or has it learned anything in the last half century ?
Early indications of the answer to that are clearly that it will intervene and has learned nothing ; again , both Presidential candidates are promising new rules for the finance business , and the influential leftist commentator Mark Shields observed last Friday on the " Lehrer News Hour " that " at a time like this , nobody is a libertarian " -- that is , everyone wants government to do something .
Everyone he knew , presumably ; everyone in the government industry .
He was surely correct .
On the other hand , FDR was breaking new ground as a fascist ; he was finding out what worked and what did n't , and even his adversaries knew nothing of what we have learned in the years since .
Today , the fascists of D.C. have over half a century of experience in how to milk the capitalist cow without causing its demise , and we their adversaries are a whole lot better informed and a whole lot more articulate -- and we have the Internet , and are not shy about publicizing their malfeasance .
There are fine think tanks with considerable influence and scholarship ( even though they fail to see the obvious -- that government is an entity necessarily hostile to humanity which must vanish altogether ) .
These factors may well moderate the malfeasance and prevent a full - blown depression .
There is a final factor , that is different between 2008 and 1929 : a considerable subset of those adversaries understand how a zero - government society would work , and why one is absolutely necessary for the survival of the human race , and some of us have started to cause one actually to come about in short order .
On reasonable and stated assumptions , that process will take its good effect as soon as the 2020s ; so even if government does cause a depression in the next decade , when we emerge at the other end , we will never have another .
You have a chance to answer that question , as one man is auctioning off a massive 886 - piece Transformers collection .
While they 're not all boxed , the pictures do show an obsession that most likely means everything is in good condition .
He 's selling everything he has , except the five boxed autobots .
He 's keeping those .
The buy - it - now price is $ 66,800 .
Some of the notices on the auction are amusing .
" Keep in mind that the repeats are not typos .
In some cases , I have 2 or 3 of certain figures .
There are also over 1,150 photos of just over half the collection ( boxes from different angles ) which are at : http://tfcollector.net/collection.rar. "
Over a thousand pictures of over 800 Transformers .
Just imagine that for a moment .
Also , is n't one of these guys a firearm ?

This is exactly why we send astronauts to risk their life to service Hubble : in a paper published last week in the Astrophysical Journal , scientists detail the discovery of a new unidentified object in the middle of nowhere .
I do n't know about you , but when a research paper conclusion says " We suggest that the transient may be one of a new class " I get a chill of oooh - aaahness down my spine .
Especially when after a hundred days of observation , it disappeared from the sky with no explanation .
Get your tinfoil hats out , because it gets even weirder .
The object also appeared out of nowhere .
It just was n't there before .
In fact , they do n't even know where it is exactly located because it did n't behave like anything they know .
Apparently , it can't be closer than 130 light - years but it can be as far as 11 billion light - years away .
It 's not in any known galaxy either .
And they have ruled out a supernova too .
It 's something that they have never encountered before .
In other words : they do n't have a single clue about where or what the heck this thing is .
The shape of the light curve is inconsistent with microlensing .
In addition to being inconsistent with all known supernova types , is not matched to any spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database .

The only thing the astronomers - working on the Supernova Cosmology Project - can tell is that it appeared all of the sudden in the direction of a cluster with the catchy name of CL 1432.5+3332.8 , about 8.2 billion light - years away .
Hubble caught a spark that continued to brighten during a 100 - day period , peaking at the 21st magnitude , only to fade away in the same period of time .
Apparently , a scientist at the LHC declared that the object is similar to the flash that an Imperial Star Destroyer does when reaching Warp 10 .
Either that or some dust on the Hubble lenses , so someone tell NASA to get some Windex up there too .

Babies who sleep in rooms with a fan have a dramatically lower risk for sudden infant death syndrome , a new study shows .
The finding is the latest evidence to suggest that a baby ’s sleep environment is a critical factor in the risk for SIDS , which is diagnosed when the sudden death of an infant ca n’t be explained by other health concerns .
Since 1992 the rate of SIDS deaths has dropped by 56 percent , from 1.2 deaths per 1,000 live births to about 1 death per 2,000 live births .
The decline is linked to a national “ Back to Sleep ” campaign that promotes putting babies on their backs instead of the stomach , which has been shown to lower risk for sudden death .
The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends that parents avoid soft bedding , allow a baby to use a pacifier if he or she wants , and avoid overheating a baby ’s room as ways to lower the risk for SIDS .
Despite the gains , SIDS continues to be the leading cause of death among infants in the first year of life , and researchers are looking for additional measures to lower risk .
The latest study compared the sleeping circumstances of 185 babies who died of SIDS with another 312 randomly selected babies who were matched by race , ethnicity , country of origin and age .
The study , published today in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , found that simply having a fan in the room lowered a baby ’s risk of SIDS by 72 percent .
The gains were even greater if the baby was wrongly placed on its stomach or was sleeping in a warmer room , both of which are risk factors for SIDS .
“ Even though we do n’t know why certain babies are more susceptible , sleeping environment matters , ’’ said Dr. De-Kun Li , reproductive and perinatal epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente ’s division of research in Oakland , Calif . , and a co-author of the study .
While the study was n’t designed to identify why fans make a difference , the theory is that by circulating the air , fans lower the risk of “ rebreathing ” by the baby .
The rebreathing of exhaled carbon dioxide trapped near an infant ’s airway has been suggested as a possible reason SIDS risk is higher when children sleep on their stomachs , in soft beds or without pacifiers .
Parents who worry that their child will be chilled by a fan should know that fans do not cool the air , they simply move air around .
A baby will only feel a chill if he or she is perspiring , doctors say .
Parents who use fans in a child ’s room should make sure to take normal safety precautions , keeping cords out of the way and making sure the fan ca n’t be knocked down by a toddler or pet .
Dr. Li said fan use can’t replace the other sleeping strategies for lowering SIDS , such as removing soft bedding and putting a baby on his or her back .
He notes that the gains shown in the study were for the whole group , but that the benefit appeared to be smaller when parents followed all of the A.A.P. guidelines .
However , even if a baby already is sleeping on the back , SIDS risk was lowered by about 16 percent , he said , although the trend was not statistically significant .
“ If parents wanted to do more to reduce the baby ’s SIDS risk , they can add a fan , ’’ Dr. Li said .
' THE PRIVATE SECTOR got us into this mess .
The government has to get us out of it . "
That 's Barney Frank 's story , and he 's sticking to it .
As the Massachusetts Democrat has explained it in recent days , the current financial crisis is the spawn of the free market run amok , with the political class guilty only of failing to rein the capitalists in .
The Wall Street meltdown was caused by " bad decisions that were made by people in the private sector , " Frank said ; the country is in dire straits today " thanks to a conservative philosophy that says the market knows best . "
And that philosophy goes " back to Ronald Reagan , when at his inauguration he said , ' Government is not the answer to our problems ; government is the problem . ' "
In fact , that is n't what Reagan said .
His actual words were : " In this present crisis , government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem . "
Were he president today , he would be saying much the same thing .
Because while the mortgage crisis convulsing Wall Street has its share of private - sector culprits -- many of whom have been learning lately just how pitiless the private sectors discipline can be -- they were n't the ones who " got us into this mess . "
Barney Frank 's talking points notwithstanding , mortgage lenders did n't wake up one fine day deciding to junk long - held standards of creditworthiness in order to make ill - advised loans to unqualified borrowers .
It would be closer to the truth to say they woke up to find the government twisting their arms and demanding that they do so - or else .
The roots of this crisis go back to the Carter administration .
That was when government officials , egged on by left - wing activists , began accusing mortgage lenders of racism and " redlining " because urban blacks were being denied mortgages at a higher rate than suburban whites .
The pressure to make more loans to minorities ( read : to borrowers with weak credit histories ) became relentless .
Congress passed the Community Reinvestment
Act , empowering regulators to punish banks that failed to " meet the credit needs " of " low - income , minority , and distressed neighborhoods . "
Lenders responded by loosening their underwriting standards and making increasingly shoddy loans .
The two government - chartered mortgage finance firms , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , encouraged this " subprime " lending by authorizing ever more " flexible " criteria by which high - risk borrowers could be qualified for home loans , and then buying up the questionable mortgages that ensued .
All this was justified as a means of increasing homeownership among minorities and the poor .
Affirmative - action policies trumped sound business practices .
A manual issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston advised mortgage lenders to disregard financial common sense .
" Lack of credit history should not be seen as a negative factor , " the Fed 's guidelines instructed .
Lenders were directed to accept welfare payments and unemployment benefits as " valid income sources " to qualify for a mortgage .
Failure to comply could mean a lawsuit .
As long as housing prices kept rising , the illusion that all this was good public policy could be sustained .
But it did n't take a financial whiz to recognize that a day of reckoning would come .
" What does it mean when Boston banks start making many more loans to minorities ? "
I asked in this space in 1995 .
" Most likely , that they are knowingly approving risky loans in order to get the feds and the activists off their backs . . .
When the coming wave of foreclosures rolls through the inner city , which of today 's self - congratulating bankers , politicians , and regulators plans to take the credit ? "
Frank does n't .
But his fingerprints are all over this fiasco .
Time and time again , Frank insisted that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in good shape .
Five years ago , for example , when the Bush administration proposed much tighter regulation of the two companies , Frank was adamant that " these two entities , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , are not facing any kind of financial crisis . "
When the White House warned of " systemic risk for our financial system " unless the mortgage giants were curbed , Frank complained that the administration was more concerned about financial safety than about housing .
Now that the bubble has burst and the " systemic risk " is apparent to all , Frank blithely declares : " The private sector got us into this mess . "
Well , give the congressman points for gall .
Wall Street and private lenders have plenty to answer for , but it was Washington and the political class that derailed this train .
If Frank is looking for a culprit to blame , he can find one suspect in the nearest mirror .

ASSET BUBBLES …. Should the Fed ( and other central banks ) try to prick asset bubbles before they get out of hand ?
In theory , sure , but as Mark Thoma points out , the problem is that we ’re not very good at recognizing bubbles in the first place : “ If we did n’t identify one of the largest bubbles in memory , and for the most part people did n’t , I ’m not confident we will be able to come to any kind of consensus about ‘ ordinary ’ sized bubbles before it ’s too late .
And if that ’s the case , waiting until we are certain we are observing a bubble will delay policy beyond the point where it can be helpful . ”
So what to do ?
Mark suggests a simple solution : the Fed already reacts to ordinary inflation , which is calculated as a complex weighted average of the prices of various goods and services .
When these prices rise faster than long - run fundamentals dictate — creating micro-bubbles , if you will — the Fed reacts by raising interest rates .
But the Fed ’s definition of inflation is incomplete :
There is one set of prices , however , that theory says ought to be part of the rate - setting decision , but they are missing .
And interestingly , and perhaps only coincidentally , the one set of prices that are not monitored and responded to just happen to be the place where bubbles erupt — asset prices .
But if we include these prices in the Fed ’s policy rule so that whenever asset prices rise the Fed responds by increasing the target interest rate , and if we weight the asset prices properly so that some prices , e.g. housing prices , receive more weight ( house prices are notoriously sticky , so theory says they ought to receive a lot of weight ) , then perhaps it ’s much less likely that a little bubble turns into a big bubble .
Asset price inflation will be stopped by increases in the federal funds rate ( and if it is n’t stopped by interest rate hikes , then other measures can be implemented ) .
With this approach , you do n’t have to debate whether a particular price run is a bubble or not ; if it is creating asset price inflation , then there will be an automatic response of the federal funds rate to temper the increase .
To me , not having to know if it is a bubble or not is an attractive feature .
This might just be an example of the recency effect on my part , but it sure seems as if the last couple of decades have produced more than the usual number of asset bubbles .
What ’s more , they ’ve become steadily more dangerous .
On a proportionate scale , the U.S. subprime bubble was n’t actually any bigger than either the Japanese or Swedish real estate bubbles of the late 80s / early 90s , but a combination of derivative speculation and the absolute size of America compared to either Sweden or Japan magnified it into a global disaster that previous bubblemeisters could hardly dream of .
So yes : it ’s time to pull our heads out of the sand and start giving asset inflation some weight in Fed anti-inflation policy .
It does n’t have to dominate Fed policy , it merely needs to be a factor in it .
Remember : the point is n’t to eliminate asset bubbles , only to try to tame them a bit .
I imagine Ben Bernanke has other things on his mind at the moment , but this seems like something worth a serious rethink once the current crisis calms down a bit .
Introduction
The ongoing collapse of the stock market and the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars managed by Wall Street investment banks illustrate the pitfalls and danger of free market capitalism facing the entire working population of the United States .
1 . The near bankruptcy of Social Security The attempt by the White House and leading Republican and Democrat congresspersons as recently as 3 years ago to ' privatize ' Social Security ­ essentially turning over the management and investment of trillions of dollars in Social Security funds to Wall Street ­ with the argument that private investors would earn more , would have led to the bankruptcy of the entire Social Security fund .
Privatization would have allowed the major private investment banks to speculate and leverage even riskier financial instruments with the disastrous results we are witnessing today .
While private pension funds go belly up ­ Social Security continues .
It is the private pensions , which have gone bankrupt ­ not the publicly managed Social Security fund , contrary to the experts and critics of Social Security .
Clearly the current private debacle argues for public control and management of pension programs .
2 . All the major private pension funds for public and private employees , including TIAA CREF , CALPERS and labor union pensions have lost anywhere between 23 % to 30 % since January and show negative growth over the past 5 years .
Clearly linking pension funds to the stock market has severely reduced the living standards of retirees , forcing many to remain in the labor force into their seventies and beyond or to sink into poverty .
Pensions linked to publicly funded productive activity would avoid the losses and risks embedded in investing in the stock market .
3 . The bipartisan strategic decisions to convert the US into a ' service ' economy as opposed to an advanced and diversified manufacturing economy is the root cause of the collapse of the US financial system and the emerging long - term recession .
From the 1960s onward , the political elite adopted policies that promoted finance , real estate and insurance , the so - called FIRE sectors which raised rents , redirected subsidies , provided tax concessions and subsidies , and destroyed and displaced industry .
The re-conversion of the FIRE economy back to a balanced manufacturing economy and welfare state , essential for reversing the collapse of the US economy , will require a major political upheaval .
4 . The massive flight of capital from productive sectors to FIRE was accompanied by the huge surge of capital overseas , making the domestic economy over dependent on ' services ' , particularly volatile and risky ' financial services ' and highly indebted consumers .
The conversion of the US from a diversified economy to a ' FIRE ' monoculture increased the probability of a general collapse if and when the financial / real estate market went under .
Recovery and sustained growth can only occur with the return of a diversified economy , the retention of capital from overseas flight and large - scale , long - term public investment and incentives for the productive and social service sectors .
5 . The pursuit of military - driven empire building at the expense of joint ventures and reciprocal trade agreements with countries with expanding markets , strategic energy sources and large populations and markets , created enormous budget and trade deficits and alienated potential sources of markets and strategic commodities .
Trillion dollar military expenditures in pursuit of prolonged , costly colonial wars ( without end ) , diverted funds from the application of technological advances and high - end manufacturing , which would have lowered costs and increased market competition .
Equally important , by shifting from market - driven domestic expansion to overseas military - driven conquest , the entire axis of economic power shifted from industrial to financial capital .
Finance capital essential to funding government budget deficits incurred through military expenditures , grew in influence ­ Wall Street replaced the steel - belt as the axes of power in Washington .
6 . The ascendancy of militarism and financial capital facilitated the increase of influence of a virulent power configuration promoting the regional hegemonic interests of a colonial - militarist state specifically , a previously marginal political lobby ­ the pro-Israel - Zionist power configuration ( ZPC ) .
The military - driven empire builders saw in the ZPC a strategic ally in pursuit of their global conquests ; the ZPC saw an open door to high office and multiple opportunities to promote Israel 's expansionist agenda through their influence in Congressional Committees , electoral campaigns and direct White House appointments .
The ZPC surge to the top echelon of power was aided and abetted by the increase of financial support they received by members in strategic positions in the most lucrative financial institutions .
The ZPC was an economic beneficiary of the speculative bubble : it was the massive infusion of financial contributions that allowed the ZPC to vastly expand the number of full - time functionaries , influence peddlers and electoral contributors that magnified their power ­ especially in promoting US Middle East wars , lopsided free trade agreements ( in favor of Israel ) and unquestioned backing of Israeli aggression against Lebanon , Syria and Palestine .
Economic recovery is contingent on ending budget busting military imperialism .
That will not happen unless there is a wholesale replacement of the political elite nurtured on the metaphysics of military - based global power .
No economic recovery is possible now or in the foreseeable future as long as the US Congress and executives provide trillion dollar bailouts to Wall Street 's insolvent speculators , bankroll 700 billion dollar budgets of ever expanding war spending and while Zionist power brokers dictate US Mideast policies .
The lessons of the past tell us a great deal about what paths we should and should n't take .
Social Security still exists precisely because the US public rebelled and defeated its proposed handover to Wall Street and it remained a publicly run program .
The financial system collapsed because the US economy ' specialized ' in a single crop ­ finance ­ at the expanse of a diversified productive economy .
The political system is totally discredited because it is run by a failed political elite which blatantly represents and acts on behalf of a few thousand financial oligarchs ; a couple hundred militarist oligarchs and a few dozen zealous Zionist organizations .
The ' power elite ' is only as powerful as it is able to manipulate , intimidate and beguile three hundred million plus US citizens into thinking that they are indispensable to their lives .
The overwhelming popular rejection of the privatization of social security and the Wall Street bailout suggests that the ruling oligarchy is not invincible .

A US strike on a Pakistani village near the Afghan border has killed at least nine people including suspected foreign militants , Pakistani sources say .
Initial reports said at least 20 people had died when an unmanned aircraft ( drone ) fired on the village in North Waziristan region .
But officials later talked of between nine and 12 deaths .
The US military has not confirmed any drone attacks and a Pakistani spokesman said there had been no intrusion .
North Waziristan is a stronghold of Islamic militants , including the Taleban and al - Qaeda , which US and other international troops are fighting in Afghanistan .
' Most were foreigners '
The missile was reportedly launched in the evening .
There is confusion over reports of a morning air strike .
The evening targeted a house in the village of Mohammad Khel , 30 km west of Miranshah , the main town in the region .
Pakistani intelligence officials quoted by Reuters news agency say a drone attacked Mohammad Khel at around 2130 ( 1530 GMT ) on Friday , killing at least nine people including foreigners .
Earlier , Pakistan 's Dawn TV and AFP news agency talked of at least 20 deaths in Mohammad Khel .
" Our reports suggest that around 20 suspected militants were killed ... " an unnamed " senior Pakistani security official " was quoted as saying by AFP .
" Most were foreigners , " the official added .
Dawn TV reported that 16 of the dead were foreign .
In the morning attack first reported by Reuters news agency , air strikes killed a child and two women in the North Waziristan village of Datta Khel .
However , the agency later quoted a Pakistani military spokesman , Maj - Gen Athar Abbas , as denying there had been any intrusion into Pakistani territory .
Instead , he said , an international operation had been launched against militants on the Afghan side of the border .
The evening attack killed at least 20 people , unnamed Pakistani security sources and the Dawn News television channel said .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia must stake its claim to a slice of the Arctic ’s vast resources , the secretary of Russia ’s Security Council said on Friday at an unprecedented session of the council held on a desolate Arctic island .
Russia , the world ’s second biggest oil exporter , is in a race with Canada , Denmark , Norway and the United States for control of the oil , gas and precious metals that would become more accessible if global warming shrinks the Arctic ice cap .
Underlining Russia ’s claims to the region , Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev assembled the defence and interior ministers and the speakers of both houses of parliament for the meeting on the Arctic island , Russian news agencies reported .
Russia , the world ’s biggest country , says a whole swathe of the Arctic seabed should belong to it because the area is really an extension of the Siberian continental shelf .
“ The Arctic must become Russia ’s main strategic resource base , ” Russian news agencies quoted Patrushev as saying .
The Council usually meets only in Moscow .
Patrushev , formerly Russia ’s powerful domestic spy chief , said competition from other Arctic powers was increasing and that Russia must strengthen transport links across its Arctic regions to drive development .
Canada , Norway , Russia , the United States and Denmark -- which governs Greenland -- all have a shoreline within the Arctic Circle , and have a 200 - mile ( 320 - km ) economic zone around the north of their coastlines .
Russian officials say they are entitled to a bigger share .
They base the claim on the contention that the Lomonosov ridge , a vast underwater mountain range that runs underneath the Arctic , is an extension of the Siberian continental shelf .
Under the United Nations Law of the Sea treaty , any state with an Arctic coastline that wishes to stake a claim to a greater share of the Arctic must lodge its submission with the U.N. ’s Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf .
Russian geologists estimate the Arctic seabed has at least 9 billion to 10 billion tonnes of fuel equivalent , about the same as Russia ’s total oil reserves .
Last year a submersible with a senior Russian lawmaker on board planted a Russian flag on the Arctic seabed .
The crew were greeted as heroes when they returned to Moscow .
Russian news agencies said the special Security Council session was held at the Nagurskaya base , Russia ’s most northerly border outpost .
The base is on Alexandra ’s Land , part of the Russian - controlled Franz Josef archipelago .
In yet another incredible interview with CBS News anchor Katie Couric Tuesday evening , Sarah Palin tackled a response to Couric ’s question as to whether climate change is “ man-made . ”
In a manner imitable only by Tina Fey , Palin gave this response after Couric pressed the question :
“ You know , there are man ’s activities that can be contributed to the issues that we ’re dealing with , with these impacts .
I ’m not going to solely blame all of man ’s activities on changes in climate because the world ’s weather patterns are cyclical , and over history we ’ve seen changes there . ”
It was what Palin said next that made me hit replay twice to make sure I heard her correctly :
“ But it kind of does n’t matter at this point as we debate what caused it .
The point is , it ’s real , we need to do something about it . ”
Well , at least the governor of Alaska sees that imperative as her state ’s permafrost is melting , glaciers are galloping backward , and polar bears are drowning – though the latter is no motivator for Palin , who opposes listing them as an endangered species so they ’ll pose no impediment to accelerating oil and gas development .
But to suggest that the cause of the unprecedented heating - up of our planet is irrelevant ?
How do we “ do something about it , ” as Palin suggests , if we do n’t understand it ?
How does she propose to deal with the effects without knowing from whence they ’ve come , and whether they may get worse ?
Just how does one address the impacts of global warming if we ca n’t acknowledge that human - induced carbon emissions are the major driver of the problem , along with 99 % of the world ’s reputable scientists studying the issue ?
While those scientists would not claim certainty about exactly how much of the earth ’s warming is human - caused , nor that they can precisely predict the effects to come , they speak with one voice in asserting a basic law of physics that seems to elude Palin : the Earth ’s temperature rises when greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap energy from the sun , and the more such gases are pumped into the atmosphere , the greater that heating effect will be .
Jim White , director of the Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research ( INSTAAR ) at the University of Colorado at Boulder , is a paleoclimatologist who does research on ice cores from the earth ’s polar regions .
The bubbles found in the ice core samples
White studies hold molecules of atmosphere from up to one million years ago , placing natural variability into an extended context and revealing that humans ’ fossil fuel burning over the past 150 years has raised CO2 levels higher than at any previous moment in that million - year timespan .
How can Palin , who notes that she heads the only state in the Arctic , not have even this most basic understanding of scientific principles and research methods that are explaining –- in frightening specificity — the destabilization of the earth ’s climate that is underway and is inevitably going to become more extreme ?
While the Bush Administration disdains science and seeks to keep it from influencing policy , Palin appears to disregard it altogether .
Maybe it is because she does n’t avail herself of the news and information sources that would force her to confront the science on climate change that says uh , yes , we have a problem and we do know what ’s causing it .
In tonight ’s interview with Couric , Palin could not name one specific newspaper or magazine she reads regularly , even when Couric asked the question three times .
This is the response I often get , ironically , from many journalism undergraduates I teach , but Palin , herself a journalism major , is running for vice president of the United States .
With three opportunities , surely she could have come up with a handful of convincing responses , even if she was posturing : the New York Times ?
No , too liberal .
The Washington Times , then ?
Wall Street Journal ?
How about the Anchorage Daily News , or the Juneau Empire when the Alaska legislature is in session ?
Newsweek , TIME ?
The Economist ?
National Review ?
Maybe
The Nation , to keep tabs on the spin those crazy liberals are contriving ?
Not one title came to Governor Palin ’s lips .
I want to give her the benefit of the doubt .
I want to believe she does follow the news –- even as a citizen — at least in her own state .
It ’s too embarrassing , with Palin on the world stage , to imagine otherwise .
But what we are seeing and hearing is a candidate whose anti-intellectualism would appear to trump even Dubya ’s – and in spades .
As Martin Luther King , Jr. , said , “ Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity . ”
The meltdown of the economy is very frightening .
The meltdown of the poles is , by any long - term measure , even more frightening .
And the prospect of a potential U.S. president , which all veeps are , who does n’t care why that ’s happening should up the fear quotient by at least another factor of 10 .

The photo of a giant vulture in Pakistan that died after eating the drug - tainted carcass of livestock .
A shadow has fallen over endangered giant vultures whose captive populations are too small to save the species .
Captive breeding colonies currently lack the genetic diversity to ensure survival for oriental white - backed vultures ( Gyps bengalensis ) in the wild , where the birds are dropping dead from feeding on drug - tainted meat .
The vultures boast a seven - foot wingspan and thrived in South Asia until the mid-1990s , when people started using an anti-inflammatory drug called diclofenac to treat arthritis - like symptoms in livestock .
Vultures that fed on the tainted carcasses of the animals died of kidney failure within a day or two .
" We know the problem , and we know the solution , " said Jeff Johnson , a biologist who conducted the research at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and is now at the University of North Texas in Denton .
" We just need to get diclofenac out of the environment and more birds into protection before it is too late . "
Their fate shares similarities with that of the California condors in North America , which are dying from lead poisoning after feeding on animals wounded or killed by hunters .
A shrinking population means less genetic diversity that can help species adapt to changing environments and climates or disease outbreaks .
The results could spell extinction for the giant vultures , despite the small captive breeding colonies in India and Pakistan .
Johnson and other researchers took genetic samples from old museum specimens of the giant vultures , and also collected recent feather and tissue samples from Pakistan 's last remaining wild breeding colony .
They then used computer simulations to determine that the number of vultures in captivity are not enough to maintain genetic diversity if wild populations go extinct – a likely case if people continue using diclofenac .
The loss of the giant vultures means fewer of nature 's garbage disposals to take care of uneaten livestock carcasses , which can become breeding grounds for bacteria and attract rabid feral dogs .
Such birds also have cultural value for the ancient Parsi religion of South Asia , which places deceased people on " Towers of Silence " for vultures to consume the remains .
The Hindu religion similarly reveres a vulture saint named Jatayu .
A conservation organization called the Peregrine Fund is working to try and save the giant vultures , but faces political , logistical and funding challenges in the vultures ' home countries .
" One of my goals with this paper , " Johnson said , " is to raise awareness of the problem and to increase political will in India and Pakistan to get this matter resolved . "
The study is detailed in the August issue of the journal Biological Conservation .
As we mentioned earlier in the week , EU commissioner McCreevy has been pushing for a longer copyright period for recorded performances .
This proposal has now passed the commission and is on the way to the parliament .
The upside however , is that the commission also aims to break music royalty monopolies .
The proposal , as we explained on Monday , is simple .
Extend copyright by 45 years in order to help ‘ struggling session players ’ earn money when they ’re old .
It seems a noble principle , and seems to be one that has convinced commissioners , in any case .
Perhaps the biggest incongruity that came from the announcements about it , is the feeling that session musicians , after being paid for the last 50 years for a single days work , need , all of a sudden to get another 45 years of payment .
You can bet the guy that put paper in the printer , that spat out the plans for McCreevy ’s house has n’t gotten paid for the last 50 years .
I ’ll bet the architect has n’t either .
However there is some reason that musicians , particularly jobbing musicians without the talent or ambition to head off on their own , should be paid for work of decades past .
The press materials put out by the commission tries to spin a brave face on this , with the likes of frequently asked questions , and number 7 asks the question we all have :
7 . Have performers not earned enough in the 50 years of protection ?
Most performers or singers and session musicians start their career in their early 20’s or even before .
That means that the current 50 year protection ends when they will be in their 70’s .
Current life expectancy in the EU stands at 75.1 years for men and 81.2 years for women and it is usual for persons to live well into their 80’s and 90’s .
Once protection has ended , performers no longer receive any income from their sound recordings .
For session musicians and lesser known artists this means that income stops when performers are retired – the most vulnerable period of their lives .
Alas , they have overlooked one important fact .
When someone retires , they cease getting paid for their work , since they are NO LONGER WORKING .
That is what retirement means .
If these session musicians have n’t worked since 1967 , they have been retired for the last 40 years .
Can we look forward to the Commissioner putting forth more legislation allowing nurses , gardeners , factory workers , mechanics , lorry drivers etc. to retire at 30 as well , safe in the knowledge that they will have their money woes cared for ?
However , there was not all doom and gloom as a result of today ’s meeting .
Two other proposals were also passed that were in some way , better for the artist AND the consumer .
First , part of the provision of extending the copyright is a requirement dubbed ‘ use it or lose it ’ .
It allows musicians to recover their copyrights from labels , if the label no longer wishes to market the recording .
If , after a year of no commercial availability , then the copyright will be rescinded .
This could be seen as an attempt to force recordings back into the market , but it will remain to be seen how effective this will be , or how it will be enforced .
If selling copies only at a small back street shop in a small town would qualify , for instance .
Of course , of greatest interest to us , is the actions to deal with the royalty collection groups .
Until now , they ’ve had country monopolies .
You play a song in public , and as long as it ’s under copyright , you ’ve had to pay a fee , regardless of the artist wishing the collection group to do so .
As the final shake up of copyright reform , the national franchises such groups have enjoyed ( like cable TV companies ) will be broken up , and artists will be able to sign with any agency they desire , bringing about , the commission hopes , competition .
However , none of this is binding yet , as it has to be approved by the Parliament .
It is worth noting however , that the proposal document lists the history behind the proposal .
That in 2004 , they issues a call for comments , and later had meetings with certain stakeholders .
Stakeholders in the EU context means businesses involved with the subject , not citizens .
Tellingly , the proposal itself lists where it seems to have gone wrong
Summary of responses and how they have been taken into account
Responses in favour of term extension came from performers ’ associations , the recording
industry , collecting societies , music publishers , performing artists and music managers .
Those
against term extension were telecoms , libraries , consumers and public domain companies .
The arguments of those against term extension were addressed in the analysis of impacts of
the various options .
â€¢ Collection and use of expertise
There was no need for external expertise .
From first looks at the impact study , it would appear that it only concerned itself with those who have created and published music in the 1950s and 1960s , and the cost difference between public domain , and copyrighted music .
A study that had it ’s conclusion written into the brief , and hardly representative of the real facts .
Euro - sceptics have disliked the EU for years , and with the increasing evidence that , in this case at least , commissioners are being lead by their wallets , rather than by common sense and the interests of Europe , it ’s a sad state of affairs for a body described as “ the only body paid to think European ” .
Clearly , ‘ European ’ is a euphemism for ‘ greedy ’ , or possibly ‘ short - sighted ’ .
I had to re-build Numpy because our cluster was upgraded and the Intel compilers and libraries were moved to a different directory .
This turned out to be a half - day affair of trial - and - error .
I learned a few important things , which I will try to list here :
Delete the numpy - 1.0.4 / build directory after every build attempt .
Doing “ python setup.py clean ” is not effective .
I kept getting errors about undefined symbols when I tried to “ import numpy ” on the Python command line .
It was looking for symbols in the old locations , even though I had just rebuilt the code using the new library locations .
It turned out that I needed to delete the build directory in order to force a complete bottom - up rebuild .

The use of “ setup.py ” from distutils is not well documented online .
The best thing to do is run “ python setup.py – help - commands ” to get a list of available commands .
Then run “ python setup.py < cmd > –help ” to get help for that specific command .
You can string commands together on the command line , as I will show in the example below .
When you test the new numpy , make sure you are not in the numpy - 1.0.4 directory !
If you are in the numpy source directory , when you import numpy , you will get the message “ Running from numpy source directory . ” and you will not be able to load any symbols from numpy .
in the numpy - 1.0.4 directory !
If you are in the numpy source directory , when you import numpy , you will get the message “ Running from numpy source directory . ” and you will not be able to load any symbols from numpy .
On 64 - bit architectures , you need to compile position - independent library code .
For some reason , distutils does not do this automatically , and the compilation will fail with an error similar to the following : relocation R_X86_64 _PC32 against `_various_library_symbols ' can not be used when making a shared object ; recompile with - fPIC Edit the file numpy - 1.0.4/numpy/distutils/intelccompiler.py .
Change the line cc_exe=” icc ” to cc_exe=” icc - fPIC ” ( line 11 in my version of numpy ) .
Make sure your LD_LIBRARY_PATH is pointing at the right location , or the compiled code wo n’t be able to find shared libraries .
Here is the command line I used to build numpy :
python setup.py config –library - dirs=/ apps/intel/mkl/10.0.1.014/lib/em64t/ –library-dirs=/apps/intel/cce/10.1.008/lib/ –compiler=intel –fcompiler=intel build –verbose install –home=~ > install_output.txt
Explanation : “ config ” is a command that accepts arguments –library - dirs to set the path where icc searches for shared libraries , –compiler to set the C compiler , and –fcompiler to set the Fortran compiler .
Technically , I think you can omit the “ build ” command .
The “ install ” command installs numpy , and the –home= ~ installs it in the user directory ( I do n’t have admin privileges on this machine ) .
Finally , > install_output.txt redirects the lengthy output to a text file for debugging purposes .
I hope this saves somebody some time !
Bacon Cinnamon Rolls

Is there nothing bacon can 't do ?
Mr B from Bacon Today came up with this ingenious idea while out shopping after picking up a tube of ready - to - cook cinnamon rolls .
BACON !
From : http://www.bacontoday.com/bacon-cinnamon-rolls/
While grocery shopping the other day I picked up a tube of ready - to - cook cinnamon rolls and thought hey , I wonder how these would taste with bacon .
As I read the back of the package I was reminded that the rolls are actually un-rolled when you remove them .
[ CONTINUED ]
I unrolled the first pastry and the length of the dough reminded me of something .
Could it be ?
Yes indeed .
Serendipity .
The unrolled pastry was nearly identical in size to a strip of bacon .
This was going to be interesting .
After assembling all the bacon cinnamon rolls I popped them in the pre-heated oven at 425 degrees for about 15 minutes .
I then pulled the rolls out of the oven and drizzled the icing upon them as directed .
Right from the first bite I knew we had a winner .
The Smasteâ¢ rating alone was a jaw - dropping 51.93 .
The entire house was filled with sugary , cinnamony , bacony aroma .
The taste was both sweet and salty , a perfect combination for a morning pick - me - up meal .
Highly recommended for any bacon lover !

Conclusion
Resistive touchscreen , huh Nokia ?
We 're intrigued , but certainly would n't say impressed .
Nokia claims the decision was made to appeal to the world market , particularly asian countries that prefer handwriting recognition to keyboards .
Hence the stylus input option .
It does n't ruin everything for those of us that would rather tap with our thumbs , but means pushing that much harder on the screen , and using the tips of your fingers when you type instead of the flat -- knocking off a good 5 wpm or so in the process -- we 'll talk more about software keyboards in the next section .
There 's also a plectrum ( guitar pick ) included that can hang from a wrist strap if you do n't want to smudge the screen and do n't feel like sliding out the stylus .
The LCD itself is certainly impressive , at 640 x 360 , but colors and brightness are n't complete knockouts .
Purists will enjoy the dull screen surface , which certainly cuts down on glare , but casual users often prefer glossy screens for watching movies , something this aspect ratio is very well suited to .
There 's a very , very loud speaker in the back .
It 's not the clearest thing in the world , but if you want to share a song or something with a friend , they 'll certainly hear it .
There 's also a 3.5 mm jack up top , right where it should be .
The 3.2 megapixel camera focuses well and takes great pictures in daylight -- indoors is likely a different story , as with most cameraphones , but there 's a rather powerful dual LED flash to help out with that .
All of this -- in addition to things like GPS , WiFi and a side - loading microSD slot ( there 's a free 8 GB card included ) -- are wrapped up into an elongated , chubby package , hence the Tube moniker .
We 'd hate to have something of its shape and thickness in a tight jeans front pocket on a regular basis , but we must admit that it 's very comfortable to hold and use with a single hand , something that can't be said for all touchscreen phones .
It 's S60 , so if you were hoping for something else you 'll be sorely disappointed .
Nokia 's done " just enough " to turn the traditional interface into a touchable one with version 5.0 , sizing up icons , adding finger - friendly buttons in lieu of traditional menu items and so forth .
What Nokia has n't quite figured out is consistency , requiring double taps in some places , single taps in others .
Scrolling through most lists requires dragging a scroll bar , pulling down as the list flies up , but the browser has touch and drag scrolling .
Nothing 's too frustrating or unreasonable , but this is no seamless experience .
What 's new is a touch - sensitive button above the screen that drops down the Media Bar for access to music , movies , photos , the browser and sharing .
Not life changing , but quite convenient .
There 's also a new home screen with a " Fav Four " of sorts across the top and little else .
Tap that friend , and you can get a quick look at recent calls , messages and even related RSS feeds .
Pretty neat if you 're a loner , but there 's no way to add more than four friends , or view similar info for your regular contacts that do n't make the cut .
Luckily , the traditional S60 home screen is also available .
For text input you have four options : handwriting , mini QWERTY keyboard , full screen QWERTY and alphanumeric keypad .
The first two are stylus - based ( that mini QWERTY is truly mini ) , while the other two are only available in landscape and portrait modes , respectively .
Like we said in the hardware end of things , the resistive touch means using the tips of your fingers instead of the pads , which we find a tad frustrating , but the keyboard in landscape mode is truly gargantuan , and after an hour or two of learning we 're guessing you could rattle off some pretty lengthly emails or Great American Novels .
Luckily , if you 're a T9 fan there 's nothing stopping you from keeping the phone in portrait mode and rattling off text messages with the touchable alphanumeric keypad , and the phone is frankly too narrow to work well with QWERTY in portrait .
The handwriting recognition looks good enough , but we revert to a 2nd grade writing level whenever we pick up a pen , so that stylus is staying firmly in its holster .
We 're not convinced the touchable browser is a step up over existing WebKit implementations on Nokia 's other handsets , since the tap to zoom function is slow and unreliable -- and no , you can't select text from web pages to copy and paste .
Panning around the page is also jittery , perhaps a tad worse than the G1 -- nobody has managed to pull off iPhone smooth yet in this department .
We were using a slightly early software build , so some of these problems might be fixed in the final version , but it was n't encouraging .
Still , there 's no denying the advantages of viewing the web on a 640 x 360 LCD .
We tested out an accelerometer - based driving game , but it was overly sensitive and no - fun - at - all -- though we 're guessing that would n't be a hard fix .
The graphics looked pretty good , though .
Movies are potentially this phone 's killer app , but you 'll have to do the conversion just right to get smooth playback at full resolution .
We did see some video shot with the phone ( that Sea World shot in the gallery ) and it looked pretty good .
If you have n't picked it up by now , Nokia is n't going after the power users here .
The phone will be marketed under Nokia 's " Live " banner , and really concentrates on the most basic communications -- calling and texting -- with a whole bunch of multimedia piled on top .
Nokia 's Comes With Music helps on that end of things , and the screen certainly helps with video , but this is no iPhone when it comes to to solid media integration or full - featured media player apps .
On the communication side , we 're sad to see Nokia almost burying some of its S60 advantages .
Everything 's still there , but Nokia did n't put the gruntwork in necessary to really take advantage a next - gen interface as it relates to keeping track of emails , social networking , IM and the correspondences of more than four people .
All that said , Nokia is n't claiming that the 5800 is the be all end all , is releasing it with a very aggressive price point ( €279 unlocked ) , and promises more where this came from .
The phone ships this fall in Europe , and will show up next year in the States without a carrier , though hopefully it picks up one soon -- a $ 50 subsidised price tag could turn this thing into a hit if the US carriers do n't sit on it too long .
From the Obama campaign :
“ It ’s now clear that John McCain would rather launch angry , personal attacks than talk about the economy or defend his risky bailout scheme that hands over billions in taxpayer dollars to the same irresponsible Wall Street banks and lenders that got us into this mess – a scheme that guarantees taxpayers will lose money .
While Barack Obama ensured that the rescue plan that passed Congress protects taxpayers and homeowners , John McCain ’s scheme has been panned by experts and observers from across the political spectrum , ” said Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor .
How clear ?
Watch the mob mentality and how McCain and Palin incite them with angry , personal attacks .
The Republican ticket is really out of control .
Scarily disturbing :

Meanwhile , the Dow dropped 679 points today .
You may recall this statement from the McCain campaign earlier in the week :
“ It ’s a dangerous road , but we have no choice , ” a top McCain strategist told the Daily News .
“ If we keep talking about the economic crisis , we ’re going to lose . ”
Well , most of us are talking about the economic crisis because it ’s getting worse .
John Sidney McCain III and Sarah Palin are too busy spewing bile to worry about the economy .
He said : " The public will be angered that the Home Office is seeking to take serious powers that should be appropriately applied by the police and encouraging them to be given not just to local councils , but also to private firms .

However , this is :
As spotted by the folks at a Rick Astley fansite , the source for the MTV splash page contains a hidden message in binary :

Britain ’s use of anti-terror laws to freeze the assets of failing Icelandic banks shows how such legislation can be abused for purposes other than originally intended , according to a UN independent expert .
“ It is indicative of the risks that measures that are originally inserted into legislation in the name of fighting terrorism may have a spillover effect into matters which have nothing to do with terrorism , ” said Martin Scheinin , the United Nations ’ special rapporteur on the protection of human rights in the fight against terrorism .
Last week Icelandic Prime Minister Geir Haarde accused London of “ bullying a small neighbour ” over funds frozen in the online bank Icesave , and threatened to take legal action in response .
Haarde was reacting to London ’s use of anti-terrorist laws to freeze the assets of failing Icelandic banks in Britain as it sought to protect the deposits of thousands of savers and public bodies .
The collapse of Icesave and its millions of pounds in deposits sparked a major diplomatic rift between London and Reykjavik , but the rhetoric has since been toned down .
Scheinin , a Finnish law professor , described the British move as “ a kind of in - built emergency regime ” used for purposes other than what it was originally intended .

The bruising roll call tally — coming on the heels of a weeklong revolt — had some GOP members asking privately whether John Boehner can hold on to his leadership post .
Boehner 's gamble : Could it cost him his job ?
No one risked more — for himself and for his party — on the bailout bill than House Republican leader John A. Boehner .
The result : He lost .

The Ohio Republican went all in for the $ 700 billion economic rescue package .
But when the gavel came down on the vote Monday , 133 of Boehner ’s 199 Republicans had gone the other way .
The bruising tally — coming on the heels of a weeklong revolt — had some GOP members asking privately whether Boehner can hold on to his leadership post .
Boehner said he ’s confident of his job , but the vote clearly took its toll .
The leader lost the support of some of his closest allies in the House — including Iowa Rep. Tom Latham and California Rep. Devin Nunes , two drinking buddies who helped lay the foundation for Boehner ’s political comeback in 2006 .
Another Boehner ally , Rep. Thaddeus G. McCotter of Michigan , physically turned his back on the leader during a tense closed - door GOP conference meeting Sunday night .
People who were in the room said McCotter left abruptly after Boehner told members not to attack one another .
Boehner tried to reach out to McCotter as he left .
McCotter kept walking .
“ I have some members who would do anything for me , and I talked to them , and it just killed them , absolutely killed them , when they told me they could n’t vote yes , ” Boehner told a small group of reporters after Monday ’s stunning floor defeat .
He said he did everything he could .
“ You ca n’t break their arms , you ca n’t put your whole relationship on the line , ask them to do something that they do not want to do and have that member regret that vote for the rest of their life , ” Boehner said .
“ Twenty years from now , nobody will care how anyone voted except those members .
You ca n’t do that .
You just can’t . ”
McCotter said Boehner will survive this vote .
“ You ca n’t abandon a man who at his core respects that you can have principled differences , ” McCotter said .
“ That ’s why all of us still love him . ”
From the beginning , Boehner has let his members do what they want .
He campaigned for the top job by telling Republicans he would not lean on them as his predecessor , former Texas Rep .
Tom DeLay , was wont to do .
But that long leash has been problematic at times — never , though , like it was on Monday .
Democrats were quick to dance on Boehner ’s grave on Monday — even though some of the Republicans who could someday replace him might be less gracious in negotiations than he has been .
“ I guess the Republican leadership is so weak John Boehner could n’t deliver 50 percent of the votes , ” Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey ( D - Wis. ) told a scrum of reporters shortly after the vote .
“ I thought these were big boys . ”
In the 10 days leading up to Monday ’s vote , Boehner worked quietly with Democrats and the White House to push a plan resembling what Treasury sent to Capitol Hill .
Along the way , he eased opposition by co-opting some of his leadership colleagues — tapping Republican Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri , a one - time challenger , to negotiate the deal with the Bush administration and Democrats in both chambers .
Boehner and Blunt , in turn , were able to work with the White House to persuade Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor — a potential Boehner rival — and Wisconsin Rep .
Paul Ryan to support the measure and speak in favor of it at a three - hour meeting Sunday night , despite the fact that the two had taken the lead in crafting a Republican alternative that solidified opposition to the underlying bill .
One member called it a “ master stroke ” on Boehner ’s part — but it was n’t enough .
After Monday ’s defeat , Boehner and other Republicans said a speech by Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) had cost some GOP votes .
In fact , some Republican aides began spreading word before her speech even ended that her remarks would turn the tide against them .
“ We had a dozen members that we thought that we had a really good chance of getting on the floor , ” Boehner told reporters afterward .
“ And all that evaporated when the speaker spoke . ”
Democrats dismiss the charge as nonsense — as a Pelosi aide said , members vote on bills , not speeches .
And the fact remains that a majority of Democrats stood with Pelosi while a majority of Republicans put distance between themselves and Boehner .
On some level , the problem was a lack of discipline .
House Republicans lack the clear leadership chain that characterized their tenure in the majority under DeLay .
The member - to - member relationships were much closer , so the whips typically had a better sense where votes stood before heading to the floor .
Boehner lacks the heft of former Speaker Dennis Hastert , who could always flip a few core votes in the final days before a tough roll call , and his party lacks any other heavy now that President Bush has only a few months left in office .
As the House prepared to vote Monday , Boehner delivered an astonishingly nonpartisan speech , telling the members who had already assembled on the House floor : “ I do n’t know that they get much tougher than this .
No one wants to vote for this . ”
When he finished , Boehner got more applause from Democrats than Republicans .
He strode up the aisle and back to the cloakroom to wait for the vote to begin .
During the vote , Boehner walked the floor by himself , gently jawboning wavering colleagues when he could .
But he did not seem to turn any votes , and the numbers grew steadily against him .
By Monday afternoon , staff members in the offices of Republican leaders were blaming one another for the failed vote .
Blunt said he had come to the floor thinking 75 Republicans would support the plan .
He was off by 10 — just short of the 12 that were needed to turn defeat into victory .
But Boehner told a different story .
He said that the GOP leaders never thought they ’d get more than 68 Republicans to support the bill — and that he sent Blunt to tell Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md. ) as much nearly two hours before the vote .
“ I sent [ Blunt ] down to talk to Hoyer , 11:30 , quarter to 12 , somewhere in that time frame , ” Boehner said .
“ We had a pretty good idea where we were , where we thought we could get to .
And Hoyer knew . ”
Boehner added : “ I did not talk to [ Hoyer ] , so I do n’t know what their conversation was .
[ Blunt ] and I had that conversation .
We talked about ‘ Should we just rise [ walk out ] ? ’
It would n’t have been good , but I thought it would have been better than this .
It really does n’t make any difference . ”
Democrats , for their part , said they assumed Blunt was lowballing his whip count to force Pelosi and the Democrats to line up more votes from their members .
In the end , as Pelosi and her team tried to flip votes in favor of the proposal , there was little Boehner or his Republican leadership team could do to entice those who voted “ no ” to switch their tally in support of the controversial measure .
“ Given the unpopularity of this whole concept , it ’s amazing that we got as many votes as we did , ” Boehner said .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story misquoted Boehner 's comments about his efforts to round up Republican votes .
Hypo Real Estate , Germany ’s second largest real estate lender , teeters on the verge of collapse .
The bank has a €400 billion balance sheet , which would make for a failure of a similar scale to Lehman ’s ( Hypo ’s footings are roughly $ 550 billion , while Lehman ’s were $ 660 billion as of its last balance sheet date ) .
Even though
Hypo it technically a bank , it is not a depositary institution , so rescuing it poses similar difficulties ( procedural and political ) to the authorities as Bear and Lehman did in the US .
The financial system cannot take another body blow of this magnitude .
The authorities had better patch this one up over the weekend , or we face even more credit market panic on Monday .
And if that were n’t an ugly enough picture , the failure to salvage Hypo has even broader ramifications .
From Marshall Auerbach , independent global strategist who does consultancy for a number of funds , and sometimes financial commentator , via e-mail :
The euro is in serious trouble with this Hypo Real Estate collapse .
Germans remain completely in denial .
The French get it , largely because their clever finance minister , Christine LaGarde , was educated at the University of Chicago and consequently understands something about markets .
Sarkozy , to his credit , appears to be listening to her .
The Germans are about to destroy EMU with their pigheadedness , and this will be the stuff of revolution , given that the German people were never consulted on abandoning the DM ( if there had been a referendum , the euro would have never been accepted in Germany ) and were forced to get rid of arguably the most successful post - war monetary institution , the Bundesbank .
The sop thrown their way was the stupid Stability and Growth Pact , designed by former German Finance Minister , Theo Waigel .
So he has hoisted the Germans and the euro zone on a German petard .
And that ’s made things worse !
No EU wide guarantee of deposits , no EU - wide prospect of a major fiscal stimulus and bye bye euro .
Ed Harrison of Credit Writedowns provided a translation from Der Spiegel .
Key sections :
HRE spokesman Obermeier did not want to comment Spiegel Online as to reports that the liquidity Gap of the bank could reach 70 to 100 billion euros by the end of 2009 .
He could only confirm that the consortium ’s original aid pledge had been withdrawn .
“ Why , we do not know , ” Obermeier said .
He said there were clear signals from the shareholders and Government , that they wanted to cooperate to find a solution to the problem … .
Sources close to [ Finance ]
Minister Steinbrueck said that the Finance Ministry had not been informed of the changed situation in advance by either Hypo Real Estate or the consortium of banks .
The government was informed only through ad hoc communication with HRE that the rescue package had collapsed .
“ We will now try to pick up the pieces on Sunday , ” the Ministry of Finance said .
The aid plan , agreed to one week ago , foresaw a short - term loan of 15 billion euros and a long - term refinancing of up to 35 billion euros in the second half of 2009 .
“ Die Welt am Sonntag ” had previously reported that Deutsche Bank had found in a study that HRE already clearly needed more money in the short - term .
According to the Deutsche Bank report , the company would lack up to 50 billion euros by the end of the year and even as high as 70 to 100 billion euros by the end of 2009 … .
“ If there is no solution when stock markets open on Monday morning , the company wo n’t make it two more days , ” said a banker .
This week , the Bundesbank and the BaFin had labeled the rescue operation which is now collapsing as vital to avoid “ severe disruptions to the financial markets ” .
In a letter from the Bundesbank and BaFin to Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck it was said that otherwise the German financial and economic system would be threatened by “ similar unforeseeable consequences ” as after the collapse of the U.S. financial group Lehman Brothers .
Bloomberg reports more clearly than Der Spiegel did that the bailout package may have been inadequate even over the coming weeks :
Hypo Real Estate ’s financing needs exceeded the bailout plan guarantee , Germany ’s Die Welt reported yesterday , citing unnamed people in the finance industry .
It will need 20 billion euros by the end of next week and 50 billion euros by the end of the year , according to the newspaper .
As much as 100 billion euros may be needed to shore up the bank ’s finances by the end of 2009 , Die Welt said .
Obermeier declined to comment .
The European Central Bank and the Bundesbank planned to contribute jointly 20 billion euros , and a group of unidentified banks another 15 billion euros .
The plan called for Hypo Real Estate to use 42 billion euros in assets , mostly debt owed by government borrowers , as collateral .
Further detail from Reuters :
Property lender Hypo Real Estate fought for its life on Saturday after German banks and insurers pulled out of a state - led 35 billion euro ( $ 48.5 billion ) rescue program stitched together only days ago .
The news is a fresh blow for the global financial system struggling to master an unprecedented crisis of confidence and poses a political challenge for the Berlin government , which has been fighting efforts to arrange a pan-European bank bailout .
“ The 35 billion euro rescue package promised to the Hypo Real Estate Group and extending into 2009 announced last week is currently withdrawn , ” the Munich - based real estate and public - sector lender said in a brief statement .
“ The intended rescue package involved a liquidity line to be provided by a consortium of several financial institutions .
The consortium has now declined to provide the line . ”
And Times Online :
John McCain is a maverick and Barack Obama is a postpartisan problem - solver .
But you would n't know it by looking at their economic plans .
Both candidates ' proposals faithfully reflect the traditional economic priorities of their respective parties .
That makes the track records of past Democratic and Republican administrations a very useful benchmark for assessing how the economy might perform under a President McCain or a President Obama .
The bottom line : During the past 60 years , Democrats have presided over much less unemployment and much more robust income growth .
The $ 52.5 billion plan Senator McCain announced last week includes $ 36 billion in tax breaks for senior citizens withdrawing funds from retirement accounts and $ 10 billion for a reduction in the capital gains tax .
Those are perks for investors , most of whom are relatively affluent .
( McCain is also proposing a two - year suspension of taxes on unemployment benefits , but that 's a fraction of the plan 's cost . )
He also favors broader tax cuts for businesses and wants to extend President Bush 's massive tax cuts indefinitely , even for people earning more than $ 250,000 per year .
McCain 's proposals reflect the traditional Republican emphasis on cutting taxes for businesses and wealthy people in hopes of stimulating investment – " trickle down " economics , as it came to be called during Ronald Reagan 's administration .
But will proposals of this sort really " stop and reverse the rise of unemployment " and " create millions of new jobs " as McCain has claimed ?
The historical record suggests not .
President Bush 's multitrillion - dollar tax cuts , which were strongly tilted toward the rich , could not prevent ( and may even have contributed to ) significant job losses .
On the other hand , when Bill Clinton raised taxes on affluent people to balance the federal budget ( while significantly expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for working poor people ) , unemployment declined substantially .
Under Clinton 's watch , 22 million jobs were created .
Prefer a broader historical comparison ?
In the past three decades , since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries oil price shocks of the mid-1970s and the Republican turn toward " supply side " economics , the average unemployment rate under Republican presidents has been 6.7 percent – substantially higher than the 5.5 percent average under Democratic presidents .
( The official unemployment rate takes no account of people who have given up looking for work or taken substantial pay cuts to stay in the labor force . )
Over an even broader time period , since the late 1940s , unemployment has averaged 4.8 percent under Democratic presidents but 6.3 percent – almost one - third higher – under Republican presidents .
Lower unemployment under Democratic presidents has contributed substantially to the real incomes of middle - class and working poor families .
Job losses hurt everyone – not just those without work .
In fact , every percentage point of unemployment has the effect of reducing middle - class income growth by about $ 300 per family per year .
And the effects are long term , unlike the temporary boost in income from a stimulus check .
Compounded over an eight - year period , a persistent one - point difference in unemployment is worth about $ 10,000 to a middle - class family .
The dollar values are smaller for working poor families , but in relative terms their incomes are even more sensitive to unemployment .
In contrast , income growth for affluent people is much more sensitive to inflation , which has been a perennial target of Republican economic policies .
Although McCain portrays Senator Obama as a " job killing " tax - and - spend liberal , the new $ 60 billion plan Obama unveiled last week also has a tax break as its centerpiece – a tax break specifically tailored to create jobs by offering employers a $ 3,000 tax credit for each new hire over the next two years .
Obama 's proposal would also extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks for those who remain jobless , as well as match McCain 's in suspending taxes on unemployment benefits .
Obama 's new proposal complements $ 115 billion in economic stimulus measures he had already announced , including $ 65 billion in direct rebates to taxpayers and $ 50 billion to help states jump - start spending on infrastructure projects .
All of this is squarely in the tradition of Democratic presidents since John F. Kennedy , who have relied on public spending and tax breaks for working people to stimulate consumption and employment during economic downturns .
These and other policies have produced not only lower unemployment under Democratic presidents but also more economic output and income growth .
In fact , over the past 60 years , the real incomes of middle - income families have grown about twice as fast under Democratic presidents as they have under Republican presidents .
The partisan difference is even greater for working poor families , whose real incomes have grown six times as fast under Democratic presidents as they have under Republican presidents .
Of course , past performance is no guarantee of what will happen when the next president takes office .
However , given the striking fidelity of both presidential candidates to their parties ' traditional economic priorities , the profound impact of partisan politics on the economic fortunes of American families over more than half a century ought to weigh heavily in the minds of voters .

Sarah Palin's wardrobe joined the ranks of symbolic political excess on Wednesday , alongside John McCain 's multiple houses and John Edwards ' $ 400 haircut , as Republican expressed fear that weeks of tailoring Palin as an average " hockey mom " would fray amid revelations that the Republican Party outfitted her with expensive clothing from high - end stores .
Cable television , talk radio and even shows like " Access Hollywood " seemed gripped with sartorial fever after campaign finance reports confirmed the Republican National Committee spent $ 75,062 at the Neiman Marcus store on Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis , $ 49,425 at Saks Fifth Avenue , and $ 92 for a romper and matching hat with ears for baby Trig at Pacifier , a Minneapolis baby store , in September for Palin and her family .
Advisers to Palin said Wednesday that the purchases -- which totaled about $ 150,000 and were classified as " campaign accessories " -- were made on the fly after the governor of Alaska was chosen as the Republican vice presidential candidate on Aug. 29 and needed new clothes to match climates across the 50 states .
They emphasized , too , that Palin had not spent time on the shopping , and that other people made the decision to buy such an array of clothes .
Yet Republicans expressed consternation publicly and privately that the shopping sprees would compromise Palin 's standing as McCain 's chief emissary to working - class voters whose salvos at the so - called cultural elite often delight audiences at Republican rallies .
That possibility was brought to colorful life , for instance , on ABC's " The View , " as co-host Joy Behar noted the McCain campaign 's outreach to blue - collar workers -- such as an Ohio plumber who recently chided Sen.
Barack Obama over taxes -- after another co-host , Elisabeth Hasselbeck , defended the expenditures .
" I do n't think Joe the Plumber wears Manolo Blahniks , " Behar said .
Oh boy , will give you details when they show up in the media .

Update 2:00 AM .
From Bloomberg :
Indonesia ’s stock exchange halted share - market trading for the first time in eight years after a 10 percent plunge in the benchmark index .
Trading will remain suspended until further notice , the exchange said in an e-mailed statement .
Trading was last halted in September 2000 when a car bomb damaged the exchange building and killed 15 people .
Exchange President Erry Firmansyah could n’t be immediately reached on his mobile phone to comment .
“ People are panicking , ” said Suherman Santikno , head of research at Jakarta - based PT Batavia Prosperindo Sekuritas which manages about $ 573 million in assets .
“ With uncertainty in the global economy , it ’s best to hold cash . ”
The Jakarta Composite index was down 10 percent when the suspension came into effect .
The measure is down 21 percent this week , the worst weekly drop since at least April 1983 , data compiled by Bloomberg showed .
The rupiah declined 0.4 percent to 9,603 per dollar , trading near its lowest level in three years .
Credit - default swaps on Indonesia ’s government debt widened 75 basis points from Oct. 6 to 525 in morning trade today , ICAP Plc prices show .
That means it costs $ 75,000 more a year to protect $ 10 million of the country ’s debt from default for five years .
Click to view My son has become completely enamored with LittleBigPlanet .
Which is n't that surprising .
But what is surprising is what about the game that 's enthralling .
It 's not the play that has him begging to boot up the Playstation 3 every night , but the creation .
Tristan has become a indie developer and he does n't even realize it .
He spends hours sitting in front of the television adding to his level , figuring out ways to torture gamers , defending his creation .
Last week he called me to the television for a play through .
At one point I decided to break from the obvious path and drop down to the floor of his level , far from the beaten path .
Once there I realized I could n't get back up .
I 'm stuck , I said .
Oh , I 'm going to add scorpions there dad .
Watching his interest in game development grow , I suggested that he write up a letter asking for advice in game design , which I would then email off to a few developers I know .
Hit the jump to read what David Jaffe , Matrk Pacini and Cliff Blezinski had to tell himTristan 's Letter
Hi my name is Tristan .
I am 7 . I am making a level for LittleBigPlanet .
I have already started my level and it has flames .
It has a giraffe with a tree .
It has crabs .
It 's really fun .
When I 'm finished I want it to have flames everywhere and some ghosts in it .
I want it to be really scary .
I was thinking of making the whole level underground .
I also want people to have to jump a whole bunch .
I think I will call it The Tristan Level .
Do you have advice for me about building it ?
Thanks ,
Tristan

David Jaffe - founder EatSleepPlay : God of War
Tristan , hey !
Well , it sounds like you are off to a great start with your level .
Very eager to give it a play .
I love to jump !
As for advice , I would say the following : a- make sure you give the player lots of rewards for trying cool things ... little treasures and rewards for exploring your map , battling all the ghosts , helping the giraffe reach some fruit on the tree , whatever .
Just make sure the player feels like you have gone in before he / she got there and set up lots of cool surprises for him .
The player is looking to YOU to make sure they have a good time .
Do n't let them down .
b- at the same time , if you are not having fun , then change your level .
You should do creative work mainly for you .
So make sure you enjoy your level first and foremost , otherwise , what is the point ?
c-
Tell your dad to make commenting on his website easier .
It really is a right pain in the fucking ass .
I hope he will not show you those bad words .
d- put in more jumping .
Man , I love to jump !
Good luck on The Tristan Level , man !
That is so cool that your are enjoying the game !
Looking forward to your creation !

Hey Tristan !
I heard you are building a level for LBP and so far it sounds really cool !
( who would n't like fire and giraffes )
If you are looking for an easy way to make your level as fun as possible , I wrote up a little level design tidbit that was often used when we were building the environments for the Metroid Prime series .
I hope you find it useful !
Try to not show the answer before the player knows the question –
If you have a simple puzzle in your level , do not show the player the solution before they know what they are trying to solve .
Here is a simple example :
You have fire in your level , right ?
Well , imagine you had a pit of fire that the player could not cross .
( It is too long to jump safely across )
The only way to cross it is to shut it off by pressing a button .
Well , where do you put that button ?
If you put the button right in front of the fire pit , ( See ‘ A ' below ) the player will probably push the button and shut off the flames before knowing that 's what he needed to do .
One place you may want to put the button is above the fire pit , on a platform that the player can reach .
( See ‘ B ' below )
That way , the player is more likely to run into the pit and realize he can not get across .
When he finds the button above the pit , he will probably feel more rewarded because he figured it out on his own .
This is the basic principle behind building good , rewarding puzzles .

The Senate is ignoring the House of Representatives and will be voting tomorrow on passing the bill , as just reported by Lou Dobbs on CNN ...
The bailout package adds new provisions - including raising the FDIC insurance cap and includes a " Mental Health Parity " provision , which would require health insurance companies to cover mental illness at parity with physical illness .
Because the bill must originate in the House , the Senate is attaching the rescue plan to a bill that deals with renewable energy tax incentives .
This would allow the Senate to vote before the House .

“ Al Qaeda in Iraq will be recruiting them , ” he said .
Wariness as Walls Fall
Each slab is the shape of a tombstone and the height of a double - decker bus .
Assembled on the streets of Baghdad , the walls stretched for miles and redefined the city ’s look and feel .
As they are removed , the bullet - pocked slabs are stacked in large storage zones waiting to be used elsewhere or moved to a central depot .
The walls are not coming down in all , or even most , Baghdad districts .
They still surround the Green Zone , the once notorious airport highway , government buildings , checkpoints and entire neighborhoods like the Sunni enclave of Adhamiya .
But they have already been dismantled in some parts of the city .
At a recent ceremony during the closing days of Ramadan , Sunnis from the Fadhil District , east of the Tigris River , joined with Shiites from adjoining Abu Saifeen to celebrate the removal of sections of a 15 - month - old American - built wall that had divided their neighborhoods .
A checkpoint operated by Awakening groups from both neighborhoods now stands in the gap .
Col. Craig Collier , commander of the Third Squadron , 89th Cavalry Regiment , Fourth Brigade Combat Team , 10th Mountain Division , said that in the past year , relations between Awakening groups in the two areas had “ gradually gotten better and better , until now , you ’re at the point where they ’ve taken the wall down and the two sides get together a lot . ”
He added , “ They ’ve been playing soccer . ”
A nearby square on Kifah Street was the scene of a huge car bomb that killed 140 people in April 2007 .
It serves as a bus terminal , where buses are still barricaded behind blast walls .
A billboard depicts a collage of photos of drivers killed in the bombing .
“ If you see my photo , say a prayer for me , ” reads the caption .
Here , opinion about the walls was divided .
Haider Falah , an Awakening guard , shrugged off past clashes between those in Abu Saifeen and Fadhil .
“ We are all Iraqis , ” he said .
But Alaa Hadi , 28 , a watermelon seller , lost his brother in an earlier bombing that killed 137 people and destroyed much of the market .
Fearing outsiders , he is against any walls coming down .
At a town hall meeting at in Lakeville , Minn. , John McCain took back the microphone from Gayle Quinnell when she said she Barack Obama was \ " an Arab . \ "
Who 's in control of McCain 's campaign ?
John McCain ’s campaign is pretty much a shambles right now .
If you do n’t believe me , just listen to John McCain .
His chief goal these days is calming down his crowds , not firing them up .
Advertisement
And that is an honorable thing to do .
It may not be a winning thing to do .
But it is honorable .
Sarah Palin , once seen as a huge plus to the ticket , is now increasingly emerging as a liability .
Forget that an independent legislative panel found Friday that she had abused her power and violated ethics laws as governor of Alaska .
Forget that with the possibility of Palin being a heartbeat away from the presidency , McCain gives up the argument that his ticket represents experience and a steady hand on the tiller .
The real problem for McCain is that Palin is running a separate — and scary — campaign that does not seem to be under anybody ’s control .
She storms around the country saying : “ Our opponent ... is someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect , imperfect enough that he ’s palling around with terrorists who would target their own country . ”
She also says : “ This is not a man who sees America as you see America and as I see America . ”
Get the drift ?
Obama is not only different , not only an alien incapable of loving his country , he is an actual friend of terrorists who would attack America .
The great benefit of putting Palin on the ticket , we were told , is that it would excite the Republican base .
Maybe it will .
But the Republican base has never been smaller .
And it is insufficient to carry the McCain - Palin ticket to victory .
To win , the Republican ticket must attract a significant number of independent voters , swing voters and even some Democrats .
Do Sarah Palin ’s attacks really help achieve that ?
Her attacks certainly appeal to some .
Cries of “ traitor ” and “ terrorist ” and “ off with his head ” are heard at Republican rallies when Obama ’s name is mentioned .
And Palin is not the only one who is fear - mongering .
Karen Tumulty of Time magazine was invited by the McCain campaign to visit its operations in Virginia on Saturday .
So Tumulty was there when Virginia Republican Party Chairman Jeffrey M. Frederick “ climbed atop a folding chair to give 30 campaign volunteers who were about to go canvassing door to door their talking points — for instance , the connection between Barack Obama and Osama bin Laden . ”
“ Both have friends that bombed the Pentagon , ” Frederick said .
“ That is scary . ”
At Tumulty points out , “ It is also not exactly true — though that distorted reference to Obama ’s controversial association with William Ayers , a former ’60s radical , was enough to get the volunteers stoked .
‘ And he wo n’t salute the flag , ’ one woman added , repeating another myth about Obama .
She was quickly topped by a man who called out , ‘ We do n’t even know where Sen .
Obama was really born . ’
Actually , we do ; it ’s Hawaii . ”
( And , actually , John McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone , a location at least as exotic as Hawaii . )
This is scary stuff .
And you know who is getting scared by it ?
John McCain .
When a crowd member said at a town meeting in Lake­ville , Minn. , on Friday that he feared what would happen if Obama were elected , McCain said that Obama is “ a decent person and a person that you do not have to be scared of as president of the United States . ”
The crowd booed .
Why would n’t it ?
McCain says there is nothing to fear from Obama , while McCain ’s running mate says Obama pals around with terrorists who target America .
Is there a little confusion here ?
At the same event in Minnesota , a woman in the crowd told McCain that she does n’t trust Obama because “ he ’s an Arab . ”
Taking the microphone from her , McCain said , “ No , ma’am .
He ’s a decent family man , a citizen , that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues , and that ’s what this campaign is all about . ”
Maybe that is what McCain would like his campaign to be all about .
But others are telling him to forget that “ fundamental issues ” stuff .
The polls stink , they are telling him .
The voter registration numbers stink .
And Obama may have the most effective ground organization in Democratic history .
So how can McCain close the gap ?
There is a playbook that tells him how .
It is a playbook that the Republicans have used for a number of cycles now : Promise low taxes , promise to better defend the country against its enemies , and then attack , attack , attack .
Willie Horton .
Sighs and lies .
Swift boat .
Attack .
Just do it .
But McCain is hesitating .
“ If you want a fight , we will fight , ” McCain told that crowd in Minnesota .
“ But we will be respectful . ”
The crowd booed again .
“ I do n’t mean to reduce your ferocity , ” McCain said .
“ I just mean to say you have to be respectful . ”
Is that possible ?
There are those whispering in McCain ’s ear that if he gets into the gutter , he can get into the White House .
Ads are not enough , they tell him .
He must launch the attacks personally and without reservation .
But honor is still an important word to John McCain .
He would like to win the presidency and retain his honor .
Some tell him he can not do both .
At this point , however , he is trying .

BBC News , Kruje , Albania
Qamile wears the traditional clothing of an Albanian man Almost eight decades on , Qamile Stema still remembers clearly the day she decided to give up her long hair and dresses in order to become the male head of her household .
" My father had died and the door of our house was shut because there were no more men in the family .
" So I cut my hair and from that day on kept the door of the house open , " she says grandly .
Dressed in a baggy black suit and waist - coat , with a small fez hat perched on cropped white hair , Qamile has all the trappings of a typical Albanian old man .
But hearing the 88 - year - old 's high - pitched voice and seeing her smooth but deeply - lined face quickly dispelled any doubts about her true identity .
I think it 's better to be barren like me , than to have children that bring grief to you , I 've had a good life
Qamile Stema
" People respect me , and shake my hand , as they would with a man ; but when they hear my voice and see my face they know I 'm a woman , " Qamile says .
" And they still say to me , ' how you 've been ' - just as they would say to a man ! " she adds with a broad smile .
Qamile is one of just a handful of " sworn virgins " still alive in Albania : women , typically from poor rural communities in the north of the country , who opted to change their status , though not their sex .
According to the sociologist , Zydi Dervishi , who has interviewed more than 20 such women , some took such a life - changing decision in order to avoid an unwanted marriage ; others , to make up for the absence of a male heir in the family .
He says that in Albania 's historically patriarchal society , a family without a son or a father figure was often considered leaderless .

Advertisement Sitting in the afternoon sun on the patio of a small brick house , three hours north of the capital , Tirana , Qamile relates how her father 's death had left her mother alone with just daughters .
Qamile , the youngest , decided that she would take her father 's place .
She says that no one forced it upon her , and that some of her relatives later tried to persuade her to swap back .
But , Qamile says , as the self - proclaimed " man " in her family , she enjoyed privileges beyond the reach of other women .
She earned the right to carry a rifle , as well as the duty to defend family honour ; she could work and smoke with the other men in the village and even pray with the men at the local mosque .
Traditional punishment
At weddings and funerals , she would always hang out with the other men and came to be seen as one of the village elders .
" Even now she 's always sought out in the village for advice of what 's good and bad , " one of her relatives says .
While Qamile clearly seems at ease in male company - laughing and joking with men as she talks about her life - other " sworn virgins " did not have such a positive experience , according to Mr Dervishi .
He says that some of the women he has spoken to - almost all now in their 80s - swapped roles when young in order to avoid their families being " punished " under age - old customs for refusing to marry .
Tradition , particularly prevalent in the north of Albania , dictated that turning down a suitor could lead to the man 's family exacting revenge on the girl 's father or brother .
" Sworn virgins " are part of Albania 's fading folklore
The only way to settle the dispute without bloodshed , according to the same tradition , was for the girl to declare herself a virgin for life and assume the role of a man - and thus never marry .
Such practices were frowned upon during the 40 - year period of communist rule in Albania , said Mr Dervishi , allowing some of these girls to swap back .
Those who remained in their assumed roles , however , were often deeply unhappy , he says .
" They were neither accepted wholly by men , nor accepted wholly by women . "
Post - communist democracy , migration and the influence of the West has radically changed Albania and the position of women in society .
The sworn virgins are now seen as part of the country 's fading folklore , said Mr Dervishi .
Yet Qamile , who has rarely ventured out of her northern village on account of her arthritis , says she has no regrets about having taken such a momentous decision .
" I 'm happier to have stayed as a man because these days children leave home and then you are all alone .
" I think it 's better to be barren like me , than to have children that bring grief to you .
I 've had a good life . "

“ In the middle of the taping Dave got word that McCain was , in fact just down the street being interviewed by Katie Couric .
Dave even cut over to the live video of the interview , and said , “ Hey Senator , can I give you a ride home ? ”
Earlier in the show , Dave kept saying , “ You do n’t suspend your campaign .
This does n’t smell right .
This is n’t the way a tested hero behaves . ”
And he joked : “ I think someone ’s putting something in his metamucil . ”
“ He ca n’t run the campaign because the economy is cratering ?
Fine , put in your second string quarterback , Sarah Palin .
Where is she ? ”
“ What are you going to do if you ’re elected and things get tough ?
Suspend being president ?
We ’ve got a guy like that now ! ”

Below are two photos — one of Barack Obama as an adult and one of a young Obama and his Grandfather , Stanley Dunham ( found here and here ) .
I tried a little experiment in class .
I put up the photo of adult Obama and I had my students make a list of what characteristics made him identifiably Black , in their view .
Every one of them put on their list his nose , lips , and hair , and several made comments about his ears or just that “ the combination of all his facial features ” was “ clearly ” Black .
Then I brought up the photo of young Obama and his grandfather alongside it :
It led to a really interesting discussion .
Because my students think of Obama as Black , they saw all his features through that racial lens .
It was obvious to them that he had “ Black ” facial features .
After viewing the photos next to one another , they talked about how the two men look very similar , but their facial features seem “ clearly ” Black on one person and “ clearly ”
White on the other because we ’re used to believing that Blacks and Whites look very different .
Because they believe in racial differences , they see them .
This activity seemed to really help students grasp what I meant when I talked about the way we identify things as racial differences when they ’re really variations that occur in many different groups that we swear are physically distinct from one another .
It ’s interesting because I ’d halfway expected my students to argue that Obama does n’t “ really ” look Black at all — that they would say his skin color and hair , perhaps , were identifiable as African American , but that they would point out that he ’s half - White and argue that in fact he does n’t have stereotypically Black or White features .
I mean , that would made sense , right ?
But I ’ve tried this with three classes now , as well as several random individuals I ’ve subjected to it to see if it might work as a class activity , and no one has yet failed to identify a number of the facial features Obama and Dunham share as specifically African - American features when they see them on Obama .
What a great example of racialization and the social construction of race .

ACLU : Bush admin tried to create ' Gitmo inside the US ' Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday October 8 , 2008
Print This Email This
The US military was using the same procedures employed at the controversial Guantanamo Bay prison at other facilities inside the United States where US citizens and legal residents were detained , according to documents released Wednesday .
At least one Navy officer was concerned that a detainee was being slowly driven insane by the policies , which prohibited detainees from having items such as shoes or socks , according to 91 pages of e-mails between officers at military brigs in Virginia and South Carolina released Wednesday by the American Civil Liberties Union .
" These documents are the first clear confirmation of what we 've suspected all along , that the brig was run as a prison beyond the law .
There was an effort to create a Gitmo inside the United States , " Jonathan Hafetz of the ACLU 's National Security Project in New York told the Associated Press , using the slang word for the U.S. naval facility in Cuba .
A pdf of the heavily redacted e-mails can be downloaded here .
The ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act request along with the Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School to obtain the documents .
The obtained e-mails apparently were exchanged between brig officers and military higher - ups between 2002 and 2004 .
They discuss detentions of Yaser Esham Hamdi , Jose Padilla , both of whom were US citizens at the time , and Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , who was a legal resident in the country when he was detained .
 Guantánamo was designed as a law - free zone , a place where the government could do whatever it wanted without having to worry about whether it was legal ,  said Jonathan Freiman , an attorney with the Lowenstein Clinic at Yale .
 It didnt take long for that sort of lawlessness to be brought home to our own country .
Who knows how much further America would have gone if the Supreme Court hadnt stepped in to stop incommunicado detentions in 2004 ?
The detainees apparently were not allowed to speak to family members or lawyers for years , and the e-mails suggest that Guantanamo standard operating procedures were being employed in the domestic brigs .
An officer asked what to tell detainees about their legal status and received little guidance .
" Best not to discuss his status at all with him , " wrote an unidentified superior , presumably a Pentagon or military lawyer .
" Realize that 's tough on a human level but realize anything you say becomes statement of US govt , at least potentially .
Safest and honest answer is ' I do n't know , sorry . ' "
The documents also include " weekly updates " the brig officers were required to send on the treatment of the detainees , but the ACLU notes that the updates on Padilla and al - Marri were not released because the Navy said the documents were either being withheld or were missing .
That the missing updates cover a period " during which the two were being detained incommunicado and interrogated , " the ACLU says , suggests " the possibility that Guantánamo - like interrogations were taking place . "
When RealNetworks debuts new DVD - to - PC copying software Monday morning at DEMOfall 08 , one major selling point will be that users can sleep soundly knowing for the first time that their homemade copies of commercial movies are perfectly legal .
Maybe .
( Update , Sept. 30 : The legal battle begins . )
The motion picture industry , which does n't even like to see the words " DVD " and " copying " in the same sentence , says it 's not ready to endorse that blanket assurance from RealNetworks , as it learned of the product only late last week .
The industry has fought such DVD copying in the past , last year losing a drawn - out courtroom battle with an upstart maker of high - end media servers , a ruling one losing attorney suggested -- warned , actually -- would " open the floodgates " to exactly the type of inexpensive DVD copying system RealNetworks is unveiling today .
The industry has appealed that court ruling .
Called RealDVD , the $ 50 application from RealNetworks ( $ 30 introductory price ) may make digital movie collections more accessible , portable and easier to manage ... in addition to causing consternation in the multibillion - dollar DVD industry .
( Update , Sept. 30 : Network World 's Keith Shaw reviews the product here . )
" Unlike existing consumer applications on the market today , RealDVD is licensed DVD software that saves a secure copy of a DVD to the hard drive without removing or altering the CSS encryption , " says RealNetworks in a press release preceding Monday 's onstage demonstration in San Diego .
Network World 's biannual DEMO event , the technology industry 's preeminent showcase for startups and new products , runs through Tuesday with 72 exhibitors slated to strut their stuff .
RealDVD needs 10 to 40 minutes to copy a flick and eats up 4 to 8 gig per saved movie , according to RealNetworks .
Portable storage devices will be required to augment hard drives for users who want to collect more than a handful of movies .
" Saved DVDs are then encrypted and locked again to make sure they cannot be shared or stolen , " the company says .
Users may purchase additional licenses in order to view their collections on up to 4 additional machines for $ 20 per machine .
While RealNetworks emphasizes the convenience features of RealDVD , it 's the potential legal issues that will earn the product extra attention .
The DEMO show book puts it this way : " If you 're feeling a little guilty about the DVD library you ripped to your hard drive , listen up : RealNetworks will help you go legit . "
At least that 's the claim from the company 's FAQ about the product :
Is it legal to save movies with RealDVD ?
Yes , provided that you are the owner of the original DVD and you use your saved copy solely for your personal use .
Now raise your right hand ...
Asked if the movie industry had any problems with the copying enabled by RealDVD , RealNetworks spokesman Ryan Luckin told me Friday afternoon that his company had just begun informing industry officials about the product , which despite any questions on that score was to be available for download Monday at www.realdvd.com.
" They seem to be OK with it , " he added .
Not so fast , says the Motion Picture Association of America .
" We really just became aware of this in the past 24 hours , " Elizabeth Kaltman , a spokeswoman for the MPAA , told me late Friday .
" We have nothing else to say at this time . "
There was also nothing in her tone to suggest that the MPAA 's acquiescence is a mere formality .
According to Luckin , RealNetworks ' confidence in the legal foundation of RealDVD is based in part on a courtroom victory scored in March 2007 by high - end home - entertainment center maker Kaleidescape , which had been sued by the DVD Copy Control Association .
The group appealed that decision in December .
The ruling in favor of Kaleidescape was hailed by the victor as a triumph for innovation and consumer rights , according to a story in EE Times :
" We will see more competition now , " said ( Kaleidescape founder and CEO Michael ) Malcolm .
" That 's probably the biggest loss in the eyes of the DVD CCA .
They will see a lot more consumer companies going into this kind of product . "
In closing arguments ( the DVD CCA 's attorney ) warned that a ruling in favor of Kaleidescape " could open the floodgates to copycats .
Prices could come down to that of a laptop for products that are not as elegant as Kaleidescape 's but have the same basic functionality . "
Elegance is in the eye of the beholder , but there 's no doubt that day has arrived -- and at a lot less than the price of a laptop .
What remains to be seen is whether the movie industry will continue to fight what has so far been a losing battle .
Losers are everywhere .
It ’s a scientific fact and the silver screen has had its fair share over the years .
Last week How To Lose Friends and Alienate People was released in the cinemas , putting another loser on the big screen in the form of Simon Pegg ‘s Sidney Young .
In a move that ’s totally non-affiliated with that film , we here at hecklerspray have decided to compile together a list of a bunch of losers , that one way or another , have given us greats amount of joy over the years in the cinema .
Maybe it ’s because we ’re better than them , maybe it ’s because it gives us hope or maybe they are just too cool in a world that does n’t appreciate them , either way , here we go …
10 . Ben Stone – Knocked Up
A relatively new loser , Ben Stone managed to be a perfect example of what we love about these guys :
Funny , likeable , stupid and completely oblivious to it all .
The smartest thing he managed to do was get an incredibly hot chick pregnant and therefore locking her down for life .
Well played , old friend .
“ If any of us get laid tonight , it ’s because of Eric Bana in Munich . ” – Ben Stone
9. Harry Dunne and Lloyd Christmas – Dumb and Dumber
Pumpkin haircut , chip on his front tooth , sellotaping a dead bird ’s head onto its body and selling it to a blind kid .
All of these are reasons why we love Lloyd Christmas , the stupidest idiot in cinema – or should that prestigious title go to Harry Dunne , who drives around in a giant dog car all day long ?
It ’s a close call but these losers manage to screw up every chance they get but they make for one of the funniest modern comedy duos .
“ I ca n’t believe we drove around all day , and there ’s not a single job in this town .
There is nothing , nada , zip ! ” – Harry
“ Yeah !
Unless you wanna work forty hours a week . ”
– Lloyd
8. Milton Waddams / Peter Gibbons – Office Space
This pair of losers both work in the colourful world of Initech , where each day is exactly the same as the last .
Peter has no delusions about his position in life and just wants nothing more than to do nothing everyday for the rest of his life .
Milton is worse for the fact he loves his job and tries hard but gets crapped on by everyone around him on a daily basis .
“ Every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it .
So that means that every single day that you see me , that ’s on the worst day of my life . ” – Peter Gibbons
“ Excuse me , I believe you have my stapler … ” – Milton Waddams
7. Shaun – Shaun of the Dead

Shaun is like all of us , with nothing ever interesting happening to him day by day .
That is until zombies take over the country and Shaun becomes his friends ’ last chance for survival with a rifle in one hand and a pack of peanuts in the other .
The ultimate English slouch becomes one of its best action heroes .
“ You ’re the one that ’s gone from being a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston ! ” – Shaun
6. Willie – Bad Santa
Foul mouthed , down on his luck and a drunk .
Willie is the perfect candidate for a in - store Santa Claus to entertain your children .
When he starts forming an unlikely bond with a young child you would assume life lessons follow .
Instead he carries on much the same – cursing , beating children up , punching a midget in the face – but we love him for it .
“ Why do n’t you wish in one hand , and shit in the other .
See which one fills up first . ” – Willie
5. Ash Williams – Evil Dead Trilogy
Another loser by day , zombie - killing machine by night ;
Ash just wanted to get away from it all with his girlfriend .
Little did he know the terrors that awaited him in the woods .
Everything tries to kill Ash and as he falls into trouble again and again he emerges the coolest geek this side of our dimension .
He also looks kick - ass with a chainsaw for a hand .
“ Groovy ” – Ash
4. Max Fischer – Rushmore
Max is a loser who thinks he ’s the ultimate winner .
Nothing stands in his way , he gets what he wants and thinks everyone loves him .
It turns out though that everyone thinks he ’s a spotty wee skidmark at Rushmore Elementary .
Charismatic he may be but with a pretentious elitist attitude and flunking every class he is one guy who punches above his weight .
“ Oh my God , I wrote a hit play ! ” – Max Fischer
3. Spinal Tap – This Is Spinal Tap
The world would be a less sexier place if it was n’t for these rock and roll stars .
These guys just ca n’t seem to get anything right , whether it be replacing their manager , just getting out of a prop onstage or keeping a drummer that does n’t die .
Their Stonehenge re-enactment is the most stupidly brilliant live performance of all time and this trio of David St. Hubbins , Nigel Tufnel and Derek Smalls are cemented in rock history for ever .
“ It ’s such a fine line between stupid , and clever . ” – David St. Hubbins
2. Jay and Silent Bob / Dante and Randall – Clerks , Clerks 2 , The View Askewniverse
These four are bundled together for their respective charms , they are a ying and yang foursome .
Jay and Bob stand outside the Quick Stop store , selling weed and dancing like loons everyday all their lives .
They ’re content with how they live and are n’t going anywhere fast .
Dante ca n’t stand being anywhere near the Quick Stop he ’s working at and only has Randall to pass the time with .
These guys have the ultimate ‘ do nothing and hope something will come my way ’ attitude .
For their failures all four are totally likeable and relatable in different ways .
Long live the Clerks !
“ I ’m not even supposed to be here today ! ” – Dante
“ That guy ’s being awfully forward with that donkey . ” – Jay
1. The Dude – The Big Lebowski
Here he is , numeral uno , The Dude .
Never before has someone who has exerted so little been forced into doing so much .
He was a man who does few things bowling , driving around , the occasional acid flashback .
When his life gets pissed on he gets tangled into a dark mystery he has to get to the bottom of , all for the sake of a rug !
Rarely losing his cool , he is one guy who can be on our bowling team any day .
“ That rug really tied the room together ! ” – The Dude
The Dude was the only one who could be at the top but what do you make of the list ?
Anyone you think deserves to be on there who is n’t ?
Strike back below and let us know .

Some day in the not - too - distant future , someone will pen a book called Who Wrecked America ?
If the book is honest , fingers will be pointed at the crooks and liars in Washington DC and Wall Street , at lobbyists ( pimps ) and Congressmen ( whores ) , at bankers and war toy makers , at AIPAC and PNAC , at presidents , executives and generals .
Doubtful that anyone will conclude that Iran had much to do with the destruction of America .
Although today Iran remains in the gunsights of the master criminals in DC , that distant land does less damage to America than a handful of high American officials .
Truthfully , I feel more threatened by Bush and Bolton , by Barack and Barak , by McCain and Cheney and Pelosi , than anyone in Iran .
Nukes or no nukes , Iran threatens me less than the Fed , Congress , the US media or the president .
When the history of the late , great nation known as America is written , our own homegrown jackals will be rightly blamed for the destruction .
Forgotten will be the nineteen G - string jihadists with their Korans and boxcutters .
If the history books are honest and the historians adroit , the blame will lie less with the Taliban and more with the Ivy League educated in their tailored suits and power ties .
Who knew the first US president with an MBA could wield so much destructive power ?
Maybe an MBA stands for Master of Bankrupting America .
Certainly someone should revoke the charter of the university that bestowed an MBA on George W. Bush .
More to blame than any US president , Congress sanctions , and has always permitted , the wholesale destruction of the nation .
Perhaps the rich remain loyal to the rich alone .
Indeed , a majority of Americans do not even know that Congress allowed the creation of the Federal Reserve .
Congress votes to allow US presidents wholesale destructive powers .
Congress writes the checks that allow worldwide US imperialism , funding dictators , toppling democracies , while bankrupting America .
Congress shuns its sworn duty , to protect and preserve the Constitution and the country , every step of the way .
Indeed , as I write this , Congress is weighing more war power measures , called House Resolution 362 , giving the president even more destructive powers .
Even while America collapses like WTC - 7 , Congress will find ways to add to the rubble pile .
As Doug Thompson wrote years ago : " Nobody 's life , liberty or property is safe while Congress is in session . "
The American media certainly threatens me far more than Iran .
Covert threat rather than overt .
By continuously spreading false propaganda for a series of profitable yet fraudulent wars , the US mainstream media does as much or more to wreck this country than any US president .
Pundits lament that fewer Americans read the newspaper anymore .
Critic Rick Shenkman calls us woodenheaded or boneheaded for our ignorance but fails to note a far more serious form of American ignorance called subtle brainwashing .
By selectively reporting and slanting the " news , " the corporate - owned US media is no different than a cabal of mullahs bent on controlling the behavior and opinion of the populace .
Georges Santana wrote : " Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . "
To that I would add , those who profit from the past and present are determined to control the future .
Consider :
This so - called gas shortage and the collective short - sightedness of our so - called leaders seems altogether too planned , too convenient .
Ask yourself this question :
In the wake of another attack , provocation or terror strike , would the American people be more or less controllable without a steady supply of gas ?
Would the American people be more or less willing and able to assemble ?
Would they have the means or money to drive to Washington DC to protest ?
Without a steady supply of gasoline , and thus without food , without work , would the American people be MORE OR LESS at the mercy of their leaders to provide it ?
Those who threaten my health or well - being , endangering those I love and destroying both law and land , pretend to act for my benefit .
THEY DO NOT .
I never voted for them , nor do I support them in any way in their duplicitous and diabolical agenda .
ROME -- Lance Armstrong agreed Monday to ride in next year 's Giro d'Italia and suggested the Italian race -- not the Tour de France -- will be the main target in his comeback season .
The American has never competed in the three - week Giro , considered the sport 's most prestigious stage race after the Tour .
" Everyone is saying that the Giro will serve to prepare for the Tour , " Armstrong said in a written statement released by organizers in Italian .
" Actually , it could be that I come to Italy to win and the Giro will actually be my real three - week stage race of the year . "
Winning both the Giro and the Tour in the same year after more than three years away from the sport would be an unprecedented challenge for someone of Armstrong 's age .
The 37 - year - old Armstrong announced last month that he is returning to cycling after three years in retirement and hoped to win the Tour for an eighth time .
The 100th anniversary edition of the Giro is scheduled for May 9 - 31 .
The Tour de France starts July 4 .
The last rider to win both the Giro and the Tour in the same year was Marco Pantani in 1998 .
Pantani died of a cocaine overdose in 2004 .
" I raced a long time professionally and never did the Giro , " Armstrong said in a video message released Monday by race organizers .
" It was one of my biggest regrets and now I 'm going to be able to erase that regret and be at the 2009 Giro .
And who knows , maybe with a good result . "
Armstrong also seemed to take a swipe at Tour de France organizers , with whom he has feuded over drug - testing issues .
" I look forward to starting a race that respects not only the riders but also maintains the highest integrity in sport , " he said .
Armstrong spokesman Mark Higgins said in an e-mail to The Associated Press that " it does n't look like " the rider will be in Paris as expected on Oct. 22 when Tour de France organizers unveil next year 's route .
Higgins said Armstrong has to be at an annual fundraising ride in Austin , Texas , where he lives , a few days later .
There have been subtle hints all along from Armstrong that he is fed up with the Tour .
When the new head of Tour organizer ASO , Jean - Etienne Amaury , said recently that Armstrong had embarrassed the French race over the years , Armstrong responded by saying , " Nobody ever said that I need the Tour de France " to raise cancer awareness .
Giro director Angelo Zomegnan indicated that Armstrong may have entered the Giro to protect himself in case more problems arise with the Tour .
French anti-doping authorities recently asked Armstrong to retest his 1999 urine samples to see whether the French sports daily L'Equipe was right when it reported they contained the banned substance EPO .
Armstrong rejected the notion and lashed out at the French agency 's leader , Pierre Bordry , saying the samples have been preserved improperly .
" He would like to race the Tour de France , because the Tour is the biggest stage in cycling and it would give him and his foundation the most visibility , " Zomegnan told The Associated Press .
" But there are complications on the French front . "
Zomegnan said the Giro strictly follows the anti-doping rules of cycling 's governing body , the UCI .
" We would never get in the way of the sport 's authorities , " he said .
Armstrong has joined the Astana team , which also features Alberto Contador , the defending Giro champion .
However , Contador is unlikely to enter the Giro and Armstrong will not have to risk the possibility of being relegated to a support rider for the Spaniard , as he might at the Tour .
" Until I see Armstrong at the start of the 2009 Giro I wo n't believe it .
It does n't seem like a very wise choice , " said Francesco Moser , the 1984 Giro winner and 1977 world champion .
" At 37 , after three years of inactivity it seems pretty risky .
Plus , racing the Tour in the same year is n't simple . "
By competing in the Giro , Armstrong will have raced in all three major multistage races .
He finished fourth in the 1998 Spanish Vuelta .
" Maybe his career was incomplete , " Zomegnan said .
" I think he 's coming to race and be a top contender .
And the differences between being a top contender and winning include small and large details .
We 'll see how it plays out in May . "
Armstrong 's comeback is meant to draw attention to his global campaign to fight cancer , a disease he survived before winning seven straight Tours from 1999 - 2005 .
Armstrong will begin his comeback at the Tour Down Under in Adelaide , Australia , in January , then will likely enter the Tour of California in February .
Armstrong is loading his schedule to get more racing days in before the Tour .
In his heyday , Armstrong usually only entered a handful of short races before the Tour .
He could revive his rivalry with Ivan Basso at the Giro .
Basso's two - year ban for doping expires later this month .
The Italian finished third and second behind Armstrong in the 2004 and 2005 Tours , respectively .
As my tiny desk disappears still further under a mountain of crap , I yearn to just stick everything but the computer in a cupboard , the collection of cables and flashing LEDs safely contained .
What I need is a NAS .
And if Iomega 's new terabyte box manages to keep its price down on its journey across the Atlantic , I might just have found one .
The StorCenter ix2 is a networked hard drive with gigabit ( 10/1000 ) ethernet , UPnP support ( which , for any security minded person will be useless ) , iTunes server support ( I think it just means you can keep your library on there , like any other external drive ) and some Windows - only backup software ( EMC Retrospect ) .
There are also a couple of USB ports , and the ix2 works as a print server .
Inside , the terabyte is split across two drives , and RAID 1 support means you can mirror your data for safety .
Available at the end of the month in two sizes , 1TB for $ 300 and 2TB for $ 480 .

So now they tell us .
Two months after the brief but bloody war in the Caucasus which was overwhelmingly blamed on Russia by western politicians and media at the time , a serious investigation by the BBC has uncovered a very different story .
Not only does the report by Tim Whewell – aired this week on Newsnight and on Radio 4's File on Four - find strong evidence confirming western - backed Georgia as the aggressor on the night of August 7 .
It also assembles powerful testimony of wide - ranging war crimes carried out by the Georgian army in its attack on the contested region of South Ossetia .
They include the targeting of apartment block basements – where civilians were taking refuge – with tank shells and Grad rockets , the indiscriminate bombardment of residential districts and the deliberate killing of civilians , including those fleeing the South Ossetian capital of Tskinvali .
The carefully balanced report – which also details evidence of ethnic cleansing by South Ossetian paramilitaries – cuts the ground from beneath later Georgian claims that its attack on South Ossetia followed the start of a Russian invasion the previous night .
At the time , the Georgian government said its assault on Tskinvali was intended to " restore constitutional order " in an area it has never ruled , as well as to counter South Ossetian paramilitary provocations .
Georgian intelligence subsequently claimed to have found the tape of an intercepted phone call backing up its Russian invasion story – but even Georgia 's allies balk at a claim transparently intended to bolster its shaky international legal position .
Naturally the man who ordered the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia , president Mikheil Saakashvili , denies the war crimes accusations .
But what of his Anglo - American sponsors , who insisted at the time that " Russian aggression must not go unanswered " ?
British foreign secretary David Miliband now accepts Georgia was " reckless " and says he treats the war crimes allegations " extremely seriously " .
US assistant secretary of state , Daniel Fried , meanwhile concedes Georgia 's attack on Tskhinvali was " wrong on several levels " , but feels that discussion of its war crimes is " not terribly useful " .
In the wake of the Georgian attack , Russian troops moved into Georgia proper , destroying Georgian military facilities used to mount the original assault – and inflicting their own civilian casualties in the process , notably in Gori .
Earlier this month they pulled back from their Georgian buffer zone into now nominally - independent South Ossetia .
At the start of the August conflict , western media reporting was relatively even - handed , but rapidly switched into full - blown cold war revival mode as Russia turned the tables on the US 's Georgian client regime and Nato expansion in the region .
Clear initial evidence of who started the war and Georgian troops ' killing spree in Tskhinvali was buried or even denied in a highly effective PR operation from Tbilisi .
Within a week , the former Foreign Office special adviser David Clark was for example accusing me on Comment is free of making an " important error of fact " by stating that " several hundreds civilians " had been killed by Georgian forces in Tskhinvali .
I based that on several reports , including in the Observer .
Clark insisted there was " no independent support for this claim " .
But , as reported by the BBC this week , Human Rights Watch now regards the figure of 300- 400 civilian dead in Tskhinvali as a " useful starting point " .
Meanwhile , with the exception of a small item in the Independent , Whewell 's significant new evidence about what actually took place in a conflict likely to have far - reaching strategic consequences has been simply ignored by the rest of the mainstream media .
Years ago , I predicted that colleges would write commitment to “ social justice , ” “ diversity , ” etc. , into mission statements and then make it part of their job descriptions .
I never imagined they would get so brazenly specific in their interrogation of candidates .
And then to put it on their web site for all to see !

Money market funds are generally designed to be the functional equivalent of a bank account : short - term vehicles where you park cash you are n't using at the moment .
Investors are supposed to be able to pull their money out at any time .
That meant that all the funds , sound or not , were vulnerable to a run .
And virtually any fund that experienced a run would " break the buck " because while these funds are perfectly safe and liquid in normal circumstances , no one could dump a billion dollars worth of securities on the market without seeing the price of those securities plummet .
Since funds definitionally try to hold their asset base near a dollar a share , and distribute the yield , there was no gigantic cushion to pad the sales .
The runs meant that all the money market funds were in the same boat : everyone wanted to sell and hoard cash in case of a run .
No one wanted to buy .
Once busted funds had gotten rid of their very short paper , they were stuck with the weeks / months maturities , which were virtually unsaleable .
Unless the parent institutions make your investors whole the only thing you can do in that situation is distribute the assets in kind , to investors who can't sell them any more than you could .
Ultimately , despite last week 's bailouts , no one wanted to hold financial company paper .
Unfortunately , as I understand it that paper made up the bulk of the money markets , which is hardly surprising given the volume of trades they do ( did ) every day .
Banks have tens of billions of debt maturities to refinance in the coming months .
The overwhelming majority of it will be good even under distressed circumstances -- unless they can't roll any of it over .
At that point , they experience the same problems you would if your credit card company pulled your credit line and demanded you pay back everything you owe them .
No doubt some of my readers are rubbing their hands and saying " Exactly what should happen to people who carry credit card balances ! "
And I 'm sure that among you there are people who pay cash on the barrel for everything , having never taken out any loan for a house , an automobile , an education , a personal financial crisis .
These people never even use an American Express Card , which is , of course , a short - term loan .
They also do not work for companies that borrow money to buy capital equipment or finance expansion , and their firms do not experience any mismatch between their payables and their receivables .
Those people should stop reading now , because I 'm pretty sure the Amish are n't supposed to use the internet .
The rest of us live in a world that is created and run by institutions that amass capital from millions of people and concentrate it in areas where it ( usually ) makes people better off .
I 'm particularly confused by conservatives who claim to hate fractional reserve banking , duration mismatches in the financial system , and easy credit / bankruptcy .
If you think more deeply about it , there are three reasons why this opposition is silly :
Did you know that 50 to 70 percent of muscle gain ( in terms of size ) from body building style weightlifting is not actually muscle fiber at all ?
It ’s actually a fluid called Sarcoplasm .
As Sarcoplasm is a fluid and not muscle fiber it contributes very little to strength .
Many red - blooded men and women would like nothing more than to become stronger .
The sense of achieving something of our human physical potential can be very fulfilling .
Unfortunately modern bodybuilding has become a last refuge for lost souls with poor self - esteem and body image issues .
This must at least be partly responsible for taking bodybuilding far from its original roots .
Bodybuilding has hugely influenced what people do at home and at the gym when they lift weights .
Unfortunately bodybuilding has largely lost its way .
It is now primarily just another arm of a profit driven “ fitness ” industry along with other sectors such as supplements and weight loss .
So today when we examine the following six rules of strength you may find that almost all the rules presented here are in direct contravention of commonly held body building “ wisdom ” .
That ’s because these rules are for iron athletes who want to become strong and be as strong as they look .
Never go to failure
This is as good a place to start as any .
A long held tenant of bodybuilding is that you should go to failure ( lift until you cannot lift anymore ) .
Take a turn around your local gym and you ’ll see all types of people working out half reps and assisted reps that help push them into complete muscle failure .
Compare this behavior to the massive size and strength of phenomenal powerlifters and Olympic weightlifters and know that they never go to failure .
Nor does the greatest fighter on the planet Fedor Emelianenko .
This is because training to failure is training to fail .
By not going to failure when he lifts , Fedor gets stronger while still remaining fresh enough to train fighting techniques .
That means you can get a lot stronger without burning yourself out .
No more feeling too exhausted post workout .
No more feeling sore for three days after a workout .
No more than five reps per set
Completing no more than five reps per set caries on from the idea of never going to failure .
Figure out what your one rep max for a particular lift is and set the bar at around 70 to 80 percent it .
Use that weight to do low rep sets of one to five reps .
There is nothing wrong with doing heavy singles .
Also , while perhaps counterintuitive , lifting heavy for sets of 1 to 5 reps is the safest way to lift .
This is because the stabilizing muscles get tired before the prime movers in high rep sets , which sets you up for an injury .
Lift heavy
If you want to get strong you have to lift heavy .
This is dead simple .
Sure , using light weights for high rep sets may give you some tone but doing so will never make you strong .
Lifting heavy requires a large amount of tension .
You will be forced to recruit muscle fibers in places not normally directly activated by the lift .
Tension is strength .
The greater the weight the greater the amount of tension required .
Think of strength as a skill .
The more muscle fibers you can recruit to a movement and the harder the contraction of those muscle fibers the stronger you are .
Lifting with heavy weights should be approached as practice as opposed to working out .
Lift often
Many powerlifting and Olympic lifting teams work out as many as eight times per week or even more .
This means they are working out more than once a day .
They can do this because they are not going to failure and are working low rep sets .
It has been found that completing five heavy singles per day for five days in a row is better for strength development than completing five sets of five reps on a single day .
Take longer rest periods between sets
To avoid failure , you will need to take longer rests between sets .
This will allow your body to adequately recover for the next heavy lift .
You also will not experience anywhere near as much soreness post workout as a result of extending your rest periods .
Focus on compound movements
Powerlifters and Olympic lifters do not train body parts .
As discussed above with regards to tension , your body combined is far stronger than your body broken down by isolation exercises .
Stick to lifts such as the deadlift , squat , benchpress , military press and the Olympic lifts – snatch and clean and jerk .

Michael I. Pos­ner is a promi­nent sci­en­tist in the field of cog­ni­tive neu­ro­science .
He is cur­rent­ly an emer­i­tus pro­fes­sor of neu­ro­science at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Ore­gon ( Depart­ment of Psy­chol­o­gy , Insti­tute of Cog­ni­tive and Deci­sion Sci­ences ) .
In August 2008 , the Inter­na­tion­al Union of Psy­cho­log­i­cal Sci­ence made him the first recip­i­ent of the Dogan Prize “ in recog­ni­tion of a con­tri­bu­tion that rep­re­sents a major advance in psy­chol­o­gy by a schol­ar or team of schol­ars of high inter­na­tion­al rep­u­ta­tion . ”
Dr. Pos­ner , many thanks for your time today .
I real­ly enjoyed the James Arthur Lec­ture mono­graph on Evo­lu­tion and Devel­op­ment of Self - Reg­u­la­tion that you deliv­ered last year .
Could you pro­vide a sum­ma­ry of the research you pre­sent­ed ?
I would empha­size that we human beings can reg­u­late our thoughts , emo­tions , and actions to a greater degree than oth­er pri­mates .
For exam­ple , we can choose to pass up an imme­di­ate reward for a larg­er , delayed reward .
We can plan ahead , resist dis­trac­tions , be goal - ori­ent­ed .
These human char­ac­ter­is­tics appear to depend upon what we often call “ self - reg­u­la­tion . ”
What is excit­ing these days is that progress in neu­roimag­ing and in genet­ics make it pos­si­ble to think about self - reg­u­la­tion in terms of spe­cif­ic brain - based net­works .
Can you explain what self - reg­u­la­tion is ?
All par­ents have seen this in their kids .
Par­ents can see the remark­able trans­for­ma­tion as their chil­dren devel­op the abil­i­ty to reg­u­late emo­tions and to per­sist with goals in the face of dis­trac­tions .
That abil­i­ty is usu­al­ly labeled ‚ self - reg­u­la­tion .
The oth­er main area of your research is atten­tion .
Can you explain the brain - basis for what we usu­al­ly call “ atten­tion ” ?
I have been inter­est­ed in how the atten­tion sys­tem devel­ops in infan­cy and ear­ly child­hood .
One of our major find­ings , thanks to neu­roimag­ing , is that there is not one sin­gle “ atten­tion ” , but three sep­a­rate func­tions of atten­tion with three sep­a­rate under­ly­ing brain net­works : alert­ing , ori­ent­ing , and exec­u­tive atten­tion .
1 ) Alert­ing : helps us main­tain an Alert State .
2 ) Ori­ent­ing : focus­es our sens­es on the infor­ma­tion we want .
For exam­ple , you are now lis­ten­ing to my voice .
3 ) Exec­u­tive Atten­tion : reg­u­lates a vari­ety of net­works , such as emo­tion­al respons­es and sen­so­ry infor­ma­tion .
This is crit­i­cal for most oth­er skills , and clear­ly cor­re­lat­ed with aca­d­e­m­ic per­for­mance .
It is dis­trib­uted in frontal lobes and the cin­gu­late gyrus .
The devel­op­ment of exec­u­tive atten­tion can be eas­i­ly observed both by ques­tion­naire and cog­ni­tive tasks after about age 3 ‑4 , when par­ents can iden­ti­fy the abil­i­ty of their chil­dren to reg­u­late their emo­tions and con­trol their behav­ior in accord with social demands .
“ Exec­u­tive atten­tion ” sounds sim­i­lar to exec­u­tive func­tions .
Exec­u­tive func­tions are goal - ori­ent­ed .
Exec­u­tive atten­tion is just the abil­i­ty to man­age atten­tion towards those goals , towards plan­ning .
Both are clear­ly cor­re­lat­ed .
Exec­u­tive atten­tion is impor­tant for deci­sion - mak­ing ( how to accom­plish an exter­nal goal ) and with work­ing mem­o­ry ( the tem­po­rary stor­age of infor­ma­tion ) .
For exam­ple , giv­en that you said ear­li­er that you liked my mono­graph , I have been think­ing of the sub­head­ings and sec­tions there as I pro­vide you my answers , using my work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty .
You said that each of the three func­tions of atten­tion are sup­port­ed by sep­a­rate neur­al net­works .
Neu­roimag­ing allows us to iden­ti­fy sets of dis­trib­uted areas that oper­ate togeth­er .
Dif­fer­ent tech­niques allow us to see dif­fer­ent things .
For exam­ple , fMRI lets us see the acti­va­tion of areas of grey mat­ter .
A more recent tech­nique , dif­fu­sion ten­sor , is focused instead on the white mat­ter .
It detects con­nec­tiv­i­ty among neu­rons , it helps us see a map of net­works .
How many net­works have been iden­ti­fied so far ?
So far , a num­ber of net­works have been iden­ti­fied .
For an illus­tra­tion , you can see the won­der­ful inter­ac­tive Brain Map by the Uni­ver­si­ty of Texas , San Anto­nio ( Note : http://www.brainmap.org/).
Let me men­tion anoth­er fas­ci­nat­ing area of research .
There is a type of neu­ron , named the Von Economo neu­ron , which is found only in the ante­ri­or cin­gu­late and a relat­ed area of the ante­ri­or insu­la , very com­mon in humans , less in oth­er pri­mates , and com­plete­ly absent in most non-pri­mates .
These neu­rons have long axons , con­nect­ing to the ante­ri­or cin­gu­late and ante­ri­or insu­la , which we think is part of the rea­son why we have Exec­u­tive Atten­tion .
Dif­fu­sion ten­sor allows us to iden­ti­fy this white mat­ter , these con­nec­tions across sep­a­rate brain struc­tures , in the live brain .
From a prac­ti­cal point of view , we can think that neur­al net­works like this are what enable spe­cif­ic human traits such as effort­ful con­trol .
What is effort­ful con­trol ?
It is a high­er - order tem­pera­ment fac­tor con­sist­ing of atten­tion , focus shift­ing , and inhibito­ry con­trol — both for chil­dren and adults .
A com­mon exam­ple is how often you may make plans that you do not fol­low through with .
A test often used to mea­sure exec­u­tive atten­tion is the Stroop Test ( you can try it here ) .
Effort­ful con­trol has been shown to cor­re­late with the scores on exec­u­tive atten­tion at sev­er­al ages dur­ing child­hood , and imag­ing stud­ies have linked it to brain areas involved in self - reg­u­la­tion .
Good par­ent­ing has been shown to build good effort­ful con­trol , so there are clear impli­ca­tions from this research .
Tell us now about your recent research on atten­tion train­ing
Sev­er­al train­ing pro­grams have been suc­cess­ful in improv­ing atten­tion in nor­mal adults and in patients suf­fer­ing from dif­fer­ent patholo­gies .
With nor­mal adults , train­ing with video games pro­duced bet­ter per­for­mance on a range of visu­al atten­tion tasks .
Train­ing has also led to spe­cif­ic improve­ments in exec­u­tive atten­tion in patients with spe­cif­ic brain injury .
Work­ing - mem­o­ry train­ing can improve atten­tion with ADHD chil­dren .
In one recent study we devel­oped and test­ed a 5 ‑ day train­ing inter­ven­tion using com­put­er­ized exer­cis­es .
We test­ed the effect of train­ing dur­ing the peri­od of major devel­op­ment of exec­u­tive atten­tion , which takes place between 4 and 7 years of age .
We found that exec­u­tive atten­tion was train­able , and also a sig­nif­i­cant­ly greater improve­ment in intel­li­gence in the trained group com­pared to the con­trol chil­dren .
This find­ing sug­gest­ed that train­ing effects had gen­er­al­ized to a mea­sure of cog­ni­tive pro­cess­ing that is far removed from the train­ing exer­cis­es .
A col­lab­o­ra­tor of our lab , Dr. Yiyuan Tang , stud­ied the impact of mind­ful­ness med­i­ta­tion with under­grads to improve exec atten­tion , find­ing sig­nif­i­cant improve­ments as well .
We hope that train­ing method like this will be fur­ther eval­u­at­ed , along with oth­er meth­ods , both as pos­si­ble means of improv­ing atten­tion pri­or to school and for chil­dren and adults with spe­cif­ic needs .
Can you explain the poten­tial impli­ca­tions of this emerg­ing research on Edu­ca­tion and Health ?
It is clear that exec­u­tive atten­tion and effort­ful con­trol are crit­i­cal for suc­cess in school .
Will they one day be trained in pre-schools ?
It sounds rea­son­able to believe so , to make sure all kids are ready to learn .
Of course , addi­tion­al stud­ies are need­ed to deter­mine exact­ly how and when atten­tion train­ing can best be accom­plished and its last­ing impor­tance .
In terms of health , many deficits and clin­i­cal prob­lems have a com­po­nent of seri­ous deficits in exec­u­tive atten­tion net­work .
For exam­ple , when we talk about atten­tion deficits , we can expect that in the future there will be reme­di­a­tion meth­ods , such as work­ing mem­o­ry train­ing , to help alle­vi­ate those deficits .
Let me add that we have found no ceil­ing for abil­i­ties such as atten­tion , includ­ing among adults .
The more train­ing , even with nor­mal peo­ple , the high­er the results .
Let me ask your take on that eter­nal ques­tion , the roles of nature and nur­ture .
There is a grow­ing num­ber of stud­ies that show the impor­tance of inter­ac­tion between our genes and each of our envi­ron­ments .
Epi­ge­net­ics is going to help us under­stand that ques­tion bet­ter , but let me share a very inter­est­ing piece of research from my lab where we found an unusu­al inter­ac­tion between genet­ics and par­ent­ing .
Good par­ent­ing , as mea­sured by dif­fer­ent research - based scales , has been shown to build good effort­ful con­trol which , as we saw ear­li­er , is so impor­tant .
Now , what we found is that some spe­cif­ic genes reduced , even elim­i­nat­ed , the influ­ence of the qual­i­ty of par­ent­ing .
In oth­er words , some chil­dren ’s devel­op­ment real­ly depends on how their par­ents bring them up , where­as oth­ers do not — or do to a much small­er extent .
Too bad that we do not have time now to explore all the poten­tial eth­i­cal impli­ca­tions from emerg­ing research like that …let me ask a few final ques­tions .
First , giv­en that we have been talk­ing both about for­mal train­ing pro­grams ( com­put­er - based , med­i­ta­tion ) and also infor­mal ones ( par­ent­ing ) , do we know how for­mal and infor­mal learn­ing inter­act ?
what type can be most effec­tive when , and for whom ?
Great ques­tion .
We do n’t know at this point .
A research insti­tute in Seat­tle , fund­ed by the Nation­al Sci­ence Foun­da­tion , is try­ing to address that ques­tion .
One prac­ti­cal issue they address is the influ­ence of bilin­gual edu­ca­tion on cog­ni­tion .
How can Sharp­Brains read­ers access the com­put­er - based atten­tion train­ing pro­gram you talked about ear­li­er ?
Researchers and par­ents can down­load the pro­gram , which is aimed at kids aged 4 to 6 .
The com­put­er­ized exer­cis­es are avail­able on www.teach-the-brain.org.
Click on learn­ing tools and fol­low atten­tion .
Final­ly , what can we expect from your lab in the next years ?
We will hear soon if we obtain the NIH pro­pos­al to train chil­dren at age 5 and then fol­low - up over the years , com­pared to a con­trol group .
The pro­gram I men­tioned ear­li­er showed good short - term results , but we would like to track those kids over time and see what hap­pens .
For exam­ple , we will exam­ine whether or not an ear­ly inter­ven­tion might trans­late into a “ snow­ball effect ” of high­er lev­els of cog­ni­tive and school per­for­mance .

The bzr testsuite now passes on OS X and Python 2.6 , and almost completely passes on Windows .
The smartserver code has gained several bug fixes and performance improvements , and can now run server - side hooks within an http server .
Thanks to everyone who contributed patches , suggestions , questions and bug reports .
We welcome your feedback on this release to bazaar at lists.canonical.com or to #bzr on freenode .
bzr 1.8 is now available for download from http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download as a source tarball ; packages for various systems will be available soon .
-- Martin bzr 1.8 2008-10-16 ------------------
Bazaar 1.8 includes several fixes that improve working tree performance , display of revision logs , and merges .
The bzr testsuite now passes on OS X and Python 2.6 , and almost completely passes on Windows .
The smartserver code has gained several bug fixes and performance improvements , and can now run server - side hooks within an http server .
BUG FIXES : * Fix " Must end write group " error when another error occurs during ``bzr push`` .
( Andrew Bennetts , # 230902 ) PORTABILITY : * Some Pyrex versions require the WIN32 macro defined to compile on that platform .
( Alexander Belchenko , Martin Pool , # 277481 ) bzr 1.8rc1 2008-10-07 ---------------------
CHANGES : * ``bzr log file`` has been changed .
It now uses a different method for determining which revisions to show as merging the changes to the file .
It now only shows revisions which merged the change towards your mainline .
This simplifies the output , makes it faster , and reduces memory consumption .
( John Arbash Meinel ) * ``bzr merge`` now defaults to having `` -- reprocess`` set , whenever `` -- show - base`` is not supplied .
( John Arbash Meinel ) * ``bzr+http// `` will now optionally load plugins and write logs on the server .
( Marius Kruger ) * ``bzrlib._dirstate_helpers_c.pyx`` does not compile correctly with Pyrex 0.9.4.1 ( it generates C code which causes segfaults ) .
We explicitly blacklist that version of the compiler for that extension .
Packaged versions will include .c files created with pyrex >= 0.9.6 so it does n't effect releases , only users running from the source tree .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 276868 ) FEATURES * bzr is now compatible with python - 2.6 .
python - 2.6 is not yet officially supported ( nor released , tests were conducted with the dev version of python - 2.6r c2 ) , but all known problems have been fixed .
Feedback welcome .
( Vincent Ladeuil , # 269535 ) IMPROVEMENTS : * ``bzr annotate`` will now include uncommitted changes from the local working tree by default .
Such uncommitted changes are given the revision number they would get if a commit was done , followed with a ? to indicate that its not actually known .
( Robert Collins , # 3439 ) * ``bzr branch`` now accepts a ``-- standalone`` option , which creates a standalone branch regardless of the presence of shared repositories .
( Daniel Watkins ) * ``bzr push`` is faster in the case there are no new revisions to push .
It is also faster if there are no tags in the local branch .
( Andrew Bennetts ) *
File changes during a commit will update the tree stat cache .
( Robert Collins ) * Location aliases can now accept a trailing path .
( Micheal Hudson ) * New hooks ``Lock.hooks`` when LockDirs are acquired and released .
( Robert Collins , MartinPool ) * Switching in heavyweight checkouts uses the master branch 's context , not the checkout 's context .
( Adrian Wilkins ) * ``status`` on large trees is now faster , due to optimisations in the walkdirs code .
Of particular note , the walkdirs code now performs a temporary ``chdir ( ) `` while reading a single directory ; if your platform has non thread - local current working directories ( and is not windows which has its own implementation ) , this may introduce a race condition during concurrent uses of bzrlib .
The bzrlib CLI will not encounter this as it is single threaded for working tree operations .
( Robert Collins ) *
The C extensions now build on python 2.4 ( Robert Collins , # 271939 ) *
The `` -Dhpss`` debug flag now reports the number of smart server calls per medium to stderr .
This is in addition to the existing detailed logging to the . bzr.log trace file .
( Andrew Bennetts ) BUG FIXES : * Avoid random failures arising from misinterpreted ``errno`` values in ``_readdir_pyx.read_dir`` .
( Martin Pool , # 279381 ) * Branching from a shared repository on a smart server into a new repository now preserves the repository format .
( Andrew Bennetts , # 269214 ) * ``bzr log`` now accepts a ``--change`` option .
( Vincent Ladeuil , # 248427 ) * ``bzr missing`` now accepts an ``-- include - merges`` option .
( Vincent Ladeuil , # 233817 ) *
Do n't try to filter ( internally ) '. bzr ' from the files to be deleted if it 's not there .
( Vincent Ladeuil , # 272648 ) * Fix ' _in_buffer '
AttributeError when using the - Dhpss debug flag .
( Andrew Bennetts ) * Fix TooManyConcurrentRequests errors caused by a connection failure when doing ``bzr pull`` or ``bzr merge`` from a ``bzr + ssh`` URL .
( Andrew Bennetts , # 246233 ) *
Fixed ``bzr st -r branch : PATH_TO_BRANCH`` where the other branch is in a different repository than the current one .
( Luká š Lalinský , # 144421 ) *
Make the first line of the manpage preamble a comment again .
( David Futcher , # 242106 ) * Remove use of optional parameter in GSSAPI FTP support , since it breaks newer versions of Python - Kerberos .
( Jelmer Vernooij ) *
The autopacking logic will now always create a single new pack from all of the content which it deems is worth moving .
This avoids the ' repack a single pack ' bug and should result in better packing overall .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 242510 , # 172644 ) * Trivial documentation fix .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 270471 ) DOCUMENTATION : * Explain revision / range identifiers .
( Daniel Clemente ) API CHANGES : * ``CommitBuilder.record_entry_contents`` returns one more element in its result tuple - an optional file system hash for the hash cache to use .
( Robert Collins ) * ``dirstate .DirState.update_entry`` will now only calculate the sha1 of a file if it is likely to be needed in determining the output of iter_changes .
( Robert Collins ) * The PackRepository , Repository PackCollection , NewPack classes have a slightly changed interface to support different index types ; as a result other users of these classes need to supply the index types they want .
( Robert Collins ) TESTING : * ``bzrlib.tests.repository_implementations`` has been renamed to ``bzrlib.tests.per_repository`` so that we have a common structure ( and it is shorter ) .
( John Arbash Meinel , # 239343 ) * ``LocalTransport.abspath ( ) `` now returns a drive letter if the transport has one , fixing numerous tests on Windows .
( Mark Hammond ) * PreviewTree is now tested via intertree_implementations .

I like the ideas that Erlang promotes , but I find myself in a big problem trying to actually read Erlang .
That is , I can read sample code , more or less , but real code ?
Not so much .
I wo n't even touch on writing the code .
One of the problems is the lack of IDE support .
I tried both ErlIDE and Erlybird , none of them gave me so much as syntax highlighting .
They should , according to this post , but I could n't get it to work .
I ended up with Emacs , which is a tool that I just do n't understand .
It supports syntax highlighting , which is what I want to be able to read the code more easily , so that is fine .
Emacs is annoying , since I do n't understand it , but I can live with that .
The source code that I want to read is CouceDB , which is a Document DB with REST interface that got some attention lately .
I find the idea fascinating , and some of the concepts that they raise in the technical overview are quite interesting .
Anyway , I chose that to be the source code that will help me understand Erlang better .
Along the way , I expect to learn some about how CouchDB is implemented .
Unlike my usual code reviews , I do n't have the expertise or the background to actually judge anything with Erlang , so please take that into account .
One of the things that you notice very early with CouchDB is how little code there is in it .
I would expect a project for a database to be in the hundreds of thousands of lines and hundreds of files .
But apparently there is something else going on .
There are about 25 files , the biggest of them being 1,200 lines or so .
I know that the architecture is drastically different ( CouchDB shells out to other processes to do some of the things that it does ) , but I do n't think it is just that .
As usual , I am going to start reading code in file name order , and jump around in order to understand what is going on .
couch_btree is strange , I would expect Erlang to have an implementation of btree already .
Although , considering functional languages bias toward lists , it may not be the case .
A more probable option is that CouchDB could n't use the default implementation because of the different constraint it is working under .
This took me a while to figure out :
The equivalent in C# is :
public class btree { fd , root ; extract_kv = ( KeyValuePair kvp ) => kvp ; assemble_kv = ( KeyValuePair kvp ) => kvp ; less = ( a , b ) => a < b ; reduce = null } public object Extract ( btree , val ) { return btree.extract_kv(val ) ; }
The ability to magically extract values out of a record make the code extremely readable , once you know what is going on .
I am not sure why the Extract variable is on the right side , but I can live with it .
Here is another piece that I consider extremely elegant :
You call set_options with a list of tuples .
The first value in each tuple is the option you are setting , the second is the actual value to set .
This is very similar to Ruby 's hash parameters .
Note how it uses recursion to systematically handle each of those items , then it call itself with the rest of it .
Elegant .
It is also interesting to see how it deals with immutable structure , in that it keeps constructing new ones as copy of the old .
The only strange thing here is why we map split to extract and join to assemble .
I think it would be best to name them the same .
There is also the implementation of reduce :
This gave me a headache for a while , before I figured it out .
Let us say that we are calling final_reduce with a binary tree and a value .
We expect that value to always be a tuple of two lists .
We call the btree .reduce function on the value .
And this is the sequence of operations that is going on :
if the value is two empty lists , we call reduce with an empty list , and return its value .
if the value is composed of an empty list and a list with a single value , then we have reduced the value to its final state , and we can return that value .
if the value is an empty list and a list of reduced values , we call reduce again to re-reduce the list , and return its value .
if the value is two lists , we call reduce on the first and prepend the result to the second list .
Then we call final_reduce again with an empty list and the new second list .
Elegant , if you can follow what is going on .
There is a set of lookup functions that I am not sure that I can understand .
That seems to be a problem in general with the CouchDB source code , there is very little documentation , and I do n't think that it is just my newbie status at Erlang that is making this difficult .
I got up to get_node ( line 305 ) before I realized that this is n't actually an in memory structure .
This is backed by couch_file : pread_term , whatever that is .
And then we have write_node .
I am skipping ahead and see things like reduce_stream_kv_node2 , which I am pretty sure are discouraged in any language .
Anyway , general observation tells me that we have kvnode and kpnode .
I think that kvnode is key / value node and kpnode is key / pointer node .
I am lost beyond that .
Trying to read a function with eleven arguments tax my ability to actual understand what each of them is doing .
I found it very interesting to find test functions at the end of the file .
They seem to be testing the btree functionality .
Okay , I am giving up on understanding exactly how the btree works ( not uncommon when starting to read code , mind you ) , so I 'll just move on and record anything new that I have to say about the btree if I find something .
Next target , couch_config .
This one actually have documentation !
Be still , my heart :
Not sure what an ets table is , mind you .
couch_config is not just an API , like the couch_btree is .
It is a process using Erlang 's OTP in order to create an isolate process :
gen_server is a generic server component .
Think about this like a separate process that is running inside the Erlang VM .
Hm , looks like ets is an API to handle in memory databases .
Apparently they are implemented using Judy Arrays , a data structure implementation that aims to save in cache misses on the CPU .
This is the public API for cache_config :
It is a fairly typical OTP process , as far as I understand .
All calls to the process are translated to messages and sent to the server process to handle .
I do wonder about the ets:lookup and ets : match calls that the get is making .
I assume that those have to be sync calls .
Reading the ini file itself is an interesting piece of code :
In the first case , I am no sure why we need io : format ( " ~ s~n " , [ Msg ] ) , that seems like a no op to me .
The file parsing itself ( the lists : foldl ) is a true functional code .
It took me a long time to actually figure out what is going on with there , but I am impressed with the ability to express so much with so little code .
The last line uses a list comprehension to write all the values to the ets table .
On the other hand , it is fairly complex , for something that procedural code would handle with extreme ease and be more readable .
Let us take a look at the rest of the API , okay ?
This is the part that actually handles the calls that can be made to it ( the public API that we examined earlier ) .
Init is pretty easy to figure out .
We create a new in memory table , load all the the ini files ( using list comprehension to do so ) .
The last line is interesting .
Because servers needs to maintain state , they do it by always returning their state to their caller .
It is the responsibility of the Erlang platform ( actually , I think it is OTP specifically ) to maintain this state between calls .
The closest thing that I can think of is that this is similar to the user 's session , which can live beyond the span of a single request .
However , I am not sure how Erlang deals with concurrent requests to the same process , since then two calls might result in different state .
Maybe they solve this by serializing access to processes , and creating more processes to handle concurrency ( that sounds likely , but I am not sure ) .
The second function , handle_call of set will call insert_and_commit , which we will examine shortly , and just return the current state .
The function handle_call of delete is pretty obvious , I think , as is handle_call of all .
handle_call of register is interesting .
We use this to register a callback function .
The first thing we do is setup a monitor on the process that asked us for the callback .
When that process goes down , we will be called ( I 'll not show that , it is pretty trivial code ) .
Then we prepend the new callback and the process id to the notify_funs variable ( the callbacks functions ) and return it as the new state .
But what are we doing with those ?
Well , we call them in the insert_and_commit method .
The first thing we do is insert to the table , then we use list comprehension over all the callbacks ( notify_funs ) and call them .
Note that we use a catch block there to ignore errors from other processors .
We write the newly added config item to file as well , on the last line .
And this is it for couch_config .
couch_config_writer is n't really worth talking about .
Moving on to the first item of real meat .
The couch_db.erl file itself !
Unsurprisingly , couch_db , too , is an OTP managed process .
And the first two functions in the file tell us quite a bit .
catch , like all things in Erlang , is an expression .
So start_link will return the error , instead of throwing it .
I am not quite sure why this is used , it seems strange , like seeing a method whose return type is System .
Exception .
start_link0 , however , is interesting .
couch_file : open returns an Fd , I would assume that this is a File Descriptor , but the call to unlink below means that it is actually a process identifier , which means that couch_file : open creates a new process .
Probably we have a process per file .
I find this interesting .
We have seen couch_file used in the btree , but I have n't noticed it being its own process before .
Note the error recovery for file not found .
We then actually start the server , after we ensure that the file exists and valid , delete the old file if exists , and return .
We then have a few functions that just forward to the rest of couch_db :
Looks like those are used as a facade .
delete_doc is funny :
I am surprised that I can actually read this .
What this does is create a new document document for all the relevant versions that were passed .
I initially read it as modifying the doc and using pattern matching to do so , but it appears that this is actually creating a new one .
I hope that I 'll be able to understand update_docs .
In the meantime , this is fairly readable , I think :
This translate to the following C# code :
public var open_doc ( var db , var id , var options ) { var doc = open_doc_internal ( db , id , options ) ; if ( doc.deleted ) { if ( options .
Contains ( " deleted " ) ) return doc ; return null ; } return doc ; }
About the same line count .
And I am not sure what is more readable .
I am skipping a few functions that are not interesting , but I was proud that I was able to figure this one out :
We start with a sorted list of documents , which we pass to group_alike_docs /
2 :
if the first arg is an empty list , return the reserved list from the second arg .
If the first argument is a list with value , and the second one is an empty list , create a new bucket for that document , and recurse .
If both lists are not empty , requires its own explanation .
Note this piece of code :
[ #doc{id=BucketId}|_ ] = Bucket ,
This is the equivalent of the following C# code :
var Bucket Id = Bucket .
First ( ) .
Id ;
Now , given that , we can test if the bucket it equals to the current document it .
If it is , we add it to the existing bucket , if it is not , we create new one .
The syntax is pretty confusing , I admit , but it make sense when you realize that we are dealing with a sorted list .
By this time I am pretty sure that you are tired of me spelling out all the CouchDB code .
So I 'll only point out things that are of real interest .
couch_server is really elegant , and I was able to figure out all the code very easily .
One thing that is apparent to me is that I do n't understand the choice of using sync vs. async calls in Erlang .
couch_server is all synchronous calls , for example .
That is all for now , I reviewed couch_file as well , and I think that I need to go back to couch_btree to understand it more .
couch_ft_query is very interesting .
It is basically a way to shell out to an external process to do additional work .
This fits very well with the way that Erlang itself works .
What seems to be going on is that full text search is being shelled elsewhere , and the result of calling that javascript file is a set of doc id and score , which presumably can be used later to get an ordered list from the database itself .
This seems to indicate that there is a separate process that handles the actual indexing of the data ( Lucene / Solar seems to be a natural choice here ) .
It is n't currently used , which maps to what I know about the current state of CouchDB .
It is interesting to note that Lucene is also a document based store .
Moving on , couch_httpd is where the dispatching of all commands occur .
I took only a single part , which represent most of how the code looks like in this module :
I really like the way pattern matching is used here .
Although I must admit that it is strange to see function declaration being used as logic .
couch_view is the one that is responsible for views , obviously .
I can't follow all it is doing now , but it is shelling out some functionality to couch_query_servers , which is shelling the work , in turn , to ... a java script file .
This one , to be precise .
CouchDB is using an external process in order to handle all of its views processing .
This give it immense flexibility , since a user can define a view that does everything they want .
Communication is done using standard IO , which surprised me , but seems like the only way you could do cross platform process communication .
Especially if you wanted to communicated with java script .
All in all , that has been a very interesting codebase , that is all for now ...
For the single reader who actually wade through all of that , thanks .
Keeping large networks up to date can be a costly practice .
Large corporations or government institutions often need dozens , if not hundreds of servers to distribute updates and patches , for which they pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a year .
With DistriBrute , the first P2P based desktop deployment product , this is no longer needed - thanks to the BitTorrent protocol .
DistriBrute is a brand new desktop deployment solution developed by 4M88 .
Instead of several decentralized distribution servers , it uses the BitTorrent protocol to update workstations in a local network .
With DistriBrute , distribution servers are no longer needed .
The data does n’t have to be distributed from one location , since all the workstations connected to the network actively help in the spreading the data .
Every desktop in the system becomes a peer , and helps to send the data to other desktops .
The result : faster distribution of updates and patches , and a significant cost reduction .
There are more selling points other than the cost reductions and speed improvement .
Since servers tend to use a lot of energy , between 6000 and 7000 KWh a year , it can also be seen as a ‘ green ’ solution .
This ‘ green ’ aspect has not gone unnoticed .
Today , DistriBrute won the audience price of the Digikring Innovation Awards , an initiative that rewards environment friendly ICT solutions .
After winning the award , DistriBrute officially launched .
Thus far , it had two successful test runs at large educational institutions in The Netherlands , and the initial results are promising .
At INHOLLAND , a concept version of DistriBrute is now used to send software to 6500 desktop computers across 16 different locations .
It thereby eliminates 20 servers that were used before to distribute 25.6
TBs of data across the network .
Even more so , the P2P based solution speeded up this process significantly , from 4 days to only 4 hours .
The cost savings for those who use DistriBrute are immense .
Leo Blom , co-founder of 4M88 told TorrentFreak that they were able to cut 50 servers at ROCMN , another Dutch educational institution .
The costs to manage a server can get as high as $ 10,000 a year , but these will evaporate thanks to DistriBrute .
DistriBrute is one of the first commercial products for business use to reveal the true power of the BitTorrent protocol .
For now , availability is limited to organizations in The Netherlands , in the first quarter of 2009 it will be released internationally .
Now , show us the source code ... ;)
MySQL gets some love and the result is finally a phpMyAdmin replacement written in Ruby On Rails .
It 's name is rbDB and it's one of the apps that got built in 48 hours during this year 's Rails Rumble .
The project is currently in something like private alpha but hopefully the source code will be released soon .
Take a look at the official announcement and the screencast of rbDB and give it a try on the Rails Rumble deployment
Sometimes campaigns and candidates make the difference .
Very possibly , a different campaign or a different candidate could have won the presidency for the Democrats in 2004 .
( Most Republicans cited Dick Gephardt as the Democrat they feared most , John Kerry as the candidate they feared least . )
Not impossibly , as Bob Shrum suggests , a different vice presidential candidate might have helped Al Gore in 2000 .
But 2008 ?
On the cable chat shows , the interviewers ask : “ What ’s the one thing John McCain has to do to turn this thing around ? ”
“ Well Chris , two things that would really help would be a 5,000 point rise in the Dow and a 20 percent jump in home prices over the next three weeks .
Failing that , I suppose he might talk about the 1960 ’s some more . ”
Yes , the McCain campaign has been ghastly .
It cannot decipher what ails the U.S. economy and it offers no remedies .
All McCain has is a biography — at a time when voters are focused on their own lives , not the candidates ’ .
Baffled by a lack of enthusiasm for McCain ’s personal narrative , the campaign shifted its focus to the other candidate ’s biography .
Trouble is , Barack Obama ’s biography is not very interesting .
Hillary Clinton , at least , worked with actual radicals at a time when radicalism was a going concern .
But Obama ?
McCain ’s attack on him is the equivalent of the William McKinley campaign attacking William Jennings Bryan for having kept company with Nathan Bedford Forrest decades after the Civil War .
Yes , the old rebel was an unrepentant traitor .
Mostly though , he was all washed up .
Republicans have been fighting this second American civil war for eleven election cycles now .
It ’s been a good run !
But just as 19th - Century Republicans eventually ran out of Union generals from Ohio , so the modern Republican Party has bumped up against the statute of limitations on campaigns against hippies .
McCain needed a bigger message .
While nobody could have predicted that a global financial crisis would erupt in the fall of 2008 , it was observable a year ago that the incomes of the middle class had stagnated during the Bush years .
( I know because I observed it — in fact , in 2007 I published a whole book largely on this very point . )
McCain previously had expressed doubts about many Bush policies , from the tax cuts of 2001 to the administration ’s easy indulgence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2005 .
He could have continued that theme in 2007 and 2008 .
He could have campaigned as Nicholas Sarkozy to Bush ’s Jacques Chirac — a critic from within the party who offered change combined with practical experience and a moderate worldview .
Had McCain seized the middle in this way , his last - minute attempt to depict Barack Obama as an out - of - touch radical might have made sense .
After all , it is true that Barack Obama happily kept company with extreme characters in the days when he was contemplating a campaign for mayor of Chicago : not only the unrepentant bomber Bill Ayers , but also the flamboyant preacher Jeremiah Wright .
That truth , however , only becomes interesting when linked to a broader truth relevant to voters ’ lives .
Had McCain offered a meaningful economic message early on , he could now say : “ I want to solve this crisis — and I know how .
Barack Obama just wants to use the crisis to sell a lot of destructive social programs that nobody would accept if they had time to think about them . ”
The moment at which such a message became impossible for McCain was his decision to embrace the full re-enactment of Bush ’s tax cuts .
It must have seemed an easy decision back in the primary .
It was a litmus test for many conservative voters and , after all , with Democrats poised to expand their majorities in the next Congress , there was zero likelihood those tax cuts would ever be enacted .
Trouble is , by founding his campaign on a full supply - side message , McCain denied himself the opportunity to say anything new .
Worse , because that message originally took shape as a ( correct ) response to the problems of the 1970’s , McCain ’s attempt to dust it off and reuse it as a response to the very different problems of the 2010 ’s only made him look more out of date .
That ’s not a failure of campaign tactics .
It ’s not even a failure of strategy .
It ’s a failure of the Republican Party and conservative movement to adapt to the times .
Very soon , this election will be over .
Then Republicans and conservatives will confront a much harder question :
How long will this adaptation take ?
It took Democrats 12 years to understand and accept their defeat in 1980 .
Surely we can be faster learners ?
“ We are very excited she ( Palin ) has accepted our offer and we are very proud of the publicity she is generating for hockey moms and the sport of hockey . ” -- Comcast - Spectacor Chairman Ed Snider
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , the nation ’s most popular hockey mom , will join the winner of the Philadelphia Flyers regional search for the “ Ultimate Hockey Mom ” contest and drop the puck at the ceremonial opening face - off as the home team Flyers host the New York Rangers at the Wachovia Center on Saturday , October 11 at 7 p.m.

The Los Angeles Dodgers ’ batting lineup did n’t have much luck Wednesday .
But the team ’s fan lineup in Dodger Stadium ’s Section 11 , Row N certainly did .
In the bottom of the fifth inning Glen Walker in Seat 1 caught a pop foul hit by Dodger first baseman James Loney .
On the next pitch by the New York Mets ’ John Maine , Joe Castro in Seat 2 caught a line - shot fouled off Loney ’s bat .
The crowd in the field - level seats between third base and home went wild .

“ It was the weirdest thing , ” said Walker , 50 , of Redondo Beach .
“ The ball went straight up and came down fast .
I caught it on a short hop .
I had a baseball glove in my car , but I did n’t bring it into the stadium with me .
When the ball was coming at me , I wished I had . ”
Castro , 43 , of Long Beach , was high - fiving Walker when the sharp whack of Loney ’s bat signaled another foul coming the pair ’s way .
It hit the scoreboard on the second - level facade , then bounced into Castro ’s hand .
He was glove - less too .
“ It was crazy .
Everybody was in disbelief .
People around us were yelling , ‘ Did we just see that ? ’
They were blown away .
A guy across the aisle came back from the snack bar and asked if he ’d missed anything and we held up our foul balls .
He could n’t believe it , ” said Castro , an insurance broker .
By the game ’s end , the pair were clutching their baseballs and trying to calculate the odds of back - to - back fouls landing side - by - side in the stands .
Advertisement
“ It ’s got to be one in 10 million , ” decided Castro .
“ It has to be millions to one , ” said Walker , who is a reporter and news anchor at television stations KCBS - 2 and KCAL - 9 .
Baseball aficionados have estimated the odds of a fan catching a foul ball at a typical major league game as ranging from one in 884 to one in 1,189 .
Variables such as crowd size and stadium configuration make exact projections difficult .
But USC mathematics professor Kenneth Alexander used Wednesday ’s Dodger Stadium crowd size and game statistics -- 40,696 in attendance and a foul ball count of 48 -- to postulate the odds against Walker and Castro catching back - to - back fouls .
Calculating that only one of 18 pitches were fouled into the stands ( other fouls stayed on the playing field ) and factoring in the six fans sitting close by the pair , Alexander fielded the problem .
Advertisement
“ One in 10,000 is the probability ” that the pair would catch two fouls in a row , he concluded .
He cautioned , however , that his specialty is probability theory in mathematical physics .
With Wednesday ’s 12 - 1 loss to the Mets , the Dodgers are probably wishing mathematical physics could tell them the probability that they ’ll soon regain their momentum .

Chrissy Mazzeo Files Lawsuit Against Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons
has filed a lawsuit in Federal court against Nevada Governor .
She is charging battery , false imprisonment and second degree kidnapping as well as lying about the incident after the fact .
The suit comes two years after the alleged incident which took place on October 13 , 2006 .
Mazzeo , 34 , was a cocktail waitress in Las Vegas at the time of their encounter .
She alleges , in her lawsuit , that the pair were drinking with a group of people at a restaurant .
The two ended up in a parking garage where he grabbed her and forced her against a wall and said , " I 'm going to rape you . "
The story broke at the time of the incident , a short while before Gibbons was elected to his first term as Nevada 's governor .
Clark County D.A. David Roger would n't prosecute at the time because the charges could not be proved " beyond a reasonable doubt " .
Mazzeo's lawsuit alleges a cover up conspiracy by political operative Sig Rogich , the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department , former police chief Bill Young and former Gibbons attorney Don Campbell .
The suit has been filed by Las Vegas attorney Robert Kossack , who has been hired to represent Mazzeo .
She held a news conference in late 2006 where she reported that she had been threatened , pressured and offered money through an intermediary to change her story .
Mazzeo has since relocated to Southern California to pursue an acting career .
Her resume lists her special talents as improvisation and a spirit of adventure .
Gibbons , 63 , recently filed for divorce from his wife of 22 years , Dawn Gibbon , 54 .
She accused her husband of being involved with another woman .

The city council of San Francisco has issued an ordinance that pharmacies are not allowed to sell tobacco products .
The intent is to eliminate mixed messages about a pharmacy , ostensibly devoted to healing people , selling unhealthy tobacco .
But two companies are suing the city of San Francisco in federal court to overturn the ban .
The first , Walgreens , is suing because only stand - alone pharmacies are affected by the ban – grocery stories and big - box stores with pharmacies are not affected .
Their legal logic is that the tobacco sales ban is discriminatory toward stand - alone pharmacies , and they have a point .
Whether it ’ll hold up in court is another question ( the federal judge refused to delay the ban , due to start on October 1 , while the lawsuit is being heard ) , and one I ’ll not even attempt to address .
The second company , Philip Morris , is suing using a totally different legal logic .
They say it ’s an unconstitutional abridgment of their First Amendment right to free speech .
In 2003 , the Supreme Court dismissed Nike , Inc. , et al , Petitioners v. Marc Kasky ( with dissents on the dismissal by Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy ) .
According to the dismissal concurrence ( linked above ) , the case essentially involved a private California citizen ( Marc Kasky ) suing Nike for unfair and deceptive practices under California ’s Unfair Competition Law , specifically that “ Nike made a number of ‘ false statements and / or material omissions of fact ’ concerning the working conditions under which Nike products are manufactured . ”
Nike ’s response was that Kasky ’s suit was unconstitutional since Nike had a First Amendment right ( ostensibly guaranteed by its status as a juristic person ) to say anything it wanted in its “ commercial speech ” ( ie advertising ) .
The Supreme Court initially granted , and then subsequently dismissed without deciding the constitutional questions , a hearing on this issue .
According to the San Francisco Chronicle article , Philip Morris is claiming that “ ‘… the purpose and effect of the ordinance is to suppress communications directed to adult smokers , in violation of our constitutional rights ’ , said Joe Murillo , a lawyer representing Philip Morris USA . ”
Understandably , the director of the city ’s Department of Public Health , Mitch Katz , is not impressed :
“ Do you remember any part of the Bill of Rights being about pharmacies selling tobacco ? ” he asked .
“ Philip Morris has fought every attempt by public health officials to save lives by curbing smoking …
It ’s a badge of honor for anyone in public health to be sued by Philip Morris ”
It ’s probably not a coincidence that Philip Morris is suing in California , the same state that brought the question of corporate personhood and First Amendment protections for commercial speech before the Supreme Court previously .
California was one of the first states to adopt false advertising legislation ( Sections 17500 - 17509 of California State Law ) , and California ’s restrictions on both advertising and unfair competition are quite strict .
In addition , California is the nation ’s largest single market and as such it drives much of the nation ’s regulations ( which is why energy and automobile companies fight tooth and claw against California ’s strict carbon emissions law , among others ) .
A win in California would have a great deal of influence on regulations throughout the rest of the country , including at the federal level with the Federal Trade Commission ’s Bureau of Consumer Protection – Advertising Practices Division .

On the back porch , he found an old pair of sneakers .
He stripped down to his T - shirt and underwear , laced up the shoes , and started running .
It seemed like a good idea at the time .
He sobered up in Daly City , about 15 miles south .
It was nearly four in the morning .
The air was cool , slightly damp from the fog , and Karnazes was in a residential neighborhood , burping tequila , with no pants on .
He felt ridiculous , but it brought a smile to his face .
He had n't had this much fun in a long time .
So he decided to keep running .
When the sun came up , Karnazes was trotting south along Route 1 , heading toward Santa Cruz .
He had covered 30 miles .
In the process , he'd had a blinding realization :
There were untapped reservoirs within him .
It was like a religious conversion .
He had been born again as a long - distance runner .
More than anything else now , he wanted to find out how far he could go .
But at that exact moment , what he really needed to do was stop .
He called his wife from a pay phone , and an hour later she found him in the parking lot of a 7 - Eleven .
He passed out in the car on the way home .
That was August 1992 .
Over the next 14 years , Karnazes challenged almost every known endurance running limit .
He covered 350 miles without sleeping .
( It took more than three days . )
He ran the first and only marathon to the South Pole ( finishing second ) , and a few months ago , at age 44 , he completed 50 marathons in 50 consecutive days , one in each of the 50 states .
( The last one was in New York City .
After that , he decided to run home to San Francisco . )
Karnazes ' transformation from a tequila - sodden party animal into an international symbol of human achievement is as educational as it is inspirational .
Here 's his advice for pushing athletic performance from the unthinkable to the untouchable .
1. BE AUDACIOUS
Finding the right challenge is the first challenge .
" Any goal worth achieving involves an element of risk , " Karnazes says in his autobiography , Ultramarathon Man : Confessions of an All - Night Runner .
Risk , yes , and creativity too .
For instance , looking for the ultimate endurance running challenge , in 1995 Karnazes entered a 199 - mile relay race – by himself .
He competed against eight teams of 12 and finished eighth .
2. GO LACELESS
One of the biggest annoyances in long - distance running is lace management .
After banging out 50 miles , it can be hard to squat or even bend over long enough to tie your shoes .
The North Face recently responded to Karnazes ' complaints and came out with the $ 130 M Endurus XCR Boa .
Its laceless upper is enmeshed in thin steel cables that connect to a tension dial at the back .
A simple turn cinches the shoe onto the foot .
No more slowing down to fiddle with laces .
3. FLIRT WITH DISASTER
In 1995 , Karnazes ran his first Badwater Ultramarathon , a 135 - mile trek that starts in Death Valley , California , in the middle of summer and finishes at the Mt. Whitney Portals , 8,360 feet above sea level .
After running 72 miles in 120 - degree heat , Karnazes collapsed on the side of the road suffering from hallucinations , diarrhea , and nausea .
He had pushed himself to the point of death to find out whether he was strong enough to survive .
He was .
Though he did n't finish the race that year , Karnazes came back the next and placed 10th .
He won it on his fifth attempt , in 2004 .
" Somewhere along the line , we seem to have confused comfort with happiness , " he says .
4. EAT JUNK – LOTS OF IT
You would n't believe the stuff Karnazes consumes on a run .
He carries a cell phone and regularly orders an extra-large Hawaiian pizza .
The delivery car waits for him at an intersection , and when he gets there he grabs the pie and rams the whole thing down his gullet on the go .
The trick : Roll it up for easy scarfing .
He 'll chase the pizza with cheesecake , cinnamon buns , chocolate éclairs , and all - natural cookies .
The high - fat pig - out fuels Karnazes ' long jaunts , which can burn more than 9,000 calories a day .
What he needs is massive amounts of energy , and fat contains roughly twice as many calories per gram as carbohydrates .
Hence , pizza and éclairs .
When he's not in the midst of some record - breaking exploit , Karnazes maintains a monkish diet , eating grilled salmon five nights a week .
He strictly avoids processed sugars and fried foods – no cookies or doughnuts .
He even tries to steer clear of too much fruit because it contains a lot of sugar .
He believes this approach – which nutritionists call a slow - carb diet – has reshaped him , lowering his body fat and building lean muscle .
It also makes him look forward to running a race , because he can eat whatever he wants .
5. CUT BACK ON SLEEP
Karnazes has a wife and two kids , and he worked a 9 - to - 5 job for the first eight years of his quest to transcend his own limits .
Finding four hours for a 30 - mile run during the day was next to impossible .
The solution : sleep less .
" Forgoing sleep is the only way I 've figured out how to fit it all in , " he says , noting that running in the dark can be soothing .
Plus , there 's less traffic to contend with .
He now gets about four hours of shut - eye a night .
Before he started running , however , he was just a regular guy who got a regular eight .
As he started to run more , he found that he could sleep less .
The National Sleep Foundation reports that exercise does lead to more restful sleep , and Karnazes takes this idea to the extreme .
" The human body , " he says , " is capable of extraordinary feats . "
6. SHOW YOUR BODY WHO'S BOSS
" The human body has limitations , " Karnazes says .
" The human spirit is boundless . "
Your mind , in other words , is your most important muscle .
As a running buddy told him : " Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention to arrive safely in a pretty and well - preserved body , but rather to skid in broadside , thoroughly used up , totally worn out , and loudly proclaiming : Wow !!
What a ride ! "
7. GET A COOL WATCH
Karnazes wears a souped - up Timex that monitors his speed , distance , calories burned , and elevation , all of which is critical for deciding when to order the next pizza while in the midst of a 200 - mile trek .
Besides letting him order a pie on the run , his cell phone uses specialized GPS software to broadcast his location to the Internet for all to see .
It 's fun to follow his icon rolling across the digital landscape , but it's also useful when Karnazes disappears into the night .
If he ever pushes himself too hard and collapses , his people can locate him .
And fans would know something was wrong if his signal landed on top of a hospital icon .
8. LEARN TO LOVE KRAZY GLUE
If something goes wrong – and it inevitably will – it's usually with Karnazes ' feet .
In races and on training runs , he has battled giant , foot - devouring blisters .
A surprisingly effective treatment : Krazy Glue .
Pop the blister , slather the wound with the super - adhesive , and voilà – your foot is ready to take a beating again .
The glue acts as a kind of indestructible second skin and has helped Karnazes finish competitions he would n't have otherwise .
( Officially , Krazy Glue recommends avoiding all contact with skin . )
9. GET USED TO IT
If you 're going to explore the boundaries of human endurance , you 'll have to learn to adapt to more and more pain .
To prepare for the searing heat of the Badwater race , Karnazes went on 30 - mile jogs wearing a ski parka over a wool sweater .
He trained himself to urinate while running .
He got so he could go out and run a marathon on any given day – no mileage buildup or tapering required .
This training made the extreme seem ordinary and made the impossible seem the next logical step .
Eventually , when he grew accustomed to the pain , it stopped hurting .
" There is magic in misery , " he says .
10 . PROMOTE THE HELL OUT OF YOURSELF
Before he became Superman , Karnazes was the Clark Kent of the PR world : a humdrum marketing executive at a pharmaceutical company .
But in the past three years , he 's published a memoir , nabbed a sponsorship from the North Face , appeared on Late Show With David Letterman , and gotten himself on the cover of a handful of magazines .
The book and the North Face contract generate enough money to support his family , and the high profile translates into maximum motivation : Failure is scarier when the family income is on the line .
11 . BREAK IT DOWN
Fifty - six miles into his first Western States Endurance Run – one of the oldest 100 - mile races in the country – Karnazes found himself alone entering a canyon at twilight .
It was tough going – the trek boasts a total elevation change of 38,000 feet .
With 44 miles to go , his spirit was flagging , but he found a way to make it seem conquerable :
He remembered the next checkpoint would leave only a marathon and two 10Ks left to go .
He knew he could run each leg , and that helped him achieve the whole .
12 . AVOID KRYPTONITE
Forget tequila .
Karnazes has given up hard drinking .
His big vice these days : chocolate - covered espresso beans .

Last week , Microsoft was kind enough to invite me to sit down , one - on - one with Horacio Gutierrez , the company 's VP and Deputy General Counsel in charge of intellectual property and licensing .
As you might imagine , given my views on the patent system in general , and Microsoft 's gradual embrace of the patent system specifically , he and I disagreed on a fair amount .
We agreed that the patent system should be focused on encouraging innovation .
We agreed that there were abuses of the system .
From there , our views pretty much diverged , though the conversation was fun and lively .
Gutierrez began the conversation by focusing on all of the " benefits " that Microsoft sees to the patent system , which focused on all of the licensing deals that the company has done .
He positioned it by noting that the patent portfolio allows the Microsoft to get into deeper business relationships with other entities .
Specifically , he noted that in many cases what began as a patent licensing discussion eventually leads to a much more complete business relationship that increases interoperability .
He cited deals with both Sun and Novell as examples of this .
The problem , of course , is that this ignores how these deals actually began .
Rather than approaching each other over mutually beneficial relationships , they really involve an implicit threat .
That is , Microsoft shows up with its big patent portfolio ( or , let 's say , a big pointy stick ) and says " hey , let 's make a deal , or I 'll jab you with the pointy stick . "
Yes , that can obviously lead to further business deals , but it 's not about two companies entering into a relationship willingly for mutual benefit .
It 's all based on a rather clear threat .
The fallacy that Gutierrez laid out is that these sorts of relationships and interoperability are impossible to come by without the use of that pointy stick .
That 's difficult to believe .
If the relationships really are mutually beneficial , then they are likely to come about in a much more friendly manner anyway .
When I pointed out ( literally ) that Microsoft coming to companies with a big stick did n't seem like the friendliest of business negotiations , Gutierrez suggested that you " need " the stick to make the conversations work .
On that we disagree , and there 's a pretty long history of companies entering into mutually beneficial relationships that do n't necessarily involve the threat of a lawsuit or government granted monopolies on processes .
Gutierrez also pointed out that any complex product these days , by its very nature , will violate numerous patents from numerous other companies and individuals .
Thus , his argument is that we really should focus on mechanisms to avoid lawsuits to allow those products to move forward .
Thus , licensing is preferable to lawsuits .
That 's true , but misses the point .
The fact that no complex product can be brought to market without violating numerous patents should be seen as , rather than a truism that is solved through licensing .
Let 's fix the problem that makes it so difficult for products to get to market without paying a " tax " to other companies , and figure out ways to let companies innovate freely and compete in the marketplace .
I was somewhat surprised to also hear Gutierrez claim that because of this " patent thicket " situation these days , you could n't innovate without patents .
I interrupted him to point out that this was ridiculous on its face , as Microsoft 's own history showed .
His response was that the situation had changed as the interpretation of both copyright and patent law over the past couple of decades had changed , such that protections that the company hadit had in the early years did n't really exist , and additional rulings made it clear that other protections would be useful .
Needless to say , I find that unconvincing .
There 's plenty of evidence that a ton of innovation occurred when software companies focused on the market , rather than on ownership of ideas .
Gutierrez also insisted on pointing out that Microsoft 's rather massive patent portfolio had been voted by some third party to be one of , if not the , best patent portfolios in terms of .
He suggested that other firms , such as IBM , were more likely to file very questionable patents , but Microsoft was much more focused on quality .
Perhaps that 's a subjective measure , but given how many questionable Microsoft patents we see around here all the time , some may beg to differ -- or at least point out that some questionable patents are getting through .
In discussing all of this with Gutierrez , I brought up the company 's continual FUD campaign , where it goes to the press to wave that pointy stick around , in announcing that Linux violates over 200 Microsoft patents .
Gutierrez noted that he was among the Microsoft execs who had made those statements , and he stood by them , claiming that Richard Stallman agrees , and falling back on his earlier claim of all complex products violating some patents , which is why he says they just want Linux vendors to work out some sort of patent licensing agreement .
That , of course , does n't answer the question of why Microsoft keeps screaming about patent infringement , but never bothers to show what patents anyone infringes on .
Finally , we did have a fun conversation on the historical and macro level impacts of patent systems throughout history , where he asserted that perhaps the reason so many countries have found faster innovation in eras of fewer patents was because it makes sense to ignore patents during developmental phases , but after that to put protections in place .
I pointed out that it seemed difficult to believe that there was some fundamental shift in economics that meant patents made sense at one time , but not at another -- but by then we were running out of time to discuss things .
On the whole , however , I 'll say that we had a spirited discussion on the role of the patent system in encouraging innovation .
More than once , we agreed that the conversation might have been more fun if we were having it around a couple of beers , rather than a Microsoft conference table .
While I do n't think either of us changed each other 's minds , I did appreciate the chance to sit down and discuss these issues face to face on the record , and I hope to have a chance to continue the discussion in the future .
I can understand where he is coming from and what Microsoft 's position on the matter is , but you have to admit , as the holder of a bigger pointy stick than most other participants , Microsoft may be more inclined than others to be a big supporter of being allowed to use the big pointy stick .

IN the summer of 1983 , I became President Ronald Reagan ’s special representative to the Middle East , with the mission of restoring a measure of calm to Israel ’s relations with her neighbors , starting with Lebanon .
At the time , Lebanon was occupied by Syrian and Israeli forces 
Syria since shortly after Lebanon ’s civil war began in 1975 , and Israel since its invasion in June of the previous year .
Scarcely three months into that assignment , however , I was recalled to Washington and named the president ’s national security adviser .
Just after midnight on Friday , Oct. 21 , I was awakened by a call from Vice President George H. W. Bush , who reported that several East Caribbean states had asked the United States to send forces to the Caribbean island of Grenada to prevent the Soviet Union and Cuba from establishing a base there .
I called the president and Secretary of State George Shultz , who were on a golfing trip in Augusta , Ga. , and received approval to have our forces prepare to land within 72 hours .
Then , less than 24 hours later I was awakened again , this time by the duty officer at the White House situation room , who reported that United States Marine barracks in Lebanon had been attacked by Iranian - trained Hezbollah terrorists with heavy losses .
Again , I called the president , and he prepared for an immediate return to Washington to deal with both crises .
Today is the 25th anniversary of that bombing , which killed 241 Americans who were part of a multinational peacekeeping force ( a simultaneous attack on the French base killed 58 paratroopers ) .
The attack was planned over several months at Hezbollah ’s training camp in the Bekaa Valley in central Lebanon .
Once American intelligence confirmed who was responsible and where the attack had been planned , President Reagan approved a joint French - American air assault on the camp  only to have the mission aborted just before launching by the secretary of defense , Caspar Weinberger .
Four months later , all the marines were withdrawn , capping one of the most tragic and costly policy defeats in the brief modern history of American counterterrorism operations .
Hi , everyone , there have been reports about the battery life of the new PSP system ( PSP - 3000 ) being shorter than the current model ( PSP - 2000 ) , following an interview we recently did with Gamespot .
I ’d like to make a correction and clarify that the new PSP will have equivalent battery life to the current PSP , about 4 to 6 hours for games and about 4 to 5 hours for UMD videos .
While the enhanced screen of the new PSP draws a little more power , our engineers in Japan worked to reduce the power consumption of the overall system including its components , so you wo n’t have to worry about losing any time when enjoying the more vibrant visuals displayed with the new PSP .
We hope this clears everything up , and we ’re certainly excited about letting you all get your hands on the new PSP and checking out the enhanced screen when it hits retail next month .
White House contenders go nuclear a month from election day Agence France - Presse

Print This Email This Democrat Barack Obama , responding to his portrayal by John McCain 's campaign as a crony of " terrorists , " fought fire with fire Monday by highlighting the Republican 's embroilment in a devastating 1980s financial scandal .
A month from election day on November 4 , the rivals traded furious barbs as Arizona Senator McCain battled to arrest his Illinois opponent 's poll surge at a time of deep anxiety about the state of the US economy .
Obama rolled out a new advertisement and email onslaught recalling McCain 's complicity in the scandal over jailed tycoon Charles Keating , the collapse of whose savings and loan firm wiped out the savings of many elderly retirees .
McCain was part of a group of lawmakers that became known as the " Keating Five " that received gifts and favors from the businessman and intervened with regulators to insist his company was in good health .
The Republican escaped with a formal censure by the Senate in 1991 but spoke of the searing embarrassment caused by the scandal , which cost the US government 124 billion dollars to bail out the entire savings and loan industry , and went on to become a crusader for ethics reform .
" Sound familiar ? " Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said in an email to supporters , after Congress last week passed a 700 - billion - dollar bailout for Wall Street .
" The McCain campaign has tried to avoid talking about the scandal , but with so many parallels to the current crisis , McCain 's Keating history is relevant and voters deserve to know the facts -- and see for themselves the pattern of poor judgment by John McCain , " he said .
The war of words sparked by McCain 's running mate Sarah Palin raised the stakes still higher as the presidential contenders prepared to face off at the second of three debates on Tuesday .
Alaska Governor Palin Saturday accused Obama of " palling around with terrorists , " a reference to his ties in Chicago to former militant William Ayers , whose " Weathermen " group bombed government buildings in the 1960s and 1970s .
Palin told supporters the Democrat was thus " not a man who sees America as you and I do , as the greatest force for good in the world . "
That remark appeared to underline that the Hawaii - born Obama , the first African - American with a serious shot at the presidency , does not resemble the average white voter .
But while the McCain campaign insists it will not play the race card against Obama , it does intend to portray him as a wild - eyed liberal who is out of step with heartland values and unfit to lead .
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds alleged that university professor Ayers was part of a network of Chicago patrons including convicted fraudster Antoin " Tony " Rezko , a property tycoon who used to be a top fundraiser for Obama .
" The last four weeks of this election will be about whether the American people are willing to turn our economy and national security over to Barack Obama , a man with little record , questionable judgment , and ties to radical figures like unrepentant domestic terrorist William Ayers , " he said .
Obama hit back at the terrorist jab with another television spot that castigated the 72 - year - old McCain 's " erratic " behavior as Congress warred last week over the economic rescue package .
The ad noted that top McCain advisor Greg Strimple had said the Republican 's campaign was " looking forward to turning a page on this financial crisis " and instead attack Obama 's " aggressively liberal record . "
The Illinois senator , 47 , said he would not fall prey to the kind of " Swift Boat " character assassination that helped to sink 2004 nominee John Kerry 's campaign to unseat President George W. Bush .
" They 'd rather tear our campaign down than lift this country up .
That 's what you do when you 're out of touch , out of ideas , and running out of time , " Obama told a giant crowd of 28,000 people Sunday in Asheville , North Carolina .
Instead , Obama said he would hammer away at bread - and - butter issues including America 's health care crisis , with the US economy staring at recession after shedding 760,000 jobs so far this year .
With crisis sweeping through Wall Street and Main Street , polls now favor Obama both nationally and in battleground states such as Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania .
A USA Today / MTV / Gallup survey published Monday showed Obama now leads McCain 61 percent to 32 percent among registered voters under 30 years of age .
However , McCain had a four - percentage - point advantage among seniors 65 and older .
Meanwhile , The Wall Street Journal on Monday quoted Republican Party officials as saying they will file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission Monday asking for an audit of Obama 's campaign contributions .
They Republicans said they were concerned that the Democratic candidate might be accepting donations from foreign nationals and exceeding federal limits for individual donations .

I ’ll be discussing the architecture of the application and the reasons behind the design decisions .
Of course , in order to do that , I need an application .
More specifically , I need an application for which I know all the reasons behind the design decisions .
So , I ’m going to write one , and I ’m not a person to buck a tradition , so I ’m going to write a blog .
I ’ll be documenting the process here , and you can see the blog live here .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) -
The Japanese government will have to pay damages to the parents of a sailor who hanged himself after being repeatedly insulted by his superior , in the first such court ruling involving a civil servant , media said .

The Fukuoka High Court in southern Japan ordered 3.5 million yen ( $ 32,000 ) be paid to the parents of the petty officer third class , a court spokesman said , declining to give further details .
Kyodo news agency said the court recognized that the sailor ’s suicide had been caused by depression , a result of stress accumulated from insults such as : “ You are not qualified as a petty officer third class ” and “ Are you dumb ? ”
The sailor had been 21 when he committed suicide aboard a destroyer in 1999 , it said .
A lower court had ruled in the government ’s favor , saying the remarks from the sailor ’s superior had fallen within the scope of training , Kyodo added .
“ It is disappointing that the court did not understand the state ’s claim , ” an official at the defense ministry quoted Vice Defence Minister Kohei Masuda as telling a news conference .
“ We will closely study the decision and deal with it appropriately . ”
Japan ’s defense ministry has been hit by a string of scandals in recent years , including cases of bribery and security leaks .
Cases of bullying in companies and in schools have also made headlines in recent years .

Asked when he thought attacks by Hindu mobs against Christians would end in this remote part of eastern India , local Christian leader Ranjit Nayak replied immediately , and with a resigned smile .
" March , " Nayak said , referring to a general election due in early 2009 .
" This is all totally politically motivated . "
Like many Christians , human rights groups and government ministers , Nayak suspected hardline Hindu groups of organising these attacks in Orissa state , trying to win political support among Hindus over long - standing tensions with missionaries .
From attacks on Christians to suspected Islamist bombings , communal politics is back on the agenda across India , to challenge an embattled secular - leaning government as its gears up for an election against a Hindu- nationalist opposition in 2009 .
The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) is trying to take the political offensive , campaigning here in Orissa state on issues such as missionary conversion , or convincing Hindus in other states of the risks from militant Muslims .
The ruling Congress , under pressure to ban Hindu hardline groups and get tough on Islamist terrorism , is struggling both to avoid alienating Hindu voters while also securing its traditional support among minorities , including Muslims .
The government held a meeting on Monday of the National Integration Council , a panel of public figures , to discuss communal tension , the first time the group has met since 2005 .
" It is not by accident that these incidents are increasing , " Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the council .
" We need to collectively consider whether short - term narrow political ends are driving some of us to encourage forces of divisiveness . "
Attacks in Orissa and bombings by suspected Islamist militants that have killed hundreds have dominated media and political debates in the last month .
Muslim leaders accuse the police of indiscriminate arrests and even murders of Muslim youth as they try to show they are catching terrorists .

GM , IBM , Chevron and Exxon are all Dow components .
All 30 Dow stocks fell .
Other big Dow losers included financial components Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and JP Morgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) .
Former Dow component AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) plunged 25 % on late Wednesday reports it is taking a Fed loan of up to $ 37.8 billion .
The insurance giant already received an $ 85 billion Fed loan last month that helped it skirt bankruptcy .
Other financial stocks slumped as well , with Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) and Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) both losing 26 % after the three - week old short - selling ban was lifted late Wednesday .
In short - selling , traders place bets that a stock will fall .
The SEC banned the shorting of nearly 800 financial stocks after critics said it added to the accelerated bloodletting in financial stocks in the summer and early fall .
Credit markets frozen : Amid the ongoing crisis , lending has dried up , making it difficult for businesses to function on a daily basis and for consumers to get loans .
In an effort to get money moving again , the government has taken a number of dramatic steps , including announcing an emergency interest - rate cut Wednesday , coordinated with banks around the world .
Earlier in the week , the Fed said it will buy short - term debt needed to finance daily operations directly from businesses .
It also said it will make $ 300 billion available to banks in return for damaged assets , on top of $ 300 billion already available .
And Congress approved the $ 700 billion bank bailout plan last Friday .
But despite all these developments , credit markets have barely budged .

The TED spread , the difference between what banks pay to borrow from each other for three months and what the Treasury pays , spiked to an all - time high of 4.23 % Thursday .
The wider the spread , the more reluctant banks are to lend to each other , rather than from the federal government .
When markets are fairly calm , banks charge each other premiums that are not much higher than the U.S. government .
The yield on the 3 - month Treasury bill , seen by many as the safest place to put money in the short term , fell to 0.5 % Thursday from 0.64 % late Wednesday .
Last month , the yield on the 3 - month bill skidded to a 68 - year low around 0 % as panicked investors fled equities , accepting virtually no return on their money rather than risk losing it in the stock market .

In exclusive , never - before - seen footage , former CIA operative E. Howard Hunt discusses his knowledge of and participation in the plot to kill Kennedy in a video testimony he gave shortly before his death .
Alex Jones ’ upcoming film will fully analyze the CIA - shadow government coup that occurred inside the United States 45 years ago .
Rolling Stone and a few other publications have covered Hunt ’s audio confession ( released in April 2007 ) , but no one has yet seen the information the infamous White House ‘ plumber ’ left behind to shed light on the figures involved in the plot .
Here , Howard Hunt discusses LBJ , who saw Kennedy as an ‘ obstacle ’ to the presidency .
According to Hunt , LBJ consorted with top CIA officials Cord Meyer and William K. Harvey to carry out the plot .

Tactics to deny Americans the right to vote are as old as , well , the right to vote .
Democrats have been at fault in the past — take the literacy tests Southern states used to deprive blacks of their suffrage from the Civil War up through 1965 .
Today ’s shenanigans — which still target minorities and vulnerable first - time voters — are more often designed to stifle Democratic turnout , perhaps never more than in 2008 .
“ This is obviously an important election , and the turnout may break records , ” says Rice University sociologist Chandler Davidson , who has studied vote suppression , “ so there is every reason to expect these tactics will be employed . ”
Card the Centenarian
Arizona ‘s Proposition 200 , passed in 2004 , makes would - be voters prove their citizenship with a passport , birth certificate , or other federal ID , but poor and elderly citizens often lack such proof .
One 97 - year - old woman who cast her first vote for fdr in 1932 had to wage a nine - month campaign to regain her voting rights after relocating from Kentucky .
Lawyer Linda Brown of the Arizona Advocacy Network , part of a coalition suing to disable Prop. 200 , says activists are dubbing Arizona “ the state of Darwinist democracy .
If you ’ve got the stamina and an insatiable desire , you just may be able to register and vote before you die . ”
Similar battles are playing out in Georgia , Michigan , Missouri , Utah , and Indiana , which saw its ID law upheld by the US Supreme Court in April , despite evidence that up to 43,000 citizens lacked the necessary ID — including a dozen retired nuns turned away from the polls during primary season .

Playing With Matches
Four states — Florida , Iowa , Louisiana , and South Dakota — only let residents register if their Social Security or driver ’s license numbers can be matched with entries in a state database .
If you register as “ Bill ” but the database says “ William , ” or if a data - entry clerk sticks a typo in your name or birth date , tough luck .
sleaze meter : 3 Incompetence may be bipartisan , but critics argue that there will be more typos in the names of Hispanics , immigrants , and black women .

Prior Restraint
Felon disenfranchisement is the mother of all anti-suffrage tactics .
When George W. Bush took Floridaby a few hundred votes in 2000 , more than 600,000 state residents had been barred from voting because of prior offenses .
Florida has since made it easier for some ex-felons to regain their rights , and several other states have tinkered with their laws .
Even so , more than 5 million Americans will be unable to vote this fall because of felony records .
sleaze meter : 9 Because of disproportionate drug law enforcement , as many as 1 in 8 black men nationwide is excluded from the political process .

Armed and Dangerous
Kentucky Republicans have been challenging the voting status of black residents in a variety of ways for decades .
In 2004 , following a contentious gubernatorial election , a voter - advocacy group reported that party members had “ planned and organized what they hoped would be a well - publicized effort to place white Republicans primarily at black Democratic polling places , ostensibly to protect against vote fraud . ”

Counting Crows
In 2007 , a group called the Citizens Equal Rights Alliance ( cera ) unsuccessfully sued the state of Montana , arguing that polling places should be removed from the Crow Indian Reservation to prevent fraud .
Native Americans in other states have also reported intimidation ; allegations include gop poll workers copying down license plate numbers and following voters home .

When a Robo Calls
Malicious robo-calls during the 2006 congressional elections sent would - be voters to the wrong locations or harassed them at all hours .
In California ‘s 50th District , residents got late - night calls that seemed to be from Democrat Francine Busby ; when people hung up , the computer redialed up to 14 times .

Political Hacks
High - tech voting continues to wreak havoc across the country .
Monitors expect huge lines this November in Ohio ‘s poorer precincts , some of which have bounced from one flawed technology to another ; voters in Cuyahoga County will be on their fourth system since 2004 , notes Dan Tokaji , an associate law professor at the Ohio State University .
In 2006 , touch - screen machines in Sarasota , Florida , came up 18,000 votes short during a congressional race that was decided by fewer than 400 votes .
In 2007 , University of California researchers successfully hacked into three state - sanctioned e-voting systems , compelling election officials to abandon the pricey machines .
And during this year ’s gop primary , e-voting machines failed in 80 percent of the precincts in South Carolina ‘s Horry County .

Weapons of Mass Mailing
The Jim Crow - era trick known as “ caging ” has been revived by 21st - century gop operatives .
Mass mailings go out to low - income areas , and if a letter is returned as undeliverable , the party uses it to challenge that voter ’s eligibility .
Besides intimidating voters , the challenges create mayhem at polling stations .

From NetEase ( 1 & 2 ) :
Law enforcers break the law , hurt and kill people .
October 11 , around 10 pm at night , six Harbin City railway police beat to death Harbin City Sports Academy student , Lin Songling .
At the time , the railway police were in plain clothes had a quarrel with the dead victim Lin , who was waiting for some classmates at entrance to Harbin entertainment center Candy bar / nightclub [ Box Club / Club of Box ] .
Then the six police carried the dead victim Lin to a place 80 m away from the bar / nightclub , unclothed the dead victim Lin ’s shirt and cruelly beat him to death .
They also screamed : “ Do you still know people ?
I will see who you know , there will be no problem even if I beat you to death ! ”
Just like this , the life of a 22 - year - old young man who has not yet done anything in life was ended !!
Regrettable !!!
Comments on NetEase :
A hooligan with a license !!!
Waiting for your resignation .
“ Ding ” this up .
if this is true , punish the police .
If it is n’t , then punish the “ lou zhu . ”
Resign , hmph , resigning after beating someone to is enough to solve the problem ?
At least go to jail .
Today is the second day , the body is still on the streets , it will be very difficult to easily resolve this without punishing them .
Use the truth to speak , send this to more media !
Again China , sad , sad ah , with this kind of country , how do you want your citizens to live ?
Only anger !
In the morning , the traffic police sealed off the street crime scene ( Xi da zhi jie ) , so cars had to make a detour .
There were a huge group of people at the crime scene , also saw wreathes , the surrounding intersections all had traffic police .
I specially listened to the traffic report thinking there would be details , but the host only simply said , “ ‘ Xi da zhi jie ’ has traffic … ”
Just like this , a 22 - year - old life is gone …
Savage police !!!
I am a Harbin person … Harbin police and Harbin ’s black society are all “ TMD ” the same ~ ~ ~
Harbin police meeting Harbin black society is like meeting their grandfather ~ ~ ~
Fuck their mother , crap attitudes and crap society ~ ~ ~
It is true , I passed by this morning , there were some people around looking , wreaths placed in the middle of the road , the police surrounding and maintaining order .
The dead victim ’s body was placed at the side of the road , hope the police are punished severely no matter who was right or wrong .
Six police beating one university student , until death , they are even more black than black society .
This really makes us ordinary common people feel unsafe .
Can this kind of police protect the ordinary common people ?
This type of police were trained through torturing prisoners , in prison they use their shoes to beat prisoner ’s faces .
Coming out , they still believe hitting people and insulting people is correct .
This is occupational inertia .
This happens a lot , it is not strange .
The impression police give me :
Hooligan scum = one part entered prison + one part became police + one part friends of police .
I have never expressed what I think on a discussion forum , but I must say something now !!
I do not know why the media does not go report this matter , a case involving human life is the most important !!!
6 beasts tore off a youth ’s upper body clothes and beat him to death .
Where is the justice ?
Do us ordinary people still have any place to voice ourselves !!!
This matter happened right near my home , absolutely true .
I hope everything with a heart will “ ding ” this up , so the child will not have died for nothing !!!
Everyone who has a heart , look at this innocent student !!
22 - years old and beaten to death by 6 police because of a quarrel !!!
They say they have connections , us ordinary people already understand .
The Communist Party protect them even if they beat someone to death , and even if they are punished , it will be a joke .
Everyone await for this outcome !
Just those six police safely and with no problems !
Even if we ordinary people have our arguments , we cannot express them clearly !
Did you see that ?
Beaten to death .
They will say they were temporary hires , hahaha !
So terrible , the country is what you six and your friends say it is , hahaha .
If Chairman Mao was alive , he would execute all of your families !!!
Kill even nine generations of your kin !
All speaking lies , can you sleep peacefully at night ?
Absolutely true , this group of police normally are no different from hooligans , a lot of people in the vicinity looking on all said this .
What more , it took from 10 pm last night until this morning before the Harbin public security bureau sent someone here .
I saw a person in the morning filming the scene , wondering why no one has been sent here yet , was it because it has been blocked off ?
It really makes me feel indignant .
A young life so easily ended , regret !
Poor parents , losing their son forever in a blink of an eye !
Tonight , riding the # 55 bus line and only after passing by the scene of the incident did I know something this big happened .
On the bus , I heard a passenger mention the three occupations ( teacher , doctor , police ) that people most respected 30 years ago are now the most corrupt .
Hearing this was rather profound .
I am waiting to see if television programs and these two day ’s newspapers can have news about this .
Because there are six who beat one to death ; there was one who killed six !
Comments on Mop :
I am here to see how long it will take for this topic to be harmonized [ deleted by the authorities ] .
I feel the police did not do the right thing , according to the law .
But that university student is from the Sports Academy , not much different from some minor hooligan .
I am a Harbin person , those Sports Academy students are not fit to be called university students .
One less 22 - year - old punk .
Nothing better to do than going to a nightclub to play , getting into a conflict , I bet he is not a good guy .
Though , I still dislike Northeasterners , they only know how to have damn fights .
Our school ’s Northeasterners have nothing better to do than have fights .
Brainless .
Other than bullying the common people , what else does China ’s police know how to do ?
Where is Yang Jia ?
Give them Sanlu to drink !
This student also was not a “ lamp that saves oil ” [ someone who does not cause trouble ] !
He went clubbing , went to cause trouble , the problem is not just the police !
Dog eat dog … who wins and who loses .
A university student who drives a luxury car in the middle of night to a nightclub to seduce “ MM ” is also no one good .
… weird , where is Harbin ’s version of a knife murderer …
It is true .
Right now all over Harbin people are discussing this incident .
“ They also screamed : “ Do you still know people ?
I will see who you know , there will be no problem even if I beat you to death ! ' ”
From these words , everyone can see that it was the young man who was looking for trouble at the time … and who provoked who …
But , both sides have fault .
If we are going to blame , blame the Northeasterners for their “ die but do not bend ” attitudes … the result is death …
Actually , if at the time he was not so insolent , the police would not have beaten him to death …
This matter has already become big .
Right now , Harbin students are preparing to skip class and go demonstrate !!
Yesterday , I already heard of this !
I did not think I would see pictures !~
Calling the people ’s hero , “ Yang Jia . ”
Is this China ???
No , it cannot be , I believe these things must have happened in the 20th century !!
Only in that time period ’s society could something like this happen !
We are now already a harmonious society , this is impossible !
We are now taking big honest steps towards a Communist society !!!
It does not matter who is right or wrong , looking at that mother crying , I think everyone will be moved .
Serves him right .
Who told him to open his mouth and say he knew people ?
American police all often shoot black people to death .
Endure it [ and do not open your mouth ] .
Currently , all six policemen have been detained .
UPDATE : Many new posts on BBS forums and a media from Heilongjiang have reported that the dead student , Lin Songling , started the fight with the police officers over car parking .
The six police were drunk but initially tried to avoid a fight .
However , Lin attacked the six police and threw bricks at them .
They responded after this provocation and Lin was beaten to death .
Supposedly Lin ’s behavior ( not afraid of police ) is because his family has some “ connections . ”
Many people now feel that Lin was looking for trouble and found it .
UPDATE : For the Heilongjiang television news report that include the surveillance video showing that Lin Songling , the university student , attacked the police and new Chinee netizen reactiosn to this information , please read : Harbin Student Killed By Six Police Started Fight .

Showing infinite wisdom beyond Americans , the French have banned French television programs designed for children under three - years - old .
Unfortunately , young French children are still exposed to TV programs broadcast from foreign channels on cable , such BabyFirstTV , but now those channels must warn parents of the negative developmental effects of television watching .
Such programing now issues the following warning to French parents ,
“ Watching television can slow the development of children under 3 , even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them . ”
The warning is based on a ruling by the High Audiovisual Council which states :
Television viewing hurts the development of children under 3 years old and poses a certain number of risks , encouraging passivity , slow language acquisition , over - excitedness , troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens .
Personally , my children never showed an interest in TV until they were three - years - old , and even so , they would much rather play than sit idly by in front of the tube .
I love it now that my seven - year - old calls TV “ boring ” and would much rather read a book .
I ’ve always believed that given the right environment , children know what is best for their own development .
The world should take notice of France ’s ban on television aimed at our youngest children consumers .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives defied a White House veto threat on Tuesday by voting to end a controversial pilot program that gives long - haul commercial trucks from Mexico full access to U.S. highways .
The bill , approved 395 - 18 , would reverse a decision by the Transportation Department to continue the program , which was begun last year under NAFTA , the North American Free Trade Agreement .
The Senate has yet to take action on the issue and unless Senate leaders can garner a veto - proof two - thirds vote against the program it appeared set to continue .
Still , the Mexican Embassy in Washington said it was “ deeply concerned ” about the House vote and welcomed the administration ’s intention to veto the measure .
“ Mexico has fulfilled its NAFTA obligations and expects the U.S. do the same .
Should the bill be enacted into law , the government of Mexico will consider taking all the appropriate actions , including remedies or countermeasures under the North American Free Trade Agreement , ” the embassy statement said .
Only a limited number of Mexican trucks have been granted full access because of U.S. political wrangling between congressional Democrats and the Bush administration .
Mexican trucks with U.S. - bound cargo have historically been confined to areas just over the border where they load their goods onto American trucks .
Labor unions , road safety and consumer groups have been the chief opponents to the new program .
The administration extended it in August for up to two years even though the Democratic - led Congress was moving to shut it down .
The White House , in a statement earlier in the day warning that senior advisers would recommend a veto , said U.S. and Mexican officials had “ effectively addressed ” any safety concerns .
The White House also said terminating the program would damage trade with Mexico as well as hurt U.S. trucking firms participating in the program .
A whole train of passengers ( individually brave enough ) will be looted by a few highwaymen , simply because the latter can count on one another , while each passenger fears that if he makes a movement of resistance , he will be shot before anyone else backs him up .
If we believed that the whole car - full would rise at once with us , we should each severally rise , and train - robbing would never even be attempted .
There are , then , cases where a fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming .
William James , The Will to Believe
William James , a philosopher from the American pragmatist tradition , wrote “ The Will to Believe ” in 1896 in response to another philosopher ’s claim that we should suspend belief until we have enough evidence to justify the belief .
James argued that on the important things in life , suspending belief prevents the world from becoming the way we want it to be .
In my younger days , I was very harsh on James ’ thesis .
As I ’ve matured a bit , I see that there ’s a lot of truth to it .
For instance , have you ever noticed that when you acted as if people were trustworthy and helpful , they became trustworthy and helpful ?
Were you to have acted in ways that signaled you did n’t trust them , they would ’ve change their behaviors accordingly .
Your beliefs and actions had a large role in making the state of affairs match them .
PRODUCTIVE FLOURISHING
Because people are afraid of failing and believe and act as if they will fail , they end up scripting reality to match their beliefs .
Hence the important point of learning to become comfortable with failures and mistakes is that you ’re less likely , in the end , to make the biggest mistake : to remain steady , dependable , and run -of - the mill .
Being remarkable is risky and brings its share of mistakes , but the bigger risk is to sit on the sidelines waiting for the world to give you your chance .
I ’m not at all saying that there ’s some spooky or weird force out in the world that makes the world match your intentions and actions .
What I ’m saying is that in the social but isolated world we live in , our intentions , energy , and actions change the social environment around us .
People want to be a part of something and want to be excited , but they ’re waiting for somebody else to be the catalyst for change .
Their time , they think , will come when the world is ready for them .
So they wait .
The world is ready for you today .
We want to see the best parts of you , and we want you to share the value you bring to the world .
Sure , we ’re scared to tell you that , or we ’re busy , or lost in our own worlds , but when you show up , we ’re ready for you .
It ’s the way we are .
But if you ’re waiting for proof of this before you act , you ’ll never get it .
Proof comes after you act .
So , what would you do differently if you believed that the world would stand up with you ?
How would you feel if you could n't drive faster than 80 , or could n't raise the volume on your car radio above a certain point ?
OK , maybe you would n't care so much , but your teenage son or daughter might .
Ford is going to introduce a new system , MyKey , on its upcoming 2010 cars , starting with the Ford Focus .
It will enable parents to program a key such that certain " safety features " are enabled .
Such as the above .
According to a Harris Interactive Survey conducted for Ford , MyKey appeals to parents ( no ?! ) .* 75 % like the speed - limiting feature * 72 % like the more insistent safety - belt reminder * 63 % like the audio limit featureOne has to wonder if you can get a discount on your auto insurance if your car has this MyKey system .
You can bet Ford will lobby insurance companies for it .
About 50 % of parents who said they would consider purchasing MyKey also said they would allow their children to use the family car more often if it were equipped with the technology .
Naturally teens are opposed to MyKey , with 67 % saying they did n't want it .
Once told that they might be able to drive more , the objections dropped to 36 % .
Here are some of the features outlined in Ford 's press release : * Persistent Ford Beltminder with audio mute .
Ford 's Beltminder system typically provides a six - second reminder chime every minute for five minutes .
With MyKey , the Beltminder chime continues at the regular interval and the audio system is muted until the safety belt is buckled . *
Earlier low - fuel warning .
Rather than a warning at 50 miles to empty , MyKey provides a warning at 75 miles to empty . *
If MyKey is in the ignition , features such as Park Aid and BLIS ( Blind Spot Information System ) with Cross Traffic Alert cannot be deactivated .*
Limited top speed of 80 mph * Traction control system , that limits tire spin , cannot be deactivated *
Limited audio volume to 44 percent of total volume *
A speed alert chime at 45 , 55 or 65 mphWell , we know what the answer would be if a teen was asked , but how about HH readers ?
What do you think ?
Good marketing ploy ?
Hate it ?
Like it ?
Call you again if insurance companies give a discount ?
Saturn ’s rings may be more massive than previously thought , and potentially much older , according to calculations that simulate colliding particles in Saturn ’s rings and their erosion by meteorites .
These results support the possibility that Saturn ’s rings formed billions of years ago , perhaps at the time when giant impacts excavated the great basins on the Moon .
The findings also suggest that giant exoplanets may also commonly have rings .
Dr Larry Esposito , Principal Investigator of Cassini ’s UVIS instrument , will be presenting the results at the European Planetary Science Congress in Münster on the 23rd of September .
“ Both Cassini observations and theoretical calculations can allow the rings of Saturn to be billions of years old .
This means we humans are not just lucky to see rings around Saturn .
This would lead us to expect massive rings also to surround giant planets circling other stars , ” said Dr Esposito .
Esposito ’s colleagues at the University of Colorado , Glen Stewart and Stuart Robbins , have computed the gravitational attraction and collisions between more than 100,000 particles , representing a sample of those in Saturn ’s rings .
They followed the orbit and history of each individual particle , and calculate the amount of starlight that would pass through the ring .
These results have been compared to Cassini observations of starlight blocked by the rings , which has traditionally been used to estimate the total amount of material in the ring system .
Esposito used this method in 1983 to estimate that rings of Saturn contain as much material as Saturn ’s small moon Mimas , which is about 250 miles across .
The new simulations show Saturn ’s ring particles aggregate into clumps , which would lead to the previous estimate being low by a factor of 3 or more .
Calculations by Esposito and his student Joshua Elliott show that meteorites slowly grind and shatter the particles in the ring .
Gradually , a layer of dust and fragments builds up and covers each particle .
This layer includes both ice ( from the particle ) and meteoritic dust .
As time passes , the ring system is more polluted and darkened by meteoritic dust .
Because the rings appear so clean and bright , it was argued that the rings of Saturn were much younger than Saturn , which is some 4.5 billion years old .
It was calculated from Voyager measurements that the rings are only about 100 million years old , approximately as ancient as when dinosaurs inhabited the Earth .
The new calculations show that if the rings are more massive , they appear less polluted , and thus could be proportionately older .
Recycling of ring material extends their lifetime and reduces the expected darkening .
One problem with this proposal for more massive and ancient rings is that the Pioneer 11 space mission to Saturn in 1979 measured the ring mass indirectly by observing charged particles created by cosmic rays bombarding the rings .
“ Those mass estimates were similar to the ones from Voyager star occultations , apparently confirming the previous low mass value .
However , we now recognize that the charged particles are double - valued .
That means they could arise from either a small or large mass .
We now see that the larger mass value could be consistent with the underestimates due to ring clumpiness , ” said Dr Esposito .

But Britain , which once ranked in the top five , has slipped to 44th place behind El Salvador and Peru , after a 50 billion pound ( $ 86.5 billion ) pledge this week by the government to bolster bank balance sheets .
The United States , where some of Wall Street ’s biggest financial names have collapsed in recent weeks , rated only 40 , just behind Germany at 39 , and smaller states such as Barbados , Estonia and even Namibia , in southern Africa .
The United States was on Thursday considering buying a slice of debt - laden banks to inject trust back into lending between financial institutions now too wary of one another to lend .
The World Economic Forum ’s Global Competitiveness Report based its findings on opinions of executives , and handed banks a score between 1.0 ( insolvent and possibly requiring a government bailout ) and 7.0 ( healthy , with sound balance sheets ) .
Canadian banks received 6.8 , just ahead of Sweden ( 6.7 ) , Luxembourg ( 6.7 ) , Australia ( 6.7 ) and Denmark ( 6.7 ) .
UK banks collectively scored 6.0 , narrowly behind the United States , Germany and Botswana , all with 6.1 .
France , in 19th place , scored 6.5 for soundness , while Switzerland ’s banking system scored the same in 16th place , as did Singapore ( 13th ) .
The ranking index was released as central banks in Europe , the United States , China , Canada , Sweden and Switzerland slashed interest rates in a bid to end to panic selling on markets and restore trust in the shaken banking system .
The Netherlands ( 6.7 ) , Belgium ( 6.6 ) , New Zealand ( 6.6 ) , Malta ( 6.6 ) rounded out the WEF ’s banking top 10 with Ireland , whose government unilaterally pledged last week to guarantee personal and corporate deposits at its six major banks .
Also scoring well were Chile ( 6.5 , 18th ) and Spain , South Africa , Norway , Hong Kong and Finland all ending up in the top 20 .
At the bottom of the list was Algeria in 134th place , with its banks scoring 3.9 to be just below Libya ( 4.0 ) , Lesotho ( 4.1 ) , the Kyrgyz Republic ( 4.1 ) and both Argentina and East Timor ( 4.2 ) .

World Champ Surfer Peter Drouyn Plans Sex Change
Former world surfing championhas revealed his plan to have a sex change operation , saying male hormones have been draining from his body for the past eight years .
" It has n't been intentional .
It 's totally natural , with no medication or hormone therapies , no enhancements and no advice .
It 's just happening , " Peter claims .
The 58 - year - old Australian says he has always felt like a woman trapped in a man 's body .
" I have more a woman 's emotional and physical make - up , except for one difference - I was born with a male appendage .
It 's that simple , " he said .
" My body is finally delivering the truth . "
Drouyn won numerous events through the 1960s and early ‘ 70s , and in 1977 devised the man-on man heat system where just two surfers compete in each heat ( where before four or even six was normal ) .
The man - on - man system is still used in ASP World Tour contests today .

The Bush Administration can be rightfully criticized for a lot of things , but they 've just gotten something right .
Earlier this week , Congress passed a new bill called the " Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act " .
The measure essentially asks the Justice Department to bring lawsuits against copyright infringers and downloading pirates so that the music and movie industries would n't have to do it themselves anymore .
Basically , the legislation would be a gift to those industries , shifting the financial burden onto taxpayers to protect Hollywood 's and the RIAA 's outdated business models .
The bill also calls for the creation of a " copyright czar " - a Cabinet - level position " charged with implementing a nationwide plan to combat piracy and report directly to the president and Congress regarding domestic international intellectual property enforcement programs .
" But give credit where credit is due .
The Bush Administration has pushed back against both of these efforts .
First , it negotiated with the Senate to remove any language that dumps the enforcement burden on the Justice Department .
And now , even with the bill 's passage in Congress , the White House is threatening to veto the " copyright czar " provisions .
Due to online file sharing , copyright law certainly needs to be reformed , but it ought to be done in an honest intellectual manner that maintains the goal of protecting artists and content creators while still not stripping consumers of established rights they have had for decades .
The bill that Congress has brought to the President 's desk hardly meets that criteria .
It is hard to justify calling it anything other than a multibillion - dollar gift to the recording industries that is a direct result of ambitious corporate lobbying , and comes at the taxpayer expense .
With the War on Terror , the War on Drugs , the Financial Bailout , etc. , do we really need the government to engage in an all - out War on Piracy ?
Are n't there more important things for Congress to be focusing on this week ?
Review : Quikrete Epoxy Garage Floor Coating
Well , this is one of those reviews , like many others , that is a bit of a double - edged sword .
A couple of months ago , while we still had a little sunshine up here in the Pacific Northwest , I set about to coat my garage floor with epoxy .
It ’s important to do this job while the sun is shining so that you can have your stuff outside for a few days .
Make no mistake , unless your garage is barren , you ’re going to have to keep a few things outdoors while your flooring cures .
So , I got all set up .
Tool bench outside .
Bikes and other sporting equipment outside .
Everyone is well aware that there will be no cars parked indoors till Tuesday .
I went to the hardware store to pick up a couple of cases of Quikrete ’s Epoxy Garage Floor Coating based on relatively strong reviews from friends , both online and real .
And , having used epoxy quite a few times in the past , I was pretty familiar with how things should work .
I ’ve always found that the devil is in the details with epoxy work , and that one of the most important things you can do is proper prep work before hand .
In this case , that meant giving the garage floor a good cleaning .
It almost felt unnatural given how I ’ve abused that poor floor in the past .
Anyway , floor swept and even mopped .
Oil and grease stains removed and I ’ve ready to go .
Honestly , following the directions was n’t terribly difficult .
Mixing was a breeze , and application was relatively painless .
Just knowing that patience is the greatest virtue when applying epoxy is the biggest obstacle .
It took a few projects to figure that out , but it ’s made all the difference for me over the years .
Back to the directions – they were a snap .
Let ’s get to the meat and potatoes here .
Why the double - edged sword ?
Well , I took my time to properly prepare for the project , and followed Quikrete ’s instructions to a tee .
And it came out beautifully .
So , what ’s the rub ?
The rub is that the product itself is really quite nice , but there is n’t enough of it .
I know how to calculate square feet , and I was well within their recommended usage statistics .
In the end , I ended up heading back to the hardware store a couple of days later to buy two more Quikrete Epoxy Garage Floor Coating kits , doubling my initial cost estimates for the project .
All in all though , I think the end result came out better by letting the first coat cure and then applying the second .
So , the verdict ?
Great product , just expect to buy more than you think you ’ll need .
Using an Epoxy Sealer
Over the next few weeks , I ’m going to try to become more active on the blog , and plow through a bunch of post ideas that have been brought up to me , or that have occurred to me .
Today , we ’ll tackle epoxy sealers , how to pick a good one , and what to be aware of going into any project involving them .
For years , I have done the standard Thompson ’s treatment on my various decks and patios in the homes I have lived in .
It should come as not surprise , though , given the nature of this blog , that I have been itching to try something a little more robust , a little more … epoxy - like .
So , naturally , I began my latest outdoor wood treatment project by seeing if there were any heavy duty epoxy products that I might try for my deck .
Drawback # 1 : epoxy sealer is not cheap .
Accustomed to the bang - for - your - buck deck sealants that I ’ve always used in the past , I encountered a bit of sticker shock as I began shopping .
But , hey , I love using epoxy products , and have found that they always pay for themselves over time , so this should n’t be any different , right ?
Well , I got over my aversion to spending additional money pretty quickly , and got down to business .
I found a few different products from Bels - Smith , Gluvit , Marine Tex , and System Three .
I ’ve developed a bit of a bias over the years for System Three , and even though they specify marine use for their sealer , I figured it would probably work just fine on my deck .
In fact , this is one of the reasons that I like their products so much .
They seem to engineer everything to stand up to the ocean , and my home is a much friendlier environment , so my projects are always overdone , and I like that .
Anyway , I went with their S - 1 Epoxy Sealer , and have been very pleased with the results .
Not only is my deck tough as nails now , I was able to mix in a white pigment into the sealer and give my deck a little color .
Plus the pigment should give my epoxy a little extra UV protection – always nice when you ’re dealing with epoxy as it ’s the only weakness you might ever encounter .
Application was a piece of cake as I ’ve become pretty darn good at using epoxy products over the years .
The only thing I ’d recommend , even though they suggest minimal surface prep , would be to give your deck a pretty thorough scrubdown prior to using the sealant .
It ’ll only make your life easier in the end .
I try to be positive and encouraging in my blog , rather than negative and pessimistic .
However , there are a few things that simply bother the heck out of me .
One such thing is the Marvel Comics superhero named “ The Sentry “ , the golden guardian of good with the power of one million exploding suns .
Goodness gracious , why ca n’t this character die or simply fade away into obscurity ?
The Sentry was introduced in the year 2000 and is essentially the Superman equivalent in the Marvel Universe .
I ’m not going to cover his whole background here ; you can read all of that over at Wikipedia .
The primary difference between Superman and the Sentry is that Superman has his act together .
The Sentry is a psychological wreck .
In general , I think that ’s an interesting concept – What if Superman came to Earth but suffered from mental breakdowns ?
There are some fascinating stories that could come out of that idea with some really dense plots .
However , the writing for the Sentry character so far has been so lackluster that most fans simply are waiting for him to go away .
I never got to read the first Sentry mini-series , but I ’ve heard it was decent .
In the mini-series it ’s revealed that the Sentry was one of the premier heroes of the Marvel Universe back in the day ( along with the FF , the X - Men , Spider - Man , etc ) .
Due to a series of circumstances , the memories of everyone in the world were altered to forget about the Sentry .
So when he returned in 2000 , it was quite confusing for him and the others that began to remember him .
That ’s actually an interesting plot .
It seems very feasible to me that one of the kooky 1960 ’s stories featured planet - wide memory alteration .
In fact , it was such an interesting concept that DC Comics did almost the exact same thing back in 1994 with a JLA character named Triumph ( six years before the first appearance of the Sentry ) .
Considering how crappy Triumph turned out , you ’d think Marvel would n’t have bothered to steal the idea .
After the first mini-series , the Sentry joined Brian Michael Bendis ’ “ New Avengers “ .
As one of the most powerful individuals on the planet and a member of the foremost superteam , the Sentry managed to do just about nothing over the course of a couple years .
Then came the second Sentry mini-series , which was one of the most painful comics to read …
EVER .
It was really , really bad .
Next , for no apparent reason , the Sentry joined Brian Michael Bendis ’ “ Mighty Avengers ” and has continued to contribute very little .
And finally , Marvel has recently started a new mini-series entitled , “ The Age of the Sentry “ .
While the new mini-series has a new writer and a retro feel to it ( see picture right ) , I just ca n’t bring myself to read another Sentry comic .
I ’m voting with my dollars on this one and I hope many other fans will do the same .
While the Sentry could have been the deciding factor and resolved many Marvel Universe stories ( such as “ Civil War ” , “ World War Hulk ” , and “ Secret Invasion ” ) , he seems incapable of setting his mind to anything during times of extreme stress .
When he does finally commit to being involved in these world - threatening events , he ultimately contributes very little .
Personally , I think this is a writer ’s crutch so that the Sentry does n’t just sweep in and fix any problems the writer has created for the heroes .
At first I could buy into the fact that the Sentry did n’t get involved for whatever reason of the day .
Now that it ’s happened a few times , I think it ’s just ridiculous .
The Sentry could actually be a cool character , but time and again he ’s been reduced to a coward or an indecisive flake .
The Sentry also has some subplots that could be interesting … the operative word being “ could ” .
These subplots include : his mechanical assistant CLOC , his repetitively - resurrected wife , and The Void ( Sentry ’s dark half / alter - ego ) .
Again , less - than - stellar writing has made these subplots more bothersome than fascinating .
Brian Michael Bendis seems keen on including the Sentry in his Avengers titles , so I gotta think he has a plan for the character .
Since the “ New Avengers ” title began back in 2004 , the Sentry has pretty much been surplus to requirements .
So maybe Bendis is planning to shock the readers with some big revelation or action regarding the Sentry .
For example , maybe the Sentry ’s destiny is connected with the “ Secret Invasion ” storyline .
When Bendis started the “ New Avengers ” title he had already begun to map out what would eventually become “ Secret Invasion ” .
Perhaps one of the reasons Bendis has continued to carry the Sentry character is that he ’s integral to the “ Secret Invasion ” series .
Who knows ?
One can dream and hope .
Would n’t it be nice if the Sentry was simply a Skrull or died in the penultimate battle with the Skrulls ?
That would be many kinds of awesome .
Now it ’s fair to say that I ’m about a month behind on reading my comics .
So if Sentry has done something interesting in that time , I ’ve missed out .
However , my Sentry - Sense has n’t been tingling , so I seriously doubt they found anything worthwhile for him to do other than cry in the corner .
If I had my druthers , Marvel Comics would either kill the Sentry or simply make him go away .
Considering how little he ’s added to the Marvel Universe , why does he continue to hang around ?
Ca n’t he indecisively meander off to the Avengers Has - Been Home ?
He could play checkers with Silverclaw and shuffleboard with D - Man .
Would n’t that be nice for his golden years ?
( pun intended )
I ’m not the only one who feels such frustration about this character .
The folks over at Old - Wizard.com did a great piece on him in August entitled , “ Worst Character Ever ? ”
The guys at iFanboy did an article in June entitled , “ The Sentry Problem : Void Where Prohibited “ .
Both are definitely worth a read .
And finally , I wish the owner of the URL http://www.killthesentry.com/ would get that site up and running .
I ’d be a big supporter .

September 26 , 2008 -- " Rich people got it good in this country " , said African - American comedian Wanda Sykes on the September 24 Tonight Show with Jay Leno .
" We refuse to let them not be rich .
Think about it .
Broke people are about to bailout rich people .
This is what is going on . "
" And they want no oversight .
$ 700 billion dollars and no oversight !
No oversight ?
Why should we ?
I want receipts dammit !
What do you mean no oversight ?
Because , oh , you 're so good with the other money ? "
" This is the biggest piece of garbage ever .
You know what ?
It 's welfare for the rich ...
" It 's going to cost every taxpayer $ 7000 .
You got the guy there busting his gut working two jobs and barely making $ 12,000 a year and he's got to cough up something so some Wall Street guy can keep his swimming pool .
Man , that 's garbage ! "

' Historic swindle '
Sykes pre-empted US President George W. Bush 's television address to the nation later that night where he demanded that Congress pass the US $ 700 billion bailout or else face " a long and painful recession " .
Bush summonsed presidential contenders Barack Obama and John McCain to attend an emergency briefing in the White House .
The pressure is on Congress to endorse the bailout but the politicians report a groundswell of opposition from their constituents to the bailout .
And no wonder .
A million people have lost their homes in the US over the last two years and real wages have fallen while corporate profits have soared .
The richest 1 % of the US population received their highest share of the nation 's income in at least two decades while their average tax rate fell to the lowest level in eighteen years or more ( Wall Street Journal , July 23 , 2008 ) .
As progressive US writer Rick Wolf explained in MR - zine :
" Real wages stopped rising in the US in the 1970s , yet the American psyche and self - image , subject to relentless advertising , was committed to rising consumption .
To enable that , workers with flat wages had to borrow to afford rising consumption .
For the last 30 years loans replaced wages , but rising consumer debt introduces new risks and dangers .
If , simultaneously , politicians use state borrowing to avoid taxing the rich while providing vast corporate subsidies and waging endless wars , the debt problems mushroom .
Aggressive , deregulated financial companies grabbed the resulting `market opportunity ' by devising ever more complex , hidden , and dangerously risky ways to profit hugely from the social debt bubble .
" A sub - prime economy produced sub - prime wages , sub - prime borrowers , sub - prime lenders and sub - prime government regulation ... "
From the point of view of the great majority , a corporate elite that has ruthlessly enriched itself at the working majority 's expense now , having tripped themselves up through an orgy of speculation in deregulated financial markets , comes begging to the public for a $ 700 billion bail out .
Actually its more than twice that .
In the last year , Wall Street has already received some $ 900 billion worth of bailouts .
So what we are looking at is more than a billion and half dollars of corporate bailout .
And who is to say it will stop there ?
Conservative estimates of the amount of bad debt still in the US financial system are $ 1 - 2 trillion .
But it could be more .
No one knows and the banks are n't opening their books so the public can find out .
The Bush administration 's bailout proposal is basically for the public to keep buying bad debt off these banks at inflated prices , and demanding little in return .
William Greider wrote in the US Nation ( September 19 ) : " If Wall Street gets away with this , it will represent an historic swindle of the American public -- all sugar for the villains , lasting pain and damage for the victims . "
Chain - ganged to US economy
If the US public feels blackmailed and swindled , they are not alone .
Walden Bello , writing in the September 24 Manila Nation , noted growing trepidation in the Third World , where the current Wall Street crisis looks like " a replay , though on a much larger scale , of the 1997 Asian financial crisis , which brought down the red - hot ' tiger economies ' of the East " .
" The shocking absence of Wall Street regulation brings back awful memories of the elimination of capital controls by East Asian governments , which were under pressure from the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury Department .
That move triggered a tsunami of speculative capital onto Asian markets that sharply receded after sky - high land and stock prices came tumbling down .
" Treasury Secretary Paulson 's proposed massive bailout of Wall Street 's tarnished titans reminds people here of the billions the IMF hustled up after ' 97 in the name of assisting them - - money that was used instead to rescue foreign investors . "
Bello added : " Trillions of dollars of Asian public and private money are invested in US firms and property , with the five biggest Asian holders accounting for over half of all foreign investment in US government debt instruments .
Funds from Asia have become a key prop of US government spending and the middle - class consumption that have become the driver of the American economy .
With so much of Asia 's wealth relying on the stability of the US economy , there is not likely to be any precipitate move to abandon Wall Street securities and US Treasury bills ...
" There is , moreover , resignation throughout Asia about the inevitability of a deep US recession and its likely massive impact on the East : the United States is China 's top export destination , while China imports raw materials and intermediate goods from Japan , Korea and Southeast Asia to shape into the products it sends to the United States .
Despite some talk a few months ago about the possibility that the economic fate of Asia could be `decoupled ' from that of the United States , most observers now see these economies as members of a chain gang shackled to one another , at least in the short and medium term . "
Trillions could be spent on real needs
The hundreds of billions being wasted on this string of corporate bailouts already overtakes the at least $ 750 billion the US has spent on the wars of occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan .
And soon it could match the $ 3 trillion spent globally on the arms .
In his September 24 address to the 63rd session of the United Nations General Assembly , Jose Ramon Machado , Cuba 's vice - president , spelled out a program of alternative use for such large amounts of money .
" While a trillion of dollars is spent on weapons in the world , more than 850 million human beings are starving , 1.1 billion people do n't have access to drinking water , 2.6 billion lack sewage services and more than 800 million are illiterate .
" More than 640 million children lack adequate housing , 115 million do not attend primary school and 10 million die before the age of five , in most cases as the result of diseases that can be cured . "
Machado added : " The formula is not difficult nor does it require great sacrifices .
All we need is the necessary political will , less egotism and the objective understanding that if we do not act today , the consequences could be apocalyptic and would affect the rich and poor alike .
For this reason , Cuba once again calls on the governments of the developed countries , on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned countries , to honour their commitments and , in particular , Cuba urges them to :
Put an end to the wars of occupation and to the plunder of the resources of the Third World countries and to free up at least a part of their millions in military spending to direct those resources towards international assistance for the benefit of sustainable development .
Cancel the foreign debt of developing countries since it has been already paid more than once , and with this , additional resources would be released that could be channeled to economic development and social programs .
Honour the commitment of directing at least 0.7 % of the gross domestic product for Official Development Assistance , unconditionally , so that the South countries would be able to use those resources for their national priorities and promote access of poor countries to substantial sums of fresh financing .
Direct one - fourth of the money that is squandered each year on commercial advertising to food production ; this would free up almost 250 billion additional dollars to fight hunger and malnutrition .
Direct the money being used for the North 's agricultural subsidies to agricultural development in the South .
By doing this , our countries would have about a billion dollars per day available to invest in food production .
Comply with the Kyoto Protocol commitments and set commitments to reduce [ greenhouse gas ] emissions more generously starting in 2012 , without wanting to increase restrictions for countries that , even today , maintain per capita emission levels that are much lower than those of the North countries .
Promote the access of the Third World to technologies and support the training of their human resources .
Today , in contrast , qualified personnel from the South are subjected to unfair competition and incentives presented by discriminatory and selective migratory policies applied by the United States and Europe .
And something that is today more urgent than ever , the establishment of a democratic and equitable international order , and a fair and transparent trading system where all states will participate , in sovereignty , in the decisions that affect them . "
Back in the land of neo-liberal bull
Wanda
Sykes is n't the only person who has noticed that the battery on her bullshit meter has been run flat in recent weeks .
She 's voiced the outraged sentiment of the great majority in the US and probably around the world .
When US President Bush made his September 24 television speech to sell the biggest corporate bailout plan since the Great Depression , their batteries went well and truly flat .
" I'm a strong believer in free enterprise , so my natural instinct is to oppose government intervention " , affirmed Bush to a incredulous audience .
" I believe companies that make bad decisions should be allowed to go out of business . "
Then came the big " BUT " .
" Under normal circumstances , I would have followed this course .
But these are not normal circumstances .
The market is not functioning properly .
There has been a widespread loss of confidence , and major sectors of America 's financial system are at risk of shutting down .
" The government 's top economic experts warn that , without immediate action by Congress , America could slip into a financial panic and a distressing scenario would unfold . "
But the multibillion dollar socialisation of corporate losses is not a break from " normal " capitalist practice but an essential feature of 21st century capitalism .
Despite all the right - wing , neoliberal , ideological blabbering about reducing government intervention , in the home of " free - market " capitalism , state spending as proportion of gross domestic product ( GDP ) has increased from 8.6 % in 1937 to an average of 20 % over the last decade .
Taxes as a proportion of GDP have also increased .
Modern capitalism totally depends on being propped up by public funds – and not only when it goes into crisis .
Think of the corporate take from the trillion of dollars of public expenditure on arms , roads and other infrastructure .
Think of the fat subsidies for private health insurance companies and for agribusiness .
The " free market " talk disguises the fact that the public purse has been spent on tax cuts for the corporate rich and on corporate welfare , bailouts being only a part of this .
Right - wing myths about how the economy supposedly thrives on individual effort and individual reward belie the actual history of the capitalist system .
In the first instance , capitalism developed only through the greatest socialisation of human labour .
Almost everything that is sold for profit today is the product of manual and intellectual collaboration beween large numbers of workers .
Without this fundamental process of socialisation there would not be a single capitalist corporation today .
Today , the giant corporations even depend on a sort of tax on wages even to get together the huge amounts of capital they need to take over other corporations and become even more gigantic .
They use our superannuation [ pension ] funds for this as well as for the sort of mind - blowing speculation that is now wiping out a large share of these funds .
You thought it was your money , but they always saw it as theirs to play with to amass more ill - gotten gains .
The rational thing would be to put an end to this nightmare born of greed .
If the public has to socialise the losses of the banks than it should socialise its profits and put the trillions to addressing urgent social and environmental needs .
This is n't just a nice idea , it is what is needed for human survival .

The town of Rock Port , in Missouri , is another of the growing number of towns and cities laying claim to be powered entirely by a renewable energy .
And though the small town only boasts a population of 1,300 , it is the first community in the United States to be powered entirely by wind power .
“ That ’s something to be very proud of , especially in a rural area like this – that we ’re doing our part for the environment , ” said Jim Crawford , a natural resource engineer at the University of Missouri Extension in Columbia .
The four turbines which are powering little Rock Port are part of a greater batch of 75 turbines , which installed across three counties , are used to harvest the plentiful wind scouring the landscape .
“ We ’re farming the wind , which is something that we have up here , ” Crawford said .
“ The payback on a per- acre basis is generally quite good when compared to a lot of other crops , and it ’s as simple as getting a cup of coffee and watching the blades spin . ”
Another benefit for the community is the tax that the wind energy developer that built the turbines must pay .
Wind Capital Group , based out of St. Louis , has to pay more than $ 1.1 million a year in country real estate taxes .
“ This is a unique situation because in rural areas it is quite uncommon to have this increase in taxation revenues , ” said Jerry Baker , and MU Extension community development specialist .
An additional bonus is that landowners can lease part of their property to wind turbines , reaping further profits from the renewable energy source .
Add on top of that the savings to rural electric companies , and at least 20 years worth of electric service ( the turbines lifespan ) , and all up , Rock Port Missouri has hit gold – so to speak .

In her acceptance speech Sarah Palin said :
We grow good people in our small towns , with honesty and sincerity and dignity
attributed to a “ writer ” .
The “ writer ” was Westbrook Pegler .
Robert F.Kennedy Jr. tells us what kind of good people Pegler had in mind :
Fascist writer Westbrook Pegler , an avowed racist who Sarah Palin approvingly quoted in her acceptance speech for the moral superiority of small town values , expressed his fervent hope about my father , Robert F. Kennedy , as he contemplated his own run for the presidency in 1965 , that “ some white patriot of the Southern tier will spatter his spoonful of brains in pubic premises before the snow flies . ”

Bravo Sheila Kennedy , bravo .
You might just save us from our gadget - obsessed selves if the Soft House you 've designed can pump the 16,000 watt - hours you predict .
The design features thin photovoltaic films woven into semi-transparent curtains .
The idea is similar to the solar power ski-suits ( seriously ) we 've seen .
Unfortunately , a home fitted entirely in solar textiles is still too costly at the moment .
Cost measured in cash , apparently .
The pain is debilitating .
The only option : smoking medical marijuana .
That 's the reality for many hepatitis C patients whose road to health includes a liver transplant .
Although Canadian transplant centres are more willing than those in the United States , not everyone says yes to liver patients who smoke marijuana , and a University of Alberta researcher says that decision - making process is unacceptable .
Karen Kroeker , along with three other students at various universities , sent out surveys to a number of transplant clinics across the United States and Canada .
Results found that the difference between the two countries were obvious in some patient groups : around 60 per cent of Canadian centres would either do the surgery or consider it for a liver transplant patient who smoked marijuana , while 70 per cent of U.S. transplant programs said absolutely not .
Kroeker also found that patients in both countries , who have no social support — meaning they have no family , friends or a social worker — are n't likely to receive the organ they need .
The problem Kroeker has with these results : the lack of literature to support the surgeons ' decision .
As a result of her findings , which will be published in the November issue of Liver International , Kroeker says physicians need to determine eligibility criteria for liver - transplant patients that pertains directly to the likelihood of a patient rejecting the organ and is based only on empirical medical evidence .
When a patient is being reviewed for eligibility , whether they smoke marijuana should n't be a factor , she says .
" If we have evidence to say the patients do n't do well , then I think that 's a reason to exclude people , " Kroeker said .
She cites alcohol use as an example .
When transplants first began to be performed , those who drank alcohol were n't eligible for a new liver .
Kroeker 's study found , however , that surgeons conducted studies on the topic of abstinence and liver health and , as a result of that research , transplant rules changed .
If the patient has been sober for six months , 94 per cent of the clinics in North America will now consider transplantation .
The same goes for HIV - positive patients .
" When they first started transplanting , HIV was an absolute contraindication .
No one even considered transplantation because the disease was a death sentence at that time . "
Kroeker adds that 's no longer the case and that there is research being conducted on post - transplant HIV - patients that will help determine the viability of transplants in HIV - positive patients .
In reference to her findings , Kroeker said , " I think there should be a large - scale study , " because too - little research is available on post - transplant patients whose eligibility may currently be in question .
" Unless you actually perform transplants for those people , how would you know how they do ? "
Target to pay $ 1.7 million for overcharging customers at registers

Target stores has agreed to pay a $ 1.7 million civil penalty for overcharging California customers through electronic cash register scanners that rang up too - high prices , the Sonoma County district attorney 's office said today .
The stores , without admitting guilt , also agreed to improve their pricing procedures for the next four years .
The case arose after weights and measures inspectors in Sonoma , Contra Costa , Marin , Santa Cruz and Fresno counties found " numerous occasions where the price charged at the cash register was not the lowest posted price , " according to a statement from the Sonoma County district attorney 's office .
" Customers should not have to worry about being charged the correct price , " said District Attorney Stephan Passalacqua .
" We believe the settlement sends a message . "
Who can fault him for trying ?
He 's Joe the Plumber , not Joe the foreign policy adviser .
He gave it his best shot yesterday .
And some would say his initial outing in answering foreign policy questions was better than Sarah Palin 's inaugural attempt .
How'd this happen ?
How did Joe the Plumber begin dispensing foreign policy advice ?
Simple .
There was a " Joe the Plumber " bus tour yesterday in Ohio .
Joe the Plumber ( aka Joe Wurzelbacher ) teamed up with Congressman Rob Portman ( who was allegedly on McCain 's VP short list ) and they went to five different towns in Ohio stumping for the Republican nominee .
Wurzelbacher was doing everything you do on the campaign trail .
You know , shaking hands , talking to people , kissing babies , taking pictures , saying a vote for Barack Obama dooms Israel ...
WHAT ?
On the first leg of the five - town " Joe the Plumber World Invasion " tour , Wurzelbacher ran into a supporter who asked Joe if he believed , " a vote for Barack Obama means death to Israel . "
Wurzelbacher does n't have handlers .
Many would say , especially Palin supporters , that gives him an advantage .
So instead of practicing the age - old political maneuver of not answering the question , but answering what you want to talk about -- he replied to it .
" I 'll go ahead and agree with you on that , " he said .
Joe makes news
This of course made news .
Wurzelbacher is n't an official spokesman for the McCain campaign , but in stumping for McCain he 's kind of one .
And " a vote for Obama means death to Israel " is not a McCain talking point ( we checked on his web site ) .
Joe on FOX
Shepherd Smith over at Fox News had Wurzelbacher on the air after he made the ominous comment .
A very clumsy exchange ensued with Wurzelbacher seeming to be stumped with his own statement , putting up , at one point , the equivalent of a white flag .
" Listen , you do n’t want my opinion on foreign policy .
I know just enough probably to be dangerous , " he said .
" Yeah , well that ’s what I was kinda wondering , " Smith replied .
What say Joe ?
Where was Wurzelbacher going ?
He was just articulating ( poorly ) a McCain position that Barack Obama is too inexperienced to become President .
McCain often says that Obama 's statement that he would meet with even rogue leaders without precondition is testament to his naivete .
McCain versus Obama
There is a continuous volley between the candidates on this issue .
Like in the first debate :
McCain : Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad , Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition .
Without precondition .
Here is Ahmadinejad , who is now in New York , talking about the extermination of the State of Israel , of wiping Israel off the map , and we 're going to sit down , without precondition , across the table , to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel , and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying , they 've probably been doing the right thing , because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior .
Obama : Now , understand what this means " without preconditions . "
It does n't mean that you invite them over for tea one day .
What it means is that we do n't do what we 've been doing , which is to say , " Until you agree to do exactly what we say , we wo n't have direct contacts with you . "
There 's a difference between preconditions and preparation .
Of course we 've got to do preparations , starting with low - level diplomatic talks , and it may not work , because Iran is a rogue regime .
Some backing
So Wurzelbacher gave it a shot .
It 's not easy to ad - lib about foreign policy on the campaign trail .
The McCain team even backed him up a bit by emailing a supportive statement to Fox News :
" While he ’s clearly his own man , so far Joe has offered some penetrating and clear analysis that cuts to the core of many of the concerns that people have with Barack Obama ’s statements and policies .
Whether its Obama 's willingness to sit down unconditionally with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , or his plans to redistribute the paychecks of hardworking Americans , there is good reason to question the judgment that Obama would bring to the Oval Office . "
So , there you go , Joe .
While not Colin Powell or Warren Christopher , Wurzelbacher survived the day on the campaign trail .
And although he will probably not answer questions on foreign policy in future stops , give him credit for trying .
Hannibal Gaddafi was briefly arrested in Geneva in July
Libya is to withdraw assets from Swiss banks , estimated at $ 7bn , as a diplomatic row over the arrest of the Libyan leader 's youngest son escalates .
Hannibal Gaddafi and his wife were detained in Geneva for assault in July , but the charges were later dropped .
The state - run news agency Jana also said that Libya was halting oil shipments to Switzerland .
An unnamed foreign ministry official said it was for the " poor treatment of Libyan diplomats and businessmen " .
All kinds of economic co-operation with Switzerland are to be stopped until Geneva clarifies its motives , Jana quotes him as saying .
Compensation
The BBC's Rana Jawad in the Libyan capital , Tripoli , says Libya had previously demanded an apology from Swiss authorities for the arrest of Muammar Gaddafi 's son .
Tamoil says it supplies 20 % of the Swiss fuel market
The couple were accused of hitting two of their staff .
They were released on bail three days later and Libya did not follow through on a threat at the time to halt oil shipments .
The two servants dropped all charges after receiving undisclosed compensation .
Libyan oil firm Tamoil says it supplies 20 % of the Swiss fuel market and has more than 300 petrol stations in the country .
Swiss authorities have made no immediate comment on the latest developments .

While turbochargers had been used in an assortment of racecars prior to the 1970s , it was the 1977 - 1988 Formula
One turbo era that brought an intense burst of development .
With the involvement of major car companies - most notably Honda , Renault and BMW - the sudden increase in R&D that went into turbocharging was monumental .
Today - twenty years on - we 've seen turbochargers accepted into mainstream mass - produced performance vehicles and those golden years of F1 turbocharging are remembered as something of an ' automotive fairytale ' .
In Part One of The Early Days of Turbocharging we 'll take a look at these awesome machines that pushed contemporary design ...
The First Appearance
From the late 1960s through much of the 1970s , almost every Formula One team used Ford 's venerable Cosworth DFV V8 engine - it was the engine to have .
These 3.0 - litre V8 race engines breathed through 4 - valve heads and employed mechanical fuel injection , slide - type throttles and - thanks to the fitment of CDI - could rev up to 13,000 rpm .
Ferrari also campaigned a highly complex flat - 12 engine at the time , with both engines reputedly making in the vicinity of 525 horsepower .
Coinciding with this era , aerodynamic ' ground effects ' had enabled extraordinary amounts of downforce with a minimal drag trade - off .
In 1977 , Renault was the first team along pit lane to experiment with a new breed of smaller capacity turbocharged engines .
This gallant move was motivated by the company 's foreseen image boost , technical spin-off and employee inspiration .
Following the guidelines set by the governing body , Renault designed a turbo engine that could rival the all - dominating Cosworth 3.0 - litre V8 .
Note that the maximum allowable swept capacity of a force - inducted engine had to bethat of a naturally aspirated engine - hence Renault 's turbo engine , and all that followed , displaced a maximum of 1.5 - litres .
Although the apparent weight advantage of the smaller engine seems attractive , it was found that - by the time the significant mass of the turbo system was added - there was no weight advantage at all .
In fact , given the extra aerodynamic drag of the necessary intercooler (s ) , the package started off at a .
However , all of this became irrelevant when the immense potential for power was discovered .
In their initial appearances , turbo engines were most noted for impressive performance on high - altitude racetracks .
In these situations , teams could make up for the reduced air pressure found at higher altitude by simply adding more boost .
Still - with a maximum power similar to that attained with the naturally aspirated 3.0 - litre DFVs - this was only the start ...
In 1979 - just two years after their brave debut - Renault had won its first Grand Prix with a turbocharged engine .
And that 's when the rest of the field started to take notice - in fact , the majority of teams had proceeded to jump onto the turbo bandwagon by 1983 .
There were many engine configurations employed in a number of different chassis .
To name just a few , Renault stuck with its DOHC , 24 - valve 90 - degree V6 ( which went on to receive twin - turbos and a water - to - air intercooler at one stage ) , the twin - turbo Porsche / TAG engine used a 80 - degree V6 platform and both Cosworth - Ford and Ferrari adopted a twin - turbo V6 block set at 120 - degrees .
Curiously , BMW adopted a single turbo , DOHC 16 - valve , in - line four - cylinder ( which was based on an already - aging engine design ) , while Zakspeed also competed with a single turbo in - line four - cylinder .
Alfa Romeo even made a showing with a 90 - degree V8 engine hung with twin -turbos .
These first turbo engines were quite crude in many ways ; they used a diesel engine based turbocharger , their static compression ratio was extremely low ( around 6.5:1 ) and there were problems delivering the necessary fuel injection and ignition timing .
This meant that bulk - rich mixtures and conservative timing had to be adopted to ensure a vehicle could finish a race .
A technological step backward was also taken in regard to intake throttles - the turbo engines reverted to conventional butterfly throttles due to concerns that the movement of slide throttles might be affected by boost pressure .
Note that the early 1.5 - litre turbo engines also had a lower redline than the 3.0 - litre naturally aspired engines - between 10,500 and 12,000 rpm was the redline for the entire field of turbo engines .
This later increased to around 13,000 rpm .
Boost pressure was quite low during these early years .
Engines were boosted up to a relatively modest 2.5 Bar ( absolute pressure ) and there was great focus given to intercooling ; it is said that charge - air temps were dragged down from 240 to 40 degrees Celsius post - intercooler .
Such a configuration was good for around 650 hp at the flywheel - BMW , for example , claimed 640 hp for their 1983 Driver 's Championship winning engine .
Obviously , the turbo engines were now making a lot more power than the naturally aspired 3.0 - litre F1 engines , but there were many concerns other than from outright power .
Turbo lag , low - rpm torque and drivability were truly appalling and , as a result , the turbo cars were consistently slower around tight racetracks .
Pushing the Limits
As fuel injection and turbo technology progressed at an incredible rate during the early ' 80s , teams were able to - relatively safely - push boost higher and higher .
Of course , there were a few engine and turbocharger failures along the way , which often led to spectacular fires ... Increases to 3.5
Bar boost became common for each team , giving rise to well over 700 hp at the flywheel - nearly a third more power than the competing atmo DFV V8 .
Perhaps more importantly , the new developments made the engine more progressive and , therefore , easier to drive .
Lag and low - rpm torque had been massively improved ( partly thanks to the introduction of ball - bearing ceramic turbochargers ) and Ferrari , albeit briefly , had also developed what we now label an anti-lag system , whereby a fuel / air mix was ignited in the exhaust manifolds .
Ground effect aerodynamics - which had absolutely transformed the sport during the ' 70s - was officially banned in 1983 , resulting in a halving of downforce .
This meant teams had to go back to fitting massive wings , which - although restoring some of the lost downforce - came with a major drag penalty .
This happened to play nicely into the hands of the turbo cars , which could generate the immense power necessary to haul the high drag wings through the air .
A drag co-efficient of 1.5 ( more than three times worse than the average family sedan ) had become common ' overnight ' .
Late 1983 also saw the first teams using so - called ' jungle juice ' .
This heady mix of chemicals - which was just allowed under the governing body 's loose terminology of ' fuel ' - gave tremendous resistance to detonation and allowed boost pressure to soar .
The BMW - Brabham , for example , was boosted to 4.5 Bar ( absolute pressure , remember ) for qualifying and output swelled to over 1000 hp .
For races , however , boost was reduced to give ' only ' around 750 hp - reliability was the name of the game .
Drivability was also further improved , since the new jungle juice allowed a much higher static compression ratio ( anywhere up to 9.4:1 ) .
Meanwhile , Off the Field ...
The Formula
One turbo era was as much about manufacturer marketing as wining championships .
With the public witnessing the advantages of turbo technology - in a wonderfully spectacular fashion - the consumer market received a sudden influx of production turbo cars .
During the early ' 80s , vehicles such as Honda 's City Turbo , Renault 's Uno Turbo , BMW 's 7 - series turbo and , of course , Porsche 's legendary turbos enjoyed terrific sales success - and paved the path for every turbocar to date .
The next year was a continuation of the same theme .
With more work on fuel grade and the introduction of fully electronic management systems , teams could boost their engines even further .
Renault decided not to use any wastegates for the Australian GP , for example ...
As a result , qualifying manifold pressure rose to over 5.0 Bar ( up to 5.5 Bar has been reported ) and outputs were generously in excess of 1100 hp - some sources say approximately 1300 hp .
It came as no surprise , therefore , when Gerhard Berger 's Ferrari V6 twin - turbo was clocked at a milestone 218 mph ( 351 km / h ) .
And , remember , we are still talking about little 1.5 - litre engines ...
Of course there were a number of trade - offs that had to be made .
The increased charge - air temperatures associated with such boost called for elaborate intercooler water spray systems , which poured out around 3 - litres per lap .
More horrendous , however , was the rate of fuel consumption - teams now had to be very careful not to run out of fuel during the race .
Furthermore , the massive top - end power also created a very steep power curve that many driver 's struggled to manage - for example , the single turbo BMW engine 's power tripled between 6000 and 9000 rpm .
This made driving a challenge - especially when considering the cars were limited to the same wheel and tyre size that had been used since 525 hp atmo engines were the norm !
Note , however , those cars using smaller twin - turbos were reputedly more responsive and progressive than the single turbo competitors .
From here , the horizon drew near for the turbocharged beasts .
The Premature End
With increasing focus on safety and cost , measures were taken to slow the turbo cars .
First , a race - day fuel ration was introduced in 1986 spelling a reduction in boost pressure and the end of any form of anti-lag systems .
Simultaneous improvements in engine management allowed teams to safely run their engines a bit leaner ( to help save fuel ) , but there was still a considerable overall power loss .
Following this , in 1987 , a 4.0 Bar boost limit was introduced whereby a pressure relief vale ( aka pop - off valve ) was fitted to the intake manifold of each car .
Fighting a 4.0 Bar ceiling and tough fuel rations , many teams now reverted back to naturally aspirated engines .
The last straw came in 1988 , when boost was regulated to just 2.5 Bar and a harsher - still race fuel ration was introduced .
This saw even more of the field step backward to naturally aspirated engines in preparation for the announced 1989 turbocharger ban .
Still , with the awesome combination of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at the wheel , the 1988 McLaren - Honda turbo showed its worth by winning an amazing 15 out of 16 races .
To this day , the McLaren - Honda MP4 / 4 remains the most successful F1 car , having won the Driver 's Championship in ' 85 , ' 86 and ' 88 .
Despite this last show of strength , turbochargers were outlawed for the 1989 season and every subsequent F1 car has been naturally aspirated - and considerably less powerful ...
Mankind is responsible for the greatest extinction of wildlife since the end of the dinosaurs , conservationists have said .
Their warning came after a report revealed that populations of animals and plants have plummeted by a third over the last 35 years as a result of hunting , overfishing , habitat destruction and the changing climate .
Humans are increasingly living beyond their means and the world is heading for an ' ecological credit crunch ' , according to the Living Planet Report .
Prepared by the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Zoological Society of London , the report is designed to be a health check for the Earth .
It looked at the fortunes of 1,686 species of animal and plant since the 1970s , based on around 5,000 ongoing monitoring projects .
The report found that populations of all the species fell by 30 per cent between 1970 and 2005 .
The number of land animals fell by a quarter between 1970 and 2005 , while freshwater animals were down by 29 per cent .
Mark Wright , of WWF , said : ' The report shows that populations are dramatically declining .
There is no doubt we are in a period of mass extinction comparable to those from millions of years ago . '
Dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago when a comet crashed into the Gulf of Mexico sending dust into the atmosphere that blocked out the sun .
As well as charting the decline of species , the report looked at each country 's ' ecological footprint ' - the amount of land and sea it needs to provide its natural resources and absorb its waste .
WWF said that if pressure on water , land and wildlife and the output of carbon emissions continue to rise at the current rate , we will need two planets by the 2030s to maintain our lifestyles .
Jonathan Loh , of the ZSL , said : ' We are acting ecologically in the same way as financial institutions have been behaving economically - seeking immediate gratification without due regard for the consequences . '

Barack Obama 's campaign for the White House is receiving increasing complaints about scam pollsters involved in dirty tricks operations to discredit the Democratic candidate .
Victims claim the fake pollsters work insinuations into their questions , designed to damage Obama .
Those targeted in swing states such as Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania include Jews , Christian evangelicals , Catholics and Latinos .
One of those to protest , Debbie Minden , who lives in a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood , Squirrel Hill , in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , told the Guardian that the pollster had begun by asking her the usual questions about her background and who she would vote for .
But the pollster went on to ask Minden , who is Jewish , how she would vote if she knew that Obama was supported by Hamas , the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza and was responsible for most of the suicide bombings against Israel .
" It is scare tactics .
It is terribly underhand , " she said .
The groups behind such polls have not been identified .
One of the Republican groups working on behalf of John McCain 's campaign , the Republican Jewish Coalition , acknowledges carrying out a survey about Jewish voters ' views on Obama and Israel , but insists it was a legitimate exercise intended to test campaign messages on Jewish voters .
The RJC angrily dismissed comparisons between its exercise and a " push poll " , the technique of using fake surveys to sway voters .
Its poll was restricted to 750 people whereas push polls usually involve phoning thousands of people .
It asked 82 questions , only 10 % of which were devoted to Obama .
The technique of push polling is part of the election battle being fought on the ground in the swing states where the margins of victory have been narrow in past elections .
On a bigger scale , teams from each campaign are engaged in legal fights over who is entitled to vote , with Republican groups trying to have people in largely Democratic neighbourhoods disqualified .
Push polling was used with stunning effect in the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina where people claiming to be pollsters insinuated that McCain , then fighting George Bush for the party nomination , had illegitimately fathered a black child .
Bush went on to overturn McCain 's double - digit poll lead in the primaries , and the origin of the calls was never fully established .
This year , the tactic surfaced again during the Republican primaries when calls were made highlighting the religion of one of the candidates , Mitt Romney - he is a Mormon , a religion viewed with suspicion by some on the Christian right .
An Obama campaign organiser in one of the swing states said there had been lots of complaints about push polling in his patch .
Callers said questions frequently included a reference to the widespread belief that Obama is a Muslim , even though he has repeatedly said he is a Christian .
The organiser said another question was : would you be less likely to vote for Obama if Israel had to give up all of Jerusalem ?
" They make this shit up .
They are good at it .
The unassuming listener will not realise it is untrue , " he said .
Minden , a school psychologist , received a call on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of last month .
Living in a swing state , she was not surprised to be polled .
" It sounded like a normal poll .
Was I voting ?
Demographics ?
Age ?
Where we live ?
Then a question about which party I supported , who I preferred on the economy , on foreign policy , questions like that .
" They said ; ' Are you Jewish ? ' and I said ' Yeh ' .
Then they said ' if you knew Barack Obama was supported by Hamas , would it change your vote ?
Would it change your vote if you knew his church had made antisemitic statements ?'.
All the hot button issues on Israel . "
She said she will vote for Obama as planned .
In Key West , Florida , another swing state , Joelna Marcus , 71 , a retired professor , had a similar experience .
She was asked if she would be influenced if she learned that Obama had donated money to the Palestine Liberation Organisation .
Marcus has since disconnected her telephone .
The Huffington Post website reported that a reader , named Rachel from Strongsville , Ohio , complained of a push poll that portrayed Obama as a radical leftwinger who had voted to let convicted child sex offenders out early and to allow them to live near schools .
Paulson Plan Shows A Weakness : Above Market Pricing , Greater Taxpayer Risk
One of the aspects of the Paulson bailout bill that was not clear until today is that the Treasury has no intention of running a true action for the toxic assets on bank balance sheets .
An auction would tend to set very low prices on the current value of mortgage - backed paper .
Based on the few transactions which have taken place in the past , this might be as low as 30 cents on a dollar .
It has been widely assumed that banks would need to take large write - downs on the devalued assets , creating the need for them to raise more capital and further dilute shareholders .
All of those assumptions were mistaken .
In testimony today , Ben Bernanke described the plan by saying “ it is designed to avoid forcing banks to sell or value their mortgage assets at a ` fire - sale ’ price .
In a harsher tone than he has ever used in testimony , Bernanke spelled out the benefits that would accrue when the government can buy these mortgage assets at close to “ hold to maturity ” prices instead of the “ fire - sale price . ”
The plan puts taxpayers at a substantially greater risk than a true auction system .
Buying these toxic assets inexpensively gives the Treasury a chance to profit from its risk if the paper appreciates in value over time , providing taxpayers some “ upside ” .
The more that assets appreciate , the better the chance that the American public ’s long - term liability is low .
What has become clear is that Treasury plans to purchase bad assets from banks at prices very near their original value .
The risk to taxpayers under this program would be tremendous .
If housing prices continue to fall , so will the value of the paper the government has purchased .
Under this set of circumstances the public could be at risk for underwriting the great majority of the Treasury ’s purchases and never having a chance to recoup their investment .
Buying troubled bank assets at above where they would be valued in a free market now and at a price which is near to the potential price when they mature is a great handout to the banks but undermines almost any chance that the Treasury will ever get any meaningful yield from the bailout .
Taxpayers lose any chance of being made whole

If you are transitioning from windows , then in order of preference you will probably want to use , evim makes gvim behave like windows editors ( note Ctrl + L gets you to vim Normal mode ) .
If one just wants the windows key mappings from evim mode in gvim for e.g. you can use the following command : .
Other alternatives if you 're transitioning from windows areor
If you 're stuck with text mode access , then vim is probably the best option , so you need this info ( all of which also applies to gvim and evim ) .
Another reason that it is good to know this is that many programs use vim key bindings .
For e.g. the readline library can be configured to use vi bindings and hence this info will be useful to you in bash , ftp , gnuplot , python , bc , ...
Also less ( used to read man pages on Linux ) defaults to vi key bindings .
Note most commands take an optional number ( of times to run ) on front
( e.g. 3 . repeats the last action 3 times , or 3w moves forward 3 words etc. ) .
Here are my vim settings and my gvim settings .
Command Action
Notes vim file + 54 open file and go to line 54 any : command can be run using + on command line vim - O file1 file2 open file1 and file2 side by side Insert enter insert mode so you can start typing .
Alternatively one can use i or a .
Esc leave insert mode so you can issue commands .
Note in VIM the cursor keys & { Home , End , Page{up , down}} and Delete and Backspace work as expected in any mode , so you do n't need to go back to command mode nearly as much as the origonal vi .
Note even Ctrl+{left , right} jumps words like most other editors .

This morning vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin gave her first policy speech .
She used this time to urge the federal government to fully fund Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) , saying that , " Early identification of a cognitive or other disorder , especially autism , can make a life - changing difference . "
She then went on to say that the amount that Congress spends on earmarks “ is more than the shortfall to fully fund IDEA . ”
And followed that up by ridiculing the projects saying that they , " really do n’t make a whole lot of sense and sometimes these dollars go to projects that have little or nothing to do with the public good .
Things like fruit fly research in Paris , France .
I kid you not . "
The problem is that she is totally unaware that scientific research done on fruit flies has led to important discoveries that have boosted autism research .
This was seen at a study conducted at he University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine , which by the way Mr. Palin is not in Paris , have shown that , " a protein called neurexin is required for .. nerve cell connections to form and function correctly .
The discovery , made in Drosophila fruit flies may lead to advances in understanding autism spectrum disorders , as recently , human neurexins have been identified as a genetic risk factor for autism . "
The study of fruit flies has also been used in other forms of research and , according to ScienceDaily , has " revolutionized " the way birth defects are studied and identified .
This just goes to show how out of touch Ms. Palin really is .
She has a child with autism yet publicly criticizes the people and funds that go towards bettering the lives of developmentally disabled people - I kid you not .

Enlarge By Eric Gay , AP The Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio could be one of the labs mentioned in an upcoming government report calling for higher security at such facilities .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Another frightening new government report is heightening fears about the safety of U.S. biodefense laboratories that study some of the world 's deadliest germs .
The latest worry : Intruders could easily break into two of the labs due to lax security .
Now some lawmakers and members of a new citizen coalition are asking whether it's time for a timeout in the expansion of the Bush administration 's biowarfare defense program .
The Bush administration decided after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks that the nation needed to develop cures , drug treatments , vaccines and diagnostic tests to combat germs that could be used in a terrorist attack or accidentally released .
And , while U.S. officials say there are no known incidents where outsiders attacked anyone with germs from a U.S. lab , the FBI concluded last summer that a microbiologist at the Army 's lab in Ft. Detrick , Md. was responsible for anthrax attacks in 2001 .
Two House lawmakers and members of a new citizen coalition — people " living in the shadow " of these labs — say the defensive biowarfare program has expanded too fast since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Security measures have not caught up , they said .
The latest government study , initially obtained by The Associated Press and released publicly Thursday , found that intruders could easily break into two laboratories handling organisms that could cause illnesses with no cure .
The AP identified the vulnerable lab locations as Atlanta and San Antonio .
The Government Accountability Office did not identify the labs except to say they were classified as Biosafety Level 4 facilities — requiring the highest level of security .
But the report included enough details for the AP — and others knowledgeable about such labs — to determine their locations .
In Texas , the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research features an outside window that looks directly into the room where the deadly germs are handled .
The lab , which is privately run , also lacks sufficient security cameras , intrusion detection alarms or visible armed guards at its public entrances .
Officials there said they will tighten security .
" We already have an initiative underway to look at perimeter security , " said Kenneth Trevett , president of the lab in San Antonio .
" We 're waiting for additional input but we 're not waiting long .
The GAO would like us to do some fairly significant things .
They would like us to do it sooner rather than later . "
The other lab described with weak security in the report is operated by Georgia State University in Atlanta .
That lab lacked complete security barriers and any integrated security system , including any live monitoring by security cameras .
During their review , investigators said they watched an unidentified pedestrian enter the building through an unguarded loading dock .
" Georgia State clearly wants its BSL - 4 to be as safe as possible , " said DeAnna Hines , assistant vice president for university relations .
" We are already taking steps that will enhance the lab 's safety and security standards . "
Hines did not confirm the school 's research lab was the one mentioned in the congressional report as lacking proper security .
The new report , coupled with several investigative findings over the past year , revealed security and safety problems covering every aspect of the facilities : poor perimeter security , a growing number of accidents inside the labs , and the FBI conclusion last summer that a civilian Army scientist at Ft. Detrick , Md. was behind deadly anthrax attacks in 2001 .
Beth Willis , a member of the citizen group from Frederick , Md. near Ft. Detrick , said , " We understand we 're not going to make the labs go away but we have a lot of concerns about safety .
" Biomedical research is very important .
We 're not saying it all should stop .
We are saying the size and scale of the ramp - up with pathogens , considered by the government to be biowarfare pathogens , is a dangerous thing , " Willis said .
" It 's an opportunity to say ' time out ' and address this . "
Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich. , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , repeated this week his call for suspension of all further design and construction of biodefense laboratories until security problems are fixed .
In a letter to President Bush in August , Dingell and Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Mich . , urged the suspension of all further design and construction of laboratories in the program — until security problems are fixed .
" We found that many of the labs are probably unnecessary or redundant .
Shockingly , the Government Accountability Office reported that no one in the government even knows the total number of BSL ( Biosafety Level ) 3 and 4 labs currently in existence .
" Ironically , their proliferation has only exacerbated the potential risk of a terrorist incident or accidental release , not enhanced our nation 's security . "
BSL - 3 and BSL - 4 laboratories are those handling the most dangerous germs and toxins and requiring the most stringent security .
The BSL - 4 labs handle organisms that cause diseases without a cure .
They include ebola , marburg , junin and lassa viruses .
Five BSL - 4 labs operate now , but the number could triple with labs planned or under construction , the GAO said .

It was 11:30 in the morning , and Dante ( as we 'll call him ) was more than ready for lunch .
His stomach let out a low growl to remind him that he 'd skipped breakfast and had a light dinner the previous night .
Embarrassed , he leaned forward to stifle the growl .
Just 30 more minutes .
Dante wished he could go to lunch right then , but his colleague that he was going with was in a meeting until noon .
He tried to keep his thoughts on other things , but could n't stay focused .
His pencil cup looked like it was full of pretzels , his wall clock looked like a cake , and the nearby receptionist looked like ham .
His hallucinations were interrupted by the phone .
" Yeah , Dante , this is * SNORT * Earl .
Gonna need you to * HACK * come down by my office for a bit . "
His caller then spit what could only be described as a phlegmy disaster .
The kind of horror that defies otomotopeia .
Dante knew about Earl .
Everyone did .
Other people make their presence known by politely knocking on the cubicle wall , Earl made his presence known by his stench , which you 'd smell well before you actually saw him .
Some referred to his smell as " The Blight . "
It was a combination of cigarette smoke and B.O. that Earl must have worked at to perfect the balance to cause the most discomfort possible .
Nearly forgetting that he had been on the phone , Dante asked if it would take long .
" Nah , * COUGH * five minutes , tops . "
Dante was n't far from Earl 's office , but was thankfully outside of its smell radius .
As soon as he passed that threshold , however , all desire for lunch immediately left .
The walk to Earl 's office always reminded Dante of the scene from The Shining with blood pouring out of the elevator , only in this case it was sweat and cigarette smoke pouring out of a modest 8 'x10 ' office .
Dante 's eyes were almost tearing up in response to the godawful smell .
He did his best to persevere , and rapped on the door twice .
" Dante !
How 's * SNORT * it hangin ' ? "
He extended a sweaty hand , paused , wiped it on his pants near his yellowed pockets , extended his hand again , with Dante all the while trying to figure out a polite way to avoid shaking his hand .
It was n't that Dante was disrespectful , it 's just that the guy was filthy .
He 'd transferred yellow cigarette stains from his fingers to his pockets , and Dante had never seen Earl wear a different pair of pants .
His office smelled bad enough on its own , but while Earl was in the room , it was almost unbearable .
" So what 's the problem ? "
Dante 's face wrinkled — he could practically taste the stench .
The humidity was turning the place into a giant Ikea - decorated petri dish .
Dante would n't have been surprised if one of the folders in a messy pile on the floor started crawling away .
Somehow Earl had the only humid office in the building .
" Computer 's on the fritz .
I tried my ' home remedy ' for the past few weeks , but she 's not always turning on .
She starts up maybe 25 % of the time . "
Dante had to stay focused so he could escape the stinky torture chamber quickly .
Why did n't he tell us about this weeks ago , when his system stopped working consistently , he thought .
During their conversation , Earl was doing something peculiar — he was hanging a white towel on a makeshift assembly of twisted coat hangers , tape , paperclips , and pens that was hanging over a boiling kettle on a hot plate .
Apparently he just liked hot towels .
Hard to blame him , getting a hot , damp towel is the best part of any long flight .
Earl leaned over and removed a towel from under his desk , and hung that on his homemade towel rack .
In the same motion , he grabbed a moist , hot towel from off the rack and placed it in the same area behind his desk that he'd just taken one from .
Dante kept one suspicious eye on the towel rack , expecting it to collapse onto the hot plate and catch fire .
Dante 's eyes widened , and it must have been obvious because Earl snorted an inquisitive " What ? ! "
Dante said nothing , instead taking a few steps forward to see behind his desk .
It took all of his willpower to brave the stench even more by stepping further into the stench .
He could taste the bile rising up in the back of his throat .
Dante gasped at the sight .
Earl had been covering his PC 's vents with hot towels .
And the areas of the PC that would 've been visible if not for the towels were obscured by discarded fast food wrappers .
The time for politeness had passed , and Dante was going to pass out if he did n't get out of there soon .
The humidity , the trash , and Earl himself were in the perfect incubator for the unbearable smell .
" What the hell are you doing ? ! "
Earl recoiled a bit , startled by Dante 's yelling .
" It 's just ... I figured ...
It was so dry in here - I figured all the static was gettin ' to 'er . "
Earl mistook Dante 's furrowed brow as a request for clarification of his theory .
" I figured if I upped the humiderty a bit , she might stop pitchin ' a fit . "
Dante looked down at his watch .
11:38 .
The past eight minutes had felt like eighty .
He 'd entered the humid , slimy belly of the beast and had to make his escape .
" Look , I 've got an appointment for lunch .
I 'll call when I get back . "
Dante spent the next twenty or so minutes walking around , drinking water from the drinking fountain , and remaining near a bathroom in case the need to vomit arose .
Dante 's lunch was uneventful — his body was hungry , but he really did n't feel like eating after braving The Blight for nearly ten minutes .
Upon returning to the office , he asked Earl to disconnect his computer and bring it to his desk .
Dante discovered the original problem - a bad NIC .
Though that issue was upstaged by the new problem — rusted , corroded components from the damp towels .

In a nationally televised speech on September 24 , George W. Bush said in support of the proposed bailout plan that it was meant to “ help American consumers and businessmen get credit to meet their daily needs and to create jobs . ”
The Bailout Lie Exposed
Bush ’s story was subsequently peddled by the Ministry of Information : the more than 700 billion handed over by the Treasury and the Fed to the financial oligarchy will be used to enable banks to resume lending to strapped households and businesses , thereby enabling the economy to regain healthy rates of growth and households and businesses to elude the prospect of extended debt peonage .
But astute observers knew full well that there can be no “ regaining ” of robust growth rates that had already disappeared with the onset of Reagan / Thatcher neoliberalism .
And reflating the housing bubble by encouraging already maxed - out working people and small businesses to dig themselves into a deeper debt grave seems like a recipe for heightening economic catastrophe .
But not to worry : the bad guys were not chimps after all .
They had no intention of using the proceeds of the giveaway to lend to anyone .
We can thank the New York Times ’s surprisingly intrepid economics reporter Joe Nocera for this revelation .
In an unexpected adventure in extra-curricular empiricism , Nocera reported in Saturday ’s NYT that he was able to gain access to a recording of an employee - only October 17 conference call by a top ( unnamed ) executive of JPMorgan Chase , the beneficiary of $ 25 billion of federal largesse .
At one point in the conference one participant asked whether the $ 25 billion will “ change our strategic lending policy . ”
The executive then proceeded to spill the beans : “ What we do think , it will help us to be a little bit more active on the acquisition side or opportunistic side for some banks who are still struugling . ”
Translation : “ Say what ?
Lend to folks up to their ears in debt already ?!
Do we look like morons ??
You know as well as I that breakneck financial consolidation has been the name of the game since the early nineties .
So have leveraged buyouts .
Only the latter are normally accomplished with private money .
Now we get to leverage bank acquisitions with public money !
Is this a deal or is this a deal ? ”
The executive assures his questioner that JPMC ’s voracious appetite for gobbling up debt hawkers was not sated by its recent government - backed digestion of two major competitors : “ And I would not assume that we are done on the acquisition side just because of the Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns mergers .
I think that there are going to be some great opportunities for us to grow in this environment , and I think we have an opportunity to use that $ 25 billion in that way , and obviously depending on whether recession turns into depression or what happens in the future , you know , we have that as a backstop . ”
Moments later the exec speaks openly about Morgan ’s intentions regarding loans :
“ We would think that loan volume will continue to go down as we continue to tighten credit to fully reflect the high cost of pricing on the loan side . ”
Was all this taking place behind Paulson ’s back ?
Not at all .
In fact , we have decisive evidence that Paulson ’s stated rationale for the bailout was sheer mendacity .
There was virtually no mention in the mainstream press of Paulson ’s move earlier this month to promote the further concentration of bank wealth .
He enacted a new multi-billion - dollar tax break allowing an acquiring bank to immediately deduct any losses on the books of the acquired bank .
The message is not lost on the Times ’s Nocera : “ It is starting to appear as if ….
Treasury wants banks to acquire each other and is using its power to inject capital to force a new and wrenching round of bank consolidation . ”
As venal as this may make Paulson and the political decision makers –most of whom are full aware of the real rationale of the bailout - appear , no one may accuse them of inconsistency .
The bailout conveniently imposes no lending requirements on the banks .
The Ongoing Consolidation of Wealth As A Capitalist Tradition
What we are witnessing is the working out in the financial sector of a structural tendency of capitalism that became evident in the middle of the nineteenth century .
I refer to the gradual but inexorable diminution of competition in major markets .
Initially , the reduction of competition happens as a normal outcome of the developmental dynamics of economic growth .
Firms in a given industry grow at different rates ; some firms grow faster than others .
Larger firms produce on a larger scale , thus enabling reductions in per-unit costs which in turn gives the larger firm a competitive advantage vis -à - vis smaller - scale higher - cost producers .
Some of the latter fail and are absorbed by the bigger winners , conferring on them greater market access , higher profits and still greater competitive advantage .
When very large firms reach the point of becoming household names , with established relations with suppliers and more effective marketing capabilities , they thereby create barriers to entry into the industry .
Competition is further reduced .
And the winners love it .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Capitalists hate and fear competition , which if left “ free ” would force them to price - compete themselves to subsistence level profits .
How could it not occur to them to consciously devise arrangements designed to limit competition ?
Adam Smith detected this tendency in the late eighteenth century .
“ People in the same trade seldom meet together , ” he wrote in The Wealth of Nations , “ … but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ”
Toward the end of the nineteenth century capitalists had the presence of mind to form “ combinations ” with the conscious goal of controlling competition by coordinating policies .
Fixing prices , setting production quota and dividing markets were the most common methods .
First there was the “ gentleman ’s agreement , ” then the pool , the cartel , the trust and finally the merger , which has become in the post - War period the typical means of consolidating more and more wealth in fewer and fewer hands .
Since the early 1970s industrial investment has declined , and financial investment has risen , as a share of total business investment .
Accordingly bank mergers have , from 1973 to the present , risen , and ( non-financial ) corporate mergers declined , as a share of all mergers .
By the 1990s the pace of bank mergers had gone haywire .
Paulson and his buddies have devised a plunder agenda that has long been in preparation , but could hardly be imposed in normal conditions .
It has now been made possible by the crisis generated by the financial community ’s own shenanigans .
In the decanting phase of the current crisis , a few mega - banks will come to dominate U.S. finance with historically unparalleled market power .
Economic austerity will be visited upon workers , students , small businesses and yes , even upon a few former industrial giants .
( Think of the auto companies . )
What would an Obama administration ’s response be to the plummeting fortunes of working people ?
Obama - Biden ’s Heads - Up : The Coming Assault On Ordinary Folks
Joe Biden ’s recent Seattle speech to a group of Democratic insiders and fundraisers frankly announced the candidates ’ apparently eager anticipation of an international crisis which would require Obama to prove his mettle .
These remarks have received well deserved attention , but there has been virtually nothing in the press about the implications of Biden ’s remarks for Obama ’s domestic policies .
Biden spoke about two major issues - the economic / financial crisis and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - in connection with what he predicted would be widespread popular hostility to an Obama administration ’s policies .
“ [ Obama ] ’s going to need you to use your influence , your influence within the community , to stand with him ” , Biden told his audience , “ Because it ’s not going to be apparent initially , it ’s not going to be apparent that we ’re right …
There are going to be a lot of you who want to go , ‘ Whoa , wait a minute , yo , whoa , whoa , I did n’t know about that decision . ’
Because if you think the decision is sound when they ’re made , which I believe you will when they ’re made , they ’re not likely to be as popular as they are sound .
Because if they ’re popular , they ’re probably not sound … .
I promise you , you all are going to be sitting here a year from now going , ‘ Oh my God , why are they there in the polls , why is the polling so down , why is this thing so tough ? ’
We ’re going to have to make some incredibly tough decisions in the first two years . ”
Note Biden ’s implied contempt for the rabble : “ if they ’re popular , they ’re probably not sound . ”
Biden is warning his well - heeled audience that an Obama administration ’s response to both foreign and domestic crisis will appall not only the unwashed masses , but the hipoisie as well .
The domestic policies in question are of course the extensive social cutbacks that the administration will want to foist upon a working population already devastated by what will certainly be the effects of deepening recession accompanied by ongoing financial meltdown : soaring unemployment , threats to remaining employment , mounting homelessness , declining wages and both actual and impending bankruptcies .
It is an Obama administration ’s indifference to these afflictions that will provoke much of the widespread opposition that Biden anticipates .
The New York Times ’s October 23 endorsement of Obama reflects elite enthusiasm for his anti-New - Deal neoliberalism .
The Times quotes selected remarks from Obama ’s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention .
The selections are revealing .
“ Government cannot solve all our problems , but what it should do is …protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education ; keep our water clean and our toys safe ; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology . ”
Reaganism pure and simple : guaranteed right to health care , no ; safe toys , yes .
The Times also praises Obama for his calls for “ shared sacrifice and social responsibility ” , well established code words for resignation to austerity and cuts in social spending .
Do n’t be surprised if Wall Street ’s new main man soon becomes the guy Main Street loves to hate .

ROME ( Reuters ) -
An Italian museum on Thursday defied Pope Benedict and refused to remove a modern art sculpture portraying a crucified green frog holding a beer mug and an egg that the Vatican had condemned as blasphemous .
The board of the Museion museum in the northern city of Bolzano decided by a majority vote that the frog was a work of art and would stay in place for the remainder of an exhibition .
The wooden sculpture by the late German artist Martin Kippenberger depicts a frog about 1 meter 30 cm ( 4 feet ) high nailed to brown cross and holding a beer mug in one outstretched hand and an egg in another .
Called “ Zuerst die Fuesse , ” ( Feet First ) , it wears a green loin cloth and is nailed through the hands and the feet in the manner of Jesus Christ .
Its green tongue hangs out of its mouth .
Kippenberger ’s works have been shown at the Tate Modern and the Saatchi Gallery in London and at the Venice Biennale , and retrospectives are planned in Los Angeles and New York .
Museum officials said the artist , who died in 1997 , considered it a self - portrait illustrating human angst .
Pope Benedict , who is German himself and was recently on holiday not far from Bolzano , did not agree .
The Vatican wrote a letter of support in the pope ’s name to Franz Pahl , president of the regional government who opposed the sculpture .
Pahl released parts of the letter , which said the work “ wounds the religious sentiments of so many people who see in the cross the symbol of God ’s love ” .
Pahl , whose province is heavily Catholic , was so outraged by the sculpture of the pop-eyed amphibian that he went on a hunger strike to demand its removal and had to be taken to hospital during the summer .
“ Surely this is not a work of art but a blasphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people , ” Pahl told Reuters by telephone .
“ This decision to keep the statue there is totally unacceptable .
It is a grave offence to our Catholic population , ” he said .
Museum president Alois Lageder told Reuters the decision to keep the statue on display was made in order to “ safeguard the autonomy of art institutions ” .
The board vote was 6 - 3 in favor .
Art experts defended the work .
“ Art must always be free and the artist should not have any restrictions on freedom of expression , ” Claudio Strinati , a superintendent for Rome ’s state museums , told an Italian newspaper on Thursday .
But Italy ’s culture minister , Sandro Bondi , said museums that receive state funds should not “ exalt artworks of desecration , of useless provocation and of nonsense ” .
Scrabble knockoff Scrabulous has been taken off Facebook for good , and not just in the US and Canada , either .
The popular social networking site has removed access to the application from users in the UK and Australia , effectively leaving it completely inaccessible except from India , from whence it originates .
Scrabulous ' removal from Facebook comes a month after Hasbro , owner of Scrabble here in the US and Canada , filed a lawsuit against Scrabulous ' developers for copyright and trademark infringement .
Although its creators , Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla , were n't pleased with the lawsuit , they voluntarily removed access to the program from North America in order to appease Hasbro , but kept it accessible internationally .
Unfortunately for the Agarwallas , that was n't quite enough .
The involuntary removal of Scrabulous outside of North America was the result of a takedown notice sent by Mattel , which owns the international rights to Scrabble .
In a statement sent to Inside Facebook , Jayant Agarwalla said that Mattel had approached the Indian courts in February seeking an order to take down Scrabulous , but that the court had not yet made a judgment .
" It surprises us that Mattel chose to direct Facebook to take down Scrabulous without waiting for the Hon'ble High Court 's decision .
Mattel 's action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary , " he said .
" It is even more astonishing that Facebook , which claims to be a fair and neutral party , took this step even though they were fully aware of the circumstances under which the Mattel letter was sent to them . "
The Agarwallas now await the decision of the Indian courts as to whether the application will be blocked in their home country as well .
In the meantime , the brothers have still relaunched the app as Wordscraper , careful to avoid any possible reference to Scrabble in its documentation , design , or even color combinations .
So far , it appears as if Hasbro and Mattel — both of which have been marketing their own Facebook version of Scrabble instead — have left Wordscraper alone , but for how long ?
Hasbro 's copyright only covers certain implementations of the game , not the general concept of lining up letters to form words and scoring points from them .
As a result , the Agarwallas may be able to stay out of reach of legal complaints this time around .

Zawahiri also claimed the recent security gains made by US forces in Iraq were only temporary and Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's offers to negotiate with Taliban elements were a sign of his regime 's weakness .
Qaeda 's Zawahri says U.S. wars behind financial crisis 28 Nov 2008 Al Qaeda 's second - in - command said in an Internet video the U.S. financial crisis was caused by Washington 's military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan and taxpayers were paying the price .
" This crisis is one of ... the series of American economic hemorrhages after the strikes of September 11 ...
And these ... will continue as long as the foolish American policy of wading in Muslim blood continues , " Ayman al - Zawahri said on the video , posted on Islamist websites on Friday .

In al - Qaida 's first response to Obama 's victory , al - Zawahri also called the president - elect -- along with secretaries of state Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice -- " house negroes . "

But al - Qaida supplied English subtitles of his speech [ LOL ! ] that included the translation as " house negroes . "

Al - Qaeda No. 2 , Ayman al - Zawahri , was ' killed , ' then wounded , then re-killed -- but through all of his deaths and injuries , he is still able to produce videotapes .

Short excerpts of the message were aired on the Arab satellite news channel Al - Jazeera .
In them , al - Qaida Number 2 , Ayman al - Zawahri , accused Iran of working with U.S. forces .
Al - Zawahri said Tehran was " co-operating with the Americans in occupying Iraq and Afghanistan " and slammed Iran for recognizing the two governments .
He also criticized the Shiites for not calling for a jihad in Iraq against the " Crusader occupier . "
In militant postings , " crusaders " is shorthand for U.S. troops in Iraq .
Timeline - Messages attributed to al Qaeda 's Zawahri 08 Sep 2008 ' Al Qaeda ' has issued a video marking the September 11 attacks , in which deputy group leader Ayman al - Zawahri accuses Iran of taking part in a Western " Crusader " war against Islam , Al Jazeera television said on Monday .

Ayman al - Zawahiri Killed in Predator Strike ?
02 Aug 2008
Al Qaeda number 2 Ayman al - Zawahiri was severely wounded in a US predator strike earlier this week , CBS is reporting .
Ayman al - Zawahiri - the second most powerful leader in al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden ’s No. 2 - may be critically wounded and possibly dead , CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Lara Logan reports exclusively ...
A counter - intelligence expert and other U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that the U.S. is looking into reports that al - Zawahiri is dead .
CBS News reports :
Exclusive : Al Qaeda No. 2 Injured ?
Unverified Letter Obtained By CBS News Urgently Requests Doctor to Treat Ayman al - Zawahiri 01 Aug 2008 Ayman al - Zawahiri - the second most powerful leader in al Qaeda [ al - CIAduh ] and Osama Bin Laden 's No. 2 - may be critically wounded and possibly dead , CBS News reports exclusively .
CBS
News has obtained a copy of an intercepted letter from sources in Pakistan , which urgently requests a doctor to treat al - Zawahiri .
He 's believed to be somewhere in Pakistan 's remote tribal areas .
The letter refers to Sheikh Dr. Ayman al - Zawahiri by name - and says that he is in " severe pain " and his " injuries are infected . "
It is reportedly written by local Taliban leader , Baitullah Mehsud , whose signature and seal are visible on the letter .
The Taliban logo and the Mehsud 's seal have been confirmed by experts as legitimate .
The letter is dated July 29 - one day after a U.S. air strike that [ re- ] killed al Qaeda weapons expert Abu Khabab al - Masri , and five other Arabs in South Waziristan .
Telegraph.co.uk reports :
Al - Qaeda number two al - Zawahiri reported injured by US missile -- Al - Qa'eda 's deputy leader has been wounded and may even have died after a US missile strike in a tribal area along Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan , according to a report .
02 Aug 2008 US broadcaster CBS said it had obtained an intercepted letter from a Pakistani Taliban commander requesting urgent medical help for Ayman al - Zawahiri , Osama bin Laden 's right - hand man .
Pakistan 's military said it had no information about the report .
Chief Pakistani military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said : " There is no evidence or information in this regard .
We have no reliable information . "
Al - Zawahiri has been mistakenly reported killed before in the remote and hostile area where he is believed to be hiding along with other surviving al - Qaeda leaders .
But , looky here !
Musharraf confirms ' al - Qaeda ' hit 11 Feb 2006 Pakistan 's president has confirmed that " a close relative " of al - Qaeda number two Ayman al - Zawahiri was killed in a US air strike in Pakistan last month .
Pervez Musharraf also confirmed for the first time that Zawahiri had been expected to be at the house targeted by the US , a military spokesman says .
President Musharraf added that another wanted militant was among five foreigners killed in the bombing .
Eighteen local people died in the raid , sparking widespread anger .
" Five foreigners were killed in the US attack , " Gen Musharraf told tribal leaders in north - western Pakistan , the Associated Press news agency reports .
" One of them was a close relative of Ayman al - Zawahri and the other man was wanted by the US and had a US $ 5 million ( 4.19 million euro ) reward on his head . "
Shortly after the raid , unconfirmed intelligence reports said three high - ranking al - Qaeda members were among those killed in the raid on a village in the Bajaur Agency region on the border with Afghanistan .
They named Egyptian bomb expert Midhat Mursi - information on whose whereabouts carries a $ 5 m US bounty .
Border village
When news of the attack first emerged , there were reports that Ayman al - Zawahiri had been killed .
He has eluded capture since the US overthrew the Taleban in Afghanistan in 2001 - despite a $ 25 m bounty on his head .
Osama Bin Laden 's second - in - command is regarded as the ideological brains behind the al - Qaeda network .
The raid took place in the village of Damadola in the Bajaur tribal area , about 7 km ( 4.5 miles ) from the Afghan border .

Standard reference check questions have become so rote that I can rattle them off half - asleep .
How long did the candidate work with you ?
What were the candidate ’s strengths and weaknesses ?
Was he a team player ?*
The clichés repeat , ad nauseam .
Doubtless , some questions are essential .
You ca n’t judge an employee ’s performance without knowing what they did for former companies .
However , unexpected questions can produce surprising insights , helping you amp up your hiring intelligence .
Try these 8 questions and see what kinds of answers you get :
( First four questions inspired by JayScott.com )
1 . Were you asked to be a reference by ( candidate name ) ?
2 . What did he learn during his time with your company ?
3 . If you could give him a single career suggestion , what would it be ?
4 . What circumstances frustrate him the most ?
5 . How well does he manage pressure , stress , or crises ?
6 . ( If reference managed the client )
How did the candidate respond to your management style ?
7 . Would you rehire him ?
8 . Can you refer me to someone he did n’t get along with ?
Can you think of any other surprising — but sane — reference check questions ?
* This terminology needs to be chucked out of the lexicon .
Perhaps “ Does he bite ? ” is a more apt question .

Americans are now feeling the real squeeze between warfare zealots and anti-development environmentalists as the price of gasoline continues to skyrocket .
In a recent article for Bloomberg.com , Alexander Kwiatkowski notes that the most recent $ 5 spike in crude oil prices to a record high of $ 146.90 has resulted from . . .
concerns that Israel may be preparing to attack Iran , while a strike in Brazil and renewed militant activity in Nigeria threaten to cut supplies .
Oil rallied to a record high of $ 146.90 a barrel in New York after the Jerusalem Post said Israeli war planes practiced over Iraq , adding to speculation the country is preparing to attack Iran .
A Brazilian union said it plans a five - day strike on platforms that pump 80 percent of the country ’s crude and Nigerian militants pledged to renew attacks on oil facilities .
. . . .
Gasoline prices in the U.S. rose to a record .
Futures for August delivery rose as much as 10.46 cents , or 3 percent , to $ 3.6155 a gallon on Nymex .
The average price of a gallon of gasoline at the pump in the U.S was $ 4.11 on July 8 , according to AAA , 38 percent higher than a year earlier .
For an up - to - date and graphic plotting since 1947 of the effect of Mideast wars on oil prices , including how real oil prices have steadily increased since 9/11 , go here .
Meanwhile , many politicos and environmentalists oppose ending oil development restrictions in the U.S. , especially pertaining to offshore drilling , with one of the most hysterical and foolish commentaries appearing in a column in the San Francisco Chronicle , supporting the neo-mercantilist ( corporatist ? ) drilling moratorium that was implemented by Bush ’s father when he was president .
And , a further editorial in the Chronicle fears increased drilling overall .
( In contrast , Senior Fellow William Shughart points out here and here why freeing up markets is the solution to the oil pricing crisis .
And , environmental harms are trivial so long as resources are owned and managed privately and not through government bureaucracies , with property rights for all parties fully protected from trespass . )
Barack Obama , Al Gore , Arnold Schwarzenegger , and Nancy Pelosi recently declared their firm opposition to any increase in offshore drilling , with Gore even equating offshore oil drilling to the invasion of Iraq .
Never mind the fact that it is the federal government that invaded and now occupies both Iraq as well as the continental shelf .
Similarly , the chorus of warfarists continues its mantra for endless U.S. interventionism in the Mideast , guaranteeing a continuation of record oil prices on futures markets and at the pump , with John McCain claiming that the U.S. has “ succeeded and we need to continue the strategy . ”
In Kansas City , MO , he stated :
I am happy to stand in front of you to tell you that this strategy has succeeded .
It has succeeded .
It has succeeded .
And later in the day he added that :
The strategy has worked and we now have the Iraqi government and military in charge in the major cities in Iraq .
Al Qaeda is on their heels and on the run .
Meanwhile , Obama has set a 16 - month timetable to begin withdrawing U.S. troops , and asked when the U.S. military should leave the country , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki directly answered :
As soon as possible , as far as we ’re concerned .
U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months .
That , we think , would be the right time frame for a withdrawal , with the possibility of slight changes .
Those who operate on the premise of short time periods in Iraq today are being more realistic .
Artificially prolonging the tenure of U.S. troops in Iraq would cause problems .
Of course , this is by no means an election endorsement .
Who they choose as their president is the Americans ’ business .
But it ’s the business of Iraqis to say what they want .
No sign of McCain retracting his view that the U.S. should remain in Iraq for a 100 - years war and then even for 1,000 or 10,000 years .
In contrast , Obama ’s proposal for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq is indeed laudable and well - overdue , and would have a powerful effect on driving down oil prices .
However , since he incredibly wants then to send these troops on to Afghanistan to fight the “ real front ” and even into Pakistan ( also see here ) while maintaining a major presence of the U.S. in Iraq , war will only at best be shifted to other fronts ( and more probably widened and escalated ) , with oil prices likely to go even higher in the process .
And on top of this , his opposition to oil development will only make matters worse .
So much for the candidate of “ change ” and his “ new strategy . ”
Better to consult our Senior Fellow Ivan Eland on the need for the U.S. to exit Iraq and disengage overall from the U.S. ’s ill - fated and hubristic worldwide empire of 800 + bases and policy of endless , invasive war .
In this regard , the updated edition of his book , The Empire Has No Clothes , plus that by Robert Higgs and Carl Close , Opposing the Crusader State , are must reads .

COLUMBUS , Ohio ( CNN ) --
The Web site of the Ohio secretary of state was back up and running Tuesday , a day after officials pulled the site partially offline when it was hacked by unknown outsiders .
Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner says her office has received death threats .
Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner told CNN that " fortunately " no sensitive material was breached in the incident .
" We found it in time that we were able to mitigate any problems , " she said .
However , Brunner said it was n't the first time her office , which has been embroiled in an ongoing dispute with the state Republican Party over alleged voter registration fraud , has been targeted and that death threats have been part of the package .
" There 's been a concerted effort to barrage the office with e-mails and phone calls , " she said , " not just to our elections division but to business services division .
My employees have been real troopers here .
" The First Amendment is alive and well in the United States , and you know that , and they 're not coming just from Ohio .
A lot of times , they 're coming from other states .
But this is all part of the process .
And my employees are doing a fantastic job of staying focused on what they need to do . "
Brunner said the Ohio Highway Patrol is investigating the hack , the calls and e-mails , as well as a suspicious package with a message that said " Death to Obama supporters " and an unidentified powder .
That package , addressed to an old office building , was delivered by her office by mail last week , she said .
The secretary attributed the troubles to the " contentious nature " of the litigation begun by the Ohio Republican Party .
Last week , the U.S. Supreme Court blocked a lower court order directing Brunner -- a Democrat -- to update the state 's voter registration database after information provided by some newly registered voters did not match up with Social Security and driver registration numbers .
The state Republican Party had asked for enforcement of a temporary restraining order , but the justices , in an unsigned order , denied that request .
Brunner and other elections officials had appealed an earlier ruling from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati siding with the state GOP .
The state Republican Party contends that there is widespread voter fraud in Ohio , considered by many to be a crucial battleground state for the 2008 presidential election .
Officials also allege Brunner " turned off " its process for verifying voter registrations while allowing Ohioans to cast ballots on the same day they registered .
State GOP Chairman Bob Bennett has accused Brunner of concealing fraudulent voter registrations in hopes of swinging the state to Sen. Barack Obama , the Democratic presidential candidate .
Voter registration fraud involves submitting registration forms for people not eligible to vote , and rarely turns into the more serious crime of voter fraud , in which people knowingly vote illegally in an attempt to defraud the election system .
Most voter registration fraud cases involve registrars , hired by non-profit organizations to register people to vote , who submit forms they filled out themselves rather than collected from actual potential voters , according to the Brennan Center for Justice .
Cases of actual voter fraud are themselves extremely rare , the center said .
Republican Party officials are challenging voter registration in several swing states in this election cycle , prompting charges from some Democrats that the GOP is attempting to suppress the Democratic vote .
Similar charges were leveled in 2004 when George W. Bush narrowly defeated John Kerry in Ohio to secure a second term , but the Department of Justice failed to uncover any evidence of intentional vote suppression .
CNN 's Mary Snow contributed to this report .

Central Banks Starting to Buy Gold ?
Gold rose yesterday despite continuing dollar strength and falling oil prices ( gold closed at $ 880.80 up $ 6.80 while s ilver closed at $ 12.71 up 53 cents ) .
Once again in after hours trading there was determined selli ng which pushed the price as low as $ 862 / oz in Asia prior to rallying in early European trade to over $ 870 / oz .
There appear to be good support in the $ 850 / oz to 860 / oz region but given the unprecedented nature of the volatil ity in global financial markets anything is possible in the short term and leveraged trading is not advisable .
I nterbank pressures remain elevated with a further rise in three month rates led by dollar Libor rising 4.15 % and premiums for European bank bonds are now at record levels .
Thus , financial and systemic risk remains elevated which will support gold .
But w ith gold up significantly in the last 3 weeks it may need to consolidate between $ 850 and $ 910 prior to rechallenging $ 1,000 / oz in the coming weeks .
EUR and GBP gold remain very firm as the euro and British pound weaken as financial and economic woes are becoming more pronounced in the Eurozone and the UK .
Western Central Banks Curtailing Gold Sales and Other Central Banks Buying Gold
Western central bank gold sales continue to fall while Russian and other large creditor nations such as China and OPEC nations with huge dollar denominated reserves and assets are believed to be increasing the percentage of gold that they hold in their currency reserves .
Contagion in the financial markets and U.S. dollar vulnerability are bolstering gold 's reputation as the central monetary anchor within the international monetary system .
Gold sales by European central banks ( the largest holders besides the Federal Reserve of gold in the world ) under the Central Bank Gold Agreement ( CBGA ) in the year to September 26 were provisionally estimated at a record low 357.2 tonnes , the World Gold Council said on Wednesday .
Sales in the final year of the pact could be lower still , the WGC added .
Under the terms of the CBGA , signatories can sell up to 500 tonnes of gold per year .
With the advent of the euro , European central banks began diversifying their reserves which were overweight in gold .
The gold sales were the lowest since the central bank gold agreement in 1999 .
Financial market instability , concerns about the dollar and huge systemic risk are making gold more attractive as a reserve asset for central banks .
Governments and central bankers who sell their gold are likely to be asked very hard questions in the coming years .
Already Gordon Brown 's decision to sell much of the UK's gold in 1999 at near record low prices has been criticised .
Some have even suggested that the sales have weakened the UK 's monetary position and increase risks to the vulnerable pound .
The German Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank confirm ed this week that they will not be selling any more of their gold reserves .
The SNB said it does n't plan a further reduction of its gold reserves , which now stand at 1040 metric tons .
Recently , the Bundesbank reaffirmed its belief in the importance of retaining significant holdings of gold bullion in their monetary reserves .
The Bundesbank has said that financial and political uncertainty make the gold reserves even more important than before .
The Bundesbank is the world 's second - largest holder of gold after the US Federal Reserve , and has sold just 20 tonnes out of total reserves of over 3,000 tonnes in the past five years .
" National gold reserves have a confidence and stability - building function for the single currency in a monetary union , " the Bundesbank said .
China is the elephant in the room and it holds the world 's largest foreign reserves , worth 1.81 trillion U.S. dollars followed by Japan and Russia with 996.7 billion U.S. dollars and 581.6 billion U.S. dollars , respectively .
India is fourth with 295.3 billion U.S. dollars .
China only has some 1 % of it 's reserves in gold whereas Germany 's Bundesbank , the world 's second - largest official holder of gold with 3417.4 tons , has 66.3 % of its reserves in gold .
Even a small increase in central bank diversification into gold is likely to see markedly higher prices in the coming years .

Hedge funds executives have told CNBC that several Wall Street firms are marketing a new hedging product that would allow them to " short " stocks — even those on the banned short sale list .
The new " product " is being pitched to major hedge funds today to gauge their interest — it 's unclear if any funds have agreed to implement it .
But the move is controversial : Wall Street firms were behind the SEC 's latest move to ban short - selling .
Morgan Stanley CEO
John
Mack told employees that short sellers spreading false rumors tanked the firm 's stock last week .
Morgan Stanley was later forced to convert itself into a bank .
Citigroup officials have been among those pitching the new shorting technique — which involves the use of derivatives .
An official there who spoke on condition on anonymity said the technique is still in the discussion stages , adding that if it is rolled out , it will be used purely for hedging purposes .
Hedge funds will not be able to use the technique to create a " net short " position .
Rather , the technique will be used to hedge against potential losses from going long on a financial stock on the banned list
The Citigroup official said other firms are pitching similar trades .
Spokespeople from the firm had no immediate comment .
Still , hedge fund managers interviewed by CNBC say the move is hypocritcal and easily abused .
Some Wall Street firms pitching the idea called it a " loophole " in the SEC 's short - selling ban .
It 's unclear if the firms rolling out the trade have consulted with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Music legend David Bowie was arrested in upstate New York in March 1976 on a felony pot possession charge .
The Thin White Duke , 29 at the time , was nabbed along with Iggy Pop and two other codefendants at a Rochester hotel following a concert .
Bowie was held in the Monroe County jail for a few hours before being released .
The above Rochester Police Department mug shot was taken three days after Bowie 's arrest , when the performer appeared at City Court for arraignment .
We have already soared to newer heights with our list of luxurious aircraft interiors .
Now it ’s time to descend and submerge in an array of luxurious water vehicles that can take you close to the ocean floor .
Care to glide along with the seals , dolphins or sea turtles or dare to tease a shark or chase a whale ?
Pushing aside the swanky yachts and sizeable boats , luxurious submarine are making waves in the world of the Rich and Famous .
Allowing you to explore the abyssal world of marvelous depths , these underwater vehicles can take you deeper than you can imagine .
Here is a list of submarines that will transport you to the spectacular , unfathomable ocean realm .
12 ) Stylish Personal Submersible Concepts

The XS100 Trio Alpha has room for three people , while the XS100 Duo Beta and XS100 Duo Delta can accommodate two .
11 ) AQUA submersible watercraft
Creations like the AQUA submersible watercraft designed by Sungchul Yang and Woonghee Han from the University of Seoul would be indispensable commuters capable of sizzling on and under the water .
Winning the IDEA design award for 2008 , this submersible is a one - manned watercraft developed for the times ahead .
Its dolphin - like shape would make it easier to trounce the waters .
The design theoretically is a consequence of apt study pertaining to buoyancy control , oxygen supply and driver protection from the unrelenting water pressure .
The Rinspeed sQuba concept car looks to be inspired by James Bond ’s Lotus Esprit , which could transform into a submarine .
Amphibious vehicles are not a new concept , but what makes sQuba stand out is the fact that this car has the capacity of diving to a depth of about 33 feet .
The world ’s first real diving car with zero emission power is powered by an electric motor when it ’s on land and once in water , the propulsion is provided by two propellers and a pair of jet drives at the push of a button .
The passengers get the oxygen from a self - contained on - board air system .
Manufactured by U - Boat Worx , the C - Quester submersibles are available in two forms , the single - occupant CQ1 and the two - man CQ2 .
The C - Quester can dive in all waters , regardless of depth , and it can dive to a maximum depth of 150 ft .
The C - Quester can remain submerged on a full charge for 2.5 hours and it takes 12 hours to recharge .
EXOMOS engineering has introduced a range of spy- inspired submarines designed by Herev Jaubert , which are designed for a range of applications , from personal use to military purposes .
The Exomos submarines are designed in a variety of configurations for one or more people to use .
7 ) Innespace Sea Breacher Dolphin Watercraft
The Innespace Sea Breacher is a two - seat version of the Bionic Dolphin .
It uses the aircraft canopy from an F - 22 Raptor to provide a panoramic view for both the pilot and passenger .
There are even two smaller view ports in the floor , near the pilot ’s foot controls , for increased visibility and a camera pod mounted on the snorkel that relays images of the surface to a video screen positioned in the dash .
The hull of this upgraded submersible features a large snorkel , disguised as a fin , which allows for deeper dives and greater air flow capacity .
Powered by an Atkins 13B rotary marine conversion engine , it delivers a maximum speed of 175 horsepower .
No details on the pricing , however .
6 ) SEAmagine Ocean Pearl
The Ocean Pearl submersible represents the latest state of the art technology for underwater exploration specifically designed for luxurious submerging .
This two - person transparent submersible has a depth rating of 500 feet ( 153 m ) and its transparent spherical cabin offers an unprecedented panoramic view to its occupants .
The cabin opens as a clam shell and allows for easy entry and exit for the occupants .
The sealed cabin is equipped with a full life support system where scrubbers remove the carbon dioxide , oxygen is replenished at a controlled flow , and the environment is monitored by various analyzers .
The vessel is always positively buoyant , so should all propulsion stop , the craft will gently rise back to the surface on its own .

At about $ 1.69 million , Triton 1000 may be a little too heavy on the pockets , but you can do what no other yacht owner can do , view corals and the amazing underwater life or just have a romantic sub ride with your partner .
3 ) Deep Flight Super Falcon
The two - person Deep Flight Super Falcon is a sleek , battery - powered sub with wings akin to a fighter jet .
Designed to literally fly , as opposed to sink , through the world ’s oceans , Super Falcon uses wings to dive when pushed through the water with 500 pounds of thrust .
The brave will be happy to know it can surface vertically , like a rocket at launch .
To go deeper , you push the joystick control forward , the nose angles down , and the craft descends .
Powered to dive at 320 fpm and climb at 600 fpm , this deep - sea bird is estimated at $ 2 million - plus .

Samples of the male Y - chromosome were collected from 1,330 men now living at six sites known to have been settled in antiquity as colonies and trading outposts of the Phoenicians .
The sites were in Cyprus , Malta , Morocco , the West Bank , Syria and Tunisia .
Each participant , whose inner cheek was swabbed for the samples , had at least three generations of indigenous ancestry at the site .
To this was added data already available from Lebanon and previously published chromosome findings from nearly 6,000 men at 56 sites throughout the Mediterranean region .
The data were then compared with similar research from neighboring communities having no link to Phoenician settlers .
From the research emerged a distinctive Phoenician genetic signature , in contrast to genetic traces spread by other migrations , like those of late Stone - Age farmers , Greek colonists and the Jewish Diaspora .
The scientists thus concluded that , for example , one boy in each school class from Cyprus to Tunis may be a descendant of Phoenician traders .
“ We were lucky in one respect , ” Pierre A. Zalloua , a geneticist at Lebanese American University in Beirut who was a principal author of the journal report , said in an interview .
“ So many Phoenician settlement sites were geographically close to non-Phoenician sites , making it easier to distinguish differences in genetic patterns . ”
In the journal article , the researchers wrote that the work “ underscores the effectiveness of Y - chromosomal variability ” in tracing human migrations .
“ Our methodology , ” they concluded , “ can be applied to any historically documented expansion in which contact and noncontact sites can be identified . ”
Dr. Zalloua said that with further research it might be possible to refine genetic patterns to reveal phases of the Phoenician expansion over time — “ first to Cyprus , then Malta and Africa , all the way to Spain . ”
Perhaps , he added , the genes may hold clues to which Phoenician cities — Byblos , Tyre or Sidon — settled certain colonies .
Dr. Wells , a specialist in applying genetics to migration studies who is also an explorer - in - residence at the National Geographic Society , suggested that similar projects in the future could investigate the genetic imprint from the Celtic expansion across the European continent , the Inca through South America , Alexander ’s march through central and south Asia and multicultural traffic on the Silk Road .

This is one of those moments when the unexpected comes out of nowhere .
Of all places FOX & Friends announced to Sen. McCain that Sen , Obama had led the way on asking to increase the FDIC program up to 250 K and what was HE going to do .... And it gets better ....
Download Download
Q : Barack Obama already has a proposal to revive negotiations .
He wants to increase the amount of money guaranteed by the FDIC of 100 to 250K .
What would Sen , John McCain do ?
Well let 's ask him .
Sen. McCain , your serve .
Barack Obama has made a bold move .
( Silence and blinking from McCain ) McCain : Uh , I , I uhhh talked with the President this morning ....
He looked like he was not prepared for that .
And then he was forced to admit that he did not save the day when he suspended his campaign last Thursday and went to DC to whip the Republicans to vote for the bail out .
He was supposed to be the savior .
Q : So Senator are you saying that you went back to get more Republicans on board so then you are in favor of voting yes yesterday .
And in essence then going back ...
McCain : Oh , Absolutely .
Q : OK , well then going back last week --- did not change enough Republicans minds .
McCain : No , it did n't change enough Republican minds .
We 're going to have to change enough Republican and Democrats minds ...
So McCain is not in control of his party .
I guess Newt Gingrich really is running things over there .
NBC ’s Andrea Mitchell reported this morning that conservatives may have been taking their marching orders from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who “ was whipping against this up until the last minute ” — despite issuing a statement supporting the bill as the vote was taking place ... read on
That 's very scary for a number of reasons ...
There 's been a huge spike in the production of zombie movies lately , and many of them seem to be inspired by war .
Everything from 28 Days Later to Zombie Strippers make explicit reference to wartime , as did seminal 1968 zombie flick Night of the Living Dead .
Is there really a connection between zombie movies and social unrest ?
We decided to do some research and find out .
Advertisement
The result ?
We 've got a line graph showing the number of zombie movies coming out in the West each year since 1910 — and there are definite spikes during certain years , which always seem to happen eerily close to historical events involving war or social upheaval .
Mostly we 've focused on movies from the U.S. and Europe , and we 've included the living dead among zombies — so mummies are included , but vampires and ghosts are n't .
Obviously as you look at this chart , you have to correct somewhat for the fact that more movies are being made as we get closer to the present , and ( more importantly ) there are better records of those movies with better tagging .
So it 's easier to research movies with zombies in them if you 're looking at productions from the 1980s onward .
In addition , there 's been a huge boom in indie and low - budget horror movies over the past ten years , and that undoubtedly accounts somewhat for the giant spike you see during the last 8 years or so .

Still , even correcting for the fact that there are more movies being made today , you can see that there are distinctive spikes in zombie popularity - and they always seem to fall slightly after a huge political or social event has caused mass fear , chaos , or suffering .
That 's why World War II , Vietnam , and the current Iraq War are all followed by a zombie rush at theaters .
Obviously , if you 're going to look at these historical correlations , you have to consider that movies inspired by a real - life event are n't going to show up in theaters for at least six months to a year , so we 've accounted for that .
You can see that most of these spikes in zombie popularity do seem weirdly close to periods of historical trauma like wars or the AIDS epidemic .
Is there a causal connection , or is it just coincidence ?
You be the judge .

By using kangaroo fossils as archaeological biosensors , scientists could help solve one of Australia 's enduring mysteries .
Aborigines arrived 45,000 years ago , spreading across the continent with startling rapidity .
Then , in anthropological terms , they cooled their heels for the next 40,000 years : no significant population expansion .
No fundamental changes in lifestyle .
That changed 5,000 years ago .
Populations shot up .
Settlements increased in number , and their inhabitants grew more sedentary .
Scientists can't explain it .
" What 's going on ?
Why change then ?
There 's no obvious environmental or ecological correlate .
There 's no climate change , " said Doug Bird , a Stanford University anthropologist who 's helped devise an ingenious investigative workaround : kangaroo fossil analysis .
Bird 's team recently published a study on " fire stick farming , " a traditional method of ecosystem management still used by aborigines in Australia 's Western Desert .
Burning old - growth spinifex grass makes it easier to hunt lizards ; cookpot - friendly kangaroos and emus fatten themselves on grasses flourishing on newly cleared lands .
Fire stick farming is too small - scale and subtle to leave behind the sort of landmarks that have made prehistoric terraforming relatively easy to spot elsewhere , said Bird , and charcoal deposits will be too mixed to interpret .
But human - directed changes in foliage should leave telltale traces in the bones of kangaroos , which have small , stable home ranges and versatile dietary habits .
" If you get a shift from woody - like vegetation to grasses , it should be indicated in the shift of stable isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen " in kangaroo bones , said Bird .
Combine that analysis with carbon - 14 dating , said Bird , and researchers could make a time - and - space map of aboriginal settlement and migration .
This could help scientists figure out what caused such massive upheavals in a culture that had been stable for 40,000 years .
Bird cautioned that the method is still experimental .
His team is now calibrating the methodology by analyzing kangaroo fossils from recent burn sites .
" It 's completely untested .
It might not work , " he said .
" But if it does , that 'd be cool . "

During and immediately after the Annapolis meetings to discuss peace , Israel abducted the student president of Beir Zeit University for dissent , launched over 50 attacks on Gaza killing and wounding over 50 Palestinian civilians , police and militia
 The most important thing ( sic ) that should be said about Bush is that had I told him that I was opposed to this move ( Annapolis meeting ) , he wouldnt have embarked on it .
I could have blocked the move .
Had I been unwilling to co-operate with him , Bush wouldnt have coerced me .
I spoke to the President with unparalleled sharpness about these matters ( bombing Irans nuclear facilities ) and my comments were extremely well received  regarding the freedom ( to bomb Iran ) we are reserving for ourselves and what we will and wont do . ”
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Haaretz November 29 , 2007 .
Introduction
During and immediately after the Annapolis meetings to discuss peace , Israel abducted the student president of Beir Zeit University for dissent , launched over 50 attacks on Gaza killing and wounding over 50 Palestinian civilians , police and militia , set in motion a vast building project of 250 new apartments in Palestinian East Jerusalem , projected permanent Israeli military posts in the West Bank , rejected any time limits or specific goals in their negotiations with the PLO and launched a virulent dismissal of the major US intelligence report ( National Intelligence Estimate ) on the non-existence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program .
Israels presence at Annapolis had absolutely nothing to do with peace or promises to negotiate in good faith :
Their purpose was to deflect attention from their meat - grinder style genocidal policies in Gaza and their relentless drive to savagely dispossess all Palestinians of any territory or semblance of autonomy , literally turning off the lights ( energy ) , gas and water to 1.4 million Palestinians residing in Gaza .
Since September 11 , 2001 the Israeli state , Zionists inside the US government and the entire leadership of the Major American Jewish Organizations have been entirely devoted to pushing the US into Middle East wars on behalf of Israel .
In the run-up to the Iraq War , Zionists in top strategic decision - making positions in the Pentagon , the Vice Presidents Office , the White House and the National Security Council designed and executed war policy , fabricated evidence , wrote Presidential speeches , organized press conferences and presidential agendas , purged critics in the military and intelligence agencies and altered intelligence reports to suit their purposes .
Israeli and Zion - Con success in destroying Iraq however was secured at an enormous cost in US military casualties , demoralization and one trillion dollars ( and counting ) in cost to the US taxpayers .
As a result , public opinion dramatically shifted against the war , despite the intervention of the Israeli regime in shaping US public opinion via its army of  Israel - First academic and journalistic scribes and propagandists with broad access to the US mass media .
As I pointed out in an earlier article , the devastating effects , which the Israeli - Zioncon - promoted Iraq War has had on the US military , and intelligence agencies , led to widespread opposition within the US state to the Israeli - Zionist push for mounting a new war against Iran .
This historic struggle over Iran policy split the top echelons of the Washington policy making .
On the one hand , the Israeli Firsters controlled or influenced the White House , the majority of Congress and key Congressional committee chairpersons , the financing of both major political parties , the leading presidential candidates and the bulk of the mass media .
The opposition was led by senior active and retired military officers , backed by the great majority of middle level officers and ground troops , especially the reserves .
The entire range of top intelligence officials were disgusted by the  Israel Firsters  in the Pentagon because of their distortion of their previous reports and fabrication of intelligence 
via newly invented agencies and their reliance on Israeli disinformation over US intelligence .
This monumental struggle within the government was not merely about US military policy toward Iran ( which is crucial ) but also about who rules the US , who commands the US military and who formulates intelligence reports that inform policy , and more basically whose interests are being served .
The military command in the Middle East , led by Admiral William Fallon , came out publicly opposing the Israeli - Fifth Column policy to bomb Iran .
The active commanders were meekly backed by the rubber - spined Defense Secretary , Robert Gates , and surreptitiously ( at first ) by the top intelligence chiefs .
The Zion - Cons retaliated by launching the White House and Congress in a crusade to escalate economic sanctions and to keep the military option on the table .
Every major Israel - First academic and propaganda think tank followed up the Israeli war planning with a wave of op - ed articles and interviews throughout the mass media about Irans immediate nuclear threat .
The President , who does nothing contrary to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ( as trumpeted by Olmert himself ) , pronounced an apocalyptic message to the world in October 2007 ( six weeks before the National Intelligence Estimate was finally released ) proclaiming the advent of  World War Three against Irans nuclear weapons program and the threat of a nuclear attack ( a holocaust ) by Iran against the people of the US and Israel .
The White House was privy to the findings in the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iran at least 9 months before they were made public , as witnessed by President Cheneys frequent interventions to alter their content and conclusion and repeated efforts to postpone their publication because it undermined the basis for their push to attack Iran .
The Israeli government and its US Fifth Column , well aware of the forthcoming publication of the findings of sixteen top US intelligence agencies , did everything in their power to precipitate a US war with Iran , from issuing hair - raising tales of the existential threats to Israels survival to encouraging , rousing bellicose speeches by AIPAC , Zionist and Jewish community leaders .
Israel went to war with Irans ally ( Hezbollah ) in Lebanon , bombed Syria which has a mutual security pact with Iran , escalated Israeli - trained Kurdish terrorist attacks across the Iranian border in order to provoke Iranian retaliation  to no avail .
AIPAC and its Congressional allies led by Israeli - US Senator Lieberman pulled all stops to force a conflict , increasing sanctions against bankers and corporations dealing with Iran and even labeling the Iranian military special force , the  Republican Guards  as an illegal terrorist organization  and thus an automatic target of US military attacks under the doctrine of the  War against Terror .
The hyper-activity , the vicious military attacks , the strident rhetoric against all critics of the military option , and the urgency , with which the Israelis and their US supporters acted , was not due to any imminent Iranian nuclear threat but a desperate effort to precipitate the war before the US NIE became public and undermined their entire war propaganda campaign and military preparations for an attack .
The NIE findings temporarilyclosed the book on the White House - Israeli - Zionist Big Lie that Iran was engaged in developing weapons to launch a nuclear war .
The NIE report refuted its own previous conclusions of 2005 , which were heavily influenced by the White House and its Zionist - Israeli backers .
The reversal of conclusions was not based on new data or information techniques as is claimed .
The change resulted from a dramatic shift in the balance of forces within the US government and in particular the strengthening of the US military elite versus the pro-war Zionist Power Configuration , a shift shaped by the enormous and unending American losses in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A key factor in pushing the US intelligence agencies to break with their past subjugation to White House manipulation and Israeli - Zionist fabricated intelligence was the repeated failures and incredible stupidity of the Israeli intelligence agencies  leading to a loss of their credibility .
Israeli intelligence blundered and miscalculated on Hezbollahs strength and organization which led to a debacle when Israel invaded Lebanon in the summer of 2006 .
Israeli estimates on Iraqi capacity to resist invasion and foreign occupation ( so eagerly accepted and propagated by top Zionist Pentagon officials in the lead up to the invasion ) led to the now 6 years of a US war of attrition in Iraq with no end in sight .
Israels intelligence totally underestimated Hamas electoral strength in the run-up to their electoral victory over the PLO .
Israeli intelligence overestimated the PLOs military capacity to defeat and destroy Hamas in Gaza .
Israels claim to have detected a nuclear facility in Syria , which it bombed , was an international joke  as even Moses could not have destroyed a ( fictional ) nuclear facility without producing a speck of radioactive dust !
Learning from Israeli intelligence agencies  tendency to feed disinformation to its clients in the US Government in order to further Greater Israels claims to Mid-East hegemony at the expense of Washingtons long term interests , the US national intelligence community asserted its independence and published its report denying each and every Israeli - Zionist - White House assertion concerning Irans nuclear weapons program and , in particular , pointing to the end of research into nuclear weapons as far back as the fall of 2003 .
Israel Rejects the US NIE
While governments , the United Nations and experts around the world recognized the rigorous , systematic , comprehensive methods used to compile the data leading to the report declaring that Iran was free of nuclear weapons programs , one and only one state objected : The Jewish State of Israel .
And in the USA only one nationwide configuration of organizations refused to reconcile itself to the absence of any Iranian military threat to Israel ( not to speak of the US , a distant secondary consideration ) and that was predictably the Zionist Power Configuration , specifically the Presidents of the Major American Jewish Organizations .
Speaking for the Israeli Government , Defense Minister Ehud Barak , with the predictable arrogance and contempt that Israeli officials treat any US policy analysis or statement that doesnt pass their editorial approval and toe their line , dismissed the NIE :
 We can not allow ourselves to rest just because of an intelligence report from the other side of the earth ( sic ) even from our greatest friend .
( Guardian of London , December 4 , 2007 ) .
Though the NIE may weaken the White House drive to war , the fact that Israel rejects the report means that its war preparations will continue and that means that its entire Zionist Power Configuration in the US will continue to pursue Israels interest in destroying Iran .
Following Orwellian logic AIPAC twisted the NIE report to fit Israels rejectionist lead ( as it never fails to do ) by arguing that the NIE report bolsters the case for continued confrontation , belligerency and isolation ( Jewish Telegraph Agency , December 4 , 2007 ) .
In fact according to the perverse argument of AIPAC spokesman Josh Block , the absence of any Iranian nuclear weapons threat should result in greater pressure on Iran !
 All in all , its ( the NIE ) a clarion call for additional and continued ( my emphasis ) effort to pressure Iran economically and politically to end its illicit nuclear program .
( Jewish Telegraph Agency , December 4 , 2007 ) .
Once again the Israel Firsters  embracing all the major Zionist organizations and community councils  defy all logic , and the most comprehensive and in depth empirical intelligence report of the US in favor of the propaganda emanating from the failed Israeli intelligence agencies and the Israeli regime .
In a continuous barrage of articles and television interviews , the entire Zionist Power Configuration ( ZPC ) buried the NIE report , refocusing attention on themes like  Irans nuclear program still a threat  ( Daily Alert , December 7 , 2007 ) .
During the entire week ( December 3 - 7 , 2007 ) the Presidents of the Major American ( sic ) Jewish Organizations  covering the entire range of financially powerful Jewish organizations in the USA  published an average of nine articles ( nearly 50 ) propagating the Israeli line .
The articles disparaged , distorted and dismissed the NIE and continued to push for the military option ( euphemism for launching a massive attack on Iran ) as well as new economic sanctions to destroy the Iranian economy and the livelihood of its 70 million citizens .
The euphoria of anti-war critics who claim the NIE report laid to rest the threat of a new US war with Iran is premature , as is their idea that the  Israel Lobby  was dealt a decisive blow .
The ZPC never lost a beat : Israel Firster and Zion - Con fanatic , US Treasury Undersecretary , responsible for terrorism and financial intelligence , Stuart Levey , succeeded in convincing China to tighten trade credit , making trade more difficult and costly for Irans private sector .
( Financial Times , December 6 , 2007 , p. 1 ) .
Internationally , the United Kingdoms Foreign Secretary David Millband  a long - time supporter of Israel with close family ties to the Zionist state  predictably followed the Bush - Israel - ZPC line in all but dismissing the NIE report and emphasizing the need to keep the pressure on Iran .
Millband , who on his recent visit to Israel , refused to even pass a glance at Israels shutdown of electricity and fuel to the 1.4 million Palestinians caged up in Gaza , spent an entire evening exchanging pleasantries with his settler relatives in Tel Aviv .
He accused the non-nuclear Iran of being a major threat to the international community because it produces what he called fissile material and missiles .
Every large and medium size country in the world produces enriched uranium and possesses missiles ; to impose a sinister construction on Irans civilian and defense projects is laughable .
( Financial Times , December 6 , 2007 ) Millband dismisses out of hand their civilian application and parrots word for word his Israeli mentors  line about hidden programs  and other such unsubstantiated Zionist propaganda .
Recent revelations of large - scale , long - term Zionist financing of the highly indebted Labor Partys electoral campaigns by millionaire moguls and self - proclaimed  Labor Friends of Israel ( Independent , December 6 2007 ) suggests that Millbands rapid rise to head the Foreign Ministry had less to do with his minimal international affairs experience and more to do with the special relations  between millionaire Zionist fundraisers and past and present Labor Party leaders , Tony Blair and Gordon Brown .
In France President Sarkozy appointed Zionist zealot Bernard Kouchner , ( a fervent supporter of humanitarian intervention including the US invasion of Iraq ) , to head the Foreign Ministry after consultations  with leading French Jewish organizations , which had rejected an earlier candidate , deemed not pro-Israel enough .
Bernie Kouchner and Nicky Sarkozy immediately picked up the Israeli line , dismissing the NIE Report and calling for new economic sanctions even as the original justification ( Irans so - called nuclear weapons program ) was found to be a lie .
Nicky and Bernie called for a new UN National Security Council resolution adding greater sanctions against Iran ( AFP , December 7 , 2007 ) .
The Bush - Millband - Kouchner - Israeli logic parallels Stalinist - Nazi logic — the more the intelligence reports demonstrate the absence of a nuclear weapons program , the greater the nuclear threat ; the lesser the present threat , the greater the future threat ; the lesser the empirically verifiable threat , the greater the secret threat .
The NIE report made liars of the White House and Congressional Democrats and the Presidents of the Major American Jewish Organizations who knew  Iran had a nuclear weapons program .
Even more revealingly , it demonstrates that for the same war mongers , Iranian nuclear weapons is not the motivating force for their drive to attack Iran .
Leaving out the weapons motive , it is abundantly clear that attacking Iran through sanctions and military threats is deeply rooted in the Israeli priority of destroying Iran as an adversary to its Middle East power grab and its assault and territorial dispossession of Palestinians .
The ZPC , Millband , Kouchner , Olmert , and the White Houses efforts to push for a third round of UN sanctions is likely to be rejected .
On December 4 , Chinas UN Ambassador , Wang Guangya , announced that the NIE report called into question the need for new sanctions ,  I think we all start from the presumption that now things have changed .
I think council members will have to consider that .
( Al Jazeera , December 5 , 2007 ) .
China , with $ 17 billion dollars in direct trade with Iran and up to $ 30 billion via Dubai , and with Iran as a major Middle East oil supplier and with no Zionist lobby to reinforce Israeli diplomatic pressures , is free to pursue its own national interests .
The case can be made that Russia , under President Vladimir Putin , will follow Chinas lead and object to new sanctions .
Nevertheless , the US Congress and in particular its influential Committee chairpersons continue to blindly follow Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmerts pronouncement post - NIE :
 It is vital to pursue efforts to prevent Iran from developing a capability like this ( sic ) in the United States .
Leading Congressional Israeli -American zealot , Thomas Lantos , convoked a congressional hearing on the NIE Report and invited two top ex-government advisers and ultra-Zion zealots , David Wurmser and Martin Indyk to testify .
Conclusion
There is no question that the anti-( Iran ) war groups in the US military and intelligence agencies struck a serious blow to the ongoing war plans of the White House , Israel and their agents in the ZPC .
The setback includes a temporary defeat of its massive war propaganda and their fabrication of an existential threat to the world community ( Israel )  .
Nevertheless the publication of the NIE hit the headlines for only a few days , followed by a barrage of hostile propaganda in all of the US mass media which called into question the peaceful intentions of Iran and even twisted certain probabilistic phrases to contradict the main findings .
From the vantage point of Americans trying to free their government and the American public of Israeli and ZPC tyrannical monopoly of opinion , the NIE Report struck a blow against the credibility of the White House and Zionist spokespeople in the Congress , National Security Council , Homeland Security and the Justice and Treasury Departments regarding Irans so - called nuclear weapons program .
But the quickness , depth and scope of the Israeli response especially magnified by its representatives in the US , the French and British foreign offices , demonstrates that the pro-war Israel Firsters are still deeply embedded in positions of political power and willing to defy the US intelligence and military establishment .
Without shame or substance , with aggressive outbursts and manipulative semantical skills , the ZPC moves forward toward new sanctions , despite the systematic empirical refutation of its principle argument .
Only a blind , irrational tribal - ethnic loyalty to Israel can account for the ready denial of the NIE report and automatic embrace of Israels continued fabrications .
As in the thirties when overseas Nazi sympathizers defended Hitlers lies about Communists torching the Reichstag and Communist fellow travelers defended Stalins purges as exemplary judicial processes , our Zionists continue to deny every systematic empirical report ( like the NIE ) which contradicts Israels lies and fabrications about Irans nuclear weapons programs .
Beyond the important issue of dual loyalties ( very much in evidence in the ZPCs response to the NIE report ) there is the re-emergence of the question of a US - backed Israeli war with Iran .
The military option will be buttressed by an Israeli military intelligence propaganda report dismissing the NIE .
It will claim secret Iranian nuclear weapons programs buried somewhere near the center of the earth and therefore undetected by US intelligence informants , satellite photos , UN inspectors , defecting ( or kidnapped ) Iranian Generals or any other US source .
Only Israels superior intelligence agencies ( which failed in Lebanon , Iraq and the Gaza Strip ) , based on its Chosen People ( with their unassailable intelligence hot - line to the  Omniscient One  the same  One who does the  Choosing ) can be right  even if they have to once again cook the data to make the case to the uninitiated .
The NIE and the US Military have struck a blow against the planners of World War III .
Will this lift the US Congress off its collective knees to finally address US interests in the Middle East ?
Will it re-awaken a currently moribund peace movement , terrified to confront the most virulent organized warmongers ?
Will it allow Congress and the US public to challenge the ZPCs stranglehold on US - Middle East policy ?
Will the British public and peace movement dare to challenge a Labor Government and Foreign Office bought and paid for by the  Labor Friends of Israel ?
Will the French public and intellectuals of Paris recover their republican credentials and reject its first and foremost Israel First regime ?
Two weeks after the Annapolis Meeting , Israeli Housing Minister Zeev Boim gave US Secretary of State Condeleeza Rice the bristly cucumber ( a Mediterranean style slap in the face ) when she pleaded with the Jewish state to stop building new settlements in Palestinian East Jerusalem because , it doesnt help to build confidence .
Boim went on to say ,  Secretary of State Rice should be congratulated for her efforts in re-launching the peace process ( sic ) but this cannot be constantly linked to the cessation of construction in Jerusalem
There is thus nothing to prevent construction anywhere else in Israel . 
( Al Jazeera , December 8 , 2007 ) .
Just as the Jewish state can dismiss its vague promises to the Bush regime on the so - called peace process  in short order , so does Israel reject the NIE report on the absence of a nuclear weapon program in Iran and prepare for war  backed by the entire ZPC .
Surprisingly it is not liberal or leftist opinion leaders who have raised the relevant issues pertaining to the questions of war and peace in the Middle East , the Israeli - White House threats of starting World War III .
It is the spy agencies in the US and their allies in the US military , the paragons of past wars and present destabilization campaigns ( read  Venezuela ) .
It is an irony of history .
But just the same , this is the real world in which we live , where Western intellectuals and cultural heroes have abdicated their responsibility to challenge the Zionist Power Configuration operating on behalf of an aspiring Middle East colonial power .

There are more than 8.5 m songs on iTunes store A veiled threat by Apple to close its iTunes store has emerged 18 months after it was issued and just a day before royalty rates are to be set .
The Copyright Royalty Board meets on Thursday to rule on a requested 66 % increase for sales of digital music from 9 cents to 15 cents a track .
A rise would have to be paid by either Apple , the record company or consumer .
Apple opposed the rate hike and has said it is unwilling to raise its 99 cents a song price or absorb a rise .
In April 2007 the company 's vice president for iTunes , Eddy Cue , submitted testimony to the Board at the Library of Congress .
" If iTS ( iTunes Store ) were forced to absorb any increase in the mechanical royalty rates , the result would be to significantly increase the likelihood of the store operating at a financial loss - which is no alternative at all .
" Apple has repeatedly made clear that it is in this business to make money , and would most likely not continue to operate iTS if it were no longer possible to do so profitably , " said Mr Cue . The National Music Publishers '
Association has asked for the royalty rate increase and has said it believes everyone will benefit because the digital music market is growing .
" I think we established a case for an increase in the royalties , " said David Israelite , president of the NMPA .
" Apple may want to sell songs cheaply to sell iPods .
We do n't make a penny on the sale of an iPod . "
The Recording Industry Association of America said sales of digital songs and albums rose 46 % last year to $ 1.2bn ( £ 652 m ) .
" Public backlash " Apple pays an estimated 70 % of digital music revenue to record companies which in turn pass on a percentage to artists .
It is that percentage that is expected to be changed on Thursday .
The forthcoming decision by the three judge panel will set rates for the next five years .
It will be the first affecting digital sales .
Meanwhile the Digital Media Association , which represents Apple and other online music services , has asked for the rate to be pegged at 4.8 cents a track .
With CD sales falling last year by 20 % to $ 7.4bn ( £ 4bn ) , record companies are unlikely to be willing to soak up any increase in rates .
Greg Sandoval at CNET said the timing of the emergence of the Apple document is interesting .
" When it comes down to mass appeal , Apple holds all the cards . "
If word gets out that music publishers are trying to stick it to consumers , and Apple is fighting to keep prices down on their behalf , well , there 's liable to be public backlash against the labels .
" If this thing follows the normal course , there would be calls for boycotts , protests and so on . "
Piper Jaffray estimates that Apple will sell 2.4 bn songs this year , giving it an 85 % share of the digital music market .

Not long ago , it seemed music videos were doomed to go the way of the radio star .
Cool bands hated making them , MTV had stopped showing them , and innovative directors like Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry had long since moved on .
Then , somewhere between OK Go's treadmill - dancing " Here It Goes Again " on YouTube ( more than 37 million views ) and Feist 's " 1234 " choreography lesson turned iPod ad , the music video made a comeback — and launched a new generation of directors more at home with URL than TRL .

A week into the European leg of the meltdown of the global financial system , Germany has hit major turbulence .
Hypo Real Estate , a member of the DAX - 30 , Germany ’s equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average looks to be on the verge of failing .
According to the German Magazine Der Spiegel , the planned bailout of the company is unraveling and failure is a looming possibility , as the company faces a potentially massive 70 to 100 billion euro funding gap by 2009 .
The German central bank has warned that if Hypo Real Estate fails , a collapse of similar proportions to the fallout after the Lehman Brothers failure would threaten Germany .
This story should alert readers to the depth of the liquidity problems that exist not only in the U.S. , but in Europe as well .
Below is the translation of Spiegel ’s report of the most recent events .
UPDATE : 5 OCT 2008 700 PM ET : The German government has bailed out Hypo Real Estate with a 50 billion euro rescue package .
Let ’s hope that ends HRE ’s problems .
In the meantime , policy makers can get to work and unfreeze the money markets .
Rescue package for Hypo Real Estate collapses
A surprising twist in the case of Hypo Real Estate : the laboriously negotiated rescue package for the Munich bank has temporarily come undone .
The bank is fighting for its survival , said a spokesman this evening .
The 35 billion euro rescue package for the battered real estate financier , Hypo Real Estate , has failed .
As HRE announced on Saturday evening , the loan commitment by several financial institutions is currently no longer valid .
The group is examining the resulting consequences for the business units of the company .
Alternative solutions are being explored .
Further details have not been made .
Shortly afterward , HRE spokesman Hans Obermeier said , the bank was fighting for its existence .
The bank is obviously in a difficult situation .
He assumes and hopes that all parties involved in the discussions are fully aware of the seriousness of the situation .
As to specific measures that HRE is now investigating , he gave no initial comment .
The major shareholders are prepared to support the bank financially .
HRE spokesman Obermeier did not want to comment Spiegel Online as to reports that the liquidity Gap of the bank could reach 70 to 100 billion euros by the end of 2009 .
He could only confirm that the consortium ’s original aid pledge had been withdrawn .
“ Why , we do not know , ” Obermeier said .
He said there were clear signals from the shareholders and Government , that they wanted to cooperate to find a solution to the problem .
The Finance Ministry was not informed in advance
This evening , the Federal Government pointed to the responsibility banking supervision played .
The government will not take a position just yet , government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm told the AP news agency in Paris .
A spokeswoman for the financial regulators BaFin did not want to comment on the failure of the rescue package .
Sources close to [ Finance ]
Minister Steinbrueck said that the Finance Ministry had not been informed of the changed situation in advance by either Hypo Real Estate or the consortium of banks .
The government was informed only through ad hoc communication with HRE that the rescue package had collapsed .
“ We will now try to pick up the pieces on Sunday , ” the Ministry of Finance said .
The aid plan , agreed to one week ago , foresaw a short - term loan of 15 billion euros and a long - term refinancing of up to 35 billion euros in the second half of 2009 .
“ Die Welt am Sonntag ” had previously reported that Deutsche Bank had found in a study that HRE already clearly needed more money in the short - term .
According to the Deutsche Bank report , the company would lack up to 50 billion euros by the end of the year and even as high as 70 to 100 billion euros by the end of 2009 .
Quick solution necessary
In financial circles , it is expected that on Sunday evening , again at a crisis meeting , a rescue will come for Hypo Real Estate .
According to estimates of experts , stakeholders have little time to forge a new rescue package for HRE : “ If there is no solution when stock markets open on Monday morning , the company wo n’t make it two more days , ” said a banker .
This week , the Bundesbank and the BaFin had labeled the rescue operation which is now collapsing as vital to avoid “ severe disruptions to the financial markets ” .
In a letter from the Bundesbank and BaFin to Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck it was said that otherwise the German financial and economic system would be threatened by “ similar unforeseeable consequences ” as after the collapse of the U.S. financial group Lehman Brothers .
Moreover , in the letter dated Monday , it was said that the bankruptcy of the real estate firm , because of it strong interconnectedness , would have affected a large group of creditors .
Hypo Real Estate got into trouble through liquidity problems at Ireland - based subsidiary Depfa .
For the rescue of the real estate financier , the federal government had prepared a guarantee amounting to 35 billion euros .
However , the latest is that the banks could not agree to their share of 8.5 billion in the package .
The current relief program , for which the federal government and the financial industry are liable , should provide HRE for the coming weeks up to 15 billion euros in additional liquidity .
Der endgültige Notkredit , der danach greifen würde , beläuft sich auf 35 Milliarden Euro .
The final emergency credit , which would be available to draw down afterward , amounts to 35 billion euros .
Back in the mid-1990 ’s I worked as a consultant for Hypo Real Estate ’s precursor Bayerische Vereinsbank .
It was Germany ’s fifth largest bank by assets .
They were looking to fix their retail lending operations and had hired the consulting firm I worked for to do a Credit Reeningineering Project .
My role was to develop a schema to rationalize the retail lending process and procedures .
Later the bank merged with crosstown rival Hypobank , only to find out the combined organization had massive real estate losses from speculation in the former East Germany .
Seeing the turmoil at the company , I dug out my final presentation to the company : “ Massenkreditprozesse : Ueberblick und Quantifizierung ” ( Retail Credit Processes : Overview and Quantification ) – a real page turner .
Very nice people and good memories of Munich .

The 4 November election will settle more than who sits in the White House .
Bill Clinton ( left ) and Al Taubman back Michigan 's Proposal 2 . C. Osorio/ AP
Last year Sean Morrison , a stem - cell scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , received an e-mail from a woman wanting to donate extra embryos from her in vitro fertilization procedure towards his research into Parkinson 's disease .
He had to say no .
According to Michigan law , the woman could donate the embryos to another state or throw them away — but not give them to a local researcher to derive new stem - cell lines .
Michigan 's scientific reputation could change on 4 November .
Voters will not only choose the next US president ( see Nature 455 , 442–453 ; 2008 ) but also say yes or no to a state ballot measure on stem - cell research , known as Proposal 2 — one of several initiatives across the country ( see map ) .
If passed , the proposal would amend a 1978 state law banning research on live human embryos , which currently prevents Michigan researchers from deriving new human embryonic stem - cell lines , and which they see as limiting their research .
The initiative would also mean that , instead of having to discard embryos left over from fertility treatment , women could legally donate them directly to state stem - cell research centres .
The state 's ban on using somatic - cell nuclear transfer to produce a human embryo would still hold , and buying and selling human embryos would also become illegal .
Supporters of the initiative had first tried to work within the state legislature to change what they see as overly restrictive laws .
But the bills never got out of committee , says Chris De Witt , spokesman for CureMichigan , the group that sponsors Proposal 2 .
Proponents tried to get a similar initiative on a ballot in 2006 , but failed to collect the necessary number of signatures .
It 's not clear whether the political tides have turned in the initiative 's favour this year ; a recent poll by a local newspaper and tele­vision stations showed a roughly equal split between those who would vote for the measure and those who would not .
It has , however , attracted high - profile supporters such as Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm , billionaire Al Taubman and former president Bill Clinton .
Opponents cite the destruction of human embryos as a reason to vote against the measure .
Some groups are specifically worried about part D of the state ballot proposal , which declares it would " prohibit state and local laws that prevent , restrict or discourage stem - cell research , future therapies and cures " .
That , in essence , would allow future stem - cell research in the state to go unregulated , argues state senator Tom George ( Republican ) , who co-chairs the opposition group , Michigan Citizens Against Unrestricted Science and Experimentation .
That 's simply not true , counters De Witt .
He notes that state institutions that conduct human embryonic stem - cell research have internal ethics review boards to monitor the studies , and that researchers must also follow federal regulations regarding investigations into humans and human tissue .
The same constraints would hold , he says , if researchers were allowed to derive their own lines .
“ We are already at a disadvantage in recruiting faculty who specialize in human embryonic stem - cell research . ”
The initiative has " major significance " because presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama have both hinted that , if elected , they would loosen federal restrictions on embryonic stem - cell research , says Stephen Rapundalo , executive director of MichBio in Ann Arbor , a non-profit organization trying to drive growth of the life - sciences industry in the state .
Currently , federal research money can be used for work only on cell lines derived before 9 August 2001 , the date the federal restrictions came into effect .
The University of Michigan uses 11 of these federally approved lines , which were grown using mouse cells and which , they say , are less than ideal for human clinical research .
If federal law changes after the election but state law does not , Rapundalo says , stem - cell scientists in the state will be at a distinct disadvantage .
Many fear that leading researchers will leave Michigan for other states that support the work , such as California and New York .
Sue O'Shea , director of the Michigan Center for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research in Ann Arbor , says she has seen many of her best students leave — especially those who want to work on embryonic rather than adult stem cells .
Morrison agrees .
" We have already been at a disadvantage in recruiting faculty members who specialize in the area of human embryonic stem - cell research , " he says .
" If the proposal does not pass , this will not improve . "
Nevertheless , unlike California 's $ 3 - billion stem - cell agency , which was created through a ballot initiative , the Michigan initiative has no money attached to it .
" So even if it does pass , it wo n't necessarily allow us to develop any new embryonic stem - cell lines , " O'Shea says .
" It will just make life easier knowing we can do it . "

Why am I so hungry after writing one of these columns ?
I have often wondered .
Now comes
an answer .
A study in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine contends that intellectual work — that ’s right , I ’m calling writing this stuff , ya know , intellectual — induces a big increase in caloric intake .
The research had 14 Canadian students do three things at different times : sit and relax ; complete a series of memory and attention tests ; and read and summarize a text .
( It was that last activity that disqualified rodents and U.S. students as study subjects . )
After 45 minutes at each task , the kids were treated to an all - you - can - eat buffet lunch .
Because Canada has a truly advanced code of human - subject research ethics .
Each session of intellectual work required the burning of only three more calories than relaxing did .
But when the students hit the buffet table after the text summation , they took in an additional 203 calories .
And after the memory and attention tests , the subjects consumed another 253 calories .
Blood samples taken before , during and after the activities found that all that thinking causes big fluctuations in glucose and insulin levels .
And because glucose fuels the neurons , a transitory low level in the brain may signal the stomach to get the hands to fill up the mouth , even though the energy actually spent has gone up just a hair .
The researchers note that such “ caloric overcompensation following intellectual work , combined with the fact that we are less physically active when doing intellectual tasks , could contribute to the obesity epidemic . ”
Think about that — unless you ’re on a diet .
Speaking of calories .
The journal Science reports that mathematicians from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , New York University and the Free University of Brussels have figured out a better way to wrap spherical pieces of chocolate .
There ’s a lot of wasted material when wrapping spheres with square pieces of foil or paper .
But our intrepid geometers found that by using equilateral triangles rather than squares , they could generate a savings of 0.1 percent .
That ’s one full square saved for every 1,000 pieces of triangle - wrapped chocolate you eat .
Speaking of the munchies .
Some of the chemical compounds found in marijuana show promise for fighting drug - resistant bacterial infections .
That ’s according to the Journal of Natural Products , published by the American Chemical Society .
( As opposed to The Book of Mr. Natural , published by Fantagraphics Books .
Seriously . )
Naturally , scientists have long known that pot contains antibacterial constituents .
But lack of seed money stems research , so little has been done to investigate pot ’s potential .
In the new study researchers tested five cannabinoid marijuana ingredients against the superbug MRSA , methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
All five did a lot of damage to the bacterium .
And two of the substances do n’t even appear to be psychoactive , meaning they could be turned into medications that do n’t cause a high .
Because the last thing you want to administer to a patient incapacitated for weeks in a hospital bed experiencing the horrors of an out - of - control staph infection is an antibacterial drug that would also lighten his mood .
Speaking of mood - altering .
Earlier this year Republicans in the House of Representatives adopted as a reelection sales pitch the phrase “ The Change You Deserve . ”
Which they apparently did n’t realize was already the trademarked slogan for Effexor XR , a potent antidepressant .
But I digress .
At the Republican National Convention former real senator and fictional New York City district attorney Fred Thompson said of Sarah Palin , “ I think I can say without fear of contradiction she is the only nominee in the history of either party who knows how to properly field - dress a moose .
With the possible exception of Teddy Roosevelt . ”
Be afraid , Fred .
Because I ’m fairly sure that Grant , Lincoln and Andrew Jackson could have dressed a moose .
Not to mention Washington , Zachary Taylor and William Henry Harrison , although they were n’t members of either current political party .
( Bill Clinton could probably undress a moose . )
I ’m also fairly sure that if Teddy Roo­se­velt were alive today , he’d be referred to in some quarters as “ that effete East Coast elitist environmentalist wacko . ”
Speaking of which , I ’m hungry .
Note :
This article was originally printed with the title , " Hungry For Change " .
There is one major problem on Wall Street , that until solved , will result in meltown after meltdown in future years .
I ca n’t say if the meltdown monkey will hit every 2,3 , 5 or 10 years .
But I can say with certainty that it will happen again .
Why ?
Because Risk and Reward have been decoupled for CEOs on Wall Street .
If you are the CEO of a major public company , once you qualify for your golden parachute there is absolutely no reason not to throw the Hail Mary pass , and do high risk deals every chance you get .
If you run a major hedge fund or fund of any kind , once you have put enough cash in the bank to get to your “ F U Money Level ” there is absolutely no reason not to throw the Hail Mary pass and make high risk investments every chance you get .
What is the down side ?
Lets just say for example , you run Fannie May or Freddie Mac .
You basically fuck up the entire housing economy .
Your punishment ?
You walk away with 9 mm and 14 mm dollars as severance .
Would you take either of those jobs ?
Lets say you run Country Wide Insurance .
You get the housing market plumped up , during which you sell $ 414 mm dollars worth of stock , and then watch as it spirals out of control because you lent money to anyone with a pulse , and probably to some without .
Your punishment ?
A $ 110 mm payday .
Oh wait , he had to give some back .
Sucks to be him does n’t it .
Carly Fiorina got fired from HP and walked away with severance pay of $ 42 mm in cash .
Some people thought she was a good CEO .
Some people thought she was horrible and her acquisition of Compaq was the final straw .
Did she care what they thought ?
Why should she ?
She could do what she wanted , she had $ 42 mm big ones waiting for her either way !
The list of CEOs who have walked away with huge severance packages is a long one .
The problem however isnt how much they got paid .
There is zero downside to a CEO for taking chances beyond the embarassment of getting fired .
Would you let someone fire and embarass you for a check for $ 20 mm dollars ?
So would CEOs .
Find me the one story where the headline is “ CEO has to pay the company losses back for being an idiot ? ” or ” Risky moves cost CEO his lifetime savings ” or “ Hedge fund manager gives back bonuses and exits with $ 1500 dollars a month severance ”
It does n’t exist .
Every public company CEO in the country knows it does n’t exist .
Which is exactly why we need to re-establish a link between risk and reward in public companies .
The first step should be the following law :
If the government must step in and provide any sort of financing or guarantees for any part of a public company ’s business , then all officers and directors lose all rights to severance pay and all outstanding vested or unvested options or warrants immediately become canceled .
In the event the CEO of such corporation is not fired , but instead chooses to step down voluntarily , then the last 12 months of earnings is considered to be an interest free loan which the CEO must pay back over no more than a 10 year period .
Honestly , i dont think it would have changed the actions of CEOs who have been bailed out .
They would have thought it “ couldnt happen to them ” .
But once it happened a couple of times to a couple of big company CEOs , it would be in the decision making process of every CEO running a huge financial company .
The 2nd option would be to prevent certain types of companies from being or going public .
Law Firms can;t go public .
Investment firms like Goldman Sachs used to not be able to go public .
They were partnerships .
Partners were paid for the most part in cash .
If the partnership had money to pay , it got paid .
If not , not .
I promise you , their tolerance for risk was far lower than it is today for Goldman because there was a direct link between the risk and reward for partners .
I also guarantee you that if the business makes sense , there will be other companies that step in to handle any business that a partnership cant grow to handle .
And what about the CEOs that just screw up companies , but not to the point of federal bailouts ?
You cant protect against hiring a bad CEO .
It happens .
You can pass a law saying that officers and board members ca n’t be paid in stock .
Let them take their cash earnings and go on the market and buy stock or options like everyone else .
Putting their own cash money on the line will create a link between the risk and the reward .
They will be in the same boat as every other shareholder .
It ’s their money on the line .
Crazy ?
Some people might say that it would make it tougher to find CEOs for big companies .
Companies could n’t pay them enough .
I say thats crazy .
What are those potential CEOs going to do otherwise ?
If the market for CEO pay isnt high enough for them , they can go out and start their own companies and take on the risk .
As long as we pay CEOs with lottery tickets , I mean stock , that they do n’t have to pay for , risk and reward will be decoupled .
As long as that is the case , you can count on many a future bubble and meltdown and there is absolutely nothing anyone can do to stop them .
... that the government cannot protect you and that you should be prepared to do so yourself .

Current polling in the 2008 presidential election shows a very tight race between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain .
In part because of the strong support Obama is attracting among younger voters , and as the number of Americans who are reachable only by cell phones rises , interest continues to grow in the question of whether public opinion polls that do not include cell phones are accurately measuring the relative levels of support for the two candidates .
The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press has conducted three major election surveys with both cell phone and landline samples since the conclusion of the primaries .
In each of the surveys , there were only small , and not statistically significant , differences between presidential horserace estimates based on the combined interviews and estimates based on the landline surveys only .
Yet a virtually identical pattern is seen across all three surveys :
In each case , including cell phone interviews resulted in slightly more support for Obama and slightly less for McCain , a consistent difference of two - to - three points in the margin .
For example , in Pew ’s latest poll , conducted Sept. 9 - 14 with 2,509 registered voters , including 549 reached by cell phone , 46 % backed Obama and 44 % backed McCain .
Among the landline respondents , the candidates were tied at 45 % each .
The same 2 - point differential is seen if the analysis is restricted to likely voters – in this case , the candidates are tied in the combined sample , while McCain has a two - point lead among landline respondents .
Similar differences were seen in August and June .
In August , Obama led by 3 points ( 46 % - 43 % ) in the combined sample of registered voters , while the landline sample showed the race tied at 45 % each .
In June , Obama led by eight points ( 48 % to 40 % ) in the combined sample , and by five points ( 46 % to 41 % ) in the landline sample alone .
In all three cases , the overall horserace differences between the landline and combined samples are not statistically significant , but adhere to the same pattern .
1
As implied by these results , in each of the three polls , the cell - only respondents were significantly more supportive of Obama ( by 10 - to - 15 percentage points ) than respondents in the landline sample .
For example , in the September survey Obama led McCain by a 55 % - to - 36 % margin among cell only voters , but the candidates were tied at 45 % in the landline sample .
In large part , this reflects the fact that a substantial minority of the cell - only sample is younger than 30 – a demographic group that has consistently backed Obama this year .
Traditional landline surveys are typically weighted to compensate for age and other demographic differences , but the process depends on the assumption that the people reached over landlines are similar politically to their cell - only counterparts .
These surveys suggest that this assumption is increasingly questionable , particularly among younger people .
A Closer Look at Young People
To analyze differences in young people reached in a landline survey with those who are cell - only , the samples for the August and September surveys were pooled to increase the number of young people available for analysis .
In the pooled data , cell - only young people are considerably less likely than young people reached by landline to identify with or lean to the Republican Party , and even less likely to say they support John McCain .
Among landline respondents under age 30 , there is an 18 - point gap in party identification – 54 % identify or lean Democratic while 36 % are Republican .
Among the cell - only respondents under age 30 , there is a 34 - point gap – 62 % are Democrats , 28 % Republican .
The difference among registered voters on the horserace is similar : 39 % of registered voters under 30 reached by landline favor McCain , compared with just 27 % of cell - only respondents .
Obama is backed by 52 % of landline respondents under 30 , compared with 62 % of the cell - only .
These kinds of differences can lead to substantially different estimates of the youth vote .
Weighted data from the August and September combined surveys show Obama with a 27 - point lead among voters ages 18 - 29 .
A weighted estimate derived solely from young people reached by landline would show an Obama lead of 15 points .
There are no differences between the combined and landline sample estimates for any of the older age groups .
Young voters may play a critical role on Election Day .
But will cell - only young people turn out at the same rate as those with a landline phone ?
While 18 - 29 - year - olds reached by cell phone tend to have less experience voting than their landline counterparts , they are just as interested in the 2008 campaign , and express just as much intention to vote this year .
The clearest difference is on past voting behavior .
Just 23 % of cell - only young respondents say they “ always vote , ” compared with 41 % among the landline respondents .
There are small – and statistically non-significant – differences in the share who voted in the 2004 election and who have previously voted in their precinct .
Yet at the same time , most cell - only young people are registered to vote , have given a lot of thought to the election , and say they definitely will vote – factors that are also closely associated with turnout .
Conclusion
Even though the omission of cell phones from election polls does not currently make a large difference in the substantive results , Pew ’s surveys this year suggest at least the possibility of a small bias in landline surveys .
Such a bias could be consequential in an election that appears to be very competitive right now , especially if significant numbers of young people turn out to vote .
In particular , the research suggests that estimates of the candidate preferences of young voters may be biased if cell phone interviewing is not included in the survey .
These problems are all the more pressing as the number of Americans who are reachable only by cell phones increases .
U.S. government surveys estimated that about 15 % of adults were “ cell only ” in the fall of 2007 and the rate of increase since 2004 has been at least 2 % a year , meaning that the number may be as high as 17 % in this election cycle .
Many polling organizations are including cell phones in their samples this fall , and the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press will include cell phone samples in all of its remaining election polls .

Notes
1 In all cases , comparisons are between the weighted combined survey results and the results of the landline interviews ; each sample is weighted independently to the same demographic targets .
The significance test accounts for the overlapping cases in these samples .
Cyberintruders used the Internet to crack into at least 18 computer servers at the World Bank Group last July .
The intrusion , revealed Friday in a FoxNews.com story by veteran investigative reporter Richard Behar , underscores how relentlessly criminals probe corporate IT systems , especially banks , say tech - security experts .
" The sophistication , resolve and organization of cybercriminals are growing exponentially , " says Tom Kellerman , vice president of security awareness at Core Security Technologies .
Kellerman served as a senior risk - management specialist at the World Bank from 2000 to 2006 ; he helped set up the bank 's cyberdefenses .
" Every financial organization is under siege , " he says .
World Bank spokesman Carl Hanlon confirmed the authenticity of bank memos obtained by Behar describing how bank officials discovered — and reacted to — the cyberbreak - in .
" The bottom line is that at no point was any sensitive information accessed , " Hanlon said in a phone interview .
That assertion drew skepticism in tech - security circles .
Several security experts noted that cyberthieves are experts at stealing data without leaving a trace .
" It 's not like when you steal the Mona Lisa and there 's a blank space left on the wall , " says Sophos researcher Graham Cluley .
One bank memo lists the breached servers and makes this assessment : " As of 9/9/08 we have determined that 5 of the compromised servers contain sensitive data , and care must be taken to determine the amount of information that may have been transmitted outside of the World Bank Group . "
Michael Maloof , CTO of TriGeo Network Security , notes that cyberintruders routinely install programs to systematically harvest data , while also continually " sniffing " for access to other computers in the network , including those of partners and customers .
Hanlon acknowledged that " like other public and private institutions , the World Bank has repeatedly experienced hacking attacks on its computer systems and is constantly updating its security to defeat these . "
Banks , indeed , are not the only targets .
Corporate intrusions in general are on the rise , says Phil Neray , vice president at database security firm Guardium .
Cybercrooks seek out PCs used by privileged insiders so they can access sensitive databases and other PCs .
" Many organizations do n't have any real - time monitoring or alerting mechanisms in place to identify unauthorized activities , " Neray says .

CNN is airing misleading footage of the war between Georgia and Russia , skewing public opinion in favor of the Georgians , according to a Russia Today cameraman interviewed this morning .
The Russia Today satellite TV company aired the interview on its English language news channel but the story is yet to appear on the Internet or in any other news outlet .
UPDATE : Russia Today has now posted the following on their website and uploaded a video .
The Russian cameraman charged that CNN had used his footage of Georgian forces attacking Russian civilians in Tskhinvali , the provincial capital of South Ossetia , but then claimed it showed Russians attacking Georgians in the Georgian town of Gori .
The Georgian assault on Tskhinvali , described as an act of genocide and a war crime by Russian officials and other eyewitnesses , led to the slaughter of at least 2,000 civilians .
The fact that Georgia , backed by the U.S. and Israel , were responsible for the provocation that led to the Russian response , has been buried by the majority of western corporate media .
Western media bias to skew popular opinion in favor of the U.S. and NATO client state Georgia was evident from the very start of the conflict .
As we reported yesterday , a prime example of media bias in shielding Georgia from responsibility for the carnage is the fact that news outlets like the BBC continue to report that thousands of civilians were killed in Georgia , with the obvious inference being that these are victims of the Russian onslaught .
But these victims were not killed in Georgia , they were killed in Ossetia – by Georgian forces .
As the Chimes of Freedom Blog elaborates , “ While the Ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the BBC neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of Ossetia showing the destruction caused by the Georgian shelling of the breakaway republic .
All we are getting is one - sided reports of the destruction being caused by the Russians . ”
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev this morning ordered an immediate halt to Russia ’s military operations against Georgia .
“ The purpose of the operation has been achieved … .
The security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored , ” Interfax quoted him as saying .
CNN accused of using misleading war footage
American broadcaster CNN has been accused of using misleading footage in their coverage of the conflict in South Ossetia .
A Russian cameraman says footage of wrecked tanks and ruined buildings , which was purported to be the town of Gori , was in fact the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali .
Gori was said to be about to fall under the control of the Russian army but the cameraman says the video was actually shot in Tskhinvali , which had been flattened by Georgian shelling .
Aleksandr Zhukov , from the Russiya Al - Yaum channel , said : “ When we arrived and news came that Gori was being shelled , I saw my footage .
I said : that ’s not Gori !
That ’s Tskhinvali .
Having crawled through the length and breadth of Tskhinvali , I do n’t need much to tell from which point this or that footage was recorded .
I can swear in front of any tribunal .
I can point at this location on the map of the town , because I and the cameraman of the Rossiya channel videotaped that . ”

GOP Reps .
John B. Shadegg of Arizona , Lee Terry of Nebraska , Henry Brown Jr. of South Carolina and Dan Lungren of California are all fighting for their political lives , a reversal of fortunes that has caught even the most astute campaign observers by surprise .
... If 2008 looks like 2006 , a new wave of veteran Republicans will be out on the streets , and the colleagues they leave behind could find themselves with the smallest minority since the post - Watergate era .
... Despite some early suggestions that John McCain would help a few Republicans in marginal districts , the presidential election is playing to the Democrats ’ favor in races across the country .
Barack Obama ’s current momentum is strong enough that even some Republicans in red states , such as Nebraska , have tied themselves to the Democrats this fall .
In Nebraska , where Obama hired a state director to help him turn out the vote in and around Omaha , Terry just sent voters a piece of mail with a testimonial from a woman who plans to split her vote between the Republican congressman and the Democratic presidential contender -- a sure sign that the GOP brand is lagging along with the economy and McCain ’s own prospects for the White House .
As we 've been reporting all week , Republican members of Congress are starting to look at the reality of pissed off constituents .
Red district incumbents in every part of the country -- not Utah , of course -- are suddenly understanding that the dire warnings they 've been hearing on an abstract level are actually directed at .
Entrenched GOP incumbents in safe districts are suddenly hysterical and making such gargantuan demands on the NRCC that , according to Politico , the GOP has decided to just toss their few long - shot challengers -- like Dean Andal ( CA - 11 ) , Erik Paulsen ( MN - 03 ) , Sydney Hay ( AZ - 01 ) , Richard Goddard ( GA - 08 ) , Dave Schweinkert ( AZ - 05 ) , Jay Love ( AL - 02 ) , Darren White ( NM - 01 ) , Steve Stivers ( OH - 15 ) , Keith Fimian ( VA - 11 ) , Tom McClintock ( CA - 04 ) , Pete Olson ( TX - 22 ) , Dale Sweetland ( NY - 25 ) , Martin Ozinga ( IL - 11 ) , Chris Hackett ( PA - 10 ) , Blaine Luetkemeyer ( MO - 09 ) , Chris Myers ( NJ - 03 ) , Leonard Lance ( NJ - 07 ) , John Gard ( WI - 08 ) , Kirk Schuring ( OH - 16 ) -- overboard .
Even Tom Rooney ( FL - 16 ) , one of the only Republican challengers to a Democratic incumbent -- in this case to Tim Mahoney , a much disliked fake Dem caught up in a sex and payoff scandal -- with a real chance to win , is probably going to have to do it on his own without much help from the party .
That 's because endangered and sinking incumbents like Marilyn Musgrave ( CO - 04 ) , Ric Keller ( FL - 08 ) , Robin Hayes ( NC - 08 ) , Dave Reichert ( WA - 08 ) , Dan Lungren ( CA -03 ) , David Dreier ( CA - 26 ) , Mean Jean Schmidt ( OH - 02 ) , Randy Kuhl ( NY - 29 ) , John Shadegg ( AZ - 03 ) , Ileana Ros-Lehinen ( FL - 18 ) , Phil English ( PA - 03 ) , Tim Walberg ( MI - 07 ) , Joe Knollenberg ( MI - 09 ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( CA - 46 ) , Virgil Goode ( VA - 05 ) , among others , are clamoring for funds to fight off surging Democratic challengers .
Today is the last day of the People For the American Way Progressive Champion competition which will give three winning progressive candidates a total of $ 7,000 -- on top of the $ 100,000 they have already collectively earned in the contest .
If you can even spare one dollar or ten dollars , please use it to help your favorite congressional candidate leverage part of that prize .
The contest ends at midnight tonight ( PT ) .
Just click that link that says " Progressive Champions " above .
Insider the Beltway pundits are predicting one or two dozen GOP defeats .
I think we can hand them four dozen .
Let 's make sure we 're laughing at the pundits again in November like we did in 2006 .
How has it come to this ?
These guys sum up Palin 's role in all this pretty smartly : Some Republicans need no help from John McCain to be dragged down .
McCain loves crowing about how he ( and , ironically , Palin ) have opposed Don Young 's and Ted Stevens ' earmark extravagenza Bridge to Nowhere .
I wonder if he 'll mention Virginia hypocrite Virgil Goode 's earmark for a gay porn movie
Labels : NRCC , PFAW , Republican gay porn earmarks , tsunami , Virgil Goode
Is n’t Palin supposed to move to Cheney ’s undisclosed location after she gets elected , not before ?
Python Programming , news on the Voidspace Python Projects and all things techie .
Release : Mock 0.4.0 , Library for Mocking and Testing
Mock 0.4.0 has just been released , the first release in about ten months ( but worth the wait ) .
Mock is a simple library for testing : specifically for mocking , stubbing and patching .
This new release brings in some cool new features , but some are backwards incompatible so read the release notes if you are updating .
Thanks to all those who emailed me with suggestions and feature requests - most of them got in one way or another ...
What is Mock ?
Mock makes simple mocking trivially easy .
It also provides decorators to help patch module and class level attributes within the scope of a test .
In this release the patch decorator got even easier to use .
You can now call it with one argument - a string in the form ' package_name.module_name.ClassName ' .
This is the fully qualified name of the object you wish to patch .
patch patches the class in the specified module with a Mock object , which is passed in to the decorated function .
( As well as patch creating mocks for you , you can also explicitly pass in an alternative object to patch with . )
What 's New ?
The are now eggs ( for Python 2.4 - 2.6 ) up on the Mock Cheeseshop Page .
This means that if you have setuptools you should be able to install mock with :
easy_install mock
The full changelog is :
Default return value is now a new mock rather than None
' return_value ' added as a keyword argument to the constructor
New method ' assert_called_with '
Added ' side_effect ' attribute / keyword argument called when mock is called
patch decorator split into two decorators : patch_object which takes an object and an attribute name to patch ( plus optionally a value to patch with which defaults to a mock object ) patch which takes a string specifying a target to patch ; in the form ' package.module.Class.attribute '.
( plus optionally a value to patch with which defaults to a mock object )
Can now patch objects with None
Change to patch for nose compatibility with error reporting in wrapped functions
Reset no longer clears children / return value etc - it just resets call count and call args .
It also calls reset on all children ( and the return value if it is a mock ) .
Thanks to Konrad Delong , Kevin Dangoor and others for patches and suggestions .
Examples
As an example , suppose we want to test the following code :
from somewhere import ClassName
class ProductionClass ( object ) :
def create_instance ( self ) :
self .
instance = ClassName ( )
We can test that the create_instance method of ProductionClass instantiates ClassName by patching it at the module level .
This is awkward to do manually , but trivially easy with patch .
@ patch ( ' production_module.ClassName ' )
def testSomething ( self , MockClass ) :
mock_instance = MockClass .
return_value
real_object = ProductionClass ( )
real_object .
create_instance ( )
self .
assertEquals ( real_object .
instance , mock_instance ,
" create_instance did n't create and store ClassName instance " )
Mock objects create attributes on demand ( new mocks ) , and for the same attributes always return the same mock .
You can limit the attributes available using the spec and method keyword arguments .
They provide several attributes for making assertions about how they have been used .
One of my favourites is the new convenience method assert_called _with :
>> > from mock import Mock
>> > mock = Mock ( )
>> > mock .
some_method ( ' hello ' , goodbye = False )
< mock .
Mock object at 0x6f050 >
>> >
>> > mock .
some_method .
assert_called_with ( ' goodbye ' , hello = False )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
. . .
AssertionError : Expected : ( ( ' goodbye ' , ) , { ' hello ' : False } )
Called with : ( ( ' hello ' , ) , { ' goodbye ' : False } )
If you need your mock to raise an exception when called ( to test the exception handling of an API ) , or want to return members of a sequence for repeated calls , you can use the side_effect keyword argument / attribute to do this :
>> > from mock import Mock
>> > def effect ( ) :
. . . raise Exception ( ' Boom ! ' )
. . .
>> > mock = Mock ( side_effect = effect )
>> > mock ( )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
. . .
Exception : Boom !
>> > results = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
>> > def effect ( ) :
. . . mock .
return_value = results . pop ( )
. . .
>> > mock .
side_effect = effect
>> > mock ( ) , mock ( ) , mock ( )
( 3 , 2 , 1 )
The Future
The major thing that Mock does n't do , is provide any ways to customize magic methods like __iter__ or the sequence / mapping protocols .
At work ( where we use Mock extensively but have effectively forked it ) we have implemented these in an ad - hoc nature as we 've needed them - a strategy I 'm not very happy with as a general solution .
One possibility would simply to implement them all , with a clean mechanism for specifying return values .
This would pollute the default Mock class with a lot of extraneous methods , and potentially cause problems with duck - typing where you rely on objects not having implemented certain methods .
I have in mind a class factory solution where you specify which protocol ( magic ) methods you need and get back a custom mock that implements only these .
It will have to be for the next release , and preferably I will implement it when I actually need it so that I can get a feel for whether it is the right solution .

データマイニングでテロリストを識別可能か否かに関するこれまでで最も広範な米政府報告書が、重要な結論を導き出した。その結論とは、データマイニングは（テロリストの識別に）あまり役に立たないというものだ。
米国学術研究会議（NRC）の報告書は、データマイニングやそのほかのメカニズムを使ったテロリストの自動識別は「目標として実現不可能であるばかりでなく、技術開発の取り組みのゴールとしても望ましくない」と結論づけている。NRCは、（自動識別では）誤判定が不可避であり、「ごく普通の、法律を順守している市民や企業が」誤って容疑者と判定される恐れがあると指摘している。この報告書はNRCが何年もかけて作成し、米国時間10月7日にリリースされる予定だ。
「 Protecting Individual Privacy in the Struggle Against Terrorists（テロリストとの闘いにおける個人のプライバシー保護）」と題された352ページにもおよぶ同報告書は、少なくとも、論議を呼んでいるTotal Information Awareness（TIA）と呼ばれる国防省のデータマイニングプログラムを部分的に否定していることになる。
しかし、同報告書の作成者らの野望は、単にTIAやその後継プログラムの諸問題を再考するだけにとどまらない。作成者らは、データマイニングのために存在する現在のさまざまな技術、それらの有効性、そして政府機関が誤判定を防ぐためにそれらの技術をどのように使用すべきかについての学術的評価を作成しようとしている。誤判定が生じれば、例えば、重武装したSWATチームが誰かの家を家宅捜査した際、その家の住人が麻薬組織の一味であると誤信して彼らが飼っている犬を射殺するといった事態も起こりうる。
同報告書を作成した委員会のメンバーには、スタンフォード大学教授のWilliam Perry氏、元マサチューセッツ工科大学学長のCharles Vest氏、サンディア国立研究所の元上級研究員W. Earl Boebert氏 、Microsoft Research のCynthia Dwork氏、シアトルの警察署長のR. Gil Kerlikowske氏、Googleの研究科学 者Daryl Pregibon氏などが含まれている。
メンバーらは、今や米国民はVoIP電話からFacebook、自動車内の無線IC（RFID）タグに至るまであらゆるものを利用しており、オンライン上で活動している米国民は10年前に比べ大幅に増加していると認めている。また、それらの活動を基に作成したデータベースこそ、連邦政府機関が欲しがっているものだと指摘している。さらにメンバーらは、対象者ベースのデータマイニング（ある個人から開始し、その人物から交友関係を辿ってゆく）と、パターンベースのデータマイニング（違法行為を見せる可能性のある異常行動を模索する）の相違点を指摘している。
しかし、報告書では、政府官僚が実現したがっているような（FOXのテレビドラマ「24」のエピソードを多く見ることで影響を受けそうな）データマイニングのやり方は上手く機能しないと結論づけられている。「テロリストのデジタルな足跡を自動的に探し出し、テロリストのコミュニケーションのみを自動でモニターすることが可能であれば、公序良俗の選択はずっと簡単になるだろう。しかし、そうするのは不可能だ」
From HaskellWiki
A developers ' guide to creating a new Haskell project or program , and working in the Haskell developer ecosystem .
Note : for learning the Haskell language itself we recommend these resources .
Almost all new Haskell projects use the following tools .
Each is intrinsically useful , but using a set of common tools also helps everyone by increasing productivity , and you 're more likely to get patches .
Revision control
Use git or darcs unless you have a specific reason not to .
Both are lightweight distributed revision control system .
Darcs is written in Haskell .
They are the two most popular DVCSes in the Haskell world .
If you want to encourage contributions from other Haskell hackers then git is best .
For git , GitHub is very popular .
Darcs hosting is available on hub.darcs.net .
Build system
Built with Cabal
Use Cabal .
You should read at least the start of section 2 of the Cabal User 's Guide .
You should use cabal - install as a front - end for installing your Cabal library .
Cabal - install provides commands not only for building libraries but also for installing them from , and uploading them to , Hackage .
As a bonus , for almost all programs , it 's faster than using Setup .hs scripts directly , since no time is wasted compiling the scripts .
( This does not apply for programs that use custom Setup .hs scripts , since those need to be compiled even when using cabal - install . )
cabal - install is widely available , as a binary distribution or as part of the Haskell Platform , so you can probably assume your users will have it too .
Documentation
For libraries , use Haddock .
Haddock generates nice markup , with links to source .
Testing
Typical unit / spec based testing , particularly with impure code , can be done with HSpec and HUnit .
You can use QuickCheck or SmallCheck to test pure code .
These libraries work best when you have known invariants in your code 's behavior .
See this Cabal file for an example of how to include tests in your Cabal package .
To get started , try Introduction to QuickCheck .
For a slightly more advanced introduction , Simple Unit Testing in Haskell is a blog article about creating a testing framework for QuickCheck using some Template Haskell .
For HUnit , see HUnit 1.0 User's Guide
doctest is another testing method similar to python Doctest
Distribution
The standard mechanism for distributing Haskell libraries and applications is Hackage .
Hackage can host your cabalised tarball releases , and link to any library dependencies your code has .
Users will find and install your packages via " cabal install " , and your package will be integrated into Haskell search engines , like hoogle
Target Environment
If possible , depend on libraries that are provided by the current stable Stackage package versions or the Haskell Platform .
Ideally your package should be able to build with users that keep current with Stackage or users of the Platform .
Structure of a simple project
The basic structure of a new Haskell project can be adopted from HNop , the minimal Haskell project .
It consists of the following files , for the mythical project " haq " .
Haq.hs -- the main haskell source file
haq.cabal -- the cabal build description
Setup.hs -- build script itself
. git -- revision control
README -- info
LICENSE -- license
Of course , you can elaborate on this , with subdirectories and multiple modules .
See Structure of a Haskell project for an example of a larger project 's directory structure .
Here is a transcript that shows how you 'd create a minimal git and cabalised Haskell project for the cool new Haskell program " haq " , build it , install it and release .
Note :
The new tool " cabal init " automates all this for you , but you should understand all the parts even so .
We will now walk through the creation of the infrastructure for a simple Haskell executable .
Advice for libraries follows after .
Create a directory
Create somewhere for the source :
$ mkdir haq $ cd haq
Write some Haskell source
Write your program :
$ cat >
Haq .
hs -- -- Copyright ( c ) 2006 Don Stewart - http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/
-- GPL version 2 or later ( see http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) -- import System .
Environment -- | ' main ' runs the main program main :: IO ( ) main = getArgs >>= print .
haqify .
head haqify s = " Haq ! " ++ s
Stick it in version control
Place the source under revision control ( you may need to enter your e-mail address first , to identify you as maintainer of this source ) :
$ git init $ git add Haq.hs $ git commit - am " my commit message "
Add a build system
Create a .cabal file describing how to build your project :
$ cabal init
that will ask a few questions about your project and generate a file similar to the example :
-- Initial scratch.cabal generated by cabal init .
For further -- documentation , see http://haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/ name : haq version : 0.1.0.0 description : Super cool mega lambdas license : GPL license - file : LICENSE author : Don Stewart maintainer : dons@cse.unsw.edu.au build - type : Simple cabal - version : >=1.10 executable haq main - is : Haq.hs build - depends : base > =4.5 && < 4.8 default - language : Haskell2010
( If your package uses other packages , e.g. text , you 'll need to add them to the build - depends : field as a comma separated list . )
Cabal will also generate a Setup.hs file that will do the actual building .
You will rarely need to modify it .
If you specifed a known license , it will also add a LICENSE file .
You might like to add a README file to tell what your project is about .
Record your changes :
$ git add haq.cabal Setup.hs LICENSE README $ git commit - am " Add a build system "
Build your project
Now build it !
There are two methods of accessing Cabal functionality : through your Setup .hs script or through cabal - install .
cabal - install is now the preferred method .
Building using cabal - install and sandboxes , always use sandboxes in your projects unless you are an expert and know what you are doing !
Demonstrated here :
$ cabal sandbox init $ cabal install -j
This will install your newly minted haq program in $ PROJECT_DIR/.cabal-sandbox / bin .
Run it
And now you can run your cool project :
$ .cabal - sandbox / bin/haq me " Haq ! me "
Since our program does n't rely on any other assets we can just copy it to a directory in our path if we want to be able to use it from anywhere without referencing the sandbox directory .
Like so :
$ sudo cp .cabal-sandbox/bin/haq /usr/local / bin/haq $ haq me " Haq ! me "
Build some haddock documentation
Generate some API documentation into dist / doc /*
Using cabal install :
$ cabal haddock
Using cabal install if you planned to upload your haq package to Hackage :
$ cabal haddock -- hyperlink - source --html-location = '
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haq/docs'
--contents-location='http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haq'
which generates files in dist / doc / including :
$ w3 m - dump dist/doc/html/haq/Main.html haq Contents Index Main Synopsis main :: IO () Documentation main :: IO ( ) main runs the main program Produced by Haddock version 0.7
No output ?
Make sure you have actually installed haddock .
It is a separate program , not something that comes with Cabal .
Note that the stylized comment in the source gets picked up by Haddock .
( Optional ) Improve your code : HLint
HLint can be a valuable tool for improving your coding style , particularly if you 're new to Haskell .
Let 's run it now .
$ hlint .
./ Haq.hs :11:1 : Warning : Eta reduce Found : haqify s = " Haq ! " ++ s
Why not : haqify = ( " Haq ! " ++)
The existing code will work , but let 's follow that suggestion .
Open Haq.hs in your favourite editor and change the line :
where haqify s = " Haq ! " ++ s
to :
where haqify = ( " Haq ! " ++ )
Add some tests
HSpec
If you 'd like to use HSpec :
To your cabal , add :
test - suite tests ghc-options : - Wall default - extensions : Overloaded Strings type : exitcode - stdio - 1.0 main-is : HSpecTests.hs build - depends : base , haq , hspec >= 1.8 default - language : Haskell2010
To enable tests and install HSpec ( and any other needed dependencies ) :
$ cabal install -- enable - tests
Then for your actual file containing the test code :
$ cat > HSpecTests .
hs module Main where import Haq import Test .
Hspec main :: IO ( ) main = hspec $ do describe " Validate haqify function " $ do it " haqify is supposed to prefix Haq ! to things " $ do haqify " me " ` shouldBe ` " Haq ! me "
Execute the tests with :
$ cabal test
QuickCheck
If you 're using QuickCheck :
$ cat > QuickTests . hs import Data .
Char import Data .
List import Haq import Test.
QuickCheck import Text .
Printf main = mapM_ ( \ ( s , a ) -> printf " %- 25s : " s >> a ) tests -- reversing twice a finite list , is the same as identity prop_reversereverse s = ( reverse .
reverse ) s == id s where _ = s :: [ Int ] --
Dropping the " Haq ! " string is the same as identity prop_haq s = drop ( length " Haq ! " ) ( haqify s ) == id s where haqify s = " Haq ! " ++ s tests = [ ( " reverse.reverse/id " , quick Check prop_reversereverse ) , ( " drop.haq / id " , quick Check prop_haq ) ]
To run the test :
$ runhaskell Tests.hs reverse .
reverse/id : +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
drop.haq/id : +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Success !
Tag the stable version , create a tarball , and sell it !
Tag the stable version :
$ git tag 0.0
Create a tarball
You can do this using either Cabal or an explicit tar command .
Using Cabal
Since the code is cabalised , we can create a tarball with cabal - install directly ( you can also use runhaskell Setup .hs sdist , but you need tar on your system [ 1 ] ) :
$ cabal sdist Building source dist for haq - 0.0 ...
Source tarball created : dist / haq-0.0.tar.gz
This has the advantage that Cabal will do a bit more checking , and ensure that the tarball has the structure that HackageDB expects .
Note that it does require the LICENSE file to exist .
It packages up the files needed to build the project ; to include other files ( such as Test.hs in the above example , and our README ) , we need to add :
extra-source - files : Tests.hs README
to the .cabal file to have everything included .
Check that your source package is complete
Just to make sure everything works , try building the source package in some temporary directory :
$ tar xzf haq - 0.0.tar.gz $ cd haq - 0.0 $ cabal configure $ cabal build
and for packages containing libraries ,
$ cabal haddock
Upload your package to Hackage
Whichever of the above methods you 've used to create your package , you can upload it to the Hackage package collection via a web interface .
You may wish to use the package checking interface there first , and fix things it warns about , before uploading your package .
Upload your package documentation to Hackage
Assuming you built your documentation like this :
$ cabal haddock -- hyperlink - source --html-location = '
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haq/docs'
--contents-location='http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haq'
You can force upload ( so you do n't have to wait on the server to build it for you ) your documentation for your package like so :
$ cp -R ./dist/doc/html/haq/ haq-0.0-docs $ tar cvzf -- format=ustar -f haq-0.0-docs.tar.gz haq-0.0 - docs $ curl -X PUT - H ' Content - Type : application / x- tar ' - H ' Content - Encoding : gzip ' -- data - binary '@haq-0.0-docs.tar.gz ' ' https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@hackage.haskell.org/package/haq-0.0/docs'
Summary
The following files were created :
$ ls Haq.hs HSpecTests.hs dist haq.cabal Setup.hs .git haq-0.0.tar.gz QuickTests.hs
Libraries
The process for creating a Haskell library is almost identical .
The differences are as follows , for the hypothetical " ltree " library :
Hierarchical source
The source should live under a directory path that fits into the existing module layout guide .
So we would create the following directory structure , for the module Data .
LTree :
$ mkdir Data $ cat > Data / LTree.hs module Data .
LTree where
So our Data .
LTree module lives in Data / LTree.hs
The Cabal file
Cabal files for libraries list the publically visible modules , and have no executable section :
$ cat > ltree.cabal Name : ltree Version : 0.1 Description : Lambda tree implementation License : BSD3 License - file : LICENSE Author : Don Stewart Maintainer : dons@cse.unsw.edu.au Build - Type : Simple Cabal - Version : >=1.2 Library Build - Depends : base >= 3 && < 5 Exposed - modules : Data .
LTree ghc-options : - Wall
We can thus build our library :
$ cabal configure -- prefix=$ HOME --user $ cabal build Preprocessing library ltree - 0.1 ...
Building ltree - 0.1 ... [ 1 of 1 ] Compiling Data .
LTree ( Data / LTree.hs , dist/ build/Data/LTree.o ) /usr/bin/ar : creating dist / build/libHSltree-0.1.a
and our library has been created as a object archive .
Now install it :
$ cabal install Installing : /home / dons/lib/ltree-0.1/ghc-6.6 & /home/dons /bin ltree -0.1 ... Registering ltree - 0.1 ...
Reading package info from " .installed - pkg - config " ... done .
Saving old package config file ... done .
Writing new package config file ... done .
And we 're done !
To try it out , first make sure that your working directory is anything but the source directory of your library :
$ cd ..
And then use your new library from , for example , ghci :
$ ghci - package ltree Prelude > :m + Data . LTree Prelude Data . LTree >
The new library is in scope , and ready to go .
More complex build systems
For larger projects , you may want to store source trees in subdirectories .
This can be done simply by creating a directory -- for example , " src " -- into which you will put your src tree .
To have Cabal find this code , you add the following line to your Cabal file :
hs - source - dirs : src
You can also set up Cabal to run configure scripts , among other features .
For more information consult the Cabal user guide .
Licenses
Code for the common base library package must be BSD licensed .
Otherwise , it is entirely up to you as the author .
Choose a licence ( inspired by this ) .
Check the licences of things you use ( both other Haskell packages and C libraries ) , since these may impose conditions you must follow .
Use the same licence as related projects , where possible .
The Haskell community is split into 2 camps , roughly : those who release everything under BSD , and ( L ) GPLers .
Some Haskellers recommend avoiding LGPL , due to cross - module optimisation issues .
Like many licensing questions , this advice is controversial .
Several Haskell projects ( wxHaskell , HaXml , etc ) use the LGPL with an extra permissive clause which gets round the cross-module optimisation problem .
Releases
It 's important to release your code as stable , tagged tarballs .
Do n't just rely on your commit hashes for tracking history , tag your released versions and milestones !
git archive generates tarballs directly from a git repository based on the provided tag .
For example :
$ cd fps $ ls Data LICENSE README Setup.hs TODO .git cbits dist fps.cabal tests $ git tag v0.8 $ git archive -- format=tar.gz v0.8 > fps-0.8.tar.gz
You can now just post your fps-0.8.tar.gz
Tag each release using git tag .
For example :
Hosting
Hosting for repos is available from Github and the Haskell community server
There is also a ( minimal ) Github equivalent for Darcs at hub.darcs.net .
Web page
Create a web page documenting your project !
An easy way to do this is to add a project specific page to the Haskell wiki
The user experience
When developing a new Haskell library , it is important to remember how the user expects to be able to build and use a library .
Introductory information and build guide
A typical library user expects to :
Visit Haskell.org
Find the library / program they are looking for : if not found , try mailing list ; if it is hidden , try improving the documentation on haskell.org ; if it does not exist , try contributing code and documentation ) Download Build and install Enjoy
Each of these steps can pose potential road blocks , and code authors can do a lot to help code users avoid such blocks .
Steps 1..2 may be easy enough , and many coders and users are mainly concerned with step 5 .
Steps 3..4 are the ones that often get in the way .
In particular , the following questions should have clear answers :
Which is the latest version ?
What state is it in ?
What are its aims ?
Where is the documentation ?
Which is the right version for given OS and Haskell implementation ?
How is it packaged , and what tools are needed to get and unpack it ?
How is it installed , and what tools are needed to install it ?
How do we handle dependencies ?
How do we provide / acquire the knowledge and tool - chains needed ?
The best place to answer these questions is a README file , distributed with the library or application , and often accompanied with similar text on a more extensive web page .
Tutorials
Generated haddock documentation is usually not enough to help new programmers learn how to use a library .
You must also provide accompanying examples , and even tutorials about the library .
Please consider providing example code for your library or application .
The code should be type - correct and well - commented .
Program structure
Monad transformers are very useful for programming in the large , encapsulating state , and controlling side effects .
To learn more about this approach , try Monad Transformers Step by Step .
Publicity
The best code in the world is meaningless if nobody knows about it .
The process to follow once you 've tagged and released your code is :
Join the community
If you have n't already , join the community .
The best way to do this is to subscribe to at least haskell - cafe@ and haskell@ mailing lists .
Joining the #haskell IRC channel is also an excellent idea .
Announce your project on haskell@
Most important : announce your project releases to the haskell@haskell.org mailing list .
Tag your email subject line with " ANNOUNCE : ... " .
This ensure it will then make it into the Haskell Weekly News .
To be doubly sure , you can email the release text to the HWN editor .
Add your code to the public collections
Add your library or application to the Libraries and tools page , under the relevant category , so people can find it .

The Lone Ranger Is Sarah Palin Playing with Fire ?
The McCain campaign insists it is not fanning the flames of racism .
But has Sarah Palin gone too far in painting Barack Obama as " the other ? "
SPIEGEL ONLINE blogger Peter Ross Range thinks she might have .
More than 13,000 people have joined a Facebook group that helps Canadian voters cooperate with the aim of defeating Stephen Harper and the Conservatives .
The group , called Anti-Harper Vote Swap Canada , along with a related Facebook application , encourages people concerned about the prospect of a Conservative majority to vote strategically in the federal election on Tuesday ( October 14 ) .
People have until midnight tonight ( October 9 ) , to register to swap their votes .
Just how does vote - swapping work ?
The group offers this example :
Let ’s pretend I ’m an NDP supporter in the riding of Winnipeg South .
Seeing as the Tories only managed to beat the Liberals by less than 150 votes in the 2006 election , the Liberals almost surely have the best chance of winning .
I use the “ anti- Harper Vote Swap ” facebook application to indicate that I ’m an NDP supporter who is willing to vote for anyone but the Conservatives .
Even if you do n’t know the latest polling data in your riding , we can help .
We will then match you up with another member of the group ( in this example , a Liberal in a strong NDP riding who is willing to swap ) .
Assuming we find you a match , you ’ll receive a message a few days before the election letting you know that your vote can be swapped .
CBC News reported September 17 that Elections Canada has determined that on - line vote - swapping is legal , as long as no money changes hands .

So , you ’ve worked on IBM ® AIX ® for a while now .
You ’ve learned a few of the basic commands to help you maneuver through a directory structure , create and modify files , see what processes are running , and maybe even administer users and the system .
That ’s great , but you want to understand what the UNIX ® administrators next to you are typing .
It looks like a lot of commands interspersed with strange symbols .
Learn what | , > , >> , < , << , [ [ and ] ] , and many more symbols mean in UNIX and Linux ® as well as how to get the most out of operators such as && , || , < , <= , and != .
Pipeline
If you ’re familiar with UNIX , the pipeline , or pipe , is an integral part of everyday processing .
Originally developed by Malcolm McIlroy , the pipeline allows you to redirect the standard output ( stdout ) of one command to become the standard input ( stdin ) of the following command in a single chained execution .
Using the pipeline is n’t limited to one instance per execution .
Quite often , the stdout of one command is used as stdin of the following command , and the subsequent stdout is redirected yet again as stdin to another command and so on .
For example , one of the first things most UNIX administrators do on their systems during troubleshooting or daily checks is look at processes running currently on the system .
Listing 1 shows such a check .
Listing 1 . Example of a daily process check

The listing of the processes currently running on a system can be simple , as shown in Listing 1 ; however , most production systems run several more processes that make the output of ps much longer .
To shorten the list to what you ’re looking for , redirect the standard output of ps â€" ef using a pipeline to grep to search for exactly what you want to see .
Listing 2 shows the process list from Listing 1 redirected to grep to search for the strings “ rpc ” and “ ksh . ”
Listing 2 . Redirecting the process list to grep
# ps â€" ef | grep â€ " E " rpc|ksh " root 196718 151674 0 11:00:27 - 0:00 /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd daemon 225402 151674 0 11:00:27 - 0:00 /usr/sbin/rpc.statd root 229498 151674 0 11:00:27 - 0:00 /usr/sbin/rpc.lockd root 340144 168018 0 12:34:56 - 0:00 rpc.ttdbserver 100083 1 cormany 409708 569522 0 19:29:27 pts/1 0:00 - ksh cormany

Using the pipeline can be much more complicated when you redirect stdout to stdin several times .
In the following example , the previous ps and grep example is expanded to pipeline the stdout to another grep to exclude any previous strings found that includes “ grep ” or “ ttdbserver . ”
When the final grep operation has finished , the stdout is redirected again using a pipeline to an awk statement to print any of the processes found with a process identifier ( PID ) larger than 200,000 :
# ps â€" ef | grep â€ " E " rpc|ksh " | grep -vE " grep|rpc.ttdbserver " | awk -v _MAX_PID=200000 '{if ( $ 2 > _ MAX_PID ) {print " PID for process " , $ 8 , " is greater than " , _MAX_PID}} ' PID for process / usr / sbin /rpc.statd is greater than 200000 PID for process / usr / sbin /rpc.lockd is greater than 200000 PID for process - ksh is greater than 200000 Show more Show more icon
Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of the command ’s stdout redirecting to stdin for the subsequent command .
Figure 1 . Pipeline example
Data redirection with > , >> , < , and <<
Another important aspect of executing commands from the command - line interface ( CLI ) is the ability to write various outputs to a device or to read input into a command from another device .
To write the output of a command , append the greater - than symbol (> or >>) and the target file name or device desired after the command to be executed .
If the target file does n’t exist and you have Write permissions to the target directory , > and >> create the file with permissions of your umask and write the command ’s output to the newly created file .
If , however , the file does exist , > attempts to open the file and overwrite the entire contents .
If you would rather append to the file , simply use >>.
Think of it as the flow of output data moving from the command on the left moving to the destination file on the right ( that is , < cmd > -> < output > -> < file > ) .
The following example executes the ps â€" ef sample shown in the section , “ Pipeline , ” and redirects the output to a file named ps_out :
# ps â€" ef | grep â€ " E " rpc|ksh " > ps_out Show more
Show more icon
The following code executes the earlier extended pipeline example and redirects the output to the same file — ps_out — but appends to the current data :
# ps â€" ef | grep â€ " E " rpc|ksh " | grep -vE " grep|rpc.ttdbserver " | awk -v _MAX_PID=200000 '{if ( $ 2 > _ MAX_PID ) {print " PID for process " , $ 8 , " is greater than " , _MAX_PID}} ' >> ps_out Show more

Listing 3 shows the output from the last two redirections .
Listing 3 . Output from subsequent redirections
# cat ps_out root 196718 151674 0 11:00:27 - 0:00 /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd daemon 225402 151674 0 11:00:27 - 0:00 /usr/sbin/rpc.statd root 229498 151674 0 11:00:27 - 0:00 /usr/sbin/rpc.lockd root 340144 168018 0 12:34:56 - 0:00 rpc.ttdbserver 100083 1 cormany 409708 569522 0 19:29:27 pts/1 0:00 - ksh cormany

When redirecting output with > alone , only the stdout of the command is redirected .
Keep in mind that with computing , there is stdout as well as stderr :
The former is represented as 1 , while stderr is 2 .
Redirecting output in UNIX is no different .
Simply place the desired output type before the > ( for example , 1 > , 2 > ) to tell the shell where to route the output .
Listing 4 attempts to list files file A.tar.bz2 and fileC.tar.bz2 .
Unfortunately , as shown in the first command ( ls ) , file C.tar.bz2 does n’t exist .
Thankfully , we remembered to separate stdout into ls.out and stderr into ls.err .
Listing 4 . Listing the files fileA.tar.bz2 and fileC.tar.bz2
# ls fileA.tar.bz2 fileAA.tar.bz2 fileB.tar.bz2 fileBB.tar.bz2 # ls fileA.tar.bz2 fileC.tar.bz2 1 > ls.out 2 > ls.err # cat ls.out fileA.tar.bz2 # cat ls.err ls : 0653-341
The file file C.tar. bz2 does not exist .

The same rules apply in AIX with > and >> on stdout and stderr .
For example , the same output files can be used for future tests , as Listing 5 shows .
Listing 5 . Using output files for future tests
# ls fileB.tar.bz2 fileD.tar.bz2 1 >> ls.out 2 >> ls.err # cat ls.out fileA.tar.bz2 fileB.tar.bz2 # cat ls.err ls : 0653-341
The file file C.tar. bz2 does not exist .
ls : 0653 -341
The file file D.tar. bz2 does not exist .

There are times when you may need to have both stdout and stderr written to the same file or device .
You can do this in either of two ways .
The first method is to direct 1 > and 2 > to the same file :
# ls fileA.tar.bz2 fileC.tar.bz2 1 > ls.out 2 > ls.out # cat ls.out fileA.tar.bz2 ls : 0653-341
The file file C.tar. bz2 does not exist .
Show more
Show more icon
The second method is a simpler and quicker way to accomplish the same thing and is used more frequently by experienced UNIX users :
# ls fileA.tar.bz2 fileC.tar.bz2 > ls.out 2>&1 # cat ls.out fileA.tar.bz2 ls : 0653-341
The file file C.tar. bz2 does not exist .
Show more
Show more icon
Let ’s break the statement down .
First , ls fileA.tar.bz2 fileC.tar.bz2 is executed .
The stdout is redirected to ls.out with > ls.out , and stderr is redirected to the same file to which stdout is redirected ( ls.out ) with 2>&1 .
Remember that you can redirect output to files as well as other devices .
You can redirect data to printers , floppy disks , Terminal Types ( TTYs ) , and various other devices .
For example , if you wanted to send a message to a single user on all sessions ( or TTYs ) , you could just loop through who and redirect a message to the TTYs if you have adequate permissions , as shown in Listing 6 .
Listing 6 . Redirecting a message to a TTY
# for _TTY in ' who | grep " cormany " | awk '{print $ 2} ' ' > do > _ TTY=" / dev/${_TTY} " > echo " Sending message to cormany on $ {_TTY} " > echo " Test Message to cormany@$ {_TTY} " > $ {_TTY} > done Sending message to cormany on / dev/ pts /13 Test Message to cormany@ / dev/ pts/13

Stdin , not stdout
Although using > and >> seems a relatively easy concept for most to pick up , it ’s common for others to have difficulties using the less - than symbols (< and << ) .
When thinking of > and >> , it ’s easiest to visualize them as the flow of output data moving from the command on the left to the destination file on the right .
The same applies to < and <<.
Using < , you essentially execute a command with stdin already supplied .
Think of it as the data already provided supplied to the command on the left of the data as stdin ( that is , < cmd > <- < data > ) .
For example , say you want to send an e-mail of an ASCII text file to another user .
You could use a pipeline to redirect the stdout of cat to stdin of mail ( that is , cat mail_file .
out | mail âs " Here 's your E - mail ! " acormany@yahoo.com ) , or you could redirect the contents of the file to become stdin for the mail command :
# mail â€ "s " Here 's your E - mail ! " acormany@yahoo.com < mail_file.out

Using << , also known as a here - document , can save some formatting time and is easier on the processing time of the command execution .
By using << , the string of text is directed to the command to execute as stdin , but you can continue to enter information until the termination identifier has been reached .
Simply type the command following << and the termination identifier , type anything you want , and end it with the termination identifier on a new line .
Using the here - document allows you to preserver whitespace , new lines , and so on .
For example , rather than typing five echo statements that UNIX would have to process individually :
# echo " Line 1 " Line 1 # echo " Line 2 " Line 2 # echo " Line 3 " Line 3 # echo " Line 4 " Line 4 # echo " Line 5 " Line 5 Show more Show more icon
you could use the following code to replace the multi- echo statement , and UNIX would only need to process a single execution :
# cat << EOF > Line 1 > Line 2 > Line 3 > Line 4 > Line 5 > EOF Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 Line 4 Line 5

Show more icon
To allow tabs to make everything look a bit neater in the shell script , simply place a hyphen ( - ) between the << and the termination identifier :
# cat <<- ATC > Line 1 > Line 2 > Line 3 > Line 4 > Line 5 > ATC Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 Line 4 Line 5

Subshells
Sometimes , you need to execute several commands together .
For example , if you want to perform a specific action in a different directory , you could use the code in Listing 8 .
Listing 8 . Execute several commands at the same time
# pwd /home / cormany # cd testdir # tar â€" cf ls_output.
tar ls.out ?
# pwd /home / cormany / testdir Show more

This works , but note that after the execution of theses steps , you ’re no longer in your original directory .
By placing the commands into their own subshell , they execute as a single instance of the subshell .
Listing 9 shows the same idea executed using a subshell .

# pwd /home / cormany # ( cd testdir ; tar - cf ls_output. tar ls.out ? ) # pwd /home / cormany

The test command , [ ] , and [ [ ] ]
When writing a shell script or programming in any modern language , the ability to evaluate expressions or values is essential to competent programs .
UNIX has it covered as always with the test command .
As the test man page states , the test command evaluates expression parameters and , if the expression value is True , returns a zero ( True ) exit value .
For more information on the definition of test and all the available conditions , see the test man page .
To use the test command , simply provide the command with the appropriate flag and file name .
When test has evaluated the expression , you ’re returned to a command prompt , where you can verify the return code , as shown in Listing 10 .
Listing 10 .
Verify return code
# ls â€"l - rwxr - xr-x 1 cormany atc 786 Feb 22 16:11 check_file - rw-r--r-- 1 cormany atc 0 Aug 04 20:57 emptyfile # test -f emptyfile # echo $ ?
0 # test -f badfilename # echo $ ?
1 Show more
Show more icon
As stated in the definition , test returns a zero exit value if the expression value was True or a non -zero exit value ( that is , 1 ) .
In Listing 10 , the file emptyfile was found , so test returned 0 ; the file badfilename was not found , so 1 was returned .
Another way to use the test command is to place the expression to evaluate within single brackets ( [ ] ) .
Using the test command or replacing it with [ ] returns the same value , as they are identical executions :
# [ -f emptyfile ] # echo $ ?
0 # [ - f badfilename ] # echo $ ?
1 Show more
Show more icon
Using single brackets ( [ ] ) versus double brackets ( [ [ ] ] ) is a personal preference and really depends on how you ’ve been taught commands and shell scripting .
But keep in mind that there are some differences between the two evaluations .
Although [ ] and [ [ ] ] use the same test operators during evaluation , they use different logical operators .
Operators
In ksh , the default shell used in AIX , as well as other shells used in UNIX and Linux , it ’s important to know how to use test , logical , and substitution operators .
Test operators
When writing shell scripts , test operators are crucial to error checking and for checking the status of files .
The following test operators are just a few that you can use in ksh as well as other standard UNIX shells :
-d < file > : < file > is a directory
is a directory -e < flle > : < file > exists
exists -f < file > : < file > is a regular file
is a regular file -n < string > : < string > is not NULL
is not NULL -r < file > :
The user has Read permissions to < file >
The user has Read permissions to -s < file > : < file > size is greater than 0
size is greater than 0 -w < file > :
The user has Write permissions to < file >
The user has Write permissions to -x < file > :
The user has Execute permissions to < file >
The user has Execute permissions to - z < string > : < string > is null
is null - L < file > : < file > is a symbolic link
Remember , in UNIX directories , devices , symbolic links , and other objects are all files , so the test operators shown above will work with every type of file .
Everyone has an individual style of shell scripting .
Whether they use [ [ ] ] or [ ] in test statements , the above test operators will function the same .
This article uses [ [ ] ] .
Listing 11 shows how you can use a few of the test operators listed above .
Listing 11 .
Using test operators
#!/usr /bin/ksh while true do echo "
Enter file to check : \c " read _FNAME if [ [ ! -e " $ {_FNAME} " ] ] then echo " Unable to find file ' $ {_FNAME} ' " continue fi if [ [ -f " $ {_FNAME} " ] ] then echo " ${_FNAME} is a file . " elif [ [ -d " $ {_FNAME} " ] ] then echo " ${_FNAME} is a directory . " elif [ [ - L " $ {_FNAME} " ] ] then echo " ${_FNAME} is a symbolic link . " else echo " Unable to determine file type for ' $ {_FNAME} ' " fi [ [ -r " $ {_FNAME} " ] ] && echo " User $ {USER} can read ' $ {_FNAME} ' " [ [ -w " $ {_FNAME} " ] ] && echo " User $ {USER} can write to ' $ {_FNAME} ' " [ [ -x " $ {_FNAME} " ] ] && echo " User $ {USER} can execute ' $ {_FNAME} ' " if [ [ -s " $ {_FNAME} " ] ] then echo " ${_FNAME} is NOT empty . " else echo " ${_FNAME} is empty . " fi done

Executing the code in Listing 11 and checking a few file names produces the output shown in Listing 12 .
Listing 12 .
Output from executing the test operators
# ls â€"l - rwxr - xr-x 1 cormany atc 786 Feb 22 16:11 check_file - rw-r--r-- 1 cormany atc 0 Aug 04 20:57 emptyfile # ./ check_file

To learn more about test operators and to see a complete listing of test operators , execute man test .
Logical operators
Another important set of operators in UNIX is the logical operators .
Like in most modern programming languages , the AND and OR statements are necessary for definitive conditional evaluations of expressions or their values .
If you ’ve read any of my previous articles ( see Related topics ) , you ’ll notice that I favor logical operators over writing several lines of code .
This keeps the scripts clean and easy to manage .
One of the first things I do when writing a script is to write the exit_msg ( ) function :
exit_msg ( ) { [ [ $ # - gt 1 ] ] && echo " $ {0 # #*/} ( $ { 1} ) â  $ { 2} " exit $ {1:-0} } Show more Show more icon
rather than having ugly and bloated code like that shown in Listing 13 .
Listing 13 .
The alternative to using the exit_msg ( ) function and clean logical operators
#!/usr/bin/ksh if [ [ -n $ {_NUM1} ] ] then unset _ NUM1 fi if [ [ -n $ {_NUM2} ] ] then unset _NUM2 fi while [ [ - z $ {_NUM1} ] ] || [ [ - z $ {_NUM2} ] ] do echo " Enter 2 sets of numbers : \c " read _NUM1 _NUM2 done echo " Enter file to log results to : \c " read _FNAME if [ [ ! -e " $ {_FNAME} " ] ] then echo " File ' $ {_FNAME} ' does n't exist .
A new log will be created . " fi touch " $ {_FNAME} " if [ [ ! -w " $ {_FNAME} " ] ] then echo " Unable to write to file ' $ {_FNAME} ' " exit 1 fi expr $ {_NUM1} \/ 1 > / dev/null 2>&1 if [ [ $ ? - ne 0 ] ] then echo " Number ' $ {_NUM1} ' is not numeric . " exit 2 fi expr $ {_NUM2} \/ 1 > / dev/null 2>&1 if [ [ $ ? - ne 0 ] ] then echo " Number ' $ {_NUM2} ' is not numeric . " exit 2 fi echo " ${_NUM1} , ${_NUM2} " >> " $ {_FNAME} " Show more

By using a simple function like exit_msg ( ) and a few logical operators , the script could be condensed into the better - looking and easier - to - understand program shown in Listing 14 .

The previous examples focused more on the AND ( && ) and OR ( || ) logical operators .
In addition to these , you can use the AND ( â€ " a ) and OR ( â€" o ) operators as discussed in the section describing [ ] versus [ [ ] ] .
If using the test command or single brackets ( [ ] ) , use â€ " a and â€"o to evaluate the expression .
If , however , you use double brackets ( [ [ ] ] ) , use && and || :
# [ [ " Paul " != " Xander " && 2 - gt 0 ] ] # echo $ ?
0 # [ " Paul " != " Xander " -a 2 - gt 0 ] # echo $ ?

Comparison test operators
Another set of test operators is called comparison test operators .
Like the previous set of test operators , comparison test operators are a handy way to perform error checking or to test values against another value .
The previous test operators were used mostly on files or to see if a variable was defined , but the comparison test operators are used more on strings and numeric values .
This can be useful when checking dates , file sizes , if one string is the same as another string , and so on .
The comparison test operators are :
< fileA > - nt < fileB > : fileA is newer than file B
fileA is newer than fileB < fileA > - ot < fileB > : fileA is older than file B
fileA is older than fileB < fileA > - ef < fileB > : fileA and fileB point to the same file
fileA and fileB point to the same file < string > = < pattern > : string matches pattern
string matches pattern < string > != < pattern > : string does not match pattern
string does not match pattern < stringA > < < stringB > : stringA comes before stringB in dictionary order
stringA comes before stringB in dictionary order < stringA > > < stringB > : stringA comes after stringB in dictionary order
stringA comes after stringB in dictionary order < exprA > - eq < exprB > : expressionA is equal to expressionB
expressionA is equal to expressionB < exprA > - ne < exprB > : expressionA is not equal to expressionB
expressionA is not equal to expressionB < exprA > - lt < exprB > : expressionA is less than expressionB
expressionA is less than expressionB < exprA > - gt < exprB > : expressionA is greater than expressionB
expressionA is greater than expressionB < exprA > - le < exprB > : expressionA is less than or equal to expressionB
expressionA is less than or equal to expressionB < exprA > - ge < exprB > : expressionA is greater than or equal to expressionB
You use the same format on comparison test operators as other operators .
You can use either test , [ ] , or [ [ ] ] .
Listing 15 , Listing 16 , and Listing 17 display how you can use numeric , string , and file comparisons , respectively .
Listing 15 .

Substitution operators
It ’s easy to forget to define a variable or assign a value to it when a script grows or you have n’t touched the script for years and need to add to it .
Other times , it would be handy to tell users that a value is set or set up some defaults for your users .
Substitution operators are a great address to these problems :
$ {var - value} : If < var > exists , return < var > ‘s value .
If < var > does n’t exist , return < value > .
If exists , return ‘s value .
If does n’t exist , return .
$ {var=value} : If < var > exists , return < var > ‘s value .
If < var > does n’t exist , set < var > to < value > and return < value > .
If exists , return ‘s value .
If does n’t exist , set to and return .
$ {var +value} : If < var > exists , return < value > .
If < var > does n’t exist , return NULL .
If exists , return .
If does n’t exist , return NULL .
$ {var ? value} : If < var > exists , return < var > ‘s value .
If < var > does n’t exist , exit the command or script and display the error message set with < value > .
If < value > is n’t set , a default error message of “ Parameter null or not set ” is displayed .
If exists , return ‘s value .
If does n’t exist , exit the command or script and display the error message set with .
If is n’t set , a default error message of “ Parameter null or not set ” is displayed .
$ {var :- value} : If < var > exists and is n’t NULL , return < var > ‘s value .
If < var > does n’t exist or is NULL , return < value > .
If exists and is n’t NULL , return ‘s value .
If does n’t exist or is NULL , return .
$ {var : =value} : If < var > exists and is n’t NULL , return < var > ‘s value .
If < var > does n’t exist or is NULL , set < var > to < value > and return < value > .
If exists and is n’t NULL , return ‘s value .
If does n’t exist or is NULL , set to and return .
$ {var : + value} : If < var > exists and is n’t NULL , return < value > .
If < var > does n’t exist or is NULL , return NULL .
If exists and is n’t NULL , return .
If does n’t exist or is NULL , return NULL .
$ {var :? value} : If < var > exists and is n’t NULL , return < var > ‘s value .
If < var > does n’t exist or is NULL , exit the command or script and display the error message set with < value > .
If < value > is n’t set , a default error message of “ Parameter null or not set ” is displayed .
Note the subtle difference between the first group of four definitions and the second set of four .
The last set includes a colon ( : ) between the variable name and the substitution operator , which adds the check to see if the variable is NULL , as well .
Another important note to think about when trying to assign values to variables with substitution operators is that assigning a value to a variable has the same rules as defining a variable normally from the command line or a script .
Protected reserved variables cannot be overwritten with a new value ( for example , $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3 ) .
Listing 18 provides an example of how the variables work .
Note that you can combine several substitution operators , as shown in the last line of the script .
Listing 18 .

Conclusion
After reading this article , you should have a better understanding of all those “ strange ” characters UNIX users are typing .
Knowing how to redirect data as stdin or stdout , how to use the pipe , and how to use operators in UNIX helps you write more powerful scripts with better error trapping and cleaner logic .
Good luck !

I have some good news and I have some bad news
The good news is that this week the Worcester District Attorney ’s Office ruled that the Milford ( Mass . )
Board of Selectmen violated the Open Meeting Law in July by meeting privately with a Colorado real estate developer who wanted to talk about his proposal to locate a casino along I -495 in the Milford area .
Selectmen had closed the doors for an executive session under the exemption that allows town boards “ to consider the purchase , exchange , lease or value of real property if an open discussion may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the governmental body with a person , firm or corporation . ”
The key point here , and the one upon which the Milford Daily News ( a GateHouse Media newspaper , along with the MetroWest Daily News ) filed the complaint with the Worcester DA , is that the exemption is meant to let town boards discuss their strategy in possible real estate deals in private , but NOT with the party with whom they might eventually be negotiating .
In the Milford case , the developer wanted to talk about his proposal for a casino , which might include the purchase of a large tract of town - owned land , but no plans are on the table , no negotiating has started and the developer and board are months , if not years away from talking turkey .
Our belief at the newspaper was that selectmen wanted to close the doors so the developer would n’t have to reveal any details about exactly what stretch of I -495 might be involved and what parcels of land – whether private property or town - owned land – might be eyed for a casino .
The DA investigated and this week concluded the selectmen violated “ both the letter and the spirit ” of the law by closing out the public and the press .
The DA ’s office , represented by Assistant District Attorney David A. Tiberii , ordered the town to release minutes of the executive session , which it did promptly .
Here ’s a link to our story on this ruling , with an additional link there to a PDF of the document .
So what ’s the bad news ?
I believe that the staffing cuts and added workload at media companies today will make many of us put our watchdog roles on hold .
I ’ve long been an advocate for newspapers filing complaints when reporters encounter outright abuse or even suspected ignorance about the Open Meeting Law in Massachusetts .
It ’s a rare day that a private citizen has the time or the energy to file a complaint against a city or town board , so I have always believed newspapers should do this , on behalf of private citizens .
My concern is that the wave of layoffs , buyouts and overall cutbacks we ’re seeing at newspapers in New England , my own included , will mean there will be fewer people left who know the importance of enforcing the Open Meeting Law .
And even if we ’re still here and trying to keep our local officials honest , we ’re understaffed and juggling more work than ever .
Will it be too much trouble to write the complaint letter , pull together the documents and write the stories that come with filing an OML complaint ?
That ’s my fear , that in the rush just to get our “ regular ” work done , we ’ll leave the really important things – including our important role as watchdogs – until last , or not follow through on them at all .
So prove me wrong , will ya ?

A Brief History of English , with Chronologyby Suzanne Kemmer © 2001 - 2005 Pre-English | Old English | Middle English | Modern English
The language we call English was first brought to the north sea coasts of England in the 5th and 6th centuries A.D. , by seafaring people from Denmark and the northwestern coasts of present - day Germany and the Netherlands .
These immigrants spoke a cluster of related dialects falling within the Germanic branch of the Indo - European language family .
Their language began to develop its own distinctive features in isolation from the continental Germanic languages , and by 600 A.D. had developed into what we call Old English or Anglo - Saxon , covering the territory of most of modern England .
New waves of Germanic invaders and settlers came from Norway and Denmark starting in the late 8th century .
The more violent of these were known as Vikings , sea-faring plunderers who retained their ancient pagan gods and attacked settlements and churches for gold and silver .
They spoke a northern Germanic dialect similar to , yet different in grammar from Anglo - Saxon .
In the 11th century , the attacks became organized , state - sponsored military invasions and England was even ruled for a time by the kings of Denmark and Norway .
The Scandinavian influence on the language was strongest in the north and lasted for a full 600 years , although English seems to have been adopted by the settlers fairly early on .
The Norman Invasion and Conquest of 1066 was a cataclysmic event that brought new rulers and new cultural , social and linguistic influences to the British Isles .
The Norman French ruling minority dominated the church , government , legal , and educational systems for three centuries .
The Norman establishment used French and Latin , leaving English as the language of the illiterate and powerless majority .
During this period English adopted thousands of words from Norman French and from Latin , and its grammar changed rather radically .
By the end of that time , however , the aristocracy had adopted English as their language and the use and importance of French gradually faded .
The period from the Conquest to the reemergence of English as a full - fledged literary language is called Middle English .
Geoffrey Chaucer wrote his masterpiece , The Canterbury Tales , in Middle English in the late 1300s .
William Caxton set up the first printing press in Britain at the end of the 15th century .
The arrival of printing marks the point at which the language began to take the first steps toward standardization and its eventual role as a national language .
The period from 1500 to about 1650 is called Early Modern English , a period during which notable sound changes , syntactic changes and lexical enrichment took place .
The Great English Vowel Shift , which systematically shifted the phonetic values of all the long vowels in English , occurred during this period .
Word order became more fixed in a subject - verb - object pattern , and English developed a complex auxiliary verb system .
A rush of new vocabulary from the classical languages , the modern European languages , and more distant trading partners such as the countries of Asian minor and the Middle East entered the language as the renaissance influences of culture and trade and the emerging scientific community of Europe took root in England .
Shakespeare wrote prolifically during the late 1500s and early 1600s and , like Chaucer , took the language into new and creative literary territory .
His influence on English drama and poetry continued to grow after his death in 1616 and he has never been surpassed as the best known and most read poet / playwright of modern English .
The King James Bible was published in 1611 , the culmination of at least a century of efforts to bring a Bible written in the native language of the people into the Church establishment and into people 's homes .
Among the common people , whose contact with literature often did not go far past the Bible , the language of the scriptures as presented in this version commissioned by King James I was deeply influential , due in part to its religious significance , but also to its literary quality .
Its simple style and use of native vocabulary had a surpassing beauty that still resonates today .
By the 1700s almost all of the modern syntactic patterns of English were in place and the language is easily readable by modern speakers .
Colonization of new territories by the newly united Kingdom of Great Britain spread English to the far corners of the globe and brought cargoes of still more loanwords from those far - flung places .
At this point English began to develop its major world dialectal varieties , some of which would develop into national standards for newly independent colonies .
By the 21st century , as the language of international business , science , and popular culture , English has become the most important language on the planet .

Germanic tribes on the continent continue migrations west and south ; consolidate into ever larger units .
Those taking over in Rome call themselves " Roman emperors " , even though the imperial administration had relocated to Byzantium in the 300s .
The new Germanic rulers soon adopt the Christianity of the late Roman state , and begin what later evolves into the not -very - Roman " Holy Roman Empire " .
First Germanic tribes arrive in England .
Settlement of most of Britain by Germanic peoples ( Angles , Saxons , Jutes , some Frisians ) speaking West Germanic dialects descended from Proto - Germanic .
These dialects are distantly related to Latin , but also have a sprinkling of Latin borrowings due to earlier cultural contact with the Romans on the continent .
Celtic peoples , most of whom are Christianized due to the late Roman adoption of Christianity , are pushed increasingly ( despite occasional violent uprisings ) into the marginal areas of Britain : Ireland , Scotland , Wales .
Anglo - Saxons , originally sea-farers , settle down as farmers , exploiting rich English farmland .
By 600 A.D. , the Germanic speech of England comprises dialects of a language distinct from the continental Germanic languages .

Three Danish kings attack Wessex .
Alfred prevails , only to be attacked again a few months later .
His cause looks hopeless .
Decisive battle at Edington ; Alfred and a large contingent of desperate Anglo - Saxons make a last stand ( they know what awaits them if they fail ) .
Alfred leads the Anglo - Saxons to decisive victory ; blockades a large Viking camp nearby , starving them into submission ; and exacts homage from the kings of Denmark and an oath that the Danes will leave Wessex forever .
Under Alfred 's terms of victory , England is partitioned into a part governed by the Anglo - Saxons ( under the house of Wessex ) and a part governed by the Scandinavians ( some of whom become underlords of Alfred ) , divided by Watling Street.
15 years of peace follow ; Alfred reigns over peaceful and prosperous kingdom .

Aethelred has proved to be a weak king , who does not repel minor Viking attacks .
Vikings experiment with a major incursion at Maldon in Essex .
After losing battle , Aethelred bribes them to depart with 10,000 pounds of silver .

Sveinn , king of Denmark , takes note .
After 20 years of continuous battles and bribings , and incompetent and cowardly military leadership and governance , the English capitulate to king Sveinn of Denmark ( later also of Norway ) .
Aethelred flees to Normandy , across the channel .
Sveinn 's young son Cnut ( or Canute ) crowned king of England .

After Cnut 's death his sons bicker over the kingdom .
When they die without issue , the kingdom passes back to the house of Wessex , to young Edward , son of Aethelred and Emma , who had been raised in exile in Normandy .
Edward is a pious , monkish man called " The Confessor " .
Edward has strong partiality for his birthplace , Normandy , a duchy populated by the descendents of Romanized Vikings .
Especially fond of young Duke William of Normandy .
Edward is dominated by his Anglo - Saxon earls , especially powerful earl Godwin .
Godwin's son , Harold Godwinson , becomes de facto ruler as Edward takes less and less interest in governing .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Virginia has n't backed a Democrat for president in 44 years , but economic concerns and changing demographics are giving Sen.
Barack Obama a chance to steal the once reliably red state from Republicans .
Sen . Barack Obama waves as rain falls on a rally in Fredericksburg , Virginia , in late September .
Polls earlier this year showed Sen.
John McCain , the Republican presidential nominee , leading Obama , his Democratic rival , in Virginia by a healthy margin .
A Virginia Commonwealth University poll taken May 12 - 18 had McCain leading 47 percent to 39 percent .
But as the financial crisis has shaken voters ' confidence in the economy , Obama has begun to open a lead in the state , as he has done in other battleground states .
The latest CNN poll of polls has Obama leading McCain 49 percent to 45 percent .
A CNN / TIME / Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted September 28 - 30 shows Obama with an even bigger lead over McCain , 53 percent to 44 percent .
The CNN poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points .
Polls show that voters have more confidence in Obama to handle the economic crisis than they do in McCain , and are more likely to blame Republicans for the recent turmoil than Democrats .
Beside an advantage on the economy , Obama is also benefiting from a demographic shift that has reshaped Virginia politics .
For the last 10 presidential elections , Republicans have been able to bank on Virginia delivering its 13 electoral votes to the GOP .
President Bush won Virginia by 8 percentage points in both 2000 and 2004 , and President Bill Clinton was never able to capture the state when he ran in 1992 and 1996 .
But the explosive growth of Northern Virginia in the last decade has changed the state 's electorate .
Drawn by government jobs in nearby Washington and high - tech jobs in the Dulles corridor , the growing population in Northern Virginia is more liberal than the mostly rural southern portion of the state , which has remained reliably Republican .
In 2000 , Bush carried Northern Virginia 49 percent to 47 percent , but in 2004 , Sen .
John Kerry , the Democratic presidential nominee , carried the area 51 percent to 48 percent .
Virginia " is not as red as people think , " said Doc Thompson , a conservative talk show host for WRVA radio .
" A third of the population in Northern Virginia is pretty liberal .
A lot of people are buying into [ Obama 's ] notion of change . "
Virginia Democrats have been able to exploit the changes in the electorate into statewide electoral success after years in which the Republicans had a virtual lock on the state .
In fact , Virginia Republicans have not won a statewide race since Mark Warner , a former mobile phone company executive , captured the governorship for the Democrats in 2001 by emphasizing economic growth .
Democrat Tim Kaine , who was Warner 's lieutenant governor , succeeded Warner in 2005 .
And in what may have been the most surprising result of the 2006 election cycle , Democrat Jim Webb defeated the incumbent Republican George Allen in the race for one of Virginia 's seats in the U.S. Senate .
The trend favoring the Democrats is expected to continue this year , which is expected to help drive Virginia Democrats to the polls .
The extremely popular Warner is almost certain to win this year 's race against another former governor , Republican Jim Gilmore , to replace Virginia 's long - standing Republican senator , John Warner , who is retiring .
( The two Warners are not related , and John Warner was unopposed in 2002 . )
A Washington Post - ABC
News poll conducted in late September found Warner leading Gilmore by 30 points , and Warner 's victory would give Democrats control of both of Virginia 's seats in the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1970 .
While conservatives may be demoralized by Gilmore 's poor showing , McCain may also face eroding support from Virginia conservatives for his recent proposals for the government to become heavily involved in the U.S. economy , said Thompson , the radio talk show host .
During Tuesday night 's presidential debate , McCain suggested that the government directly buy up to $ 300 billion in home mortgages to help homeowners facing foreclosure .
Thompson said that proposal , along with his support for a $ 700 billion bailout package to help Wall Street firms that McCain voted for last week , are two signs that McCain is breaking from the free - market principles that Virginia conservatives support and not stopping " the march toward socialism " that has begun since the economic crisis started .
" They missed a real opportunity , certainly , in Virginia with my listeners who say they want someone who is fiscally conservative , " said Thompson , who added that he 's considering voting for a third - party candidate .
" They could have come out and said , ' no more spending . ' "

Finally , we are about to reach the last of those seemingly fateful moments that seemed would never arrive in this seemingly endless campaign .
Do you remember , say , mid-2007 , when it was hard to imagine that the Iowa caucuses would ever actually take place ?
They felt then a lifetime away .
But just like Christmas in Whoville after the Grinch had stolen the presents , somehow or other , they came just the same .
So the debates are upon us .
The first comes this Friday , in Oxford , Mississippi , and is focused on foreign policy .
By custom there wo n't be as much campaigning as usual this week as the candidates hunker down and study their briefing books and rehearse their zingers .
And rehearse they do , obsessively .
They even have supporters " play " their opponent in mock - debate settings .
And why should n't they ?
These really are important moments .
They 're the only three chances the people have to size the candidates up , one on one .
If TV viewership of the conventions is any indication , more people will watch these debates than watched spring 's American Idol finale .
More is at stake in these 90 - minute sessions than in any other event on the American political calendar .
You may be familiar with some of the dramatic , history - turning moments .
Gerry Ford saying in 1976 that there was no Soviet domination of Poland .
Ronald Reagan asking voters in 1980 to devastating effect : " Are you better off than you were four years ago ? "
Bill Clinton locking eyes with a citizen in 1992 who asked him to put a human face on the deficit problem , as George HW Bush stood by mute .
Al Gore sighing too much in 2000 .
If that last example does n't seem of a piece with the others , there 's a reason .
These days , debates are n't 90 minutes .
They 're 72 hours .
In today 's American media culture of cable television and ideologically competing blogs , there is first the debate itself and then the debate over the debate .
The latter is hashed out over the three days following the debate , during which the instant , debate - night conventional wisdom can be turned on its head by the side that has the more aggressive spin operation .
That spin starts during the debate itself .
Both sides have teams watching the other guy and recording his misstatements and falsehoods .
Emails are blasted to political journalists .
By the end of the 90 minutes , the reporters may have 30 or 40 emails in their inboxes .
Then cable TV takes over .
There 's an instantly declared winner , based on the pundits ' hunches and focus groups assembled by the networks to watch and react .
On the night of the debate , everyone may generally agree that Candidate A won .
And that 's when the really expert spin begins .
Over the next three days , the side that was declared the instant loser starts spinning that the initial spin was wrong and they actually won .
Sometimes , it works .
Hence Gore in 2000 .
It was generally agreed the night of the first Gore - Bush debate that Gore got the better of things .
But in the succeeding days , the cable nets , led by the all but openly - pro-Republican Fox , started focusing on the question of Gore 's " condescending " sighs ( when Bush lied about Gore 's tax plan , for instance ) .
The sighs , shown repeatedly on cable , became the story , symbolic of the " fact " that Gore was too much a smarty - pants to be president .
That weekend Saturday Night Live spoofed them to great effect .
The debate that Gore had won in real time was , within days , a debate he'd lost .
Candidates need not only to master the issues .
They need to master performance .
Cable television will replay clips ; the candidate who wins the battle of the clips will be the 72 - hour winner .
That means getting off the better one - liners .
And crucially , it means being ready with a witty riposte to the other guy 's one - liners .
Both sides undoubtedly have people anticipating the other fellow 's zingers and crafting counter - zingers .
The topic , foreign policy , is McCain 's alleged strong suit on paper - certainly he 's relieved the topic is n't economic policy , especially given his confused responses to the Wall Street crisis .
He will push his support of the surge in Iraq and press Obama on the latter 's support for diplomacy with Iran and on Israel policy .
Obama will emphasise America 's low standing in the world and the need to get out of Iraq as quickly as is prudently possible .
The substance does n't matter as much as the theatre .
McCain will , for instance , surely needle Obama on the experience question .
Obama had better have a sharp and snappy reply to that .
If he does n't , he could lose the 72 - hour debate in that single exchange .
This is n't the democracy Thomas Jefferson had in mind .
But as Donald Rumsfeld might say , it 's the one we have .

Some see a motherlode of bias in this year 's election coverage .
But there are other factors at play .
Why McCain is getting hosed in the press
Politico political editor Charles Mahtesian was e-mailing the other day with a Republican lobbyist who signed off with a plea that sounded more like a taunt : “ Keep it balanced . ”
A reader e-mailed us with the same sentiment in different language .
“ Are you f** *ing joking !
Your bias has stooped to an all - time low .
Wait , it will probably get worse as election day nears . ”
Those asterisks , by the way , are hers , not ours .
Advertisement
And get a load of this one , from someone in Rochester , N.Y. , who did not like our analysis of the final presidential debate .
“ You guys are awfully tough on McCain .
There may be some legitimacy to the claim of press bias .
Mom . ”
We were all set to dismiss Harris ’ mother as a crank .
Same for VandeHei’s : a conservative dismayed by what she sees as kid-glove treatment of Barack Obama .
Then along came a study — funded by the prestigious Pew Research Center , no less — suggesting at first blush , at least , that they may be on to something .
The Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s researchers found that John McCain , over the six weeks since the Republican convention , got four times as many negative stories as positive ones .
The study found six out of 10 McCain stories were negative .
What ’s more , Obama had more than twice as many positive stories ( 36 percent ) as McCain — and just half the percentage of negative ( 29 percent ) .
You call that balanced ?
OK , let ’s just get this over with :
Yes , in the closing weeks of this election , John McCain and Sarah Palin are getting hosed in the press , and at Politico .
And , yes , based on a combined 35 years in the news business we ’d take an educated guess — nothing so scientific as a Pew study — that Obama will win the votes of probably 80 percent or more of journalists covering the 2008 election .
Most political journalists we know are centrists — instinctually skeptical of ideological zealotry — but with at least a mild liberal tilt to their thinking , particularly on social issues .
So what ?
Before answering the question , indulge us in noting that the subject of ideological bias in the news media is a drag .
The people who care about it typically come at the issue with scalding biases of their own .
Any statement journalists make on the subject can and will be used against them .
So the incentive is to make bland and guarded statements .
Even honest ones , meanwhile , will tend to strike partisans as evasive or self - delusional .
Here goes anyway .
There have been moments in the general election when the one - sidedness of our site — when nearly every story was some variation on how poorly McCain was doing or how well Barack Obama was faring — has made us cringe .
As it happens , McCain ’s campaign is going quite poorly and Obama ’s is going well .
Imposing artificial balance on this reality would be a bias of its own .
Politico was not included in the Pew study .
But our researcher Alex Burns pulled out his highlighter pen and did his own study of Politico 's October stories last week : 110 stories advanced a narrative that was more favorable to Obama than McCain .
Sixty - nine did the opposite .
Our daily parlor game ( which some readers , alas , seem to take a bit more solemnly than we do ) declaring “ who won the day ” has awarded the day to Obama by a 2 - to - 1 margin .
It ’s doubtful even McCain would say he ’s had more good days than that .
Still , journalists should do more than just amplify existing trends .
A couple weeks back , Politico managing editor Bill Nichols sent out a note to the campaign team urging people to cough up more story ideas that took a skeptical look at the campaign tactics and policy proposals of the Democrat , who is likely to be president three months from now .
As it happened , the response was a trickle ( though Nichols and Mahtesian came up with some ideas of their own ) .
Responsible editors would be foolish not to ask themselves the bias question , especially in the closing days of an election .
But , having asked it , our sincere answer is that of the factors driving coverage of this election — and making it less enjoyable for McCain to read his daily clip file than for Obama — ideological favoritism ranks virtually nil .
The main reason is that for most journalists , professional obligations trump personal preferences .
Most political reporters ( investigative journalists tend to have a different psychological makeup ) are temperamentally inclined to see multiple sides of a story , and being detached from their own opinions comes relatively easy .
Reporters obsess about personalities and process , about whose staff are jerks or whether they seem like decent folks , about who has a great stump speech or is funnier in person than they come off in public , about whether Michigan is in play or off the table .
This is the flip side of the fact of how much we care about the horse race — we do n’t care that much about our own opinions of which candidate would do more for world peace or tax cuts .
If that causes skeptics to scoff , perhaps they would find it more satisfying to hear that the reason ideological bias matters so little is that other biases matter so much more .
This is true in any election year .
But the 2008 election has had some unique — and personal — phenomena .
One is McCain backlash .
The Republican once was the best evidence of how little ideology matters .
Even during his “ maverick ” days , McCain was a consistent social conservative , with views on abortion and other cultural issues that would have been odds with those of most reporters we know .
Yet he won swooning coverage for a decade from reporters who liked his accessibility and iconoclasm and supposed commitment to clean politics .
Now he is paying .
McCain ’s decision to limit media access and align himself with the GOP conservative base was an entirely routine , strategic move for a presidential candidate .
But much of the coverage has portrayed this as though it were an unconscionable sellout .
Since then the media often presumes bad faith on McCain ’s part .
The best evidence of this has been the intense focus on the negative nature of his ads , when it is clear Obama has been similarly negative in spots he airs on radio and in swing states .
It is not our impression that many reporters are rooting for Obama personally .
To the contrary , most colleagues on the trail we ’ve spoken with seem to find him a distant and undefined figure .
But he has benefited from the idea that negative attacks that in a normal campaign would be commonplace in this year would carry an out - of - bounds racial subtext .
That ’s why Obama ’s long association with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright was basically a nonissue in the general election .
Journalists ’ hair - trigger racial sensitivity may have been misplaced , but it was not driven by an ideological tilt .
In addition , Obama has benefited from his ability to minimize internal drama and maximize secrecy — and thus to starve the press 's bias for palace intrigue .
In this sense , his campaign bears resemblance to the two run by George W. Bush .
Beyond the particular circumstances of McCain v. Obama , there are other factors in any race that almost always matter more than the personal views of reporters .
The strongest of these is the bias in favor of momentum .
A candidate who is perceived to be doing well tends to get even more positive coverage ( about his or her big crowds or the latest favorable polls or whatever ) .
And a candidate who is perceived to be doing poorly tends to have all events viewed through this prism .
Not coincidentally , this is a bias shared by most of our sources .
This is why the bulk of negative stories about McCain are not about his ideology or policy plans — they are about intrigue and turmoil .
Think back to the past week of coverage on Politico and elsewhere : Coverage has been dominated by Sarah Palin ’s $ 150,000 handbags and glad rags , by finger - pointing in the McCain camp , and by apparent tensions between the candidate and his running mate .
These stories are driven by the flood of Republicans inside and out of the campaign eager to make themselves look good or others look bad .
This always happens when a campaign starts to tank .
Indeed , there was a spate of such stories when Obama ’s campaign hit turmoil after the GOP convention and the Palin surge .
For better or worse , the most common media instincts all have countervailing pressures .
Countering the bias in favor of momentum is the bias against boredom .
We ’ve seen that several times this cycle — an outlying poll number being pumped to suggest big changes in a race that is basically unchanged .
There ’s a good chance you ’ll see this phenomenon more in the next week .
Then there is the bend - over - backward bias .
This is when journalists try so hard to avoid accusations of favoritism that it clouds critical judgment .
A good example were stories suggesting Palin held her own or even won her debate against Joe Biden when it seemed obvious she was simply invoking whatever talking points she had at hand , hanging on for dear life .
Finally , one of the biases of journalists is the same one that is potent for almost all people : the one in favor of self - defensiveness .
That ’s why , even though we think ideological bias is pretty low on the list of journalistic maladies in this election , it is not viable for reporters to dismiss criticism out of hand .
So there you go , Ma : We ’ll look into it .

( NaturalNews ) German government researchers have concluded that a bestselling Bayer pesticide is responsible for the recent massive die - off of honeybees across the country ’s Baden - Württemberg region .
In response , the government has banned an entire family of pesticides , fueling accusations that pesticides may be responsible for the current worldwide epidemic of honeybee die - offs .
Researchers found buildup of the pesticide clothianidin in the tissues of 99 percent of dead bees in Baden - Württemberg state .
The German Research Center for Cultivated Plants concluded that nearly 97 percent of honeybee deaths had been caused directly by contact with the insecticide .
“ It can unequivocally be concluded that a poisoning of the bees is due to the rub - off of the pesticide ingredient clothianidin from corn seeds , ” said the federal agricultural research agency , the Julius Kuehn Institute .
The pesticide was applied to rapeseed and sweet corn seeds along the Rhine River Valley , which borders Baden - Württemberg to the west and south .
“ Beekeepers in the region started finding piles of dead bees at the entrance of hives in early May , right around the time corn seeding takes place , ” said Walter Haefeker , president of the European Professional Beekeepers Association .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
A total of two - thirds of all bees in the entire state are believed to have been killed by the chemical .
“ It ’s a real bee emergency , ” said Manfred Hederer , president of the German Professional Beekeepers ’ Association .
“ Fifty to 60 percent of the bees have died on average , and some beekeepers have lost all their hives . ”
Clothianidin , marketed in Europe under the brand name Poncho , is a widely used insecticide in the neonicotinoid family .
Like all neonicotinoids , it is a systemic pesticide that is applied to the seeds of plants and then spreads itself throughout all plant tissues .
Based on nicotine , the neonicotinoids function as neurotoxins that attack the nervous systems of insects such as honeybees .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has classified clothianidin as “ highly toxic ” to honeybees .
The chemical was approved for U.S. use in 2003 and German use in 2004 .
Clothianidin manufacturer Bayer CropScience , a subsidiary of chemical giant Bayer , blamed the honeybee deaths on incorrect application of the pesticide .
Before seeds are sprayed , a fixative should be applied to keep the poison from spreading into the rest of the environment .
In the current situation , Bayer says , the fixative was not applied and clothianidin spread into the air .
But beekeepers and pesticide critics rejected this explanation , calling for Germany to follow France ’s footsteps in banning the chemical – and indeed , all neonicotinoids .
“ We have been pointing out the risks of neonicotinoids for almost 10 years now , ” said Philipp Mimkes , spokesman for the Coalition Against Bayer Dangers .
“ This proves without a doubt that the chemicals can come into contact with bees and kill them .
These pesticides should n’t be on the market . ”
While stopping short of a total ban , the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety acted quickly upon release of the study data , placing a provisional ban upon all seven pesticides in the neonicotinoid family .
These chemicals may not be used in Germany until the manufacturers can supply enough data to convince the government that they are safe .
The seven provisionally banned pesticides are the clothianidin - based brands Poncho and Elado ; the imidacloprid - based brands Antarc , Chinook and Faibell ; methiocarb - based Mesurol ; and thiamethoxam - based Cruiser
Six of the seven products are made by Bayer , while Mesurol is manufactured by Syngenta .
Bayer ’s neonicotinoids have been blamed for killing honeybees before , most notably in France .
There the company ’s best - selling pesticide , imidacloprid , was banned from use on sunflower seeds in 1999 after being blamed for killing off a third of the country ’s honeybees .
In 2004 , France extended the ban to sweet corn seeds .
The government rejected Bayer ’s application for clothianidin use in France only a few months ago .
In North Dakota , a group of beekeepers is suing Bayer , alleging that imidacloprid was responsible for Colony Collapse Disorder ( CCD ) in that state in 1995 .
One - third of North Dakota honeybees died that year after imidacloprid was applied to rapeseed there .
Imidacloprid is marketed in France under the brand name Gaucho , but is also sold as Admire , Advantage , Confidor , Hachikusan , Kohinor , Merit , Premise , Prothor , and Winner .
Around the world , honeybee stocks are in decline , which scientists have warned could have devastating impacts on global food supplies .
A total of 80 percent of world food crops are primarily or exclusively pollinated by honeybees , amounting to 130 crops and $ 15 billion worth of food each year in the United States alone .
Yet two million honeybee colonies have been lost in the United States in recent years , with massive dieoffs also reported across Europe and in Taiwan , where 10 million bees recently disappeared over the course of only two weeks .
“ If nothing is done about it , the [ British ] honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years , ” warned U.K. Farming Minister Lord Rooker in 2007 .
While in many cases bees have actually been found dead , as in the Baden - Württemberg incident , beekeepers have been particularly alarmed by CCD , in which the bees simply vanish , leaving empty hives behind them .
Neonicotinoid pesticides have been suggested as a possible cause of CCD , with advocates of this theory noting that since the pesticide spreads through all plant tissues , bees might be exposed through the pollen of treated plants .
At least one study concluded that neonicotinoids are likely to become concentrated in bee hives in high levels , transported by contaminated pollen .
A number of studies have found that in low doses , neonicotinoids produce symptoms consistent with CCD .
Termites exposed to imidacloprid experienced disorientation and immune system failure , while bees exposed to low levels of the chemical experienced impaired communication , homing and foraging ability , flight activity , and olfactory discrimination and learning .

FireDogLake digs up a Mother Jones interview with McCain from 1998 .
Not only does McCain downplay bin Laden , but he also suggests that declaring war on terrorism might bog us down just like Vietnam .
[ MOTHER JONES ] :
You not only have had combat experience in Vietnam , but you were also a prisoner of war .
When you look at terrorism right now , with people like Osama bin Laden , do you have any reservations about watching strikes like that ?
[ JOHN MCCAIN ] :
You could say , Look , is this guy , Laden , really the bad guy that ’s depicted ?
Most of us have never heard of him before .
And where there is a parallel with Vietnam is :
What ’s plan B ?
What do we do next ?
We sent our troops into Vietnam to protect the bases .
Lyndon Johnson said ,
Only to protect the bases .
Next thing you know … .
Well , we ’ve declared to the terrorists that we ’re going to strike them wherever they live .
That ’s fine .
But what ’s next ?
That ’s where there might be some comparison .
Student drank himself to death by downing half - a- litre of vodka in just 20 minutes for a £ 40 bet
Drinking game : Jason Venezia
The mother of a student who drank himself to death in an end - of - term drinking game has attacked the ' heavy - drinking culture ' she says is casting a shadow over university life .
Jason Venezia , 19 , downed half a litre of vodka in just 20 minutes as he tried to win a bet with his friends .
The first - year psychology undergraduate had been promised £ 40 if he could drink the remaining three - quarters of the litre bottle - at a rate of one shot every 45 seconds .
But after drinking 15 shots and with a quarter of a litre still to go , Mr Venezia was left unable to stand or talk and his two friends put him to bed .
The friends - a man and a woman - checked on him every 15 minutes for two hours because they were worried he would choke on his own vomit .
But the Warwick University student was found dead the next afternoon of acute alcohol poisoning .
A post -mortem examination discovered he was over six times the legal drink - drive limit .
On Tuesday Mr Venezia 's parents , Ennio , who runs an IT business and Joan , both 53 , called for the legal drinking age to be raised from 18 to 21 .
Mrs Venezia said : ' If it was illegal to drink alcohol ( at his age ) , I do n't think Jason would have done it . '
She added that while the couple and their surviving son did not blame anyone for Mr Venezia 's death , they ' feel that there is an issue surrounding the heavy - drinking culture within university life which needs to be addressed ' .
Level - headed : Jason Venezia with friends on a night out
The teacher , from Solihull , West Midlands , added : ' Students need to know that their drinking games can lead to sudden death .
' The death of our son is an utterly devastating loss that we are struggling to comprehend and come to terms with .
' Jason was a warm , kind and loving son who had a cautious approach to life .
We regarded him as very level - headed .
Jason used to go out with his mates but he was not what I would consider a big drinker .
I had never seen him incoherently drunk . '
It just shows that if this could happen to Jason , it could happen to anyone .
People think that drinking only causes long - term damage - that 's what I thought until this happened .
' But binge - drinking is a serious problem , not just amongst university students but young people in general .'
Asked how she felt towards her son's two friends who challenged him to drink the vodka , Mrs Venezia said : ' I do n't blame them .
It is just how young people are .'
Campus :
The student was found dead in his room on the campus of Warwick University , above
The Coventry inquest heard how last May , Mr Venezia , whose father is Italian , had been drinking with the friends at their halls of residence .
The trio had consumed around a quarter of the bottle of vodka and then went out to a bar , where they had more shots of vodka , before returning home .
The two friends then agreed to pay him £ 20 each if he could drink the rest of the bottle .
Sean McGovern , the Coventry and Warwickshire coroner , said Jason had died from the misuse of alcohol and recorded a verdict of misadventure .
' I have dealt with many cases like this as a coroner and sadly this death comes as no surprise to me , ' he said .
A spokesman for the University of Warwick expressed his sympathies with the Venezias and said the university urged students to drink responsibly .
He said : ' This problem is not a university problem but a country - wide problem .
We can only hope that Jason 's death serves as a lesson to all young adults everywhere . '

Despite his wheelchair , and often because of it , Dr. Glen House has always enjoyed doing what he is n't supposed to .
Take the time he persuaded his neighbor in Colorado Springs , J.W. Roth , to join him on vacation in the ice fields of Taku , Alaska .
The trip entailed flying to a remote lodge in a tiny ski plane that was ill - equipped for disabled passengers : Boarding was via a rope ladder .
" They said no wheelchairs , " Roth recalls .
" So we signed up . "
That 2006 trip was a turning point for House and Roth .
The boarding process was dicey : Roth gave House a fireman 's lift up the plane 's ladder , which dangled over the ice .
" If I go down , you 're going with me , " House snarled on the way up .
But later the pair sat in the Taku lodge , wondering how they might bring such exhilarating experiences to other disabled people .
" They 're sick of doctors , " House told Roth .
" They want to know how to live forward with their conditions . "
That chat led to this year 's launch of Disaboom.com , a fast - growing social network aimed at the 50 million Americans with disabilities and their caregivers .
In a time of social - network fatigue , as Facebook and MySpace have spawned hundreds of bland imitators , Denver - based Disaboom is unique .
It focuses on a large , untapped audience eager to get answers and make connections , and one that advertisers had previously been unable to reach .
Like the entrepreneurs in the stories that follow , House demonstrates that disabilities are no obstacle in the brave new world of technology .
If anything , the determination they engender provides a clear business advantage .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the percentage of self - employed Americans with disabilities has grown from 12 % to 15 % since the dawn of the Web .
For the rest of us , the figure has stayed static at 8 % .
Your next competitor may just zoom past you in a wheelchair .
When House wants to get somewhere , he goes fast .
" That is how I ended up in the wheelchair , " he says .
During a ski vacation in Snowbird , Utah , House ignored the sign that read DANGER !
ROCK ! and at 20 became a quadriplegic from the pectorals down .
But House lost no time pursuing his next goal :
He began studying for medical school .
His Disaboom colleagues all have stories of his dangerously fast driving ; one had to pull him from his car when it skidded off the road into the Colorado snow .
House is the public face of Disaboom , writing most of the medical guides to the 40 disabilities the site covers and participating in its forums .
It does n't hurt that he and Roth founded the company last year just as the Fox drama House , which features a partially disabled doctor named Greg House , started winning over critics and viewers .
Glen House was not the inspiration for the show , although at least one patient insisted on his autograph anyway .
It helped that Roth , one of the founders of biotech firm AspenBio , came aboard as CEO .
Roth swiftly garnered $ 15 million in funding and began targeting advertisers .
By April , Disaboom had racked up $ 1 million in ad sales to corporate Godzillas such as Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) , Avis ( CAR , Fortune 500 ) , Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ , Fortune 500 ) , and T - Mobile , and had served up 23 million online ads .
Roth launched a sister site , Disaboomjobs.com , in an effort to address the 60 % unemployment rate among disabled Americans .
He even bought a disabled - dating site called lovebyrd.com .
" We do n't want Disaboom to smell like a doctor 's office , " Roth says .
" We want to deal with dating issues , sex issues , how to drive a fast car . "
Disaboom officially launched in January .
The main site now boasts 72,000 registered users , and the rate at which new users sign up is growing by 500 % a month .
In March presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain both launched profiles on the site .
Roth and House maintain folders full of thank - you e-mails , many from parents of disabled kids who did n't know where to turn until they found sympathy and suggestions from the Disaboom community .
The site is not without problems .
Roth decided to take Disaboom ( DSBO.OB ) public before its launch ; as of late August , the stock was trading at an anemic 50 cents a share , $ 1.30 off its 2007 high .
One disabled blogger at GearAbility.com complained that Disaboom jobs listed too few positions specifically for the handicapped , and that much of the content read like PR blurbs .
" There 's a lot of buzz about them , " says Jennifer Simpson , senior director of technology policy at the American Association of People With Disabilities , a lobbying group in Washington , D.C. " We talk about them all the time , but I do n't think they 're where they want to be . "
House and Roth are working on that .
They recently struck deals with the Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical School to license a reliable range of medical content .
With $ 4 million cash in hand , Disaboom 's stock slump is n't going to bite anytime soon .
The 39 employees on staff include three full - time " social marketers , " who write blogs and help promote the site on a range of popular websites such as Digg and Twitter .
" This is the tip of the iceberg , " says Roth at his conference table in a suburban Denver office park .
He already has plans to launch other social networks for underserved markets .
Neither he nor House will say more than that , but it seems likely that they 'll soon be doing something they were n't supposed to do , one more time .

According to legend , Genghis Khan lies buried somewhere beneath the dusty steppe of Northeastern Mongolia , entombed in a spot so secretive that anyone who made the mistake of encountering his funeral procession was executed on the spot .
Once he was below ground , his men brought in horses to trample evidence of his grave , and just to be absolutely sure he would never be found , they diverted a river to flow over their leader 's final resting place .
What Khan and his followers could n't have envisioned was that nearly 800 years after his death , scientists at UC San Diego 's Center for Interdisciplinary Science in Art , Architecture and Archaeology ( CISA3 ) would be able to locate his tomb using advanced visualization technologies whose origins can be traced back to the time of the Mongolian emperor himself .
" As outrageous as it might sound , we 're looking for the tomb of Genghis Khan , " says Dr. Albert Yu - Min Lin , an affiliated researcher for CISA3 .
" Genghis Khan was one of the most exceptional men in all of history , but his life is too often dismissed as being that of a bloodthirsty warrior .
Few people in the West know about his legacy — that he united warring tribes of Mongolia and merged them into one , that he introduced the East to the West making explorations like those of Marco Polo possible , that he tried to create a central world currency , that he introduced a written language to the Mongol people and created bridges that we still use today within the realm of international relations .
" But as great a man he was , there are few clues and no factual evidence about Genghis Khan 's burial , which is why we need to start using technology to solve this mystery . "
Lin and several colleagues — including Professor Maurizio Seracini , the director of CISA3 and the man behind the search for Leonardo da Vinci 's lost " Battle of Anghiari " painting — are hoping to use advanced visualization and analytical technologies available at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology ( Calit2 ) to pinpoint Khan 's tomb and conduct a non-invasive archaeological analysis of the area where he is believed to be buried .
Lin plans to work with Seracini to establish a position at UCSD that will allow him to spearhead the three - year Valley of the Khans project , which will require $ 700,000 in funding for eight researchers ( including all expedition costs ) .

Khan 's grave is presumably in a region bordered by Mongolia 's Onon River and the Khan khentii mountains near his birthplace in Khentii Aimag , and some experts believe his sons and other family members were later buried beside him .
The researchers , however , have little additional information to go on .
Directly following Khan 's death in 1227 , the area around his tomb was deemed forbidden by the emperor 's guards , and later in the 20th century , by strict Russian occupation , which prohibited Mongolians from even talking about Genghis Khan because they felt it might lead to nationalist uprising .
Only since the 1990s have researchers been allowed in the area , and several other research teams have tried unsuccessfully to locate the tomb .
Lin hopes of success are based on his access to unparalleled technology at Calit2 and CISA3 to pinpoint the area where Khan might have been laid to rest , find the tomb itself and then develop a virtual recreation of it using various methods of spectral and digital imaging .
Explains Lin :
" If you have a large burial , that 's going to have an impact on the landscape .
To find Khan 's tomb , we 'll be using remote sensing techniques and satellite imagery to take digital pictures of the ground in the surrounding region , which we 'll be able to display on Calit2's 287 - million pixel HIPerSpace display wall .
But we also want to make this an interactive research project and get the public involved .
One of our ideas is to utilize something like the International Space Station 's ' EarthCam ' program at UCSD , which recruits middle school students to control a satellite camera and take pictures of the earth .
We 'd have them do the same thing , only they'd be taking pictures of the area where Genghis ' tomb might be located . "
Lin says another approach would be to combine social networking with visualization techniques to replicate something like the online " Find Steve Fossett " project , which enlisted members of the general public to flag anomalous satellite images in the hopes that they could locate the missing adventurer .
" Once we 've narrowed down this region in Mongolia to a certain area , " Lin continues , " we 'll use techniques such as ground penetrating radar , electromagnetic induction and magnetometry to produce non-destructive , non-invasive surveys .
We 'll then work with people in UCSD 's electrical engineering department to develop visual algorithms that will allow us to create a high - resolution , 3 - D representation of the site . "
Notably , these computer - based technologies are modern evolutions of moveable type and the printing press — innovations that historian Jack Weatherford argues were spread by way of the Mongols as they conquered parts of Europe ( Chinese printing technologies predated Gutenberg 's printing press by several hundred years ) .
Lin speculates that remnants of those international conquests might even turn up in Khan 's tomb , but , he adds , " The process of doing an archaeological dig is up to the Mongolian government . "

Lin says he 's hoping to collaborate with the Mongolian government and national universities , through the help of Amaraa and Bayarsihan Baljinnayam — siblings from what he endearingly calls his " Mongolian family . "
They will assist with language interpretation and expedition coordination , and most importantly , local media and political support — connections that will prove very useful as Lin navigates through the often complex arena of international relations .
Noting that his project team also includes San Diego State University Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry William G. Tong , UCSD Field Systems Engineer Nathan Ricklin , UCSD Computer Vision Engineer Shay Har - Noy and Independent Engineering Geologist Charles Ince , Lin says he sees parallels between the collaborative work he 's doing with CISA3 and Genghis ' own push to adapt to new technologies .
" He took the best resources of entire world — whether weaponry or medicine -- and adopted those technologies into his own methodology .
We 're trying to implement that same adaptation to many disciplines into our own work .
We 're taking the great work that 's already been done in archaeology and further developing it by using technologies from other disciplines -- computer vision , social networking , electrical engineering — while at the same time never forgetting fundamentals of historical search .
Despite the technologies and expertise available to him , Lin says he is well aware of the great challenges the project poses .
" One consistent fact is that there is no fact , " he admits .
" It 's a story of secrets upon secrets and myths upon myths .
" If I could meet Genghis Khan today , I would ask how he would have wanted to be remembered in history , " Lin muses .
" The fact that he died in his bed surrounded by people who loved him and never had a single General turn his back on him , the fact that the loyalty of his people is so sound it can be heard across the world — these are the marks of one of the most impressive military heroes of all time .
This is an example of a leader who was ruthless , strict , disciplined , and in a lot of ways , extremely honorable .
If he was able to rewrite his own history , I wonder how he'd want it heard . "
A new survey conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service reveals that populations of Alaska pollock , the world ’s largest food fishery , have dropped 50 percent since last year .
Pollock is America ’s most ubiquitous seafood product , found in McDonald ’s fish sandwiches , frozen fish sticks , fish and chips , and imitation crabmeat .
The assessment revealed that Bering Sea pollock stocks have declined to their lowest level on record ( pdf ) a startling development for a fishery NMFS ’ chief scientist recently called “ one of the most successfully managed species in the world ” and that has earned a Marine Stewardship Council certification .
In December , the North Pacific Fishery Management Council will set the new pollock catch limits for 2009 .
Scientists and conservationists have warned that unless the Council reduces fishing pressure on pollock , a vital forage species for fur seals , whales , and endangered Steller sea lions , the entire Bering Sea ecosystem could be in jeopardy of collapse .
This would prove devastating for the state ’s commercial fishermen and traditional coastal communities that depend on a healthy ocean for their livelihoods .
“ Economic pressures to keep on fishing at such high levels have overwhelmed common sense , ” said Dr. Jeremy Jackson , Director of the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography .
“ With the huge uncertainties inherent in fisheries models , a far more precautionary , ecosystem - based approach is required .
Otherwise , fisheries managers are gambling with the health of our oceans and coastal communities . ”
Over the past several years , the pollock fishery has experienced poor juvenile survival rates and dwindling populations , forcing the council to reduce harvests in the past two fishing seasons .
But experts say these actions have been inadequate , failing to prevent further declines .
In order to restore the fishery ’s health , the allowable catch must be cut in half , fishing on spawning populations suspended , and marine reserves established to protect critical habitats .
“ We are on the cusp of one of the largest fishery collapses in history , ” said John Hocevar , Greenpeace Oceans Campaign Director .
“ It may still be possible to prevent disaster , but the North Pacific Fishery Management Council must take swift and decisive action when they meet in December . ”

Crude oil futures price per barrel , 12 months .
GASOLINE PRICES GASOLINE PRICES State - by - state gasoline averages from AAA VIENNA ( AP ) 
An OPEC attempt to stem the free - fall in oil prices fizzled Friday with crude futures dropping below $ 65 a barrel to lows last seen 15 months ago on world economic fears , despite the 13 - member group 's decision to slash production by a daily 1.5 million barrels .
Oil 's steep plunge has sent the price of a gallon of gasoline below year - ago levels for the first time in 2008 .
A gallon of regular gas fell 4 cents overnight to a new national average of $ 2.78 , according to auto club AAA , the Oil Price Information Service and Wright Express .
That 's nearly a dollar less than what was paid last month and 4 cents below gas prices one year ago on Oct. 24 .
Gas prices are off from their July peak by about a third compared with the price of crude , which has been more than halved .
There is a lag between the two prices as oil being traded now will not be delivered until next month .
That oil must be refined , or turned into gasoline , and then shipped to filling stations .
Oil 's imperviousness to production cutbacks — the most potent weapon in the OPEC arsenal — reflected the cartel 's diminishing control over prices .
And the language of an OPEC statement announcing the cut reflected how seriously it viewed the erosion of its revenues , as did the unusually short deliberations leading to the decision .
" Oil prices have witnessed a dramatic collapse — unprecedented in speed and magnitude , " said the 13 - nation organization .
" This slowdown in demand is serving to exacerbate the situation in a market which has been oversupplied with crude for some time . "
It also warned of further hard times ahead for suppliers , saying " the fall in demand will deepen " in the coming months .
In more orderly economic times , any Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries move to reduce output led to an upward spike on fears that demand would outstrip supply .
But Friday 's oil market reaction reflected present realities ; with the financial vortex sucking the U.S. and other major consumers into recession — and even China 's and India 's booming economies slowing — even less oil at lower prices will have trouble finding a buyer .
" The power to influence oil prices is moving farther and farther away from OPEC , " said oil trader and analyst Stephen Schork .
" Everyone thought China and India would go on buying oil forever , but that 's not the case .
" The demand is no longer there , " said Schork .
" I think people fooled themselves when they said emerging markets could weather a U.S. downturn .
That 's yanked OPEC right out of its role as the key player . "
Steeply dropping world stock markets that reflected fear of a global recession proved the dominant influence on oil markets , sidelining any OPEC hopes that its steepest output cut in five years would remedy crude 's plunge .
Major European bourses that were down more than 10 % during the day improved by closing time but still suffered losses as high as 5 % .
Asian stocks also closed sharply down .
Russia 's two exchanges were shut down early because of double - digit losses and officials said they would n't resume trading until Tuesday .
On Wall Street , the Dow Jones industrials were down sharply also .
Benchmark crude futures were trading at $ 64.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after falling as low as US $ 62.85 earlier in the day , shortly after OPEC announced its cut , to take effect starting next month .
Crude prices have now fallen 56 % from the highs reached in July , and more than $ 41 per barrel in just the last 30 days .
Reflecting the huge demand slump facing OPEC , a U.S. Department of Transportation report released Friday showed the largest monthly decline in miles driven in 66 years .
Americans drove 5.6 % less , or 15 billion fewer miles , in August 2008 compared with August 2007 — the biggest single monthly decline since the data was first collected regularly in 1942 .
In terms of overall use , the latest weekly report from the U.S. Department of Energy shows that crude demand has fallen in 38 of the past 42 weeks .
U.S. demand is down nearly 10 % during the past four weeks year on year .
The figures are significant because the U.S. still consumes one out of every four barrels of oil produced .
The 11 OPEC nations under quotas are already producing more than their allotments — overall output from them is about 300,000 barrels a day past the stated OPEC daily target of about 29 million barrels .
So if they stop overproduction , and comply with the 1.5 - million cut agreed on Friday , OPEC should end up producing about 1.8 million barrels less a day .
But against increasingly alarming economic developments not only in America but in most corners of the world , even an OPEC cut closer to 2 million barrels a day is unlikely to turn near - term prices around .
The cut reflected a compromise between OPEC members such as Iran and Venezuela , which were looking to yank up to 2 million barrels a day off the market , and oil powerhouse Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies that are more open to U.S. appeals for plentiful crude on the market .
It also tried to balance OPEC members ' concerns over eroding revenue with demands from the U.S. and other major consumers for affordable crude .
But the U.S. criticized the move .
" It has always been our view that the value of commodities , including oil , should be determined in open , competitive markets , and not by these kinds of anti-market production decisions , " deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said Friday .
" The high oil prices from the past year contributed to the slowdown in demand and the subsequent downturn in the economy , and we would ask that everyone keep that in mind going forward . "
Still , OPEC officials left no doubt that they were ready to slice deeper quickly if Friday 's decision does not end the price free fall .
Friday 's meeting was called unexpectedly in response to prices that have entered a tailspin since their historic high of nearly $ 150 in July .
OPEC President Chakib Khelil said OPEC was ready to convene another emergency session before its next planned gathering in December in Algeria " if there are further decisions that have to be made " on slashing prices .
" It 's clear that the ministers are attempting to underpin at $ 60 a barrel , " said James R. Crawford an analyst with Inter Emirates .
" But where the market will settle remains open . "
In an appeal to Russia and other major oil exporters outside OPEC , the oil ministers meeting in Vienna indirectly urged them not to undercut their efforts to prop up prices .
" OPEC cannot be expected to bear alone the burden of restoring equilibrium , " said the statement .
OPEC Secretary - General Abdullah El - Badri said before a meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Wednesday that he would not ask Russia for oil production cuts as global prices fall .
Some analysts have said Russia was unlikely to agree to production cuts , given that it already is battling with falling output as West Siberian oil fields mature .
But others spoke of behind - the - scenes negotiations between Russia and OPEC on the issue .
El - Badri took pains Friday to emphasize that OPEC 's move was predicated by a need not to raise prices but to put a floor underneath them .
Iran , Venezuela and other OPEC members have suggested that , for them , selling oil under US $ 80 was a loss - maker , and Iraq said Thursday it would have to rethink next year 's national budget if prices remain under that level .
El - Badri said OPEC could not be expected to solve the world 's financial crisis — something the organization did not cause and could not cure .
" OPEC cannot bail out the problems of others , " he said .

Medieval & Renaissance Sword Forms and Companion Implements
In the continuing effort to bring greater learning and scholarship to the serious study and practice of European weaponry , ARMA , as the premier Internet site for Medieval and Renaissance martial arts , presents the following general definitions .
This brief list is intended to aid studnets in study and dispel some of the many myths and misconceptions surrounding the subject .
Medieval Swords
Medieval swords existed in great varieties over a number of centuries .
Both experimentation and specialization in design was constant .
But certain common characteristics can describe the " generic " medieval sword as a long , wide , straight , double - edged blade with a simple cross - guard ( or " cruciform " hilt ) .
It might be designed for one or two - hands .
The typical form was a single hand weapon used for hacking , shearing cuts and also for limited thrusting .
This style developed essentially from Celtic , Germanic , Anglo - Saxon , and late Roman ( the spatha ) forms .
The Viking and early Frankish forms ( the " spata " ) are also considered to be more direct ancestors .
Medieval swords can be classified ( typically by hilt design ) into a great many categories by curators , collectors , and military historians .
However , students & re-creationists today should prefer the actual historical terms .
At the time , long bladed weapons were simply referred to as " swords " , or for the longer ones often a " sword of war " , " war - sword " ( French Espée du Guerre or Epee du Guerre ) , or even a " long - sword " .
Various languages might call them by schwert , svard , suerd , swerd , espada , esapadon , or epee .
When later worn on the belt by mounted knights they might be called an Arming - sword .
Arming - swords were also considered " riding - swords " ( also parva ensis or epee courte ) .
It is this single - hand form which is so closely associated with the idea of the " knightly sword " ( c. 1300 ) .
The challenge of armor in the Age - of - plate , forced many blades ( both single - hand and longer ) to be made narrower and pointier , but also thicker and more rigid .
Ffrom at least the late 1300s in England , a single - hand blade of this form was referred as a " short swerde " .
In 15th century Germany it was the Kurczen swert .
At this same time , as a result of the increased use of thrusting techniques some blades adopted guards with knuckle - bars , finger - rings , and / or sides - rings which lead to the compound - hilt .
In later Elizabethan times , older one - handed medieval type blades became known as " short - swords " while the larger variety were still referred to as " long - swords " .
The term " short sword " was used later by 19th century collectors to refer to any style of " shorter " one - handed swords typically from ancient times on .
The Broadsword A term popularly misapplied as a generic synonym for medieval swords or any long , wide military blade .
The now popular misnomer " broadsword " in reference to Medieval blades actually originated with collectors in the early 19th century - although many mistranslations and misinterpretations of Medieval literature during the 19th & 20th centuries have inserted the word broadsword in place of other terms .
They described swords of earlier ages as being " broader " than their own contemporary thinner ones .
Many 17th - 19th century blades such as spadroons , cutlasses , and straight sabers are classed as broadswords as are other closed hilt military swords .
The weapon known as the true broadsword is in fact a form of short cutlass .
The term " broadsword " does not appear in English military texts from the 1570s - 1630s and noes not show up in inventories of sword types from the 1630's , and likely came into use sometime between 1619 and 1630 .
Descriptions of swords as " broad " before this time are only incidental and the word " broad " is used as an adjective in the same way " sharp " or " large " would be applied .
Leading arms curators almost always list the broadsword specifically as a close - hilted military sword from the second half of the 17th century .
Those cage and basket hilted blades used by cavalry starting in the 1640's were in form , " broadswords " .
During this time a gentleman 's blade had become the slender small - sword , whereas the military used various cutting blades .
Today , arms collectors , museum curators theatrical - fighters , and fantasy - gamers have made the word broadsword a common , albeit blatantly historically incorrect , term for the Medieval sword .
Long - Swords
The various kinds of long bladed Medieval swords that had handles long enough to be used in two hands were deemed long - swords ( German Langenschwert / Langes Swert or Italian spada longa ) .
Long - swords , war - swords , or great swords are characterized by having both a long grip and a long blade .
We know at the time that Medieval warriors did distinguished war - swords or great - swords ( " grant espees " or " grete swerdes " ) from " standard " swords in general , but long - swords were really just those larger versions of typical one - handed swords , except with stouter blades .
They were " longer swords " , as opposed to single - hand swords , or just " swords " .
They could be used on foot or mounted and sometimes even with a shield .
The term war - sword from the 1300 's referred to larger swords that were carried in battle .
They were usually kept on the saddle as opposed to worn on the belt .
A 15th century Burgundian manual refers to both " great and small swords " .
As a convenient classification , long - swords include great - swords , bastard - swords , and estocs .
In the 1200s in England blunt swords for non-lethal tournaments were sometimes known as " arms of courtesy " .
There is a reference to an English tournament of 1507 in which among the events contestants are challenged to " 8 strookes with Swords rebated " .
Wooden training weapons were sometimes called wasters in the 1200's or batons in the 1300's and 1400's .
Knightly combat with blunt or " foyled " weapons for pleasure was known as à plaisance , combat to the death was à lóuutrance .
Great - Swords
Those blades long and weighty enough to demand a double grip are great - swords .
They are infantry swords which cannot be used in a single - hand .
Originally the term " great - sword " ( gret sord , grete swerde , or grant espée ) , only meant a war - sword ( long - sword ) , but it has now more or less come to mean a sub-class of those larger long - swords / war - swords that are still not true two - handers .
They were even known as Grete Swerdes of Warre or Grans Espees de Guerre .
Although they are " two hand " swords , great - swords not are the specialized weapons of later two - handed swords .
They are the swords that are antecedents to the even larger Renaissance versions .
Great - swords are also the weapons often depicted in various German sword manuals .
A Medieval great - sword might also be called a " twahandswerds " or " too honde swerd " .
Whereas other long - swords could be used on horseback and some even with shields , great swords however were infantry weapons only .
Their blades might be flat and wide or later on , more narrow and hexagonal or diamond shaped .
These larger swords capable of facing heavier weapons such as pole - arms and larger axes were devastating against lighter armors .
Long , two - handed swords with narrower , flat hexagonal blades and thinner tips ( such as the Italian " spadone " ) were a response to plate - armor .
Against plate armor such rigid , narrow , and sharply pointed swords are not used in the same chop and cleave manner as with flatter , wider long - swords and great swords .
Instead , they are handled with tighter movements that emphasize their thrusting points and allow for greater use of the hilt .
Those of the earlier parallel - edged shape are known more as war - swords , while later the thicker , tapering , sharply pointed form were more often called bastard - swords .
One type of long German sword , the " Rhenish Langenschwert " , from the Rhenish city of Cologne , had a blade of some 4 feet and an enormous grip of some 14 to 16 inches long , not including the pommel .
Bastard Swords
In the early 1400's ( as early as 1418 ) a form of long - sword often with specially shaped grips for one or two hands , became known as an Espée Bastarde or " bastard sword " .
The term may derive not form the blade length , but because bastard - swords typically had longer handles with special " half - grips " which could be used by either one or both hands .
In this sense they were neither a one - handed sword nor a true great - sword / two - handed sword , and thus not a member of either " family " of sword .
Evidence shows the their blade were typically tapered .
Since newer types of shorter swords were coming into use , the term " bastard - sword " came to distinguish this form of long - sword .
Bastard - swords typically had longer handles with special " half - grips " which could be used by either one or both hands .
These handles have recognizable " waist " and " bottle " shapes ( such grips were later used on the Renaissance two - handed sword ) .
The unique bastard - sword half - grip was a versatile and practical innovation .
Although , once again classification is not clear since the term " bastard - sword " appears to have not been entirely exclusive to those swords with so - called " hand - and - a - half " handles as older styles of long - sword were still in limited use .
Bastard - swords varied and they might have either a flat blade or narrow hexagonal one for fighting plate - armor .
Some were intended more for cutting while others were better for thrusting .
Bastard swords continued to be used by knights and men-at - arms into the 1500's .
Their hilt style leads toward the shorter cut & thrust sword forms of the Renaissance .
Strangely , in the early Renaissance the term bastard - sword was also sometimes used to refer to single - hand arming - swords with compound - hilts .
A form of German arming sword with a bastard - style compound hilt was called a " Reitschwert " ( " cavalry sword " ) or a " Degen " ( " knight 's sword " ) .
Although these might have been forms of single - hand estoc .
The familiar modern term " hand - and - a - half " was more or less coined to describe bastards swords specifically .
The term " hand - and - a - half sword " is often used in reference to long - swords is not historical and is sometimes misapplied to other swords ( although during the late 1500 's , long after such blades fell out of favor , some German forms of this phrase are believed to have been used ) .
While there is no evidence of the term hand - and - a - half having been used during the Middle Ages , either in English or other languages , it does appear in the 16th century .
In his 1904 bibliography of Spanish texts , D. Enrique de Leguina gives a 1564 reference to una espada estoque de mano y media , and a 1594 reference to una espada de mano y media .
In the Ragionamento , the unpublished appendix to his 1580 , Traite d Escrime ( Fencing Treatise ) , Giovanni Antonio Lovino describes one sword as una spada di una mano et mana et meza ( literally hand and a half sword ) which he distinguishes from the much larger spada da due mani or two - handed sword ( the immense Renaissance weapon ) .
The term spadone was used by Fiore Dei Liberi in 1410 to refer to a tapering long - sword and Camillo Agrippa in 1550 called the spadone a war sword .
Later it was defined by John Florio in his 1598 Italian - English dictionary as a long or two - hand sword .
Two - handed Swords
The term " two - hander " or " two - handed sword " ( espée a deure mains or spada da due mani ) was in use as early as 1400 and is really a classification of sword applied both to Medieval great - swords as well Renaissance swords ( the true two - handed swords ) .
Such weapons saw more use in the later Middle Ages and early Renaissance .
Technically , true two - handed swords ( epee 's a deux main ) were actually Renaissance , not Medieval weapons .
They are really those specialized forms of the later 1500 - 1600's , such as the Swiss / German Dopplehander ( " double - hander " ) or Bidenhander ( " both - hander " ) or Zweihander / Zweyhander are relatively modern not historical terms .
English ones were sometimes referred to as " slaughterswords " after the German Schlachterschwerter ( " battle swords " ) .
These weapons were used primarily for fighting against pike - squares where they would hack paths through lobbing the tips off the poles .
In Germany , England , and elsewhere schools also taught their use for single - combat .
In True two - handed swords have compound - hilts with side - rings and enlarged cross -guards of up to 12 inches .
Most have small , pointed lugs or flanges protruding from their blades 4 - 8 inches below their guard .
These parrierhaken or " parrying hooks " act almost as a secondary guard for the ricasso to prevent other weapons from sliding down into the hands .
They make up for the weapon 's slowness on the defence and can allow another blade to be momentarily trapped or bound up .
They can also be used to strike with .
The most well - known of " twa handit swordis " is the Scottish Claymore ( Gaelic for " claidheamh - more " or great - sword ) which developed out of earlier Scottish great - swords with which they are often compared .
They were used by the Scottish Highlanders against the English in the 1500's .
Another sword of the same name is the later Scots basket - hilt broadsword ( a relative of the Renaissance Slavic - Italian schiavona ) whose hilt completely enclosed the hand in a cage - like guard .
Both swords have come to be known by the same name since the late 1700's .
Certain wave or flame - bladed two - handed swords have come to be known by collectors as flamberges , although this is inaccurate .
Such swords developed in the early - to - mid 1500's and are more appropriately known as flammards or flambards ( the German Flammenschwert ) .
The flamberge was also a term later applied to certain types of rapiers .
The wave - blade form is visually striking but really no more effective in its cutting than a straight one .
There were also huge two - handed blades known as " bearing - swords " or " parade - swords " ( Paratschwert ) , weighing up to 12 or even 15 pounds and which were intended only for carrying in ceremonial processions and parades .
In the 1500s there were also a few rare single - edged two - handers such as the Swiss - German Grosse Messer or later sometimes called a Zwiehand sabel .
The Estoc A form of long , rigid , pointed , triangular or square bladed and virtually edgeless sword designed for thrusting into plate - armor was the estoc .
Called a stocco in Italian , estoque in Spanish , a tuck in English , Panzerstecher or Dreiecker in German , and a kanzer in Eastern Europe .
They were used with two hands and similar to great - swords ( but were unrelated to later rapiers ) .
They were used in two hands with the second hand often gripping the blade .
Some were sharpened only near the point and others might have one or two large round hand guards .
Rapiers are sometimes mistakenly referred to as tucks , and there is evidence that during the Renaissance some rapiers may have been referred to as such by the English .
In French " estoc " itself means to thrust .
The Claymore Identified with the Scot 's symbol of the warrior , the term " Claymore " is Gaelic for " claidheamh - more " ( great sword ) .
This two - handed broadsword was used by the Scottish Highlanders against the English in the 16th century and is often confused with a Basket - hilt " broadsword " ( a relative of the Italian schiavona ) whose hilt completely enclosed the hand in a cage - like guard .
Both swords have come to be known by the same name since the late 1700's .
The Falchion A rarer form of sword that was little more than a meat cleaver , possibly even a simple kitchen and barnyard tool adopted for war .
Indeed , it may come from a French word for a sickle , " fauchon " .
It can be seen in Medieval art being used against lighter armors by infidels as well as footman and even knights .
The weapon is entirely European and not derived from eastern sources .
More common in the Renaissance , it was considered a weapon to be proficient with in addition to the sword .
The falchion is similar to the German Dusack ( or Dusagge ) , and has been dubiously suggested as possibly related to the Dark Age long knife , " seax " ( scramanseax ) , and even later curved blades such as sabres ( or sabels ) .
Similar to an Arabian " scimitar " , the falchion 's wide , heavy blade weighted more towards the point could deliver tremendous blows .
Several varieties were known , most all with single edges and rounded points .
A later Italian falchion with a slender sabre - like blade was called a " storta " or a " malchus " .
Another similar weapon in German was the saber or machete - like Messer .
Large two - hand versions , called Grosse Messers , with straight or curved single - edged blades were known by 1500 .
Renaissance Swords Cut & Thrust Swords
The term " cut and thrust sword " is a general one which can be applied to a whole range of blade forms ( field swords , side swords , arming swords ) .
However , the Renaissance military sword is generally characterized by a swept or compound - hilt , a narrow cut - and - thrust blade with stronger cross-section , and tapering tip .
A direct descendant of the medieval knightly sword , the cut and thrust sword was used by lightly armed footmen as well as civilians in the 16th and 17th centuries .
During this time they were employed against a range of armored and unarmored opponents .
They were popular for sword & buckler and sword & dagger fighting .
They utilized an innovative one - handed grip fingering the ricasso ( a dull portion of blade just above the guard ) .
Renaissance cut & thrust swords should not be referred to as " early Renaissance swords " since they were actually in use throughout the period .
Military and civilian forms of them existed before , during and after the development of the rapier .
For example , similar blades ( with and without ricassos and compound hilts ) saw use in the English Civil War and even later .
They should also not be referred to as " sword - rapiers " or " early rapiers " , although in a sense , some of them were .
Renaissance cut & thrust swords were their own distinct sword type .
Although sometimes considered a " transition " form , this is inaccurate as they were both the ancestor and contemporary of the rapier for which they are often misidentified .
Some forms of cage & basket hilts blades are occasionally referred to as " riding swords " by collectors and curators , and sometimes even as " broadswords " .
However , the 16th century Italians did sometimes distinguish between spada da cavallo , or a blade for horsemen , spada da fante , an infantry sword for foot - soldiers , and later spada da lato ( side sword ) , a civilian cut - and - thrust sword , a form of which only later became the rapier ( in modern times sometimes called a stricia ) .
The Back - Sword
The back - sword or Backe swerd was a less - common form of single - edged renaissance military cut & thrust blade with a compound - hilt ( side - rings or anneus , finger - rings , knuckle - bar , etc. ) .
Most popular in England with a buckler or target from at least the 1520s , it was long enough for both mounted and infantry and favored because its single - edge designed allowed for a superior cutting blow .
It was also popular in Germany .
Back - swords may be related to later single - edged European blade forms and came in a variety of hilts and lengths .
They also include later Hangers and hunting swords , as well as Mortuary - hilt and Walloon - hilt broadswords .
The Schiavona A form of agile Renaissance cut & thrust sword with a decorative cage - hilt and distinctive " cat- head " pommel .
So named for the Schiavoni or Venetian Doges Slavonic mercenaries and guards of the 1500s who favored the weapon .
They are usually single edged back - swords but may also be wide or narrow double edged blades .
Some have ricasso for a fingering grip while others have thumb - rings .
The Schiavona is often considered the antecedent to other cage hilt swords such as the Scottish basket - hilted " broadsword " .
The Katzbalger A form of one - handed sword with a shorter blade and " S " shaped guard .
It was favored by pikemen and the Swiss / German Landesknetchs for fighting close in amidst pike - squares .
Many were originally longer , wider blades which were cut down and remounted .
The name likely derives from a word associated with cat - gut or cat - skin .
THeir lengths varied from short to mid-sized .
The Rapier Popular in the late 16th and early 17th centuries , the rapier was a dueling weapon whose form was developed from cut and thrust swords .
Its use was more brutal and forceful than the light sport fencing that we know of today .
Originally , starting about 1470 , any civilian sword was often referred to as simply a " rapier " , but it quickly took on the meaning of a slender , civilian thrusting sword .
There is also an English document from the 1500's that uses the term " rapier - sword " for advising courtiers how to be armed , indicating the understanding that there were new slender blades coming into civilian use .
Eventually developing into an edgeless , ideal thrusting weapon , the quick , innovative rapier superseded the military cut & thrust sword for personal duel and urban self - defense .
Being capable of making only limited lacerations , earlier varieties of rapier are still often confused with the cut and thrust swords which gave gestation to their method .
As a civilian weapon of urban self - defense , a true rapier was a tip - based thrusting sword that used stabbing and piercing , not slashing and cleaving .
True rapier blades ranged from early flatter triangular blades to thicker , narrow hexagonal ones .
Rapier hilts range from swept styles , to later dishes and cups .
It had no true cutting edge such as with military swords for war .
The " Sword Rapier "
The so - called " sword - rapier " is actually a term invented by collectors in the last century and is not a historical one .
Increasingly , many Renaissance cut & thrust swords are mistakenly labeled as such .
With the ascendancy of rapiers over swords in personal duel and private quarrel , there were many attempts to combine the slashing and cleaving potential of a traditional military sword with the quick , agile thrust of a dueling rapier .
This lead to a great deal of experimental blade forms , many of which were dismal failures with neither the cutting power of wider swords , nor the speed and lightness of true rapiers .
Made to do both , they typically did neither very well and few examples of these blades forms survive .
They do appear to have been popular with high - ranking military officers during the mid 17th century ( who of course , would be among those least likely to engage in battlefield hand - to- hand combat ) .
They are also sometimes mistakenly called " cutting rapiers " or assumed to be some form of " transition " blade between swords and rapiers .
The Flamberge An unusual waved - bladed rapier popular with officers and upper classes during the 1600s .
It was considered to look both fashionable and deadly as well as erroneously believed to inflict a more deadly wound .
When parrying with the flamberge , the opponent 's sword was slowed slightly as it passed along the length .
It also created a disconcerting vibration in the other blade .
The term flamberge was also used later to describe a dish - hilted rapier with a normal straight blade .
Certain wave or flame - bladed two - handed swords have also come to be known by collectors as " flamberges " , although this is inaccurate .
Such swords are more appropriately known as " flammards " or " flambards " .
The Small Sword Sometimes known as a " court - sword " , a " walking - sword " , or " town - sword " , small - swords developed in the late Renaissance as a personal dueling tool and weapon of self - defense .
Most popular in the 1700's it is sometimes confused with the rapier .
It consisted almost exclusively of a sharp pointed metal rod with a much smaller guard and finger - rings .
Its blade was typically a hollow triangular shape and was much thicker at the hilt .
Most had no edge at all , and were merely rigid , pointed , metal rods .
They were popular with the upper classes especially as decorative fashion accessories , worn like jewelry .
In a skilled hand the small sword was an effective and deadly instrument .
Until the early 1800s it continued to be used even against older rapiers and even some cutting swords .
It is the small - sword rather than the rapier which leads to the epee and foil of modern sport fencing .
Curved Blades
While it is the straight - bladed cruciform sword style that for both war and duel was perfected in Europe as no where else , curved swords were hardly unknown .
Many forms were known from the ancient convex - bladed Greek kopis and Iberian falcatta , to the laengsaex curved Viking blade , as well as the short - sword / long - knife seax or scramsax .
There is also the Medieval falchion and the German curved Messer , Grossmessr , and bohemian Dusask The Italians used the curved storta , the straight bladed but curved - edge braquemart and the curved badelair ( baudelair , bazelair , or basilaire ) as well as the short curved braquet .
Finally , wide varieties of sabers , sabres , sabels , and cutlasses were used from at least the mid-1500s .
Indigenous European curved sword forms such as the Czech tesak , Polish tasak , and Russian tisak were used since at least the 7th century .
Daggers
A common long dagger , " poignard " ( poniard ) , or " pugnale " was a favored companion , carried en-suite with a sword or rapier as a backup weapon or even on its own .
The dagger was lightweight , deadly , and elegant .
Used primarily as a defensive weapon , dagger fighting was an art itself .
Technically , a poniard was square or triangular shaped with no edge , while a dagger had a knife - like blade .
Generally , daggers in the Middle Ages were employed point down , pommel up , while those in the Renaissance were used point up with the thumb placed on the hilt .
Many later daggers for use with rapiers had elaborate guards and were specially designed for trapping and parrying .
Bucklers
The buckler ( or Italian " rondash " or " bochiero " ) was a small , agile hand - shield .
Used since medieval times , bucklers were round or even square , approx .
8 - 20 " and made of metal , wood , or metal trimmed wood .
A single handle ( or enarme ) was used to hold it in a fist grip and smack , deflect or punch at blows and thrusts .
The edge could also be used to strike and block .
Some had long metal spikes on the front to attack with .
On some later bucklers metal hooks or bars were placed on the front to trap the point of an opponent 's rapier .
More popular for a method of 16th sword & buckler fighting , they declined in use during the early 17th century as they were inconvenient for urban wear and faster rapiers outmaneuvered them .
The Targe A targe / targa ( or Italian " rondella " ) was a small wooden shield with a leather cover and leather or metal trim .
Some were also covered with metal studs or spikes .
Unlike bucklers , targes were worn on the arm as with typical shields .
They were also usually flat rather than convex .
Though associated with the Scots , the word " targe " actually comes from small " targets " placed on archery practice dummies .
Some forms of medium sized steel shields from the Renaissance are often classed as targes .
In England in the 1500s & 1600s , " target " was a common term for any small shield .
Sword Parts
Hilt -
The upper portion of a sword consisting of the cross-guard , handle / grip , and pommel ( most Medieval swords have a straight cross or cruciform - hilt ) .
Called the Handhabe in German .
In Old French the crosspiece was called helz , the grip called poing , the pommel called pom , and the handle might be bound with metal rings called mangon .
Cross -
The typically straight bar or " guard " of a Medieval sword , also called a " cross - guard " .
A Renaissance term for the straight or curved cross-guard was the quillons ( possibly from an old French or Latin term for a type of reed ) .
Fiore Dei Liberi in 1410 referred to it as the crucibus .
Fillipo Vadi in the 1480s termed it the cross - guard or " crosses " , Elza term .
Called the Gehiltz or Gehultz in German .
Called the Kreuz in German and Croce in Italian .
Quillions : A Renaissance term for the two cross-guards ( forward and back ) whether straight or curved .
It is likely from an old French or Latin term for a reed .
On Medieval swords the cross guard may be called simply the " cross " , or just the " guard " .
Pommel : Latin for " little apple " , the counter - weight which secures the hilt to the blade and allows the hand either rest on it or grip it .
Forte ' : A Renaissance term for the upper portion on a sword blade which has more control and strength and which does most of the parrying .
Also called prime or fort .
Foible : A Renaissance term for the lower portion on a sword blade which is weaker ( or " feeble " ) but has more agility and speed and which does most of the attacking .
Fuller -
A shallow central - groove or channel on a blade which lightens it as well as improves strength and flex .
Sometimes mistakenly called a " blood - run " or " blood - groove " , it has nothing to do with blood flow , cutting power , or a blade sticking .
A sword might have one , none , or several fullers running a portion of its length , on either one or both sides .
Narrow deep fullers are also sometimes referred to as flukes .
The opposite of a fuller is a riser , which improves rigidity .
Grip -
The handle of a sword , usually made of leather , wire , bone , horn , or ivory ( also , a term for the method of holding the sword ) .
Lower end - the tip portion of a Medieval sword Pommel - Latin for " little apple " , the counter - weight which secures the hilt to the blade and allows the hand to either rest on it or grip it .
Sometimes it includes a small rivet ( capstan rivet ) called a pommel nut , pommel bolt , or tang nut .
On some Medieval swords the pommel may be partially or fully gripped and handled .
Ricasso -
The dull portion of a blade just above the hilt .
It is intended for wrapping the index finger around to give greater tip control ( called " fingering " ) .
Not all sword forms had ricasso .
They can be found on many Bastard - swords , most cut & thrust swords and later rapiers .
Those on Two - Handed swords are sometimes called a " false - grip " , and usually allow the entire second had to grip and hold on .
The origin of the term is obscure .
Shoulder -
The corner portion of a sword separating the blade from the tang .
Tang -
The un -edged hidden portion or ( " tongue " ) of a blade running through the handle and to which the pommel is attached .
The place where the tang connects to the blade is called the " shoulder " .
A sword 's tang is sometimes of a different temper than the blade itself .
The origin of the term is obscure .
Upper end -
The hilt portion of a Medieval sword Waisted - grip - A specially shaped handle on some bastard or hand - and - a - half swords , consisting of a slightly wider middle and tapering towards the pommel .
Annellet / Finger - Ring :
The small loops extending toward the blade from the quillions intended to protect a finger wrapped over the guard .
They developed in the middle - ages and can be found on many styles of Late - Medieval swords .
They are common on Renaissance cut & thrust swords and rapiers they and also small - swords .
For some time they have been incorrectly called the " pas d`ane " .
Compound - Hilt / Complex - Guard : A term used for the various forms of hilt found on Renaissance and some late - Medieval swords .
They consist typically of finger - rings , side - rings or ports , a knuckle - bar , and counter - guard or back - guard .
Swept - hilts , ring - hilts , cage - hilts , and some basket - hilts are forms of complex - guard .
When Arthur Rubinstein died last December at the age of ninety - five , there was remarkably little feeling of loss in the musical community .
As had been the case with his life , Rubinstein ’s death too seemed natural , another fulfillment of the kind which appeared ( at least to onlookers ) always to have been his lot .
Rubinstein enjoyed a long and splendid career .
Born in 1887 , he was before the public from the 1890 ’s to the 1970 ’s , a period beginning with the vigorous manhood of Claude Debussy and ending with the old age of John Cage .
Despite this almost unparalleled longevity as a performer , he was never , even during the years of his phenomenal success , perceived as the world ’s greatest pianist .
During the 1920 ’s , for example , this title was shared by Josef Hofmann and Sergei Rachmaninoff ; from the mid-1930 ’s to the present day , the undisputed champion has been Vladimir Horowitz .
And if the applicable title were to be not the world ’s greatest pianist but the world ’s greatest musician - pianist , the names of Artur Schnabel , Alfred Cortot , and Edwin Fischer would seem , for most music lovers , beyond compare .
Hofmann , Rachmaninoff , and Horowitz all belong to the class of virtuosi , those who astound by feats of dexterity , lightness , and elegantly applied force .
Schnabel , Cortot , and Fischer are regarded as thinkers , those whose musical ideas are always prior to , and more interesting than , mere mechanical execution .
Rubinstein , by contrast , did not astonish with his fingers , and he did not inspire with his mind .
He did both less and more : he gave pleasure , he made his listeners happy — in a word , he entertained .
Not only was this his claim to fame and riches , it is now his claim to our admiration .
The story of Rubinstein ’s life is to be found , no doubt often highly embroidered , in two marvelous volumes of memoirs , written in the 1970 ’s when his failing eyesight and strength made further piano playing difficult .
1
These more than one thousand pages tell of a Jewish prodigy from Poland who managed , at the age of three , to impress the great violinist Joachim , friend and adviser to Brahms .
From the age of ten , Rubinstein ( under Joachim ’s guidance ) studied in Berlin : piano with Heinrich Barth and theory with Max Bruch .
He worked a bit with Paderewski , and , perhaps more important , received a notable éducation sentimentale from numerous women who were only too charmed by his extreme youth and passionate eagerness to please .
Almost out of his teens , Rubinstein began to concertize extensively , though not yet profitably .
In 1906 he toured the United States , giving 75 concerts , not very successful , under the sponsorship of the Knabe Piano Company .
Residence in Paris brought him into contact with the jeunesse dorée , and some of its aristocratic elders as well .
Great names of society and music whizzed in and out of his life ; he dined out much more often and more regularly than he practiced the piano .
When he visited Poland , he hardly saw his family , choosing instead to pass the time in the great world of Warsaw .
And wherever he lived , he was on a kind of dole .
Such a state of affairs was hardly tenable .
In 1908 , this creature , who had so clearly been born to gladden hearts , attempted suicide in Berlin , the scene of his dreary student days .
The attempt itself — at least as he himself describes it — was farcical , but in his memoirs he adds bathos to farce as he tells what happened next :
Then , half - consciously , I staggered to the piano and cried myself out in music .
Music , my beloved music , the dear companion of all my emotions , who can stir us to fight , who can inflame in us love and passion , and who can soothe our pains and bring peace to our hearts — you are the one who , on that ignominious day , brought me back to life .
Beyond the self - indulgence , something important had happened .
From this day forward , Rubinstein was the man we have always known : “ . . .
I discovered the secret of happiness and I still cherish it : Love life for better for worse , without conditions . ”
Though worldly success was still a few years off , Rubinstein was now ready to receive it .
His musical reputation grew , as did his contacts with such famous artists as Leopold Godowsky , Pablo Casals , and Eugène Ysaye .
In London , just before and during World War I , he laid the foundation for his later English triumphs .
Indeed , it was in London in 1915 that Rubinstein received a concert offer which was to mark the beginning of fame and fortune : an invitation to play the Brahms D minor Concerto in San Sebastián .
_____________
Rubinstein came to Spain and conquered .
In his memoirs he is characteristically frank in describing what happened in San Sebastián :
The concert was not well attended ; the theater was only half - filled .
But my personal success , after this monumental and sober work , was absolutely sensational .
No Saint - Saëns , no Liszt , no Chopin , had ever excited a public to that extent .
During the 1916 - 17 season he gave more than a hundred concerts in Spain .
With this kind of success , it was hardly surprising that he soon received an invitation to Argentina .
There , and in the rest of South America , he scored a success even greater than in Spain .
For Rubinstein , the 1920 ’s marked an extraordinary period in which he combined the life of an artist with that of a boulevardier .
He immersed himself in the currents of modern art ; he was a friend of the French Les Six and of Jean Cocteau , the major influence upon that group .
He associated with , and played the music of , Karol Szymanowski , Poland ’s greatest 20th - century composer .
He performed widely a piano transcription of Stravinsky ’s Petrushka which the composer himself had written for him .
He became close to Manuel de Falla in Spain and to Heitor Villa - Lobos in Brazil , and he played their works all over the world .
De Falla ’s “ Ritual Fire Dance ” from El amor brujo and , to a lesser extent , Villa - Lobos ’s short Polichinelle became Rubinstein ’s ubiquitous musical signature .
The 1920 ’s also saw the beginnings of Rubinstein ’s prolific career as a maker of phonograph records .
2
In a remarkable display of constancy in this age of shifting commercial arrangements , the pianist spent more than a half - century with just two recording companies : first His Master ’s Voice in England , then passing on to its affiliate RCA when he became an American resident in the 1940’s .
It was his work in the recording studio , combined with the advent of Vladimir Horowitz as a virtuoso technician , that convinced Rubinstein that in performance he needed to do more than just give the spirit of a composition , letting the exact notes fall ( as he always had ) where they might .
In his personal life , too , Rubinstein was now ready to settle down .
In 1932 , this confirmed bachelor married a woman half his age .
Aniela Mlynarska was the daughter of Emil Mlynarski , the foremost Polish conductor of the day .
She provided Rubinstein with a family — they eventually had four children — and the kind of social stability he craved .
The ensuing fifty years were a whirlwind of concerts and tours , of elegant homes on both coasts of the United States and in Paris , of endless supplies of wine , song , and lobster , if not ( as before ) women .
Rubinstein continued to play almost into his nineties .
Indeed , it seemed that his appetite for playing , and his strength to indulge the appetite , grew as he himself grew older .
In the mid-1950 ’s , for instance , in a series of five concerts repeated in Paris , London , and New York , he played again seventeen of the concertos he had done over the years : works by Beethoven , Brahms , Chopin , Schumann , Mozart , Liszt , Saint - Saëns , Rachmaninoff , Franck , Grieg , and de Falla .
In just a single concert he would do both Brahms concertos or three Beethoven concertos .
In 1961 , he gave a series of ten solo recitals in New York , playing different pieces on each program .
His last concert was a benefit at Wigmore Hall in London in April 1976 .
Once again , his memoirs sum up both the moment and his retrospective feelings about it :
As for myself , it was a symbolic gesture ; it was in this hall that I had given my first recital in London [ in 1912 ] and playing there for the last time in my life made me think of my whole career in the form of a sonata .
The first movement represented the struggles of my youth , the following andante [ stood ] for the beginning of a more serious aspect of my talent , a scherzo represented well the unexpected great success , and the finale turned out to be a wonderful moving end .
_____________
Now that Rubinstein is dead , it is at last possible to assess his achievement as an artist .
No one will dispute that his audiences enjoyed his concerts .
But there is a deeper question to be answered : just how well did Rubinstein play ?
Perhaps the best place to begin is with some of the numerous and widely available stereo LP recordings Rubinstein made for RCA during the 1950’s , 1960 ’s , and 1970’s .
There are something like one hundred of them , and they cover , with few exceptions , the repertory he played during his lifetime .
Here are most of the great romantic concertos and many of the classical works for piano and orchestra ; here too are almost all the solo works of Chopin , several of the most popular Beethoven sonatas , some of the most important solo works of Schumann , and a smattering of the earlier 20th - century music Rubinstein played not out of duty but out of liking .
And there are numerous examples here of chamber music for piano and strings , a genre which Rubinstein cultivated even at the times of his busiest concert activity .
Listening to these records en masse does make clear just what — in addition to Rubinstein ’s infectiously ebullient stage personality — gave his audiences so much pleasure .
In his records , one always hears clearly articulated melodies , proudly carried high above their pianistic background .
Yet these records also bear out Rubinstein ’s reputation among musicians : rarely do the performances seem unique documents either of pure piano - playing or of compelling cerebration .
The records are at their weakest , it seems to me , in performances of pre-Romantic music .
Rubinstein ’s approach to Mozart , as demonstrated in his concerto recordings , is heavy , often wayward in articulation , and immensely dutiful .
It is of some significance , too , that the orchestral background ( most likely at Rubinstein ’s choice ) is romantically sweet and overly full of feeling , rather than classically energetic and astringent as is required if the solo part is to be heard in proper context .
As for Rubinstein ’s recordings of the Beethoven concertos , of which the 1960 ’s set with Erich Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony and the 1970 ’s set with Daniel Barenboim and the London Philharmonic are both currently available , they offer clear examples of how far a pianist can go by knowing how the music ought to sound , even if the physical ability necessary to implement this conception is rapidly waning .
Not surprisingly , the earlier set , made when the pianist was “ only ” in his mid-seventies , seems somewhat fresher and less tenuous ; the latter , made more than a decade later , suggests the “ shipwreck ” that Charles de Gaulle called old age .
These are painful documents , not least because of the listener ’s constant awareness of an intensely captivating personality here defeated by infirmity .
On records as in concert , Rubinstein shied away from the late Beethoven sonatas ( though in his much younger days he did play the Sonata in B flat major , opus 106 , the “ Hammerklavier ” ) .
But he did often play such earlier works as the Pathétique ( C minor , opus 13 ) and the “ Appassionata ” ( F minor , opus 57 ) .
His early 1960 ’s recordings of these works , though technically adequate , seem cautious by comparison both with his reputation as a firebrand and with his 1950 ’s recordings of the same works .
For those used to the performances of Beethoven specialists , Rubinstein ’s approach will inevitably seem decorative , as if he were bemused by the local beauties of the music rather than concerned to communicate the strong bones of Beethoven ’s structures .
_____________
Rubinstein was renowned during his American heyday as a Brahms interpreter , and those fortunate enough to have heard him play the B flat Concerto in concert as late as 1960 will recall the magisterial approach he brought to this work , A 1959 recording with Josef Krips and the RCA Symphony Orchestra and a 1960 concert recording with Witold Rowicki and the Warsaw Philharmonic demonstrate not only how completely Rubinstein identified with this style , at once knotty and luxuriantly romantic , but also how well its technical problems were under his control even as he grew older .
By contrast , his last recording of the piece , with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra about 1970 , though pianistically vastly superior to his final Beethoven concerto efforts , can be no more than a souvenir for those who remember the artist in earlier and better days .
One of the most attractive features of Rubinstein ’s Brahms playing was his characteristically rich , deep tone , simultaneously tender and strong .
In his concerts , this tone was always in the forefront ; though it did not always survive in reproduction on modern records , it can be heard in the numerous short solo pieces of Brahms recorded by Rubinstein in the early days of stereo .
The same tone remains in evidence in the pianist ’s discs of Schumann , which include the famous A minor Concerto ( with Carlo Maria Giulini and the Chicago Symphony ) and such solo pieces as the Carneval , the Fantasiestücke opus 12 , and the Symphonic Etudes .
Here , on 1960 ’s stereo issues , there is much to admire in sensitivity and the sheer ability to make melodies and harmonies easily discernible by the listener ; yet these performances too seem to suffer from a certain digital lethargy , as if the pianist were having trouble getting his fingers and hands up from the keys quickly enough to provide the necessary space between the notes .
_____________
Throughout his American career , Rubinstein was most famous as a Chopinist .
His Chopin repertory was enormous , and he drew on it often in his recitals .
He recorded Chopin in quantity three times : first on 78 - RPM for HMV in England during the 1930 ’s , then for RCA on mono LP in the 1950’s , and then finally on stereo ( again for RCA ) in the late 1950 ’s and early 1960’s .
Many of these last records , including the Barcarolle , the Ballades , both Concertos , the Mazurkas , the Nocturnes , the Polonaises , both major Sonatas , and the Waltzes , are still easily available ; together they give a coherent picture of Rubinstein ’s Chopin playing at the end of his career .
That picture is essentially ruminative , gentle , often introverted , and also often backward in rhythmic impetus .
The Chopin presented by the later Rubinstein is a poet rather than a virtuoso , a self - reflecting musician rather than the heroic lion of the keyboard .
This essentially miniaturist approach , in Rubinstein ’s hands , is capable of producing many felicities ; on occasion , as in the Impromptus and the Berceuse , or in the quieter Mazurkas and Nocturnes , it is decidedly effective .
But when the music is itself on a larger canvas , as in the Barcarolle and the Polonaises , we are reminded all too often that what we are hearing is an old man ’s Chopin , a musical suit cut to fit the cloth of necessary caution .
Even where Rubinstein evidently decides to gamble , to push his fingers beyond their comfortable competence , as in the later recordings of the two Chopin concertos , the result is forced and artificially brilliant ; the whole somehow suggests those reproductions of paintings in which special care has been taken to make the colors seem bright and compelling .
There is a great difference between this kind of straining after survival and the true art of concerto playing which properly consists in the soloist ’s constantly shaping the entire performance , including that of often unresponsive orchestras and conductors .
To do this requires a kind of forcefulness Rubinstein clearly no longer possessed .
Enough has been said here to paint the essential outlines of the Rubinstein we can now hear in stereo .
His recordings of later music , including the Rachmaninoff C minor Concerto , the Paganini Rhapsody , and the Tchaikowsky B flat major Concerto , are still in the catalogues .
The late recording of the Rachmaninoff C minor with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia is notey and tame , altogether inferior to the earlier stereo version ( still available ) with Fritz Reiner and the Chicago .
The Paganini Rhapsody ( again with Reiner and the Chicago ) is a not very satisfactory account of a score Rubinstein learned relatively late in his life and with which he always had technical trouble .
The Tchaikowsky , with Erich Leinsdorf and the Boston , is a routine account of a work which Rubinstein ’s arch-rival Vladimir Horowitz made peculiarly his own ( in recordings with Toscanini ) .
If the 1960 performance of the Brahms B flat Concerto is a magisterial document , then one side of a disc containing excerpts from the ten - concert series in New York in 1961 is a document both of the intimate Rubinstein and of Rubinstein the performer of 20th - century music .
On this record , no longer available , the pianist plays twelve Visions Fugitives ( from opus 22 ) of Prokofiev and the Próle do Bébé Suite ( 1918 ) by Villa - Lobos .
His playing treats every note with seriousness , commitment , and , above all , with a plentiful fancy ; the result is delectable , and sad too , in its way : still more evidence , if more were needed , of the fundamentally wrong road taken by piano music sometime after the 1920’s .
_____________
It goes without saying that in the last two decades of his life Arthur Rubinstein played magnificently for a man of his age ; it also goes without saying that his audiences , to the very end , were conscious of receiving full value .
If such factors were all that were relevant in the making of musical judgments , then Rubinstein ’s career could now be seen as having reached its greatest triumph at its close .
But more is involved than an audience memory of Arthur Rubinstein , even though that memory is one of pleasure .
Although there once was a time when all that was left of an artist ’s reputation after his death lay secreted in the fading and inaccurate memories of concert - goers , now everything is different .
Proof of that difference has been the very fact that I have been able to examine Rubinstein ’s playing not just memory by memory , but by listening to note after note .
It is the phenomenon of sound recording which has made this difference ; and it is the enormously prestigious Rubinstein recorded archive which requires us to take his playing seriously .
For these recordings are now widely taken as imperishable documents of an authentic tradition ; as such , they will continue to shape the expectations and perceptions of audiences .
Because this is the way such music is supposed to sound , this is the way audiences will want it to sound .
As far as young performers ( and their teachers ) are concerned , it can be put crassly : here is what succeeded .
With this model as a guide , others too may find fame and fortune at the keyboard .
Lest this seem cynical , consider the extent to which today ’s pianists , regardless of age , sound old ; indeed , the present generation of musicians has turned the adage “ wise beyond one ’s years ” into anything but a compliment .
Among pianists , outbursts of brilliance are too often seen as proof of immaturity and unmusicality ; every fast tempo and forceful dynamic scheme is taken as a sign of insensitivity .
What is the antidote to these artistic shortcomings ?
Listen to the great , students are told .
Given the synthetic character of creative musical life today , it would be quixotic to ask that audiences and musicians cease listening to recordings .
And as for music criticism , whatever else it might or might not be able to do , it can hardly be expected to inspire originality .
Critics have little choice but to make distinctions , to point out better and worse .
Fortunately , such an act of discrimination is possible in the case of Arthur Rubinstein , for in addition to the records I have been discussing , there is another kind of playing to be heard from this pianist .
I refer to Rubinstein ’s earlier recordings .
By earlier I do not , for the most part , mean his mono LP discs , or even the many 78 ’s he made in this country during the 1940’s .
Despite the presence among those recordings of several excellent performances — in particular chamber music with Heifetz and Feuermann ( later Piatigorsky ) and both the Symphonie Concertante and the first four Mazurkas of Szymanowski — Rubinstein ’s playing on them often sounds hard and brittle , as if he were attempting to give a perfect performance for the microphone .
Such , indeed , may well have been the case .
Much has been made , correctly , of the chilling effect that the meteoric rise of Vladimir Horowitz had on Rubinstein ’s perception of his own technical abilities ; too little has been said in this connection of the pianist ’s own thoughts on the impact of the phenomenon of recording .
In the second volume of his memoirs , describing his life in Paris just before the outbreak of World War II , Rubinstein writes :
My readers will certainly be astonished that now I seem to barely mention my music making and my concerts , but to describe long tours , concert by concert with detailed programs , is utterly impossible .
All I can say now is that my playing improved considerably , mainly due to the fact that the American public was more demanding than any other , and also to my recordings , which had to be note - perfect and inspired .
The result was that I learned to love practicing and to discover new meanings in the works I performed .
But did Rubinstein ’s playing improve ?
The answer — coming , as it can only come , from recordings of this period — must be no .
For a reasonably large body exists of Rubinstein recordings made at a still earlier moment , on European if not on American labels ; and this body of recordings from before the late 1930 ’s provides eloquent testimony that Arthur Rubinstein was once a supremely great pianist , with a supremely interesting and exciting personal approach to music .
_____________
Perhaps the earliest of Rubinstein ’s HMV records was a disc he made in 1928 of the Schubert Impromptu in A flat major ( D. 899 , 4 ) and the Chopin Waltz , again in A flat major , opus 34 , no .
1.3 The Schubert is searchingly musical and pianistically magnificent ; comparison with the later and now standard recordings of Fischer and Schnabel suggests that only Schnabel was in Rubinstein ’s league as a Schubert player .
The Chopin is by turns tender , gay , and brilliant ; the technical mastery Rubinstein possessed at this time is made startlingly clear in his ability to play difficult decorative figures at extreme speed and with exemplary clarity .
The next record in the HMV numbering series is the Chopin Barcarolle .
4
Not only is this performance distinguished by a piano tone beautiful even for Rubinstein ( in his memoirs , we are told that it was done on a Blüthner rather than the more likely Steinway or Bech - stein ) ; it also brings together , on a large scale , the same combination of insight and virtuosity the pianist shows in the Schubert and Chopin “ miniatures . ”
Here , in the grandest romatic music , is freedom elevated to the rank of order .
And on a purely mechanical level , informed ears will hear on this disc remarkable trills , octaves , and runs .
The next year Rubinstein made a record of his — and his audience ’s — beloved Spanish music .
5 Navarra and Sevilla of Albeniz are authentic crowd pleasers , and they are also tests both of a pianist ’s rhythmic sense and of his ability to play dense chordal masses at great speed without heaviness .
Rubinstein succeeds magnificently , and one ’s pleasure in the gorgeous color and ease he brings to this music is hardly diminished by the liberties he takes in the Navarra with the exact text Albeniz prescribed .
On the next record of Rubinstein issued by HMV at this time , 6 we find an unlikely combination : the Brahms Capriccio in B minor , opus 76 , no.
2 , and the Debussy Prelude from Book I , La Cathédrale engloutie .
Each performance is completely in the character of the music it presents , and one scarcely knows which to admire more , the yoking of a serious approach with a light piano tone in the Brahms or the bell - like clarity of the sonorities in the Debussy .
_____________
Because Rubinstein had made no prior recordings with orchestra , perhaps the greatest interest attaches to his discs of the Brahms B flat Concerto made in 1929 ( or 1930 : the memoirs are unclear on the matter ) .
7
He seems to have been uncomfortable during the recording sessions , because he was physically separated from the conductor , Albert Coates , with whom in any case he had had no chance to rehearse .
Rubinstein wanted the takes destroyed , and one can understand his reasons : he plays wrong notes galore , and the orchestra ( the London Symphony ) is hardly first - class .
But the performance is still extraordinary ; Rubinstein plays without caution , as if in full confidence of his ability to get the keys down properly without taking individual aim at each one .
There is no point in looking to this recording for the ultimate in realized perfection ; there is every reason to cite it as an example of that pianistic attitude of risk and force which must underlie concerto playing .
Much has been written about Rubinstein ’s 1931 recording of the Chopin F minor Concerto with John Barbirolli and the London Symphony Orchestra ; 8 it is enough here to remark that , for those fortunate to own the original 78 ’s or to have access to the LP reissue , it still sets the standard for richness of tone and intimate force of conception .
The recording , probably made the next year , of the Brahms Sonata in D minor for violin and piano , in which Rubinstein appears with his Polish compatriot Paul Kochanski,9 is an extraordinary example of chamber - music playing .
Kochanski , sadly an under - recorded violinist , plays beautifully ; Rubinstein is able to make soft piano phrases clear without drowning his partner out .
Rubinstein ’s recording of the Triana of Albeniz ( again , as with the Navarra , in his own version ) 10 maintains the caliber of his achievement in Spanish music ; three Villa - Lobos pieces on the other side of this disc document not just wonderfully attractive music , but also the incredible hand coordination Rubinstein deployed at this time .
It is difficult to praise too highly his 1932 recording of all the Chopin Scherzos11 and the 1934 - 35 discs of the complete Polonaises .
12
In their combination of power and beauty they are unrivalled .
Exceptional among these performances are those of the B minor Scherzo and the two famous Polonaises , the so - called “ Military ” in A major and the “ Heroic ” in Aflat major .
Whether one fastens upon the passage work , the repeated chords , the rapid left - hand octaves , or just the sustained cantilena , here is a summit of Chopin playing and of piano playing altogether .
One recording from this period remains to be mentioned .
As I suggested earlier , we have grown to associate the Tchaikowsky Concerto in B flat minor with the name of Horowitz ; his supercharged performances with Toscanini seem about as far as human capacities can go in the direction of icy brilliance , breakneck excitement , and the extremes of strength and speed .
Rubinstein , however , made a recording of this work almost a decade before Horowitz ; 13 done with Barbirolli and the London Symphony , it was a great seller before ( though not after ) the first Horowitz album appeared in 1941 .
Rubinstein ’s performance of the Tchaikowsky on this early recording is lighter than Horowitz ’s .
Only a little , if at all , slower , it is not so relentlessly driven , and it is a good deal more “ romantic . ”
Indeed , instead of the Horowitz excitement , Rubinstein supplies sentiment .
Today , after a generation of pianistic attempts to imitate Horowitz ’s daggerlike fingers , it would seem that Rubinstein ’s more luxuriant approach wears rather better .
_____________
These early records , taken together , go a long way toward explaining Rubinstein ’s success in the concert hall .
He provided technique , daring , emotion , tenderness , power , all in about equal measure .
Fortunately , evidence of just what he did supply in concert ( rather than in the studio ) can be found on recordings made live without subsequent editing .
In this regard , two performances from the 1940 ’s stand out .
They are both of concertos : one , from 1944 , of the Beethoven C minor with Toscanini and the NBC Symphony , 14 and the other , from 1947 , of the Chopin E minor with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic .15
Here , collaborating with great conductors and orchestras , Rubinstein does indeed prove himself the supreme entertainer among pianists — not because he was a show - off in the manner of a Pavarotti , but because he brought the culture of a great musician to the pleasurable re-creation of the greatest art .
Though he gladly accepted the love and homage of the audience , he gave in return an authentic experience of the highest culture of the 19th century .
That he did this for so many , and for so many years , is proof enough that in calling him an entertainer one is not denigrating him , but rather raising him far above the pack of applause - mongers whom music - lovers know today as “ stars . ”

2 Material has recently come to light , through a letter by James Methuen - Camp - bell in the April 1983 Gramophone , suggesting that Rubinstein made at least one disc for a Polish company around 1910 .

The two sides have had troops and equipment in the area since July Two Cambodian soldiers have been killed in an exchange of gunfire with Thai troops along a disputed section of their border .
The clash , near the ancient Preah Vihear temple , has prompted Thailand to urge its nationals to leave Cambodia .
Tension has been high since July , when hundreds of soldiers on both sides faced off metres apart .
Both sides have said they want to find a peaceful solution and will hold talks to discuss the conflict .
Thailand and Cambodia both claim they own the area around the temple , which recently became a Unesco World Heritage site .
Officials from both countries have claimed the other side fired first .
' Good neighbour '
The exchanges of small arms fire and rocket - propelled grenades were reported to have continued for about an hour .
Political tensions drive row In pictures : Preah Vihear Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Namhong said two soldiers had been killed and two wounded while Thai officials said five Thai troops had been wounded .
Mr Hor Namhong said another 10 Thai soldiers had been captured but would be well treated and returned home if Bangkok requested .
However , Bangkok said that none of its soldiers were missing .
A Cambodian army official told the Associated Press news agency that commanders from both sides were trying to negotiate a ceasefire .
Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat said the fighting was " small scale " and that he was committed to reaching a settlement over the issue with Cambodia , which he described as " a good neighbour " .
After fighting broke out , Thailand alerted air force jets and readied transport planes to evacuate Thai nationals from Cambodia .
' Death zone '
The military stand - off began in July when Cambodian troops detained three Thai protesters who had entered the site illegally .
TEMPLE DISPUTE TIMELINE
1962 : International court awards temple to Cambodia , but surrounding land remains undesignated 1970s - 1990s : Khmer Rouge guerrillas occupy site 2001 - 2002 :
Thai troops block access over water row July 2008 : Unesco lists temple as a World Heritage Site July 2008 : Thai FM quits after court rules he violated constitution for backing Cambodia 's Unesco bid July 2008 : Both sides move troops to temple area August 2008 : Troops withdrawn after high - level talks October 2008 : Fighting erupts around temple area
More than 1,000 soldiers from both countries moved into the area , digging trenches into the rough terrain around the temple .
In August , military personnel agreed to withdraw most of the troops from the area but in early October , Cambodia claimed that Thai troops had returned .
Thailand has denied that its troops entered Cambodian territory .
But on Tuesday , Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen threatened to turn the area into a " death zone " if the Thai troops did not withdraw .
The two countries have held several rounds of talks but have so far failed to reach a settlement .
Mr Hor Namhong said that talks to be held on Thursday were a good sign that the countries could begin to resolve this week 's conflict , which was said was " an incident between soldiers and not an invasion by Thailand " .
Ancient dispute
The stand - off between the two countries centres on 1.8 square miles ( 4.6 sq km ) of scrub near the 900 - year - old Preah Vihear temple , which sits on a jungle - clad escarpment dividing the countries .
Preah Vihear is listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site
The temple is only accessible from Thailand and the area around it is heavily mined - a legacy of Cambodia 's long war against the Khmer Rouge guerrillas .
An international court awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962 , but land surrounding it remains the subject of rival territorial claims .
The decision by the UN in June to list Preah Vihear as a World Heritage Site reignited lingering nationalist tensions .
Disputes between the two countries date back centuries when the Thai and Khmer monarchs fought each other for territory and power .
In 2003 , the Thai embassy in Phnom Penh was torched by rioters angry over the alleged comments of a Thai actress who said that the Angkor Wat temple complex should be returned to Thailand .

Here ’s a transcript of Katie Couric ’s interview with Sarah Palin , from September 24 and September 25 , 2008
Katie Couric : Governor Palin , could you explain specifically how Alaska ’s proximity to Russia gives you experience in international affairs ?
Governor Sarah Palin :
When you even consider national security issues with Russia as Putin rears his head and comes into the airspace of the United States of America , Where do they go ?
It ’s Alaska , it ’s right over the border , it is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this powerful nation , Russia , because they are right there , they are next to our state which is Alaska , the state closest to Russia , a country that is very big and large with large and big apparatus of the military , so as governor of Alaska I have the experience of keeping an eye out there for Putin ’s head rear , which I do , and I ’m ready to call out the national guard , which I have the power to do as governor , if Putin flies over to attack us , so why would someone make fun of , I mean , well , ya , it ’s like so like , ya , the media - you know how they are , and I know who the good guys are and the bad guys are , so what I like to do Katie is I like to root for the good guys and support them and try not to root for the bad guys that could fly over into Alaska and if they do I have the experience to stop them which I can get ya more information on for ya soon Katie and I did put that jet on Ebay Katie and I told congress thanks but no thanks with that bridge to nowhere I supported , because really , when you even consider national security issues with Russia as Putin rears his head and comes into the airspace of the United States of America , Where do they go ?
It ’s Alaska , it ’s right over the border , it is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this powerful nation , Russia , because they are right there , they are next to our state which is Alaska , the state closest to Russia , a country that is very big and large with large and big apparatus of the military , so as governor of Alaska I have the experience of keeping an eye out there for Putin ’s head rear , which I do , and I ’m ready to call out the national guard , which I have the power to do as governor , if Putin flies over to attack us , so why would someone make fun of , I mean , well , ya , it ’s like so like , ya , the media - you know how they are , and I know who the good guys are and the bad guys are , so what I like to do Katie is I like to root for the good guys and support them and try not to root for the bad guys that could fly over into Alaska and if they do I have the experience to stop them which I can get ya more information on for ya soon Katie , ok ?
And I put that jet on ebay and told congress thanks but no thanks about that bridge to nowhere .
Katie ?
Are you awake ?
Katie Couric : Hmm ?
So that must be what Charlie Gibson meant about a “ blizzard of words ” …
I do n’t even remember what question you were answering .
Well , um , thank you for joining us today .
Sarah Palin : Yah , sure Katie , you betcha now okay bye bye .

Car owners know the tough call :
When do you stop putting money into a rickety auto ?
Congress faces a similar decision this month .
Should it put money into a failing US car industry ?
The answer would be simple if Midwest swing states were n't up for grabs in the presidential election .
Both John McCain and Barack Obama have backed a plan in the works on Capitol Hill to provide more than $ 25 billion in loans to the Big Three automakers .
That political stance may go down well in the high electoral - vote states with US car plants ( Michigan , Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois ) .
But voters elsewhere should ask :
Will these ailing companies and their unions really accept radical reform , ensuring that these loans are paid back ?
To persuade US lawmakers to pass an emergency loan for them within weeks , executives from General Motors , Ford , and Chrysler were out in force at the party conventions in St. Paul , Minn. , and Denver to plead that the industry is " deserving " of government credit .
Deserving ?
Years of mismanagement , high executive salaries , and overly generous worker benefits have indeed hurt the Big Three .
Last month , their new car sales were down by double digits compared with a year ago .
The decline has left them with low credit ratings , making it difficult to borrow .
But guess what .
Despite a slowing US economy , Toyota and Honda saw only single - digit losses in their August sales .
Nissan 's sales were up .
Those companies know how to run successful auto manufacturing plants in the US and are n't asking for help .
They can sell good cars at reasonable prices with labor compensation packages at $ 40 to $ 50 an hour per American worker .
GM is still stuck with " legacy costs , " or past agreements that leave it paying $ 70 an hour , and has to heavily discount prices on auto sales .
Many lawmakers will justify these loans by saying the United States needs the Big Three to " go green " by developing more fuel - efficient vehicles and better batteries for hybrid or electric cars .
But many foreign carmakers are already there , or going there , with nimble , innovative , and smarter responses to a shifting market and to congressional fuel - economy mandates .
They did n't make the big mistake of focusing on trucks and SUVs as Detroit did and then asking for a loan that may end up simply becoming a bailout .
Detroit is no more deserving than many other US industries – textiles , furniture , toys – that have failed to compete well against foreign companies .
But if Congress does decide to risk money on the US automakers – and overcome President Bush 's opposition – it ought to at least demand big changes from the Big Three and their unions .
US airlines have been able to retool themselves through bankruptcies , mergers , union concessions , layoffs , and other difficult steps .
After the national disaster of 9/11 that closed down the air system for a week and disrupted air service for weeks , they received emergency cash and $ 1.17 billion in government loans – but that came with strict oversight and tough restrictions .
Congress should n't rescue an auto industry and its unions that are n't doing enough to rescue themselves .
The federal government is already trying to save one public - private partnership , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
It does n't need to become a credit master to another faltering industry .

What is happening in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ?
At least 200,000 people have fled their homes in eastern Congo in the last three months .
Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary general , has warned of a humanitarian crisis of " catastrophic dimensions " .
There is fear of a return to full - scale war in a country still recovering from years of conflict .
Why has fighting flared up ?
Laurent Nkunda , a renegade general and ethnic Tutsi , has accused the Congolese government of failing to protect Tutsi people from Hutu militias who escaped to Congo after taking part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which 500,000 Tutsis were killed .
Nkunda , who broke away from the national army last September after it absorbed his forces , has been fighting the government .
Violence has reached new levels in the last few months .
This week , hopes of some sort of political deal received a boost when the rebels reversed course and agreed to meet the governor of North Kivu , Julien Paluku , after earlier rejecting talks on grounds he did not represent the central government in Kinshasa .
Nkunda recently threatened to take the war all the way to Kinshasa , Congo 's capital , on the other side of the country .
How serious is Nkunda 's threat ?
His forces are much better trained and equipped than the government troops , who are notorious for turning their guns on civilians and fleeing when faced with a real threat .
The Congolese army is a motley collection of defeated army troops , rebels and militia groups left over from back - to - back wars from 1997 to 2003 that left an estimated 5 million people dead .
It is disjointed , undisciplined , demoralised and poorly paid , with the lowest - ranking soldiers getting little more than $ 20 ( £ 12 ) a month .
Nkunda , who has been implicated in numerous war crimes , is believed to command about 5,500 highly trained and disciplined fighters .
The rebellion that overthrew the longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko began in the east .
Does Nkunda have outside support ?
UN security officials and some diplomats in the region believe Rwanda is giving him ammunition and other material support .
Rwanda denies this , but the general does serve Rwandan interests , as he heads the only force in eastern Congo willing to take on the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda ( FDLR ) , a group led by Hutus blamed for the Rwandan genocide .
The Congolese government , led by Joseph Kabila , accuses Rwanda of using Nkunda as a proxy to exercise control in eastern Congo , where it has financial interests in illegal mining .
What does Rwanda say ?
Rwanda 's president , Paul Kagame , argues Congo must confront the Hutu rebels who control large tracts of the east of the country .
Rwanda claims they are intent on overthrowing the Tutsi-led government in Kigali .
Joint military action by Congolese forces and the FDLR against Nkunda has fuelled Rwandan suspicions that Kinshasa is not serious about confronting these armed Hutu groups .
What is the UN doing ?
The UN has 17,000 peacekeepers in Congo , its largest mission in the world , but Monuc , as it is called , is overstretched .
The inability of the UN to stop the fighting in a diamond - rich region where people are desperately poor has fuelled resentment .
Civilians have been repeatedly displaced by rebel and army attacks since the official end of the war in 2003 .
Thousands of demonstrators attacked the UN headquarters in Goma , smashing cars and office windows , at the height of the fighting in October .
UN troops have been sucked into the latest violence , using helicopter gunships against the rebels .
How are peacekeepers coping ?
The UN force is in disarray .
Its commander , Lieutenant General Vicente Diaz de Villegas of Spain , resigned in October after seven weeks in the job , citing personal reasons .
Unnamed UN officials say the general had criticised the lack of a coherent strategy , mandate and resources .
The UN is sending an extra 3,000 troops following the latest upsurge of fighting , but expectations that the European Union might send an interim force to bolster 5,000 UN peacekeepers in North Kivu have faded as several European officials said immediate prospects of doing so were unlikely .
Monuc is worried about another area in eastern Congo - the district of Ituri , where Congolese militias have been stepping up their activities for the past two months .
What is the solution ?
The International Crisis Group thinktank says that in the long term Congo must develop a plan with Rwanda and the UN to isolate and capture the FDLR's Hutu leaders responsible for the Rwandan genocide .
It says those who were not involved in the killings and are willing to demobilise should be offered resettlement in the Congo or integration with the Rwandan army .
The case of Han van Meegeren , the boldest modern forger of Old Masters ( as far as we know ) , is a grand yarn of twisty deceit , involving prestigious dupes and scads of money , with a sensational trial at the finish .
It even has a serious side .
Van Meegeren , since his death , in 1947 , has become a compulsive reference for philosophical discussions of fact and fraud in art — a subject bound to disquiet art lovers .
( Be honest .
What you are given to believe about an art work is going to color your experience of it . )
He became the most original of fakers when , starting in 1936 , he put aside mere canny simulations , mostly of the work of Johannes Vermeer , to create wildly implausible pictures which were presented as discoveries of a missing phase in the artist ’s conveniently spotty , little - documented opus .
( Only thirty - five undisputed Vermeers exist today .
As an added boon to forgers , a few are n’t very good . )
Van Meegeren ’s tour de force was a feat more of intellect than of skill .
He knew whom he had to fool first : an eighty - three - year - old monster of vanity named Abraham Bredius , who had an earned , though moldering , track record as an authenticator of newfound Vermeers .
In 1937 , in the august British art - history journal The Burlington Magazine , Bredius declared “ The Supper at Emmaus , ” the first of van Meegeren ’s late counterfeits , to be “ the masterpiece of Johannes Vermeer of Delft . ”
Other Dutch experts concurred , under pressure to keep a national treasure from being sold overseas .
( The remarkably dreary canvas still hangs , presented now as a historical curio , at the Boijmans Museum , in Rotterdam , which bought it in 1937 . )
It took van Meegeren himself to reveal the truth , in 1945 , when not to do so might have put his neck in a hangman ’s noose .

Two new books re-spin the van Meegeren saga , one breezily , with entertaining digressions on secondary figures and the arcana of forgery , and the other in profoundly researched , focussed , absorbing depth .
“ The Forger ’s Spell : A True Story of Vermeer , Nazis , and the Greatest Art Hoax of the Twentieth Century ” ( Harper ; $ 26.95 ) , by the science journalist Edward Dolnick , aggrandizes the story ’s abundant hooks , such as the happenstance that van Meegeren ’s victims included the art maven Hermann Göring , who , in 1943 , swapped a hundred and thirty - seven paintings from his largely ill - gotten collection for a van Meegeren Vermeer .
“ The Man Who Made Vermeers : Unvarnishing the Legend of Master Forger Han van Meegeren ” ( Harcourt ; $ 26 ) , by the writer and artist Jonathan Lopez , brings hard light to van Meegeren ’s machinations and ( very bad ) character .
Lopez debunks the myths , savored by Dolnick , which cast the forger as a romantic avenger , and which sweeten the tale in other ways .
It seems that Göring , while awaiting trial in Nuremberg , may not have learned that his cherished Vermeer was a phony , as nice as it is to think that he did .
This small point is notable because , in time , the fact that van Meegeren had scammed Göring helped him not only to evade charges of collaboration but to become a folk hero .
Lopez demonstrates how evidence of the painter ’s coziness with the Occupation regime got buried by the single question of whether he had sold Göring a patrimonial cynosure ( potentially a capital offense ) or a worthless fake .
Early in 1947 , a newspaper poll found van Meegeren to be the second most popular man in the Netherlands , after the newly elected Prime Minister .
Van Meegeren was born in 1889 , in the provincial city of Deventer , the third of five children in a middle - class Catholic family .
In 1907 , his father , a schoolmaster , sent him to Vermeer ’s city , Delft , to study architecture .
The feckless lad preferred to paint and draw .
In 1911 , he got his girlfriend , a Protestant named Anna de Voogt , pregnant .
They married and soon had a second child .
He worked as an assistant drawing instructor ( the only steady job he ever held ) until 1917 , when he moved his household to “ the city of beautiful nonsense , ” as a contemporaneous guidebook characterized The Hague — the home of the royal family and an illustrious strutting ground for the idle rich .
There he launched himself as an artist .
With “ his small , birdlike frame constantly aflutter and his irreverent sense of humor , ” in Lopez ’s description , van Meegeren beguiled the town .
( A photograph of him from 1918 , in Lopez ’s book , made me laugh out loud ; he comes across as the archetypal simpering fop , fit to start a scene by P. G. Wodehouse . )
Lopez — who , unlike Dolnick , speaks Dutch and is steeped in the history of the period — records that van Meegeren became the favorite artist of the Liberal State Party of the Netherlands , a fading force of the patrician élite .
His work was sprightly , in a nostalgically conservative vein .
His pretty , filmy drawing of a doe , identified as a pet of the young Princess Julianna , became a popular icon throughout the Netherlands .
Reproductions testify that he had a subtle sense of color and a firm gift for telling portraiture .
Come to think of it , what are artistic forgeries but portraits of imaginary art works ?
Van Meegeren ’s first legitimate exhibition in The Hague , in 1917 , of work in several genres , reaped positive reviews .
His second , five years later , of Christian religious paintings , sold well but repelled critics with its treacly piety — van Meegeren , it turned out , was a student of Scripture .
( In the show , there was an early - warning “ Supper at Emmaus ” — representing Jesus , who has appeared as a stranger to his disciples after his death , being recognized at the moment when he breaks bread for them . )
Informed opinion consigned van Meegeren to the always populous ranks of the formerly promising .
He evoked the setback poignantly in his public confession , in 1945 : “ Driven into a state of anxiety and depression due to the all - too - meager appreciation of my work , I decided , one fateful day , to revenge myself on the art critics and experts by doing something the likes of which the world had never seen before . ”
That ’s rubbish , if only because the “ something ” to which van Meegeren referred — his invention of a new Vermeer style — was just the latest chapter in a then still unknown , long - running criminal enterprise .
Lopez affirms that van Meegeren was dirty before his artistic reputation collapsed .
He speculates — reasonably , to my mind — that faking ruined the artist ’s creativity .
“ Slowly but surely , the imitative logic of forgery condemned Van Meegeren to a state of arrested development , ” Lopez writes .
The state of being oneself dies when set aside .
Lopez dates van Meegeren ’s initiation into The Hague ’s underworld of art swindlers to 1920 , at the latest .
He was mentored by a dealer and painter , Theo van Wijngaarden , who had apprenticed in chicanery with a titan : Leo Nardus .
Nardus stuck American millionaires with innumerable old copies , fresh fakes , and fanciful misattributions of famous artists until 1908 , when a panel of invited experts , including Bernard Berenson and Roger Fry , convened at the home of the Philadelphia streetcar magnate P. A. B. Widener and concluded that his collection was worth about five per cent of what Nardus had charged him for it .
( Found out but unexposed — to spare Widener and other duped moguls public embarrassment — Nardus was left free to indulge his passions for chess and swordsmanship ; he won a bronze medal in fencing for the Dutch team at the 1912 Olympics . )
The hardly less resourceful van Wijngaarden , on his own , perfected a paint medium , gelatin glue , to finesse a standard test for the age of oil paint : rubbing with alcohol , which dissolves oils that have had less than decades to dry .
( The glue weathers alcohol but , as was later discovered — too late for a generation of marks — softens on contact with another chemical compound : water . )
Van Wijngaarden maintained a network of well - placed accomplices , extending to London and Berlin , who could pilot fakes into the mainstream of respectable commerce .
He lacked only top - drawer product .
He himself painted well , but not well enough .
He wanted an adept protégé , and he found him in van Meegeren , who was ready .
Soon after arriving in The Hague , van Meegeren had cast off Anna and the children and taken up with the raffish Johanna de Boer , the actress wife of a friend .
She became his complaisant partner for life and , in 1928 , his second wife , apparently indulgent of his extravagant and libertine ways , as well as his alcoholism , which became full - blown in the early nineteen - thirties .
During the war , van Meegeren even maintained a separate house , in Amsterdam , for partying , where , it was reported , prostitutes were encouraged to grab jewels from an opened strongbox on their way out .
Johanna is frustratingly shadowy in both books .
What she knew of her husband ’s crimes need n’t be plumbed .
Starting in the nineteen - twenties , his spasmodic income , which added up to millions of pre-inflation dollars , would have spoken for itself .
After 1932 , the couple inhabited houses on the French Riviera , where van Meegeren could more easily evade questions about his mysterious wealth .
But Johanna ’s point of view would be fascinating grist — for a novel , if not enough is discoverable to flesh out a biography .
The same can be said of several supporting players in the comedy .
Dolnick gratifies a reader ’s side - long interest with piquant accounts of , among others , the gulled Bredius , a gay , once brilliant aesthete , living in splendor in Monaco , with an insatiable ache for prestige , and Joseph Piller , a young Jewish lieutenant and hero of the Dutch Resistance , who arrested van Meegeren — knocking at the door of the artist ’s grand house on May 29 , 1945 — and then , in a fever of vicarious celebrity , became his champion , a seduction trenchantly conveyed by Lopez .
( The “ fat , swaggering ” figure of the infinitely grotesque Göring , however , distractingly consumes far more pages in Dolnick ’s narrative than his part warrants . )
“ The second half ?
Yeah , as far as I know they ’re playing the second half . ”

Van Meegeren never admitted having produced any of the known gelatin - glue Vermeers , which included “ The Lacemaker ” and “ The Smiling Girl , ” but he almost certainly did paint them .
Van Wijngaarden steered the pictures to the attention of a revered German connoisseur , Wilhelm von Bode , who was taken in by them — predictably , as they seem to have been created with him in mind .
( “ The Smiling Girl ” echoed a detail of a Vermeer — “ The Girl with a Glass of Wine ” — that Bode had adored since his early youth . )
The always sticky matter of provenance was glossed over with tales of impecunious émigrés from the Russian Revolution — at a time when toppled aristocrats manned hotel doors throughout Europe — and amid expectations that lost works by Vermeer were bound to turn up , several having done so since his rediscovery by a French connoisseur in the eighteen - sixties .
The two paintings were sold to the Pittsburgh banker Andrew Mellon by the magus of Old Master dealers , Joseph Duveen , and adorned the National Gallery in Washington , at one point nervously reassigned to a “ Follower of Vermeer , ” in the nineteen - seventies .
“ The Lacemaker , ” especially , looks silly now , depicting a pert young woman who could be a sidekick of Louise Brooks .
But superior forgeries typically secrete subliminally up - to - the - minute associations , which pass , at first blush , as signs of “ timeless ” genius .
The art historian Max Friedländer , who said , “ Forgeries must be served hot , ” promulgated a forty - year rule — four decades or so being how long it takes for the modern nuances of a forgery to date themselves as clichés of the period in which they were painted .
Duveen was misled , although he was n’t by van Meegeren ’s “ Emmaus . ”
In 1937 , he sent his right - hand man , Edward Fowles , to inspect the painting in Paris .
Fowles cabled , “ PICTURE A ROTTEN FAKE . ”
( Duveen kept the verdict to himself ; saving other dealers from disgrace did n’t figure in his business plan . )
Both books vivify the wild - and - woolly milieu of Jazz Age dealing in old art .
Barely professionalized , and with museum science still primitive , the trade relied on the often snap judgments of glorified amateurs , of whom even the loftiest ( even Berenson ) were goof - prone — Duveen had earlier spurned “ Girl with the Red Hat , ” the only true Vermeer to emerge in the twenties .
Dolnick is good on van Meegeren ’s studio practice , which kept pace with scientific progress .
Mediocre old paintings , from the prolific Dutch Golden Age , were cheaply available , as grounds to paint on ; but the overnight creation of a convincingly antique paint surface was a challenge .
Van Meegeren ’s late fakes deploy Bakelite , which , as a liquid medium , hardens with heat and stands up to almost any solvent .
He learned , with difficulty , to make an ancestor of modern plastics ape the fluency of oils .
Many failed experiments led at length to a proper blend , with admixed floral oils , and the correct baking recipe .
“ Emmaus , ” a big picture , would have been larger , but the old painting , on its original stretchers , that van Meegeren bought for the job would n’t fit in his makeshift oven .
As a matter of course , he used only pigments that were available to Vermeer , and concocted effects of age : craquelure , wormholes , yellowed varnish , soilage , and , for good measure in “ Emmaus , ” a poorly repaired rip .
He turned negligent in subsequent works .
Göring ’s canvas , “ Christ and the Adulteress , ” employs cobalt blue , a nineteenth - century innovation in paints , and it is carelessly drawn , with anatomical solecisms in the figures .
But van Meegeren no longer had to evoke Vermeer .
It was enough that the hand that painted the works plainly be the same that had painted “ Emmaus . ”
In 1945 , his captor , Joseph Piller , had him paint a valedictory Vermeer , putatively to settle doubts of his confession but really , Lopez establishes , as a publicity stunt .
That showpiece , “ Christ in the Temple , ” strikes me , in reproduction , as by far the most fetching of the lot , garnished with a droll anachronism : Jesus holds forth over an opened Bible .
Time - travelled to recent years , van Meegeren would have made an upstanding postmodernist .
In the nineteen - thirties , painting Vermeers became less of a problem for van Meegeren than legitimatizing them .
Having drifted out of touch with complicit intermediaries , he came into his own as a con man , tricking innocents into bringing his goods to market .
The patsy for “ Emmaus ” was a Liberal State Party parliamentarian , Gerard A. Boon , who had led the successful fight for woman suffrage in the Netherlands and was a fierce critic of Nazi Germany .
Van Meegeren convinced this good man that the painting belonged to a Dutch family living in Italy , who , persecuted by the Fascist authorities , desperately needed funds for an escape to America .
The rest was intricate but , once Bredius was on board , smoothly managed .
Boon ’s receptiveness to van Meegeren is a puzzle , given Lopez ’s insistence that the artist was an arch ultra-rightist .
But his case seems solid .
For three years , starting in 1928 , in The Hague , van Meegeren published a scurrilous magazine , De Kemphann ( The Fighting Cock ) , in which , Lopez writes , he “ denounced modern painting as ‘ art - Bolshevism , ’ described its proponents as a ‘ slimy bunch of woman - haters and negro - lovers , ’ and invoked the image of ‘ a Jew with a handcart ’ as a symbol for the international art market . ”
He execrated van Gogh in particular .
In 1945 , while van Meegeren was imprisoned , an awkward item turned up in Hitler ’s private library at the Reich Chancellery , in Berlin : a deluxe volume of poems by a Dutch Nazi poet , illustrated by van Meegeren and inscribed , in German , “ To my beloved Führer in grateful tribute , from H. van Meegeren , Laren , North Holland , 1942 . ”
Van Meegeren acknowledged the signature but theorized that a German officer must have penned the dedication , even though the handwriting was clearly the same .
At his trial on an open - and - shut charge of forgery , all such matters were ignored .
Urges to go easy on van Meegeren seem to have afflicted ordinarily sensible people — Dolnick among them , in much of his book — as if by hypnosis .
Lopez advances a sophisticated and troubling answer to the question that is most likely to baffle us :
How could anyone , for an instant , have taken “ Emmaus ” to be a work by Vermeer ?
I remember being stupefied , many years ago , when , ignorant of van Meegeren , I came upon the painting in the Boijmans .
It seemed not only unlike Vermeer but unlike anything this side of a thrift shop .
I missed stylistic cues that both Lopez and Dolnick describe , mainly the borrowed composition of a 1606 “ Emmaus ” by Caravaggio .
This planted secret thrilled scholars who had been debating possible Italian influences on Vermeer , one writer having gone so far as to wonder if a lost work might be found to prove the connection .
Vermeer was known to have painted one Biblical scene — “ Christ in the House of Mary and Martha ” ( 1654 -55 ) — why not another ?
He was , and still is , suspected of having been a closet Catholic , embracing a faith , his wife ’s , that was banned in Delft .
Both the character and the obscure provenance of “ Emmaus ” made sense if it had been created for one of Delft ’s clandestine Catholic churches .
But that does not explain the enthusiasm of credulous aesthetes for a dismal painting .
Lopez deduces a blind spot in our art - historical knowledge and , indeed , in our larger comprehension of European culture between the World Wars .
We may easily peg the party - girl mien in “ The Lacemaker ” and the longueur of another van Meegeren triumph , “ The Girl with a Blue Hat , ” bought by the major collector Baron Heinrich Thyssen , which merits its sobriquet , “ The Greta Garbo Vermeer . ”
But the period accent of “ Emmaus ” escapes us .
It ’s Volksgeist , Lopez argues .
“ Folk spirit ” has a long genealogy of relatively benign synonyms , such as “ national character . ”
Hegel promoted it as a force in history .
But the idea generated new , dark energies in the prewar period .
Styles of heavily expressive , soulful celebrations of common people were prevalent in Germany .
Unlike the better - known socialist realism , with its crisp paeans to the proletariat , Volkisch art cultivated painterly effects to stir both Christian and pagan mystical associations , favoring peasant scenes and such themes as familial devotion and earth - mother fecundity .
Besides tapping that vogue , van Meegeren pandered to an eagerness , among rightist critics , to winkle out Germanic roots of classical Dutch art .
He seems to have modelled the head of Christ , in his “ Emmaus , ” on a self - portrait by Dürer — a recondite proof of influence that he could count on experts to notice .
Lopez argues that the determined suppression , after the war , of anything with a Nazi odor — and a chronic lack of appetite for the material ever since — leaves us blinking at hints of a style that was second nature in Europe seventy years ago .
The contemporary resonance surely startled viewers at the time , but , rather than raise eyebrows , it enlarged the sense of Vermeer ’s greatness .
It seemed more than conceivable that a genius of his calibre could foreshadow future sensibilities as , say , Leonardo da Vinci is routinely credited with having done .
Lopez ’s exegesis of Nazi - tinged artistry is hard to absorb , without nausea , in the way that Leni Riefenstahl ’s “ Triumph of the Will ” is hard to watch .
But an empathetic grasp of that time ’s susceptibility to van Meegeren ’s bait brings the climactic scene of his trial , in Amsterdam , in October , 1947 , to life .
Apparently , by 1947 , the Dutch were not only tired of the war but tired of being tired of it , too .
After a paroxysm of angry revenge on collaborators , they craved a carnival .
Van Meegeren became a giddy nation ’s “ Lord of Misrule , ” Lopez writes .
Brushed aside were treasonous commissions for the Occupation and dealings with the vilest of local quislings — mainly the art commissioner Ed Gerdes , a zealous anti-Semite — and with Alois Miedl , a Bavarian banker who became Göring ’s man in the Dutch art world , energetically plundering Jewish collections .
Van Meegeren ’s humiliation of so many stuffed shirts , Nazi and otherwise , was too pricelessly funny to be marred by stale grudges .
The trial took place in a courtroom hung with “ Emmaus ” and other van Meegeren hoaxes .
Superfluously , the artist having confessed , technical experts presented charts , graphs , and slides of a new test that proved the works ’ recent manufacture .
Van Meegeren fulsomely congratulated the men on their ingenuity .
The faking of Old Masters would henceforth be impossible , he said .
Courtroom onlookers clapped and whistled .
I imagine , extrapolating from Lopez , that their pleasure went beyond jolly Schadenfreude .
Seeing the celebrated paintings exposed as fraudulent may have enabled a purge of formerly impressive symbols .
The auratic Christ and the wonderstruck disciples turned farcical .
The slim , silver - haired van Meegeren , dapper in a blue serge suit , seems to have read the mood ( whatever it was ) perfectly and to have milked it for advantage .
He had done the Vermeers only to prove himself , he testified , hewing to what Lopez calls “ the master - forger - as - misunderstood - genius storyline , ” which the prosecution failed to deflate .
At one point , the judge hazarded a skeptical note : “ You do admit , though , that you sold these pictures for very high prices ? ”
Van Meegeren ’s answer cracked up the room : “ I could hardly have done otherwise .
Had I sold them for low prices , it would have been obvious they were fake . ”
He could get away with anything : “ I did n’t do it for the money , which brought me nothing but trouble and unhappiness . ”
Just one witness , an art historian who had been active in the Resistance , hinted at shady aspects of van Meegeren ’s wartime conduct .
The artist countered with a mocking , nonsensical cross-examination , to the audience ’s delight .
The witness , Lopez writes , “ smiled in a self - deprecating way and then wisely dropped the subject .
Clearly , the day belonged to the master forger . ”
Cheering fans greeted van Meegeren when he emerged from the court .
He was sentenced to a year in prison and forfeiture of his wealth ( except for a sizable chunk that he had settled on Johanna by the legal stratagem of divorcing her ) .
He died two months later , of heart failure — probably , Lopez reports , as a complication of syphilis .
He was fifty - eight years old .
Lopez , though intent on proving van Meegeren a skunk , ca n’t deny him a parting note of admiration : “ To give him his due , he was indeed a truly brilliant fraud . ”
Art forgery is among the least despised of crimes , except by its victims — the identity of those victims being more than exculpatory , for many people .
Art is unique among universally esteemed creative fields in its aloofness from a public audience .
Its economic base is a club of the wealthy , who share power to impose or repress value with professional and academic élites .
Lopez ’s muckraking of van Meegeren scants a fact that Dolnick merrily exploits : the forger gratifies class resentment precisely because he is a pariah .
Unlike the subversive gestures of a Marcel Duchamp , say , his outrages will not become educational boilerplate in museums and universities .
They are impeccably destructive , tarring not only pretensions to taste but the credibility of taste in general .
The spectre of forgery chills the receptiveness — the will to believe — without which the experience of art cannot occur .
Faith in authorship matters .
We read the qualities of a work as the forthright decisions of a particular mind , wanting to let it commandeer our own minds , and we are disappointed when it does n’t .
If we are disappointed enough , when the named artist is familiar , we get suspicious .
But we can never be certain in every case that someone — a veiled mind — is n’t playing us for suckers .
Art lovers are people who brave that possible chagrin . ♦

The U.S. government is looking to launch a new and powerful weather satellite that will be better able to pinpoint where hurricanes and tornadoes may strike .
The Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellite , called GOES-R , will possess technologies not found in weather satellites such as the ability to photograph hurricane storm tracks every 30 seconds and capture images of cloud - to - cloud lightning that can precede tornadoes .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) will award the contract for the nearly $ 8 billion system in December .
" If you tighten the error associated with the storm track , that means fewer people you have to evacuate , which saves money , and getting the timing right saves lives , " said Mike Ruggles , program director for the Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellite at Raytheon .
Raytheon is one of two companies competing to process the data produced by the satellite .
Ruggles said he hopes the satellite will give a five - day hurricane forecast the accuracy of a three - day forecast .
Jeff Masters , director of meteorology at private forecasting company Weather Underground , agreed the satellite will provide better short - term predictions about a storm 's intensity .
He said he does not believe that the satellite will improve landfall predictions for hurricanes by more than " another few percent . "
The $ 7.6 billion system , which includes ground support and two satellites , is scheduled to be launched in 2015 .
NASA has been launching weather satellites since the 1950s .
Current satellites , which orbit at an altitude of 22,300 miles over the same spot , have been in space since the early 1980s , and will quit working soon because of old age .
The new satellites will scan the continental USA every five minutes , compared with every 15 minutes now .
It will take a snapshot of a storm area every 30 seconds , compared with every 7.5 minutes now , says Steve Goodman , NOAA 's program scientist for GOES -R .
The lightning mapper , a first , will help forecasters predict tornadoes that often form in severe thunderstorms , said NOAA .
Most tornado warning times , now 13 minutes on average , will grow by 50 % , Goodman says .
" Anytime you can have more accurate information and have more time to prepare for a potential strike of a hurricane will be beneficial , " says Mark Sloan , emergency management coordinator for Harris County , Texas .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
At 107 , Frank Buckles must know there is not much time for him to honor the memory of his comrades who served the United States during the first World War .
He 's the last surviving U.S. veteran of what then was called the Great War .
Frank Buckles is 107 years old and the last surviving U.S. veteran of World War I .
The old soldier came to Washington on Tuesday hoping to turn a run-down local memorial on the National Mall into something in keeping with other , permanent monuments to Americans who 've sacrificed in other wars .
He 's getting help from a Texas congressman who said he found the condition of the site deplorable .
At a news conference with Buckles on Tuesday , Rep . Ted Poe said he has introduced the " Frank Buckles World War I Act " to renovate and expand the memorial within the next few years .
Poe , a Republican , said his bill would " give this memorial energy , and will be incorporated in a grander , better memorial for all that served in World War I . "
The price of the initial renovations would be around $ 1 million , Poe said , and the site eventually would be upgraded to a national memorial , though design details have n't been determined .
The memorial is currently not national , having been built primarily to honor about 500 veterans from the District of Columbia .
Buckles , who left the Army as a corporal , first visited the gazebo - style structure in March .
He told reporters Tuesday that he does not think it 's too late to acknowledge the sacrifice of all Americans from that war .
" I think they should be honored by their representatives , " Buckles said from his wheelchair .
" I am a representative of World War I , simply through longevity . "
Also pushing the overhaul and upgrade are the D.C. Preservation League and the World War I Memorial Foundation .
The site of the current monument -- in dense woods not far from the fresh and elaborate World War II memorial -- is hard to find , even in the dead of winter , when Buckles last visited .
" We just saw it through the trees , " tourist Regina Duffy said in March .
" I was surprised when we got over here that it was a World War I memorial , because I thought it would be more prominent . "
With summer foliage fully in bloom , the city 's monument is almost completely obscured .
Zeke Musa of Florida said it " looks like it 's been neglected . "
" If you just look at the walks here , all the stones are broken and everything .
These guys served their country , you know ?
It 's a shame , " said Musa , a Vietnam veteran .
According to an autobiography released this year by the Pentagon , Buckles was eager to join the war .
Although only 16 in the summer of 1917 , he lied about his age to get into the armed services .
He said his recruiter told him " the Ambulance Service was the quickest way to get to France , " so he took training in trench casualty retrieval .
Buckles was an officer 's escort in France before joining a detail transporting German prisoners of war .
He now lives on his family 's cattle farm near Charles Town , West Virginia .
All About World War I
The President appeared on television last night in front of a view of an open doorway in the White House .
He was there to warn Americans that we face a long period of recession and financial difficulty in which we will not be able to borrow money or send our kids to college .
He said our retirement funds will be losing value and our futures will be dark and gloomy - unless we jump on board with his Wall Street rescue package .
His initial proposal was that we simply hurry up and give over $ 700 billion with no questions asked .
After some bipartisan hesitation , he became more flexible , but we 're supposed to ignore the fact that his first version unconstitutionally gave him Godlike power over America 's taxpayers and most powerful investment banks without oversight or recourse .
His next proposal conceded CEO accountability , oversight and other compromises , but he still needs passage of the package really , really quick .
He also told us he 's still a believer in free market Darwinism , but he needs us to sign off on this fast !
Congress is sharply divided but constituents are clearly against it , flooding Congressional calls centers and literally taking to the streets in protest .
No , Bush did not take any responsibility for steering us into this pickle in the first place .
Indeed , this power and money grab is eerily reminiscent of the misguided invasion of Iraq .
He convinced the American people to trust him on a few fundamental points : Iraq had WMD and was determined to attack America , and the resultant clean - up would be quick , easy and inexpensive .
Bush bullied past the official UN weapons inspectors report or Saddam 's imminent surrender and rammed the war through the complicit House and Senate .
Bush scared us then , telling us Saddam meant to put biological death germs into warheads and launch them from mobile murder factories .
He told us we faced grave , immediate danger .
It took years to unravel Bush 's misinformation , but we know today everything he said was categorically false and we today as a people struggle to extricate ourselves from the Iraqi quagmire , militarily and financially .
With all credibility blown , Bush comes to us again with his hand out , shirking responsibility for his stewardship of our financial markets and condescendingly explaining the " problem " to us as if it was a natural disaster that just blew in from Kansas .
Bush needed to humbly admit his part if he wanted any credibility last night .
With this kind of pathological arrogance , DC - watchers cannot deny the suspicious nature of Bush 's claims , particularly the nightmare scenario painted for America 's middle class .
As Bush explained , we need these businesses to administer loans to us .
If they go belly up , it will be harder for us all to get credit .
But the government - run Fed loans these entities billions all day ( and in the case of bail outs , simply hands them money ) .
Why should n't the government just loan money directly to the people ?
Because that would be socialism - up until recently , a dirty , filthy word .
Even though the problem is all based in ill - advised individual mortgages , Bush still sees sprinkling cash onto the middlemen as the solution , having learned nothing from this raging crisis .
Another solution making the rounds is using the bad securitized debts as collateral for government provided lines of credit which teetering firms can use to regain liquidity .
Then , the assets can be carefully examined by both borrower and lender to untangle the slop and tabulate value and liabilities .
As someone who does n't push around paper for a living , I could care less if these firms tank .
I 'd welcome reverting back to more of a manufacturing and service economy because the three generations of suits passing around the same money has finally found the end of the middleman profiteering , overfishing the pond .
Our dollar is worth less , our goods made less valuable and we 're paying extra for " speculation " in our energy and commodity costs .
This is all a last - ditch effort for Bush - friendly corporations to take one last payday before the next administration begins real reform .
Especially if this is going to be the end of the line for war profiteers , crony contracts and good old boy glad - handing , it 's Bush 's one last push to enrich fatcats before he is rideen out on a rail .
The coordination between the McCain campaign and the Bush White House is plain out there .
Last night Bush used the term " people from all backgrounds " to mislead viewers , trying to make it sound like he means " everyone " through sly word parsing .
The McCain campaign was recently exposed using the exact same expression in an ad to insinuate Obama 's tax increases would affect many , though saying " people from all backgrounds " technically could mean very few people .
This is the Karl Rove fingerprint , converging at once the Office of the President ( and Vice President ) , the McCain campaign , the Fox media empire , the neocon caucus in Congress , the talk radio personalities , powerful mega- church pastors and a menagerie of corporate execs , lobbyists and " special interest " operatives sympathetic to those raiding taxpayers and their as - yet unborn children and grandchildren for the last eight years .
Along with the Sarah Palin media sideshow , it 's an amazing blend of reality - TV , non-reality - based politics , media manipulation , diseased ethics and non -stop gimmicks , stunts and threats designed to scare you and then offer you hope .
This is right in line with the teachings of the original master of mass manipulation , Edward Bernays , who , in private , said people are simply stupid .
The Queens narcotics officers under investigation for framing four men in a drug bust could get seven years in prison if they ’re brought up on criminal charges , according to law - enforcement sources .
The three undercover cops – Henry Tavarez , Steven Anderson and Alan Figueroa – could be hit with perjury , official misconduct and filing false documents charges stemming from the Jan. 4 incident inside Club Delicioso , sources said .
Video footage from the Elmhurst club exonerated the four men arrested and contradicted the officers ’ claims that they had purchased two bags of cocaine from the quartet .
“ These were nice people in the middle of something that was non-existent , ” a law - enforcement source familiar with the case told The Post .
Tavarez and Figueroa were placed on modified duty Wednesday .
Anderson has since left the NYPD to join the Nassau County police .
Sources said some of the officers have already started speaking with Internal Affairs .
Prosecutors have also begun a review of all their arrests .
“ No one should be shocked by this , ” said Brad Wolk , a lawyer representing the accused men .
“ The narcotics investigation system is out of control . ”
The probe is the latest black mark on the Organized Crime Control Bureau , which oversees narcotics , vice and auto crimes :
* In January , the OCCB took a hit when Queens detective Wayne Taylor was busted for pimping teen girls , authorities said .
* Also that month , Brooklyn South Narcotics Detective Sean Johnstone and Officer Julio Alvarez were caught allegedly keeping drugs seized during arrests .
* In March , a Queens narcotics detective was suspended after shooting at a parked car holding an unarmed man and woman during a foot chase .
Though no one was injured , the incident was an eerie reminder of the shooting of Sean Bell and two of his friends by a Queens vice unit in November 2006 .
* A month ago , a Manhattan South narcotics sergeant was suspended after owners of a club raided accused him of stealing from their register .
Footage inside the club shows the sergeant going behind a cashier and picking an unidentified item off the ground .

IN the wake of Russia ’s ruthless invasion of Georgia , the United States sent relief supplies on military aircraft and ships .
Our vice president went to Tbilisi .
And we promised a billion dollars in reconstruction aid .
The European Union sent a get - well card .
With no return address .
Washington asked that Georgia and Ukraine be put on the fast track to NATO membership to deter further Russian aggression .
The EU suggested sending unarmed civilian observers , instead .
The Bush administration begged for a unified front against Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ’s barbarism .
Rejecting any penalties for Russia , the EU took the bold step of postponing talks on a trade deal .
Within the EU , Britain and Poland insisted that Russia needed a good slap for its latest strategic tantrum .
Other Europeans found that ill mannered .
As I ’d predicted , the Europeans found the rape of Georgia an embarrassment , nothing more .
The odious former German chancellor , Gerhard Schroeder , even took Russia ’s side .
( Of course , Schroeder also took a highly paid job with Russian energy interests , so he may not have been entirely impartial . )
Back when the United States went ahead with the liberation of Iraq over protests from France and Germany – whose corporations made money off Saddam – Washington was damned for going it “ alone . ”
Now , as we try to build a consensus to respond to brutal aggression , the same countries want no part of it .
( Financial interests are involved again – this time , it ’s gas , not oil . )
Russians are not by nature disposed to much happiness , but Putin and his paladins must be downright gleeful .
The tragedy is that the West could have made Putin pay .
And we did n’t need a military confrontation .
We needed unity .
Together , the Euro - American democracies had the power to inflict serious economic and political pain on the Putin regime .
But Europe lacks a conscience – and , without Europe , we lack the clout .
This is all going to end badly .
Putin ’s feeling invincible now , and , just to keep in practice , he ’s gone back to killing journalists who criticize the czar .
Last week saw the murder of two more Russian - citizen media figures .
Magomed Yevloyev , a Web - site publisher from Ingushetia , was abducted from a commercial airliner by the police .
The cops shot him and dumped his body .
Two days later , TV reporter Abdulla Alishayev was shot and killed in the nearby “ republic ” of Daghestan .
Russian government sources blame “ Wahhabis . ”
Plus , a reporter and editor , Milosla Bitokov , from the Karbardino - Balkar “ republic , ” was beaten so badly he had to be hospitalized .
But , given all the journalists Putin has murdered since he came to power , a few broken bones or a fractured skull hardly count .
This recent violence suggests an effective response to resurgent Russian imperialism : Each of those journalist critics of the Putin regime came from a different , but equally restive , province on the northern slopes of the Caucasus .
( Historically , Daghestan was a tougher nut for czarist troops to crack than Chechnya . )
The dominant Muslim populations – and some Christians – in the region view today ’s ethnic - Russian presence as an unbroken extension of Soviet and czarist tyranny .
And the locals are tough customers – even Stalin could n’t break their will completely .
Given Putin ’s brutality and the belligerent threats from his gang ( including Flunky , the eighth dwarf , a k a President Dmitri Medvedev ) , it may be time to dust off our anti-Soviet strategy from Afghanistan : Arm and fund militant separatist movements in the Russian - occupied Caucasus .
Yes , there are risks .
Some of those local nationalists are also Islamists .
Well , just do n’t give them another batch of stingers until they can prove they ’ve expended the previous lot .
Sometimes , the best way to take down Lucifer is to back Beelzebub .
Let ’s face it :
We ’ve got Islamist extremism on the defensive .
That ’s one thing the Bush administration got right .
The Muslim - terrorist problem will be with us to some degree for years to come , but it ’s not remotely as great a threat as a resurgent militarist Russia bristling with missiles and led by a reincarnation of Ivan the Terrible .
The Russians chose to play hardball with Georgia , a democracy allied to the United States .
They won the first inning .
Now it ’s time to dust off our Louisville Sluggers .

Earlier this afternoon I wrote about the ACORN story and the right ’s effort to lie to people and fool them into thinking this has anything to do with voter fraud .
This email just came in from TPM Reader DW …
McCain ’s team has been pushing it on reporters today and just put out one of the most obvious web videos yet .
I say “ obvious ” because the implication of the 24/7 Fox coverage is made blatant .
It ’s transference .
It ’s saying to white voters , “ we know you ’re angry about the economy .
Do n’t blame Wall Street .
Blame the n—–s . ”
McCain ’s going to lose , and he knows it .
This is a 90 - second ad aimed at the base who are watching Fox News .
But he ’s setting up a large proportion ( maybe the majority ) of the GOP base to believe that scary blacks stole the election for Barack Obama .
He ’s stoking race hatred .
He is scum , and if in 10 years his name is n’t synonymous with Lester Maddox and George Wallace than historians wo n’t have done their job .
It ’s really true .
The essence of McCain ’s campaign now appears to amount to prepping McCain ’s base to believe they did n’t really lose the election .
The election was stolen from them by Barack , his army of gangsters and black street hustlers , and possibly Osama bin Laden too .
Socks and Barney chronicled the 2008 election through the eyes of the Presidential Pets — specifically Bill and Hillary Clinton ’s pet cat , Socks , and George W. Bush ’s pet dog , Barney .
Chock full of spectacular insights such as “ President Bush is an idiot ” and “ Democrats could n’t pass the salt with three branches of government , ” you too will find yourself – as tens of faithful readers had – commenting to your friends , co-workers and subscribers to your Myspace updates , “ Check out this comic .
It ’s kind of hit or miss and I do n’t get the Tom Tancredo jokes but look , a talking pig ! ”
The Socks and Barney comic strip ran from late 2007 until inauguration day in January , 2009 .
A collection of Socks and Barney strips called Death Panels was published in 2008 .
Karl Rove said this morning that John McCain 's attacks against Barack Obama have stretched the truth .
Appearing on " Fox News Sunday , " Rove said McCain had " gone one step too far , and sort of attributing to Obama things that are , you know , beyond the 100 percent truth test . ”
McCain has come in for scathing criticism from many in the media and independent fact - check organizations for his recent hard - edged campaign tactics .
But few Republicans , and none as prominent as Rove , have criticized McCain .
The former political adviser to President Bush did n't confine his critique to McCain , though .
" Both campaigns are making a mistake , and that is they are taking whatever their attacks are and going one step too far , " he said .
" They do n't need to attack each other in this way . "
On a new Obama ad released late last week , Rove said it was a fair point to call McCain " a longtime Washington insider . ”
“ But they then say he does n't … send e-mail .
Well , this is because his war injuries keep him from being able to use a keyboard .
He can't type .
You know , it 's like saying he can't do jumping jacks . "

The Real McCain :
John McCain has not yet released his medical records to the public .
McCain is 72 years old , and has been diagnosed with invasive melanoma .
In May of this year , a small group of selected reporters were allowed to review 1,173 pages of McCain 's medical records that covered only the last eight years , and were allowed only three hours to do so .
John McCain 's health is an issue of profound importance .
We call on John McCain to issue a full , public disclosure of all of his medical records , available for the media and members of the general public to review .
You can sign the petition at The Real McCain to ask that McCain disclose his records properly .
Granted , I 'm not 72 years old , but I have had some fairly serious medical issues in my time and am the owner of a not insubstantial medical record myself .
The very fact that his medical records for the last 8 years alone total over 1,000 pages gives me pause .
It absolutely is in the public interest to know exactly what his health outlook is over the next four years .

( Updates with comments from Communist Party magazine in paragraphs 4 and 14 - 16 )
BEIJING , Sept 17 ( Reuters ) - Threatened by a “ financial tsunami , ” the world must consider building a financial order no longer dependent on the United States , a leading Chinese state newspaper said on Wednesday .
The commentary in the overseas edition of the People ’s Daily said the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc “ may augur an even larger impending global ‘ financial tsunami ’ . ”
The People ’s Daily is the official newspaper of China ’s ruling Communist Party , and the overseas edition is a smaller circulation offshoot of the main paper .
Its pronouncements do not necessarily directly voice leadership views .
But the commentary by a professor at Shanghai ’s Tongji University , as well as an essay in a Party journal , underscored official alarm at the turmoil in world financial markets .
China ’s central bank earlier this week cut its lending rate for the first time in six years , a move analysts said was aimed at bolstering the economy and the battered stock market .
“ The eruption of the U.S. sub - prime crisis has exposed massive loopholes in the United States ’ financial oversight and supervision , ” writes the commentator , Shi Jianxun .
“ The world urgently needs to create a diversified currency and financial system and fair and just financial order that is not dependent on the United States . ”
But Vice Premier Wang Qishan , on a visit to the United States , told U.S. trade officials in a meeting on Tuesday that China and the United States needed to maintain close economic ties with global markets going through such turbulence .
“ The Chinese government is well aware of the fact that the United States , which is the world ’s largest developed country , and China , which is the world ’s largest developing country , should have constructive and cooperative economic and trade relations , ” he said .
China is a major buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds , and through its sovereign wealth fund it has taken stakes in two large U.S. financial institutions .
In July 2005 , China revalued the yuan and freed it from a dollar peg to float within managed bands .
But the yuan and China ’s trade remains tightly linked to the fortunes of the dollar .
The commentary suggested China must brace for grave economic fallout and look to alternatives , saying the crisis brings to mind the Great Depression of the 1930s .
“ Lehman Brothers announced bankruptcy will not only have a domino effect on the global financial world , it will bring a shock to the world economy , ” the front - page comment stated .
In the Chinese Communist Party ’s chief ideological magazine , Seeking Truth , a deputy governor of the Agricultural Bank of China , Luo Xi , warned that the U.S. crisis and consequent slump will have a “ serious impact on our country ’s export sector . ”
In this week ’s issue of the magazine , Luo said China must beware of the loose currency policies , poor regulation and reckless credit he blamed for America ’s crisis .
With China also worried about excessive real estate investment and speculation , the U.S. troubles “ serve as a particular warning for our country ’s macro-economic policies and micro investment decisions , ” Luo wrote .
( Reporting by Chris Buckley ; Editing by Ken Wills )
In the past month , both Venezuela and Bolivia expelled the American ambassadors to their countries .
Not only did Brazil , thought to be among America ’s strongest allies in the region , support the expulsion by Bolivia , a major source of natural gas , but Mr. da Silva also railed against an American naval presence in the region , warning that his nation needed to put its own warships on alert in response .
Such anti-American sentiment reflects a longstanding bitterness over Washington ’s economic prescriptions for Latin America , policies that some countries in the region blame for undercutting them .
As Wall Street itself started to unravel , some leaders seemed to feel vindicated by the collapse .
“ We are witnessing the First World , which at one point had been painted as a mecca we should strive to reach , popping like a bubble , ” Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , Argentina ’s president , said two weeks ago .
But the financial crisis has exploded far beyond Wall Street .
Whipsawing global markets are already having a ripple effect across Latin America .
As nervous investors pulled money out of emerging markets , Brazil ’s currency , the real , plunged 16 percent against the dollar last month , resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses at large food and eucalyptus - pulp exporters that placed bad bets on the direction of the real .
In Mexico , falling remittances from the United States are also raising concern , with Finance Minister Augustín Carstens warning that money sent home from across the border could decline by $ 2.8 billion , or 8 percent , this year .
In Venezuela , a sharp drop in the value of the country ’s bonds in the last two weeks reflects fears about plunging oil prices , especially since the United States remains by far the largest buyer of Venezuelan oil despite the deterioration of relations between the countries .
The issue , economists say , is largely about access to credit , which is needed to keep Latin America ’s export - oriented economies humming along .
“ The credit crunch and the liquidity constraints we are seeing are going to affect everyone in the world , ” said Alfredo Coutiño , a senior economist at Moody ’s , the credit - rating agency .
“ That means that the cost for Latin American companies , particularly for those with the need for external funds , is going to be higher . ”
It 's actually even bigger than previously understood .
Yesterday , I linked to stories alleging up to 40 percent of the financing for the California proposition to strip gay couples of their right to marry was coming from LDS Church members .
Now , the numbers claimed by the opponents of Proposition 8 are even higher - more like a staggering 77 percent :
Californians Against
Hate released figures Tuesday showing that $ 17.67 million was contributed by 59,000 Mormon families since August to groups like Yes on 8 .
Contributions in support of Prop. 8 total $ 22.88 million .
Additionally , the group reports that Mormons have contributed $ 6.9 million to pass a a similar law , Proposition 102 , in Arizona ...
Karger said Californians Against
Hate came up with the figures by cross-referencing donor information from the California secretary of state with Brigham Young University alumni lists , church memberships , and other personal documentation that could identify Mormon Church members .
He said the surge in support has been an attempt to boost the church 's social standing among the greater religious community .
" For whatever reason , they 're trying to get some respect from other religions , " he told The Advocate Tuesday .
" They 've always been looked down upon by the Christians , the Catholics , and evangelicals . "
Success with the marriage amendment would give the church credibility , Karger said .

This is about consolidating the Mormon church into the wider Christianist movement .
If the Mormons can prove their anti-gay mettle , they will be less subject to suspicion from evanglicals .

Researchers have been experimenting for some time with the idea that biology can be harnessed to perform computations .
Biological systems can amplify and sample a large collection of molecules simultaneously , and they can register states that are far more subtle and complex than the binary ones handled by standard computers .
Although there are no clear cases where a biological computer will outperform standard silicon , a biological computer may be useful for detecting the state of other biological systems , and it may find uses in diagnostics or environmental sensing .
A potential step forward for biological computing was just reported in Science , where researchers describe logic gates built from RNA , a chemical the helps run the basic metabolism of the cell .
RNA is a close cousin to the more famous DNA , differing only by the presence of one oxygen atom in its component sugars .
Although it acts much like DNA and undergoes base pairing , that oxygen atom makes it significantly more reactive .
RNA molecules can twist to form elaborate structures that can catalyze chemical reactions , including those that rearrange RNA molecules ( either themselves or others ) .
In the new experiment , researchers built their logic gates using a type of catalytic RNA called a " hammerhead ribozyme . "
Image : UCSB chemistry .
As seen here , the hammerhead RNA undergoes base pairing with itself to form a complex , three - dimensional structure .
Place the hammerhead sequence within any RNA molecule and it will break up the RNA to cut itself neatly out , leaving the RNA molecule in pieces .
The ribozyme is flexible enough that extra RNA can be inserted into one or both of the two lobes of the structure shown above without destroying its function .
The researchers inserted RNA sequences that also formed base paired structures .
With the additional sequences in place , the entire molecule acted like a switch : if it base pairs one way , a normal , functional hammerhead ribozyme was formed .
If it pairs up using different stretches of RNA , parts of the ribozyme are pulled open , destroying its function .
The authors arranged it so that they could control this switch .
Several RNA sequences have been identified that bind small molecules , like the drug tetracycline .
The authors inserted these into the extended lobes , such that the drug controlled the folding of the RNA .
When tetracycline is present , the RNA would fold so that there was no active ribozyme .
Remove the tetracycline , and the molecule would reshuffle so that the ribozyme became active .
The end result is that the drug acts as a switch , turning the ribozyme on and off .
Making each of the two lobes sensitive to a different drug even created a biological AND switch ; both drugs need to be present for an active ribozyme .
But a ribozyme is n't necessarily easy to detect , so the authors made it obvious : they inserted their logic gates into a gene that encodes a messenger RNA that produces the Green Fluorescent protein ( the protein that recently won folks a Nobel Prize ) .
Now , when the ribozyme is active , the messenger RNA gets broken up and no GFP is made ; otherwise , the cells glow green .
This setup allowed the creation of an OR logic system as well .
Simply placing two ribozymes in the same message , each sensitive to a different drug , ensured that no GFP was made if either drug was present .
By combining different versions of these structures in a gene encoding a single messenger RNA , all sorts of basic logical operations were possible , and their state was easy to read out based on whether the yeast cells carrying these genes glowed green or not .
Detecting tetracycline is n't especially interesting , but RNA that binds to specific small molecules is actually relatively easy to make ; repeated rounds of amplification and selection for binding can evolve these RNAs in a couple of days .
This means that , in a matter of days , researchers can grow yeast colonies that glow in response to a variety of chemicals , or even to combinations of chemicals .
More complicated circuits should be possible if the ribozymes are inserted into messenger RNAs that encode transcription factors , which could , in turn , regulate genes that encode yet other ribozymes .
It 's possible that the first biological calculations using this system are already under way in the lab responsible for this publication .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
In the corporate world , Richard Fuld Jr. , the 62 - year - old chief executive of bankrupt investment bank Lehman Brothers , was known as “ the gorilla ” for his imposing presence and pugilistic style .
As one of Congress ’ most feared inquisitors , Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) has his own talent for making people squirm in their seats .
When the two came face to face on Monday , for a hearing on Lehman ’s sudden mid-September demise , there was some expectation that the proceedings could turn combative .
Though Waxman lived up to his populist firebrand reputation , it was a subdued and ( to an extent ) contrite Fuld who testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform — not the aggressive executive who once brawled with another parent at his son ’s hockey game .
“ I want to be very clear I take full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took , ” Fuld began .
“ Based on the information I had at the time I believe that these decisions were both prudent and appropriate .
With the benefit of hindsight , would I have done things differently ?
Yes , I would have .
I feel horrible about what ’s happened to the company and its effects on so many . ”
But even while assuming responsibility , Fuld cast his firm — and by extension himself — as the victim of a “ tsunami ” of unprecedented market forces , uncooperative regulators , rampant “ false rumors , and , ultimately , a crisis of confidence .
“ We did everything we could to protect the firm , ” Fuld told the committee in prepared remarks .
“ We raised capital .
We made changes to our senior management team and reduced expenses .
We sought strategic investors for a sale of all or part of the firm .
We called on regulators to clamp down on abusive short selling practices . ”
He added , “ In the end , despite all of our efforts , we were overwhelmed . ”
Waxman , though , was n’t having any of this .
Convening the first of five scheduled hearings on the financial industry meltdown , he painted the 158 - year - old investment bank and its CEO as the perpetrators , not victims , of the market volatility .
“ While Mr. Fuld and other Lehman executives were getting rich , they were steering Lehman Brothers and our economy towards a precipice , ” Waxman said , adding that the firm ’s collapse may have “ triggered the credit freeze that is choking our economy ” and led to the $ 700 billion bailout package approved by Congress last week .
Lehman Brothers , he said , was “ a company in which there was no accountability for failure . ”
Underscoring his point are a number of internal Lehman documents that the firm handed over to the committee , which in turn provided them to the press .
One of them is a June 3 , 2008 , email from executives at Neuberger Berman , Lehman ’s money management subsidiary , recommending that “ top management should forgo bonuses this year .
This would serve a dual purpose .
Firstly , it would represent a significant expense reduction .
Secondly , when the ‘ world ’ discovers this in next year ’s proxy , it would send a strong message to both employees and investors that management is not shirking accountability for recent performance . ”
This suggestion received a prompt response from George H. Walker , President George W. Bush ’s cousin , who was a member of Lehman ’s executive committee .
“ I am not sure what ’s in the water at 605 Third Avenue … ” — where Neuberger is headquartered .
He continued , directing his comments to Lehman executives cc’d on the original message : “ I ’m embarrassed and I apologize . ”
He described the “ compensation issue ” as one that was “ hardly worth the EC ’s [ executive committee ’s ] time . ”
Later that day , Fuld weighed in .
“ Do n’t worry — they are only people who think about their pockets , ” he wrote , apparently referring to the Neuberger execs .
Attempting to illustrate Lehman ’s profligate ways , congressional Democrats also highlighted a memo sent by the firm ’s human resources manager days before Lehman filed for bankruptcy .
Directed to the Lehman board members who served on the company ’s compensation committee , the memo recommended that three departing executives receive “ special payments ” totaling more than $ 23 million .
( Two of the three executives under consideration for these multimillion - dollar payouts had been fired , including Andy Morton , the one - time head of Lehman ’s Global Fixed Income division . )
“ In other words , ” Waxman said , “ even as Mr. Fuld was pleading with Secretary Paulson for a federal rescue , Lehman continued to squander millions on executive compensation . ”
From 2004 to 2007 , as Lehman posted record - breaking profits , the firm paid out more than $ 16 billion in bonuses .
Since 2000 , Fuld received nearly a half - billion dollars in compensation , according to the oversight committee .
Fuld disputed the committee ’s figure , but acknowledged it was “ still a large number . ”
Perhaps vying for a bit of sympathy , Fuld told the panel that “ no one had more incentive to see Lehman Brothers succeed ” than he did , pointing out that he had owned some 10 million shares of Lehman stock , now essentially worthless , when the company went under .
“ I believed in this company , ” he said .
Even as investors had begun to lose confidence in Lehman ’s financial position , sending the firm ’s stock value tumbling , Fuld and other Lehman executives expressed optimism about the company ’s prospects .
“ Our capital and liquidity positions have never been stronger , ” Fuld told investors during a June conference call .
As recently as September 10 , Lehman ’s chief financial officer told investors , “ Our capital position at the moment is strong . ”
“ If you ’re Richard Fuld , how do you lose all common sense ? ” asked Rep. John Sarbanes ( D - Md. ) .
Answering his own question , Sarbanes suggested that Fuld had either been woefully out of touch with his firm ’s financial health — or was attempting to “ deceive ” shareholders .
For his part , Fuld acknowledged that “ with the benefit of hindsight , I can now say that I and many others ” — including Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , he was quick to point out — ” were wrong . ”
But he insisted that he and other Lehman executives “ did not mislead our investors …
We made disclosures that we believed were accurate . ”
Damaging Fuld ’s claims that Lehman was simply caught unaware by a financial maelstrom is a confidential company analysis , drafted in 2008 , that notes that the company “ saw warning signs ” but “ did not move early / fast enough . ”
The analysis also states that Lehman did not exercise “ enough discipline about capital allocation . ”
According to the Wall Street Journal , the FBI is probing whether Lehman executives misrepresented the firm ’s financial position to investors .
To the Republican members of the oversight committee , who bickered with Waxman throughout the hearing , Fuld was not the only Gorilla in the room .
Reps. John Mica ( R - Fla . ) and Christopher Shays ( R - Conn . ) questioned why Waxman had chosen to focus on Lehman Brothers , rather than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , “ the government - sponsored enterprises , ” or GSE ’s , which Republicans say have been at the center of the mortgage crisis .
“ I believe there ’s a cover - up going on and I ’d like to make a statement , ” a flustered Shays said at the start of the hearing , before being gaveled down by Waxman .
He later remarked , “ We are not confronting the 800 - pound gorilla in the room .
We are not confronting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
When it comes to Fannie and Freddie , lobbyists manipulated legislators on both sides of the aisle …
Why are we looking at everyone else except for Congress ? ” Addressing Fuld , Mica chimed in , “ If you have n’t discovered your role , you ’re the villain .
You have to act like the villain . ”
But Fuld did n’t quite play the part of villain or scapegoat .
He told the committee , “ I can look at you and say , ‘ This is a pain that will stay with me the rest of my life , regardless of what comes out of this committee , and regardless of what the record book will say when it ’s finally written . ' ”
In the end , he seemed as baffled and distraught by the economic crisis as anyone else .
After earning hundreds of millions of dollars as a top investment bank executive , he could not say exactly what had gone wrong or why no one had seen it coming until it was too late .
He was vague on what to do next .
Coming from Fuld , once one of the crown princes of Wall Street , this was as revealing as it was frightening .

The Truth About Russia in Georgia
TBILISI , GEORGIA – Virtually everyone believes Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili foolishly provoked a Russian invasion on August 7 , 2008 , when he sent troops into the breakaway district of South Ossetia .
“ The warfare began Aug. 7 when Georgia launched a barrage targeting South Ossetia , ” the Associated Press reported over the weekend in typical fashion .
Virtually everyone is wrong .
Georgia did n't start it on August 7 , nor on any other date .
The South Ossetian militia started it on August 6 when its fighters fired on Georgian peacekeepers and Georgian villages with weapons banned by the agreement hammered out between the two sides in 1994 .
At the same time , the Russian military sent its invasion force bearing down on Georgia from the north side of the Caucasus Mountains on the Russian side of the border through the Roki tunnel and into Georgia .
This happened before Saakashvili sent additional troops to South Ossetia and allegedly started the war .
Regional expert , German native , and former European Commission official Patrick Worms was recently hired by the Georgian government as a media advisor , and he explained to me exactly what happened when I met him in downtown Tbilisi .
You should always be careful with the version of events told by someone on government payroll even when the government is as friendly and democratic as Georgia's .
I was lucky , though , that another regional expert , author and academic Thomas Goltz , was present during Worms ' briefing to me and signed off on it as completely accurate aside from one tiny quibble .
Goltz has been writing about the Caucasus region for almost 20 years , and he is n't on Georgian government payroll .
He earns his living from the University of Montana and from the sales of his books Azerbaijan Diary , Georgia Diary and Chechnya Diary .
Goltz experienced these three Caucasus republics at their absolute worst , and he knows the players and the events better than just about anyone .
Every journalist in Tbilisi seeks him out as the old hand who knows more than the rest of us put together , and he wanted to hear Patrick Worms ' spiel to reporters in part to ensure its accuracy .
“ You , ” Worms said to Goltz just before he started to flesh out the real story to me , “ are going to be bored because I 'm going to give some back story that you know better than I do . ”
“ Go , ” Goltz said .
“ Go . ”
The back story began at least as early as the time of the Soviet Union .
I turned on my digital voice recorder so I would n't miss anything that was said .
Patrick Worms
“ A key tool that the Soviet Union used to keep its empire together , ” Worms said to me , “ was pitting ethnic groups against one another .
They did this extremely skillfully in the sense that they never generated ethnic wars within their own territory .
But when the Soviet Union collapsed it became an essential Russian policy to weaken the states on its periphery by activating the ethnic fuses they planted .
A poster on a wall in Tbilisi , Georgia
“ They tried that in a number of countries .
They tried it in the Baltic states , but the fuses were defused .
Nothing much happened .
They tried it in Ukraine .
It has not happened yet , but it 's getting hotter .
They tried it in Moldova .
There it worked , and now we have Transnitria .
They tried it in Armenia and Azerbaijan and it went beyond their wildest dreams and we ended up with a massive , massive war .
And they tried it in two territories in Georgia , which I 'll talk about in a minute .
They did n't try it in Central Asia because basically all the presidents of the newly independent countries were the former heads of the communist parties and they said we 're still following your line , Kremlin , we have n't changed very much . ”
He 's right about the massive war between Armenia and Azerbaijan , though few outside the region know much about it .
Armenians and Azeris very thoroughly transferred Azeris and Armenians “ back ” to their respective mother countries after the Soviet Union collapsed through pogroms , massacres , and ethnic - cleansing .
Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled savage communal warfare in terror .
The Armenian military still occupies the ethnic - Armenian Nagorno - Karabakh region in southwestern Azerbaijan .
It 's another so - called “ frozen conflict ” in the Caucasus region waiting to thaw .
Moscow takes the Armenian side and could blow up Nagorno - Karabakh , and subsequently all of Azerbaijan , at any time .
After hearing the strident Azeri point of view on the conflict for a week before I arrived in Georgia , I 'd say that particular ethnic - nationalist fuse is about one millimeter in length .
“ Now the story starts really in 1992 when this fuse was lit in Georgia , ” Worms said .
“ Now , there 's two territories .
There 's Abkhazia which has clearly defined administrative borders , and there 's South Ossetia that does n't .
Before the troubles started , Abkhazia was an extremely ethnically mixed area : about 60 percent Georgian , 20 percent Abkhaz , and 20 percent assorted others – Greeks , Estonians , Armenians , Jews , what have you .
In Ossetia it was a completely integrated and completely mixed Ossetian - Georgian population .
The Ossetians and the Georgians have never been apart in the sense that they were living in their own little villages and doing their own little things .
There has been inter-marriage and a sense of common understanding going back to distant history .
The Georgians will tell you about King Tamar – that 's a woman , but they called her a king – and she was married to an Ossetian .
So the fuse was lit and two wars start , one in Abkhazia and one in South Ossetia . ”
Georgia
South Ossetia is inside Georgia , while North Ossetia is inside Russia .
“ The fuse was not just lit in Moscow , ” he said .
“ It was also lit in Tbilisi .
There was a guy in charge here , Zviad Gamsakhurdia , a little bit like [ Serbian Nationalist war criminal in Bosnia Radovan ] Karadzic .
He was a poet .
He was an intellectual .
But he was one of these guys who veered off into ethnic exclusivism .
He made stupid declarations like Georgia is only for the Georgians .
If you 're running a multi-ethnic country , that is really not a clever thing to say .
The central control of the state was extremely weak .
The Russians were trying to make things worse .
There was a civil war between Georgians and Tbilisi .
But the key thing is that here there were militias , Georgian militias , and some of them pretty nasty . ”
Thomas Goltz
Thomas Goltz then interjected his only critique of Patrick Worms ' explanation of events that led to this war .
“ It started in 1991 , ” he said , “ but it went into 1992 and 1993 , as well . ”
Then he turned to me .
“ This guy , [ Zviad ] Gamsakhurdia , was driven from power from across the street .
They bombed this place . ”
He meant the Marriott Hotel .
We stood in the lobby where Worms had set up his media relations operation .
“ There 's a horrible picture in my Georgia book of this facade . ”
“ Of this building ? ” I said .
Marriot Hotel ( right ) , Tbilisi , Georgia
“ Yeah , ” Goltz said .
“ That was December 1991 .
He fled in December 1991 . ”
“ Where did he go ? ” I said .
“ To Chechnya , ” Goltz said .
“ Of course .
He led the government in exile until he came back in 1993 then died obscurely in the mountains , of suicide some people say , others say cancer .
Then he was buried in Grozny . ”
He turned then again to Patrick Worms .
“ 1991 , ” he said .
“ Not 1992 . ”
“ 1991 , ” Worms said .
“ Okay . ”
So aside from that quibble , everything else Worms said to me was vouched for as accurate by the man who literally wrote the book on this conflict from the point of view of both academic and witness .
“ So in 1991 , ” Worms said , “ things here explode .
And basically it gets pretty nasty .
Thomas can tell you what happened .
Read his book , it 's worth it .
And by the time the dust settles , there are between 20,000 and 30,000 dead .
Many atrocities committed by both sides , but mostly – at least that 's what the Georgians say – by the Abkhaz .
And the end result is everybody gets kicked out .
Everybody who is not Abkhaz or Russian gets kicked out .
That 's about 400,000 people .
250,000 of those still live as Internally Displaced Persons within Georgia .
As for the rest : the Greeks have gone back to Greece , the Armenians to Armenia , some Abkhaz to Turkey , etc .
Abkhazia ( upper left )
“ When it 's over , ” he said , “ you 've got two bits of Abkhazia which are not ethnic Abkhazia .
You 've got Gali district which is filled with ethnic Georgians .
And you 've got the Kodori Gorge which is filled with another bunch of Georgians .
So there the end result was a classic case of ethnic - cleansing , but the world did n't pay much attention because it was happening at the same time as the Yugoslav wars .
Ossetia was different .
Ossetia also had a war that started about the same time , and it was also pretty nasty , but it never quite succeeded in generating a consolidated bit of territory that Ossetians could keep their own .
When the dust settled there , you ended up with a patchwork of Georgian and Ossetian villages .
Before the war , Ossetians and Georgians lived together in the same villages .
After the war they lived in separate villages .
But there were still contacts .
People were talking , people were trading .
It was n't quite as nasty as it was in Abkhazia .
“ Now fast forward to the Rose Revolution , ” he said .
The Rose Revolution was a popular bloodless revolution that brought Georgia 's current president Mikheil Saakashvili to power and replaced the old man of Georgian politics Eduard Shevardnadze who basically ran the country Soviet - style .
“ The first thing that Misha [ Mikheil Saakashvili ] did was try to poke his finger in [ Russian President Vladimir ]
Putin 's eyes as many times as possible , ” Worms said , “ most notably by wanting to join NATO .
The West , in my view , mishandled this situation .
America gave the wrong signals .
So did Europe . ”
“ Can you elaborate on that a bit ? ” I said .
“ I will , ” he said .
“ But basically the encouragement was given despite stronger and stronger Russian signals that a Georgian accession to NATO would not be tolerated .
Fast forward to 2008 , to this year , to the meeting of NATO heads of state that took place in Bucharest , Romania , where Georgia was promised eventual membership of the organization but was refused what it really wanted , which was the so - called Membership Action Plan .
The Membership Action Plan is the bureaucratic tool NATO uses to prepare countries for membership .
And this despite the fact that military experts will tell you that the Georgian Army , which had been reformed root and branch with American support , was now in better shape and more able to meet NATO aspirations than the armies of Albania and Macedonia which got offered membership at the same meeting .
Tbilisi , Georgia
“ Just a little bit of back story again , in July of 2007 Russia withdrew from the Conventional Forces Treaty in Europe .
This is a Soviet era treaty that dictates where NATO and the Warsaw Pact can keep their conventional armor around their territories .
Russia started moving a lot of materiel south .
After Bucharest , provocations started .
Russian provocations started , and they were mostly in Abkhazia .
“ One provocation was to use the Russian media to launch shrill accusations that the Georgian army was in Kodori preparing for an invasion of Abkhazia .
Now if you go up there – I took a bunch of journalists up there a few times – when you get to the actual checkpoint you have a wall of crumbling rock , a wooden bridge , another wall of crumbling rock , a raging torrent , and a steep mountainside filled with woods .
It 's not possible to invade out or invade in unless you 've got air support .
Which is why the Abkhaz were never able to kick these Georgians out .
They just kept that bit of territory . ”
He paused and looked over at Thomas Goltz as though he was bracing for a critique .
“ I 'm just doing what I 've done already , ” he said , “ but this time I 'm getting advice from an expert on how I 'm doing . ”
Thomas Goltz silently nodded .
Tbilisi , Georgia
“ Kodori provocations , ” Worms continued , “ and other provocations .
First the Russians had a peacekeeping base under a 1994 agreement that allowed them to keep the peace in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
They added paratroopers , crack paratroopers , with modern weaponry there .
That does n't sound a lot like peacekeeping .
A further provocation : they start shooting unmanned Georgian aircraft drones out the sky .
One of them was caught on camera by the drone as it was about to be destroyed .
The United Nations confirmed that it was a Russian plane that did this .
It probably took off from an airbase that the Russians were supposed to have vacated a few years ago , but they never let the OSCE [ Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ] in to check .
“ The next provocation : On April 16 Putin signs a presidential decree recognizing the documents of Abkhazians and South Ossetians in Russia and vice versa .
This effectively integrates these two territories into Russia 's legal space .
The Georgians were furious .
So you have all these provocations mounting and mounting and mounting .
Meanwhile , as of July , various air corps start moving from the rest of Russia to get closer to the Caucasus .
These are obscure details , but they are available .
A poster on a wall in Tbilisi , Georgia
“ Starting in mid July the Russians launched the biggest military exercise in the North Caucasus that they 've held since the Chechnya war .
That exercise never stopped .
It just turned into a war .
They had all their elite troops there , all their armor there , all their stuff there .
Everyone still foolishly thought the action was going to be in Abkhazia or in Chechnya , which is still not as peaceful as they 'd like it to be .
“ The Georgians had their crack troops in Iraq .
So what was left at their central base in Gori ?
Not very much .
Just Soviet era equipment and not their best troops .
They did n't place troops on the border with Abkhazia because they did n't want to provoke the Abkhaz .
They were expecting an attempt on Kodori , but the gorge is in such a way that unless they 're going to use massive air support – which the Abkhaz do n't have – it's impossible to take that place .
Otherwise they would have done it already .
“ So fast forward to early August .
You have a town , Tskhinvali , which is Ossetian , and a bunch of Georgian villages surrounding it in a crescent shape .
There are peacekeepers there .
Both Russian peacekeepers and Georgian peacekeepers under a 1994 accord .
The Ossetians were dug in in the town , and the Georgians were in the forests and the fields between the town and the villages .
The Ossetians start provoking and provoking and provoking by shelling Georgian positions and Georgian villages around there .
And it 's a classic tit for tat thing .
You shell , I shell back .
The Georgians offered repeated ceasefires , which the Ossetians broke .
A poster on a wall in Tbilisi , Georgia
“ On August 3 , the head of the local administration says he 's evacuating his civilians .
You also need to know one thing : you may be wondering what these areas live off , especially in Ossetia , there 's no industry there .
Georgia is poor , but Ossetia is poorer .
It 's basically a smuggler 's paradise .
There was a sting operation that netted three kilograms of highly enriched uranium .
There are fake hundred dollar bills to the tune of at least 50 million dollars that have been printed .
[ South Ossetian “ President ” Eduard ]
Kokoity himself is a former wrestler and a former bodyguard who was promoted to the presidency by powerful Ossetian families as their puppet .
What does that mean in practice ?
It means that if you are a young man , you have no choice .
You can either live in absolute misery , or you can take the government 's dime and join the militia .
It happened in both territories .
“ On top of that , for the last four years the Russians have been dishing out passports to anyone who asks in those areas .
All you have to do is present your Ossetian or Abkhaz papers and a photo and you get a Russian passport on the spot .
If you live in Moscow and try to get a Russian passport , you have the normal procedure to follow , and it takes years .
So suddenly you have a lot of Ossetian militiamen and Abkhaz militiamen with Russian passports in effect paid by Russian subsidies .
Tbilisi , Georgia
“ So back to the 3rd of August .
Kokoity announces women and children should leave .
As it later turned out , he made all the civilians leave who were not fighting or did not have fighting capabilities .
On the same day , irregulars – Ingush , Chechen , Ossetians , and Cossacks – start coming in and spreading out into the countryside but do n't do anything .
They just sit and wait .
On the 6th of August the shelling intensifies from Ossetian positions .
And for the first time since the war finished in 1992 , they are using 120 mm guns . ”
“ Can I stop you for a second ? ” I said .
I was still under the impression that the war began on August 7 and that Georgian President Saakashvili started it when he sent troops into South Ossetia 's capital Tskhinvali .
What was all this about the Ossetian violence on August 6 and before ?
He raised his hand as if to say stop .
“ That was the formal start of the war , ” he said .
“ Because of the peace agreement they had , nobody was allowed to have guns bigger than 80 mm .
Okay , so that 's the formal start of the war .
It was n't the attack on Tskhinvali .
Now stop me . ”
“ Okay , ” I said .
“ All the reports I 've read say Saakashvili started the war . ”
“ I 'm not yet on the 7th , ” he said .
“ I 'm on the 6th . ”
“ Okay , ” I said .
He had given this explanation to reporters before , and he knew exactly what I was thinking .
“ Saakashvili is accused of starting this war on the 7th , ” he said .
“ Right , ” I said .
“ But that sounds like complete bs to me if what you say is true . ”
Thomas Goltz nodded .
*
I later met wounded Georgian soldiers in a Tbilisi hospital who confirmed what Patrick Worms had told me about what happened when the war actually started .
I felt apprehensive about meeting wounded soldiers .
Would they really want to talk to someone in the media or would they rather spend their time healing in peace ?
My translator spoke to some of the doctors in the hospital who directed us to Georgian soldiers and a civilian who were wounded in South Ossetia and felt okay enough to speak to a foreign reporter .
Kaha Bragadze
“ Every day and every hour the Russian side lied , ” Georgian soldier Kaha Bragadze said .
“ It must be stopped .
If not today , then maybe tomorrow .
My troops were in our village , Avnevi .
On the 6th of August they blew up our troops ' four - wheel - drives , our pickups .
They blew them up .
Also in this village – it was August 5th or 6th , I can't remember – they started bombing us with shells .
Two soldiers died that day , our peacekeepers .
The Ossetians had a good position on the hill .
They could see all our positions and our villages , and they started bombing .
They went to the top of the hill , bombed us , then went down .
We could n't see who was shooting at us . ”
Kaha Bragadze 's leg wounded by shrapnel from a Russian air strike
“ Which day was this ? ” I said .
“ The 5th or the 6th ? ”
“ I do n't remember , ” he said .
“ But it started that day from that place when two Georgians were killed . ”
“ Were they just bombing you the peacekeepers , ” I said , “ or also civilians and villages ? ”
“ Before they started bombing us they took all the civilians out of their villages , ” he said .
“ Then they started damaging our villages – houses , a gas pipe , roads , yards .
They killed our animals .
They evacuated their villages , then bombed our villages . ”
Another Georgian soldier , Giorgi Khosiashvili , concurred
Giorgi Khosiashvili
“ I was a peace keeper as well , ” he said , “ but in another village .
I was fired upon on August 6th .
On the 5th of August they started shooting .
They blew up our peacekeeping trucks .
They put a bomb on the road and when they were driving they were blown up .
They also mined the roads used by civilians .
On the 6th of August they started bombing Avnevi .
And at this time they took the civilians out of Tskhinvali and sent them to North Ossetia [ inside Russia ] . ”
“ I saw this on TV , ” said Alex , my translator .
“ They took the civilians , kids , women , and put them on the bus and sent them to North Ossetia . ”
A civilian man , Koba Mindiashvili , shared the hospital room with the Georgian soldiers .
He , too , was in South Ossetia where he lived outside Tskhinvali .
Koba Mindiashvili
“ When they started bombing my village , ” he said , “ I was running away and the soldiers wounded me .
They robbed me and shot me in the leg with a Kalashnikov .
I do n't know if it was Russians or Ossetians .
They took my car , took my gold chain , and shot me . ”
“ They did n't care if it was a house or a military camp , ” Giorgi Khosiashvili said .
“ They bombed everything . ”
“ You actually saw this for yourself ? ” I said .
“ Yes , ” he said .
“ I saw it .
It was the Russian military airplanes .
If they knew it was a Georgian village , they bombed all the houses .
Many civilians were killed from this bombing . ”
“ It was Russians or Ossetians who did this ? ” I said .
“ It was Russians , ” he said .
“ The Ossetians do n't have any jets . ”
*
Back at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Tbilisi , Patrick Worms continued fleshing out the rest of the story .
“ Let me tell you what happened on the 7th , ” he said .
“ On the 6th , while this is going on , the integration minister who was until a few months ago an NGO guy and who believes in soft power things , tried to go there and meet the separatist leadership .
The meeting does n't happen for farcical reasons .
The shelling intensifies during the night and there is , again , tit for tat , but this time with weapons coming from the South Ossetian side which are not allowed under the agreement .
By that time , the Georgians were seriously worried .
All their armor that was near Abkhazia starts moving , but they are tanks , they do n't have tank transporters , so they move slowly .
They do n't make it back in time .
On the 7th , this continues .
That afternoon , the president announces a unilateral ceasefire , a different one from the previous ones .
It means I stop firing first , and if you fire , I still wo n't fire back .
That holds until the next part of the story .
Peace vigil , Tbilisi , Georgia
“ On the evening of the 7th , the Ossetians launch an all - out barrage focused on Georgian villages , not on Georgian positions .
Remember , these Georgian villages inside South Ossetia – the Georgians have mostly evacuated those villages , and three of them are completely pulverized .
That evening , the 7th , the president gets information that a large Russian column is on the move .
Later that evening , somebody sees those vehicles emerging from the Roki tunnel [ into Georgia from Russia ] .
Then a little bit later , somebody else sees them .
That 's three confirmations .
It was time to act .
“ What they had in the area was peacekeeping stuff , not stuff for fighting a war .
They had to stop that column , and they had to stop it for two reasons .
It 's a pretty steep valley .
If they could stop the Russians there , they would be stuck in the tunnel and they could n't send the rest of their army through .
So they did two things .
The first thing they did , and it happened at roughly the same time , they tried to get through [ South Ossetian capital ]
Tskhinvali , and that 's when everybody says Saakashvili started the war .
It was n't about taking Ossetia back , it was about fighting their way through that town to get onto that road to slow the Russian advance .
The second thing they did , they dropped a team of paratroopers to destroy a bridge .
They got wiped out , but first they managed to destroy the bridge and about 15 Russian vehicles .
“ The Georgians will tell you that they estimate that these two actions together slowed the Russian advance by 24 to 48 hours .
That is what the world considered to be Misha 's game .
And you know why the world considers it that ?
Because here in South Ossetia was the head of the peacekeeping troops .
He has n't been in Iraq , he 's a peace keeper .
What have they been told for the last four years ?
They lived in a failed state , then there was the Rose Revolution – it was n't perfect but , damn , now there 's electricity , there 's jobs , roads have been fixed – and what the Georgians have had drummed into them is that Georgia is now a constitutional state , a state of law and order .
And everybody here knows that Ossetia is a gangster 's smuggler 's paradise .
The whole world knows it , but here they know it particularly well .
The peacekeepers had a military objective , and the first rule of warfare when you 're talking to the media is not to reveal to your enemy what you 're going to do .
So they were n't going to blather into a microphone and say well , actually , I 'm trying to go through Tskhinvali in order to stop the Russians .
So what did he say instead ?
I 'm here to restore constitutional order in South Ossetia .
And that 's it .
With that , Georgia lost the propaganda war and the world believes Saakashvili started it .
And the rest of the story ... you know . ”
Tbilisi , Georgia
“ Let me make a couple of comments , ” Goltz said .
“ That , ” Worms said , “ to the best of my knowledge , is all true . ”
“ Let 's just start at the ass end , ” Goltz said to me .
“ This is your first time to the lands of the former Soviet Union ? ”
“ Yes , ” I said .
“ The restoration of constitutional order , ” he said , “ may sound just like a rhetorical flourish with no echo in the American mindset .
What it means in the post - Soviet mindset is what Boris Yeltsin was doing in Chechnya .
This was the stupidest phrase this guy possibly could have used .
That 's why people want to lynch him . ”
Goltz was referring to the head of the Georgian peacekeeping forces in South Ossetia .
He turned then to Patrick Worms .
“ Your presentation was deliciously comprehensive .
Perhaps it was ... we 'll ask our new friend Michael ... too much information out of the gate to absorb . ”
“ I absorbed it , ” I said .
“ Okay , ” Goltz said .
“ Am I making any mistakes ? ” Worms said to Goltz .
“ Am I forgetting anything ? ”
“ Well , ” Goltz said , “ there are some details that I would chip in .
Who are the Ossetians and where do they live ?
This is the question that has been lost in all of the static from this story .
This autonomy [ South Ossetia ] is an autonomous district , as opposed to an autonomous republic , with about 60,000 people max .
So , where are the rest of the Ossetians ?
Guess where they live ?
Tbilisi .
Here .
There .
Everywhere .
There are more Ossetians – take a look around this lobby .
You will find Ossetians here .
Of those Ossetians who are theoretically citizens of the Republic of Georgia , 60,000 live there and around 40,000 live here . ”
A roadside cross outside Tbilisi , Georgia
“ What do they think about all this ? ” I said .
“ They 're scared as shit , ” Goltz said .
“ Are they on the side of those who live in South Ossetia ? ” I said .
“ No , ” he said .
“ One of them is Georgia 's Minister of Defense .
[ Correction : Georgia 's Minister of Defense is Jewish , not Ossetian . ]
Georgia is a multi-ethnic republic .
And the whole point of the Ossetian ethnic question is this : South Ossetia is part of Georgia . ”
“ Are reporters receptive to what you 're saying ? ” I said to Worms .
“ Everyone is receptive , ” he said .
“ Everyone , regardless of nationality , even those who love Georgia , genuinely thought Saakashvili started it . ”
“ That 's what I thought , ” I said .
“ That 's what everyone has been writing . ”
Vladimir Putin's face used for hopscotch , Tbilisi , Georgia
“ Yes , ” he said .
“ Absolutely .
We 've been trying to tell the world about this for months .
If you go back and look at the archives you 'll see plenty of calls from the Georgian government saying they 're really worried .
Even some Russian commentators agree that this is exactly what happened .
Do n't forget , they sent in a lot of irregulars , Chechens , Cossacks , Ossetians , Ingush – basically thugs .
Not normal Chechens or Ingush – thugs .
Thugs out for a holiday .
Many Western camera crews were robbed at gunpoint ten meters from Russian tanks while Russian commanders just stood there smoking their cigarettes while the irregulars ... that happened to a Turkish TV crew .
They 're lucky to still be alive .
Some of the Georgians were picked up by the irregulars .
If they happened to be female , they got raped .
If they happened to be male , they got shot immediately , sometimes tortured .
Injured people we have in hospitals who managed to get out have had arms chopped off , eyes gouged out , and their tongues ripped out . ”
Vladimir Putin
Russian rules of engagement , so to speak , go down harder than communism .
And the Soviet era habits of disinformation are alive and well .
“ You also have to remember the propaganda campaign that came out , ” he said .
“ Human Rights Watch is accusing the Russian authorities of being indirectly responsible for the massive ethnic cleansing of Georgians that happened in South Ossetia .
The Ossetians are claiming that the Georgians killed 2,000 people in Tskhinvali , but when Human Rights Watch got in there a few days ago and talked to the hospital director , he had received 44 bodies .
There was nobody left in that town .
Plus it 's the oldest law of warfare : have your guns in populated areas , and when the enemy responds , show the world your dead women and children .
“ Right , ” I said .
“ That goes on a lot where I usually work , in the Middle East . ”
“ Yes , ” he said .
“ That 's exactly what the Russians were doing . ”

Mozilla is considering just two more security updates for Firefox 2.0 before it retires the browser at the end of this year .
" We 're starting to consult the [ development ] community for feedback , " said Mike Beltzner , the director of Firefox , prior to setting a final ' end - of - life ' date .
If all goes according to plan , the last update for the older browser will be Firefox 2.0.0.19 .
The current build of Firefox 2.0 is 2.0.0.17 , which was released last month to patch 14 vulnerabilities .
Mozilla 's policy is to support a browser for six months after it 's been superseded by a new version .
The company unveiled Firefox 3.0 in mid-June ; shortly after that , Mozilla announced that it would stop patching Firefox 2.0 later in the year .
Beltzner confirmed Wednesday that Firefox 2.0 remains on track for retirement by the end of December .
He also noted that a majority of Firefox 2.0 users have taken advantage of an upgrade offer to Firefox 3.0 that Mozilla triggered two months ago .
" Presently two - thirds of our users are using Firefox 3 , with more than 50 % accepting the first major upgrade offer back in late August , " said Beltzner in message posted early Wednesday to the Mozilla site .
One user on the mozilla .
dev. planning message forum asked Beltzner how the end - of - life for Firefox would affect Thunderbird 2.0 , the e-mail client that 's built on the same Gecko foundation as Firefox 2.0 , or other applications , such as SeaMonkey or Camino , also based on Gecko 1.8.1 .
" Based on the current [ Thunderbird 3 ] release planning , [ Thunderbird 3 ] will be released 3 - 4 months after the Gecko 1.8 [ end - of - life ] , when [ Thunderbird 2 ] is still the stable release , " said Simon Paquet .
Thunderbird , which is developed and maintained by Mozilla Messaging Inc. , a Mozilla Corp. spin-off , is considerably behind Firefox in its shift toward version 3.0 , which is based on the Gecko 1.9 tree .
Earlier this month , for example , Mozilla Messaging renamed what had originally been Beta 1 of Thunderbird 3.0 as , in fact , a third alpha .
Previously , Mozilla Messaging had said the first release candidate for Thunderbird 3.0 would likely ship in late January , with a final some time after that .
Currently , the Thunderbird timetable omits any dates after Nov. 18 , when Beta 1 is to enter " code freeze " status .
But the demise of Firefox 2.0 support does n't mean that Thunderbird 2.0 users will be left out to dry , Beltzner said today , making an effort to differentiate work on Firefox from the underlying Gecko engine .
" The end of support for Firefox 2.0 does n't mean that [ developers ] wo n't be able to work on the Gecko code , " he said .
" It just means that our focus wo n't be on actively maintaining that [ 1.8 ] branch [ of Gecko ] . "
Other Mozilla developers had responded previously to Paquet 's concern about a lack of patches for Thunderbird , noting that during earlier end - of - life moves , programmers continued to support the e-mail client .
" Mozilla , in some form , will provide support for Thunderbird based on the official lifecycle policy , like we did for 1.0 and 1.5 , " said Michael Conner , of Mozilla , in a message posted in late September .
" Even after we did the end - of - life for Firefox 1.5 [ in May 2007 ] , developers who were employed by Mozilla Corp. , and members of the Gecko community would respond to patch request from the Thunderbird team , " added Beltzner .

The US Supreme Court has declined to hear the case of a man who was kicked off an American Airlines jetliner in Boston because a flight attendant thought he looked like a Middle Eastern terrorist .
John Cerqueira is an American citizen of Portuguese heritage who was trying to fly home to Fort Lauderdale on Dec. 28 , 2003 .
Instead , he was escorted off the jetliner and questioned by police for two hours because American Airlines personnel thought his dark hair and olive complexion made him look Middle Eastern .
When police realized the mistake , they reported back that Mr. Cerqueira was cleared to travel .
But American refused to issue him a ticket on any of its flights .
Cerqueira sued American Airlines for discrimination and won .
An appeals court in Boston reversed that decision .
On Monday , the Supreme Court announced it would not examine the case .
The justices offered no explanation for their decision .
The action means the appeals court ruling throwing out Cerqueira 's case remains undisturbed .
At issue in the unusual case was a little - known law that authorizes air carriers to refuse to transport any passenger for safety reasons .
Cerqueira 's lawyers say the appeals court decision against their client is a judicial endorsement of discrimination and racial profiling .
" The opinion below protects airline denial - of - service decisions that are based on stereotypes about the propensity of passengers with a Middle Eastern appearance to commit acts of terrorism , " wrote Washington lawyer Michael Kirkpatrick in his brief urging the court to take up the case .
The case lies at the crossroads between the vigorous protection of air carriers in a time of terrorism and strict enforcement of civil rights in a country working to overcome racism .
At issue was whether both can be pursued side - by - side in a jetliner , or whether antidiscrimination laws necessarily must yield to concerns about terrorism .
Cerqueira is not alone in his plight .
Since 2001 , the Department of Transportation has received 953 complaints of discrimination against US airlines , Mr. Kirkpatrick said .
Lawyers for American Airlines said the air carrier and its employees have a duty to protect the lives of all passengers and crew members on their flights .
" If the pilot - in - command of an airliner concludes , based on information that comes to him , that there is or might be a safety hazard aboard his aircraft , [ federal aviation law ] authorizes him to act to protect the safety of the entire aircraft by removing a passenger from the aircraft before flight , " wrote Dallas lawyer Michael Powell in his brief on behalf of American Airlines .
The law does not provide carte blanche to the airlines , however .
Airline officials are barred from exerting this statutory power in ways that are arbitrary or capricious .
Nonetheless , Mr. Powell suggested safety is the paramount consideration .
" The consequences of a timid or wrong decision can be catastrophic , " Powell wrote .
Kirkpatrick disagreed with this approach .
He said American Airlines acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in its treatment of Cerqueira .
The airline 's actions were based solely on racial stereotypes , he said .
Cerqueira first attracted the attention of the flight attendant when he asked if he could change his seat assignment to an exit row .
She told him he'd have to wait until the gate personnel arrived .
The flight attendant later told the captain of Flight 2237 that Cerqueira had been " very hostile and extremely insistent that his seat be switched to an exit row seat , " according to the American Airlines brief .
She later reported ( inaccurately , it turned out ) that although Cerqueira was sitting in coach he had boarded with the first - class passengers .
In addition , the flight attendant reported that upon entering the plane Cerqueira went to a lavatory , where he remained for an extended period .
He then returned to his seat , worked on his computer for a while , and fell asleep .
In the meantime , the pilot sent his copilot back to the lavatory to check for bombs .
No bombs were found .
Next , two other Middle Eastern - looking men , both conversing loudly in a foreign language , sat next to Cerqueira in the exit row .
One of the two men wore a ponytail .
The pilot remembered him .
When the pilot arrived at the gate , the man with the ponytail approached him and asked if he was the captain for the Fort Lauderdale flight .
When the pilot said yes , the passenger responded : " Good .
I 'm going with you .
We 're going to have a good day today . "
The pilot , with 17 years of experience , said it was one of the oddest exchanges he 's ever had with a passenger .
" It concerned me greatly , " he said later .
As the flight was preparing to depart , flight attendants reported that the two Middle Eastern - looking men were acting " bizarrely " and were laughing .
One attendant reported to the pilot that the men did not take the emergency exit - row briefing seriously .
One of them asked during the briefing : " Where do you want me to put the door . "
This was too much for the crew .
The jetliner returned to the gate and all three men in the exit row were escorted off the jet by four uniformed Massachusetts State Police troopers .
During two hours of questioning , the troopers learned that Cerqueira did not know the two other men .
They also discovered that the two men were Israeli .
Police concluded that none of the three were terrorists .
The only connections between the men were their seat assignments and a perception among American Airlines personnel that all three looked Middle Eastern .
When Cerqueira tried to book a seat on the next flight for Fort Lauderdale , American refused to sell him a seat .
His money was refunded and he flew home the next day on a different airline .
Cerqueira sued American for discrimination .
A Boston jury awarded him $ 400,000 in compensatory and punitive damages .
The appeals court reversed the decision and threw out the awards .
American Airlines argued that the courts must consider the propriety of a pilot 's decision not to transport a passenger in light of the cumulative information available to the pilot at the moment of decision – not with the benefit of hindsight and fact checking .
Cerqueira 's lawyers say such an approach to the law amounts to a license to engage in discrimination under the guise of airline safety .

Everyone has a lot of questions about Chrome .
Some people say that it is spyware because each and every character you enter is sent to Google .
Hundreds of comments like this can be found on the web , like this one that says “ Chrome spends nearly as much time phoning home to Google as it does talking to other Web servers . ”
On the other hand , you can also find on the web the opposite opinion that claims “ If you do not wish this data to be sent to your search provider , you have a number of options :
Use incognito mode , turn off search suggestions permanently or change your search provider . ”
Who is correct ?
What kind of information is really traveling between Chrome and Google ?
What data about you is being sent to the web ?
Is it true that Google ’s browser sends details about everything you do ?
Is it an unsafe browser ?
What happens behind Incognito mode ?
The first thing we want to know is “ What information does Chrome send about visited sites to Google ” ?
Many different opinions can be found on the web , and some are really alarming .
One person says that toolbarqueries .
google.com collects everything the browser sends to it .
This is indeed true , and you can see in metrics_service.cc [ chromium.org ] , what information about visited websites is being sent .
Although this only happens if you selected it in Chromes ‘ Under the Hood ’ ( Options ->
“ Help make Google Chrome better by automatically sending usage statistics and crash reports to Google ” ) this option is not selected by default , you have to specifically select it during the Chrome installation .
Using SpyStudio you can be 100 % certain about this by checking and un-checking the option , and watching all the ‘ send ’ function calls .
So , does Google Chrome send information about every website you visit to toolbarqueries.google.com ?
The answer is no , it does it only if you request it to .
This does n’t mean that other information , like the one send to google - analytics , is not being sent anymore .
However it is interesting to notice that this behavior is exactly the same under Incognito mode .
This means that if the option of sending usage statistics is checked , it does n’t matter what mode Chrome is running , the statistics are sent anyway .
We know that the only differences between normal and Incognito modes are the logging of websites visited , files downloaded , download histories and cookies .
So this feature is local to the machine , and nobody has said that statistics are not sent under this mode .
Although I think for many of us , we implicitly assume to be anonymous while running Chrome under Incognito mode .
So we better keep the limitations of this feature in mind !
Again , this only applies when sending statistics option is selected .
The other feature we want to inspect is the suggestion made by the address bar : “ When you type URLs or queries in the address bar , the letters you type are sent to Google so the Suggest feature can automatically recommend terms or URLs you may be looking for . ”
This is highly controversial , we want to know about this feature when using Incognito mode ( in which the suggest feature seems to be automatically disabled ) .
Again we can use SpyStudio to make sure .
You can see that Chrome does not send any information to Google about your key strokes when using Incognito mode .
You can also watch calls to GetAddrInfoW function , which provides protocol - independent translation from a Unicode host name to an address .
When you are not running on Incognito , you can turn this off by right clicking on the address bar and selecting “ Edit search engines … ”
Then uncheck the check box at the bottom labeled “ Use a suggestion service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar ” .
We can now safely stop all the paranoia about Chrome .
We can see the information that Google Chrome sends to Google using SpyStudio and we know that this depends on the options you choose .
So Chrome is not spyware that sends everything you do to Google .
I also believe it is important to understand what features the Incognito mode provides and not assume things about it .
Watch Google Chrome
See for yourself the information that Google Chrome sends to Google .
Use Nektra ’s SpyStudio to monitor Chrome ’s behavior .
It is very easy :
Download SpyStudio from Nektra ’s website free of charge and install it .
Replace the database ‘ deviare.fdb ‘ with a new version .
You will find ‘ deviare.fdb ’ in the path you installed SpyStudio : SpyStudiobin Download the script chromewatcher and then add the path where you saved it to SpyStudio .
Edit -> Preferences ->
Python Run SpyStudio and import the module chromeWatcher by typing “ import chromeWatcher ” in the Python console .
Then start monitoring by calling the Begin ( ) function by typing “ chromeWatcher .
Begin ( ) ” .
Now watch SpyStudio while using Google Chrome to find out what information is sent by Chrome .
What does the ChromeWatcher script do ?
The ChromeWatcher module was specially made to capture calls to the Winsock functions ‘ send ‘ and ‘ WSASend ‘ .
To know where the information is going , a socket connections track must be kept .
So it is necessary to hook ‘ connect ’ and ‘ select ’ functions too .
The idea behind ChromeWatcher is to hook ‘ send ’ and ‘ WSASend ’ calls that are made to Google and show them to you .
To understand better this script you can see SpyStudio documentation on : SpyStudiodoc
“ The fact that there are amateurs and retired professors out there who need access to these chemicals is a valid problem , but there are n’t many of those guys weighed against the possible dangers . ”
“ People who want to make meth will find ways to do it that do n’t require an Erlenmeyer flask .
But raising a generation of people who are technically incompetent is a recipe for disaster . ”
I am among those who think that science has great beauty .
A scientist in his laboratory is not only a technician : he is also a child placed before natural phenomena which impress him like a fairy tale .
