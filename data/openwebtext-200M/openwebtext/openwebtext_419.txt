Bush hails Israelis as ‘ chosen people ’ but ignores Palestinians on ‘ catastrophe ’ day
By Donald Macintyre in Jerusalem
Friday , 16 May 2008
Â© 2008 Independent News and Media Limited
President George Bush lavished anniversary praise on Israel yesterday , as Palestinians commemorated the “ Nakba ” or “ catastrophe ” when 700,000 were forced from or fled their homes 60 years ago .
In a special address to the Israeli Knesset , Mr Bush declared that the US was proud to be the “ closest ally and best friend in the world ” of a nation that was a “ homeland for the chosen people ” and had “ worked tirelessly for peace and … fought valiantly for freedom . ”
And in a speech that linked together Hamas , Hizbollah and al - Qa’ida , the President likened those “ “ including “ good and decent ” people “ “ who urged negotiations with “ terrorists and radicals ” , with supporters of appeasing the Nazis before the Second World War .
On Iran , Mr Bush said that permitting “ the world ’s leading sponsor of terror ” to possess “ the world ’s deadliest weapon ” would be “ an unforgivable betrayal of future generations ” .
Mr Bush ’s speech was notable for only one reference to Palestinian aspirations for a state .
He did not allude to the current negotiations between the Israeli Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , and the Palestinian President , Mahmoud Abbas , on the outlines of two - state solution that he himself helped to kick - start at the Annapolis conference last year .
Instead , his only mention was in a passage envisaging Israel ’s 120th anniversary “ “ 60 years hence “ “ in which Palestinians would have “ the homeland they have long dreamed of and deserved “ “ a democratic state that is governed by law . ”
By that time , he prophesied , the Middle East would consist of “ free and independent societies ” , and Hamas , Hizbollah and al - Qa’ida would have been defeated “ as Muslims across the region recognize the emptiness of the terrorists ’ vision and the injustice of their cause ” .
Nor did Mr Bush make even an oblique reference to the fact that he was delivering his speech on the day that Palestinians annually commemorate the “ Nakba ” in the 1948 war that left a victorious Israel in control of 78 per cent of mandatory Palestine .
As sirens sounded and thousands of black balloons were released across the West Bank , several thousand Palestinians gathered in Ramallah ’ s main Manara Square to hear a taped address by Mr Abbas urging reconciliation and an end to Israeli settlement building in the West Bank to facilitate negotiations on a future state .
“ Sixty years have passed , ” he said .
“ It ’s time to end the Nakba for the Palestinian people . ”
But a Nakba day message from Hamas , which controls Gaza , called on Palestinians to continue “ resistance ” and urged the Palestinian President to “ abandon the illusion of negotiations . ”
At least one Palestinian youth was injured in Gaza after several dozen teenagers broke away at the end of a Hamas - organised protest near the northern Erez crossing .
As youths threw stones , Israeli forces fired live rounds and tear gas .
Three Arab Knesset members were led away before the President ’s speech by security guards after unfurling a banner saying “ We shall overcome . ”
Mr Bush repeated the symbolic oath traditionally uttered by Israeli soldiers at Masada , the fortress where 960 Jews in the first century rebellion against Roman rule committed suicide rather than surrender , and which he had visited yesterday : “ Masada shall never fall again ” .
He added to a standing ovation : “ And America will be at your side . ”
But his speech did not mention the occupation of Palestinian territory since the 1967 war or restate US and international stances critical of Israel “ “ such as demands for settlement outposts to be removed or for expansion of settlements to be halted .
Nor did he mention that those calling for some engagement with Hamas include some former Israeli military and intelligence figures .
Mr Olmert told parliamentarians that he was confident that a peace agreement would “ be approved in the Knesset by a large majority and … supported by the vast majority of the Israeli public ” .
Reuters news agency renewed its demand yesterday for a prompt explanation of why the Israeli military in Gaza fired on one of its cameramen , Fadel Shana , who was killed a month ago today .

While finishing “ Bird - Watcher , ” a Profile of the jazz broadcaster and expert Phil Schaap , I thought it might be useful to compile a list of a hundred essential jazz albums , more as a guide for the uninitiated than as a source of quarrelling for the collector .
First , I asked Schaap to assemble the list , but , after a couple of false starts , he balked .
Such attempts , he said , have been going on for a long time , but “ who remembers the lists and do they really succeed in driving people to the source ? ”
Add to that , he said , “ the dilemma of the current situation , ” in which music is often bought and downloaded from dubious sources .
Schaap bemoaned the loss of authoritative discographies and the “ troubles ” of the digital age , particularly the loss of informative aids like liner notes and booklets .
In the end , he provided a few basic titles from Louis Armstrong , Count Basie , Benny Goodman , Miles Davis , and other classics and admitted to a “ pyrrhic victory . ”
What follows is a list compiled with the help of my New Yorker colleague Richard Brody .
These hundred titles are meant to provide a broad sampling of jazz classics and wonders across the music ’s century - long history .
Early New Orleans jazz , swing , bebop , cool jazz , modal jazz , hard bop , free jazz , third stream , and fusion are all represented , though not equally .
We have tried not to overdo it with expensive boxed sets and obscure imports ; sometimes it could n’t be helped .
We have also tried to strike a balance between healthy samplings of the innovative giants ( Armstrong , Ellington , Parker , Davis , Coltrane , etc. ) and the greater range of talents and performances .
Since the nineteen - seventies , jazz has been branching out in so many directions that you would need to list at least another hundred recordings , by the likes of Steve Coleman , Stanley Jordan , Joe Lovano , Jacky Terrasson , John Zorn , David Murray , Avishai Cohen , Béla Fleck , Eliane Elias , Roy Hargrove , Dave Douglas , Matthew Shipp , Gonzalo Rubalcaba , Fat Kid Wednesdays , and many , many others .
There is a suggestion below of the dazzling scope of contemporary jazz , but the focus is on the classic jazz that is Schaap ’s specialty .
Care e cari , sì , è a voi che ci rivolgiamo , proprio a voi , lettrici e lettori dell ’agenzia , abbonati e sostenitori della rivista perché i padroni di Adista siete voi .

As the price at the gas pump continues to climb , so does the cost of diary , grain and meat products .
Why ?
Because increasing fuel prices make it more expensive to grow , harvest , transport , process and package food .
Indeed , food costs rose by 4 percent in 2007 , the highest annual increase since 1990 [ 1 ] .
In 2008 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts the consumer price index for all food will increase 4.5 to 5.5 percent as retailers continue to pass on fuel costs to consumers [ 1 ] .
There is , however , an upside to the increasing cost of food .
Michael Pollan , author of the book In Defense of Food : An Eater ’s Manifesto , argues that as the price of fuel and commodities rise , nutritionally questionable , high - profit ingredients like high - fructose corn syrup will also cost more [ 2 ] .
And as prices rise , consumer demand for products containing such ingredients will fall .
This is good news for producers of sustainable foods — locally grown produce and locally raised meat — that do n’t rely on fossil fuels .
Locally grown foods are fresher , better tasting and healthier than food that ’s been shipped or flown in from further away ( we wo n’t even discuss heavily processed foods ) .
Sustainable food producers have n’t felt the increasing cost of fuel like factory farms , making them more economically competitive in today ’s marketplace .
Even so , a recent Ohio State University study found that grocery store shoppers are willing to spend more for locally grown foods [ 3 ] .
The study was published in the May issue of the American Journal of Agricultural Economics .
Researchers evaluated data from 477 surveys at 17 Midwestern locations , including retail grocery stores , on - site farm markets and farmers markets .
In the survey , shoppers were presented with two baskets of strawberries under 80 different combinations of price , freshness , farm location and farm type .
After presenting the options , shoppers were asked which basket of strawberries they would buy .
The average retail shopper was willing to pay 48 cents more for strawberries produced locally ( in the study , local meant grown within Ohio ) .
Shoppers at farm markets were willing to pay even more at 92 cents extra .
Freshness was also found to be important factor for shoppers .
Retail shoppers were willing to pay 54 cents more for fresh produce that was recently harvested .
Again , farm market shoppers were willing to pay even more at 73 cents extra .
According to Marvin Batte , Ph.D. , a co-author of the study and professor of Agricultural , Environmental and Development Economics at Ohio State University [ 4 ] :
Statistically , we sorted out what explains each person choosing one basket over the other .
We were able to determine how important price was , how important where the strawberries were produced was and whether the freshness guarantee was a factor .
Basically what made the biggest difference was local production .
The Washington Post ran a great story earlier this week about the benefits of fruit and vegetables .
To Produce Good Health , Bite Into Fruit and Veggies reveals some of the reasons why these food provide so many health benefits .
The article also suggests that fresh fruits and vegetables are inexpensive and more accessible over the summer months :
Scientists are just beginning to fully understand the power of produce .
And the start of summer provides a great opportunity to expand your nutritional horizons by sampling the foods that will come into peak season during the coming months .
Seasonal fruit and vegetables cost less than produce available at other times of year , so they can help stretch your food dollars .
Nobody likes to pay more for food .
But if increased food costs force people to find locally grown alternatives and eat healthier , there is indeed an upside to the high price of food .
For more information on farmers markets , family farms and other sources of sustainably grown food in your area where you can buy locally grown produce and grass - fed meats , visit LocalHarvest.org .

Who 's the Most Important Person of the Twentieth Century ?
I want to scream out " Gavrilo Princip ! "
Here 's a man who single - handedly sets off a chain reaction which ultimately leads to the deaths of 80 million people .
Top that , Albert Einstein !
With just a couple of bullets , this terrorist starts the First World War , which destroys four monarchies , leading to a power vacuum filled by the Communists in Russia and the Nazis in Germany who then fight it out in a Second World War .
Considering that all Princip wanted was to bring Bosnia under Serb control , it 's a bit ironic that after a century of very messy history , it is n't .
Everything about the world has changed drastically over the last century , except that .
Most historians consider this century to have begun in 1914 , so in essence , Gavrilo Princip is the man who created the 20th Century .
Some people would minimize Princip 's importance by saying that a Great Power War was inevitable sooner or later given the tensions of the times , but I say that it was no more inevitable than , say , a war between Nato and the Warsaw Pact .
Left unsparked , the Great War could have been avoided , and without it , there would have been no Lenin , no Hitler , no Eisenhower .
Princip is one of the few individuals ever to make history .
My vote for number two VIP would go to Mikhail Gorbachev , the man who brought the century to an end .
( The photo of Gavrilo Princip was stolen from the World War One Image Archive ) .
What Real Historians Say :
If my opinion is n't good enough for you , then let 's take a look at what other historians have to say .
The best way to do this is to check the indexes to their books .
If the book spends twice as many pages discussing Winston Churchill as it does discussing Margaret Thatcher , then it 's safe to say that this historian thinks Churchill is the more history - worthy of the two .
If an historian spends more time trashing Hitler than he does praising Gandhi , then he considers Hitler more important than Gandhi -- whether he 's willing to admit it or not .
All we have to do is count the index entries for 20th Century VIPs in several history books , average them all out , and we 've got our list .
( If you 'd like more details on my statistical methodology ( and who would n't ! ) , click here . )
RANK NAME SCORE 1 Adolph Hitler 10.05 % 2 Iosif Stalin 6.44 % 3 Mao Zedong 5.26 % 4 Nikita Khrushchev 3.85 % 5 Winston Churchill 3.68 % 6 Franklin Roosevelt 3.56 % 7 Lenin 3.51 % 8 Benito Mussolini 3.25 % 9 Mikhail Gorbachev 3.23 % 10 Charles DeGaulle 3.20 %
The Second World War stands out as the most prominent event of the Century .
Of the 10 most frequently mentioned individuals in recent history , half were leaders of countries during the war , and two others led nationless armies in the war ( Mao & DeGaulle ) .
Although this is sometimes called " The American Century " , it 's clear from the list that professional historians find events in Russia much more interesting than events elsewhere .
Four of our Top Ten are leaders of the Soviet Union .
It 's easy to see why : from the Russian Revolution to Yalta to the Cold War to Glasnost , international relations have often revolved around what mischief the Russians were up to .
Overlapping with this focus on Russian is a focus on the history of Communism .
Let 's move on to the next ten :
RANK NAME SCORE 11 Ch'iang Kai-shek 3.08 % 12 Dwight Eisenhower 2.60 % 13 Ronald Reagan 2.11 % 14 Richard Nixon 1.95 % 15 Woodrow Wilson 1.91 % 16 John F Kennedy 1.80 % 17 James Carter 1.67 % 18 Fidel Castro 1.53 % 19 Gamal Nasser 1.42 % 20 Mohandas Gandhi 1.36 %
Numbers 11 and 12 continue the World War Two grand slam from the top ten , but we 're finally getting a peek at some other trends .
We 've now reached heavy discussion of American history , with six US presidents all in a row .
It 's almost as if no two historians can agree on who the second most important US president of this century has been ; however , this sudden flood of lightweights has no - doubt has caused you to wonder where Theodore Roosevelt is .
( as in " Carter !?
You put Carter ahead of Teddy Roosevelt ?
What kind of a pinhead are you ? " )
Good question .
Historians generally begin the 20th Century with the First World War , so TR misses out .
Also at this level , we 've reached the first of our VIPs to not rule a country - Gandhi .
Also , our highest ranked Moslem ( Nasser ) and our highest Latin American ( Castro )
Now for the next ten :
RANK NAME SCORE 21 Harry Truman 1.13 % 22 Leon Trotsky 1.07 % 23 Leonid Brezhnev 1.01 % 24 Francisco Franco .98 % 25 Tito .93 % 26 Lyndon Johnson .92 % 27 Jawarharlal Nehru .87 % 28 Neville Chamberlain .86 % 29 John Maynard Keynes .83 % 30 Douglas MacArthur .79 %
We 've picked up three more non-heads of state -- Trotsky , Keynes and MacArthur -- but by now you 're probably noticing that everyone on the list is a politico of some sort , even the ones who are n't actually rulers .
Well , that 's what historians focus on .
Sure , they might toss in a few token chapters on the arts and sciences , but when they do , they usually discuss anonymous trends rather than individual acomplishments .
On to the next ten :
RANK NAME SCORE 31 John Foster Dulles .79 % 32 Nikolai II .73 % 33 Kemal Mustafa Ataturk .70 % 34 William Clinton .67 % 35 Theodore Roosevelt .66 % 36 George Bush .66 % 37 Henry Kissinger .62 % 38 Anthony Eden .60 % 39 Erich von Ludendorff .59 %
Once we reached number 30 , we got to the point where the margin of error is almost the same as the score itself , so you should be careful about reading too much into this batch , but now 's probably the time to point out that among the 50 people that historians go on and on about , not one is a woman .
While you 're pondering the implications of that [ n.1 ] , we 'll move on to the next batch , which is interesting because we finally -- finally -- get to see other fields of human endeavor besides killing people and bossing them around :
RANK NAME SCORE 40 Henry Ford .55 % 41 Albert Einstein .55 % 42 James Joyce .54 % 43 Harold Macmillan .54 % 44 Conrad Adenauer .53 % 45 David Lloyd George .52 % 46 Hafez Assad .50 % 47 Anwar Sadat .46 % 48 Alfred Hitchcock .45 % 49 Pablo Picasso .45 % 50 Sigmund Freud .44 %
So it looks like Picasso is the top painter of the century , Joyce the top writer , Hitchcock the top film maker , Ford the top businessman , Einstein the top scientist , and Freud the top figurer - out of people .
If we want to allocate the scores of the top 50 according to nation , we get this heirarchy :
Have you noticed yet that none of these people are Japanese ?
Most historians treat the Japanese as a hive with no discernable individuals .
This is an oversight which you should probably rectify if you 're planning to write a history of the 20th Century .
It 's not that I 'm being PC ; it 's just that I 'm curious how the Japanese got to be such big shots .
If we group our top leaders by political system we 've got :
So the next time that you hear someone complain that Fascism gets all the bad press , while no one ever publicizes the sins of Communism , you can tell them that they 're mistaken ; the average history of the Twentieth Century gives Communism 3 pages of coverage for every 2 pages it gives Fascism .
Popular Culture
So far , I 've been using serious pipe - puffing scholars to determine who the century 's big shots have been , but now let 's apply that same analysis to books which are directed at the popular market .
I averaged out a few not - quite - academic lookbacks at the 20th Century : David Wallechinsky's Twentieth Century : History With the Boring Parts Left Out ( 1995 )
( 1995 ) People Weekly's : The Most Intriguing People of the Century ( 1997 )
( 1997 ) Time : Great Events of the 20th Century ( 1997 ) ... and got this list :
Rank Name Score 1 Adolf Hitler 4.99 % 2 John F. Kennedy 3.47 % 3 Winston Churchill 3.39 % 4 Franklin Roosevelt 3.05 % 5 Martin Luther King 3.04 % 6 Richard Nixon 2.92 % 7 Marilyn Monroe 2.72 % 8 Albert Einstein 2.30 % 9 Ronald Reagan 2.06 % 10 Elvis Presley 2.03 % 11 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis 1.82 % 12 Charlie Chaplin 1.78 % 13 Theodore Roosevelt 1.77 % 14 Mao Zedong 1.74 % 15 Harry Truman 1.48 % 16 Charles Lindbergh 1.45 % 17 Iosif Stalin 1.42 % 18 Robert Kennedy 1.39 % 19 John Lennon 1.37 % 20 Pablo Picasso 1.31 %
Now , these are the faces we think of when somebody says " Twentieth Century " , not Jawarharlal Nehru or John Maynard Keynes .
We picture Martin Luther King telling everyone that he has a dream ; Marilyn Monroe 's dress billowing in the breeze ; Winston Churchill flashing us an inspirational V for Victory ; John F. Kennedy at the Vienna Wall declaring " Ich bin ein Wiener ! " ; Harry Truman 's dress billowing in the breeze .
Sure we do n't know much history , but these images are n't history ; they 're the mythology of our times .
Notes :
[ n.1 ]
" ... not one is a woman . "
It 's probably rather rude for me to bring up this question without even trying to answer it myself , so my take on this is that women have generally been forbidden or discouraged from participating in the more history - worthy professions such as politics , business and the military .
In fields which are considered more ladylike , such as literature , women have proven every bit as productive as men .
For example , women ( Harper Lee , Alice Walker , Margaret Mitchell , Toni Morrison ) wrote 4 of the top 10 books on the Madison Public Library 's list of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century , while Edith Wharton , Amy Tan , Ayn Rand , Willa Cather , Ursula Leguin , Virginia Woolf and Doris Lessing ( to name a few ) help fill out the next 90 .

A 20 - year - old Denver man was arrested Saturday after leaving a toddler in a locked car while he watched dancers at Shotgun Willie ’s strip club .
According to a police incident report , a Glendale officer was flagged down at 6:46 pm on May 10 by a Fascinations adult superstore manager who was concerned about a 3 - year - old girl left unattended in a car in the store ’s lot at 4111 East Virginia Avenue .
“ The child appeared very afraid , and seemed to ‘ cower ’ in the rear seat , ” says the report .
“ There was no food or water left in the vehicle . ”
The officer estimated the temperature outside was about fifty degrees and that the front driver ’s side window of the vehicle was open about three inches .
The manager said he had seen a black male in a striped shirt exit the vehicle and enter the adjacent strip club approximately 25 minutes earlier .
When officers entered the establishment , they identified Alan Baxter as the man fitting the description .
Baxter had a bottle of beer and was handing money to a topless dancer .
Baxter was initially evasive in his responses to police questions , but eventually admitted that the child was his girlfriend ’s daughter .
Police phoned Daphne Phillips , who said that she had given her boyfriend twenty dollars to take the little girl out for dinner at McDonalds while she was at work .
“ Baxter admitted the $ 16 dollars he had in one dollar bills was from the $ 20 Daphne had given to him to feed the child and himself , ” the officer wrote .
“ Reportedly three dollars out of the $ 20 was used to pay the bar cover charge , and the ones were to tip the dancers . ”
After purchasing food for the child who “ stated she was very hungry , ” officers booked Baxter on one charge of child neglect at the Glendale Police Station , where the girl was later reunited with her mother .
The report adds that Baxter “ stated leaving the child alone was ‘ very stupid . ’ ” – Jared Jacang Maher

You may recall Bridgeport Music as a company that claims to own the rights to various musical compositions and has a long history of suing anyone who samples even the tiniest bits of that music .
The worst part is that there are very serious questions concerning whether or not it really has the rights to much of the music it claims to control .
George Clinton , for example , claims that Bridgeport used forged signatures to get control over his catalog .
A recent Bridgeport case may be interesting for a different reason , though -- one that shows how the record labels have no problem contradicting themselves when on the receiving end of a copyright infringement lawsuit .
The lawsuit involved Univeral Music , who lost the original decision and was hit with a rather large fine .
Universal Music appealed that decision on a variety of points -- and appears to have convinced the judge that the punitive damages tacked onto the copyright infringement claims were unconstitutional .
This is quite interesting because , as Ray Beckerman notes in that link , Universal Music is involved in a bunch of lawsuits where it 's pushing for extremely high fines for individuals found guilty of infringement .
In fact , Universal Music is actually on the receiving end of a lawsuit that accuses the company of requesting unconstitutionally high fines .
In that case , Universal Music is asking for fines that are more than 1,000 x the actual damages .
Pretty high , right ?
So what were the damages that Universal Music ( and the court ) found so unconstitutionally high in this case from Bridgeport ?
Turns out they were about 10 x the actual damages .
Funny how that works .
It seems like Universal Music may come to regret pointing out the variety of reasons ( pdf ) why punitive damages can be seen as unconstitutional , as one would imagine that UMG's own filing will be raised against it in its own copyright infringement suits : Universal Music would likely claim in its own defense that it was complaining about , and in the other lawsuits it 's fighting for , but there are already plenty of folks pointing out that there really is n't much of a difference in many cases .

We all know that the media is perfectly capable of ignoring even the most basic precepts of economics , but I thought Chris Plummer 's article was especially heroic in doing so .
Even more so , it is absolutely stunning in its arrogance .
In his article , he writes on all the great ways that $ 8 a gallon gasoline will help make the world a better place .
I will stay away from the global warming related issues -- I have a whole other blog dedicated to that -- but here are a couple of the most egregious parts :
They may contain computer chips , but the power source
for today 's cars is little different than that which drove the first
Model T 100 years ago .
That we 're still harnessed to this antiquated
technology is testament to Big Oil 's influence in Washington and
success in squelching advances in fuel efficiency and alternative
energy .
Given our achievement
in getting a giant mainframe 's computing power into a handheld device
in just a few decades , we should be able to do likewise with these
dirty , little rolling power plants that served us well but are overdue
for the scrap heap of history .
OK , this first one is a science problem and not an engineering problem .
Here is the problem : Gasoline contains more potential energy by weight and volume than any power storage source we have been able to invent ( OK , its actually second , nuclear fuel is first , but I presume Plummer is not going there ) .
That is the problem with electric cars , for example .
Electric traction motors are demonstrably better sources of motive power than internal combustion engines .
Even Diesel railroad engines are actually driven by electric traction motors .
The problem is energy storage .
Batteries store much less energy per pound and per cubit foot than gasoline .
Ditto natural gas and hydrogen ( except at very high pressures ) .
This claim that only the political power of oil companies keeps no - brainer alternative technologies at bay is absurd , though it is one that never dies in the lunatic fringes .
Mr. Plummer is more than welcome to make himself a billion dollars by selling one of these mystery technologies he fails to disclose .
I will be first in line to buy .
Necessity being the mother of invention , $ 8 gas would trigger all
manner of investment sure to lead to groundbreaking advances .
Job
creation would n't be limited to research labs ; it would rapidly spill
over into lucrative manufacturing jobs that could help restore
America 's industrial base and make us a world leader in a critical
realm .
This is the broken window fallacy on steroids .
I am a HUGE optimist about the limitless capabilities of the human mind , probably more so than Mr. Plummer ( by the way , if he is such an optimist , he should read some Julian Simon ) .
But the best that humanity can probably do any time soon is offset a goodly percentage of the damage from $ 8 gas .
There is no net win here .
If there were , he should also be advocating $ 10 bread , $ 2,000,000 starter home prices , and $ 200 a month internet service .
Just think about all the innovation that would be required to react to these !
On a similar note , Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez and Iran 's Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad recently gained a platform on the world stage because of
their nations ' sudden oil wealth .
Without it , they would face the
difficult task of building fair and just economies and societies on
some other basis .
Yes sir .
Chavez would be much worse off if he was getting $ 8 for his gas rather than $ 3 .
What is this guy thinking ?
Well , he says this :
In the near term , breaking our dependence on Middle Eastern oil may
well require the acceptance of drilling in the Alaskan wilderness
OK , but that can be done at $ 3 gas , and should have been allowed at $ 2 gas .
This oil could have been developed in an environmentally friendly way years ago .
Only Congressional stupidity stands in the way ( probably with the past support of Mr. Plummer ) .
The recent housing boom sparked further development of
antiseptic , strip - mall communities in distant outlying areas .
Making
100 - mile - plus roundtrip commutes costlier will spur construction of
more space - efficient housing closer to city centers , including cluster
developments to accommodate the millions of baby boomers who will no
longer need their big empty - nest suburban homes .
Sure , there 's plenty of
land left to develop across our fruited plains , but building more
housing around city and town centers will enhance the sense of
community lacking in cookie - cutter developments slapped up in the

The third season of Morgan Spurlock ’s FX series 30 Days kicks off continues tonight with Spurlock dropping an opponent of gay adoption into a household headed by a same - sex couple in Michigan .
I happen to know the gay couple featured , Tom and Dennis Patrick , and their four boys .
Every summer my family attends Gay Family Week in Saugatuck ( not just me and the boyfriend and the kid , but my whole extended family ) , as do the Patricks .
Tom and Dennis are great , mellow , thoughtful guys who ’ve adopted four boys out of foster care .
The state of Michigan , which should be pinning a medal on these guys , has instead threatened to take away their health - care benefits in the wake of an anti-gay marriage amendment to Michigan ’s state constitution .
But that ’s not the point of this post …
Yesterday GLAAD the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamationsent out a mass email urging “ community members ” to contact FX Networks to protest statements made by an anti-gay activist Spurlock interviews during the show .
GLAAD , which once gave an award to 30 Days , says …
Regrettably , the episode also features a defamatory statement by Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council , an anti-gay activist organization , who claims : “ Homosexuality is associated with higher rates of sexual promiscuity , sexually transmitted diseases , mental illness , substance abuse , domestic violence , and child sexual abuse , and those are all reasons for us to be concerned about placing children into that kind of setting . ”
While there is no credible scientific research that backs Spriggs claim and much that disputes it the episode presents his assertion as if it were fact and offers no credible social science experts or child health authorities to challenge Spriggs assertion .
Indeed , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Psychological Association , the Child Welfare League of America , and many other child health and social services authorities who support parenting by qualified lesbian and gay parents dispute Spriggs claim .
GLAAD asked FX Networks last week to either edit Sprigg ’s comments out of the show or bring in one of those “ credible social science ” experts to respond to Sprigg ’s comments .
FX refused .
I just watched the episode on a preview copy that FX overnighted to me in hopes , no doubt , that I would disagree with GLAAD and defend FX and Spurlock ’s decision to air the show as -is .
Uh … sorry , FX , sorry , Morgan , but GLAAD is 100 % right .
Sprigg ’s comments come early in the program and linger like mustard gas over every scene that comes after .
A casual viewer may watch Tom and Dennis with their kids and think , “ Okay , these guys are decent parents , and maybe their boys are going to be fine … but other kids adopted by other gays might not be so lucky .
Other kids might wind up adopted by those gays that abuse kids , and rape them , and worse . ”
And GLAAD did n’t even mention the interview that comes immediately after Sprigg ’s : Right after handing the mic to Sprigg Spurlock talks to Dawn Stefanowicz , a woman that wrote a book about living with a gay parenther biological father after he came out of the closet in the 1970s .
This woman ’s father talked to her about bathhouse sex “ at the kitchen table , ” and dragged her to a “ downtown sex shop . ”
She holds her father up with Spurlock ’s help , and tinkly so - sad music playing in the background not as an example of a lousy parent , gay or straight , but as an example of why no gay people should be allowed to parent .
“ Based on your personal experience do you believe children are at risk if they re raised in homosexual households ? ”
Spurlock asks this woman .
“ Children need a married mother and father , ” she replies .
“ I know that there are so many situations that are not ideal , but we still need to hold to an ideal that is best for children . ”
And , as with the interview with Sprigg , Spurlock does n’t challenge this woman ’s assertions or bring in anyone to address them .
Instead Spurlock moves on to this :
Hey , you can make piles of money providing sperm to lesbians that want to be moms you know , those non-ideal parents that are n’t best for children !
So basically Spurlock did n’t just talk to Sprigg , and let him lie and lie and lie some more , he brought in someone to second Sprigg someone using right - wing religious code and allows her to assert that it would be better for Tom and Dennis ’s kids if they had n’t been adopted at all .
And , again , the casual viewer is left to conclude that it would probably be for the best if Tom and Dennis had n’t been able to adopt those boys because , hey , God only knows what Tom and Dennis are talking about at the kitchen table when there are n’t any cameras ( or clueless Mormon bigots ) in the house .
GLAAD wants you to contact the folks listed below to complain about Sprigg and Spurlock and 30 Daysand so do I .
I started watching these charts a couple months ago and , after the latest round got released , decided I ’d post them here as a “ canary in the coal - mine ” alert .
These charts tell me that the folks at the Fed are in uncharted territory .
Their own charts tell the tale …
This first one , “ non - borrowed reserves of depository institutions ” shows a quite startling plunge over the last three months .
If I were running the family checkbook and looking at this chart I ’d be saying “ Marcie , I think we ’re broke . ”
Here ’s where I started ;
and here ’s the latest version ;
Click HERE if you want to look at the current version of this chart .
I sure hope it looks better when you visit their page .
Here ’s another one — pretty much the converse of the first picture , but this series goes a lot further back .
Yep , another huge swing .
The thing that I like about this series is that it goes way back in time — to long before the great banking crash of 1930 / 31 .
and here ’s the latest version ;
A couple months ago , you could see all kinds of wiggles in the chart .
Now it ’s just a flat line with a giant upsurge at the end .

Here ’s another view .
This is the change in the size of the money supply , compared to last year .
As you can see , the Fed is pushing this up pretty hard right now .
Click HERE for the page that I used to generate this chart — unfortunately , I ca n’t automate the “ current version ” display .
I ’m interested in these charts because this represents a huge “ tinkering ” effort by the Fed .
I hate those .
I worry about unintended consequences ( maybe a lot of inflation ? ) .
I worry that the banks are masking a huge weakness paving the problem over with money borrowed from the Fed .

Once you ’ve clicked on a series that you ’re interested in , look for a link that says “ current series in FRED ” to see the charts like these .
For the first time in my life , I ’m buying gold .

They ’re a great gang , I love their systems , I appreciate being able to actually own the metal and I think the opportunity to choose between vaults in 3 countries rocks .
I never ever thought I ’d get to this ridiculous place .
But this is nuts , people .
I ’ll keep adding on to this post as events unfold .

A comprehensive transatlantic pact clearing the way for the unprecedented supply of private data on European citizens to the American authorities is to be promoted by France in support of the US - driven campaign to combat terrorism and transnational crime .
The French government is expected to use its six - month presidency of the EU , starting tomorrow , to build on 18 months of confidential negotiations between Washington and Brussels aimed at clearing the complex legal obstacles to the exchange of personal information with the Americans .
The controversial proposed pact , a " framework agreement " on common data protection principles , is likely to enable the Americans to access the credit card histories , banking details and travel habits of Europeans , although senior officials in Brussels deny US reports that the Americans will also be able to snoop on the internet browsing records of Europeans .
" Everybody 's keen on this and sees the benefit of it .
The French are very keen to continue the work , " said a senior official in Brussels .
" There 's all sorts of information stored on computers nowadays that may be of interest to law enforcement agencies .
If we reach agreement , we may well contemplate turning it into a binding international agreement . "
The Americans want to seal the accord this year , while George Bush is still in the White House .
But the European commission , running the negotiations along with EU member states , believes a quick deal is unlikely and that its conclusion will hinge on the energy with which the incoming US administration tackles the subject .
The negotiations , being conducted by a " high - level contact group " of European and US department of homeland security officials , have been led for the past 18 months by Stewart Baker on the US side and Jonathan Faull , a Briton responsible for justice and home affairs in the commission .
The US drive to gain access to the private data of Europeans is the latest episode in a systematic American campaign .
Under separate agreements being negotiated , Washington is insisting on having armed guards on flights from Europe to the US , is introducing a new electronic travel authorisation system where travellers to the US would need to apply online for permission to fly before buying a ticket , and last year the EU yielded to American pressure to supply the US authorities with 19 pieces of information on passengers flying from Europe to America .
Washington is using its visa - waiver system , making travel to the US visa - free for most European countries , to force EU states to comply with its demands .
" This is outrageous , " said Sophie I n't Veld , a Dutch Liberal MEP on the European parliament 's civil liberties committee .
" This is about fundamental rights .
But it has all been done in secret by civil servants behind closed doors . "
The two sides are said to have reached agreement on about a dozen areas , but a big sticking point remains legal redress for Europeans who feel they are being victimised by US possession of information that may be incorrect or used incorrectly .

I 've fixed all the basic usability issues and added some ' preloaded examples ' to illustrate how it might be used in tutorials / documentation .
All the code is already available in the Google Code repository , but I need to write some brief docs .
There is only around 200 lines of Python , 75 lines of Javascript and 25 lines of C# in the whole project - so customising it should be very easy .
Chapter 14 : Extending IronPython with C#Â / VB.NET
I 've just finished chapter 14 of IronPython in Action - well , finished a version I can send to my editor anyway .
I had more fun writing this chapter than I expected .
It 's called " Extending IronPython with C# / VB.NET " , and is all about writing class libraries in C# or VB.NET and using them from IronPython .
This might be for performance reasons , for accessing features of the .NET framework like attributes or Linq that are hard to use from IronPython , or for simply making your class libraries as nice to use from IronPython as possible .
The table of contents for the chapter ( pre-edit ! ) is :
14.1 . Writing a Class Library for IronPython
14.1.1 . Working with Visual Studio or MonoDevelop 14.1.2 . Python Objects from Class Libraries 14.1.3 .
Calling Unmanaged Code with the P / Invoke Attribute 14.1.4 .
Methods with Attributes through Subclassing
14.2 . Creating Dynamic ( and Pythonic ) Objects from C# / VB.NET
14.2.1 . Creating Dynamic Objects 14.2.2 . APIs with Keyword and Multiple Arguments
14.3 . Compiling and Using Assemblies at Runtime
14.4 . Summary
This is one of the nice things about IronPython , dropping down into C# to extend it is worlds easier than writing C extensions for CPython .
There is no C API to have to worry about , and most of the normal C# you write will ' just work ' when used from IronPython .
The chapter has five class libraries , each written in both C# and VB .
NET .
Inevitably in the process I learned more about both these languages .
VB.NET is not so bad , although more verbose than C# ( semantically they 're very similar of course ) .
My favourite comparison is defining a method that provides iteration .
In Python this is def __iter__ ( self ) : . In VB.NET it is Public Function GetEnumerator ( )
As IEnumerator Implements IEnumerable .
GetEnumerator .
Although I love the dynamic goodness of Python , the C# syntax for properties and indexers is nicer than the Python syntax .
Next onto chapter 15 , which is the final chapter .
I 've been looking forward to writing this chapter for a long time : it is on embedding IronPython in .NET applications and interacting with DLR objects from C# ( and VB.NET ) .
Python in the Browser : Live Interactive Interpreter in an HTML Textarea
A while ago I experimented with an interactive Python interpreter that ran in the browser using Silverlight .
Unfortunately a couple of bugs with the version of IronPython for Silverlight prevented it from working properly .
Now that Silverlight 2 Beta 2 is out , along with an updated version of IronPython for Silverlight , those bugs have been fixed .
" Python in the Browser " is an interactive Python interpreter that runs in the browser , using Silverlight 2 and IronPython .
This is ideal for tutorials and documentation , where example Python code can actually be tried in the browser .
You can see a live demo of the current version at :
It requires Silverlight 2 Beta 2 , and the Python version is 2.5 .
Builtin modules are available , but I have n't made much of the standard library available in the demo ( they simply need to be added to the ' xap ' file containing the silverlight application . )
Although the version in the repository works , it has some known limitations .
See the issues page for the known ones so far .
The interpreter runs in an HTML textarea , with Javascript that communicates with Silverlight and prevents you deleting text from the console except after the interactive prompt .
Target browsers are Firefox 2 & 3 , Safari and IE 7 & 8 .
( It wo n't work in other browsers until there is a version of Silverlight that works with them . )
Silverlight 2 is currently only available for Windows and Mac OS X , with the Firefox , Safari or IE browsers .
Linux support is in the works via the Moonlight project from Mono .
The project is a combination of IronPython ( for the interpreter loop ) , Javascript ( for the ' console behaviour ' in the textarea ) and C# ( as a helper to call into Silverlight from Javascript ) .
On every keypress Javascript calls into IronPython ( via the C# ! ) .
If the keypress is an ' enter ' , then it pushes the current line into the interpreter loop ( which uses the standard library code module ) .
Stdout is diverted to print into the textarea , where tracebacks are also sent .
If you are attempting to type over , or delete , previous output then the keypress is cancelled .

The Dark History of John McCain's Senior Adviser ...
Jon Ponder Byon 6/27/2008 , 6:11 am PT
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
Charlie Black , John McCain 's senior adviser , made news earlier this week when Fortune Magazine editor David Whitford reported that Black told him " with startling candor " when asked how a terrorist attack inside the United States would affect the campaign , " Certainly it would be a big advantage to [ McCain ] . "
Keith Olbermann has been reporting on this story all week on his MSNBC news hour , in part to make that point that if a Democrat had made a similar gaffe , the Beltway punditocracy would have been in high dudgeon , demanding the adviser 's head on a pike and lambasting the candidate for associating himself with such scum .
Longtime political junkies know that Charlie Black was among a handful of angry young rightwingers who remade the Republican Party after the debacle of Richard Nixon 's resignation .
Along with Roger Stone , Terry Dolan , Lee Atwater , Karl Rove and George Bush Jr. , he is one of the inventors of today 's GOP attack machine , a style of media - driven slash and burn politics that can be traced to the establishment by Black , Stone and Dolan in 1975 of a political action committee that raised millions from conservatives using deceptive direct - mail advertising and spent the money on TV ads that slimed Democrats .
Black , one of the most successful lobbyists and political strategists of the Reagan and Bush eras , has backed his share of losers over the years , too .
But even when he has bet on the wrong horse , he has always landed on his feet --- which may explain why John McCain needs Charlie Black this year much more than Black needs McCain .
Here are 10 things to know about Charlie Black :
1. He 's a Tarheel : Charles R. Black Jr. was born on Oct. 11 , 1947 , in the North Carolina seaport city of Wilmington .
2. A Goldwater Boy :
He told the New York Times that he fell in love in politics when he worked on the presidential campaign of Republican Barry Goldwater as a high school student in 1964 .
Goldwater lost to Pres. Lyndon Johnson in a rout .
3. A Jesse Helms Man :
In 1972 , at age 25 , Black served as political director for the first senatorial campaign of Jesse Helms , the North Carolina crypto-racist and uber - homophobe .
In 1996 , he told the New York Times , at the beginning of the race " everybody knew he was too conservative , he'd never run for office , and could n't win .
But it was a good conservative cause , so I went down and worked on his campaign for the last six months .
And lo and behold , we did win . "
4. Smear Group Founder : In 1975 , with Terry Dolan and Roger Stone , Charlie Black was a founder of the National Conservative Political Action Committee ( NCPAC ) , which used deceptively written direct mail solicitations to bankroll television ads smearing Democrats in congressional campaigns in the Reagan era .
Roger Stone has to be one of the sleaziest Republican operatives of all time .
Earlier this year , he warned Florida Gov. Charlie Crist that in order to be considered as John McCain 's vice president , Crist , a 49 - year - old longtime bachelor , would have to get married --- incorrectly stating that " bachelors do n't get elected vice president .
In fact , Franklin Pierce 's vice president , William Rufus de Vane King , was a confiirmed bachelor .
Known as " Aunt Fancy , " King was one of the first two senators from Alabama , who shared digs in Washington for 25 years with fellow bachelor James Buchanan , Pierce 's successor in the presidency .
Earlier this year , Stone launched an anti-Hillary Clinton organization he called Citizens United Not Timid , which he promoted online by using its acronym .
In 1996 , he had to resign from a volunteer position on the Dole presidential campaign after an ad in a swingers ' magazine surfaced that featured a photo of Stone and his wife .
Black and Stone moved on from NCPAC soon after it was established , parting ways with Terry Dolan .
In 1979 and 1980 , NCPAC spent over the then - unheard of figure of $ 7 million on spurious TV ads against Democrats .
Dolan once called NCPAC a '' gut - cutting organization . "
The macho rhetoric is notable because Dolan , along with the McCarthyite Roy Cohn and Sen. " Tailgunner " Joe McCarthy himself , was a classic self - hating gay Republican homophobe .
While he worked tirelessly to slime liberals and their causes by day , at night Dolan was rumored to frequent leather bars where he picked up rough trade .
He died from HIV disease in 1986 at the age of 36 .
( Additional source : New York Times , May 31 , 1981 )
5. Fired By Reagan :
In 1980 , Charlie Black worked as field director for Ronald Reagan 's second presidential campaign .
After advising Reagan to ignore the Iowa caucuses --- advice that almost cost Reagan the nomination --- he was among the senior staff Reagan fired after he lost the New Hampshire primary .
6. Formed Mega - Lobbying Group : Soon after being fired by Reagan , Black and Stone , with Paul Manafort , formed Black , Manafort and Stone , a political consulting firm .
The firm 's lobbying clients have included Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp.
Ltd. and the investment firm of Salomon Brothers , as well as foreign politicians , including Mohamed Siad Barre of Somalia , Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines , Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire , and Jonas Savimbi of Angola .
More recently , Black was an early supporter of Ahmed Chalabi , the Iraqi conman who helped Dick Cheney and his cabal of neocons float false intelligence that laid the groundwork for Bush - Cheney 's disastrous invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Black 's firm helped open doors for Chalabi 's front group , the Iraqi National Congress ( INC ) , with U.S. corporations , including AT&T , Cummins Engine , and Fluor .
In 2003 , Black said , " Due to our past representation of the INC , we know and have worked with a lot of people who will be in the provisional government .
We have a number of clients who are interested in doing business in Iraq . "
Black adds that his firm is " strongly considering " opening an office in Baghdad .
It is unclear whether Black 's firm ever opened a branch office in Iraq .
7. Lee Atwater : In 1985 , Lee Atwater , the man who taught Karl Rove and George Bush Jr. everything they know about political hatchet work and the dark art of manipulating the masses , joined Black 's lobbying firm within months after serving as deputy campaign manager in the 1984 Reagan - Bush campaign .
Black and Atwater went way back .
In 1973 , Atwater managed the campaign of Karl Rove to become president of the College Republicans , defeating his opponent , Terry Dolan , whose campaign had been managed by Charlie Black , Roger Stone , and Paul Manafort .
In March 1990 , Lee Atwater was serving as chairman of the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor ( which many people believed developed because of his constant use of a then new - tech cordless telephone ) .
Atwater named Charlie Black as his " mouthpiece " at the RNC while he dealt with his illness .
As the disease progressed , Atwater came to see the error of his ways and made rounds of phone calls seeking forgiveness from Democrats and others whose reputations and careers he had destroyed .
There has never been any evidence that Black , Rove , Bush Jr. , and the others learned anything from Atwater 's end - of - life come - to - Jesus .
8. Ailes on Black : About Black , Roger Ailes , then ( as now ) a Republican media consultant ( only now he masks his party operative role behind the legit - sounding title of president of Fox News ) , said '' Charlie 's the kind of guy who if he came home and found somebody making out with his wife on a rainy day , he 'd break the guy 's umbrella and ask him to leave , then have him killed a year later .
[ Lee Atwater ] would blow the house up . ''
( New York Times , July 21 , 1990 )
9. Homophobic Remarks :
In March 1993 , when the gays in the military issue was in the headlines , Charlie Black and Iran - Contra scandal figure Oliver North made headlines when they chimed in with homophobic remarks at a banquet in Northern Virginia for retired Republican Rep. Rep. Stan Parris .
According to the New York Times ( March 19 , 1993 ) , before Black and North spoke , Virginia state Senator Warren E. Barry began his keynote comments by referring to " ' the Clinton fags - in - the - foxhole ' policy and then joked about how Mr. Parris , when he was in Congress , seemed to be constantly at odds with the officials of the District of Columbia , who are mostly black .
He recalled that Mr. Parris had once called a bridge leading from Washington to Virginia ' the longest bridge in the world because it connects Virginia to Africa . '
He went on , with a laugh , to say Mr. Parris sought to rename the bridge ' Soul Brothers Causeway . ' "
When it was Black 's turn , he joked that Clinton was going to change the words of the Marine Corps hymn to " Don we now our gay apparel . " ( ROTFL . )
When it was time for Ollie North 's comedic turn , the Times reported that he " included a line about how he had repeatedly tried to place a telephone call to Mr. Clinton but could not get through until he lisped to the operator , ' Excuse me ! ' "
10 . Friends Like
These :
In a New York Times profile of Black in February 1996 , one anonymous " friend " said of Charlie , " He 's very folksy , but he 's tough .
Charlie will pat you on the back one moment , stab you in the back the next . "
John Buckley , an admirer , said , " Charlie would never stab you in the back .
You would be gutted from the front .
You just would n't know it until you 're dead . "
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy gives a thumbs - up as he leaves Massachusetts General Hospital on Wednesday , May 21 2008 .
Seems everyone these days is giving the thumbs - up , no matter the circumstances .
Senator Edward Kennedy gave a big thumbs - up as he left the hospital Wednesday , facing a new outlook on life with a potentially deadly brain tumor .
Hillary did it just this week at a we 're - not - mathematically - defeated - yet campaign rally in Florida .
John McCain can't not do it .
The gesture , for better or worse , has long breathed life or death into major events .
Death to gladiators
The thumbs - up gesture has its roots in ancient Rome , where gladiators would literally live or die by it .
Pollice verso is the Latin term for the gesture , meaning " with a turned thumb . "
" It was a hand gesture that was used by the crowd to say if the gladiator should live or die after a fight , " explains Lisa Slattery Rashotte , a sociologist at the University of North Carolina , Charlotte .
The last thing a sweaty sportsman wanted was a thumbs - up .
While in modern times it has a positive meaning , back then it meant " get him out of here , " or death , while a concealed thumb ( considered thumbs - down ) meant the gladiator lived .
War ready
During World War II , American pilots gave the thumbs - up a new spin .
" The most well - documented origin of it in the U.S. is from World War II , " Rashotte told LiveScience .
" Pilots would use a thumbs - up to indicate they were ready to go up .
That 's how they would indicate to the crew that they were ready , that everything was good . "
The hand motion spread across Europe and even parts of South America during the war .
While many cheerful gestures have fallen out of popularity , such as the increasingly tired high - five and its really dated predecessor , gimme - five , the thumbs - up has kept a firm grip on cultures .
The media is one reason for the gesture 's sticking power .
" With the thumbs - up and the pilots , you saw that image a lot .
It was a positive image from a war situation that could be brought back home and put in the papers , " Rashotte said .
The thumbs - up took a small hit in the 1950s and 1960s as anti-war sentiments took center stage and the peace sign became the more popular positive gesture .
The Fonz !
Rashotte said the sitcom " Happy Days , " which first aired in 1974 , likely revived the thumbs - up .
The show 's too - cool character Fonzie ( Arthur Fonzarelli , played by Henry Winkler ) , often flipped both thumbs - up while flashing a dashing grin and delivering a gravelly " aaaaaaaay . "
With its widespread usage in the United States , the " everything is good " sign might be here to stay .
" People in the U.S. know that thumbs - up means ' good job ' or ' I agree ' or ' things are good . '
In our culture , it seems to be one of the more fundamental kinds of nonverbal communications , " Rashotte said .
In other regions , the thumbs - up sign is also popular , though it can have various meanings .
In Iran and Greece , it can be the equivalent of " flipping someone off , " Rashotte said .
In India , the meaning changes depending on whether the gesture is accompanied by certain words or other hand movements , she added .
Editor 's Note : Several readers questioned whether thumbs - up really meant death to Roman gladiators .
While there is debate , Rashotte said in a follow - up telephone interview that scientists generally agree thumbs - up signaled death .
As for the movie " Gladiators , " the conventional usage of thumbs - up was portrayed , likely because that 's what modern - day moviegoers would understand since the gesture was n't explained in the movie , she suggested .
" There is some debate about it , but I think it 's pretty well - accepted among academic communities that thumb - up [ means ] put to death , " Rashotte said .

The technology industry has an increasingly complex relationship to government and politics , most importantly in three areas :
Privacy and surveillance .
Censorship .
Antitrust , general economic regulation , and other competition management .
Here ’s some of what I think about that , plus links to a lot more .
1 . For a long time , I ’ve maintained :
Privacy and surveillance are very big deals .
Ultimately , they cannot be handled effectively without direct regulation of specific permitted and forbidden uses of data .
The first point is now widely accepted .
The second unfortunately is not ; laws and regulations generally state who may or may not record , keep or decrypt particular kinds of data , rather than what particular uses they may make of it .
2 . Another threat to freedom has arisen as big as that from privacy / surveillance : a many - fronts push for censorship .
It would ultimately be calamitous for free countries to agree that the threat of “ Fake News ” and other dangerous online partisanship justifies general censorship , by governments or “ platform ” tech companies as the case may be , yet that is exactly the path we seem to be on .
Fortunately , there are less dangerous ways to address the same challenges .
I expect to make as much fuss about this issue in the upcoming decade as I have about privacy / surveillance over the past one .

Most observers hold several or all of the views :
“ Fake news ” and the like are severe problems .
Algorithmic solutions have not worked well to date .
Neither have manual ones .
Trusting governments to censor is a bad idea .
In light of the previous points , trusting large social media corporations to censor is a bad idea too .
Educating consumers to evaluate news and opinions accurately would be … difficult .
And further :
Whatever you think of the job traditional journalistic organizations previously did as news arbiters , they ca n’t do it as well anymore , for a variety of economic , structural and societal reasons .
But despite all those difficulties , I also believe that a good solution to news / opinion filtering is feasible ; it just ca n’t be as simple as everybody would like .

The United States has new legal limits on electronic surveillance , both in one specific way and — more important — in prevailing judicial theory .
This falls far short of the protections we ultimately need , but it ’s a welcome development even so .
The recent Supreme Court case Carpenter v. United States is a big deal .
Let me start by saying :
Most fundamentally , the Carpenter decision was based on and implicitly reaffirms the Katz test . *
This is good .
This is good .
The Carpenter decision undermines the third - party doctrine .**
This is great .
Strict adherence to the third - party doctrine would eventually have given the government unlimited rights of Orwellian surveillance .
This is great .
Strict adherence to the third - party doctrine would eventually have given the government unlimited rights of Orwellian surveillance .
The Carpenter decision suggests the Court has adopted an equilibrium - adjustment approach to Fourth Amendment jurisprudence .
The “ equilibrium ” being maintained here is the balance between governmental rights to intrude on privacy and citizens ’ rights not to be intruded on .
e. , equilibrium - adjustment is a commitment to maintaining approximately the same level of liberty ( with respect to surveillance ) we ’ve had all along .
I got the equilibrium - adjustment point from Eugene Volokh ’s excellent overview of the Carpenter decision .
* The Katz test basically says that that an individual ’s right to privacy is whatever society regards as a reasonable expectation of privacy at that time .
** The third - party doctrine basically says that any information of yours given voluntarily to a third party is n’t private .
This includes transactional information such as purchases or telephone call detail records ( CDRs )

In my initial post on brittleness I suggested that a typical process is :
Build something brittle .
Strengthen it over time .
In many engineering scenarios , a fuller description could be :
Design something that works in the base cases .
Anticipate edge cases and sources of error , and design for them too .
Implement the design .
Discover which edge cases and error sources you failed to consider .
Improve your product to handle them too .
Repeat as needed .
So it ’s necesseary to understand what is or is n’t likely to go wrong .
Unfortunately , that need is n’t always met .

Every system — computer or otherwise — needs to deal with possibilities of damage or error .
If it does this well , it may be regarded as “ robust ” , “ mature (d ) , “ strengthened ” , or simply “ improved ” . *
Otherwise , it can reasonably be called “ brittle ” .
* It ’s also common to use the word “ harden ( ed ) ” .
But I think that ’s a poor choice , as brittle things are often also hard .
0 . As a general rule in IT :
New technologies and products are brittle .
They are strengthened incrementally over time .
There are many categories of IT strengthening .
Two of the broadest are :
1 . One of my more popular posts stated :
Developing a good DBMS requires 5 - 7 years and tens of millions of dollars .
The reasons I gave all spoke to brittleness / strengthening , most obviously in :
Those minor edge cases in which your Version 1 product works poorly are n’t minor after all .
Similar things are true for other kinds of “ platform software ” or distributed systems .
2 . The UI brittleness / improvement story starts similarly : Read more

The tech industry has a broad range of political concerns .
While I may complain that things have been a bit predictable in other respects , politics is having real and new ( ish ) technical consequences .
In some cases , existing technology is clearly adequate to meet regulators ’ and customers ’ demands .
Other needs look more like open research challenges .
1. Privacy regulations will be very different in different countries or regions .
For starters :
This is one case in which the European Union ’s bureaucracy is working pretty well .
It ’s making rules for the whole region , and they are n’t totally crazy ones .
Things are more chaotic in the English - speaking democracies .
Authoritarian regimes are enacting anti-privacy rules .
All of these rules are subject to change based on :
Genuine technological change .
Changes in politicians ’ or the public ’s perceptions .
And so I believe : For any multinational organization that handles customer data , privacy / security requirements are likely to change constantly .
Technology decisions need to reflect that reality .
2. Data sovereignty / geo-compliance is a big deal .
In fact , this is one area where the EU and authoritarian countries such as Russia formally agree .
Each wants its citizens ’ data to be stored locally , so as to ensure adherence to local privacy rules .
For raw , granular data , that ’s a straightforward — even if annoying — requirement to meet .
But things get murkier for data that is aggregated or otherwise derived .

I have a LOT of partially - written blog posts , but am struggling to get any of them finished ( obviously ) .
Much of the problem is that they have so many dependencies on each other .
Clearly , then , I should consider refactoring my writing plans . 🙂
So let ’s start with this .
Here , in no particular order , is a list of some things that I ’ve said in the past , and which I still think are or should be of interest today .
It ’s meant to be background for numerous posts I write in the near future , and indeed a few hooks for such posts are included below .
1. Data( base ) management technology is progressing pretty much as I expected .
Vendors generally recognize that maturing a data store is an important , many - years - long process .
Multiple kinds of data model are viable …
… but it ’s usually helpful to be able to do some kind of JOIN .
To deal with the variety of hardware / network / storage arrangements out there , layering / tiering is on the rise .
( An amazing number of vendors each seem to think they invented the idea . )
2. Rightly or wrongly , enterprises are often quite sloppy about analytic accuracy .
My two central examples have long been inaccurate metrics and false - positive alerts .
In predictive analytics , it ’s straightforward to quantify how much additional value you ’re leaving on the table with your imperfect accuracy .
Enterprise search and other text technologies are still often terrible .
After years of “ real - time ” overhype , organizations have seemingly swung to under - valuing real - time analytics .

When one tries to think comprehensively about politics these days , it quickly gets overwhelming .
But I think I ’ve got some pieces of the puzzle figured out .
Here they are in extremely summarized form .
I ’ll flesh them out later as seems to make sense .
1 . Most of what people are saying about modern tribalism is correct .
But partisanship is not as absolute as some fear .
In particular :
There are populist concerns on the right and left alike .
Partisans of all sides can be concerned about privacy , surveillance and government overreach .
2 . The threat from Trump and his Republican enablers is indeed as bad as people fear .
He ’s a major danger to do terrible , irreversible harm to the US and the rest of the world .
To date the irreversible damage has n’t been all that terrible , but if Trump and his enablers are given enough time , the oldest modern democracy will be no more .
All common interests notwithstanding , beating Trump ’s supporters at the polls is of paramount importance .
3 . I agree with those who claim that many of our problems stem from the shredding of trust .
But few people seem to realize just how many different aspects of “ trust ” there are , nor how many degrees there can be of trustworthiness .
It ’s not just a binary choice between “ honest servant of the people ” and “ lying , cheating crook ” .
These observations have strong analogies in IT .
What does it mean for a system to be “ reliable ” or to produce “ accurate ” results ?
There are many possible answers , each reasonable in different contexts .

Almost nobody pays attention to the real issues in privacy and surveillance .
That ’s gotten only slightly better over the decade that I ’ve written about the subject .
But the problems with privacy / surveillance politics run yet deeper than that .
Worldwide
The politics of privacy and surveillance are confused , in many countries around the world .
This is hardly surprising .
After all :
Privacy involves complex technological issues .
Few governments understand those well .
Privacy also involves complex business issues .
Few governments understand those well either .
Citizen understanding of these issues is no better .
Technical cluelessness is n’t the only problem .
Privacy issues are commonly framed in terms of civil liberties , national security , law enforcement and / or general national sovereignty .
And these categories are inherently confusing , in that :
Opinions about them often cross standard partisan lines .
Different countries take very different approaches , especially in the “ civil liberties ” area .
These categories are rife with questionably - founded fears , such as supposed threats from terrorism , child pornographers , or “ foreign interference ” .
Data sovereignty regulations — which are quite a big part of privacy law — get their own extra bit of confusion , because of the various purposes they can serve .
Chief among these are : Read more

スーパーマリオブラザーズの「 次の面」を求める 〜 Rangeとsuccメソッドの甘い（？）関係〜 - http://rubikitch.com/に移転しました と似たようなことを Squeak Smalltalk の UniClass と Trait でマネしてみる実験 。
Ruby の 「 特異メソッド」こと “ インスタンス特異的なメソッド”は、そのインスタンス特異的な無名で通常は不可視なクラスである「特異クラス」を作り、それにメソッドを定義することで実現されています。
Squeak Smalltalk では、#assureUniClass というメソッドがあって、これをオブジェクトにコールさせることで、そのオブジェクト特異的なクラス（ユニーククラス。UniClass）を作ることができます。このクラスに適宜メソッドを追加することで
Ruby の特異メソッドと同じようなことが可能です。
また 、Ruby の「モジュール」ことミックスイン機構は、“モジュール”と呼ばれるある種の抽象クラスをメソッドホルダに見立て、それを include することにより、そのクラスの継承パスに仮想的に差し込むことで、モジュール中に定義されたメソッドを複数のクラスから共有することを可能にしています。なお、オブジェクトをモジュールで
extend するのは、そのオブジェクトの特異クラスに同じモジュールを include するのと同じです 。
これに対して 、Squeak Smalltalk には（抽象）クラスとは別 に “ トレイト ” と呼ばれるメソッドホルダがあり、これをクラスから use することで、トレイトで定義されたメソッドを複数のクラスから共有できます。Ruby のモジュールとの大きな違いは、ターゲットクラスのメソッドの拡張に継承機構を必要としない（継承パスを
“ 汚染 ” しない）ことと、メタクラス （Ruby でいうところのクラスの特異クラス）も同時に拡張できる点です。
さて、くだんの 「 マリオのレベル」では、'1-1 ' タイプな文字列に対し、#succ をうまく機能させることができるよう
MarioLevelSucc モジュールで extend しています 。Squeak Smalltalk でも、似たようなメソッドのオーバーライドをする MarioLevel なるトレイトを定義し 、 ' 1 - 1 ' タイプな文字列特異的に作ったクラスに use させればよいはずです 。
ただ残念ながら Smalltalk には Ruby の # succ に相当する概念がありません。そこで、#+ および #- を定義する必要があります。ここでは簡単のため、「+
an Integer 」 と「- aLevel」というメッセージに応答し、それぞれ、「足した数に見合った新しいレベル」と「各レベルの差の数」を返すことを想定することにしました。
Trait named : # MarioLevel uses : {}
MarioLevel >> + anInteger ^ self class newFrom : self value + anInteger
MarioLevel >> - other ^ self value - other value
MarioLevel >> value ^{ self last digitValue .
self first digitValue} - 1 polynomialEval : 4
MarioLevel classTrait >> newFrom : anInteger ^( ' { 1}-{2} ' format : {anInteger // 4 . an Integer \\ 4 } + 1 ) asLevel
このように定義した MarioLevel を ' 1 - 1 ' なる文字列の特異的なクラスに use させる（この場合には #addToComposition : を MarioLevel を引数として添えてコールする）ことで、正しい「次の面」を生成することが可能になります。（追記：あー、おもいっきり嘘つきました(^_^;) 。上の # newFrom : でもう asLevel しちゃっているので、あとで出てく る
String >>#asLevel はすでにこの時点で定義しておかないといけません。ごめんなさい。）
| level | level := ' 1 - 1 ' . level assureUniClass class addToComposition : MarioLevel . ^level + 4
もちろん、いちいち「 assureUniClass class addToComposition : MarioLevel」するのは面倒なので 、String >>#asLevel を定義してこれをコールさせましょう。あと、MarioLevel を use したクラスのインスタンスではたんに self を返すよう 、MarioLevel >>#asLevel も同時にオーバーライドしておきます。
String >>
asLevel self assureUniClass class addToComposition : MarioLevel .
^ self
MarioLevel >>
asLevel ^ self
| level | level := ' 2 - 2 ' asLevel . ^level + 4
Smalltalk にも Ruby の Range にあたる 、Interval があります。コンストラクタは Interval class >># from : to : ですが、通常は、 「 始点 to : 終点」という式で生成するので # to : を MarioLevel にも定義しておきます。
MarioLevel >> to : other ^ Interval from : self to : other
ふう。#succ と # level の定義だけで済 む Ruby よりかなり見劣りがしてしまいますが、とりあえずこれで当初の目標は達成です。
( ' 1 - 1 ' asLevel to : ' 3 - 4 ' as Level ) asArray
= > # ( ' 1 - 1 ' ' 1 - 2 ' ' 1 - 3 ' ' 1 - 4 ' ' 2 - 1 ' ' 2 - 2 ' ' 2 - 3 ' ' 2 - 4 ' ' 3 - 1 ' ' 3 - 2 ' ' 3 - 3 ' ' 3 - 4 ' )
もちろん言うまでもなくここで書いたことは“ お遊び ” ですので、よい子は真似をしないように。ｗ そもそもこの場合、インスタンス特異的メソッドである必要がない（インスタンスはどれも同じ挙動をする）ので、Ruby はともかく Smalltalk では、きちんとそれなりのクラスを定義すべきでしょう。念のため。

The Taleban ' taxes ' poppy farmers
The Taleban made an estimated $ 100 m ( £ 50 m ) in 2007 from Afghan farmers growing poppy for the opium trade , the United Nations says .
Antonio Maria Costa , head of the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , said the money was raised by a 10 % tax on farmers in Taleban - controlled areas .
The UN estimates last year 's poppy harvest was worth $ 1bn ( £ 500 m ) .
Mr Costa said the Taleban made even more money from other activities related to the opium trade .

" One is protection to laboratories and the other is that the insurgents offer protection to cargo , moving opium across the border , " Mr Costa told the BBC's File on 4 programme .
The final figures for this year 's harvest have yet to be released but yield and proceeds are likely to be down due to drought , infestation and a poppy ban enforced in the north and east of Afghanistan .
This would lower revenue , " but not enormously " , Mr Costa said .
The past few years have seen abundant yields from poppy farming , with Afghan farmers cultivating more than the global demand .
" Last year Afghanistan produced about 8,000 tonnes of opium , " Mr Costa said .
Nato says Taleban attacks are on the rise
" The world in the past few years has consumed about 4,000 tonnes in opium , this leaves a surplus .
" It is stored somewhere and not with the farmers , " he added .
The stockpiles represent hundreds of millions of dollars and it is not known whether they are possessed by traffickers , corrupt Afghan officials and politicians or the Taleban .
British officials say that drugs money funds the Taleban 's military operations .
" The closer we look at it , the closer we see the insurgents [ are ] to the drugs trade , " said David Belgrove , head of counter narcotics at the British embassy in Kabul .
" We can say that a lot of their arms and ammunition are being funded directly by the drugs trade . "

Recently I spent some time away from RSpec and I did miss it , but one thing especially liked about the testing framework I lived in for 10 months was that it had two ways to test anything you liked :
One that hit the database and one that did not .
We used UnitRecord to disconnect unit tests from the database ( I should mention that we defined unit tests as tests that did n't hit the db and functional tests as those that did ) .
So the vast majority of our tests did n't really need to hit the db and ran very fast .
Sometimes we wanted or needed to hit the db and we did ( only occasionally in model tests , more often in controller tests , and we kept logic out of the view and only tested views at the Selenium level ) .
It was pretty cool and I 'd like to thank the team who set it up before I got there .
There 's been a lot of talk about whether model , view , or controller tests should hit the db but I 've found that there 's enough exceptions that it 's worth just saying that you should try not to hit the db when possible for speed 's sake and then when the test becomes 20 lines long because of all the mocking / stubbing required , go ahead and hit it .
That 's all well and good , but how do you disconnect the db from an RSpec example ?
I , personally , have had success with NullDB .
NullDB is the null object pattern applied to databases .
Which is a fancy way of saying that it swallows up any call that would go to the db and returns a nil .
So you mock / stub all you like , but if you forget or just do n't care about a particular call then do n't worry because nothing goes to the db and nil is returned ( which , surprisingly , is more than enough in most situations ) .
On the NullDB page I 've linked to , the author provides a way to universally disconnect RSpec from the db , but , as I 've already said , I 'm a bit pragmatic when it comes to disconnection so In my spec_helper.rb
I define something like this : and then in any " Describe " block where I 'd like to disconnect the db I do this :
If I want to hit the db I just do n't include Disconnected .
Now since NullDB fails silently I 've heard tell of problems with it being hard to debug ( although I have yet to experience these problems ) .
Any spec / test / example that just is n't behaving properly can be exiled to the ' hit the database ' area .
Also I should mention that when I tried to use NullDB with Rails 1.2.6 I got a bunch of errors but it worked fine with 2.0.2 .
If you are looking for a more vigorous enforcement of ' do n't touch the db in unit tests ' then UnitRecord may be for you .
I thought RSpec and UnitRecord did n't play nice , but my fellow Obtivian , Ryan Platte informs me that he 's got it working .
So I 'm calling him out to post about disconnecting the RSpec with UnitRecord .
I have tried to get this video to play on numerous devices and other videos on bitchute play but not this one .
It makes me wonder if we are ...

Dem upset 9/11 families excluded from trial , only Bush loyalist was invited Nick Juliano
Published : Friday June 6 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy is calling on the country 's top law enforcement official to ensure access for 9/11 victims ' family members to the military tribunal prosecuting Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others charged as masterminds of those attacks .
For Mohammed 's arraignment Thursday before a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay , the Pentagon secretly invited only one woman whose brother was a pilot killed in the plane that crashed into the Pentagon in the 2001 attacks .
The woman , Debra Burlingame , was un-invited after the New York Daily News revealed she was a " GOP loyalist , " who praised President Bush during the 2004 Republican convention and has savaged the 9/11 widows who have questioned the administration 's actions .
" I had hoped we had achieved a level of respect for victims  rights that would respect their dignity and interests , " Leahy wrote to Attorney General Michael Mukasey on Friday .
" I am writing to you to urge you to help remedy these matters without delay . "
A Leahy press release distributing the letter noted reports that an " outspoken supporter of the Bush administration " was the only invitee to Mohammed 's arraignment .
Victims ' families had reportedly been kept in the dark after asking for the opportunity to attend Mohammed 's arraignment , while the Pentagon surreptitiously proffered its single invitation .
After the uproar , a military official apologized and promised to institute a lottery for future tribunal proceedings that families wished to attend .
Leahy said the government was not acting in the spirit of legislation aimed at providing victims ' families prompt notification of legal proceedings or the opportunity to watch the proceedings either in person or via closed - circuit television .
" I write to you , our chief law enforcement officer , to ask what has been done to ensure that the 9/11 victims are being treated with respect and dignity , " Leahy wrote , " and what accommodations were made to protect their rights , given that the Government has chosen to proceed before military commissions at Guantanamo . "
With wire reports Leahy 's letter is appears below : June 6 , 2008 The Honorable Michael Mukasey Attorney General of the United States Pennsylvania Avenue , NW Washington , DC Dear Attorney General Mukasey :
This week the Government staged arraignments of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other detainees charged as perpetrators of the 9/1l attacks .
I read that the victims  families were excluded from the proceedings .
I have worked hard for many years to enact bipartisan victims  rights and assistance legislation .
I had hoped we had achieved a level of respect for victims  rights that would respect their dignity and interests .
I am writing to you to urge you to help remedy these matters without delay .
After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing , we passed several measures to provide for the rights and interests of the victims and their families , including measures to help them attend the trial , and to watch the trial on closed circuit television .
I do not understand why similar provisions were not made for the 9/11 families and victims .
We also enacted , as part of the Justice for All Act of 2004 ( Public Law 108-405 ) , federal rights for victims .
In the Scott Campbell , Stephanie Roper , Wendy Preston , Louarna Gillis , and Nila Lynn Crime Victims ' Rights
Act , we expressly provided for the right to reasonable , accurate , and timely notice of any public court proceeding ; the right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding ; the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding involving release , plea , sentencing , or parole ; the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case ; the right to full and timely restitution as provided in law ; the right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay ; and the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim 's dignity and privacy .
I write to you , our chief law enforcement officer , to ask what has been done to ensure that the 9/11 victims are being treated with respect and dignity , and what accommodations were made to protect their rights , given that the Government has chosen to proceed before military commissions at Guantanamo .
I look forward to your prompt response .
Sincerely , PATRICK LEAHY Chairman

Stephen was no stranger to New York .
He ’d been to the city as a boy , and regularly came here for work now that he was in his twenties .
A consultant , he ’d take the train from his hometown several hours south of the city , stay from Monday to Friday , then return on the weekends .
He loved New York , his mother , Judith , says .
The energy , the people , figuring out the streets and subways .
He often stayed at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square .
As a teenager , Stephen had been prone to mood swings , Judith says , and after college he was given a diagnosis of clinical depression .
He ’d cut his wrists once , badly enough to be taken to the hospital .
He ’d begun taking medication and seeing a psychiatrist , but the doctor determined that Stephen had n’t really wanted to kill himself — his cuts were n’t very deep .
He eventually told Stephen ’s parents that he was no longer a serious suicide risk .
Recently , Stephen seemed to be doing well .
He earned good money and got solid evaluations at work .
He owned a house , made investments , talked about his future .
He dated and traveled to Fiji and Sri Lanka to build homes for Habitat for Humanity .
He was still prone to bouts of depression , but “ my coping skills are so much better now , ” he told Judith .
On this rainy summer Friday , Stephen met Judith for lunch not far from where he ’d grown up .
Judith had been looking forward to their get - together , but she could see right away that Stephen was unnerved .
“ When one thing went wrong , it could mount up inside him , ” Judith says .
She tried to comfort him , and offered to take the afternoon off to help him .
But Stephen insisted he was okay , and that he had things to do .
Judith went back to work .
Stephen did not .
Instead , he went to the train station , bought a ticket to New York , and checked in to the Marriott Marquis .
At around 1 a.m. , he wrote a letter on his laptop , found a place to print it out , and placed it on the desk in his room .
Shortly before 4 a.m. , he left his room , jumped from the 45th floor into the hotel ’s soaring internal atrium , and landed in the eighth - floor lobby .
He died instantly .
Judith had left him a message earlier that night .
He never called back .
In a sense , New York City is unremarkable when it comes to suicide .
According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention , 32,637 people died by suicide in the United States in 2005 , the most recent year for which figures exist .
It ’s the third leading cause of death for Americans ages 15 to 24 , the fourth leading cause for Americans 18 to 65 .
New York State had the country ’s third - lowest per capita suicide rate in 2005 ( 6.2 per 100,000 ) ; only New Jersey ( 6.1 ) and Washington , D.C. , ( 6 ) had lower rates .
( Montana tops the list , with a rate of 22 , followed by several other western states . )
Between 1990 and 2004 , suicide rates in cities such as Miami , Las Vegas , Sacramento , and Pittsburgh dwarfed New York ’s , according to a report called “ Big Cities Health Inventory 2007 ” from the National Association of County and City Health Officials .
Of the cities included , only Boston , Baltimore , and Washington ranked lower in 2004 .
Within the city , Manhattan had a rate of 7.6 suicides per 100,000 people in 2005 , higher than the other boroughs ( Brooklyn had the fewest , at 4.64 ) , but lower than many upstate regions .
Recently , however , researchers stumbled on a striking fact about suicides in New York : A surprising number of people who kill themselves in the city come here from out of town , and many appear to come expressly to take their own lives .
In a report published last fall called “ Suicide Tourism in Manhattan , New York City , 1990 – 2004 , ” researchers at the New York Academy of Medicine and Weill Cornell Medical College found that of the 7,634 people who committed suicide in New York City between 1990 and 2004 , 407 of them , or 5.3 percent , were nonresidents .
More strikingly , nonresidents accounted for 274 , or 10.8 percent , of the 2,272 suicides in Manhattan during that time ( the numbers did not include college students , who were considered residents for the purposes of the study ) .
The researchers did n’t look at comparable data from other cities , but , says the study ’s lead author , Charles Gross , “ One in ten people that commit suicide in Manhattan do n’t live here .
That ’s a big chunk . ”
The New York City chief medical examiner ’s office wo n’t release the files it allowed the NYAM researchers to review .
But an informal survey of suicides in New York over the past twenty years reveals a bleak tapestry of out - of - towners who took their own lives .
There was John Barrachina , a civil servant from Lodi , New Jersey , who , in 1997 , woke up on the morning of his 59th birthday , drove onto the George Washington Bridge , parked his car , and jumped .
There was Shawn Gibson , from Michigan by way of Florida , who came to New York in November 2004 , at age 21 , and leaped off the Empire State Building .
That same year , Andrew Veal , 25 , drove from Georgia to New York City , then slipped inside the ground - zero reconstruction site and shot himself .
There was a man who spent his last moments filling out a job application in an office on a high floor .
There was the 51 - year - old cabbie from Poughkeepsie , a fortysomething from the Rockies , a man from Mexico City , and another from Spain .

Overall , the NYAM researchers found , nearly 80 percent of the nonresident suicides in Manhattan were committed by men .
Nearly two - thirds were committed by whites .
Almost 30 percent were committed by individuals between the ages of 25 and 34 .
Each had his own constellation of problems and motives , of course .
But in the end , they shared a common trait :
They all chose New York as the place to end their lives .
The simple and troubling question , of course , is Why ?
’ I ask myself that every day , ” Judith says when we first speak .
( Judith and Stephen are not their real names .
Judith is still deeply pained by her son ’s death and asked not to have their names or hometowns revealed . )
In most cases , multiple factors are at play , experts say .
The glamour of New York can play a role .
Just as the city ’s glittering , outsize reputation attracts many people for happy reasons , it attracts others for tragic ones .
People who are suicidal may want to die in a way that gets them attention they felt they never got when they were alive , says Herbert Hendin , a New York–based psychiatrist and the president of Suicide Prevention International .
By this logic , New York can be the perfect stage .
Anonymity can also play a part .
People who are suicidal often feel isolated and alone .
The city can reflect back or exacerbate those feelings , making it seem like a suitable setting for one ’s final act , says David Rosen , a Texas A&M psychology professor who has written extensively on depression and suicide .
Attempting to protect friends and family can lead people to New York as well .
“ Frequently , people who are considering suicide want to make sure that their death is , relatively speaking , as easy as possible on their loved ones , ” says Thomas Joiner , a psychology professor at Florida State University and the author of Why People Die by Suicide .
There ’s an idea that going somewhere far away will spare people the trauma of discovery and keep them from having to associate a local site with the person ’s death .
“ People who are doing this are trying to say to their family that it ’s not your fault , ” says Hendin .
New York has a certain grim , practical allure , as well .
The roots of suicide are vast and complex , but in the end , “ the suicidal person wants access to lethal means , ” says John Draper , project director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline .
The ideal method , Draper says , is “ what appears to the individual to be the most attractive and painless way . ”
People who live around a lot of guns , for instance , have been found to be disproportionately inclined to shoot themselves .
Hendin worked in parts of Norway where suicide by drowning was more frequent than he ’d seen elsewhere .
More recently , he ’s been overseeing work being done in rural areas of China , where people often swallow agricultural pesticides .
Through suicidal eyes , the New York skyline can appear to be “ a lot of opportunities to die from heights . ”
New York , with all of its tall buildings and bridges , makes a perversely attractive place to kill oneself .
Through suicidal eyes , the skyline can appear to be “ a lot of opportunities to die from heights , ” says Gary Spielmann , the former director of suicide prevention for the New York State Office of Mental Health .
“ A lot of windows and doors and balconies that can easily be negotiated by a jumper . ”
And jumping , says Kay Redfield Jamison , a Johns Hopkins psychiatry professor and the author of An Unquiet Mind , has the twisted appeal of being “ practical , final , and irrevocable . ”
It can also seem dramatic .
Gary Gorman , a retired policeman who was assigned to the NYPD ’s Emergency Service Unit , which responds to suicide calls , says that some people who jump from bridges or buildings may want people to look up at them , to know about them , to notice them in death in a way they had n’t been noticed in life .
According to the NYAM study , nonresidents who kill themselves in Manhattan are less likely to have done so by methods commonly used in the home , such as overdosing or hanging , and are 30 percent more likely to have died from a long fall .
They ’re also almost three times as likely to have died by drowning and twice as likely to have died after being hit by a train or other moving object , a function of New York ’s subways and waterways .
The two neighborhoods where the most nonresidents kill themselves are midtown , with its dense concentration of tall buildings and hotels , and the Washington Heights area , home to the George Washington Bridge .
Certain sites sometimes become suicide “ hot spots . ”
The world ’s most famous hot spot is perhaps the Golden Gate Bridge , where roughly 1,300 people have died since the bridge was completed , in 1937 .
The attraction is often less romantic than utilitarian .
Consciously or otherwise , experts say , people internalize a notion :
It ’s been done there before , so it can be done again .
According to Kevin Hines , who survived a jump from the Golden Gate in 2000 , the survivors he ’s met all “ decided they were going to go to this place , this icon , because they know they can die there . ”
Experts say hot spots can convince people that they are somehow less alone , even if only for an instant .
That jumping from a place where others have jumped gives them a sense of connection .
There ’s also a simple copycat component .
Suicide , Hendin notes , can become a kind of contagion .

In New York , some 30 people have jumped from the Empire State Building since it opened , in 1931 .
The George Washington Bridge sees some ten suicides per year .
In 2002 and 2003 , years in which Stephen stayed at the Marriott Marquis , three people jumped to their deaths at the hotel , two of whom lived outside New York .
In 2003 and 2004 , five New York University students jumped to their deaths from a handful of sites on and off campus .
On the morning of February 15 , 1997 , John and Marilyn Barrachina woke up at home with plans to attend a wedding later in the day .
Despite the fact that they themselves were having marital problems , Marilyn wished her husband a happy 59th birthday .
“ Maybe I ’ll just kill myself , ” John responded .
He was being dramatic , she thought , self - pitying .
But when it came time to go to the wedding , John was missing .
Marilyn did n’t imagine anything too awful could have happened , despite John ’s earlier comment .
So she , John Jr. , and her daughter - in - law went to the wedding , telling those who asked that John was sick .
They returned home to find policemen and a priest waiting at the house .
They said that at around ten o’clock that morning , John had driven roughly ten miles to the George Washington Bridge , crossed it into Manhattan , then turned right around and started back over .
On the second pass , he stopped his car , got out , and jumped .
There was no hesitation , a witness said .
He left no note .
Before the day of his 59th birthday , John Barrachina had never tried to kill himself .
He had no history of depression .
He had never talked or joked about suicide , says Marilyn .
If the family was going into the city , John Jr. says , they took the Lincoln Tunnel .
John ’s marital problems had quickly sent him into a deep depression .
But why New York ?
Why the George Washington Bridge ?
“ Living in the New York area , ” says John Jr. , “ the George Washington Bridge is an icon .
And it ’s kind of an expression .
You know — I ’ll jump off the George Washington Bridge . ”
Marilyn offers this explanation : “ I think that was just the easy way for him to do it , ” she says .
After Stephen died , Judith discovered he ’d stopped seeing his psychiatrist months earlier , had gone off his medications , and had been emptying out his room for weeks , giving away clothes , books , and even sheets and pillowcases ( he kept the receipts from the Salvation Army ) .
His suicide note mentioned relationship difficulties and laments about structural problems with his home .
Judith knows , rationally , that Stephen ’s depression is to blame for his death , but she ca n’t say , ultimately , why her son killed himself .
Nor has she settled on a single answer to why Stephen chose New York or the Marriott .
Because of the height , she guesses one moment .
Because it was far from home , she offers at another .
Judith says Stephen never mentioned the other suicides at the Marriott .
But it seems possible that he would have known about them .
As his depression deepened , she says , he probably worked out a script .
Stephen was very thorough , Judith says , very exacting .
“ He probably researched it himself . ”
New York will always have its glamour and anonymity , its tall buildings and bridges .
And the city ca n’t screen visitors to determine who ’s suicidal and who is n’t .
To some extent , so - called suicide tourism is apt to be a permanent part of our culture , a grim , unwanted side effect of some of the very things that make the city so appealing .
That said , experts say there ’s a surprisingly simple and effective way to combat the problem :
Make suicide harder to carry out , site by site , and make it easier for people to get help .
The Empire State Building has a high , inwardly curved fence encircling the observation deck and guards who keep watch , which makes jumping extremely difficult .
No one has died by jumping at the Marriott Marquis since Stephen took his own life .
During renovations of the hotel last year , Marriott erected metal grillwork that impedes access to the atrium .
After NYU ’s rash of suicides , the university expanded counseling and outreach programs , restricted access to certain dormitory balconies , and erected Plexiglas barriers in the atrium of the school ’s library , where a student had killed himself .
The George Washington Bridge , on the other hand , is heavily patrolled and monitored , and call boxes connect with Port Authority police .
But none of that changes the fact that the barriers are low and relatively easy to scale .
“ Whatever security they have , it ’s not good enough , ” says John Barrachina Jr. “ I can tell you from experience . ”
Kevin Hines has similar feelings about the Golden Gate Bridge .
The failure to build higher railings at a place where some nineteen people kill themselves each year is , he says , “ maddening , amoral , and disgusting . ”
Suicide - prevention experts also stress the importance of encouraging people who may be depressed to seek counseling .
They also say it ’s critical to promote awareness of hotlines like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline ( 800-273-talk ) .
Judith is doing her own part .
She hopes that sharing Stephen ’s story might help prevent future suicides , and having recently retired from her job , she ’s planning to volunteer at a suicide - prevention foundation .
Judith remains devastated by Stephen ’s death .
She can say his name now without crying , she says , but she still ca n’t read more than a few pages of his journals , and she has n’t been back to New York since her son died .
Of his last night here , she says , “ I hope he had the time of his life . ”
Her voice is both anguished and defiant .
“ I hope he went all around Manhattan and saw a great play and heard music that he loved . ”
Washington , D.C. -
The latest Republican proposal to amend foreign intelligence surveillance law was announced yesterday by Senator Kit Bond , and included a purported " compromise " on the issue of whether telephone companies that illegally assisted in the government 's warrantless wiretapping program should be granted immunity from lawsuits such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's ( EFF's ) lawsuit against AT&T .
" The purported immunity ' compromise ' announced on Thursday by Senator Bond is a pure sham that 's even worse than the original immunity provision passed by the Senate , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" The stacked - deck immunity determination to be made by the court apparently still does n't include any meaningful review of the telecoms ' conduct or the legality of their cooperation with the NSA , simply a review of whether the companies got a piece of paper saying that the president authorized the surveillance .
And the deck would be stacked even more by the proposed transfer to the FISA court -- the most conservative and secretive federal court in the nation .
Bottom line : it 's still immunity , and this so - called compromise concedes nothing . "
EFF represents the plaintiffs in Hepting v. AT&T , a class - action lawsuit brought by AT&T customers accusing the telecommunications company of violating their rights by illegally assisting the National Security Agency in widespread domestic surveillance .
There are nearly 40 legal cases currently pending in the Northern District of California courts that have arisen from the warrantless surveillance .

This is the most definitive history of lambda calculus of which I am aware , a most useful resource .
It includes two contradictory stories , both told by Church , of why Church picked the symbol ' lambda ' ( see p 7 ) , but not the story that Church conceived the predecessor function after exposure to laughing gas at his dentist .
( Does anyone know a source for that story ? )
My thanks to the authors for their efforts .
NEW YORK 
The number of people around the globe with at least $ 1 million in assets grew 6 % last year to 10.1 million , according to the 12th annual World Wealth Report released Tuesday by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini Group , a consulting firm .
That means an additional 600,000 people became millionaires or richer even as problems tied to the U.S. credit crisis spread in the second half of the year .
The combined wealth of the millionaires ' club meanwhile grew 9.4 % to $ 40.7 trillion .
Their average wealth , which did n't include primary homes , surpassed $ 4 million for the first time .
The super rich — those with at least $ 30 million — grew 8.8 % in population while their accumulated wealth grew 14.5 % .
This rarefied group controls about a third of the $ 40.7 trillion .
For such an elite club , 10.1 million may seem like a lot of members .
But the figure represents just 0.15 % of the world 's population of 6.7 billion .
When taking into account inflation and the expansion of the world economy , the growth in the number of people with at least $ 1 million is not surprising , said Brian Bethune , an economist with Global Insight .
The 6 % growth in the number of wealthy individuals — while down from last year 's growth of 8.3 % — is nevertheless significant , said Ileana Van Der Linde , a principal with Capgemini .
The slowest growth in the report 's 12 - year history was 2.1 % in 2002 .
India , China and Brazil saw the biggest growth rates in the number of wealthy individuals ( 22.7 % , 20.3 % , 19.1 % , respectively ) .
The United States , Japan and Germany still had the highest number of wealthy individuals , however .
The U.S. is home to about a third of those around the world with at least $ 1 million .
Steady worldwide growth powered the first half of 2007 , but more mature markets were hammered in the second half by the U.S. housing and credit crises .
Emerging economies were largely unaffected and continued robust growth into the second half of the year , the report found .
" It was a year of two halves .
We saw divergent paths starting in July , " Van Der Linde said .
The lag started showing signs of catching up with emerging economies in the beginning of 2008 , she said .
The economic slowdown resulted in the wealthy shifting their assets to safer investments , such as cash deposits and fixed - income securities .
Those two categories accounted for 44 % of the world 's wealthiest assets , up 9 percentage points from 2006 .
The wealth of the world 's richest is projected to reach $ 59.1 trillion by 2012 , advancing at a rate of 7.7 % , according to the report .

( NewsTarget ) Scientists are finding that those who choose to eat according to the principles of the Mediterranean diet have a lowered rate of death from all causes .
Research has shown that the Mediterranean diet has a beneficial effect against cardiovascular disease and is a preventative against a second heart attack .
Now we are seeing that this diet extends longevity by reducing deaths from all diseases including cancer .
Researchers reported in the December 10 , 2007a prospective study to investigate the Mediterranean dietary pattern in relation to mortality , confirming suggestions that the diet plays a beneficial role for health and longevity .
The study participants included 214,284 men and 166,012 women in the National Institutes of Health - AARP Diet and Health Study .
During follow up for all - cause mortality from 1995 to 2005 , 27,799 deaths were documented .
In the first 5 years of follow up 5,985 cancer deaths and 3,451 cardiovascular disease deaths were reported .
The researchers used a nine point score to assess conformity with the Mediterranean diet pattern with components including vegetables , legumes , fruits , nuts , whole grains , fish , monounsaturated fat - saturated fat ratio , alcohol , and meat .
They calculated hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals using age and multivariate adjusted Cox models .
Results indicated that the Mediterranean diet was associated with reduced all - cause and cause - specific mortality .
In men , the multivariate hazard ratios comparing high to low conformity for all - causes , CVD , and cancer mortality were 0.79 , 0.78 , and 0.83 .
In women , an inverse association was seen with high conformity within this pattern : decreased risks that ranged from 12 % for cancer mortality to 20 % for all - cause mortality .
Results from this study provide strong evidence of a beneficial effect from higher conformity with the Mediterranean dietary pattern on risk of death from all causes , including deaths due to cardiovascular disease and cancer in the a U.S. population .
Americans tend to associate the word diet with restriction and deprivation .
But forget this definition because the Mediterranean diet is based on the abundance of foods found in the countries of the Mediterranean Basin .
The word diet in the title is used in the traditional sense , meaning a way or style of eating .
The most commonly understood version of the diet was presented by Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard University 's School of Public Health in the mid-1990s .
It is a diet based on " food patterns typical of Crete , much of the rest of Greece , and southern Italy in the early 1960s " , according to Willett .
The traditional Mediterranean diet has been interpreted into a Pyramid with daily physical activity at its base .
Regular physical activity is seen as essential for promoting healthy weight , fitness and well - being .
Typical exercises of the Mediterranean 's might include walking , house cleaning , running , soccer , tennis , golf , swimming , hiking , scuba diving , ball games , skiing , surfing , yard work , dancing , weight lifting , and love making .
In ascending order , the Pyramid also includes : *
An abundance of food from plant sources , including fruits and vegetables , potatoes , breads and grains , beans , nuts and seeds .
Common foods on this step include pasta , rice , couscous , and polenta . *
Emphasis on a variety of minimally processed and , wherever possible , seasonally fresh and locally grown foods .
Common foods include olives , avocados , grapes , spinach , eggplant , tomatoes , broccoli , peppers , mushrooms , garlic , capers , almonds , walnuts , chick peas , white beans , lentils and other beans , and peanuts . *
Olive oil as the principle fat .
Total fat can range from less than 25 percent to over 35 percent of calories , with saturated fat no more than 7 to 8 percent of calories . *
Daily consumption of low to moderate amounts of cheese and yogurt *
Weekly consumption of low to moderate amounts of fish .
Common fish are shellfish and sardines . *
Weekly consumption of poultry , and from zero to four eggs per week including those used in cooking and baking . *
Sweets .
Common sweets are pastries , ice cream and cookies * Meat .
Common meats are veal and lamb .
It 's quite interesting that the base of the U.S. diet is often meat , but meat is at the top of the Mediterranean diet , recommended to be eaten less frequently than even sweets .
Alcohol , particularly red wine , may be consumed in moderation and with meals .
One of the main explanations for the beneficial effects of the diet is thought to be the large amount of olive oil which is seen as lowering cholesterol levels in the blood .
It is also known to lower blood sugar levels and blood pressure .
Research indicates that olive oil prevents peptic ulcers and is effective in treatment of peptic ulcer disease , and may be a factor in preventing cancer .
The consumption of red wine is considered a possible factor , as it contains flavonoids with powerful antioxidant properties .
Others suspect that is it not any one particular nutrient that confers the benefits , but rather the combination of nutrients found in this diet comprised of unprocessed foods .
The olive oil , nuts and fish of the diet contain beneficial omega - 3 fatty acids .
Studies have shown that omega - 3 fatty acids lower triglycerides and may provide an anti-inflammatory effect helping to stabilize blood vessel lining .
The Seven Countries Study found that Cretan men had exceptionally low death rates from heart disease , despite moderate to high intake of fat .
The Cretan diet is similar to other traditional Mediterranean diets , consisting mostly of olive oil , bread , fish , moderate amounts of dairy food and wine , and an abundance of fruit and vegetables .
The Lyon Diet Heart Study began as a copy of the Cretan diet , but resistance from the participants resulted in it taking a more pragmatic approach .
Since the people were reluctant to move from butter to olive oil , they used a margarine based on rapeseed ( canola ) oil .
The dietary change also included a 20 % increase in vitamin C rich fruit and bread , and decreases in processed foods and red meat .
This diet resulted in mortality from all causes being reduced by 70 % .
The study was so successful that an ethics committee decided to stop it prematurely so the results could be made immediately available to the public .
Since olive oil was not part of the diet in the Lyon Diet Heart Study , it would appear that it is not the single most important ingredient in the Mediterranean diet that it is often reported to be .
The principles of the diet can become part of your lifestyle based on the way you shop .
Here are some things to remember .
All types of olive oil provide monounsaturated fat , but " extra virgin " olive oil is the least processed form and contains the highest levels of the protective plant compounds that provide antioxidant effects .
Walnuts contain high levels of omega - 3 fatty acids .
All nuts are very nutritionally dense foods , so they should not be eaten in large amounts .
Two ounces of nuts a day is plenty .
Choose soaked or sprouted nuts .
They are available from several online dealers .
Buy natural peanut better , preferably the kind you grind yourself at the store .
This is also available online .
Keep nuts on hand for a quick snack .
Eat a variety of whole fruits and vegetables every day .
Shop by color .
Your selection of fruits and vegetables should reflect all the colors in the produce section .
Do n't try to stock up a week 's worth of fruits and vegetables .
Shop more frequently so your selection is as fresh as you can get it .
Substitute wild caught fish and natural chicken for all other meats except your monthly dose of red meat .
Choose yogurt and cheeses made according to tradition .
If you want low or no fat cheese , choose mozzarella or any cheese that has been traditionally made from skim milk .
Stay away from any yogurt or cheese that advertises itself as reduced fat , low fat , or fat free .
And do n't forget that the Mediterranean is a very sunny warm place where people feel at ease outside .
Let the sun shine on you , and let a breeze kiss your skin when you can .

Scared that the Summer Olympics in Beijing will be disrupted by protestors , the Chinese government is finally admitting that it is implementing tougher visa rules , making it more difficult to obtain one for those heading to the Games in August .
According to the Associated Press , Chinese authorities say that an invitation letter , proof of accommodation and round - trip air tickets are required for some travelers applying for a visa .
I did n’t mistype : Authorities are only saying some travelers will be affected , and are being maddeningly vague as to the specifics of the new visa rules .
All a foreign ministry flack would tell the AP is , “ We have made some arrangements according to the practice of the past Olympics and usual international practice .
That is , in the approval process we are more strict and more serious with the procedure , ”
Also , the Chinese have suspended multiple entry visas for business travelers through October , which is disrupting the business community in Hong Kong that is used to obtaining such visas easily .
The Chinese government is urging travelers to apply for visas in their home countries rather than the more common practice of applying for one in Hong Kong .
All this is in response to fears that the Games will be disrupted by human rights activists upset about China ’s crackdown in Tibet this spring .
The Olympic torch ’s journey to Beijing has been marred by protests , and some groups are pledging to take more action at the Games themselves .
Still , it ’s only now that Chinese authorities are admitting that there will be tougher visa rules .
During weeks of media speculation , the Chinese have been denying anything is different .
Director Eugene Jarecki has put together a wonderful , moving and important film that examines the modern American military machine and the modern American militaristic mindset .
His film is the 2005 Sundance Film Festival ’s Documentary Award - winning Why We Fight .
The title of the film recalls Frank Capra ’s World War II films — popular movies that promoted , eulogized and helped mythologize America ’s participation and sacrifice in that war .
We fought in World War II for many reasons , but mostly it seems , because we believed .
Why We Fight carefully illustrates how our beliefs , our national character , our shared view of ourselves as Americans have changed since World War II .
Jarecki utilizes President Eisenhower ’s famous farewell speech of January 17th , 1961 .
In this speech , Ike warned of a growing military - industrial complex , and its possible negative impact on our democracy and our republic .
As the late Colonel David Hackworth used to remind me , Eisenhower spoke of the dangers presented by military - industrial - congressional complex .
Eisenhower advised there was a " … danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific - technological elite . "
He reminded us , " Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals , so that security and liberty may prosper together .
He said ,
… we — you and I , and our government — must avoid the impulse to live only for today , plundering for , for our own ease and convenience , the precious resources of tomorrow .
We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage .
We want democracy to survive for all generations to come , not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow .
I had read , but never before actually watched Eisenhower ’s farewell speech until I saw Why We Fight .
Those who are today manning the ship of state in Washington , D.C. , like people my age , completely missed this prophetic speech .
As Ike passed the presidential baton to a fresh new face , a youthful George W. Bush , like most of his generation , was focused on high school shenanigans , and the American people basked in long - awaited economic prosperity .
Ike knew a thing or two about war , American government , and our nascent military - industrial complex .
Eisenhower worried , but we were n’t paying attention — at least in 1961 .
When asked why he made the film , Jarecki said , " Americans [ today ] have a visceral sense that something is rotten , but no - one can seem to connect the dots … .
I wanted to make this film because we need what Eisenhower called an u2018alert and knowledgeable citizenry ’ to compel change , to improve the public ’s ability to monitor those in power . "
Why We Fight is filmed in a new kind of America .
It is still filled with everyday people pulling together for glory , Capra - style .
But this documentary carefully and intelligently reveals the present - day fruition of Ike ’s darker vision .
Many everyday Americans are featured in Why We Fight .
A father who lost his son in the Twin Tower attacks on 9 - 11 .
Workers making armaments on massive factory floors , and workers writing global engagement policy prescriptions from inside carefully appointed urban thinktanks .
Politicians and contractors and military recruiters and soldiers .
These simultaneously common and uncommon people are key to the film ’s humanity and its directness — because these people are us .
However , Jarecki ’s steady hand reveals that while we are indeed Frank Capra ’s Americans , we are today , in Jarecki ’s words , " … caught in a vortex of spiraling militarisation and moral and economic bankruptcy , and [ we ] feel remote from and powerless to change those forces . "
Why We Fight grapples with this sense of moral and economic bankruptcy that many feel as we stay the course and fight wars in Iraq , and elsewhere .
The film illuminates the " insolvent phantom of tomorrow " that Ike foretold , and it attempts to get underneath the superficial explanations , and ideological perspectives .
In Jarecki ’s words , " We tend to hunt for heroes and villains , rather than study roots of the problem .
I wanted to make a film that goes beyond the focus on the individual . "
Jarecki gets it .
He understands and clearly articulates how the care and feeding of the American military leviathan has been , and remains , a shared role of both Democratic and Republican Parties .
There has n’t been an antiwar party at the national level for decades , and it is easy to see why .
What Cold War competition , massive federalization and sophisticated and relentless government agitprop pitting " us " against " them " has produced is summed up in a Raytheon worker ’s reflection on her job .
She pauses for a moment , and says , " I ’d really rather be making toys for Santa . "
But she is n’t .
Will Washington , D.C. like the film ?
It is hard to predict whether the Bush Administration or the loyal opposition in Congress will first launch a stone at Why We Fight .
Jarecki has provided an apolitical history and an apolitical reality , portraying an America evolved in the dangerous direction that Eisenhower exactly foretold .
Can the military - industrial - congressional complex be reined in ?
Should it be ?
To the extent that Jarecki passes judgment on the latter question , he defers to Eisenhower in the affirmative .
It should be " compelled " and controlled by an alert and knowledgeable citizenry , such that " security and liberty " may prosper together .
But can it be ?
The film is perhaps less optimistic of whether it can be reined in , as an interesting clip with Senator John McCain discussing the growth of the military industrial complex is cut short by an urgent phone call from the former CEO of Halliburton , and Vice President of the United States .
But what I really find inspiring about Why We Fight is that we see the words , thoughts and deeds of the average American in this movie — the factory workers , the fathers and mothers and sons and daughters , the backbone of this nation .
To a person , it is these Americans who exude patriotism and deep abiding love for this country .
It is these Americans who , with all their faults , are founts of common decency and morality .
Jarecki is excruciatingly fair in his portrayal of war - promoting policy wonks and war policy beneficiaries like Richard Perle , Bill Kristol , Don Rumsfeld , Dick Cheney and George W. Bush .
But the fact remains that these policy designers simply do n’t make a hell of a lot of sense .
Jarecki has both artfully and scientifically pulled away the curtain that currently shields the pillars of the present - day American military - industrial - congressional complex .
In a time where Abramoff , Halliburton overcharges , and Duke Cunningham - style " congressional leadership " has already publicly embarrassed Washington and the Pentagon , this film will be downplayed by the leadership in Washington , D.C. on both sides of the aisle .
These public servants and the defense corporations in league with them will say , " Enough already ! "
But Why We Fight will eagerly be consumed and digested by millions and millions of real and loyal Americans who are now weary of strange endless wars in far away places and an economy wasting under the demands of voracious spending on " defense . "
These Americans , as I did upon watching the film , will begin to really think about what we have become .
These Americans will become newly awake , newly alert , newly watchful .
These Americans will begin to embrace and assert , as did our forefathers , the blessed idea that we are governed and directed by our own consent , and none other .
Eisenhower would certainly approve .
The Best of Karen Kwiatkowski
SAN DIEGO --
In a week of epic moments at the U.S. Open , Tiger Woods delivered the biggest one yet .
It did n't bring him another major , just another chance .
Down to his last stroke Sunday afternoon at Torrey Pines , Woods rapped a 12 - foot birdie putt that bumped along toward the hole and swirled into the back corner of the cup without an inch to spare .
In a career filled with clutch putts , this one put Woods into an 18 - hole playoff Monday against Rocco Mediate , who was in the scoring room watching the 18th hole theatrics unfold on TV .
" Unbelievable , " Mediate said .
" I knew he'd make it . "
They finished at 1 - under 283 , the first time since 2004 that someone broke par in a U.S. Open .
Mediate closed with an even - par 71 , missing a chance to eliminate Woods when his wedge to the 18th stayed atop the ridge and left him a 30 - footer that he two - putted for par .
It looked like it might be good enough when Woods and Lee Westwood of England , both one shot behind , hit into the bunker on each side of the fairway on the 527 - yard closing hole and had to lay up .
Westwood went first from 15 feet above the hole , but his putt lost speed and turned away .
He shot 73 .
Woods had such a clean lie in the bunker that he might have gone for the green in two if the U.S.
Open was n't on the line .
Instead , he hit a terrible shot to the right and into the rough , and had to hope that his 60 - degree wedge was the right choice .
It settled 12 feet away , giving him yet another putt that he could n't afford to miss .
" A little wobbly down there , " he said of the poa greens , a grass that gets bumpier in the afternoon sun .
" I played probably 2 ½ holes outside right .
Just take it back and make a pure stroke , because once it starts slowing down there ... you do n't know what 's going to happen .
All I could control is my stroke . "
He started to backpedal as the putt neared the hole , paused to make sure it was in , then clenched and pumped both fists toward him in rapid - fire succession , screaming with joy with his face to the sky .
Woods was n't sure he could make it 72 holes on a left knee that has progressively gotten worse since the opening round , his first since surgery to clean out cartilage on April 15 .
He was never more thrilled to get a chance for 18 more .
He shot 73 and will be in a playoff for the third time in a major , this one 18 holes of stroke play on Monday .
Can his knee take one more round of golf ?
" It 's going to have to , " Woods replied .
The 50,000 fans at Torrey Pines , who thought they had seen it all during a most remarkable week , now get a little bit more .
Which brings us back to the “ why bother ” question and how we might better answer it .
The reasons not to bother are many and compelling , at least to the cheap - energy mind .
But let me offer a few admittedly tentative reasons that we might put on the other side of the scale :
If you do bother , you will set an example for other people .
If enough other people bother , each one influencing yet another in a chain reaction of behavioral change , markets for all manner of green products and alternative technologies will prosper and expand .
( Just look at the market for hybrid cars . )
Consciousness will be raised , perhaps even changed : new moral imperatives and new taboos might take root in the culture .
Driving an S.U.V. or eating a 24 - ounce steak or illuminating your McMansion like an airport runway at night might come to be regarded as outrages to human conscience .
Not having things might become cooler than having them .
And those who did change the way they live would acquire the moral standing to demand changes in behavior from others  from other people , other corporations , even other countries .
Image
All of this could , theoretically , happen .
What I ’m describing ( imagining would probably be more accurate ) is a process of viral social change , and change of this kind , which is nonlinear , is never something anyone can plan or predict or count on .
Who knows , maybe the virus will reach all the way to Chongqing and infect my Chinese evil twin .
Or not .
Maybe going green will prove a passing fad and will lose steam after a few years , just as it did in the 1980s , when Ronald Reagan took down Jimmy Carter ’s solar panels from the roof of the White House .
Going personally green is a bet , nothing more or less , though it ’s one we probably all should make , even if the odds of it paying off are n’t great .
Sometimes you have to act as if acting will make a difference , even when you ca n’t prove that it will .
That , after all , was precisely what happened in Communist Czechoslovakia and Poland , when a handful of individuals like Vaclav Havel and Adam Michnik resolved that they would simply conduct their lives “ as if ” they lived in a free society .
That improbable bet created a tiny space of liberty that , in time , expanded to take in , and then help take down , the whole of the Eastern bloc .
So what would be a comparable bet that the individual might make in the case of the environmental crisis ?
Havel himself has suggested that people begin to “ conduct themselves as if they were to live on this earth forever and be answerable for its condition one day . ”
Fair enough , but let me propose a slightly less abstract and daunting wager .
The idea is to find one thing to do in your life that does n’t involve spending or voting , that may or may not virally rock the world but is real and particular ( as well as symbolic ) and that , come what may , will offer its own rewards .
Maybe you decide to give up meat , an act that would reduce your carbon footprint by as much as a quarter .
Or you could try this : determine to observe the Sabbath .
For one day a week , abstain completely from economic activity : no shopping , no driving , no electronics .
But the act I want to talk about is growing some  even just a little  of your own food .
Rip out your lawn , if you have one , and if you do n’t  if you live in a high - rise , or have a yard shrouded in shade  look into getting a plot in a community garden .
Measured against the Problem We Face , planting a garden sounds pretty benign , I know , but in fact it ’s one of the most powerful things an individual can do  to reduce your carbon footprint , sure , but more important , to reduce your sense of dependence and dividedness : to change the cheap - energy mind .
A great many things happen when you plant a vegetable garden , some of them directly related to climate change , others indirect but related nevertheless .
Growing food , we forget , comprises the original solar technology : calories produced by means of photosynthesis .
Years ago the cheap - energy mind discovered that more food could be produced with less effort by replacing sunlight with fossil - fuel fertilizers and pesticides , with a result that the typical calorie of food energy in your diet now requires about 10 calories of fossil - fuel energy to produce .
It ’s estimated that the way we feed ourselves ( or rather , allow ourselves to be fed ) accounts for about a fifth of the greenhouse gas for which each of us is responsible .
Yet the sun still shines down on your yard , and photosynthesis still works so abundantly that in a thoughtfully organized vegetable garden ( one planted from seed , nourished by compost from the kitchen and involving not too many drives to the garden center ) , you can grow the proverbial free lunch  CO2 - free and dollar - free .
This is the most - local food you can possibly eat ( not to mention the freshest , tastiest and most nutritious ) , with a carbon footprint so faint that even the New Zealand lamb council dares not challenge it .
And while we ’re counting carbon , consider too your compost pile , which shrinks the heap of garbage your household needs trucked away even as it feeds your vegetables and sequesters carbon in your soil .
What else ?
Well , you will probably notice that you ’re getting a pretty good workout there in your garden , burning calories without having to get into the car to drive to the gym .
( It is one of the absurdities of the modern division of labor that , having replaced physical labor with fossil fuel , we now have to burn even more fossil fuel to keep our unemployed bodies in shape . )
Also , by engaging both body and mind , time spent in the garden is time ( and energy ) subtracted from electronic forms of entertainment .
Whether you ’re trying to keep fit , have a fitness resolution , or you want to keep track of your body , a fitness band will help you .

Cool Earth , a British environmental group , has declared itself to be " bewildered " at reports that the Brazilian authorities were investigating the activities of its founder Johan Eliasch for allegedly urging foreigners to buy up the Amazon rainforest .
Hopelessly naive might be a better description .
Eliasch , a Swedish - born businessman , is a former deputy treasurer of the Conservative party , and now serves as Gordon Brown 's special representative for deforestation .
In the course of a speech in 2006 he said that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico had cost insurance companies " $ 75 bn " ( £ 38 bn ) and it might be cheaper to buy the entire Brazilian rainforest for " $ 50 bn " ( £ 26 bn ) thereby preventing deforestation and making hurricanes less frequent .
Eliasch has himself bought up around 400,000 acres of Amazon rainforest , an area about the size of Sao Paulo , Brazil 's biggest city .
He made the purchase in 2005 and is believed to have paid around £ 8 m for it .
According to its website , the idea behind Cool Earth is that " rainforests are worth much more left standing – both for the planet and for local communities . "
His organisation , Cool Earth , invites people to donate money to " secure one area of land that would otherwise be sold to loggers and ranchers and to price deforestation out of the market " .
The charity says that it puts its money into a local trust and that it " employs local people to do the work , helping them to get income from the forest without cutting it down , and make sure the rainforest is worth more standing than cut down " .
" For as little as £ 70 you can protect a whole acre " it tells potential donors , while £ 35 protects half an acre .
So far , so worthy , but the combination of Eliasch 's remarks and activities have now caused a growing backlash amongst Brazilians outraged by the notion that they cannot be trusted to take care of the Amazon themselves .
Last week President Lula said that said that foreigners need to " understand that the Amazon has an owner , and that is the Brazilian people " .
On Monday one of Brazil 's main newspapers reported that the police and intelligence services were investigating Eliasch for his claim about buying the forest and Carlos Minc , Brazil 's new environment minister , said he was shocked by the report .
He announced that one of his first acts in his new post would be to open an inquiry into the matter and it has also been raised within the ministry for external affairs .
Brazil 's most popular television show , Fantastico , conducted an interview with Eliasch in which the reporter asked him to explain how Cool Earth came up with its costings for saying that " £ 35 saves 22 trees , six threatened animals , 11,000 insects and so on " .
She also asked whether he considered the attempt to buy up the natural heritage of another country to be a form of neo-colonialism .
Eliasch refused to say how much he had paid for the land that he has already bought , but denied that he intended to buy up the forest " piece by piece " .
" I am just a person who adores trees " , he told the journalist .
Matthew Owen , the director of Cool Earth , has issued a statement saying that the organisation " does not own any land in Amazon , we fund conservation projects but we are not interested in owning lands which we think would be an inappropriate use of a UK - based charity . "
He added , " the ownership of the Amazon is a very politicised topic and understandably the government wants to understand what all players are doing .
We are successful in bringing ... funding for the protection of the Amazon but there is no evidence whatsoever that we infringed any regulations . "
Cool Earth 's only real offence has probably been a marketing campaign , which might appeal to potential donors but is grossly insensitive towards the feelings of its intended beneficiaries – a bit like the " sponsor a black baby " adverts that some aid charities used to run .
The reality is that the organisation could not buy up the Amazon , even if it wanted to , since much of it is already in public hands .
However , as Greenpeace Brazil has pointed out , Cool Earth could actually exacerbate the problem caused by the profusion of false property titles which means that it might end up funding the grilleiros ( land - grabbers ) and buying lands that are already protected by law .
The storm that it has generated has also diverted attention from the far more worrying news of a sharp rise in the rate of deforestation this year as higher food prices push farmers to expand their slash - and - burn clearances .
Tackling this will be the first priority of Carlos Minc , who was appointed to the post last month , following the resignation of the highly respected Marina Silva .
The Brazilian government needs external help to support its efforts but Eliasch 's comments , which echo an earlier remark by Al Gore that " contrary to what Brazilians think , the Amazon is not their property " are patronising , offensive and massively counterproductive .
Netherlands ( TGW ) –
The avalanche effect by electrons in fact does occur in specific , very small semiconducting crystals , according to researchers TU Delft in the Netherlands .
This discovery could pave the way for cheap , high - output solar cells .
Cool looking solar thermal panels
One possible improvement to current solar cells could be solar cells manufactured from semiconducting extremely small crystals .
Conventional solar cells can produce exactly one light particle ( a photon ) can release exactly one energy particle ( an electron ) .
In some semiconducting crystals , however , one photon can release two or three electrons , hence the term avalanche effect .
According to the researchers , solar cells with these crystals can be manufactured relatively cheaply .
This could theoretically lead to solar cell efficiency of 44 % , much higher than today ’s solar cell ’s .
The current record for solar cell efficiency is 42.8 % , but the average efficiency for commercial solar cells is around 14 - 19 % Via :: Press Release
US : Israeli military carried out Iran practice drill Diane Sweet
Published : Friday June 20 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Friday 's New York Times is reporting that multiple U.S. officials have stated that the Israeli military carried out what seemed to be a ' rehearsal ' for a strike directed at Iran 's nuclear facilities .
The exercise seemed ' to be an effort to develop the militarys capacity to carry out long - range strikes and to demonstrate the seriousness with which Israel views Irans nuclear program . '
The exercise is said to have taken place the first week of June over the eastern Mediterranean and Greece included over 100 Israeli fighter planes , as well as helicopters , and refueling tankers flying over 900 miles ; the approximate distance between Israel and Iran 's uranium enrichment plant at Natanz .
Israel has carried out two unilateral attacks on suspected nuclear sites , one in 1981 against Iraqs nuclear plant at Osirak , and on a Syrian structure last September that U.S. officials said housed a nuclear reactor , but as it was reported by Raw Story 's Larisa Alexandrovna was in fact a cache of North Korean missiles .
Pentagon officials said that Israel usually conducts a ' major ' early summer air force training exercise , but that the early June exercise was larger , and included ' a lengthy combat rescue mission . '
 They rehearse it , rehearse it and rehearse it , so if they actually have to do it , they re ready ,  the Pentagon official said .
 They re not taking any options off the table . 
The Pentagon official 's words echoing President Bush 's remarks on Iran made in Germany during his recent European tour : " My first choice of course is to solve this diplomatically .
All options are all the table , but the first choice is to solve this problem by working closely together , " said Bush after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel .

LPGA Superstar Annika Sorenstam Announces Retirement
After a brilliant 15 year career , LPGA celebrityis hanging it up .
The phenom took home the 72nd golf title of her career on Sunday and announced that she plans to retire at the end of the season .
2007 was a rough season for the Swedish athlete who remained winless due to injuries .
This year the 37 year old golfer has won three tournaments .
With her win on Sunday at the Michelob Ultra Open , Sorenstam has career earning of $ 22 million .
Sorenstam was quoted saying :
I have given it my all and it has been fun .
I came back from an injury last year .
I am healthy .
I feel good .
I have started strong this season and I will be leaving the game on my own terms . "
Sorenstam dropped to number two on the money list and in the world rankings a year ago .
Mexico 'sis number one in both categories .
Before this season is over , Sorenstam will attempt to get the number one spot back .
She has been in 8 tournaments in 2008 , finishing in the top 10 ( 3 wins ) in all but one outing .
Annika will marry Mike McFee in January 2009 and plans to devote herself to her golf academy and golf course architecture firm and she is also focused on starting a family , something that would have been difficult while on the tour .
Do n't put it past Sorenstam to recapture her top status before the year is over .
She 's hot right now and there 's no telling what she can accomplish .
Stay tuned .
She called it from her home phone but heard nothing .
Finally , while making dinner a few hours later , she found it  in the freezer .
She was so unnerved , not just by that but also by the poor results of a subsequent mental status test , that she had an MRI done on her brain .
The diagnosis : perfectly normal .
Dr. Cohen said people can also overreact , attributing absent - minded actions to failing brains , when it is actually simple distractibility that is to blame .
Nancy Cutler , 51 , a publication designer in Piedmont , Calif. , grew worried about her brain a few years ago when she drove her car to work one day , then , forgetting she had done so , took the bus home .
“ It was pretty embarrassing to have my kid call me and say , ‘ what do you mean you ’re on the bus ? ’ ”
Ms. Cutler reminded herself that she was preparing for her son ’s bar mitzvah , going through a stressful period and was very distracted .
But she was concerned enough to report the incident to her physician , and ask if there were certain supplements she should be taking .
The doctor told her to take up activities that challenged her mind .
( Ms. Cutler said she had not done anything yet , because it is “ a real time commitment . ” )
Dr. Cohen , who recently conducted a study of people born from 1946 to 1955 , the first half of the baby boom , said he was struck by the number of respondents who believe they can do things on their own to enhance the vitality of their brains .
“ There is a gradual growing awareness that challenging your brain can have positive effects , " Dr. Cohen said .
He said the plasticity of the brain is directly related to the production of new dendrites , the branched , tree - like neural projections that carry electrical signals through the brain “ Every time you challenge your brain it will actually modify the brain , ” he said .
“ We can indeed form new brain cells , despite a century of being told it ’s impossible . ”
In pursuit of his own dendritic growth , Dr. Cohen plans to take up the piano again after years of not playing .
He is also sketching out a science - fiction novel he hopes to write .

Boris Johnson told he will be ' gone after Brexit ' in dire forecast over political future
BORIS JOHNSON has been warned his tenure as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is likely to come to an end shortly after securing the " best EU trade deal . "
This is a " Knock Down Drag Out " forum that will test the very limits of the discussions which others are afraid to touch .
Politically incorrect and straight to the point .
Lose one , find one .
China thinks the white dolphin in the Yangtze River went extinct , that ’s one lost , but good news today .
China is adding a new species of bird to the wildlife list .
It ’s called the Nonggang Babbler .
It has a white crescent - shaped patch behind the ear , grayish - brown spots on a white throat and the rest is dark brown .
The babbler likes to walk instead of fly and feeds on worms and insects in between rocks .
It flies only when scared .
The new addition to wildlife species was discovered by ornithologists in a small patch of limestone rainforest on the Sino - Vietnamese border .
The bird was first spotted four years ago by a professor of the College of Animal Sciences and Technology and one of his grad students .
In the subsequent four years studies and fieldwork were conducted to confirm the bird was a new species .
The prof said he had been studying birds for more than 30 years .
Stachyris nonggangensis ( Nonggang Babbler ) is the name of this new discovery .
The discovery has been confirmed by the Auk – world ’s leading journal on ornithology .
The last time a new bird was found in China was in the 1930s .
The prof went on to say “ It is very difficult to restore the biodiversity of a rainforest once its ecological is disturbed .
Given the bird ’s small number and its threatened habitat , it ’s important to include it in the State list of protected species . ”
In other words , now that I found this new bird , let ’s make sure we do n’t lose it .
Birdwatchers everywhere can be found making reservations to go to the Sino - Vietnamese border .

How the Pentagon manipulated the media to promote the Iraq war
By David Walsh
25 April 2008
On April 20 , the New York Times published a lengthy article by investigative reporter David Barstow detailing the US Defense Department ’s extensive and ongoing program of manipulating news coverage of the Iraq war .
The article provides a glimpse into the intimate connections between the government , military and mass media and the means by which they have attempted to package and sell a neo-colonial war to the US population .
Barstow writes that the record indicates a “ symbiotic relationship where the usual dividing lines between government and journalism have been obliterated . ”
Essentially , the US mass media has allowed itself to become little more than a propaganda instrument of American militarism .
According to the April 20 piece , more than 75 retired officers have been coached by government and military officials to ‘ spin ’ the news about Iraq — or simply lie — on countless network and cable channel news programs and talk shows over the course of the past five years or more .
Fox News has led the way in presenting these individuals to the public , but NBC , CNN , CBS and ABC have followed suit .
The military analysts have not simply propagandized for ideological reasons ; in many cases , they work for defense contractors and are “ in the business of helping companies win military contracts . ”
The existence of such a program , worthy of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels , will come as no surprise to anyone who has observed the increasing resort to anti-democratic and illegal methods by the White House and the Pentagon .
The military analysts ’ program was put in place prior to the invasion of Iraq .
Indeed , as the Times makes clear , “ even before Sept.11 , ” Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke had “ built a system within the Pentagon to recruit ‘ key influentials , ’ ” who might be called on to “ generate support ” for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ’s policies .
By early 2002 , as detailed planning for an Iraq invasion was under way , the Bush administration encountered an “ obstacle ” — US public opinion .
“ Many Americans , polls showed , were uneasy about invading a country with no clear connection to the Sept. 11 attacks .
Pentagon and White House officials believed the military analysts could play a crucial role in helping overcome this resistance . ”
Clarke and her team set about recruiting the analysts , all of whom were personally approved by Rumsfeld ( and with whom he met as a group at least 18 times ) .
“ In the fall and winter leading up to the invasion , ” writes Barstow , “ the Pentagon armed its analysts with talking points portraying Iraq as an urgent threat .
The basic case became a familiar mantra : Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons , was developing nuclear weapons , and might one day slip some to Al Qaeda ; an invasion would be a relatively quick and inexpensive ‘ war of liberation . ’ ”
The analysts then obediently repeated the administration ’s line all over the broadcast media .
As one of Clarke ’s lieutenants told the Times , on certain days , “ We were able to click on every single station and every one of our folks were up there delivering our message .
You ’d look at them and say , ‘ This is working . ’ ”
The analysts were instructed not to indicate they had been briefed and prepared by the Defense Department .
The increasingly disastrous character of the war , along with revelations of torture and abuse at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , provided further opportunities for the military experts to be trotted out before the public .
In September 2003 , for instance , as the insurgency was beginning to have an impact and the administration was attempting to justify Bush ’s request for $ 87 billion in war financing , a group of analysts — four from Fox , one each from CBS and ABC — were invited to tour Iraq and promised a look at “ the real situation on the ground . ”
Needless to say , on their return , they offered glowing reports about the situation .
Paul E. Vallely , a retired army general who specialized in psychological warfare , told Fox News , about the conditions in Iraq , “ You ca n’t believe the progress . ”
He predicted the insurgency would be washed up within months .
Barstow makes the point that the trip also “ represented a business opportunity : direct access to the most senior and military leaders in Iraq and Kuwait , ” some of whom had decision - making power over how the billions of US dollars were to be spent .
Media treatment of the horrific conditions at Guantánamo was another source of major concern at the Pentagon .
Groups of analysts visited the base six times from June 2005 to counter “ the growing perception ” of the internment camp “ as an international symbol of inhumane treatment . ”
The collection of retired officers carried out their assignment .
“ The analysts went on TV and radio , decrying Amnesty International , criticizing calls to close the facility and asserting that all detainees were treated humanely . ”
The Pentagon analyst program is apparently illegal under US statutes .
A provision of the Smith - Mundt Act of 1948 forbids the Voice of America from disseminating information about the US and its policies domestically .
The Foreign Relations
Act of 1972 amended that act to include a ban on disseminating within the US any “ information about the United States , its people , and its policies ” prepared for distribution abroad .
The so - called Zorinsky Amendment ( named after Nebraska Democratic Senator Edward Zorinsky ) of 1985 forbids US Information Agency funds to “ be used to influence public opinion in the United States . ”
The article concentrates on the television appearances of the military analysts , and this was undoubtedly where they had their greatest impact .
Barstow is too modest , however , about the role played by the print media and the New York Times in particular .
He notes merely that members of the group “ often published op - ed articles or were quoted in magazines , web sites and newspapers .
At least nine of them have written op - ed articles for the Times . ”
Editor & Publisher points out that a number of the analysts were regularly cited in the press and that one of their number , Gen .
Barry McCaffrey , was quoted often in 2002 and 2003 in support of the attack on Iraq and wrote op - eds for the Washington Post .
Thomas McInerney , “ one of the prominent cabal members , ” writes Editor & Publisher , “ shows up in several Times articles since 2002 — as late as 2006 he is quoted as still believing Saddam had WMD and simply hid them in Syria and elsewhere . ”
In an online question - and - answer session April 21 , Andrew Rosenthal , editorial page editor , responded to a question about the Times op - ed pieces written by Pentagon analysts .
Rosenthal refers to only one of the pieces by name , “ Rebels , Guns and Money ” ( November 10 , 2004 ) , authored by retired army Gen. James A. Marks .
He claims blandly that the column “ discussed the tactics , strategies and techniques involved in urban warfare , looking ahead to an impending military assault on the city of Falluja .
General Marks did not take a stand on how the war was going in Iraq . ”
This is serious misrepresentation of Marks ’ repellent propaganda piece .
First of all , Rosenthal claims that the assault was “ impending ” on November 10 .
In fact , the attack by US marines began November 8 , and by November 10 it was already clear that a major war crime was underway .
The Times does not care to reveal that it published an article celebrating the destruction of a major city while it was taking place .
Marks ’ article begins triumphantly , “ The Marine and Army forces now entering Falluja , Iraq have prepared for this fight for some time , and not just since the collapse of Saddam Hussein ’s regime last spring . ”
It strongly touts the US forces ’ prowess at “ urban fighting . ”
The piece is meant to prepare the American public for the devastation and loss of life in Fallujah .
“ We will use precision weapons where there is a high probability of killing innocent Iraqis , but for the most part we will use conventional artillery , mortars and rockets .
Buildings will crumple — the train station demolished on Monday will not be the last [ so much for Rosenthal ’s “ impending ” ] — because we will destroy them and so will the insurgents .
Dust will be everywhere , small fires and smoke will obscure the vision of our troops and the enemy .
“ But it will not be as out of control as it may seem ; the destruction will have a purpose ...
Our goal is to bring democracy and liberty to Iraq , and that wo n’t happen if we destroy whole cities and towns .
Fortunately , our soldiers have extensive training in urban operations down to the platoon and company level . ”
Marks concludes by asking rhetorically when American troops would come home , and continues : “ One of the most difficult aspects of counter - insurgency operations is deciding when to declare victory and head on home , and it is far too early to even begin thinking about that .
But with each American and Iraqi soldier that steps into Falluja this week , we are that much closer to the end . ”
The retired general , as part of the Pentagon propaganda campaign , was making the case on the pages of the New York Times for mass murder .
In any event , the Times did not especially need the intervention of outside “ experts . ”
It had a sufficient number of internal advocates for the Iraq war and for US domination of the Middle East in columnist Thomas Friedman and reporters like Judith Miller and Michael Gordon .
During the buildup to the war , Miller ’s articles on Iraqi WMD served as a transmission belt for government misinformation and lies .
The pieces , it later emerged , were largely based on information provided by Iraqi exile leader and convicted embezzler Ahmad Chalabi .
The whole operation was directed by the office of Vice President Dick Cheney and the civilian leadership in the Pentagon .
The response of the US media to the revelation of the Pentagon campaign to manage the war news has been largely to ignore it .
The television networks , the guiltiest parties in Barstow ’s piece , have either stonewalled inquiries or played the innocent victim .
CBS News and Fox would n’t make any comment at all .
NBC
News issued a brief and evasive statement , claiming it had policies in place “ to assure that the people who appear on our air have been appropriately vetted and that nothing in their profile would lead to even a perception of a conflict of interest . ”
CNN officials said they were unaware that Gen .
Marks , one of its main analysts , was , according to Barstow , “ deeply involved in the business of seeking government contracts , including contracts related to Iraq . ”
The network executives knew precisely what was going on with their military analysts and approved the program .
They were as interested as the government and the military in spreading false information to justify an invasion and occupation .
As the complicity of the Democrats in Congress has underscored , the need to control Middle East oil reserves is the consensus policy of the American ruling elite .
The moral and intellectual deterioration of the American media has reached an advanced stage .
The US has become a society dominated by massive social differentiation .
The top officials at the media conglomerates are enormously sensitive to the need to conceal social reality in America as well as the consequences of US foreign policy .
In 1922 , at a time when America was a rising political and industrial power , the liberal journalist and political commentator Walter Lippmann could write confidently that “ on the whole , the quality of the news about modern society is an index of its social organization .
The better the institutions , the more all interests concerned are formally represented , the more issues are disentangled , the more objective criteria are introduced , the more perfectly an affair can be presented as news . ”
Following from Lippmann , the opposite holds true as well .
‘ The worse the institutions ... ’
Startup mythology demands that to create something great , you need superhuman sacrifices .
You need to work for no pay , you need to put in 120 hours / week , you need to preferably sleep under the desk and live off pizza as a sole form of nutrient .
As a result , you need to abandon your family and risk life without insurance .
Hogwash !
We ’ve repeated this story so many times that it ’s starting to wear a little thin , but here it goes again : Basecamp was created with 10 hours / week of programming time and as a 3rd or 4th project alongside paying customers for the designers over the course of about 6 months .
In other words , we did n’t drop everything we had to create Basecamp , and you do n’t have to either .
There are plenty of startup ideas that can be done without millions in funding , thousands of man hours , and dramatic risk .
But I can excuse people from failing to see them when blinded by press and popular opinion .
Everywhere you turn it ’s stories about how ever - younger entrepreneurs with nothing to lose are defying all odds and making mortal sacrifices to reach their impossibly unlikely goals and succeeding .
Did I say hogwash already ?
How about you turn your perceived weaknesses into strengths .
Embrace your constraints , work with limited budget of your own money and write less software .
That ’s how we built Basecamp on the side , next to the every day obligations of paying the bills and having a life .
It did n’t turn into a smash hit overnight either .
We ran Basecamp for a year alongside our other obligations before it was doing well enough to pay all the bills and afford our full - time attention .
Most good businesses did n’t become great ones within the 12 - 18 months that the poster boys of the startup lottery did .
So do n’t despair , just start small .
Reserve a couple of nights per week , a Sunday morning here , and a day from vacation time there .
It ’s never been cheaper or faster to build a web startup , it ’s never been more possible to do it as a side - business .
That still does n’t make it easy .
Odds are you ’ll fail .
Just as odds are you ’ll fail if you take millions of VC money , hire a staff of twenty , and spend 120 hours / week on it .
But if lost opportunity is a risk when you try , it ’s a guarantee if you do n’t .
For political junkies , part of the fun of watching politics is reading the tea leaves .
Admit it .
Most of you probably saw friends over the weekend -- a little barbecue , maybe , or a kids ' sports match .
And if you talked about politics , chances are good the conversation included a little chatter about how and where the Democrats are going to finish up after Tuesday 's final votes in Montana and So uth Dakota .
Well , three fresh factoids have caught our eye .
First , Hillary Clinton announced this morning that she 'll spend Tuesday evening in New York , the city that never sleeps and that she represents in the U.S. Senate .
Not in Montana or South Dakota , where people are voting , but New York City .
Second , Bill Clinton told folks in South Dakota this morning that " this may be the last day I 'm ever involved in a campaign of this kind .
I thought I was out of politics , till Hillary decided to run .
But it has been one of the greatest honors of my life to go around and campaign for her for president . "
Third , the folks at Politico report that Mo Elleithee , a Clinton spokesman , tells them that " we just have n't figured out our schedule past Tuesday , " so many members of the advance team are being sent home .
( UPDATE : A fourth factoid -- Tom Edsall reports over on Huffington Post that Clinton has taken the " unusual move " of summoning " top donors and backers to attend her speech " Tuesday night in New York . )
Barack Obama has scheduled his own election - night event in St. Paul , site of the September Republican National Convention , and his event can be read as a salvo across the bow for the fall election .
What can be inferred from Clinton 's picking New York City ?
Well , it is close to home , and it would be a symbolic place to announce that she is ending her historic run for the White House and devoting her full attentions to the Senate job .
Of course , it could be she just wants to repack a suitcase to start visiting superdelegates in person .
But after the Democratic rules committee decision Saturday , the steady seepage of superdelegates Obama 's way , and the campaign telling its advance people to take some time off , you gotta wonder .
( UPDATE II : Our colleague Noam Levey reports from South Dakota that Elleithee told reporters aboard the campaign plane this afternoon that " we do not expect a nominee will be clear tomorrow night , " signaling that the campaign probably would not end Tuesday .
But the Associated Press reports that Clinton advisor Harold Ickes and fundraising director Jonathan Mantz told donors Monday that Clinton probably would n't appeal the DNC rules committee decision , and that the campaign expected Obama to secure enough delegates by Wednesday to claim victory . )

WASHINGTON - Advocates for the blind want the government to set minimum sound standards for new cars and trucks , pointing to potential safety hazards for blind pedestrians who can't hear silent gas-electric hybrid vehicles .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration held a daylong hearing yesterday to discuss the issue , which has been raised by organizations that represent about 1.1 million legally blind Americans .
" For us , these cars are invisible , " said Deborah Kent Stein of the National Federation of the Blind .
Stein and representatives of other organizations for the blind said hybrid vehicles are difficult for blind pedestrians to detect , since they use traffic sounds to determine when it 's safe to cross the street .
They asked the government to conduct more research into the issue and require cars to emit minimum decibel levels .
Industry officials said they hoped to begin preliminary testing later this year to quantify typical noise emissions from vehicles .
But they said the issue is complicated because so many things contribute to traffic sounds : engines , tires hitting the road , wind resistance , and background noise .
" There are a lot of things that we simply do n't know at this point , " said Chris Tinto , a Toyota Motor Corp.
vice president who is leading an industry panel reviewing the issue .
During the meeting , researchers played audio tapes comparing the sounds of hybrids with vehicles that have conventional engines .
In one experiment , blindfolded listeners could n't hear a 2006 Toyota Prius until it was about 11 feet away , compared with a 2004 Honda Accord , which the listeners detected from a distance of about 36 feet .
Some lawmakers are taking notice .
US Representatives Ed Towns , a Democrat from New York , and Cliff Stearns , a Republican from Florida , introduced legislation in April that would require a two - year study of the issue by NHTSA .
Hybrid vehicles operate on battery - powered electric motors at low speeds and when idling , reducing the amount of sound from the vehicle compared with conventional cars and trucks .

No one with any scientific sense now disagrees about the severity of the climate crisis .
But some people — and some magazines — believe that climate change trumps every other problem .
If we take this argument to its extreme , we should ignore any environmental concern that gets in the way of reducing emissions .
And that 's just plain wrong .
Make no mistake : Tackling climate change is vital .
But to see everything through the lens of short - term CO 2 reductions , letting our obsession with carbon blind us to the bigger picture , is to court catastrophe .
Climate change is not a discrete issue ; it 's a symptom of larger problems .
Fundamentally , our society as currently designed has no future .
We 're chewing up the planet so fast , in so many different ways , that we could solve the climate problem tomorrow and still find that environmental collapse is imminent .
Myopic responses will only hasten its arrival .
Take the proposal that we cut down old trees in favor of new ones .
First , I do n't buy the carbon accounting presented to advance this procrustean plan :
Older trees can absorb CO 2 for centuries after reaching maturity , while replanted forests can emit more CO 2 than they sequester until the new trees are as much as 20 years old .
But even if wired 's math were correct , this would still be a crap fix for climate change .
Chopping down forests causes massive soil erosion and leads to desertification , making repeated tree plantings a dodgy prospect .
As monocultures , tree farms are far more vulnerable to pest infestations .
And batches of trees planted at the same time are more susceptible to wildfires , causing the carbon they 're supposed to be sequestering to go up in smoke .
Old - growth forests , coupled with a broad program of woodlands restoration and sustainable forestry , can provide not only climate relief and ecologically responsible wood and biomass harvests but a slew of other essential ecological services , from salmon habitats to flood prevention .
It 's a heck of a lot more costly — in both money and emissions — to build massive dams and fish farms than to simply protect the forests we already have .
Another example of how carbon blindness leads to counterproductive policies : embracing nuclear power as a clean energy source .
This argument assumes that other clean alternatives will not improve in efficiency or affordability during the 10 years it would take to implement a nuclear program .
That 's short - term thinking .
If we invested the money that we would spend on new nuclear facilities more wisely ( and eliminated subsidies on fossil fuels ) , alternatives like wind , solar , hydroelectric , and wave power could deliver a clean - energy future more cheaply and probably sooner , without any of the security or health risks of nuclear plants .
Nuclear power may have a role to play , but it would be far better to create a flexible energy system that draws on many clean sources , instead of on a single panacea .
Again , a cut - carbon - at - all - costs approach blinds us to more - sustainable , and ultimately more - promising , solutions .
To have any hope of staving off collapse , we need to move forward with measures that address many interrelated problems at once .
We 're not going to persuade people in the developing world to go without , but neither can we afford a planet on which everyone lives like an American .
Billions more people living in suburbs and driving SUVs to shopping malls is a recipe for planetary suicide .
We can't even afford to continue that way of life ourselves .
We do n't need a War on Carbon .
We need a new prosperity that can be shared by all while still respecting a multitude of real ecological limits — not just atmospheric gas concentrations , but topsoil depth , water supplies , toxic chemical concentrations , and the health of ecosystems , including the diversity of life they depend upon .
We can build a future in which technology , design , smart incentives , and wise policies make it possible to deliver a high quality of life at lower ecological cost .
But that brighter , greener future is attainable only if we embrace the problems we face in all their complexity .
To do otherwise is tantamount to clear - cutting the very future we 're trying to secure .

ANN ARBOR — If you could hold a giant magnifying glass in space and focus all the sunlight shining toward Earth onto one grain of sand , that concentrated ray would approach the intensity of a new laser beam made in a University of Michigan laboratory .
“ That ’s the instantaneous intensity we can produce , ” said Karl Krushelnick , a physics and engineering professor .
“ I do n’t know of another place in the universe that would have this intensity of light .
We believe this is a record . ”
The pulsed laser beam lasts just 30 femtoseconds .
A femtosecond is a millionth of a billionth of a second .
The beam is twice as intense as one the researchers produced in 2004 .
Such intense beams could help scientists develop better proton and electron beams for radiation treatment of cancer , among other applications .
The record - setting beam measures 20 billion trillion watts per square centimeter .
It contains 300 terawatts of power .
That ?s 300 times the capacity of the entire U.S. electricity grid .
The laser beam ’s power is concentrated to a 1.3 - micron speck about 100th the diameter of a human hair .
A human hair is about 100 microns wide .
This intensity is about two orders of magnitude higher than any other laser in the world can produce , said Victor Yanovsky , a research scientist in the U - M Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science who built the ultra - high power system over the past six years .
The laser can produce this intense beam once every 10 seconds , whereas other powerful lasers can take an hour to recharge .
“ We can get such high power by putting a moderate amount of energy into a very , very short time period , ” Yanovsky said .
“ We ’re storing energy and releasing it in a microscopic fraction of a second . ”
To achieve this beam , the research team added another amplifier to the HERCULES laser system , which previously operated at 50 terawatts .
HERCULES is a titanium - sapphire laser that takes up several rooms at U - M ’s Center for Ultrafast Optical Science .
Light fed into it bounces like a pinball off a series of mirrors and other optical elements .
It gets stretched , energized , squeezed and focused along the way .
HERCULES uses the technique of chirped pulse amplification developed by U - M engineering professor emeritus Gerard Mourou in the 1980s .
Chirped pulse amplification relies on grooved surfaces called diffraction gratings to stretch a very short duration laser pulse so that it lasts 50,000 times longer .
This stretched pulse can then be amplified to much higher energy without damaging the optics in its path .
After the beam is amplified to a higher energy by passing through titanium - sapphire crystals , an optical compressor reverses the stretching , squeezing the laser pulse until it ?s close to its original duration .
The beam is then focused to ultra - high intensity .
In addition to medical uses , intense laser beams like these could help researchers explore new frontiers in science .
At even more extreme intensities , laser beams could potentially “ boil the vacuum , ” which scientists theorize would generate matter by merely focusing light into empty space .
Some scientists also see applications in inertial confinement fusion research , coaxing low - mass atoms to join together into heavier ones and release energy in the process .
A paper on this research , “ Ultra - high intensity 300 - TW laser at 0.1 Hz repetition rate , ” is published online in the journal Optics Express .

PICTURES of hunger usually show passive eyes and swollen bellies .
The harvest fails because of war or strife ; the onset of crisis is sudden and localised .
Its burden falls on those already at the margin .
Today 's pictures are different .
“ This is a silent tsunami , ” says Josette Sheeran of the World Food Programme , a United Nations agency .
A wave of food - price inflation is moving through the world , leaving riots and shaken governments in its wake .
For the first time in 30 years , food protests are erupting in many places at once .
Bangladesh is in turmoil ( see article ) ; even China is worried ( see article ) .
Elsewhere , the food crisis of 2008 will test the assertion of Amartya Sen , an Indian economist , that famines do not happen in democracies .
Famine traditionally means mass starvation .
The measures of today 's crisis are misery and malnutrition .
The middle classes in poor countries are giving up health care and cutting out meat so they can eat three meals a day .
The middling poor , those on $ 2 a day , are pulling children from school and cutting back on vegetables so they can still afford rice .
Those on $ 1 a day are cutting back on meat , vegetables and one or two meals , so they can afford one bowl .
The desperate — those on 50 cents a day — face disaster .
Roughly a billion people live on $ 1 a day .
If , on a conservative estimate , the cost of their food rises 20 % ( and in some places , it has risen a lot more ) , 100 m people could be forced back to this level , the common measure of absolute poverty .
In some countries , that would undo all the gains in poverty reduction they have made during the past decade of growth .
Because food markets are in turmoil , civil strife is growing ; and because trade and openness itself could be undermined , the food crisis of 2008 may become a challenge to globalisation .
First find $ 700 m
Rich countries need to take the food problems as seriously as they take the credit crunch .
Already bigwigs at the World Bank and the United Nations are calling for a “ new deal ” for food .
Their clamour is justified .
But getting the right kind of help is not so easy , partly because food is not a one - solution - fits - all problem and partly because some of the help needed now risks making matters worse in the long run .
The starting - point should be that rising food prices bear more heavily on some places than others .
Food exporters , and countries where farmers are self - sufficient , or net sellers , benefit .
Some countries — those in West Africa which import their staples , or Bangladesh , with its huge numbers of landless labourers — risk ruin and civil strife .
Because of the severity there , the first step must be to mend the holes in the world 's safety net .
That means financing the World Food Programme properly .
The WFP is the world 's largest distributor of food aid and its most important barrier between hungry people and starvation .
Like a $ 1 - a - day family in a developing country , its purchasing power has been slashed by the rising cost of grain .
Merely to distribute the same amount of food as last year , the WFP needs — and should get — an extra $ 700 m .
And because the problems in many places are not like those of a traditional famine , the WFP should be allowed to broaden what it does .
At the moment , it mostly buys grain and doles it out in areas where there is little or no food .
That is necessary in famine - ravaged places , but it damages local markets .
In most places there are no absolute shortages and the task is to lower domestic prices without doing too much harm to farmers .
That is best done by distributing cash , not food — by supporting ( sometimes inventing ) social - protection programmes and food - for - work schemes for the poor .
The agency can help here , though the main burden — tens of billions of dollars ' worth — will be borne by developing - country governments and lending institutions in the West .
Such actions are palliatives .
But the food crisis of 2008 has revealed market failures at every link of the food chain ( see article ) .
Any “ new deal ” ought to try to address the long - term problems that are holding poor farmers back .
Then stop the distortions
In general , governments ought to liberalise markets , not intervene in them further .
Food is riddled with state intervention at every turn , from subsidies to millers for cheap bread to bribes for farmers to leave land fallow .
The upshot of such quotas , subsidies and controls is to dump all the imbalances that in another business might be smoothed out through small adjustments onto the one unregulated part of the food chain : the international market .
For decades , this produced low world prices and disincentives to poor farmers .
Now , the opposite is happening .
As a result of yet another government distortion — this time subsidies to biofuels in the rich world — prices have gone through the roof .
Governments have further exaggerated the problem by imposing export quotas and trade restrictions , raising prices again .
In the past , the main argument for liberalising farming was that it would raise food prices and boost returns to farmers .
Now that prices have massively overshot , the argument stands for the opposite reason : liberalisation would reduce prices , while leaving farmers with a decent living .
There is an occasional exception to the rule that governments should keep out of agriculture .
They can provide basic technology : executing capital - intensive irrigation projects too large for poor individual farmers to undertake , or paying for basic science that helps produce higher - yielding seeds .
But be careful .
Too often — as in Europe , where superstitious distrust of genetic modification is slowing take - up of the technology — governments hinder rather than help such advances .
Since the way to feed the world is not to bring more land under cultivation , but to increase yields , science is crucial .
Agriculture is now in limbo .
The world of cheap food has gone .
With luck and good policy , there will be a new equilibrium .
The transition from one to the other is proving more costly and painful than anyone had expected .
But the change is desirable , and governments should be seeking to ease the pain of transition , not to stop the process itself .

John McCain is apparently getting frustrated trying to defend the base political pander he calls the gas tax holiday .
( Typical appraisal from those in the know : “ It ’s about the dumbest thing I ’ve heard in an awful long time from an economic point of view . ” — Michael Bloomberg )
Here ’s McCain responding to a voter ’s question :
“ You ’d think that I was attacking Western civilization as we know it .
The special interests [ say ] , ‘ Oh , my God .
This will destroy our transportation system in America .
This will have disastrous consequences . ’
Look , all I think is we ought to give low - income Americans , in particular , a little relief . ”
Okay , first of all , to suggest that opponents of the gas tax holiday are “ special interests ” is preposterous .
Experts and economists of all ideological types have criticized the gas tax holiday as braindead .
Second , the special interests , specifically the oil companies , are cheering the idea .
If you take an 18 - cent tax off the price of a gallon of gas , you allow the oil companies to add 18 cents per gallon in additional profits .
That ’s why the original criticisms of the McCain version of the gas tax called it a giveaway to the oil companies !
And one other note .
John McCain seems to think that the gas tax holiday helps low - income Americans the most because they drive the farthest .
In fact , the opposite is true .
Lorri L. Jean ( L ) and Gina Calvelli ( R ) share a piece of wedding cake at a demonstration celebrating the California Supreme Court 's decision overturning a ban on same - sex marriages held in West Hollywood , California on May 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Phil McCarten
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A majority of registered Californian voters oppose changing the constitution of the most populous U.S. state to bar gays from marrying , according to poll released on Wednesday .
The Field Poll survey found 51 percent against approving a possible November ballot measure to prohibit gay marriage , with 43 percent in favor .
A slightly differently worded question on the same issue found 54 percent opposed and 40 percent in favor .
The poll follows a state Supreme Court decision this month that barring homosexuals from marrying violated the California Constitution .
Opponents of same - sex marriage have intensified efforts to put a state constitutional amendment on the ballot in November .
The poll found a strong generational gap on the issue , with those aged 18 - 29 approving of gay marriage by 68 percent and those 65 or older disapproving by 55 percent .
The poll found that in recent decades a growing number of Californians have approved allowing same - sex couples to marry , with 51 percent of those polled now approving , up from 44 percent in 2006 and 30 percent in 1985 .
The poll of 1,052 registered Californian voters was taken from May 17 - 26 , in the days after California Supreme Court decision , and had a sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points to 5 percentage points , depending on the question .
I am hardly the world 's best programmer .
I 'll be the first to tell you that there are tons of developers out there better than I am .
But here 's the thing : in the ten years I 've been gainfully employed as a so - called professional programmer , I can count the number of truly great programmers I 've worked with on one hand .
I know this probably sounds like hopeless elitism , but hear me out : there 's something unique about our profession that leads to an unusually profound disparity in skill .
In programming specifically , many studies have shown order of magnitude differences in the quality of the programs written , the sizes of the programs written , and the productivity of the programmers .
The original study that showed huge variations in individual programming productivity was conducted in the late 1960s by Sackman , Erikson , and Grant ( 1968 ) .
They studied professional programmers with an average of 7 years ' experience and found that the ratio of intitial coding time between the best and worst programmers was about 20:1 ; the ratio of debugging times over 25:1 ; of program sizes 5:1 ; and of program execution speed about 10:1 .
They found no relationship between a programmer 's amount of experience and code quality or productivity .
( Code Complete , page 548 )
In other words , the good developers aregood , and the bad developers are atrociously bad .
You really never know what you 're going to get when you arrive on a job : statistically , you 've got a fifty / fifty chance of working with either a genius or a jackass .
Is n't that reassuring ?
Would n't you expect a truck driver with twenty years of driving experience to perform better than a rookie with less than a year of road time under his belt ?
Of course you would .
And should n't a grizzled ten year veteran of dozens of software projects -- like , say , myself -- perform better than some punk kid directly out of college ?
Well , you might think so , but in the bizarro world of software development , that logic does n't apply :
[ In the analysis of Coding War Games results , 1977 - 1986 , we found that ] people who had ten years of experience did not outperform those with two years of experience .
There was no correlation between experience and performance except that those with less than six months ' experience with the languages used in the exercise did not do as well as the rest of the sample .
( Peopleware , p. 47 )
In a study with similar findings , Bill Curtis presented a group of 60 professional programmers with what he characterized as a " simple " debugging task ( " Substantiating Programmer Variability , " Proceedings of the IEEE , vol. 69 , no. 7 , 1981 ) .
In spite of its simplicity , 6 of the professional programmers were n't able to complete the task , and data on their performance was excluded from the results of the study .
Curtis observed order of magnitude differences among the programmers who were able to complete the task .
( Steve McConnell )
What the hell kind of profession generates so much data supporting the hypothesis that there is no correlation between experience , performance , and skill ?
Where do we go from there ?
I do n't have any answers , but I do have two suggestions .
A Mentor teacher was arrested Wednesday and charged with sexual battery for having a sexual relationship with a 15 - year - old Shore Junior High student at the school , police said .
Maggie Laughlin , 23 , of Willowick , was arrested at her home Wednesday night .
She was to be arraigned Thursday morning in Mentor Municipal Court on charges of sexual battery , a third degree felony , and unlawful sexual conduct with a minor .

DIGG THIS
When President Bush , before the Knesset , used the word “ appeasement ” to label those who would negotiate with Iran ’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , he invoked the most powerful analogy in any debate over war and peace .
No man wishes to be regarded as an “ appeaser . ”
But , as this writer has discovered since my book Churchill , Hitler and The Unnecessary War : How Britain Lost Its Empire and the West Lost the World was launched Memorial Day , there is a deep well of ignorance about what happened that September , 70 years ago .
Why did Neville Chamberlain go to Munich ?
How did Munich lead to World War II ?
The seeds of the crisis were planted at the Paris peace conference of 1919 .
There , the victorious Allies carved the new nation of Czechoslovakia out of the Austro - Hungarian Empire .
But instead of following their principle of self - determination , the Allies placed under the rule of 7 million Czechs 3 million Germans , 3 million Slovaks , 800,000 Hungarians , 150,000 Poles and 500,000 Ruthenians .
These foolish decisions spat upon Woodrow Wilson ’s 14 Points , under the terms of which the Germans , Austrians and Hungarians had laid down their arms .
By 1938 , Germany had arisen , re-armed and brought Austria into the Reich , and was demanding the right of self - determination now be granted to the 3 million Germans in Czechoslovakia , who were clamoring to be free of Prague to rejoin their kinsmen .
Britain had no alliance with , and no obligation to fight for , the Czechs .
But France did .
And Britain feared that if Adolf Hitler used force to bring the Sudeten Germans back to German rule , France might fight .
And if France declared war , Britain would be drawn in , and a second bloodbath would ensue as it had in 1914 .
Chamberlain went to Munich because he did not believe that keeping 3 million Germans inside a nation to which they had been consigned against their will was worth a world war .
Moreover , Britain was unprepared for war .
She had no draft , no Spitfires , no divisions ready to be sent to France .
Why should the British Empire commit suicide by declaring war on Germany , to support a Paris peace agreement that he , Chamberlain , believed had been unjustly and dishonorably imposed on a defeated Germany ?
Chamberlain believed not — and , after three trips to Germany that September , he effected the transfer of the Sudeten Germans to Berlin ’s rule , where they wished to be .
He came home in triumph to be hailed as the greatest peacemaker of all time .
Why , then , are “ Munich ” and “ appeasement ” terms of obloquy ?
The answer lies in what happened next .
Chamberlain returned from Munich to a rapturous reception , waving a paper he and Hitler had signed , and declared : “ For the second time in 60 years , a British prime minister has returned from Germany with peace with honor .
I believe it is peace for our time . ”
This was palpable nonsense .
Hitler had already turned to the next item on his menu , Danzig , a city of 350,000 Germans , detached from the Reich at Versailles and made a Free City to give the new Poland an outlet to the sea .
Hitler did not want war with Poland .
Indeed , he wanted the kind of alliance with Poland he had with Italy .
But , first , Danzig must be resolved .
Here , too , the British Government agreed : Danzig should be returned .
For of all the amputations of German lands and peoples at Versailles , European statesmen , even Winston Churchill , regarded Danzig and the Polish Corridor that sliced Germany in two as the most outrageous .
The problem was the Poles , who refused to discuss Danzig .
Then , in March , Czechoslovakia suddenly began to fall apart .
The Sudetenland had been annexed by Germany .
Hungary had taken back its lost lands , and Poland had annexed the disputed region of Teschen .
Slovakia and Ruthenia now moved to declare independence , and Prague began to march on the provinces .
Hitler intervened to guarantee the independence of Slovakia and gave Hungary a green light to re-annex Ruthenia .
Czech President Hacha then asked to see Hitler , who bullied him for three hours into signing away Czech sovereignty and making his nation the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia .
Chamberlain , now humiliated , mocked by Tory back - benchers , panicking over wild false rumors of German attacks on Romania and Poland , made the greatest blunder in British history .
Unasked , he issued a war guarantee to Poland , empowering a Polish dictatorship of colonels that had joined Hitler in dismembering Czechoslovakia to drag the British Empire into war with Germany over a city , Danzig , the British thought should be returned to Germany .
It was not Munich .
It was the war guarantee that guaranteed the war that brought down the Empire , and gave us the Holocaust , 50 million dead and the Stalinization of half of Europe .

The Best of Patrick J. Buchanan
North Carolina community colleges yesterday banned illegal immigrants from seeking degrees , creating a new policy that is among the most restrictive in the US .
Community college system President Scott Ralls said he based the decision on the advice of the state attorney general 's office , which said last week that federal law appears to ban states from enrolling illegal immigrants in state colleges and universities .
" We sought that advice and we plan to follow that advice until further clarification , " Ralls said of the attorney general 's guidance .
The decision takes effect immediately at the system 's 58 campuses and reverses a policy that allowed illegal immigrants , paying out - of - state tuition that more than covers the cost of instruction .
It comes despite the federal government 's assertion last week that it has no authority over admissions at North Carolina colleges and despite Governor Mike Easley 's request that the colleges remain open to all students .
Ralls said he will continue to seek clarification of federal law regarding the eligibility of illegal immigrants for post - secondary education and that another policy change is possible .
Ralls , who became president of the system this month , said this is the fourth time since 2001 that the system has changed its policy on illegal immigrants .
" It 's the issue of the day , " Ralls said .
" We 're trying to navigate our way as best we can . "
Several immigration law experts say they know of no state that bars illegal immigrants from attending public colleges and universities .
Officials in Easley 's office said last week that if the state 's colleges and universities followed the attorney general 's advice , North Carolina would be the only state to restrict admissions based on immigration status .
Easley asked the colleges to continue admitting students regardless of their immigration status .
Easley 's office released a brief statement about the community college decision yesterday : " It is odd the community colleges would ask for clarification on the law and then change the policy before they get the clarification . "
Undocumented students will still be allowed to enrol in non-degree programs , including general equivalency classes , English as a second language courses and classes for high school credit .
Of the 300,000 students enrolled in degree programs at the state 's community colleges , 112 are undocumented ; those students will be allowed to remain , the statement from the community colleges said .
The advice from the office of Attorney General Roy Cooper came in a May 6 advisory letter , which cited a federal law that deems illegal immigrants ineligible for public benefits including post - secondary education .
It said the department of homeland security was responsible for enforcing the law and described its interpretation as " unsettled " .
However , the letter recommended that the community colleges return to a 2001 policy that prohibited illegal immigrants .
Campuses had been allowed to set their own policies since 2004 , and about a third excluded illegal immigrants .
But in November , then - President Martin Lancaster required all schools to admit students regardless of immigration status .
The policy sparked so much controversy that the community college system asked Cooper 's office for an opinion .
The department of homeland security responded to the advice on Friday , saying it had no authority over admissions at North Carolina colleges .
On Tuesday , Cooper 's office said in a statement it was seeking more guidance from federal officials .
Spokeswoman Noelle Talley said that the community colleges ' 2001 policy had never received a legal challenge .
Cooper 's office sent its advice only to the community colleges , but it also applied to the state 's universities .
Yesterday , University of North Carolina System President Erskine Bowles sent a letter to the university chancellors and the board of governors .
It said that the UNC system would not change its policy of admitting illegal immigrants at out - of - state rates until it received further clarification of federal law .
" In this instance , there sure seems to be considerable legal disagreement about what the relevant federal law really says , " Bowles wrote .
The UNC system says that only 27 of its approximately 200,000 students are in the country illegally .
The community college decision yesterday drew the eyes of immigration activists around the country .
Several local and national groups celebrated the announcement , saying it would discourage illegal immigration .
" We 're delighted , " said Ron Woodard of Cary , head of the group NC Listen , which favours a crackdown on illegal immigration .
" If it 's illegal to be in the country , why would it be legal to go to college ? "
Advocates , however , said they were confounded and angry .
More than 80 North Carolina community groups , including Hispanic resource centres , religious groups and unions , announced their support yesterday for allowing illegal immigrants to attend college .
Tony Asion , director of the statewide Hispanic advocacy group El Pueblo , said he was confused by the decision in light of statements from federal officials .
" We 're forgetting that we 're talking about people 's lives here , " Asion said .
" Some of these young people , if you picked them up and took them back to their home country , they would be completely out of place .
They 're steeped in American culture .
But we 're telling them , ' We do n't really want you here . ' "
Meanwhile , the campuses were scrambling to change their admissions policies , some of them for the second time in six months .
Jerri Haigler , a spokeswoman for Central Piedmont community college , said the school was still awaiting guidance on how it should screen new applicants .
Stephen Scott , president at Wake Technical community college , said another policy change will require another round of staff training .
" There 's much controversy around the issue so it's not a surprise , " Scott said of the decision .
" Our role is to educate students , and we will follow the rules set down for us . "
Brighton Kemptown MP
Des Turner has called for hard drugs to be legalised .
The Labour MP spoke out after an investigation by The Argus lifted the lid on street dealing in Brighton and Hove .
Reporter Andy
Whelan bought heroin from a man in one of Hove 's main shopping streets .
And it took him just 26 minutes to obtain the drug .
Dr Turner 's comments come after details of yet another young victim of the city 's heroin trade were revealed .
An inquest into the death of Tania Meires heard that heroin in Brighton was so pure that injecting it was like " playing Russian roulette every time " .
Dr Turner said it was now time to decriminalise drug use and supply the substances over the counter in a regulated way .
In what is certain to cause a storm of controversy , the MP said : " The policy we have at the moment of criminalising drugs obviously is n't working .
" We need some fresh alternative thinking if we are to get a grip on the problem .
" I would rather we decriminalise drug use and supply people who are unfortunate enough to be drug addicts from our own pharmacies which we know to be safe . "
From 2002 to 2005 Brighton and Hove was named the drugs - death capital of Britain by the International Centre for Drug Policy at the University of London .
In 2006 it came second to Blackpool .
Mr Turner wants to see drugs prescribed to wipe out the multimillion - pound criminal trade in which dealers determine the quality of the substances .
He said : " I do n't think there is one single magical solution but the current policy does n't actually reduce the scale of the problem .
It needs some quality control to get the bad drugs off the streets .
" We really need to focus heavily on the suppliers .
I have never said this on the public record before because it is kind of contentious .
" People immediately will accuse me of being soft on drugs , which I 'm not .
It is a view I have reluctantly come to because the policies are n't working .
" I would like to emphasise this is a view that has been put forward by several senior policemen in the country . "
Last night , a senior Sussex Police officer welcomed a renewed debate on drug laws .
Brighton and Hove city commander Chief Supt Paul Pearce said : " The use of controlled drugs is an issue that is important because it impacts adversely on so many areas of society .
The story in The Argus yesterday about how easy it is to buy heroin in the city shows just how big an issue this is for Brighton and Hove .
" The police service seeks to encourage an open and honest debate on the use of controlled drugs and that debate must be informed by the harm caused not only to users , but also to others who become victims either directly or indirectly .
" It is worthy of the widest debate but it often seems that it is easier and more convenient to get sidetracked by details such as whether cannabis should be a Class B or C drug . "
Last year North Wales Police Chief Constable Richard Brunstrom spoke openly about his desire to see drugs legalised .
He said the current policy was creating crime due to the massive illegal profits that can be made and was putting vulnerable people in danger .
He said : " I do n't advocate anybody abusing their body with drugs but clearly some want to .
" What would be wrong with making heroin available on the state for people who wanted to abuse their bodies ?
What is wrong with that ? "
Around the same time David Lepper , Labour MP for Brighton Pavilion , called for heroin addicts to be given the drug to stop them committing crime .
Home Office research has found that each heroin addict commits an average of 432 crimes a year and each addict 's yearly crime spree costs an average £ 45,000 .
He said : " If it was part of a carefully controlled scheme with carefully chosen clients then it would be good to try it to see if it does help to get people off drugs and help reduce crime . "
Charity DrugScope said : " DrugScope fully supports the principle of removing drug users from the criminal justice system where appropriate and ensuring they receive effective and appropriate treatment . "
A Home Office spokeswoman said : " We do not accept that legalisation and regulation is now , or will be in the future , an acceptable response to the presence of drugs "
Clean Tech of the Week : Wash Clothes Without Water
June 16th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Not exactly washing without water , but with less than 2 % of a normal washing machine .
That ’s only 1 cup of water for those sweaty gym clothes , grubby kid-wear , and foul socks .
Washing with soap and water has been THE WAY to clean most clothes for so long , it ’s hard to imagine reducing H2O by 98 % .
What this technology lacks in sexy bells and whistles , it gains in implications .
Billions of gallons of clean water could be conserved every year simply by adopting this dry cleaning technology .
Less water also means less drying , which can add energy savings to those with energy - hungry clothes dryers .
The process uses plastic granules , which tumble with your laundry and a little water and detergent .
The plastic absorbs the dirt or grit and can be reused for up to six months .
“ A range of tests , carried out according to worldwide industry protocols to prove the technology performs to the high standards expected in the cleaning industry , show the process can remove virtually all types of everyday stains as effectively as existing processes whilst leaving clothes as fresh as normal washing .
In addition , the clothes emerge from the process almost dry , reducing the need for tumble - dryers . ” ( Source )
The company bent on developing this technology is called Xeros , which started out of the UK ’s University of Leeds School of Design .
Professor Stephen Burkinshaw is the founder of Xeros , and hopes to use £ 500,000 in funding to bring a product to market as soon as 2009 .
Dry cleaning companies have already shown interest in the technology , especially in areas with growing concerns over solvents involved in some dry cleaning techniques .
Let ’s hope this technology is affordable and spreads like wildfire .

Hillary Clinton Did n’t Pay Health Care Premiums For Her Campaign Staff
Hillary Clinton believes that all Americans have the right to health care .
She has vowed to make all of us working stiffs pay for the health care of those who either do not want it or ca n’t afford it .
Personally , I can think of better ways to use the money Hillary is going to take away from me to provide health care for someone I do n’t know .
I would like to make further provisions for MY family rather than have the government force me to provide for someone else ’s family .
It is not my responsibility to provide for other people ’s families , it is their responsibility to provide for themselves .
Hillary has no problem spending other people ’s money , she just has a little problem spending her own .
The woman who wants us to provide all Americans with health care does n’t have the same desire for herself .
Hillary Clinton has left the health care premiums for her campaign staff unpaid .
Among the debts reported this month by Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s struggling presidential campaign , the $ 292,000 in unpaid health insurance premiums for her campaign staff stands out .
This is just too ironic , is n’t it .
The excuse of her campaign not having enough money to pay for health care rings hollow if you ask me .
It rings hollow to me because Democrats keep reminding us that the economy is bad .
They keep reminding us that the middle class is being squeezed , and that Americans are not as well of as they were in the 1990’s .
In spite of all of these struggles the middle class supposedly has , we will still be expected to pick up the health care costs of the uninsured through more taxes .
Putting a further burden on the class that Democrats say is already stretched to the limits .
So I do n’t want to hear that the Clinton campaign ca n’t afford to pay for health care for others .
That excuse will not work for middle class families when their paycheck takes a hit in order to fund health care , and it should not work for Hillary either .
The risks associated with the vast , unregulated market for credit default swaps played a crucial role in the bailout of Bear Stearns .
Now these financial instruments are taking center stage in another Wall Street drama : whether regulators will let MBIA , the big bond insurance company , renege on a promise to shore up a crucial unit with $ 900 million in capital .
MBIA has written $ 137 billion in swaps , which are privately traded insurance contracts that let people bet on companies ’ financial health .
Most of these contracts stipulate that if MBIA ’s bond insurance unit becomes insolvent or is taken over by state regulators , buyers can demand payment immediately .
But if that were to happen , MBIA would have far less money to pay policyholders and owners of municipal bonds backed by the company .
So the swaps give MBIA significant leverage over Eric R. Dinallo , the commissioner of the New York State insurance department , who wanted the company to bolster its insurance unit with the $ 900 million in cash .
In the case of Bear Stearns , the Federal Reserve feared that credit default swaps might unleash a chain reaction of losses if the bank were allowed to collapse .
Given the threat that similar swaps may pose to MBIA , Mr. Dinallo is unlikely to push for a regulatory takeover of the subsidiary even if Joseph W. Brown , MBIA ’s chief executive , refuses to recapitalize the unit .
WSJ : Doing Hard Time
In Greenland Is n't Really That Hard
Mr. Lindenhann is serving a life sentence for three rapes .
But like other hard - core inmates at the only jail in this island 's tiny capital , he enjoys some extraordinary privileges , including unaccompanied shopping trips .
Though some residents know of his crimes , they look the other way .
" He 's sweet , " said the store owner , as she waved goodbye to him .
The jail has no fences and no bars , but plenty of television sets , DVD players and computers .
Inmates hold regular jobs around town , earning about $ 2,800 a month , a living wage in this country of 53,000 people .
In the summer they 're given shotguns and allowed to hunt reindeer and seals .
The only requirement for such hunting trips :
They must be accompanied by armed guards , says Soeren Soedergaard Hansen , chief judge of Greenland .
" And they can not be drunk . "
About this post
This post presents a practical , compact example which demonstrates a use case for both infinite lookahead and Ruby Slippers parsing .
While the example itself is very simple , this post may not be a good first tutorial -- it focuses on Marpa implementation strategy , instead of basics .
About Urbit
The example described in this post is one part of hoonlint .
hoonlint , currently under development , will be a " lint " program for a language called Hoon .
Hoon is part of the Urbit project .
Urbit is an effort to return control of the Internet experience to the individual user .
( The Urbit community has , generously , been supporting my work on Hoon . )
The original Internet and its predecessors were cosy places .
Users controlled their experience .
Authority was so light you could forget it was there , but so adequate to its task that you could forget why it was necessary .
What we old timers do remember of the early Internet was the feeling of entering into a " brave new world " .
The Internet grew beyond our imaginings , and our pure wonder of decades ago now seems ridiculous .
But the price has been a shift of power which should be no laughing matter .
Control of our Internet experience now resides in servers , run by entities which make no secret of having their own interests .
Less overt , but increasingly obvious , is the single - mindedness with which they pursue those interests .
And the stakes have risen .
In the early days , we used the Internet as a supplement in our intellectual lives .
Today , we depend on it in our financial and social lives .
Today , the server - sphere can be a hostile place .
Going forward it may well become a theater of war .
We could try to solve this problem by running our own servers .
But this is a lot of work , and only leaves us in touch with those willing and able to do that .
In practice , this seems to be nobody .
Urbit seeks to solve these problems with hassle - free personal servers , called urbits .
Urbits are journaling databases , so they are incorruptable .
To make sure they can be run anywhere in the cloud , they are based on a tiny virtual machine , called Nock .
To keep urbits compact and secure , Urbit takes on code bloat directly -- Urbit is an original design from a clean slate , with a new protocol stack .
About Hoon
Nock 's " machine language " takes the form of trees of arbitrary precision integers .
The integers can be interpreted as strings , floats , etc. , as desired .
And the trees can be interpreted as lists , giving Nock a resemblance to a LISP VM .
Nock does its own memory management and takes care of its own garbage collection .
Traditionally , there are two ways to enter machine language ,
Physically , for example , by toggling it into a machine 's front panel .
Originally , entering it physically was the only way .
Indirectly , using assembler or some higher - level language , like C . Once these indirect methods existed , they rapidly took over as the most common way to create machine language .
Like traditional machine language , Nock can not be written directly .
Hoon is Urbit 's equivalent of C -- it is Urbit 's " close to the metal " higher level language .
Not that Hoon looks much like C , or anything else you 've ever seen .
This is a Hoon program that takes an integer argument , call it n , and returns the first n counting numbers :
|= end=@ :: 1 =/ count=@ 1 :: 2 |- :: 3 ^- ( list @ ) :: 4 ? : =( end count ) :: 5 ~ :: 6 :- count :: 7 $ ( count ( add 1 count ) ) :: 8
Hoon comments begin with a " :: " and run until the next newline .
The above Hoon sample uses comments to show line numbers .
The example for this post will be a hoonlint subset : a multi-line comment linter .
Multi-line comments are the only Hoon syntax we will talk about .
( For those who want to know more about Hoon , there is a tutorial . )
About Hoon comments
In basic Hoon syntax , multi-line comments are free - form .
In practice , Hoon authors tend to follow a set of conventions .
Pre-comments
In the simplest case , a comment must precede the code it describes , and be at the same indent .
These simple cases are called " pre-comments " .
For example , this code contains a pre-comment :
:: pre-comment 1 [ 20 ( mug bod ) ]
Inter - comments
:~
: ~ [ 3 7 ] :: :: pre-comment 1 [ 20 ( mug bod ) ] :: :: pre-comment 2 [ 2 yax ] :: :: pre-comment 3 [ 2 qax ] :::: :: :: pre-comment 4 :: [ 4 qax ] :: :: pre-comment 5 [ 5 tay ] ==
Hoon multi-line comments may also contain " inter - comments " .
The inter-comments are aligned depending on the syntax .
In the display below , the inter -comments are aligned with the " rune " of the enclosing sequence .
A " rune " is Hoon 's rough equivalent of a " keyword " .
Runes are always digraphs of special ASCII characters .
The rune in the following code is , and the sequence it introduces includes pre-comments , inter-comments and meta-comments .
When inter-comments are empty , as they are in the above , they are called " breathing comments " , because they serve to separate , or allow some " air " between , elements of a sequence .
For clarity , the pre-comments in the above are further indicated : all and only pre-comments contain the text " pre-comment " .
Meta-comments
The above code also contains a third kind of comment -- meta-comments .
Meta -comments must occur at the far left margin -- at column 1 .
These are called meta-comments , because they are allowed to be outside the syntax structure .
One common use for meta - comments is " commenting out " other syntax .
In the above display , the meta - comments " comment out " the comment labeled " pre-comment 4 " and its associated code .
Staircase comments
Finally , there are " staircase comments " , which are used to indicate the larger structure of Hoon sequences and other code .
For example ,
: : :: :::: 3e : AES encryption ( XX removed ) :: :: :: :: :: :: :::: 3f : scrambling :: :: :: :: ob :: ::
Each staircase consists of three parts .
In lexical order , these parts are an upper riser , a tread , and a lower riser .
The upper riser is a sequence of comments at the same alignment as an inter-comment .
The tread is also at the inter - comment alignment , but must be 4 colons ( " :::: " ) followed by whitespace .
The lower riser is a sequence of comments indented two spaces more than the tread .
Hoon comment conventions
Hoon 's basic syntax allows comments to be free - form .
In practice , there are strict conventions for these comments , conventions we would like to enforce with hoonlint .
A multi-line comment may contain an " inter - part " , a " pre-part " , or both .
If both an inter -part and a pre-part are present , the inter - part must precede the pre-part .
The inter - part is a non-empty sequence of inter-comments and staircases .
A pre-part is a non-empty sequence of pre-comments .
Meta -comments may be inserted anywhere in either the pre-part or the inter -part .
Comments which do not obey the above rules are bad comments .
A good comment is any comment which is not a bad comment .
A comment is not regarded as a meta - comment if it can be parsed as structural comment .
An structural comment is any good comment which is not a meta - comment .
Grammar
We will implement these conventions using the BNF of this section .
The sections to follow outline the strategy behind the BNF .

Technique : Combinator
hoonlint
Our comment linter is implemented as a combinator .
The mainparser invokes this combinator when it encounters a multi-line comment .
Because of the main parser , we do not have to worry about confusing comments with Hoon 's various string and in - line text syntaxes .
Note that while combinator parsing is useful , it is a technique that can be oversold .
Combinators have been much talked about in the functional programming literature , but the current flagship functional programming language compiler , the Glasgow Haskell Compiler , does not use combinators to parse its version of the Haskell -- instead it uses a parser in the yacc lineage .
As a parsing technique on its own , the use of combinators is simply another way of packaging recursive descent with backtracking , and the two techniques share the same power , the same performance , and the same downsides .
Marpa is much more powerful than either LALR ( yacc - lineage ) parsers or combinators , so we can save combinator parsing for those cases where combinator parsing really is helpful .
One such case is lexer mismatch .
Lexer mismatch
The first programming languages , like BASIC and FORTRAN , were line - structured -- designed to be parsed line - by - line .
After ALGOL , new languages were usually block - structured .
Blocks can start or end in the middle of a line , and can span multiple lines .
And blocks are often nested .
A line - structured language requires its lexer to think in terms of lines , but this approach is completely useless for a block - structured language .
Combining both line - structured and block - structured logic in the same lexer usually turns the lexer 's code into a rat 's nest .
Calling a combinator every time a line - structured block is encountered eliminates the problem .
The main lexer can assume that the code is block - structured , and all the line - by - line logic can go into combinators .
Technique : Non-determinism
Our grammar is non-deterministic , but unambiguous .
It is unambiguous because , for every input , it will produce no more than one parse .
It is non-deterministic because there is a case where it tracks two possible parses at once .
The comment linter cannot immediately distinguish between a prefix of the upper riser of a staircase , and a prefix of a sequence of inter-comments .
When a tread and lower riser is encountered , the parser knows it has found a staircase , but not until then .
And if the parse is of an inter -comment sequence , the comment linter will not be sure of this until the end of the sequence .
Technique : Infinite lookahead
As just pointed out , the comment linter does not know whether it is parsing a staircase or an inter-comment sequence until either
it finds a tread and lower riser , in which case it knows the correct parse will be a staircase ; or
it successfully reaches the end of the inter - comment sequence , in which case it knows the correct parse is an inter-comment sequence .
To determine which of these two choices is the correct parse , the linter needs to read an arbitrarily long sequence of tokens -- in other words , the linter needs to perform infinite lookahead .
Humans deal with infinite lookaheads all the time -- natural languages are full of situations that require them .
Modern language designers labor to avoid the need for infinite lookahead , but even so cases where it is desirable pop up .
Fortunately , in 1991 , Joop Leo published a method that allows computers to emulate infinite lookahead efficiently .
Marpa uses Joop 's technique .
Joop 's algorithm is complex , but the basic idea is to do what humans do in the same circumstance -- keep all the possibilities in mind until the evidence comes in .
Technique : the Ruby Slippers
Recall that , according to our conventions , our parser does not recognize a meta - comment unless no structural comment can be recognized .
We could implement this in BNF , but it is much more elegant to use the Ruby Slippers .
As those already familiar with Marpa may recall , the Ruby Slippers are invoked when a Marpa parser finds itself unable to proceed with its current set of input tokens .
At this point , the lexer can ask the Marpa parser what token it does want .
Once the lexer is told what the " wished - for " token is , it can concoct one , out of nowhere if necessary , and pass it to the Marpa parser , which then proceeds happily .
In effect , the lexer acts like Glenda the Good Witch of Oz , while the Marpa parser plays the role of Dorothy .
In our implementation , the Marpa parser , by default , looks only for structural comments .
If the Marpa parser of our comment linter finds that the current input line is not a structural comment , the Marpa parser halts and tells the lexer that there is a problem .
The lexer then asks the Marpa parser what it is looking for .
In this case , the answer will always be the same : the Marpa parser will be looking for a meta - comment .
The lexer checks to see if the current line is a comment starting at column 1 .
If there is a comment starting at column 1 , the lexer tells the Marpa parser that its wish has come true -- there is a meta - comment .
Another way to view the Ruby Slippers is as a kind of exception mechanism for grammars .
In this application , we treat inability to read an structural comment as an exception .
When the exception occurs , if possible , we read a meta - comment .
Technique : Error Tokens
Error tokens are a specialized use of the Ruby Slippers .
The application for this parser is " linting " -- checking that the comments follow conventions .
As such , the main product of the parser is not the parse -- it is the list of errors gathered along the way .
So stopping the parser at the first error does not make sense .
What is desirable is to treat all inputs as valid , so that the parsing always runs to the end of input , in the process producing a list of the errors .
To do this , we want to set up the parser so that it reads special " error tokens " whenever it encounters a reportable error .
This is perfect for the Ruby Slippers .
If an " exception " occurs , as above described for meta - comments , but no meta - comment is available , we treat it as a second level exception .
When would no meta - comment be available ?
There are two cases :
The line read is a comment , but it does not start at column 1 .
The line read is a blank line ( all whitespace ) .
On the second exception level , the current line will be read as either a < BlankLine > , or a < BadComment > .
We know that every line must lex as either a < BlankLine > or a < BadComment > because our comment linter is called as a combinator , and the parent Marpa parser guarantees this .
Technique : Ambiguity
Marpa allows ambiguity , which could have been exploited as a technique .
For example , in a simpler BNF than that we used above , it might be ambiguous whether a meta - comment belongs to an < InterPart > which immediately precedes it ; or to a < PrePart > which immediately follows it .
We could solve the dilemma by noting that it does not matter :
All we care about is spotting bad comments and blank lines , so that picking one of two ambiguous parses at random will work fine .
But efficiency issues are sometimes a problem with ambiguity and unambiguity can be a good way of avoiding them .
Also , requiring the grammar to be unambiguous allows an additional check that is useful in the development phase .
In our code we test each parse for ambiguity .
If we find one , we know that hoonlint has a coding error .
Keeping the parser unambiguous makes the BNF less elegant than it could be .
To avoid ambiguity , we introduced extra symbols ; introduced extra rules ; and restricted the use of ambiguous tokens .
Recall that I am using the term " ambiguous " in the strict technical sense that it has in parsing theory , so that a parser is only ambiguous if it can produce two valid parses for one string .
An unambiguous parser can allow non-deterministism and can have ambiguous tokens .
In fact , our example grammar does both of these things , but is nonetheless unambiguous .
Extra symbols
< ProperPreComment >
< ProperPreComment >
< PrePart >
One example of an extra symbol introduced to make this parser unambiguous isis used to ensure that anever begins with a meta - comment .
The BNF requires that the first line of a < PrePart > must be a < ProperPreComment > .
This means that , if a < MetaComment > is found at the boundary between an < InterPart > and a < PrePart > , it can not be the first line of the < PrePart > and so must be the last line of the < InterPart > .
Extra rules
In our informal explanation of the comment conventions , we stated that an inter - part is a sequence , each element of which is an inter-comment or a staircase .
While BNF that directly implemented this rule would be correct , it would also be highly ambiguous :
If an inter -comment occurs before a tread or an upper riser line , it could also be parsed as part of the upper riser .
To eliminate the ambiguity , we stipulate that if comment can be parsed as part of a staircase , then it must be parsed as part of a staircase .
This stipulation still leaves the grammar non-deterministic -- we may not know if our comment could be part of a staircase until many lines later .
With our stipulation we know that , if an < InterComponent > contains a staircase , then that staircase must come before any of the inter-comments .
In an < InterComponent > both staircases and inter-comments are optional , so the unambiguous representation of < InterComponent > is
InterComponent ::= Staircases InterComponent ::= Staircases InterComments InterComponent ::= InterComments
< InterComponent >
Ambiguous tokens
Notice that , although both staircases and inter-comments are optional , we do not include the case where both are omitted .
This is because we insist that ancontain at least one line .
Our parser is not ambiguous , but it does allow ambiguous tokens .
For example , a comment with inter-comment alignment could be either an < InterComment > or an < UpperRiser > ; and our lexer returns both .
The parser remains unambiguous , however , because only one of these two tokens will wind up in the final parse .
Call the set of tokens returned by our parser for a single line , a " token set " .
If the token set contains more than one token , the tokenization is ambiguous for that line .
If the token set contains only one token , the token set is called a " singleton " , and tokenization is unambiguous for that line .
To keep this parser unambiguous , we restrict the ambiguity at the lexer level .
For example , our lexer is set up so that a meta - comment is never one of the alternatives in a lexical ambiguity .
If a token set contains a < MetaComment > , that token set must be a singleton .
The Ruby Slippers are used to enforce this .
Similarly , the Ruby Slippers are used to guarantee that any set of tokens containing either a < BadComment > or a < BlankLine > is a singleton .

Footnotes
This much is certain :
On the morning of November 27 , 1989 , Avianca Airlines Flight 203 took off from Bogotá , Colombia , headed for the city of Cali .
The Cali run is a journey of a few hundred miles over mountainous terrain , requiring less than an hour in the air .
Flight 203 lasted fewer than six minutes .
According to the black box found in the wreckage , Flight 203 had reached an altitude of 13,000 feet when the first explosion ripped through the cabin .
Eyewitnesses on the ground saw fire shooting out of the right side of the plane .
A few seconds later , a second explosion blew the plane apart , killing 101 passengers and six crew members .
Body parts , luggage and pieces of fuselage scattered across three miles of hillsides , killing another three people on the ground who happened to be in the path of the wreckage .
Nine days after the Avianca blast , a schoolbus packed with a ton of dynamite blew up outside the Bogotá headquarters of the Department of Administrative Security , or DAS , Colombia 's equivalent of the FBI .
The explosion killed dozens outright -- within a few weeks , the body count soared to more than seventy people -- and injured hundreds more .
Many of the victims were children playing in a daycare center in the building .
Among the drug warriors in Colombia and the United States , there was no doubt about who was responsible for the Avianca and DAS bombings .
Such grandiose acts of terror bore the stamp of Pablo Escobar , lord of the Medellín cartel , whose struggle to hold onto his vast cocaine empire had plunged his country into a ghastly spiral of extortion , corruption , assassination and mass murder .
Only Escobar was ruthless enough to order the wholesale slaughter of innocents just to eliminate a single enemy , a police chief or an informant .
But when it came to figuring out who had actually executed the orders , who had planted the bombs and why , the Colombian and American governments disagreed .
They still do .
The American theory , as it developed over the next five years , would focus on one man , Dandenis Muñoz Mosquera .
According to intelligence reports , Muñoz Mosquera had started working for Escobar at the age of twelve and made his way through Medellín 's legions of killers to the top of the heap .
The United States government would link him to the deaths of more than 220 people , including the Avianca and DAS bombings , the murders of dozens of Colombian police officers and judges , and numerous political assassinations .
It was said that Muñoz Mosquera ran an " executioner 's camp " in Medellín that transformed poor teenagers into sicarios , professional hit men .
A DEA agent described him as the " Al Capone of the drug - murder circuit . "
There were people who claimed that he had skinned victims alive and even castrated some .
At the time of the Avianca bombing , he was 23 years old .
Among Escobar 's people , Muñoz Mosquera was known as La Quica , a feminine , innocent - sounding nickname dating back to his childhood resemblance to a favorite great - aunt .
But to the DEA he was a monster , a killing machine that must be stopped .
And the incineration of Flight 203 had given the U.S. Department of Justice a way to go after him -- not for 200 deaths , but for two .
Carlos Andres Escobí and Astrid del Pilar Gómez were both passengers on the doomed flight .
Both happened to be American citizens .
Several months ago , Westword requested an interview with Dandenis Muñoz Mosquera , now serving ten consecutive life sentences on charges of racketeering , conspiracy , drug trafficking and murder stemming from the bombing of Flight 203 .
Such requests take time to make their way through the screening process of the federal Bureau of Prisons , especially when the prisoner in question is housed at the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum , also known as ADX , the highest - security prison in the federal system .
Located just outside the town of Florence , ADX has been home to some of the most notorious murderers of our time , including Unabomber Ted Kaczynski , World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef -- and , before his trip to the Indiana death house , Timothy McVeigh .
All of them are pikers , if you compare their actions to the horrific crimes attributed to La Quica .
Yet few people outside of Colombia have ever heard of Muñoz Mosquera .
But among those who know his reputation , the mere mention of his name commands instant respect .
To speak with him required a translator , and the person approached for the job , a young man of Colombian heritage , knew instantly what was being asked of him .
" Is this the guy they call ' La Quica ' ? " he asked .
He was told yes , that is Muñoz Mosquera 's nickname .
" Oh , man , " he groaned .
" This guy is , like , the most dangerous man in the world . "
The most dangerous man in the world checks in at about five - eight , maybe 160 pounds .
He receives visitors from inside a cramped glass booth in the bowels of ADX .
At the supermax , prisoners spend an average of 22 hours a day locked down in cells not much larger than the glass booth .
Muñoz Mosquera was one of the first inmates shipped to ADX , shortly after it opened in 1994 .
So far , he 's spent a total of nine years in federal prisons .
The United States government expects him to be its guest for the rest of his natural life .
And nine lives after that .
La Quica does not care much for his ADX accommodations .
The small booth is just one of the many indignities he must bear .
His lawyer does not answer his letters .
The world has forgotten him .
And the Americans plan to keep him in a little box until he rots -- a harsher fate , surely , than the painless exit awaiting Timothy McVeigh .
" When I first went to prison , " he says , " I had a boy who was three and a girl who was four .
I can never see them .
They are now teenagers .
I would give my life for liberty . "
Liberty ?
For the worst mass murderer in any American prison ?
Ah , he says , but he is not the man the Americans say he is .
He did not do these things .
" I was accused in this country , not my own , " he says .
" They put fake witnesses on the stand , people I had never seen .
And these people testified that I had committed this terrible crime ... I had never seen these people before in my life . "
Of course , he adds , many criminals say they are innocent .
But his story is the truth , he insists .
It 's also more complicated than most , since it involves the often - strained relationship between the governments of Colombia and the U.S. over the escalating drug war , conflicting theories about motives and suspects , and the American obsession with bringing down Escobar and the people around him at all costs -- a resolve that led to the groundbreaking federal prosecution of La Quica for a crime that occurred in another country , thousands of miles away .
If he is guilty , he argues , why did his own government never prosecute him ?
Colombia has never charged him with many of the crimes he 's been accused of by the American prosecutors , including the Avianca bombing , the DAS bombing , the 1989 murder of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán and several other assassinations .
He has letters from various Colombian officials that suggest he is not even considered a suspect in these conspiracies , for which various other Escobar associates have been convicted or are still being pursued .
( Just last month , Colombian prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for a fugitive named Eugenio León García Jaramillo , for his alleged involvement in the DAS and Avianca cases . )
La Quica also has documents that indicate he was in prison at the time some of these killings took place .
" I was never in prison for terrorism .
I was never in prison for killing anybody , " he says .
" The Americans just wanted to use me to get to Escobar .
My country had the jurisdiction ; they made a lot of investigations .
You think if I was guilty of blowing up that airplane , they would n't want to prosecute me ?
The same thing with the DAS bombing .
Many people died .
I was never accused of it there -- just in this country . "
He speaks quickly , in a flat , emotionless whisper .
His arguments seem sensible -- and they would be , perhaps , if he was talking about any place but Colombia .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , Colombia 's justice system was on the brink of collapse .
Police and judges assigned to battle the cartels had three choices : a bribe , a bullet , or early retirement .
The prisons were less secure than the average American high school ; much to the embarrassment of the national police , Escobar continued to run his operation from lavish prison digs for thirteen months , then simply walked away before the government could transfer him to a less cozy penitentiary .
Muñoz Mosquera escaped from Colombian prisons twice , in 1988 and 1991 ; the first time , he was accompanied by his older brother Brance , who later became Escobar 's chief of security .
Still , Muñoz Mosquera has found support for his claims in unlikely places .
In April 1994 , on the eve of his first trial for the Avianca bombing , the federal judge overseeing the case received an urgent letter from Colombia 's attorney general informing him that Colombian prosecutors had no evidence linking Muñoz Mosquera to the attack and that another man had already confessed to the crime .
The trial lasted two months and ended with the jury deadlocked after more than a week of deliberation .
Five months later , after a second lengthy trial , La Quica was found guilty on all thirteen counts .
The case still troubles former FBI agent Fred Whitehurst , a bomb expert who maintains that the testimony concerning the explosives used in the Avianca bombing was terribly flawed .
Whitehurst was n't directly involved in building the prosecution , but his whistleblowing protests in the Muñoz Mosquera case and several other high - profile federal cases eventually triggered a wide - ranging investigation by the Justice Department 's Inspector General into allegations of tainted evidence and coverups in the FBI crime laboratory .
" The government was in kind of a pickle , " Whitehurst says now .
" Muñoz Mosquera had already notched his gun 53 times with the deaths of Colombian policemen .
He was an internationally known assassin .
That was what we were being told , okay ?
So how are you going to put him back on the street ?
They had to come up with some damned excuse . "
For Whitehurst , the key issue is n't whether Muñoz Mosquera is guilty or simply a convenient fall guy for Escobar .
The larger question is whether the United States broke the rules to convict him , as it has done in many other arenas of the drug war .
As detailed in Mark Bowden 's new book Killing Pablo , based on his series in the Philadelphia Inquirer last fall , the war on the Medellín cartel led to a number of questionable actions by American military and intelligence officials , including an uneasy alliance with paramilitary and vigilante groups within Colombia .
Whitehurst says the same philosophy of " ends justifying means " haunts the Muñoz Mosquera case .
" Are we losing the drug war so badly that people have decided the law does n't work in this circumstance ? " he asks .
" We 're at war , but we 're trying to use the mechanisms of justice .
What happens at the end of the fight , when you 've blown away your justice system ? "
In 1989 , Forbes magazine pegged Pablo Escobar as the seventh - richest man in the world , with an estimated wealth of $ 3 billion .
It was one of the bloodiest fortunes of modern times , a portfolio accumulated through murder and America 's boundless appetite for cocaine .
Despite his lingering image as the Robin Hood of the Medellín slums , using driblets of drug money to fund housing projects and soccer fields , there was nothing terribly romantic -- or subtle -- about Escobar 's business .
He consolidated his control of the worldwide cocaine trade by wiping out rivals and purging his own ranks of anyone suspected of holding back profits .
Then he declared war on the government , putting hefty bounties on police officials , magistrates who signed arrest warrants , even intransigent Supreme Court justices .
By the late 1980s , his cartel had become a kind of shadow government itself , forcing Colombia to rescind its extradition laws so that he and his captains could remain out of reach of any foreign power .
The same year he made the Forbes list , the year of the Avianca and DAS bombings , his organization was blamed for the assassination of three of the five candidates running for president .
At the core of Escobar 's marketing strategy were the sicarios , the career killers recruited from the streets of Medellín .
They reportedly numbered in the thousands ; many had started in their teens or even earlier , shooting cops or rival dealers from the back of speeding motorcycles for modest pay .
They sent an unmistakable message to the highest levels of Colombian society :
Life is cheap , cheaper than cocaine , so do n't mess with Pablo .
Muñoz Mosquera denies he was ever a member of the sicarios , much less one of their leaders .
Born in Medellín , with a policeman for a father and an evangelist mother , he says he " studied all the way through grammar school " and went into the army as a teenager .
" When I left the military in 1986 , that 's when I started having trouble with the justice system , " he says .
" I was in jail three or four times because of theft . "
At his trial , though , prosecutors presented an entirely different picture of La Quica .
They placed him in a criminal conspiracy dating back to 1978 , when he was twelve years old .
They said he rose in the cartel with the aid of his brother Brance , also known as " Tyson " because of his resemblance to the boxer ; Tyson had known Escobar since childhood and had reportedly drawn others in his family into the drug trade .
Witnesses claimed to have seen La Quica in the late 1980s among Escobar 's bodyguards at the drug lord 's headquarters , an 8,000 - acre ranch outside Medellín .
They claimed that La Quica appeared to be intimately involved with the planning of various tortures and murders .
He had a way with explosives , one said , and a talent for organization , requiring sicarios to notify him in advance of their intended targets and to bring a newspaper clipping to confirm the kill .
Muñoz Mosquera disputes this , of course .
Yes , he says , Tyson worked for Escobar .
Yes , several of his brothers died violently , at least three at the hands of police officers .
But he , La Quica , was only a small - time motorcycle thief .
The witnesses are lying .
He does not know them .
They could not have seen him in 1988 , as one claimed , because he was in prison for auto theft at the time .
Yes , he did escape that prison , along with Tyson , but not in a helicopter , as the newspapers claim .
Someone else left that prison in a helicopter .
Whatever his true role in the cartel , his name did not surface in connection with the Avianca bombing until years after the event .
Speculation in Colombia at the time pointed to Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha , also known as " The Mexican , " one of Escobar 's most feared associates , who was killed by police a few weeks later .
Other alleged co-conspirators included Tyson , but his little brother was not mentioned .
According to some reports , the bomb had been carried on board in a briefcase by a dupe -- a suizo -- who'd been instructed to turn a knob on a " radio " in the case shortly after takeoff .
The intended target may have been one of the remaining presidential candidates , César Gaviria , who was not on the plane and went on to be elected .
An alternate theory of the crime , presented at La Quica 's trials , is that the bomb was meant for two informants who were on the flight .
The Avianca disaster and the attack on the DAS headquarters a few days later -- an overkill attempt to eliminate General Miguel Maza , head of state security , who emerged unscathed -- provided dramatic evidence that Escobar was no longer a regional or even a national problem .
His organization had become an international terrorist threat .
The cartel was suspected in a rocket attack on the United States embassy in Bogotá , and men working for Escobar had been arrested in Miami while shopping for anti-aircraft missiles .
For American as well as Colombian officials , Escobar had become Public Enemy Number One .
Under intense pressure domestically as well as from the Americans to end the violence , President Gaviria began to tighten a noose around Escobar .
With the aid of sophisticated American spying equipment , Colombian forces chipped away at his cash flow and his hiding places .
Members of the rival Cali cartel eagerly supplied damaging information , too .
By the summer of 1991 , Escobar was willing to deal .
He agreed to surrender on a minor drug charge and be sent to La Catedral -- a prison in his hometown , controlled by forces friendly to him -- rather than be shot on sight by stalking teams of police or snipers on the payrolls of rival cartels .
The arrangement did little to disrupt his activities ; he brought family members and prostitutes to his handsome suite , conducted business by phone , even tortured informants on occasion while his " guards " looked the other way .
But the news that Escobar was a prisoner gave the impression that the government had triumphed .
La Quica was back in a Colombian prison in 1991 , too .
He says the charge had to do with possession of a weapon ; other reports state that he was arrested for armed robbery .
( One document connected with the offense indicates a pending homicide investigation . )
He was still in prison , he notes , when a car bomb killed several government officials at a Colombian bullring , another crime his accusers have tried to blame on him .
In April , he escaped again .
That fall , though , he found himself in a predicament from which he could not walk away .
One rainy day in September 1991 , acting on a tip that La Quica had slipped into the United States undetected , DEA agents staked out a phone booth in Queens .
When Muñoz Mosquera showed up , they arrested him at gunpoint .
" I was carrying a fake passport and a fake photo ID , " he recalls .
" The cops threw me to the ground and took the passport out of my pocket .
As soon as they stopped me , they told me my name .
They told me , ' You 're La Quica . ' "
Muñoz Mosquera wo n't say why he was in the U.S. , only that he was " fleeing the Colombian justice system . "
DEA agents told reporters they believed he would come to America only if he was on a mission of some kind , and they offered a range of possible targets : DEA buildings , suspected informants , even President Gaviria and President George Bush , who were scheduled to attend upcoming events at the United Nations .
He 'd apparently managed to take in some sightseeing along the way ; one of his stops en route to New York had been a motel in California , within walking distance of Disneyland .
He was charged with carrying false identification and giving false information to a federal officer .
The typical sentence for those offenses is six months .
But prosecutors argued that Muñoz Mosquera was a major player in the most vicious criminal organization on the planet , and they needed time to build a larger case against him .
The judge gave him the maximum sentence : six years .
La Quica was stunned .
Aside from the little matter of the fake passport , he had committed no crimes in the United States .
How could they keep him here ?
But keep him they did , pending the filing of more serious charges .
In the summer of 1992 , a grand jury returned an indictment on thirteen counts of murder , drug trafficking , racketeering and terrorism .
At the heart of the indictment was a little - known 1986 law that authorized federal prosecution for terrorist acts committed against U.S. citizens abroad .
The deaths of two Americans on Flight 203 had placed La Quica 's hide under American jurisdiction .
Pablo Escobar was also named in the indictment , although there was little chance he would ever stand trial .
Just weeks before , he had walked away from his temporary quarters at La Catedral , thwarting the government 's efforts to move him to a " real " prison .
He was now the most hunted fugitive in the hemisphere .
According to Bowden 's Killing Pablo , virtually everyone who was after him -- the Colombian police and military , the vigilante groups , the rival cartels , the covert American operatives -- wanted him dead .
Period .
After Muñoz Mosquera 's conviction on the fake ID charge , " they sent me to the prison in Marion , Illinois , " he recalls .
" Then they took me to court again .
I was taken to the basement .
There were a bunch of DEA agents there .
They said that if I helped them find Escobar , they would put me in a good prison where I would be able to have relations with my wife .
I would get a reconsideration of sentence .
And if I did not help them , they would put me in the electric chair . "
Over the next two years , federal prosecutors and the DEA prepared their case against La Quica , assembling the physical evidence and interrogating high - ranking drug informants in American prisons and abroad .
By the time the case finally came to trial , in the spring of 1994 , the Medellín cartel was in ruins .
Escobar 's people had been picked off one by one .
Some surrendered .
Others were killed by police " while trying to escape " ( a common euphemism for an informal execution ) or assassinated by vigilantes .
In the fall of 1992 , lured by the promise of a $ 143,000 reward , an informant tipped a combined police - and - army unit to the whereabouts of La Quica 's brother Tyson , wanted for crimes ranging from the 1990 Mother 's Day bombing of shopping centers in Bogotá to the contract murders of more than 250 police officers .
According to official reports , the 33 - year - old Tyson was killed after he greeted the soldiers with a burst of machine - gun fire .
La Quica says his brother had recently been in a car accident and was in bed at the time : " The police came into his house , into his bedroom and shot him . "
In December 1993 , it was Escobar 's turn .
After months of near - misses , the military had pinpointed his location in Medellín by eavesdropping on his phone calls .
The former seventh - richest billionaire was shot and killed while attempting to flee across a rooftop .
Despite Escobar 's death , the security at Muñoz Mosquera 's trial was hypervigilant .
A jailhouse informant claimed La Quica had plotted a prison escape and talked about arranging to have prosecutor Cheryl Pollak 's throat slit .
Muñoz Mosquera denied it all .
Pollak was assigned 24 - hour protection , and extra teams of federal marshals guarded the Brooklyn courtroom .
A SWAT team waited in the courthouse basement , in case of an attempted escape or terrorist attack .
But the greatest threats to a successful prosecution of La Quica came from three unexpected sources : the Colombian government , the FBI 's own crime lab , and the jury .
The first monkey wrench was hurled by Colombian attorney general Gustavo de Greiff .
Right before the trial , de Greiff wrote to Judge Sterling Johnson to inform him that Colombia already had a suspect in custody who was considered to be the man responsible for the destruction of Flight 203 and the DAS bombing .
An Escobar associate named Carlos Maria Alzate had confessed to both crimes , implicating various co-conspirators who were already dead .
" I felt necessary to inform you ... with the intention to avoid the miscarriage of justice in the case you have in your hands , " de Greiff wrote .
" We have no evidence linking Mr. Muñoz Mosquera to that attack . "
Both the DEA and the defense had interviewed Alzate in a Colombian prison .
The prosecution team was convinced that his confession had been offered in return for a more lenient sentence on other pending charges ; his information did n't match up with what was already known about the bombings .
Even if he was involved , they reasoned , that did n't preclude the possibility that Muñoz Mosquera was involved , too .
The defense was not as eager to dismiss Alzate , but Judge Johnson refused to postpone the trial , and the confession was never presented as evidence in Muñoz Mosquera 's defense .
( For bringing the confession to the judge 's attention , Gustavo de Greiff got his own special thanks from the prosecution .
At the second trial , two government witnesses accused de Greiff , Colombia 's top drug warrior , of being bribed or blackmailed by cartel leaders ; Judge Johnson suggested that de Greiff could be an " unindicted co-conspirator . "
De Greiff denied the accusations .
Years later , the Clinton administration would revoke de Greiff's U.S. visa -- he was then Colombia 's ambassador to Mexico -- claiming alleged ties to drug traffickers .
De Greiff and his supporters maintain that he is the victim of a smear campaign because of his outspoken criticism of America 's drug - war policies . )
Still , the fact that Alzate 's claims were being taken seriously in Colombia meant that La Quica 's prosecutors had to be prepared to discredit them .
And that led to the second monkey wrench , courtesy of FBI agent Whitehurst .
Whitehurst had supervised the FBI lab analysis of explosives residues gathered at the crash site .
His initial report had identified the presence of high explosives known as RDX and PETN .
Alzate claimed that the explosive used had been dynamite .
Richard Hahn , the field agent investigating the bombing , asked Whitehurst if his residue analysis could establish that no dynamite had been used , thus discrediting Alzate 's story .
Whitehurst replied that he could n't rule out the possibility of dynamite .
Furthermore , he could n't rule out the possibility that his initial conclusions were erroneous because of contamination problems in the lab .
Much to the prosecution 's chagrin , he committed this information to writing , and his memorandum would have to be disclosed to the defense .
The tiff was part of an ongoing disagreement between Whitehurst and various field agents over mishandled evidence and distorted testimony in several major FBI cases , including the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings .
Procedures in the FBI lab lacked proper oversight , Whitehurst says , and he was under tremendous pressure from less scientifically trained case agents to make his findings fit their theory of the crime .
" All I was doing , as a scientist , was telling them what the data could mean , " Whitehurst adds .
" I could n't discount the possibility that somebody used dynamite .
But they want the answer they want , and they just want to attach your credentials to it .
That 's what was going on with the Muñoz Mosquera case . "
Yet Whitehurst 's doubts about what the physical evidence showed were never presented to the jury at either trial .
Muñoz Mosquera says he never understood why his attorney , Richard Jasper , did n't try to use the Alzate confession or Whitehurst 's memo , particularly after the first prosecution ended in a mistrial .
Jasper could n't be reached for comment .
In its investigation of the problems in the FBI lab , the Inspector General 's Office concluded that Agent Hahn had testified to matters that were " beyond his expertise " at the Avianca trials and that his notions of what constituted expert knowledge of explosives were " incorrect and dangerous . "
His testimony at the second trial was also incomplete because it failed to acknowledge Whitehurst 's dissenting memo , the report added .
At the same time , the report blasted that memo as " scientifically flawed " and characterized Whitehurst 's conduct in the affair as unprofessional .
The prosecutors ' response to the Inspector General 's report took issue with many of its conclusions .
Their chief argument was that the type of explosive used was irrelevant ; the government 's case had relied much more strongly on twenty " cooperating witnesses , " mostly former Escobar associates turned informants , who had tied Muñoz Mosquera to the cartel and the bombing .
The first time around , two jurors were curiously unmoved by the testimony of those witnesses .
They believed La Quica was being scapegoated , and no amount of haranguing by their fellow jurors could change their minds .
At the second trial , prosecutors Pollak and Beth Wilkinson had an even stronger lineup of snitches and a more cooperative panel .
Some of the most damning testimony came from Carlos Botero , a former major trafficker in Escobar 's employ who claimed to have gone on bombing runs with Muñoz Mosquera .
( One such trip , he said , involved an aborted attempt to kill the senior George Bush by firing a rocket at Air Force One . )
Escobar told him La Quica had done the Avianca job , Botero testified , and Muñoz Mosquera himself had once boasted about " blowing up an airplane to kill two sons - of - bitches informants . "
Muñoz Mosquera listened through headphones but showed no sign of recognizing the cooperating witnesses .
He did not know them , he insisted .
He was not the man they were talking about .
The jury thought he was .
They found him guilty on all thirteen counts on December 19 , 1994 .
It was the first successful federal prosecution of a terrorist for killing Americans on foreign soil , the first federal conviction for an airline bombing .
Judge Johnson seemed disappointed that Pollak and Wilkinson had n't sought to make it a capital case .
Before passing sentence , he told the defendant : " Not only are you an evil man , the things that you did , you enjoyed .
These things cry out for the death penalty . "
La Quica had a short speech prepared in Spanish : " I 'd just like to say that God and the government know I 'm innocent .
Thank you very much , and God bless you . "
Judge Johnson gave him ten life sentences .
Plus 45 years .
In 1995 , Attorney General Janet Reno presented the Exceptional Service award , the Justice Department 's highest honor , to prosecutors Pollak and Wilkinson and lead DEA agent Sam Trotman for their efforts in the Muñoz Mosquera case .
Pollak is now a federal magistrate judge .
Wilkinson went on to play a principal role in the prosecutions of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols and is now in private practice .
Neither one responded to requests for comment about Muñoz Mosquera .
Agent Trotman declined comment , too , saying that he needed to obtain clearance from his superiors .
Fred Whitehurst is now the director of the Forensic Justice Project , a nonprofit watchdog group that investigates crime - lab blunders .
In 1997 , on the day the Inspector General 's report on the FBI lab came out , " I was put on administrative leave and kicked out of the building , " he says .
" A year later I settled a lawsuit with the FBI .
It was just like I 'd retired at 57 .
I thought it was a retirement , anyway -- until I walked out and realized they 'd snookered the paperwork and put it out as a resignation . "
According to Whitehurst , problems at the FBI lab continue .
" [ Retiring director ]
Louis Freeh turned the FBI from a billion - dollar - a - year enterprise to a three - billion - dollar - a - year enterprise , but none of that money was set aside for oversight , " he says .
" I worked the highest - profile cases the bureau had when I was there , and I tell you , the pressure to come up with the ' right ' results was phenomenal .
You get to a point where you have to establish your own morality . "
Smashing the Medellín and Cali cartels is considered one of the great successes of the drug war , yet the cartels ' demise failed to arrest the flow of drugs and violence in Colombia .
It merely changed the shape of the business .
Now the drug trade is controlled by smaller , more elusive groups with intimate ties to Marxist guerrillas or right - wing paramilitary movements .
Some of these players were boosted into prominence by their vigilante efforts -- aided by American training and equipment -- in the crusade against Escobar .
" Colombia is reaping the whirlwind , " says Bruce Bagley , a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who writes frequently on narco - politics .
" There are benefits , certainly , to dismantling two of the largest criminal organizations ever seen on the face of the earth .
But what we did n't anticipate were the unintended consequences of leaving a vacuum .
Rather than the traditional cartels , we have the chaos that is now Colombia .
The guerrillas and the paramilitaries are all fed by drug money . "
Dandenis Muñoz Mosquera sits in a glass booth at ADX , serving ten lifetimes for crimes that officials in his own country say were committed by others .
It 's as if France had convicted John Doe Number Two , a terrorist the FBI says does not exist , for killing a Frenchman in the Oklahoma City bombing .
La Quica still can't believe it .
He has documents .
He has alibis .
Nobody will listen to him .
" They did n't care that I had n't committed any crimes , " he says .
" They just wanted to use me ... It 's only in this country that they put those charges against me , because they thought I could lead them to Escobar ... These other people confessed .
The Colombian government made an investigation and determined those confessions were correct . "
He is trapped in the lens of the drug war , which magnifies certain details and obliterates others .
Gaze through one end of the tube and you see one of the great monsters of our age , a bomber of airplanes and daycare centers , a contract killer with the indiscriminate cruelty of a deranged child .
Look through the other end and you see a little man in a box , still talking , still searching for an exit .
The Death of the Republican Party by Harry Browne November 4 , 1998 After passing the biggest budget in American history , the Republican Congress celebrated with an oversized press conference on October 20 .
Their statements implied that the party 's slogan should now be " We work for smaller government by spending more . "
While claiming to leave more money in your hands , they boasted of all the new ways they 're going to spend your money . . .
There are $ 12 billion in new federal education programs ( from the party that promised to eliminate the Department of Education ) .
There are unspecified billions of new farm subsidies ( from the party that recently passed the " Freedom to Farm " act  which was supposed to phase out farm subsidies once and for all ) .
There are new programs and money for the War on Drugs , the IMF , and home health care programs .
At the press conference the Republicans boasted of balancing the budget , while renewing their dedication to " saving Social Security . "
But they neglected to mention that the budget was " balanced " only by stealing almost $ 200 billion in surplus receipts from Social Security .
They spoke often of " the first tax cut in 15 years , " but offered no details  probably because the cuts were so puny , and because no one who voted for the budget bill has read any of its 4,000 pages .
Republican politicians continue to believe you 're too dumb to notice when " the party of smaller government " brags about making government bigger .
Like President Clinton , Republican politicians believe they can get away with anything .
But they are n't as slick as Bill Clinton , and so they usually wind up paying for their arrogance .
Ironically , the potential impeachment of Bill Clinton may be the last straw  the one leading to the downfall of the Republican Party .
Bill Clinton has committed many crimes against the Constitution .
Among them are the wars he waged against Iran , the Sudan , and Afghanistan without a Congressional declaration of war .
He trampled on the 1st Amendment by censoring the Internet , the 2nd Amendment by enforcing the Brady Bill , the 4th Amendment with asset forfeitures , the 5th Amendment by incinerating the Branch Davidians , and the 9th and 10th Amendments with programs the Constitution does n't authorize .
In short , a power - mad President is oppressing the American people .
So for what offense are Republicans demanding his impeachment ?
That he lied about an affair with an intern .
By reacting to only the most petty of his sins , the Republicans have endorsed , validated , and approved of all the other Constitutional crimes Bill Clinton has committed .
And why do n't the Republicans hold him to account for his real crimes ?
Because they have aided and abetted every one of them .
They applauded his war - making , and they voted for his Constitution - busting programs .
The Republican Party is losing its reason for existence .
Yes , they retained control of Congress in the recent election , but their days are numbered nonetheless .
They won because less than 40 % of eligible voters went to the polls .
Probably most of the non-voters see no fundamental difference between the two old parties .
How will the non-voters react when there 's a visible third party making specific proposals to get government out of their lives ?
Fortunately , the cavalry is coming  in the form of the Libertarians .
They are preparing to run a strong , well - financed campaign in 2000 , and could be a major party within two to four years .
Offering specific , smaller - government solutions on every issue , the Libertarians want to free you completely from the income tax , take your Social Security away from greedy politicians , and make your neighborhood safe by ending the insane War on Drugs .
I believe that one day soon the Libertarians will be one of two major parties .
The other will be the Democratic Party .
There always will be a market for a party that promises a free lunch .
But there wo n't always be a market for a party whose sales pitch is : " Yes , we spend a lot of your money , but the Democrats would spend even more . "

There are fears that the unrest could have longer term consequences for the country .
Moeketski Mosola , head of South Africa Tourism , told the BBC the government is alarmed by the situation , especially as they are preparing to host the football World Cup in 2010 .
" We are extremely concerned about the situation on the ground , you must remember that 67 % of the tourists coming into South Africa are mainly African , " he told the BBC's World Tonight programme .
Cape Town is the hub of South Africa 's tourism industry .
There have also been new attacks in Strand , east of Cape Town , Durban and North - West province , where three people , reportedly from Pakistan , were stabbed and dozens of Mozambican and Somali nationals displaced .
On Thursday , troops were deployed to quell attacks - the first time soldiers have been used to stamp out unrest in South Africa since the 1994 end of apartheid .
Shops looted Police said it took them eight hours to contain the unrest in Dunoon , 25 km from the city centre , and several people were arrested .
" Some people were assaulted , but mostly shops were looted , " police spokesman Billy Jones told AFP news agency .
John , a Malawian at the Dunoon meeting , said it disintegrated and foreigners started fleeing as groups began to loot Somali - owned shops .
" We feared for our safety .
They 're just killing everyone - they start beating you when they find out you 're a foreigner , " he told the BBC , adding that he was returning home as soon as possible .
Thursday night 's unrest prompted some 500 people , including Somalis , Mozambicans and Nigerians , as well as Zimbabweans to flee their homes , some seeking refuge in police stations .

It said more than half of the miners on Thursday 's day shift had failed to report for work .
Almost a third of the mine 's semi-skilled workers are foreign .
National Union of Mineworkers President Senzeni Zokwana appealed for calm .
" This situation has to stop ; it cannot continue happening ; it does n't help the local people to chase others away .
It is just wrong , " he told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
Mozambique 's president has urged his compatriots not to respond to the attacks .
His government has also mobilised emergency services normally used for natural disasters to cope with the exodus of an estimated 10,000 Mozambicans from South Africa .
Some Zimbabweans are also going home , preferring to risk the violence there than stay in South Africa .
One Zimbabwean woman told the BBC she had decided to return home from Johannesburg after seeing a gang douse a Mozambican immigrant with petrol and throw him into his burning shack .
" The screams of the burning Mozambican still haunt me .
When I close my eyes to try to sleep , I see the man screaming for help .
But no - one helps him , " she said .

Rumsfeld Personally Approved Brutal Interrogations
DOJ Official : Rumsfeld Personally Approved of Brutal Interrogations
By Jason Leopold , The Public Record
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld personally authorized the use of brutal interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay despite warnings from the FBI that the methods amounted to inhumane treatment , was possibly illegal , and would not produce reliable intelligence , a Department of Justice inspector general testified Tuesday .
" The FBI believed that these techniques were not getting actionable information , that they were unsophisticated and unproductive , " said Glenn Fine , the DOJ ’s inspector general , in testimony Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" They raised their concerns with the Department of Defense , but the Department of Defense , from what we were told , dismissed those concerns and that no changes were made in the Department of Defense 's strategy . "
Rumsfeld , who resigned immediately after the 2006 - midterm elections , has vehemently denied that he approved of torture .
The Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel provided the Defense Department with legal guidelines that authorized techniques such as waterboarding , the use of military dogs , and “ slaps ” and concluded that as long as “ organ failure ” did not occur the methods could not be construed as torture .
Fine issued a 437 - page report last month on the Bush administration ’s interrogation policies , which found that White House officials ignored FBI concerns about the treatment of detainees .
His testimony comes on the heels of a letter signed by 56 House Democrats that was sent to Attorney General Michael Mukasey last week Friday requesting that he appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether White House officials , including President Bush , violated the War Crimes
Act when they allowed interrogators to use brutal interrogation methods against detainees suspected of ties to terrorist organizations .
“ The Bush administration may have systematically implemented , from the top down , detainee interrogation policies that constitute torture or otherwise violate the law , " the letter to Mukasey says .
“ We believe that these serious and significant revelations warrant an immediate investigation to determine whether actions taken by the President , his Cabinet , and other Administration officials are in violation of the War Crimes Act , the Anti-Torture Act , and other U.S. and international laws . ”
In October 2002 , Fine said , FBI agents raised concerns with Marion Bowman , the Justice Department ’s deputy general counsel in charge of national security , about the methods used during interrogations at Guantanamo Bay .
An FBI agent stationed at Guantanamo then sent the agency an analysis on November 27 , 2002 calling into question the legality of the interrogation techniques , stating that the methods used appeared to violate the U.S. Torture statute .
Bowman then alerted Jim Haynes , the DOD ’s general counsel .
The same day Bowman raised concerns with Haynes , Haynes advised Rumsfeld to approve of the “ enhanced interrogation ” methods , according to Sen.
Dianne Feinstein , ( D - Calif. ) , who chaired Tuesday ’s committee hearing .
“ According to Mr. Bowman , Haynes claimed he did n't know anything about the coercive interrogation techniques that were occurring at Guantanamo , despite the fact that he recommended on November 27 , 2002 , that Secretary Rumsfeld formally approve the very techniques that were being used at Guantanamo , ” Feinstein said .
Rumsfeld , Fine told the committee , ignored FBI agents ’ warnings and on Dec. 2 , 2002 signed an action memorandum approving the use of “ enhanced techniques ” against prisoners at Guantanamo , concluding that the tactics stopped short of torture .
“ These were n’t a few bad apples on the night shift , as we ’ve been told , ” said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) in response to Fine ’s testimony .
On Nov. 23 , 2002 , four day before the FBI agent alerted the DOJ about interrogation tactics he witnessed , Rumsfeld verbally authorized interrogators to used harsh methods during their interrogation of Mohammed al - Qhatani , the so - called 20th hijacker , who was being held at Guantanamo .
Al - Qahtani was sentenced to death earlier this year , but the Pentagon dropped war - crimes charges against him last month .
Torture Log
The harsh treatment of al - Qahtani was catalogued in an 84 - page log of his interrogation that was leaked in 2006 .
The so - called “ torture log ” shows that beginning in November 2002 and continuing well into January 2003 , al - Qahtani was subjected to sleep deprivation , interrogated in 20 - hour stretches , poked with IV ’s , and left to urinate on himself .
If al - Qahtani ’s case had gone forward , the U.S. government would have been forced to reveal its own violations of the Geneva Convention , anti-torture statutes and the laws of war , according to lawyers representing al - Qahtani .
“ All of the [ incriminating ] statements Mohammad al - Qahtani made or is alleged to have made were the result of torture or made under the threat of torture and that is in my view why the government decided to dismiss his case at this point , ” said Vince Warren , executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) in New York .
CCR has been representing Mohammed al - Qahtani since 2005 and has led the legal battle for the human rights of detainees incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , for the last six years .
Army IG Report Fingers Rumsfeld
Dec. 20 , 2005 , Army Inspector General Report relating to the capture and interrogation of al - Qahtani included a sworn statement by Lt. Gen. Randall M. Schmidt .
It said Secretary Rumsfeld was “ personally involved ” in the interrogation of al - Qahtani and spoke “ weekly ” with Maj .
Gen. Geoffrey Miller , the commander at Guantanamo , about the status of the interrogations between late 2002 and early 2003 .
Gitanjali S. Gutierrez , an attorney with CCR , said in a sworn declaration that his client , imprisoned at Guantanamo , was subjected to months of torture based on verbal and written authorizations from Rumsfeld .
“ At Guantánamo , Mr. al - Qahtani was subjected to a regime of aggressive interrogation techniques , known as the ‘ First Special Interrogation Plan , ’ that were authorized by U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , ” Gutierrez said .
“ Those techniques were implemented under the supervision and guidance of Secretary Rumsfeld and the commander of Guantánamo , Major General Geoffrey Miller .
These methods included , but were not limited to , 48 days of severe sleep deprivation and 20 - hour interrogations , forced nudity , sexual humiliation , religious humiliation , physical force , prolonged stress positions and prolonged sensory over - stimulation , and threats with military dogs . ”
According to the Schlesinger report , orders signed by Bush and Rumsfeld in 2002 and 2003 authorizing brutal interrogations “ became policy ” at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib .
Hypocrisy
Ironically , Rumsfeld , as well as other senior Bush administration officials , expressed outrage in the first week of the Iraq War when Iraqi TV interviewed several captured American soldiers saying such behavior violated the Geneva Conventions .
At a March 25 , 2003 , press briefing about progress in the US . - led invasion , Secretary Rumsfeld said , “ This war is an act of self defense , to be sure , but it is also an act of humanity .
…
In recent days , the world has witnessed further evidence of their [ Iraqi ] brutality and their disregard for the laws of war .
Their treatment of coalition POWs is a violation of the Geneva Conventions . ”
The record now shows that during the same week in March 2003 – when Rumsfeld was publicly berating Iraq for violating the Geneva Convention by broadcasting footage of American POW ’s – he was engaged in drafting a top - secret plan that would give military interrogators at Guantanamo wide latitude to use harsher techniques to obtain information from prisoners .
Rumsfeld signed off on the plan on April 2 , 2003 , according to documents declassified and turned over to the American Civil Liberties Union last month in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit .
Though some of the more extreme techniques were dropped as the list was winnowed down to 24 from 35 , the final set of interrogation methods Rumsfeld approved still included tactics for isolating and demeaning a detainee , known as " pride and ego down . "
“ The most commonly reported technique used by non-FBI interrogators on detainees at Guantanamo was sleep deprivation or disruption , ” Fine testified Tuesday .
“ Sleep adjustment ” was explicitly approved for use by the military at Guantanamo under the policy approved by the Secretary of Defense in April 2003 .
Numerous FBI agents told the OIG that they witnessed the military ’s use of a regimen known as the “ frequent flyer program ” to disrupt detainees ’ sleep in an effort to lessen their resistance to questioning and to undermine cell block relationships among detainees . ”
Additionally , Fine said , “ Prolonged short - shackling , in which a detainee ’s hands were shackled close to his feet to prevent him from standing or sitting comfortably , was another of the most frequently reported techniques observed by FBI agents at Guantanamo .
This technique was sometimes used in conjunction with holding detainees in rooms where the temperature was very cold or very hot in order to break the detainees ’ resolve .
Stress positions were prohibited at Guantanamo under DOD policy beginning in January 2003 .
However , these FBI agents ’ observations confirm that prolonged shortshackling continued at Guantanamo for at least a year after the revised DOD policy took effect .
Such degrading tactics would appear to contravene the Geneva Convention , which bars abusive or demeaning treatment of captives .
Yet even after the programs governing interrogations were exposed , Rumsfeld made sure that a loophole in a new Defense Department policy issued in November 2005 , which barred torture and called for the " humane " treatment of detainees , gave him and his deputy the authority to override it .
" Intelligence interrogations will be conducted in accordance with applicable law , this directive and implementing plans , policies , orders , directives , and doctrine developed by DoD components and approved by USD ( I ) , unless otherwise authorized , in writing , by the secretary of defense or deputy secretary of defense , " the policy says .
" USD ( I ) " refers to the undersecretary of defense for intelligence .

Leading Women
Some represented monumental firsts and some lost their lives for it , but all of these " Iron Ladies " showed that women can indeed run a country , even decades at a time .
Queen Elizabeth II

Queen of the British Commonwealth for 56 years and counting , no female head of state even comes close to Elizabeth 's record for longevity or clout .
Elizabeth II is more than just a figurehead , she is a veritable global institution – just recently slowing her grueling schedule of world travel at the age of 82 .

President Nixon once called her an " old witch , " but Indira Gandhi still managed to triple his five years in office , serving as India 's prime minister from 1966 - '77 and again from 1980 - ' 84 .
Gandhi served during tumultuous times for the country , ultimately losing her life to a bullet fired by her own bodyguards .
Continuing on the family tradition , Indira 's son succeeded her but was also assassinated .
Margaret Thatcher

After she became Britain 's first Prime Minister in 1979 , Margaret Thatcher figured she may as well stick around for a bit and get things done too , serving three terms in office until 1990 .
The original " Iron Lady " had a hand in the fall of Communism , pushed her Conservative policies unabashedly and even survived an IRA bomb attack , raising two kids all the while .
Golda Meir

It took just 20 years for the new state of Israel to elect its first female prime minister , Golda Meir , who grew up in Milwaukee but settled in Palestine to fight for Israeli statehood .
As one of the founding " fathers " of the nation – her predecessor once called her " the only man in the cabinet " – she was brought out of retirement at age 70 to become its leader in 1969 , leading Israel through the massacre at the Munich Olympics and the Yom Kippur War .

MAY 27 -- A teenage girl claims that Westchester County cops last year confiscated a sex tape of hers during the execution of a search warrant and then showed the X - rated video to law enforcement colleagues for their amusement and ' sexual gratification . '
According to a federal lawsuit , a copy of which you 'll find here , the tape showed the New York girl 'at age fifteen , naked and engaging in oral sex and vaginal intercourse . '
The girl , now 17 and identified as ' Jane Doe ' in the May 21 U.S. District Court complaint , charges that a trio of Harrison Police Department officers screened the video after it was retrieved from the bedroom of Joseph Porto , the girl 's boyfriend ( a law enforcement source told TSG that police examined statutory rape charges , but could not positively identify the male in the video , though they suspected it was Porto ) .
The girl was present in Porto 's home while the residence was being searched last May following his arrest on a felony marijuana distribution charge .
The girl claims that police watched the video in her presence ' while laughing , ' and that they put a camcorder in her face and ' mockingly ' asked her questions about the explicit video as it played .
She also alleges that a Harrison detective told her , ' I should beat your ass for this .
I hope your parents beat your ass . '
The teenager claims that the investigator also retrieved anal beads from a bedroom , put them in her face , and asked , ' What do you do with these -- put them in your mouth ? '
The girl charges that cops subsequently played the video ' sufficiently close to the cell in which the boyfriend was incarcerated so that he could hear the audio component of the video , ' and that they laughed about the video and made ' repeated references by name to his girlfriend as she was depicted on the video . '
She also contends that the Harrison officers ' thereafter played the video for other members of the department to watch for their amusement , sexual gratification , and to further degrade Plaintiff . '
Among other causes of action , the girl 's lawsuit , which does not specify monetary damages , claims that her privacy has been violated and she was falsely imprisoned .
Captain Anthony Marraccini said that he and his two codefendants deny all of the girl 's ' outlandish claims . '
Her lawyer , Jonathan Lovett , did not return a TSG phone message about the lawsuit .

Greenfinches , ptarmigans and even the common blackbird could be among the next British birds to begin the slide towards extinction , according to a report published today .
The birds were highlighted by a new " early warning system " designed to identify species currently abundant but at risk of serious decline in the future .
By predicting the next species likely to suffer a fall in numbers researchers hope to give conservationists a head start .
At least a fifth of British birdlife is already on the nation 's red list of endangered species , a figure that is expected to rise when the list is revised later this year .
According to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , the number of red-listed species could hit 50 or more , and include the woodpecker , lapwing and curlew .
Gavin Thomas , a biologist at Imperial College London , used genetic records to create the first detailed family tree of British birdlife .
It shows how 249 , or 93 % , of the nation 's bird species are related .
When he checked which birds are endangered , he found them grouped on the family tree , suggesting that related birds shared traits that made them vulnerable to population decline .
Some , for example , shared low fertility rates while others had similar dietary or habitat needs .
Thomas used the family tree to spot birds likely to become threatened in the future , simply by checking if any of their close relatives have already appeared on the endangered list .
" This study threw up some interesting results , " said Thomas , whose research appears in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
The common blackbird had , he said , " several close relatives , including the song thrush , that are experiencing severe levels of population decline .
This could mean that populations of blackbirds in the UK are at risk of declining in the future . "
Other species at risk include the greenfinch , which is related to the endangered linnet and bullfinch , and the ptarmigan , still found in mountainous regions of Scotland such as the Cairngorms , which is closely related to the black grouse and grey partridge , which have both suffered severe declines in recent years .
This is driven by a variety of factors , including intensive farming , climate change and hunting .
This month naturalists disclosed that puffin numbers on the Isle of May , home to the largest puffin colony in the North Sea , had unexpectedly fallen by a third this year .
They blamed climate change and overfishing .
Grahame Madge at the RSPB said the study offered conservationists a new tool for assessing risks , but added that a complex mix of reasons was usually to blame .
" In a sense , it 's another way of seeing the ship sink , and we really have to find a way to keep it buoyant , " he said .

' Not tonight , Joséphine . '
Napoleon Bonaparte 's lacklustre response to the bedtime blandishments of his wife is being repeated every evening in bedrooms across the country .
Men are simply going off sex , according to the UK 's largest firm of relationship counsellors .
Relate , which provides counselling , sex therapy and relationship education , said there had been a 40 per cent increase in male clients admitting that , despite being physically able to have sex , they can't be bothered .
' Men used to come to us with impotence - now known as erectile insufficiency - but Viagra has sorted some of that problem , ' said Peter Bell , Relate 's head of practice .
' What we have is a lot of men who say , as women did in the Fifties : " I can have sex , but I do n't want to .
It 's not rewarding " . '
Bell says that around half the men he is now seeing admit to a complete lack of libido .
Ten years ago , he said , such complaints were unheard of .
' They tend to be men in their thirties , forties and fifties and married , ' he said .
' It is a serious issue .
It counts as a psychosexual dysfunction , rather than just a relationship problem , because these men have n't simply gone off their partner , but off sex altogether . '
Billy , 43 , a graphic designer in Newcastle upon Tyne , who has been married for 10 years , said his sexual desire had waned dramatically in the past three years .
' I still love my wife and am very clear that she 's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with , but I just do n't want to make love with her any more , ' he said .
' The curious thing is that I can get erections , and I do n't fancy or fantasise about other women .
It 's just that , over the years , my desire to have sex with anyone at all has faded .
' I 'm not particularly unhappy about the situation , but I am curious and have tried to work out why I feel this way , ' he said .
' My wife and I have always had a difficult relationship but , in the past , that always led to great sex .
It 's true that I have a stressful job , but previously sex helped me relax and forget my work problems .
I 'm baffled by my lack of interest , but not particularly unhappy . '
Bell said the problem is ' partly because women are more aware of what they want sexually and are prepared to ask for it ' .
He added : ' I think it 's also that men and women are more sexually similar than they like to think .
It is traditionally believed that , while women only enjoyed sex if it happened in the context of a positive and nurturing relationship , men could always be turned on by visual cues alone .
But what we 're seeing is that , once the thrill of the chase has disappeared and the sex is happening in a committed relationship , the libido of both men and women is affected by the quality of the relationship they are in . '
Professor Michael King , of the Royal Free and University College Medical School in London , believes the problem might lie in depression .
Last week he completed a study into mental illness across six countries which found that the rate of major depression and panic syndrome was highest among men in the UK .
' Men are most likely to suffer depression between the ages of 30 and 50 , ' said King .
' One of the explanations is that men are less able to talk about their problems than women or express their emotions . '
Professor Cary Cooper , president of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy , agreed .
' Men have less social support and , as a generalisation , are less emotionally intelligent than women and have not traditionally been encouraged to share their feelings , ' he said .
Cooper , who is professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University , also blamed Britain 's culture of long working hours .
' Britain 's work culture has gone from 9 to 5 to extremely long hours , which makes for a very stressful life , ' he said .
' Stress can be cumulative , which means eventually people can find it impossible to switch off and relax . '
Yay Omlets !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - People with depression have a higher risk of developing the most common form of diabetes than others , according to a study published on Tuesday that sheds light on the interplay between the two conditions .
The study indicated that the relationship between type 2 diabetes , the form of the disease closely linked to obesity and sedentary lifestyle , may be a bit like a two - way highway .
Not only can diabetes lead to depression , as has been well established , but depression can also lead to diabetes .
U.S. researchers led by Dr. Sherita Hill Golden of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore tracked an ethnically diverse group of about 5,000 men and women between ages 45 to 84 for about three years .
They found that people with symptoms of depression were 42 percent more likely to develop diabetes by the end of the study than those without such symptoms .
They also found that the more serious the symptoms , the higher the risk of diabetes .
The researchers statistically accounted for factors including obesity , lack of physical activity and smoking , and found that the risk for diabetes was still 34 percent higher in patients with depression .
“ When we looked at the people in our study who had elevated symptoms of depression , they were more likely to eat more calories , they exercised less , and they were more likely to be current smokers .
And as a consequence , they were also more obese , ” Golden , whose study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , said in a telephone interview .
“ And those are all known risk factors for type 2 diabetes .
So it seems that some of the adverse health behaviors associated with depressive symptoms were an important component of that relationship ( between depression and diabetes ) . ”
Golden added that depression also pushes up the levels of stress hormones such as cortisol .
TRIGGER EFFECT ?
Diabetes is a disease marked by high levels of sugar in the blood .
In type 2 diabetes , the body becomes resistant to the effects of the hormone insulin or the body produces some , but not enough , insulin to keep a normal blood sugar level .
Elevated cortisol levels can impair insulin sensitivity in the body and encourage belly fat , a risk factor for diabetes .
The study also measured the risk for developing depression among people who already had diabetes .
To do this , the researchers excluded people who had elevated symptoms of depression at the outset of the study .
People who had been treated for diabetes were 54 percent more likely to develop depression symptoms than the others .
An anomalous finding was that people who were deemed pre-diabetic -- the precursor to diabetes -- as well as people who actually had diabetes but did not know it were about 20 percent less likely to develop depression than non-diabetics .
The researchers suspect this may be at least in part because those people did not have the psychological burden of knowing they had a serious disease like diabetes .
Evidence is building that depression can trigger diabetes .
A study last year in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine headed by Mercedes Carnethon of Northwestern University in Chicago found that people age 65 and older with symptoms of depression were more likely to develop diabetes than those without depressive symptoms .
Carnethon participated in the new study as well .

Introduction
I 'm a big fan of pet projects .
You know the ones I mean : the projects we love to start and hate to finish .
The two - week remodeling gig that takes two years .
The '69 Mustang sitting on cinderblocks in the back yard while seasons rotate .
The unfinished novel lurking on the nether regions of your hard drive .
And for programmers and poker players around the world , a million unfinished tools and libraries ranging from the ingenious to the depressingly obscure .
Today , I 'd like to talk to you about a pet project which is actually worth your time .
Recently a frustrated Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the Zimbabwean opposition , wrote to tell the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , that " there will be no country left " in Zimbabwe by the time Mbeki finishes mediating between Robert Mugabe and Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change .
Tsvangirai was of course referring to Mbeki 's duplicity in his role as the Southern African Development Community 's official mediator between the Zimbabwean parties .
Mbeki favours Mugabe and the ruing Zanu - PF .
When pressed about the letter , Mbeki characteristically insisted that it had never arrived .
And rather than replying , Mbeki wrote to the American president , George Bush , instead , telling Bush " in a text packed with exclamation points " , that official US government criticisms of Mugabe were off the mark .
Mbeki , in what could also be interpreted as his first unambiguous public endorsement of Mugabe 's violent regime , charged that the Americans were " disrespecting the views of the Zimbabwean people " and should " butt out , that Africa belongs to [ Mbeki ] . "
Of course , since then Tsvangirai has pulled out of the Zimbabwean elections and Mbeki has been to Zimbabwe again , where he met with Mugabe last week .
This visit is in contrast to his behaviour , 10 days into the murderous pogrom against black immigrants to South Africa ( among them Zimbabweans fleeing the political and economic crises in their country ) , when Mbeki could only muster up a rote statement from the air - conditioned comfort of a TV studio .
A total of 62 people were murdered and thousands left homeless in the xenophobic violence .
And then Mbeki promptly left on a state visit to Japan .
Since then Mbeki has not once been out to one of the affected areas .
But he found time to visit Mugabe .
Reviewing the events of the last few weeks reminded me of the insights of the Nigerian writer and Nobel Laureate , Wole Soyinka , upon meeting Thabo Mbeki .
As Soyinka recounts it in his memoir You Must Set Forth at Dawn , he first met Mbeki at a dinner in honour of Nelson Mandela – Soyinka 's " favourite avatar " – in Paris , right after Mandela was released from an apartheid jail after 27 years .
The dinner was the " most expensive " that Soyinka ever attended .
The French president François Mitterand played host .
A small entourage accompanied Mandela , including the two men jostling to be his presumptive heir – Thabo Mbeki , who in the resistance movement 's exile was the right - hand man to Mandela 's predecessor Oliver Tambo , and Cyril Ramaphosa , who would lead the ANC in constitutional negotiations with the apartheid government .
The events of the dinner would be unremarkable , amounting to nothing more than a color piece , if not for Soyinka 's insights of Thabo Mbeki , who is now South Africa 's president .
At that time , black townships around Johannesburg and in Kwazulu - Natal province on the country 's east coast were engulfed by political violence , the result of a state - sponsored proxy war by Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party against members of Mandela 's African National Congress .
Soyinka , while acknowledging that Buthelezi was an unscrupulous and ethically challenged politician , reasoned that that since " the chief " had a large following , he needed to be recognised and engaged with – and that Mandela should personally meet with him .
So did Mandela and Ramaphosa ( Soyinka describes Ramaphosa 's manner as " more accommodating " ) .
The same cannot be said for " an unsmiling " Thabo Mbeki , who said : " It is not possible to hold a dialogue with that kind of person . "
Mbeki could hardly pronounce Buthelezi's name " without his smallish , nearly triangular face expunging all expression , leaving only the hardness of his eyes . "
( OK , even I agree that perhaps here Soyinka went a bit over the top with this description . )
Mbeki interjected a few more times , repeating his objections , what Soyinka likened to a " a party - line diktat " .
As Soyinka left the dinner , he summed up his impressions : " Even the body language of the two – Thabo Mbeki and Nelson Mandela – spoke volumes , and the contrast read out a stark warning . "

You go to the game at the American Airlines Center in Dallas , Texas .
Chicago beats Dallas 4 goals to 3 .
Then you call up your bookie and tell him that Dallas won the game and you want to pick up your money honey .

Who won Texas ?
The entire world has been mesmerized by the American election process since it began 14 months ago because the future of the Middle East and the World is hanging in the balance .
If a person is elected for a 4 year term and spends 2 years campaigning , shouldnâ��t the primary question in the votersâ�� minds be , â� �Who is the best campaigner ?â� ?
The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain .
Why doesnâ��t it fall on the mountains ?
Or , does it ?
If this will stop you from having a stroke , Hillary Clinton won Texas , because as in golf the person with the lower score wins â�� just telepath Lord Byron .
John McCain said , â� �Surge Accomplished.â� ?
If the surge worked then why arenâ��t the boys and girls home yet ?
Why arenâ��t the boys and girls home from Iraq yet if the surge has worked .
If the surge has worked why does John McCain tell us that the American troops will be in Iraq for another 100 years ?
Why are Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton telling us that if they are elected , they are going to bring the combat troops home from Iraq but not the non combat troops , unless something happens and they have to leave the combat troops there too .
What is the definition of a combat troop ?
How is your head feeling ?
The size of the clubhead is inversely proportional to the launch angle .
In â� �The Little Princeâ� ?
the fox said , â� �Words are a source of misunderstandingâ� ? , just so that I donâ��t get accused of plagiarism .
Do you remember plagiarism gate ?
I donâ��t .
What was that about ?
We seem to collectively have the attention span of a gnat .
We strain at gnats yet we swallow camels whole .
God came to earth to tell us that ?
Perhaps if I number every sentence my words will have more credibility .
( Ex. 20:1 - 20 ) .
If you are a Catholic and you thought that you were a Christian , then according to John McCainâ��s spiritual advisor John Hagee , you are wrong .
According to John McCainâ��s straight talk express spiritual advisor Pope Benedict XVI is actually a Hindu .
Donâ��t tell the Pontiff until next yontiff unless you want to see his red yarmulkah go flying off of his head into a McCain like rage .
Doesnâ��t it bother you when all the people who know John McCain like Senators and Generals who have worked with him say that they are afraid to give him the red buttons because he flips into these fits of irrational blind rage and every time that you hear him talking he sounds like a cross between Captain Kangaroo and Mister Rogers ?
The reason that words are a source of misunderstanding is because many words in the English language have 10 meanings and often our politicians and our media are not exactly candid with us .
Hillary Clinton won Texas .
Mission Accomplished .
Surge Accomplished .
We are bringing all of the combat troops home but we are leaving the non combat troops in Iraq .
What are non combat troops ?
Does that mean that if the Sunnis we armed or the Shiites who are playing possum until we leave fire upon them , they will just stand there and die ?
Our former enemy was Karl Marx .
Do you think that when Karl Benz invented the car 125 years ago he knew that in 125 years his invention would trap the United States of America in Iraq for 100 years , or was that Edgar Cayce , or Michel de Nostradame ?
The American public has been sitting mesmerized by poll numbers for 14 months and they do not know that Barack Obama won Texas a week ago .
O.K . Lets get serious for a moment .
Forget that .
The situation on earth right now is so bad that you either have to laugh or cry .
There will be plenty of time to cry during the Apocalypse .
Right now John McCain , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are fighting over who gets George Bushâ��s Trojan Horse .
The American people believe that who they elect will make a difference regarding climate change , nuclear world war 3 , a 10 trillion dollar deficit , 2 million Americans jailed by other Americans , etc .
How can you trust a country to vote for the right person when that country just elected George Bush twice ?
Perhaps whoever wins we should award the Presidency to the other person just based on the fact that we always get it wrong .

Anyone facing chemotherapy would welcome an advance promising to dramatically reduce their dose of these often harsh drugs .
Using nanotechnology , researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have taken a step closer to that goal .
The researchers focused a powerful drug directly on tumors in rabbits using drug - coated nanoparticles .
They found that a drug dose 1,000 times lower than used previously for this purpose markedly slowed tumor growth .
" Many chemotherapeutic drugs have unwanted side effects , and we 've shown that our nanoparticle technology has the potential to increase drug effectiveness and decrease drug dose to alleviate harmful side effects , " says lead author Patrick M. Winter , Ph.D. , research assistant professor of medicine and biomedical engineering .
The nanoparticles are extremely tiny beads of an inert , oily compound that can be coated with a wide variety of active substances .
In an article published online in The FASEB Journal , the researchers describe a significant reduction of tumor growth in rabbits that were treated with nanoparticles coated with a fungal toxin called fumagillin .
Human clinical trials have shown that fumagillin can be an effective cancer treatment in combination with other anticancer drugs .
In addition to fumagillin , the nanoparticles ' surfaces held molecules designed to stick to proteins found primarily on the cells of growing blood vessels .
So the nanoparticles latched on to sites of blood vessel proliferation and released their fumagillin load into blood vessel cells .
Fumagillin blocks multiplication of blood vessel cells , so it inhibited tumors from expanding their blood supply and slowed their growth .
Human trials have also shown that fumagillin can have neurotoxic side effects at the high doses required when given by standard methods .
But the fumagillin nanoparticles were effective in very low doses because they concentrate where tumors create new blood vessels .
The rabbits that received fumagillin nanoparticles showed no adverse side effects .
Senior author Gregory M. Lanza , M.D. , Ph.D. , associate professor of medicine and of biomedical engineering , and Samuel A. Wickline , M.D. , professor of medicine , of physics and of biomedical engineering , are co-inventors of the nanoparticle technology .
The nanoparticles measure only about 200 nanometers across , or 500 times smaller than the width of a human hair .
Their cores are composed mostly of perfluorocarbon , a safe compound used in artificial blood .
The nanoparticles can be adapted to many different medical applications .
In addition to carrying drugs to targeted locations , they can be manufactured to highlight specific targets in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , nuclear imaging , CT scanning and ultrasound imaging .
In this study , researchers loaded blood - vessel - targeted nanoparticles with MRI contrast agent and were able to make detailed maps of tumor blood vessel growth using standard MRI equipment .
The MRI scans showed that blood vessel formation tended to concentrate in limited areas on the surface at one side of tumors instead of dispersing uniformly , which was a surprise .
" Using the blood - vessel targeted nanoparticles , we get a far more complete view of tumor biology than we would get with any other technique , " Winter says .
" If you followed a tumor over a period of time with the nanoparticles and MRI scans , you would have a much better understanding of the tumor 's reaction to treatment . "
The researchers say they believe nanoparticle technology will be very useful for monitoring cancer treatment results in both the short and long term .
" It gives you a way of determining whether you should continue treatment , change the dose or even try a different treatment altogether , " Lanza says .
Prior work has shown that the nanoparticles can be loaded with many kinds of drugs .
The researchers used fumagillin nanoparticles in these experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach , but they plan further investigations with other versions of the nanoparticles .
" What this report clearly demonstrates is that our nanoparticles can carry chemotherapeutic drugs specifically to tumors and have an effect at the tumor site , " Lanza says .
" Sometimes when I give presentations about our nanotechnology , people react as if it was science fiction or at best a technology of the distant future .
But we 've shown that the technology is ready for medical applications now . "
The nanoparticles will be tested this year in preliminary human clinical trials to determine the optimal method for using them as imaging agents .
These studies will lay essential groundwork for using the nanoparticles as therapeutic agents .

Mr Rudd praised Mr Howard 's dignity in defeat
Rudd victory speech Australia 's prime minister - elect Kevin Rudd has outlined his priorities after winning a sweeping general election victory over outgoing PM John Howard .
Mr Rudd signalled a swift break with his predecessor 's policies by promising to sign the Kyoto Protocol and pull troops out of Iraq .
He also promised to attend next month 's UN climate change summit in Bali .
Meanwhile , Peter Costello - Mr Howard 's nominated successor - has turned down the post of opposition leader .
The BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney says that Australia 's conservatives are wounded and fractured and it could take them years to recover from this election defeat .
With just over 75 % of ballots counted , Mr Rudd's Labor has 53 % of the vote and Mr Howard 's conservative coalition 46.5 % .
US visit US President George W Bush - a close ally of Mr Howard - was among the world leaders to congratulate Mr Rudd on his election victory .
AUSTRALIAN ELECTION
More than 13.5 m of Australia 's roughly 21 m people registered to vote Electors choose candidates for all 150 seats in the lower House of Representatives and 40 of the 76 seats in the upper house , the Senate PM John Howard ( above ) has led the conservative Liberal - National party coalition to four election wins since 1996 Kevin Rudd is taking the centre - left Labor Party to the polls for the first time as leader Election issues :
The economy , environment and war in Iraq

In a statement Mr Bush said he looked " forward to working with this new government to continue our historic relationship " .
Mr Rudd , a former diplomat , is of the same mind , says the BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney , but his plans for a phased withdrawal of 500 Australian combat troops from Iraq may put those close ties to the test .
The Labor leader does however support the military campaign in Afghanistan and plans to visit the United States early next year .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown also congratulated Mr Rudd and welcomed the incoming prime minister 's pledge to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol on capping greenhouse gas emissions .
In his first news conference since his election , Mr Rudd promised " action and action now " on climate change .
He said he looked forward to meeting Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono after receiving his invitation to the Bali conference .
' New page '
Mr Rudd promised to name his new cabinet by the end of the week , with one of his key appointments expected to be Julia Gillard as deputy prime minister .
If appointed , Ms Gillard will become the first woman to hold the position .
Funniest moment of the campaign ?
For me it came in Bondi Junction , when I ran into Bob Hawke

In his victory speech on Saturday , the Labor leader said : " Today the Australian people have decided that we as a nation will move forward .
" To plan for the future , to prepare for the future , to embrace the future and together as Australians to unite and write a new page in our nation 's history . "
The swing to Labor is so far more than 6 % and analysts say the party is on course for a clear majority in the 150 - seat parliament for the first time since it lost to Mr Howard in 1996 .
Our correspondent says this is a humiliating defeat for Mr Howard and a day Labor has waited many years to see .
Its supporters are hoping Australia will become more compassionate under Kevin Rudd , he says .
The party 's environment spokesman , Peter Garrett , told the BBC Australia was on the brink of fundamental change .
" Australians have decided that they are going to throw out a government that has been delinquent on climate change , that has tried to recast our industrial relations laws , and which has n't shown any capacity to measure up to the challenges of the 21st Century . "
Howard blow
In his concession speech , Mr Howard said : " This is a great democracy and I want to wish Mr Rudd well .
HAVE YOUR SAY
After too many years I can finally hold my head up and be proud to call myself Australian again

" We bequeath to him a nation that is stronger and prouder and more prosperous than it was eleven and a half years ago . "
There were few moments of cheer for the Liberals .
Former political journalist , Maxine McKew , is close to removing Mr Howard from Bennelong and make him the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat for 78 years .
Voters in Bennelong have elected Mr Howard in 13 consecutive elections over 33 years .
Mr Rudd is expected to be sworn in as prime minister next week .

What are these ?
In my post of May 6th , “ Traditional Neighborhood Development and LEED Go Hand in Hand , ” I made the point that smart growth and new urbanism are helping give a ‘ boost ’ to green building practices .
While conducting research for that article , however , I did find several assertions to the contrary .
So , for the sake of playing devil ’s advocate , I will here take a look at some of those assertions .
It seems evident that small houses , situated in walkable neighborhoods , are greener than large homes occupying automobile - dependent sites .
The new LEED for Neighborhood Development ( LEED - ND ) rating system draws heavily from principles of new urbanism and smart growth .
New urbanism includes sustainability as one of its tenets ( see Green Communities , Part 1 : New Urbanism ) , and many of the primary elements of smart growth ( as listed on their website ) have become synonymous with green :
Preserve Open Space , Farmland , Natural Beauty and Critical Environmental Areas
Provide a Variety of Transportation Choices
Strengthen and Direct Development Towards Existing Communities
Take Advantage of Compact Building Design
But is density , in fact , a prerequisite for green development ?
Wayne A. Lemmon , a planner and real estate economist , argued in his article , “ Can Sprawl be Good , ” that ( among other things ) , “ Concentrating development in areas already served by public facilities makes good sense , but only up to the point where available capacity is fully utilized . ”
The National Association of Home Builders takes particular exception to the assumptions that underpin LEED .
Their online article , “ New LEED Certification for Development Found Wanting , ” examines LEED -ND , and proposes that it may actually be inhibiting the progress of green development .
NAHB land use planner Edward Tombari explains :
Based on NAHB ’s experience with smart growth and new urbanism design principles , a majority of the projects being built by developers today that incorporate Traditional Neighborhood Design ( TND ) principles might be able to achieve some lower - level LEED recognition .
However , while the number of communities using TND principles is rising , the vast majority do not because TND favors higher density and most new development occurs in suburban and exurban greenfield locations .
While this excludes much new development from being eligible to meet the criteria being established by LEED - ND , NAHB believes new development affords many opportunities for implementing green development principles .
Even though the notion of returning to ‘ Main Street America ’ seems to have captured the popular imagination , there is no sign that the production of large , detached , single - family homes will actually be coming to a halt anytime soon .
( Barbara Faga ’s article on Planetizen , “ Two Things People Hate : Density and Sprawl , ” spurred a lively debate on this topic a few weeks ago . )
So , if urban sprawl is on a roll that cannot yet be stopped , can a neighborhood rating system that prioritizes density accomplish significant change ?
Many industry professionals believe that the LEED programs in place so far have managed to make a broad impact upon construction practices precisely because they have not set the bar impossibly high .
Now the NAHB and the International Code Council are working on their own consensus - based National Green Building Standard , and this standard will be applicable to a wide range of developments , including conventional , suburban ones .
( To view progress on the draft Standard , visit the NAHB Research Center site . )
If consumers find the National Green Building Standard to be more adaptable than LEED , then perhaps LEED will have met its match in the American marketplace .

After 3 - 2 Victory for Germany Turks and Germans Party Side - by - Side
In the end it was the German team that won out over Turkey on Wednesday night in Basel .
Members of Germany 's Turkish community were disappointed but they still helped the German fans celebrate and plan to cheer on the team in the final on Sunday .
By Leo Babauta
As a runner , there is almost nothing in this world that can take me to the places that running does .
I find solitude in my running , I find my thoughts and my peace , I find energy and motivation , I come up with my best ideas and solve my toughest problems .
Running transforms me .
I try to encourage others to run , but even if they want to do it , they do n’t know how .
Today , I ’m going to give you my advice ( as an intermediate runner , not an expert ) on how to go from sitting on the couch to being a true runner .
I wo n’t say that it ’ll be easy , especially in the beginning .
But I will say that it wo n’t kill you ( assuming you do n’t have major health problems ) and that it will get easier and even fun in a few short weeks .
I will start with the standard disclaimer : Before starting this program , get checked out by a doctor , especially if you have any health risks , such as heart or lung problems , major diseases , pregnancy , or the like .
If you ’re fit enough to walk for 20 or 30 minutes , you should be able to do this program .
The Benefits of Running
Why should you even consider doing this program ( or running at all ) ?
Lots of reasons .
Just a few to start with :
You ’ll get healthier .
There are other ways to get healthy , of course , including dozens of other types of exercises .
But running is one great way .
If you stick to a moderate running program , I can almost guarantee that you ’ll get slimmer and your heart will get stronger and your cholesterol will go down .
Your diet is a big factor , of course , but more on that in the next benefit .
You ’ll eat better .
When you start running — and this can take a few weeks or more — you start to realize that what you eat is fuel .
And you realize that burgers and fries and soda are not the best fuel .
So you start to eat cleaner fuel , and it can start to be a lifetime habit .
This does n’t always happen , but I ’ve seen it happen a lot .
It may take awhile before you get a really clean diet , but the desire to change starts relatively soon .
You ’ll want to quit smoking .
It ’s hard to keep smoking if you really get into running .
Some people keep smoking while running , but I ’ve seen tons of runners who quit smoking , because they know that smoking does n’t jibe with their lifestyle .
If you ’re looking for a good way to quit , start with running .
You ’ll find solitude .
In the hectic bustle of everyday life , many people have trouble finding time for themselves , time to think and to find peace .
Running will become your oasis of peace , a time you look forward to each day .
Races are super fun .
Once you ’ve been running for a month or two , you should sign up for a 5 K .
It ’ll be a great time .
The camaraderie among runners , slow and fast , young and old , is a wonderful thing .
The feeling of accomplishment when you cross the finish line is unbeatable .
And after awhile , you might try 10Ks , half marathons , maybe even a marathon .
There ’s nothing like doing road races .
You ’ll lower your stress levels .
It beats smoking , drinking , vegging out in front of the television , almost anything else I can think of , for getting rid of the stresses of your life .
You ’ll think better .
Running is the time when my mind is clearest .
It ’s hard to really think about things when you have the noise of the modern world around you , but when you ’re alone on the road , you ca n’t help but think in silence .
You ’ll find the warrior within you .
There is something about running that transforms you .
In the beginning , it can be very difficult , and there will be times when you feel like stopping , but if you can beat that little negative voice inside you that wants to stop , you will learn that you can beat anything .
Running will teach you to overcome your doubts and negativity , and that ’s a gift that will take you to new heights in anything you do .
The Rules
Before we start , I ’d like to offer a few rules :
Start small .
This is mandatory .
Many people make the mistake of starting too hard , and they get burned out or injured or discouraged within a couple of weeks .
This program is designed to get you running for life , so if you have lots of enthusiasm when you start , that ’s great — but you MUST rein it in and start small .
That enthusiasm that you have to hold back will keep you going for much longer if you do n’t spend it all the first week .
Increase gradually .
Another mandatory rule .
If you do n’t follow this rule , you should n’t follow the program .
Trust me , I know how it feels like the rules of increasing gradually do n’t apply to you … I made that mistake when I started out and got injured .
Your mind ( and even your heart and lungs ) might be able to handle doing more , but your legs might not .
It takes awhile for your muscles and tendons and ligaments and joints to adjust to the stress of running , and if you progress to rapidly , you ’ll get injured .
Increase but very gradually .
Enjoy yourself .
Very mandatory .
If you do n’t enjoy yourself , you ’ll never stick with it .
So try to have as much fun as possible .
Enjoy getting fit and healthy !
Enjoy burning off your fat !
Enjoy the sweat !
Enjoy the relaxation of burning off stress !
Running should be fun , not torture .
If you can , get a partner .
This is not really a rule but a suggestion — if you can find a reliable partner , it makes it a bit easier .
First , having someone to talk to while you walk ( and later run ) makes the time go by extremely quickly .
Second , if you make an appointment to meet that person for your walk ( or run ) , you ’re more likely to stick to the appointment rather than wimp out .
The Five Steps
OK , here are the five steps to becoming a runner .
There are some rough timeframes in each step , but the real rule is to increase only when you feel ready , and no sooner .
If you need longer for a step , take longer .
There ’s no rush .
But if you think you can do it sooner , I would suggest that you not .
Step 1 : Start walking .
Start out by walking just 3 times the first week , and four times the second .
The first week , you only need to do 20 - 25 minutes .
Increase to 25 - 30 minutes the second week .
After this , you can graduate to the next step , or if you ’d like to stay in this step for a week or two longer , that ’s OK .
If you stay longer , walk 4 times the third week , 30 - 35 minutes each time .
The fourth week , stay at 4 times , but increase to 35 - 40 minutes .
Step 2 : Start run / walking .
Do this step very gradually , just a little more each time .
For this step , you ’ll continue to exercise 4 times a week .
You want to warm up by walking for 10 minutes .
Then do a very , very easy run / walk routine : jog lightly for 1 minute ( or 30 seconds if that seems too hard ) , then walk for 2 minutes .
Repeat these intervals for 10 - 15 minutes , then do a 10 - minute walking cool down .
Do this step for two weeks , or longer if you like .
Step 3 : Lengthen the running .
Once you ’re comfortable running for a minute at a time , for several intervals each time you exercise , you ’re ready to start running a little longer .
Continue to exercise 4 times per week .
Increase your running to 1 minute 30 seconds , with an equal walking ( 1:30 running , 1:30 walking ) for 15 minutes .
Do this a couple times or more , then increase running to two minutes , with walking for 1 minute .
Do this a few times or more , then increase to running 2:30 , walking 30 seconds to a minute .
If any of these increases feels too hard , feel free to go back a step until you ’re comfortable increasing .
Do n’t rush it .
You should stay in this step for 2 - 3 weeks or more .
Step 4 : Follow the Rule of 9 .
Once you start Step 3 above , you ’re basically running with short walk breaks .
This can seem difficult , but it ’ll get easier .
Commit to doing 9 running workouts in Step 3 … after that , it ’ll get easier .
The first 9 running workouts can be difficult , but after that , it almost always gets better and more enjoyable .
Do n’t quit before the 9 running workouts !
After the 9 , try running with only infrequent walk breaks .
Step 5 : Take your running to new levels .
First of all , celebrate !
You ’re now a runner .
You might be walking a little during your runs , but there ’s nothing wrong with that .
In fact , feel free to keep doing walk breaks as you work on your running endurance .
Some runners have been known to do a marathon with walk breaks , running 10 minutes and walking 1 minute .
That ’s completely fine .
Eventually you probably wo n’t need the walk breaks , but no need to rush .
In this step , you want to continue taking your running to new levels .
There are a number of ways to do this :
Gradually increase your running until you can do 30 - 40 minutes of running at a time , 4 days a week .
Do this increase gradually , as you should be mostly running for 15 minutes at a time by the end of Step 4 … just increase by 5 minutes each week .
Sign up for a 5 K .
If you can run for 30 - 40 minutes , you can complete a 5 K .
Sign up for one ( there are races almost every weekend in many places ) and participate with the idea of just finishing .
Have fun doing it !
Once you have increased your running to 30 - 40 minutes at a time , designate one run a week as your “ long run ” .
Try to increase this by 5 minutes each week , until you can do an hour or more .
This is your endurance run , and it is a key to most running programs .
Once you ’ve got endurance , you can add some hills to your program .
Add hills gradually , by finding a more hilly course , and eventually adding hill repeats — run ( kind of ) hard up the hill , then easy down the hill , and do 3 - 5 repeats .
After hills , do a little speed workout once a week .
Do intervals of a couple of minutes of medium - hard running , with a couple minutes of easy running .
Make these speed workouts shorter than your normal runs — if you run for 40 minutes , do 25 - 30 minutes for your speed workouts .
Be sure to warm up and cool down with easy running for 10 minutes .
Tempo runs are good workouts when you ’re ready .
That means a 10 minute warmup , then 20 minutes or so of running somewhere between your 10 K and half - marathon pace .
That means going the pace you think you can race for an hour , but only doing it for 20 - 30 minutes .
Run with a group , or run alone .
Do n’t always run alone or with a partner .
Mix things up .
Find new routes .
Do n’t always run the same routes .
Try running on a track , in a different neighborhood , on a treadmill , on trails .
After you ’ve done a few 5Ks , sign up for a 10 K .
Then a half marathon .
Then a marathon .
But do one step at a time .
Most of all , enjoy your runs !
$ 104,655.60 Ad in the Washington Post
Here is someone with the money to fund a rebuttal to what Howard Dean , Democratic National Committee Chairman , said recently that many Republicans have never done an honest day ’s work in their life .
The following full page ad was placed in the Washington Post by a businessman named George J. Esseff , Sr. He paid $ 104,655.60 to run the ad and only did it because he is sick and tired of the way that “ the rich ” are
portrayed by liberals these days .
It is a great read .
You ’re a Republican ???
In today ’s America , ask a growing number of high school and college students ; their teachers and professors ; the self - anointed media elite and / or hard working men and women of all ethnicities , the question , “ What is a Republican ? ” , and you ’ll be told “ . . . a rich , greedy , egotistical individual , motivated only by money and the desire to accumulate more and more of it , at the expense of the environment . . . the working poor and all whom they exploit . . . ”
I am a Republican . . .
I am none of those things . . . and I do n’t know any Republicans who are .
WHAT I AM . . . first and foremost , is a loving husband of some 52 plus years , the father of four and an American who ’s proud of his country .
. . and his country ’s heritage .
WHAT I AM . . . is the grandson of immigrants who risked everything , including their lives and those of their children , to escape tyranny in search of freedom .
WHAT I AM . . . is a man who grew up during the Depression and witnessed , first hand , the effects of the Stock Market crash and the soup lines that followed .
I watched as both my parents and grand parents , who had very little themselves , share what food they had with a half dozen other families , who had even less .
WHAT I AM . . . is someone who worked his way through college by holding down three and four jobs at a time and then used that education to build a better life .
WHAT I AM . . . is a husband who , at age 24 , started his own business for the “ privilege ” of working 60 , 70 and 80 hours a week , risking everything I had , including my health , in search of a better life for myself and my loved ones .
WHAT I AM . . . is a businessman whose blood , sweat and tears . . . and plenty of them . . . made it possible for me to provide a secure living , not only for my family and myself , but also for literally hundreds of my employees throughout the years .
Employees , who in turn , were able to buy their own homes , raise their own families and give back to their communities and their country .
WHAT I AM . . . is a man who believes in God ; a God who has blessed this country . . . and all for which it stands .
WHAT I AM . . . is someone who knows , if you doubt miracles exist in today ’s world , you need only to look into the face of those who received them . . . and the eyes of those who give them .
WHAT I AM . . . is an American who ’s proud that his President embraces a belief in God ; proud of a President who understands , as “ politically incorrect ” as it may be , there is evil in this world and for the security and safety of all freedom loving people everywhere , it must be confronted . . . and it must be defeated .
WHAT I AM . . . is an American who takes comfort in the knowledge that our President refuses to allow decisions concerning the very safety and security of this nation , to be governed by the political whims of foreign governments .
WHAT I AM . . . is tired of hearing from leading Democrats who see only negativity in America ; racism in her people ; class warfare in her society and “ political incorrectness ” in her character .
WHAT I AM . . . is a former democrat who now understands that it is the soldier and not the reporter that guarantees us our freedoms of press , speech and dissent .
WHAT I AM . . . is a man who believes in the sanctity of life .
A man who is repulsed by the pandering of the political left for votes , at the expense of the unborn .
WHAT I AM . . . is a husband and father who believes in the sanctity of marriage and the preservation of the family unit .
WHAT I AM . . . is a movie go - er who is repulsed by those insecure , socially inept , elementary thinking , ego - inflated “ entertainers ” who have appointed themselves “ experts ” in the fields of national security and geo-politics and then use their forum to attack this nation , its leaders and its actions . . . much to the delight and encouragement of our enemies .
WHAT I AM . . . is an American who understands the difference between “ censorship ” and “ choice ” .
Evidently , these individuals do not , because when these same “ celebrities ” receive public ridicule for their offensive actions , the first thing they yell is “ Censorship ! ” .
What they seem incapable of understanding is . . . the right of free speech and dissent is shared equally by those offended . . . as well as those who offend .
I support and will continue to support those films and performers whom I choose to . . . and refuse to support those I do n’t .
It is my right as an American . . . a right I will continue to enthusiastically exercise .
WHAT I AM . . . is a voter , tired of politicians , who , every time their voting records are subjected to public scrutiny , try to divert attention from their political and legislative failures by accusing their opponents of “ attack ads ” and “ negative campaigning ” . . . and the news media who allow them to get away with it .
WHAT I AM . . . is a Catholic who loves his God and his Faith . . . and who ’s been taught to respect all religions whose teachings are based in love , peace and charity .
As such , I am embarrassed and ashamed of those individuals , in both private and public life , whose decisions and actions are devoid of any sense of character or morals ; individuals who are only driven by what ’s best for them . . . rather than what ’s right . . . often times at the expense of many . . . including our national security .
WHAT I AM . . . is a realist who understands that the terrorist attack that murdered hundreds of innocent Russian children could have occurred here , in our heartland .
That ’s why I sincerely believe America needs now , more than ever , a President who sees with a clear and focused vision and who speaks with a voice when heard by both friend and foe alike , is understood , respected and believed .
WHAT I AM . . . is eternally grateful to Ronald Reagan for having the bravery to speak out against Communism and the courage of his convictions in leading the fight to defeat it ; and George W. Bush for the vision , courage , conviction and leadership he has shown in America ’s war on terrorism amidst both the constant and vicious , personal and political attacks both he and his family are made to endure .
WHAT I AM . . . is a human being , full of numerous faults and failures , but a man nonetheless , who , though not always successful , has continually strived to do “ what ’s right ” instead of “ what ’s easy ” .
A man who is challenging the religious leaders of all faiths , to not only preach to their congregations the fundamentals of “ what ’s right ” and “ what ’s wrong ” , but to also then hold them accountable for their actions in both the public and private sectors .
WHAT I AM . . . is disgusted with the Courts who , on one hand , call the murder of a pregnant woman a “ double homicide ” but then refer to the abortion of her baby as , “ pro-choice ” .
WHAT I AM . . . is someone deeply troubled by a political party which embraces a candidate whose primary “ leadership ” qualities center around his protesting of the Vietnam war and his labeling the honorable men and women who fought in it , ( 50,000 of whom gave their lives in that action ) , as rapists , and war criminals .
That same political party then stepped forward this year to block the appearance of a true Vietnam war hero , retired Admiral and former United States Senator , Jeremiah Denton , ( a man who spent seven years and seven torturous months in a North Vietnam prison ) , from speaking before an open session of the California legislature as part of that state ’s 4th of July celebration .
The reason Democrats gave for refusing to allow this American hero to speak before their state legislature was because of the “ conservative ” nature of his views .
As an American , that troubles me deeply . . . as well it should you .
WHAT I AM . . . is a man who feels the need to spend , $ 104,655.60 ( tax paid ) of his own money , to purchase this advertisement , in order to set the story straight .
Some may say this money would have been better spent feeding the world ’s poor .
At the risk of sounding self - serving , as an American and as a Republican , for the last six decades of my life , I have done exactly that . . . and more .
Following the examples of my parents and grand parents , I have used my earnings to feed the poor , shelter the homeless , provide housing for the elderly and medical care for the sick . . . and continue to do so . . . and I ’m not alone in that work .
WHAT I AM . . . is someone who is paying for this announcement , at my sole expense , in hopes of opening the eyes of those led blindly by ill - informed elements of our great nation , who , through either ignorance , or malicious intent , repeatedly attack and belittle those of us who belong to a political party that holds true to the belief , ” . . . the rights of the governed , exceed the power of the government ” .
For those interested , I am speaking only as a tax - paying individual who is in no way associated with The Republican National Committee , nor with any of its directors , or delegates .
WHAT I AM . . . is a man who understands , “ the American way of life ” is a message of self - empowerment for all .
WHAT I AM . . . is an American who is grateful that our nation gives each of us the opportunity of self - determination and the right to benefit from the fruits of self achievement .
WHAT I AM . . . is an American who wants to preserve that way of life for all who seek it .
WHAT I AM . . . is blessed to be an American . . . and proud to be Republican .

Decode Stela 3
A series of Maya hieroglyphs may look like just so many pretty pictures or symbols to you .
But they actually say something , of course , as Mayanists have known for some time ( see Time Line of Decipherment ) .
In this feature , you can actually " read " a passage of glyphs carved into an ancient Maya stela , or dedicatory stone monument .
You can both read the ancient Maya ( transcribed using the Roman alphabet ) and hear it spoken ( by Mayanist Barbara MacLeod ) as well as read the English translation .
Accompanying notes explain each glyph in detail .
You can also see the original stela and learn more about it .
Along the way , you 'll get a good taste of the language — and you 'll see just how important dates and numbers were to the Maya .
Enjoy !— Mark Van Stone

The case of Tracy Brooks who had down the years falsely accused five men of rape is a salutary tale ( link ) .
It not only serves as a great disservice to those women who are raped but again shines the spotlight into the way that the criminal justice system ' automatically ' believes a man is guilty .
What is also made worse is that a man , once charged , is named irrelevant as to whether he is found guilty .
It is too late for those who are found innocent or who eventually have the charges dropped against them , their names have been emblazoned across the media and the friends and work colleagues will never quite believe them .
Often the feminist fundamentalists will state that nothing can be in place that will out off women from coming forward if they have been raped .
Of course , that is true , but there is no evidence to state that by keeping a man 's identity secret , unless found guilty , would put women off from coming forward .
The current situation is a clear case of sexual discrimination against men and cannot be justified on moral , logical or rational terms .
The Government have looked at it but done nothing about it , no doubt because Harriet Harman QC MP sees it as an opportunity to attack and undermine men
This is one Law that has to be changed .
I do n't know how many of you realize that Ayn Rand 's science fiction classic , is actually only book 1 of a trilogy ?
Hardly anybody knows this , because she never got around to writing the missing middle volume .
She wrote book 1 in the series .
She wrote book 3 in the series , but did n't explicitly label it a sequel toshe and her agent marketed it as a stand - alone volume .
She never got around to writing the middle volume that bridges the two .
It 's probably because she found it too depressing , the way that Heinlein never got around to writing the missing volume in the Future History series that comes between " All You Zombies " and " If This Goes On . " for those of you who never read it , can be summarized entirely fairly as follows .
Unknown to our viewpoint characters at first , an inventor named John Galt has invented a " free energy " machine , a motor that runs on ambient static electricity and the Earth 's own inertia and puts out enough electricity in a fairly small unit to power almost anything , including vehicles , force field generators , energy weapons , even an invisibility cloak if you use a big enough unit .
He invented this while working at a company where his contract gave them rights to stuff he invented on the clock , like most professional engineers and inventors , but he assumed that as the inventor , he was entitled to all of the profits from this fabulous new invention .
The company 's management and other employees , though , saw just how much resentment would happen if one company owned the monopoly on an invention this valuable , and started making plans for how to invest some of the profits into charitable ventures , so they would n't get the whole thing taken away from them via eminent domain .
John Galt , outraged that anybody would even suggest that he or the company he worked for owed anything to the nation that provided his education , protected him from infectious disease outbreaks , protected him from Communist invasion , built the roads that got him to work each day , provided the police that kept him safe , and provided the court system that protected his property rights at all , sabotaged the Galt Engine , so nobody could have it .
Then he went further and , in a fit of offended pique , promised to " stop the motor of the world , " to kill 90 % or so of Earth 's population by intentionally wrecking the economy .
Which he then did .
How ?
By finding every other competent engineer or manager in the US and persuading them to be just as selfish as him , just as unwilling to pay back or protect their country ; he declared a covert " strike of the mind , " as he called it .
He hid them all in a secretive compound in the Rocky Mountains , protected by force field and invisibility cloak , and waited for the US economy to collapse , which , obligingly , it did -- because John Galt had carefully sabotaged the bridges and railroads that made it possible for fuel and seeds to make it from the coastal cities to inland farms , and make it possible for food grown on inland farms to make it to the coastal cities .
And as chaos was breaking out , he and his fellow inventors hijacked every radio transmitter in the US to broadcast his manifesto :
You all deserve to die , for asking us to pay you back even one nickel , because we are all so selfish we do n't consider any of the things you all paid for out of your taxes and that you did with your labor to have been at all helpful to us as entirely self - sufficient brilliant inventors and managers .
So die .
And that 's where the series is interrupted .
But from where the third book picks up , and by applying a little common sense , we can outline the main plot points , if not the characterizations , from the untitled middle volume , the one I 'm whimsically calling
When the previous book ran out , America was winding down to what was clearly going to be the last harvest , ever , and the Strikers were planning for the day that they , as the only people possessing any high tech or any capability of mass production of food or anything else , would ride out of their hidden Colorado fortress as humanity 's saviors .
They were pledging to themselves to build a new world based , as John Galt 's manifesto had promised all Americans , on the virtue of selfishness .
They assumed that a grateful ( or at least desperately needy ) and vastly reduced in number population would welcome them as liberators , chastened and having learned their lesson .
Except that we know from the third book that that 's not what happened , and anybody who knows human nature should have been able to predict that .
Outside the valley , the conversion to local subsistence farming and the work of scavenging the dead cities for any usable metal would have been rough .
No time or energy would have been available to save even minimal technology .
We 're looking at a collapse all the way back to ( at best ) early iron age levels , maybe even all the way back to the bronze age , and nobody will even have time to teach the next generation to read and write .
But one thing very clearly did happen , in every survivor 's village , and became world - wide policy as soon as even minimal travel and communication made it possible for the chiefs of the scattered villages of survivors began to reunite society into any kind of a civilization , and that is a fierce determination to make sure that the next generation remembered who had done this to them , and why they had done it .
They would have educated their children to remember the names and descriptions of every one of the hated Strikers who had personally murdered four and a half billion people for a political point .
And they would have educated their children that one idea , one idea in the Strikers ' twisted minds , had lead to those four and a half billion deaths , the greatest act of genocide in human history : selfishness .
How far did they go to eradicate selfishness ?
They went so far as tofrom the language .
Because she died without telling anyone , it 's not entirely clear howwould have ended .
We know that at some point , at least one of the Strikers does leave Galt Valley .
He built a high - tech home , stuffed it with a library and all the wonders of the Strikers ' science , and then ( apparently ) set out to make contact with the nearest survivors ' village , assuming that they 'd worship him as a god for his technological superiority , assuming they 'd cheerfully feed him and provide him with anything he wanted for the products of his labor .
And , rather obviously , they did what anybody would do : they executed him for crimes against humanity .
His technological redoubt was never found .
Did other Strikers meet the same fate , or are they all holed up in Galt Valley still ?
We 'll never know .
But that brings us to the book that would clearly have been relabeled once the trilogy was complete ... is actually the best book of the three .
And it 's a credit to Rand that she realized just how monstrous the real results of the Strike would be .
Many , many so - called Objectivists and Libertarians , who only read the first book , thought they were supposed to cheer for the Strikers , believed the Strikers ' personal delusion that the Strike , and the resulting mass genocide , would usher in a techno - libertarian paradise on earth .
No , inwe get a view of John Galt 's Earth from the viewpoint of someone who grew up in the next generation , never having known a technological world , knowing only a world in which selfishness is labeled the ultimate sin .
The massive die - off from John Galt 's strike has resulted in the rise of the most vicious and backwards and cruelly unfair totalitarian regime in human history .
And our nameless hero slowly has it dawn on him that the ruling council isafraid of selfishness that they 're retarding any attempt to restore human technological civilization , no matter how miserable and stunted low - tech life is , until they figure outway to integrate technological progress into their civilization without anybody being able to claim credit for it .
Which cannot possibly work .
Our nameless hero , having found working light bulbs and a working electrical system in the ruins of the city his farming town is built over , even offers to forgo personal credit for the discovery , offers to accept no credit for it at all .
But their paranoia and terror that he's a prospective future Striker pushes them to hound him to the point where in desperation he and his girlfriend flee the city into the uninhabited wasteland ... where they find the technological trove , and the library , left behind by the unnamed Striker at the end of He and his now wife settle down to raise children , to use the subsistence farming skills they learned from their own civilization to sustain them , to gather any other stragglers who escape the cities , and to stay out of sight until they find a way to overthrow the horribly dictatorial Councils that rule the world and lead it to a saner middle ground , one that ( presumably ) knows to watch out for civilization - wreckers like John Galt but that also knows that giving personal credit is a prerequisite for technological advance .
It is , if not an entirely happy ending , a hopeful one .
Oh , except for one thing .
I made up the whole bit about the second book .
I do n't think Ayn Rand was aware enough of the limitations of her philosophy for her to realize that the communo - primitivist dictatorship of not a techno - libertarian utopia , would be the inevitable outcome of a genocide of almost the entire human race by techno - libertarians .
Oops .
Never mind , then .
Sorry !
The only expert witness used in the case where the IFPI campaigned for The Pirate Bay to be blocked in Denmark , was previously employed by the IFPI .
Now working for an anti-piracy company , Kristian LÃ¸kkegaard used to work for a law firm serving the IFPI but the court did n't know this .
When a conflict of interest rears its head , it can cast a long shadow over someone ’s objectivity , or in the case of legal proceedings , jeopardize a whole case .
Yesterday we reported that a key player in The Pirate Bay case – a policeman – has been working at Warner Bros , one of the plaintiffs in the case .
Shocking , yes .
But what if there were two similar events , on subsequent days ?
Today it has been revealed by Computerworld that the expert witness – the ONLY expert witness – in the Danish Pirate Bay blocking case , was previously employed by the IFPI , a fact revealed through his Linked In social networking page .
Kristian Lakkegaard is now working for DtecNet Software , an anti-piracy company .
DtecNet Software originally stems from Antipiratgruppen ( Danish Anti-Piracy outfit ) and Johan Schlüter Law Firm , where several of the partners are co-owners of the internationally successful firm .
Kristian Lakkegaard had also been employed for two years at Johan Schlüter Law Firm , which has the IFPI as a client , something which many find shocking , like Morten Agervig Helles who represented Tele2 , the ISP ordered to block The Pirate Bay in Denmark .
“ I could n’t in my wildest dreams believe that they would use a witness that had previously been employed by them ” he said .
The court in Frederiksberg probably had no knowledge of that fact when it ordered Tele2 to block The Pirate Bay in February this year , however that does n’t change the fact that Lakkegaard had a conflict of interests .
Right now , the court does n’t wish to comment on this situation .
According to Lars Bo Langsted who is a lawyer and faculty - leader at Aalborg University , witnesses must be objective .
He says that there is a difference between a representative for one of the sides in a trial and an objective witness .
“ If you give testimony as an objective professional and not as a representative of one of the parts in the trial , then you give testimony as an independent expert .
In relation to that , it is of course very important that it is clear weather the person in question is capable of that or not . ”
In the interests of transparency , this information about previous employment should have been known to the court but it is nowhere to be found in the court documents .
Morten Agervig Helles , who represented Tele2 says this is also news to him : “ I did n’t know that .
No one told me .
Neither that he had interests in the case nor that he had been employed . ”
Kristian Lakkegaard said that he only appeared in the courtroom for very limited time : “ I do not remember how exactly it went , but normally the judge or a clerk asks who I am , what my background is , my employment and so on .
And then I answer those questions . ”
He says that because of his expertise he has been called as an witness in similar cases by Johan Schlüter Lawfirm .
“ I was n’t in the courtroom during the whole hearing , ” he said “ and I cant remember exactly which questions they asked .
But this is not something I want to try to hide or have tried to hide . ”

“ LNK Infotree ” ( LNK Infomedis ) is currently the largest TV sculpture in the world ( Guinness World Record ) .
It ’s using 2,903 individual television sets , spanning 3,135 sq metres ( 33,744.85 sq ft ) at the Open Air Museum in Vilnius , Lithuania .
I ’ve been there a couple of years ago and it looked really amazing .
It ’s currently closed for reconstruction but we can look at some older images .
A statue of Lenin lies in the middle of the labyrinth .
The sculpture symbolizes the absurdity of Soviet propaganda that for over half a century had been implanted in people ’s minds with the help of senseless TV .
All Lithuania has taken part in the creation of a labyrinth of television sets .
People from various Lithuanian towns donated old TV sets after an appeal from Europos Parkas was broadcast on LNK television .

It may become worse .
Soon you may have to watch their favorite television shows and YouTube videos , too , as they project them onto nearby walls or commuter - train seatbacks .
Pint - size digital projectors are in the works .
These devices , when plugged into cellphones and portable media players , will let consumers beam video content from their hand - held devices to the closest smooth surface  entertaining themselves , annoying their neighbors and possibly contributing to a new warning sign : No Projectors in This Area .
The microprojectors , still in prototype , use light - emitting diodes , lasers or a combination of the two to cast a display of up to 50 or 60 inches , or perhaps even wider , in darkened spaces and 7 to 20 inches or so when there is ambient light .
Digital projectors were once bulky .
These new models , though , are small enough to fit into the pocket of consumers who want a big - screen experience from a small - screen device .
Some of the models are expected to be on the market by year - end , or sooner .
Prices have yet to be announced .
Matthew S. Brennesholtz , an analyst at Insight Media , a marketing research firm in Norwalk , Conn. , says he thinks the projectors will initially cost about $ 350 , then quickly drop to less than $ 300 .
Like many denizens of teh Internets , I 'm a huge fan of Mr. Deity , the online satirical series of shorts ( usually around 5 minutes long ) about a silver - haired middle - aged deity -- reimagined as the ultimate Hollywood producer -- and his two sidekicks , Jesus and Larry ( not to mention his on - again , off - again relationship with Lucy , a.k.a. , Lucifer ) .
It 's clever , well - written , and filled with amusing one - offs .
Take this tossed - off bit from " Mr. Deity and the Really Big Favor , " when Mr. Deity receives a call from Larry , who 's currently in the 13th dimension overseeing the construction of the nascent universe .
Larry and the construction guys are wondering " how dark do you want to go with the dark matter ? "
Mr. Deity responds , " Take it all the way to void and then back off a scosch ... "
Dark matter was the topic du jour over the weekend at the APS April Meeting in St. Louis , which features several sessions on experimental searches for this elusive stuff .
Quick recap : the current model for the actual " stuff " in the universe calls for only about 4 % regular matter .
That would be every visible bit in the universe , from galaxies and stars to quarks and leptons , and everything in between .
The rest of the universe is comprised of the mysterious dark energy ( 73 % ) , which is causing the expansion of the cosmos to accelerate , and dark matter ( about 23 % ) .
Oh , and neutrinos might be 0.001 % of all the stuff in the universe .
There 's pretty strong indirect evidence of dark matter 's existence already , most dramatically seen in the now - famous ( among science geeks ) Bullet Cluster image ( see the Spousal Unit 's excellent description of what 's going in the image at right here ) .
But nobody really knows what this stuff actually is .
The two leading contenders are massive astrophysical compact halo objects ( MACHOs ) and weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) .
The former would be things like black holes , neutron stars , and brown dwarfs , plus any other similar objects that emit little or no radiation and therefore escape detection by our instruments .
MACHOs are still technically " normal " matter .
WIMPs would be something else entirely , a new type of matter that pretty much never ( or almost never ) interacts with regular matter -- and therefore is even harder to detect than MACHOs .
They only interact through the gravitational and weak nuclear forces .
Mr. Deity made the dark matter very dark indeed !
WIMPs seem to share certain qualities with neutrinos , often popularly referred to as " ghost particles " ( a term that makes at least one neutrino researcher I know grit his teeth in distaste ) because billions of them pass through our bodies every day unnoticed .
( John Updike even wrote a famous poem about them back in the 1950s , called " Cosmic Gall . " )
Like WIMPs , neutrinos interact only rarely with other subatomic particles , although they 're definitely a lot " chattier " than WIMPs , and scientists have gotten pretty good at finding them -- using gigantic vats of liquid and really big , sensitive detectors buried deep underground , for instance .
Perhaps that explains why many facilities and detectors currently studying neutrinos can also be used to search for WIMPs .
It 's dual - use technology for the cosmology crowd !
The big rumor buzzing around our St. Louis hotel is an expected announcement sometime in the coming week that the DAMA - LIBRA collaboration , housed in an underground laboratory in Gran Sasso , Italy , will report confirmation of an earlier , highly controversial 2000 experiment in which they claimed to have detected dark matter .
I missed all the hullabaloo eight years ago , since cosmological matters were n't my usual " beat , " but it 's not hard to find quite a bit of information on the controversy via Google .
I wo n't go into too much detail here , except to say that physicists were not convinced that the original DAMA experiment had detected a clear signal for dark matter .
Instead , they thought it was probably a systematic error stemming from the high degree of background noise associated with DAMA 's particular experimental approach : looking for a tiny signal variation in a sodium iodide detector over the course of a year , supposedly due to the motion of the Earth through the cosmic dark matter background .
The DAMA team vehemently disagreed , and a major battle ensued in the pages of the physics journals and associated trade press -- " major " for physics , anyway .
Judging from the collaboration 's current home page , some of them are still a little angry about the reception their finding received : the page bears a quote from " If , " by Rudyard Kipling : " If you can bear to hear the truth you 've spoken / twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools , ... you 'll be a Man my son . "
( Three guesses who the " knaves " might be ! )
In 2002 , a French underground experiment known as EDELWEISS ( or , as Jen - Luc Piquant phrases it , " Experience pour DEtecter Les Wimps En Site Souterrain " ) failed to confirm the result ; so did the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search ( CDMS ) experiment ( based in the Soudan Mine ) , which announced its null result in May 2004 .
DAMA -LIBRA is a re-running of the original experiment using the same basic set - up and technology -- in an attempt to repeat that first result , reproducibility being the heart of the scientific method .
I do n't know if the rumors are true about DAMA - LIBRA making a big announcement this week , and I 'm hardly qualified to pronounce any technical judgment even if they do .
But it became pretty clear to me after the April meeting press conference on searching for dark matter that DAMA - LIBRA will have a hard sell facing them if such an announcement does transpire : physicists are still inclined to be skeptical .
In fact , the general consensus among the featured speakers -- Tom Shutt of Case Western University , Jody Cooley of the ongoing CDMS collaboration , and Juan Collar of the University of Chicago -- is that any new result from DAMA - LIBRA will have to be confirmed by other dark matter experiments , using different ( but complementary ) approaches , before anyone can definitively conclude that we have directly detected dark matter -- whether it be WIMPs or something else entirely .
To that end , they 're using liquid noble gases , solid state devices using germanium and silicon crystals cooled to cryogenic temperatures , and even resurrecting bubble chambers and pressing them into the service of the search for dark matter .
And they 're going deep underground for their searches , to filter out all the " background noise " from radiation emitted by other particles -- you know , like cosmic rays .
The DAMA experiments , among others , use a " scintillating material " to detect atoms being kicked around by a WIMP , which would generate very faint light pulses that would then be detected .
Noble gases are excellent materials for this purpose .
( If any physicists would care to weigh in on why this is the case , feel free to do so .
I think it has something to do with the fact that noble gases naturally block the passage of many radioactive particles , which could interfere with detecting dark matter signals . )
Shutt 's Large Underground Xenon ( LUX ) experiment will use xenon .
Xenon is the heaviest noble gas and turns to a liquid at - 100 degrees Celsius .
The detector will have both a large pool of liquid xenon , and a layer of the gaseous version just above it .
Whenever a WIMP strikes a xenon atom , it will emit a flash of light , which will be recorded by photosensitive detectors .
That 's step one .
But since electrons get bumped off the atom at the time of impact , they will be pulled through an electric field out of the liquid and into the gaseous layer , emitting a second flash of light when they encounter the gaseous xenon atoms .
Something about the specific ratio between those two flashes of light will comprise a telltale " signal " for a collision between a xenon atom and a WIMP ( as opposed to a neutrino or other type of particle , like those pesky cosmic rays ) .
The signal will be different in part because a WIMP should strike the nucleus of an atom , whereas cosmic rays or neutrinos would strike the electrons on the nucleus ' surface .
This will change the " recoil " behavior ( similar to what happens during the first break in a game of pool ) of the atom post - impact -- ergo , it is a unique " signature . "
Interesting historical side note : LUX is housed in the abandoned Homestake gold mine in Lead , South Dakota , home to the very same cavern where physicist Ray Davis built an experiment that gave rise to the solar neutrino problem in the 1950s .
( Neutrinos were first detected by Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan .
The photo below shows Davis taking a dip in the pool of water that surrounded his neutrino detector : 100,000 gallons of a chlorine solution housed 4850 feet below the ground .
Jen -Luc opines that this is probably more of Ray Davis than anyone cared to see , but I think the photo's kinda charming . )
Meanwhile , in another region deep in America 's Heartland , CDMS has moved its experimental headquarters to the Soudan Underground Laboratory , in an abandoned iron mine some 700 meters below ground in Eli , Minnesota .
The site also houses the MINOS ( Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search ) facility , which is investigating the mystery of neutrino oscillations .
But Cooley and cohorts are more interested in the dark matter .
As cold as it gets in Minnesota during the winter , joked Cooley , it 's still not cold enough for the cryogenics of their experiment .
The germanium and silicon crystals they use are about the size of hockey pucks , according to Cooley , and are then cooled down to about 50 milliKelvins ( i.e. , " really , really cold " ) .
Cooley suggested we try to envision the crystal lattice structure as being held together by springs ( rather than the traditional model of rigid posts ) connecting the individual atoms .
When a WIMP passes through a crystal , it supposedly sets off tiny vibrations whenever it bump into an atom , which can be detected via a layer of tungsten - aluminum metal .
The metal is superconducting at very cold temperatures , but the vibrations in the crystal resulting from the WIMP - atom collision .
Of course , they also sense vibrations from other sources , such as cosmic rays , hence the location of the experiment deep underground to use the Earth as a kind of shield .
CDMS also uses lead and copper for additional shielding to cut down on the problem of background noise ( which plagued the DAMA collaboration ) .
Because , in Cooley 's words , WIMPs are n't all that chatty ( unlike cosmic rays ) , even quieter than neutrinos , and are thus hard to " hear " over the usual noisy subatomic " hubbub . "
CDMS is pretty darn sensitive .
Last month , Cooley 's team announced some intriguing new results that apparently set an upper limit on certain key parameters , thereby excluding several of the numerous theoretical models that have been proposed for where the dark matter would likely be seen .
It 's the best upper limit achieved thus far ; any model that predicts values above that can be safely excluded " because we would have seen it . "
And they did n't .
( The actual numbers , for those who care , are something like a mass of 60 GeV / c < 2 > , with a size of 4.4 x 10 <- 44 > cm < 2 > .
The size is important because that 's what determines the level of " chattiness , " i.e. , how much / often the WIMPs interact with ordinary matter . )
The detectors are now being upgraded for even more sensitive experimental measurements in 2009 .
Over at the University of Chicago , Collar is taking a very different approach , resurrecting the relatively old technology of bubble chambers to search for dark matter .
His project is called the Chicagoland Observatory for Underground Particle Physics ( COUPP ) experiment , located 350 feet underground in a tunnel on the Fermilab site .
Bubbles chambers were nearly extinct in high - energy physics labs before Collar hit upon the notion of using them to search for dark matter .
( They 're great as neutrino detectors , too . )
While the basic technology might be old , Collar insisted , " This is not your daddy 's bubble chamber . "
COUPP's " detector " is basically a glass jar filled with a liter or so of a fire - extinguishing liquid ( iodotrifluoromethane ) -- a simple bubble chamber , and a refreshingly inexpensive approach to this very fundamental problem in cosmology .
When a WIMP hits a nucleus of one of those atoms , it triggers an evaporation of a small amount of that liquid , producing a tiny bubble .
It 's initially too tiny to see , but it grows , and that growth can be recorded with digital cameras .
Once the bubbles reach about one millimeter in size , the COUPP scientists can study the images in earnest , looking for telltale statistical variations between photographs .
Ideally , this enables them to distinguish whether a bubble resulted from background radiation , or from a dark matter particle .
Like the CDMS collaboration , Collar 's group has succeeded in placing some fundamental limits on certain properties for WIMPs -- and if you combine that with the findings of EDELWEISS and CDMS , it does n't look good for DAMA .
But time will tell .
Next on the agenda for COUPP is to increase the detector 's sensitivity by increasing the amount of liquid from one liter to around 30 liters .
( One assumes this helps because there are that many more atoms with which to encounter the occasional WIMP . )
Collar has also just installed a new compact neutrino detector ( germanium - based ) 330 feet below ground in the sewers of Chicago ( renting this unusual lab space for the city -- apparently Chi-Town has one of the longest systems of tunnels every built , in its case , to control flooding ) .
The design has been modified to detect not neutrinos , but WIMPs .
So for all intents and purposes , bubble chambers are back , baby !
Talk about a stunning comeback .
Still , Collar and the others emphasized that " there is no perfect dark matter detector out there . "
Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses .
Which is why it 's highly unlikely that one single experiment will conclusively " demonstrate " the first detection of dark matter .
" One day lots of lines [ of data ] from all these different experiments will cross , " explained Collar -- and that will constitute what a criminal lawyer might call a preponderance of evidence verifying direct detection .
" We all weigh in from different directions " and compare results , according to Shutt .
That includes upcoming experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN , which will look for " missing energy " in its collisions as a telltale signal for direct detection of the dark matter .
It 's going to make for a one hell of a tough call by the Nobel Prize nominating committee one of these years -- because one of the reasons the competition is so fierce , is that the first group to achieve that pivotal first detection is pretty much a shoo - in for an all - expenses - paid trip to Stockholm .
I guess if all else fails .
Mr. Deity could step in as arbitrator .

Valve Reveals Final Team Fortress 2 Medic Weapons
In addition to the known crit- increasing gun " The Critzcrieg , " the remaining two unlockable medic weapons were also available for hands - on time .
Dubbed " The Blutsaugher " and " The Ubersaw , " they will serve as replacements for the medic 's standard syringe and bonesaw , respectively .
The weapons will be earned through a new achievement system , and equipped through a loadout menu .
Below you can check out Valve 's official descriptions for the weapons .
For more , check out our impressions of the new content and media of the fantastic Goldrush map as well as our interview with Valve 's Robin Walker and the 36 new Medic - specific achievements .
The Blutsaugher
For players that earn one third of the 36 new medic achievements , they will be given a new syringe gun .
Called " The Blutsaugher , " this new weapon no longer has the ability to score critical hits against an opponent .
Instead it will draw health from enemies each time a syringe hits .
Especially useful as a weapon to retreat away from the fight while staying alive .
The Critzcrieg
Once a medic has earned two thirds of the achievements , they will be granted " The Critzcrieg . "
This new medigun uses its ubercharge not for invulnerability , but to give its recipient 100 % chance to fire critical ordinance .
Medics and the player they are charging need to be careful though , because as much fun as it is to fire critical rockets as fast as you can , the other team will see what you 're up to and try to put a quick stop to your plan .
The Ubersaw
For the determined medic that has earned all 36 of the new achievements , they will find themselves the proud owner of " The Ubersaw , " which will take damage done in melee attacks and convert it directly to ubercharge .
Four hits with this new weapon will fully charge whatever medigun the medic has equpped .
I guess we all know what the M in M Theory stands for now !
Heyoooo !
( god I 'm tired )
See you tomorrow .

We ’re the name behind successful brands in specialist consumer and B2B sectors including : technology , gaming & entertainment , music , creative & photography , home interest , education and television .
Every year we attract millions of consumers to our brands ’ websites , magazines , events and social spaces .
Apple announced a rebranding of their .
Mac service earlier this morning .
It ’s now called MobileMe and features online versions of Mail , iCal , and Address Book , so you can access your email , calendars , and contacts ( watch a demo ) from any PC .
Any PC not running IE 6 , that is .
From the email sent out to .
Mac subscribers just a few minutes ago :
To use the new web applications , make sure you have one of these browsers : Safari 3 , Internet Explorer 7 , or Firefox 2 or later .
There ’s still a significant number of PCs out there running IE 6 , usually corporate machines that need to access intranets or other web apps that only work with that browser .
A quick look at the stats for Basecamp ’s marketing site shows that 31 % of all IE users are using version 6 .
So it ’s interesting that MobileMe is the first major web application ( that I know of , at least ) that ’s dropped IE 6 support completely .
It ’s a gutsy move , since Apple ’s billing it as a way to access your data from anywhere .
And I ’m hoping it ’s the beginning of a trend .
IE 6 is definitely the most painful browser for us to support – it ’s seven years old and does n’t even fully support the CSS 1.0 standard created in 1996 .
Microsoft ’s done an incredibly poor job of getting users to upgrade .
It looks like it ’s going to take pressure from big apps like MobileMe to seal the deal .
I 've been blitzed with stories all week about what is driving oil to $ 135 per barrel .
Most of what I 've seen are soundbites and short blurbs from the talking heads known as pundits .
Numbers are rare , making it hard to discern fact from fiction .
In this case , there seem to be three prevailing theories :
The first is that supply is failing to meet demand , or will in the near future .
The second theory is that a weak dollar buys less oil .
The third is that speculation in oil futures have rendered supply and demand less relevant .
One thing in particular from a short Reuters article caught my attention : " Crude oil prices rocketed to record highs above 135 dollars on Thursday , driven by growing concerns that energy supplies will fail to meet demand , analysts said . " ( emphasis mine )
Those four words - " driven by growing concerns " - are enough to convince me that speculation is playing some role in rising oil prices .
Markets are often driven by rumor , and like all rumors , there 's usually little substance to the ones that sway markets .
The question then becomes how much substance is there behind these " growing concerns " of an energy crunch ?
Supply / Demand & Peak Oil
On May 22 , the Treasury and Energy Secretaries both publicly stated they believe rising oil prices are being caused by supply problems .
The House of Representatives passed a bill two days earlier to sue OPEC for limiting supplies and price setting .
Goldmann Sachs predicted on May 5 that prices could reach $ 200 per barrel over the next two years .
I 've been all over the Energy Information Administration 's site and can tell you with confidence :
There is no shortage of oil !
There is n't expected to be a shortage of oil in either the short - or long - term , according to EIA predictions .
In their May 2008 Short Term Energy Outlook , consumption is projected to go down in the US for 2008 , and both national and global inventories are expected to grow as supply is ( barely ) meeting demand through 2009 .
The long term outlook , as stated in their 2007 International Energy Outlook , says , " In the high price case , oil prices are projected to be $ 100 per barrel in 2030 ( $ 157 per barrel on a nominal basis ) . "
In fact , the supply / demand picture looks good enough that a law was just signed to halt shipments of oil to the national reserve , which is 97 % full .
The theory of peak oil is being thrown around as well .
I admit to not being an expert on the subject , but as I understand it , this is the idea that we 'll have a Malthusian catastrophe because our dependence on oil was n't mitigated twenty years before peak production .
However , there 's little agreement on when peak production occurred - or if it even has yet .
The reasoning and logic behind this theory seem flawed to me .
It requires one to accept the premises that no further oil fields will ever be tapped anywhere , that advances in technology will never make extraction or refinement more efficient then they are today , that energy alternatives will never be found or switched to , and that current trends in population growth and economics will continue as they have for decades .
Before oil , this country was dependent on coal and whale oil - when is the last time you used a coal stove or fired up that whale - oil lamp ?
On top of all that , focusing on the finite nature of one resource fails to address the true problem : over - population in a closed system where all of the resources are finite .
I do n't entirely dismiss " peak oil " theorists .
I find their arguments about minor disruptions in supply having inordinate effects on economies , due to those economies ' critical dependence on oil , particularly compelling .
I have no doubt that if we do n't start seriously looking for energy alternatives ( with an effort on the order the moon mission ) , their worst scenarios have a high probability of occurring .
Yet , the supply numbers simply do n't support the idea that we 've already hit global peak production , so this theory 's effect on oil pricing should be minimal .
At least it would be in an open and free market , where the truth would come out before a rumor caused such a large rise in price .
Free Press and Public Knowledge love to lob bombshells at ISPs .
Free Press was a big backer of the FCC complaint against Comcast 's traffic management system for dealing with P2P uploads , and the two groups have now issued a new report ( PDF ) that takes aim at a new ISP practice : selling user Internet data to advertisers .
The report calls out NebuAd , which recently began a high - profile partnership with cable operator Charter , and it does n't mince words .
The NebuAd system " commandeers users ' Web browsers , " makes use of a " browser exploit , " and operates " by using what is effectively a classic man - in - the - middle attack . "
Robert Topolski , a technology consultant for both groups , prepared the report .
Instead of taking a wide - ranging look at the NebuAd system or digging deep into potential illegal activity under the Wiretap Act , Topolski confines himself to looking at the system by which NebuAd gear places various tracking cookies on user machines .
NebuAd works its targeted advertising magic by partnering with ISPs and installing a box in their network .
The box examines inbound and outbound traffic from all users , and it builds a highly - targeted profile for each Internet user by taking a look at the sites that people visit and the keywords displayed there .
These profiles are then used by NebuAd to insert relevant advertising into web pages that have elected to use to the NebuAd network ( NebuAd does not override ads displayed on sites that are not part of its advertising network ) .
To do all of this , NebuAd relies on a set of tracking cookies that are placed on each machine .
Such cookies are pretty standard fare in the web advertising world and are n't themselves of much note , but Topolski's report takes issue with the way that the cookies are placed onto people 's machines .
A subscriber to Wide Open West ( WOW ! ) gave Topolski remote access to his machine , and Topolski then verified that WOW 's NebuAd system was planting its own cookies when users visited Google and Yahoo , among other sites .
This could n't normally happen , since neither Google to Yahoo serves up NebuAd tracking cookies and NebuAd is not a partner to either firm .
After examining the TCP / IP packet data more closely , Topolski concluded that the NebuAd box was simply appending its cookies to the HTML code served up by Google and Yahoo .
To do this , the box creates a new packet and forges the same IP address and port number of the Google or Yahoo server that just sent data to the user .
In addition , it uses TCP 's ACK and SEQ system to " prevent the [ user 's ] system from rejecting the forged packet . "
This extra packet carries a bit of JavaScript data not actually served up by the sites in question ; the code directs the browser to visit NebuAd - related sites in order to grab a cookie .
This is the basis for Topolski's statements that " NebuAd 's code injected into another 's page source is a cross - site exploit ( XSS ) and the subsequent behavior of loading cookies it normally would not load is a browser hijack .
NebuAd accomplishes its XSS by using what is effectively a classic man - in - the - middle attack . "
Deleting the cookies in question simply leads the system to send them again on future visits to various web sites , though NebuAd says that it respects opt - out requests .
In a statement sent to Ars Technica , NebuAd expressed disappointment with the " misleading characterization " of its system .
The company stresses that it uses standard tracking cookies , but when it comes to the details of how these cookies are placed on people 's machines , it says only that it uses " industry - standard techniques and that cookie code " is clearly demarcated outside of and does not modify any publisher code . "
As the question at issue , whether NebuAd uses its boxes to " fake out " users and slip third - party cookies onto their machines by forging packet information — well , that 's not addressed .
Also not addressed is the far more important question of whether this entire system is legal .
Such concerns have been raised on both sides of the Atlantic , since wiretapping rules might seem to prohibit this interception of traffic on an opt - out basis .
In the US , such a system may also run afoul of the Communications Act , which generally requires that this type of data collection can only be done with " prior written or electronic assent of the subscriber . "
That was the basis for a bipartisan letter sent to Charter earlier this month from the two ranking members on the House Telecommunications Subcommittee .
When both Ed Markey ( D - MA ) and Joe Barton ( R - TX ) think your program should be halted until Congress can take a look at it , that 's a pretty good sign that the political resistance around these kind of schemes could be stiff , at least until they are fully opt-in .
Bolton : Israel will attack Iran before next President sworn in Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday June 23 , 2008
|
Print This Email This John Bolton , a former United Nations ambassador appointed by President George W. Bush , has predicted that the state of Israel will attack Iran 's nuclear sites before the next US president is sworn in .
In an interview with UK's The Telegraph , Bolton said the Arab world would be ' pleased ' at news of such an attack .
" It [ the reaction ] will be positive privately , " he said .
" I think there 'll be public denunciations but no action . "
However , Bolton panned the idea that an attack on Iran would be carried out by American forces , stating : ... " the administration has essentially given up that possibility .
I do n't think it 's serious any more .
If you had asked me a year ago , I would have said I thought it was a real possibility .
I just do n't think it 's in the cards . "
The ' optimal window , ' states Bolton , would be between the elections on November 4 and the January 20 , 2009 inauguration .
" My judgment is they would not want to do anything before our election because there 's no telling what impact it could have on the election , " he is quoted as saying .
" An Obama victory would rule out military action by the Israelis because they would fear the consequences given the approach Obama has taken to foreign policy .
... With McCain they might still be looking at a delay . "
READ THE REST

`` America , this is our moment ’’ , stated Barack Obama on June 3 after winning enough delegates to become the presumed presidential nominee for the Democratic Party .
Obama becomes the first African American in the history of the country to be nominated by one of the ruling parties .
It happened on the evening of June 3 as the final two primaries occurred in Montana and South Dakota , where he and his main opponent New York Senator Hillary Clinton won one state each .
* * *
For more on Obama click here
* * *
Obama ’s has won 2154 delegates as of June 4 .
It includes delegates won in direct - vote primaries , state caucuses and the pledges of ``super delegates ’’ .
It put him over the 2118 delegates needed to capture the nomination .
Obama will not officially win the nomination until the delegates vote in August at the Democratic Party convention in Denver , Colorado .
The presidential election is in November , where the winner is elected by an electoral college of delegates based on popular votes in each state , not the country as a whole .
( Al Gore in 2000 won the national popular vote but lost to Republican George Bush with fewer electoral votes . )
Hillary Clinton
Hillary Clinton , US senator from New York and former first lady , conceded to Obama on June 7 .
She does n’t have the delegates to win but still argues that she is the best choice to win the White House in November .
Her supporters are pushing Obama to pick her as his running mate for vice - president .
Clinton ’s run was historic too , as the first female candidate in serious contention for the presidency .
She won nearly as many popular votes and delegates as Obama .
Many of Clinton ’s most fervent backers were older women who grew up in the feminist revolution of the 1960s and 1970s .
They hoped she would be the first female president in US history .
Women first won the right to vote in the United States in 1920 .
Obama and Clinton tapped the deep anger of the US people against the rightist presidency of George Bush and vice - president Dick Cheney , who have reshaped much of US domestic and foreign policy during their eights years in power .
The invasion of Iraq was part of the neoconservatives ’ plan to bring about a modern - day version of colonial rule in the Middle East — with Israel as the Western outpost and with permanent US military bases in Iraq and other Arab countries to protect their oil interests and put down nationalist rebellions .
The September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack gave them the opening to topple a hated dictator , impose their rule and launch their plans .
John McCain , the likely Republican nominee for president , supports that goal ( which so far is a near complete disaster ) and pledges a long - term presence in Iraq .
McCain is a strong supporter of imperial ``democracy ’’ — a neocolonialism policy not only for the Middle East but the entire world .
Why historic ?
Obama , while backing US world domination , sees the invasion and occupation of Iraq as provoking more nationalist resistance and thus undermining the overall strategic objective of US imperialism .
He also rejects the extremist US domestic policies that have primarily benefited the wealthy 1 per cent .
He supports an expanded economic safety net and abortion rights .
Bush and McCain do n’t .
McCain ’s attacks on Obama must be seen in that context .
He says Obama is too inexperienced to be president , pointing to Obama ’s refusal to support the US invasion of Iraq and its current occupation .
The significance of Obama ’s electoral victory has little to do with his political positions or the reality that he will be the candidate of one of the two major ruling capitalist parties .
The Democratic Party , like the Republican Party , stands behind the mission of US imperialist domination of the world .
The differences between Obama and Clinton were narrow , with the exception of the Iraq war .
Obama in 2002 , then a state politician in Illinois , opposed the war ; Senator Clinton voted for it , and refused to repudiate that vote after it became known the war was based on the lies of the Bush administration .
The differences between the Democratic and Republican parties are more about tactics to keep the US as the only world power with military basses , and plans to expand NATO and other Cold War alliances , around the world .
The real concerns are not just Islamic fundamentalists , Iran and Syria , but a resurgent Russia and China .
Obama and McCain agree on the containment of Russia and China , and the objective of imperial ``democratic ’’ rule and modern - day neocolonial domination of countries like Iraq and Afghanistan .
The tactical differences , however , are wide .
Obama recognises that for the US to keep its superpower status and support it must return to the bipartisan US foreign policy that existed for decades — one based on traditional diplomacy and a more balanced policy toward friends and foes .
The Bush - Cheney policies have isolated the US from many countries in the Middle East and other Third World countries .
The al Qaeda Islamic fundamentalist network is stronger today than after the September 11 terrorist attack .
The resistance to foreign occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan , and to the pro-US government in Pakistan , is growing stronger .
The influence of anti-US Islamic groups and nationalist forces in many countries is expanding .
The aggressive US hostility toward Hamas , Hezbollah and Iran , and total uncritical support of Washington ’s gendarme Israel has weakened US policy in the region .
The gains won by Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza are indications of declining US influence .
Even Israel sees the failures of current US policy .
After Bush recently spoke to its parliament ( the Knesset ) about those appeasing the enemy ( an indirect attack on Obama ’s support for diplomacy without conditions ) , Israel decided to open talks with its arch - enemy Syria .

Obama ’s expected nomination is historic clearly not because of the pro-imperialist policies of the two major parties .
It is historic because only white men have ever served as president .
Obama , as a representative of an oppressed racial group that was forged out of the slave trade , slavery and legal racism , and whose father is from Kenya , resonates widely .
Segregation is still in the memory of millions of southern Blacks .
It took until 1967 before the US Supreme Court allowed Blacks and whites to legally marry .
It took a massive civil rights movement in the 1960s to adopt turning - point civil rights ( 1964 ) and voting rights ( 1965 ) laws .
What excites the vast majority of African Americans is that one of their own could be elected president .
The reality of past racism and unimaginable success is why Barack Obama ’s nomination is historic and significant .
What it does n’t mean
Obama ’s success has its limitations in terms of what it means for African Americans ’ future , and for all working people .
The end of legal racism in the 1960s did not end racial discrimination .
The vast majority of African Americans and other oppressed minorities still suffer from that institutional discrimination .
It is why unemployment , education rights and home ownership are significantly lower for African Americans than for whites .
Many gains such as affirmative action programs and school integration have been rolled back .
Net wealth for African Americans and others who suffered such historic discrimination is also much smaller than for white working people .
At the same time , a new Black upper and middle class have formed since the 1970s .
That middle class — families like Barack and Michelle Obama 's — do attend the best universities , live in the better neighbourhoods and believe it is possible to be a CEO or president .
After recognising the historic meaning of his nomination — that a Black man can know get the spot and possibly become president of the most powerful country in the world — sharpens the political discussion and debates along class lines .
It is no longer just about race .
Obama ‘s program is pro-big business .
He backs the neocolonial foreign policy of his party , which may be ``milder ’’ than Bush - Cheney ’s in tone but is nevertheless a neo-colonial policy toward enemies of the US .
Obama will not deviate from the ruling - class strategy or policy .
He will make some cosmetic and symbolic changes to the openly religion - driven neoconservative policies of Bush - Cheney .
But in the final analysis , Obama cannot make the fundamental changes necessary to improve the lives of the average African American , Latino American , Asian American and white American citizens .
( Immigrants and undocumented workers do n’t exist for either major party candidate . )
For African Americans it is pure pride to have the opportunity to vote for a Black person for president .
Many older Blacks still remember when legal segregation was the law of the land in most southern states .
It does n’t matter to them if Obama ’s polices befit few in the Black community .
At the same time , the relative social progress that made an Obama candidacy possible is the fact that most young people , of all ethnic groups and races , do n’t see it as odd that a Black , woman or non-white can be elected president .
They ask , `` Why not ?’’.
Minor parties ’ role – McKinney and Nader
The minor progressive and left political parties , in that context , can play an important role in the debates over the next five months .
While millions of young people and African Americans have been galvanised by Obama ’s candidacy — tens of thousands attend his rallies — the left and progressive forces who oppose his basically neocolonial and neoliberal policies should identify with the concerns for change and embrace those supporters ’ hopes , while explaining why a break with the two major parties is necessary for working people to elect a government that genuinely represents their interests .
The Obama phenomenon as it's been called is significant because it taps real anger and hopes .
It should be embraced in a constructive and critical manner .
It is the only way to win support from those who become disillusioned in the future to consider alternative views when and if Obama wins the presidency .
The aim is to engage and embrace ; it is to help move those activists towards independent politics .
The Green Party 's likely presidential nominee Cynthia McKinney ( a former Democratic congress member from the state of Georgia ) and independent candidacy of Ralph Nader are important .
It allows those who reject the two major parties on progressive grounds to discuss and offer radical solutions .
Both campaigns speak in support of social movements and why the issues of war and peace will not be possible under an Obama or McCain presidency .
What is lacking today are militant social movements that can push the government to adopt reforms that benefit the economic and social interests of the working class .
There is no activist labour movement in the US .
Today the trade unions are in retreat , suffering setbacks and defeats especially in the manufacturing sectors ( auto ) and transportation ( airlines ) .
There are weak campaigns in defence of civil rights , women ’s rights , gay rights , environmental issues and to protect other social gains .
Even the anti-war movement against the occupation of Iraq and the possible US war against Iran are relatively small even though a majority of people in the Unied States now oppose the reasons given to invade Iraq .
Obama ’s next step
What happens next in the Democratic and Republican party races for president is of interest to people around the world because the US is the only superpower .
It has military forces stationed in scores of countries .
It threatens its enemies with more wars , including the use of nuclear weapons .
Now that Obama has the nomination he will be judged not simply as the first African American candidate but on his political positions , vision and objectives to turn around the economy and end the wars overseas .
No matter what he doses or says , it will not change how Blacks will probably vote .
The nationalist sentiment is strong .
It ’s why 90 per cent plus of all African Americans voted for Obama during the Democratic Party primaries ( an unprecedented figure ) and will do so again , including the few African American Republicans .
The white backlash
Obama does face a unique challenge .
To win he must overcome the nearly 20 per cent of white voters who say they will never vote for an African American for president ( down from 80 per cent a generation ago ) .
Polls have failed in many elections to show this negative racial factor .
It is clear that Hillary Clinton ’s supporters used it to win many southern states where lower - paid whites tended to support her over Obama .
She and most pundits called these white bigots ``blue - collar Americans ’’ ( blue - collar workers who are Black , Asian or Latino were simply not mentioned ) .
Overall , however , Obama did win a majority of white working people in many other states outside of the old Jim Crow segregated South .
While race matters , it is n’t like it used to be .
Latino and Asian Americans were more divided on Obama ’s campaign , reflecting historical contradictions used by the ruling power structures to divide minorities against each other .
But again , Obama won many younger Asians , Latinos and other ethnic groups to his campaign as a candidate representing change .
The contradictions of US politics remain .
There is n’t a ``colorblind or non-racial society ’’ that conservatives pretend exists as a way not to support special programs for oppressed minorities .
It also applies to gender ; many men and women say they would never vote for a woman as president .
Historic change
June 3 was an historic date .
It should be acknowledged as it reflects genuine positive changes in US civil society .
The problems of economic recession and wars do n’t diminish its significance .
The change , while primarily symbolic and not fundamental , does show how the capitalist system is able to continuously adapt and incorporate new social groups into its leadership ( previously all - white male ) structure , without undermining its ability to rule .
AOMORI , Japan ( Reuters ) - Energy officials from five top consumer nations urged producers to step up investment on Saturday , a day after crude ’s biggest surge ever , but they offered no new ideas on how to deal with record prices and remained divided on fuel subsidies .

Japan , the United States , China , India and South Korea -- who together guzzle nearly half the world ’s oil -- said that they had agreed on the need for greater transparency in energy markets and more investment by consumers and producers both , while stopping short of calling on OPEC to pump more crude today .
But a call from the United States for an end to heavy price subsidies that protect many Asian drivers from soaring costs fell on deaf ears , as China and India said they could only raise domestic rates gradually in view of their fragile economies .
On Sunday the full Group of Eight energy ministers will meet amid unprecedented volatility in the oil market and growing public discontent over governments ’ failure to soften the blow , which worsened with Friday ’s more - than - $ 10 surge to a record $ 139 .
Energy Secretary Sam Bodman pointed part of the blame at cheap fuel in Asia , where fast - growing economies and low prices have helped drive oil ’s explosive six - year rally .
“ We know demand is increasing because a lot of nations are still subsidizing oil , which ought to stop , ” Bodman said .
But India ’s ambassador later told Reuters it was unrealistic to abandon controls that help protect its 1.1 billion people .
“ We as a developing nation are not in a position to completely do away with ... subsidies , ” said Hemant Krishnan Singh , who is standing in for the oil minister at the meetings .
India followed Taiwan , Indonesia and Sri Lanka in raising domestic fuel prices this week with only its second increase in two years , but analysts said the 10 percent hike was unlikely to have an impact unless rates were allowed to rise faster .
China , the world ’s second - largest oil consumer , has raised pump rates only once since mid-2006 , increasing them by 10 percent in November , and analysts see few signs of action soon with policymakers focused on taming inflation .
“ We still have some weak industries such as agriculture , the taxi industry and the public transportation sector , ” said Zhang Guobao , chief of China ’s State Energy Bureau .
China has long said it aims to allow resource prices to rise , but is now even more loath to do so as it fights inflation at a near 12 - year high .
China spends around $ 25 billion a year to subsidize such things as oil products , natural gas , electricity and gas , while India spends around $ 20 billion a year , a Japan trade official said , citing International Energy Agency ( IEA ) figures .
“ SHOCKING ” VOLATILITY
Oil prices rocketed more than $ 10 to a new high above $ 139 a barrel on Friday , taking this year ’s gains to 44 percent and continuing a rally that has seen prices rise sevenfold since 2001 as investors see output struggling to keep pace with demand .
Bodman warned the world to brace for worse to come , conceding there were no immediate answers .
“ It ’s a shock , but if you look at the rate of oil production globally , it has been 85 million barrels a day for three years in a row ” while demand is rising , Bodman told a news conference .
“ There are few things we can do short term . ”
He also said that increased regulation was not the answer to bringing prices down , despite mounting pressure from U.S. lawmakers to step up oversight of energy markets in the hopes of deterring the flood of new investors and speculators that some blame for inflating food and fuel prices .
The United States , Japan and South Korea -- all members of the IEA -- also urged China and India to work more closely with the IEA as they develop their strategic oil reserves , which Western nations fear they may use to try to influence prices .
Record oil prices have triggered protests across Europe , pushed airlines into the red and forced five Asian countries to cut fuel subsidies , intensifying price pressures .
World leaders are fighting an inflation battle on two flanks , having met earlier this week to seek a solution to the surge in food commodity prices that threatens starvation for millions .
The meetings in Aomori will set the stage for the G8 leaders ’ summit , to be held on Japan ’s northernmost island of Hokkaido on July 7 - 9 , where Tokyo is expected to press for a commitment to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .

Corruption is described as a disease in Russian society
Corrupt Russian officials are creaming off about $ 120bn ( £ 61 bn ) a year - the equivalent of a third of the national budget , a senior prosecutor has said .
The country 's new President , Dmitry Medvedev , has pledged to tackle the problem - although correspondents say few expect things will change quickly .
Russia 's investigations committee has opened more than 1,000 corruption cases involving officials in 10 months .
The committee 's chairman said the extent of corruption was much wider .
Alexander Bastrykin said the results of the investigations " do not yet equal the scope of bribery and corruption in bureaucracy " , state news agency Itar - Tass reports .
" Practice shows that modern corrupt officials , as a rule , are well - trained and backed up by resources of biased media outlets and legal advice of highly - paid professional lawyers , " he added .
Modern disease
The BBC's James Rodgers , in Moscow , says corruption is like a disease which affects almost every part of Russian life .
Russians were resigned to bribe - taking officials and business kickbacks worth billions , he said .
The committee heard that investigations included criminal cases against 13 judges , a former regional minister and district prosecutors , Itar - Tass reports .
One of the committee 's senior prosecutors , Vasily Piskaryov , said the income of corrupt officials reached more than a third of the national budget .
He said data provided by the non governmental Indem Foundation , suggested " business people spend $ 33.5 bn on bribes for officials , while low - level corruption is estimated to be worth $ 3bn " .

SOME folks in Texas recently decided to start a new community “ containing 100 % Ron Paul supporters ” .
Mr Paul is a staunch libertarian and , until recently , a Republican presidential candidate .
His most ardent fans are invited to build homesteads in “ Paulville ” , an empty patch of west Texas .
Here , they will be free .
Free not to pay “ for other people 's lifestyles [ they ] may not agree with ” .
And free from the irksome society of those who do not share their love of liberty .
Cynics chuckle , and even Mr Paul sounds unenthusiastic about the Paulville project , in which he had no hand .
But his followers ' desire to segregate themselves is not unusual .
Americans are increasingly forming like - minded clusters .
Conservatives are choosing to live near other conservatives , and liberals near liberals .
A good way to measure this is to look at the country 's changing electoral geography .
In 1976 Jimmy Carter won the presidency with 50.1 % of the popular vote .
Though the race was close , some 26.8 % of Americans were in “ landslide counties ” that year , where Mr Carter either won or lost by 20 percentage points or more .
The proportion of Americans who live in such landslide counties has nearly doubled since then .
In the dead - heat election of 2000 , it was 45.3 % .
When George Bush narrowly won re-election in 2004 , it was a whopping 48.3 % .
As the playwright Arthur Miller put it that year : “ How can the polls be neck and neck when I do n't know one Bush supporter ? ”
Clustering is how .
County - level data understate the degree of ideological segregation , reckons Bill Bishop , the author of a gripping new book called “ The Big Sort : Why the Clustering of Like - Minded America is Tearing Us Apart ” .
Counties can be big .
Cook County , Illinois , ( which includes Chicago ) , has over 5 m inhabitants .
Beaverhead County , Montana , covers 5,600 square miles ( 14,400 square kilometres ) .
The neighbourhoods people care about are much smaller .
Americans move house often , usually for practical reasons .
Before choosing a new neighbourhood , they drive around it .
They notice whether it has gun shops , evangelical churches and “ W ” bumper stickers , or yoga classes and organic fruit shops .
Perhaps unconsciously , they are drawn to places where they expect to fit in .
Where you live is partly determined by where you can afford to live , of course .
But the “ Big Sort ” does not seem to be driven by economic factors .
Income is a poor predictor of party preference in America ; cultural factors matter more .
For Americans who move to a new city , the choice is often not between a posh neighbourhood and a run-down one , but between several different neighbourhoods that are economically similar but culturally distinct .
For example , someone who works in Washington , DC , but wants to live in a suburb can commute either from Maryland or northern Virginia .
Both states have equally leafy streets and good schools .
But Virginia has plenty of conservative neighbourhoods with megachurches and Bushites you 've heard of living on your block .
In the posh suburbs of Maryland , by contrast , Republicans are as rare as unkempt lawns and yard signs proclaim that war is not the answer but Barack Obama might be .
At a bookshop in Bethesda ( one of those posh Maryland suburbs ) , Steven Balis , a retired lawyer with wild grey hair and a scruffy T - shirt , looks up from his New York Times .
He says he is a Democrat because of “ the absence of alternatives ” .
He comes from a family of secular Jews who supported the New Deal .
He holds “ positive notions of what government actions can accomplish ” .
Asked why he moved to Maryland rather than Virginia , he jokes that the far side of the river is “ Confederate territory ” .
Asked if he has hard - core social - conservative acquaintances , he answers simply : “ No . ”
Groupthink
Because Americans are so mobile , even a mild preference for living with like - minded neighbours leads over time to severe segregation .
An accountant in Texas , for example , can live anywhere she wants , so the liberal ones move to the funky bits of Austin while the more conservative ones prefer the exurbs of Dallas .
Conservative Californians can find refuge in Orange County or the Central Valley .
Over time , this means Americans are ever less exposed to contrary views .
In a book called “ Hearing the Other Side ” , Diana Mutz of the University of Pennsylvania crunched survey data from 12 countries and found that Americans were the least likely of all to talk about politics with those who disagreed with them .
Intriguingly , the more educated Americans become , the more insular they are .
( Hence Mr Miller 's confusion . )
Better - educated people tend to be richer , so they have more choice about where they live .
And they are more mobile .
One study that covered most of the 1980s and 1990s found that 45 % of young Americans with a college degree moved state within five years of graduating , whereas only 19 % of those with only a high - school education did .
There is a danger in this .
Studies suggest that when a group is ideologically homogeneous , its members tend to grow more extreme .
Even clever , fair - minded people are not immune .
Cass Sunstein and David Schkade , two academics , found that Republican - appointed judges vote more conservatively when sitting on a panel with other Republicans than when sitting with Democrats .
Democratic judges become more liberal when on the bench with fellow Democrats .
Residential segregation is not the only force Balkanising American politics , frets Mr Bishop .
Multiple cable channels allow viewers to watch only news that reinforces their prejudices .
The internet offers an even finer filter .
Websites such as conservativedates.com or democraticsingles.net help Americans find ideologically predictable mates .
And the home - schooling movement , which has grown rapidly in recent decades , shields more than 1 m American children from almost any ideas their parents dislike .
Melynda Wortendyke , a devout Christian who teaches all six of her children at her home in Virginia , says she took her eldest out of public kindergarten because she thought the standards there were low , but also because the kids were exposed to a book about lesbian mothers .
“ We now live in a giant feedback loop , ” says Mr Bishop , “ hearing our own thoughts about what 's right and wrong bounced back to us by the television shows we watch , the newspapers and books we read , the blogs we visit online , the sermons we hear and the neighbourhoods we live in . ”
Shouting at each other
One might ask : so what ?
If people are happier living with like - minded neighbours , why should n't they ?
No one is obviously harmed .
Mr Bishop does not , of course , suggest curbing Americans ' right to freedom of association .
But he worries about some of its consequences .
Voters in landslide districts tend to elect more extreme members of Congress .
Moderates who might otherwise run for office decide not to .
Debates turn into shouting matches .
Bitterly partisan lawmakers cannot reach the necessary consensus to fix long - term problems such as the tottering pensions and health - care systems .
America , says Mr Bishop , is splitting into “ balkanised communities whose inhabitants find other Americans to be culturally incomprehensible . ”
He has a point .
Republicans who never meet Democrats tend to assume that Democrats believe more extreme things than they really do , and vice versa .
This contributes to the nasty tone of many political campaigns .
Mr Bishop goes too far , however , when he says the “ big sort ” is “ tearing [ America ] apart ” .
American politics may be polarised , but at least no one is coming to blows over it .
“ We respect each other 's views , ” says Mrs Wortendyke of the few liberals in the home - schooling movement .
“ We hate each other cordially , ” says the liberal Mr Balis .

Dominance of Capitalism
A market economy is a tool — a valuable and effective tool — for organizing productive activity .
A market society is a way of life in which market values seep into every aspect of human endeavour .
It ’s a place where social relations are made over in the image of the market .
~ Michael J. Sandel ( age : 65 ) What Money Ca n’t Buy : The Moral Limits of Markets
Iraq War Pictures
Americans have a superstition , backed by law , that the bodies of Americans killed in war or their coffins must not be photographed .
Oddly , the superstition does not apply to those they have killed .
I see this law as a way to deceive the American people about the human costs of illegal wars .
As a Canadian , the law does not apply to me .
I feel a duty to punch Americans in the gut with such photos to persuade them to stop treating war as a football game .
~ Roedy ( age : 70 )
$ 13.5 trillion
Most Americans are in deep denial that their country would butcher children and civilians , routinely torture , or bomb homes .
Yet nearly every American saw this live on CNN ( Cable News Network ) with his own eyes on when America did its Shock & Awe bombing of the residential sections of Baghdad on the opening day of the war .
Granted , they did not see the blood spurting , but they saw apartments full of families being turned to rubble .
Everyone knows perfectly well what happens when a bomb hits an apartment .
Americans pretend the $ 2 trillion they borrowed for the war went for reconstruction .
If that were so , every Iraqi would be living in a $ 400,000.00 USD mansion .
That money clearly went for mayhem and destruction .
Soldiers are trained and paid to kill , not build schools or hand out candy .
America has behaved worse than Nazi Germany .
Americans plug their ears and say lah lah lah as if that would erase their responsibility .
How dare they claim to be a Christian nation !
Many Americans have written me convinced none of the casualties in the photos below could not possibly have been done by Americans .
They seem to think American soldiers are in Iraq to act as police rather than killers .
Consider .
Iraqis have only IEDs ( Improvised Explosive Devices ) IED ( Improvised Explosive Device ) s ) to fight with .
Whereas only American have helicopters to drop people out of , white phosphorus to mummify them , napalm to cook them to a crisp , cluster bombs to shread them , DU ( Depleted Uranium ) etc .
So if you see a white phosphorus victim , nobody but Americans could have done it .
Iraq war pictures Casualties of the Iraq War , American and Iraqi Modern medicine means that the ratio of American soldiers maimed / disabled / brain - damaged to killed is much higher than in previous wars .

Four Iraqi civilians were killed and two others were injured when U.S. soldiers opened fire .
Bush had the woman fired who dared to take this photo of coffins being loaded each night in Kuwait for secret shipment back home .
More .
Bush does not count soldiers who die en route to hospital or in hospital in Germany as deaths .
This means the true death count of American soldiers is over five times higher than Bush is reporting .
In the Pentagon relented and has released some coffin photos such as these .
It is illegal to take photographs of coffins of US soldiers , though in the military released some anonymous and undated photos .
Bush wants to pretend nobody dies in his wars and to hide the true number of deaths .
Not all the deaths are from bullets , napalm and white phosphorus .
Some a come from deliberate starvation , denial of water and denial of sanitation .
Check point
Burned corpse of American mercenary , a contractor for Blackwater security
There are suprisingly few pictures of the damage or the casualties of Gulf War I or the sanction bombings .
Bush Sr. exercised strict censorship .
Please pass on URLs ( Uniform Resource Locators ) of any photos that speak to the heart .
My opponents argue that I can’t prove precisely who was responsible for the carnage in any individual photo .
My intent is not a criminal investigation of each incident but to show you just how horrible war in general is .
It is no secret the USA has spent $ 300 billion on waging its war in Iraq , that it attacked unprovoked under false pretences and that it used weapons banned by the U.N. , including napalm , cluster bombs , depleted uranium and white phosphorus .
It also uses torture , rape and attack dogs on children .
The pictures on and linked to by my website do n’t come even close to depicting the true hell president Bush has created in his bid to takeover Iraq ’s oil .
You might wonder why there are not more pictures of American casualties .
There are four reason for this :
The US military heavily censors photos of US casualties .
There are far fewer US casualties than Iraqi .
US soldiers like to photograph dead Iraqis much as they photograph hunting trophies .
Iraqis are not as well supplied with cameras .
I do n’t really give a fig personally about US soldiers who die .
Those US soldiers voluntarily chose the profession of hired killers .
They kill for thrills and money , not because they are defending their country .
I care about civilians , especially children , of any nationality or religion .
I realise , however , that most Americans are infected with racism and nationalism and care only about American deaths and then only white ones , so I will gladly post any photos you can find of US casualties to pound home the cost of this war in suffering to Americans too .
Denial

Freedom = No Health Care Freedom is always just one generation away from extinction .
We do n’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream .
We have to fight for it and protect it and then hand it to them , so that they shall do the same , or we ’re going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our children ’s children , about a time in America , back in the day , when men and women were free .

I think we can all agree that Chris Wallace shit the bed tonight .

Aaron Ramsey is regarded as the outstanding talent of his generation and last night Sir Alex Ferguson was left counting the cost of not personally meeting the 17 - year - old after he opted to join Arsenal instead .
The Manchester United manager has lost the first major transfer battle of the summer to Arsène Wenger , whose meeting with Ramsey swung the £ 5 m deal in Arsenal 's favour .
Ferguson was the only one of the three managers in serious pursuit of Ramsey – the other being Everton 's David Moyes – who did not break off from his summer holidays to meet the Cardiff City player , instead delegating the meeting to a member of his staff .
Ferguson is usually such a brilliant recruiter of young players – his trips to meet parents have so often proved the clincher in deals – but it was Wenger who gave Arsenal 's interest the personal touch by inviting Ramsey out on a private jet to Switzerland , where he is working as a television pundit at Euro 2008 .
Despite late attempts by United to swing the deal in their favour , the player completed his contract negotiations and medical with Arsenal yesterday .
United had also assumed the player would be happy with an arrangement in which he would be loaned back to Cardiff for part of the next season .
Wenger , as he did with Theo Walcott when he joined from Southampton two years ago , promised the player on Saturday that he would be developed at Arsenal .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
While Wenger met Ramsey and his family in Basle , neither Ferguson nor his assistant Carlos Queiroz , who are both out of the country , were at Old Trafford when the Welsh teenager visited the stadium last week .
It was the readiness of Arsenal to make such an effort for the young player that made the difference , as both clubs offered personal terms that were very similar .
Moyes is understood to have made an impression on Ramsey but , against Wenger 's reputation for developing young players , the Everton manager was always likely to finish second best .
United also prematurely announced on their website last week that they had agreed the transfer fee with Cardiff and would sign Ramsey , subject to a medical and personal terms .
The implied message was that the deal was as good as done , but Ramsey had not even met with Wenger by then .
United believed they were the favourites because the Cardiff chairman , Peter Ridsdale , was behind Ferguson 's plan to loan Ramsey back to the club next season .
Ramsey made his professional debut for Cardiff at the age of 16 .
He has been capped seven times for the Wales Under - 21 team , so it is not inconceivable that he will get an early chance to make his Arsenal first - team debut .
Wenger 's record with young British players has been patchy – Walcott is an undoubted talent , although at 19 is still developing ; but Francis Jeffers and Richard Wright both fell well short of the required standard .
Nevertheless , Wenger 's academy has some of the most promising young English players in the country , including the midfielder Jack Wilshere who , at 16 , is rated as the best young English prospect the club have had in years .
Ferguson 's main transfer targets this summer did not include a midfielder , which perhaps accounts for United being slow off the mark in chasing Ramsey .
With the priority a striker – Spurs ' Dimitar Berbatov and Roque Santa Cruz , of Blackburn , top the list – and a right - back – possibly Bayern Munich 's Philipp Lahm – he is blessed with a number of central midfielders .
However , as when Ferguson signed Wayne Rooney in 2004 , it is not often that a talent such as Ramsey is available on the market .
The teenager is the second of Cardiff 's recent group of bright young players to leave for the Premier League .
The right - back Chris Gunther signed for Tottenham for £ 2 m in January , and Ridsdale said that he wanted Ramsey back on loan .
" The only deal with a loan - back option was with Manchester United , " Ridsdale said , " but ultimately it is up to the player to decide where he wants to go . "
Arsenal have yet to tie up a deal with Marseilles ' Samir Nasri .
The attacking midfielder had been granted permission to leave the France camp at Euro 2008 to travel to England , but did not make the trip .
The 20 - year - old is rated at around £ 11 m .
While Wenger works for French television in Switzerland , the club 's acting managing director , Ken Friar , is taking care of negotiations for new players .
The best league in the world is back .

The report , Australia 's Future ' Fat Bomb ' , from Melbourne 's Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute , will be presented at the Federal Government 's inquiry into obesity , which comes to Melbourne today .
A grim picture is painted of expanding waistlines fuelled by a boom in fast food and a decline in physical activity , turning us into a nation of sedentary couch potatoes .
Those most at risk of premature death are the middle - aged , with 70 % of men and 60 % of women aged 45 to 64 now classed as obese .
But some weight specialists have questioned the tool used to measure obesity , saying " entire rugby teams " would be classified as obese if their body mass index ( BMI ) was calculated .
BMI is measured by dividing weight in kilograms by height in metres squared .
A BMI of over 25 is considered overweight while more than 30 is obese .
But the tool does not distinguish between muscle and fat , prompting calls for the BMI overweight limit to be raised to 28 .
However , even leading nutritionist Jenny O'Dea from the University of Sydney  who recently claimed Australia 's childhood obesity epidemic had been exaggerated  has backed the new figures , which suggest that the crisis for adults has been drastically underestimated .
Professor O'Dea said that while being fat was not necessarily a health risk for everyone , there was no doubt obesity was taking its toll on the nation .
It was previously thought that around 3 million adults were obese .
But many past surveys were seen as unreliable as they often required participants to guess their own weight .
The latest data was based on more than 14,000 people at 100 rural and metropolitan sites in every Australian state and territory .
Each had their BMI recorded by having their weight , height and waist measured as part of a national blood pressure screening day last year .
The report 's lead author , Simon Stewart , said that even allowing for the BMI 's potential failings , the best case scenario was that 3.6 million adults were battling obesity .
" We could fill the MCG 40 times over with the number of obese Australians now , then you can double that if you look at the people who are also overweight  those are amazing figures , " Professor Stewart said .
" And in terms of a public health crisis , there is nothing to rival this .
If we ran a fat Olympics we'd be gold medal winners as the fattest people on earth at the moment , " he said .
" We 've heard of AIDS orphans in Africa , we 're looking at this time bomb going off where parents have to think about this carefully , " Professor Steward said .
" They 're having children at an older age , if you 're obese and you have a child do you really want to miss out on their wedding ?
" Do you want to miss out on the key events in their life ?
Yes you will if you do n't do something about your weight now . "
The obesity inquiry in Melbourne will be told that a national strategy encouraging overweight Australians to lose five kilograms in five months could reduce heart - related hospital admissions by 27 % and cut deaths by 34 % over the next 20 years .
Among the radical solutions proposed in the report is a plan to make fat towns compete for " healthy " status in national weight loss contests tied to Federal Government funding .
Towns that lost the most weight would be given cash to build sports centres and swimming pools .
And like the " Tidy Towns " program , communities would have to meet targets to be eligible for a share of the funding pool .
Other suggestions from Professor Stewart 's report include subsidised gym memberships , personal training sessions for heavier people and restricting weight loss surgery to those who show they can lose some weight on their own first .
One of Australia 's leading obesity experts , Boyd Swinburn , will tell the inquiry in his own submission that a crackdown on junk food marketing to children is paramount in the fight against the epidemic .
With the fastest growing rate of childhood obesity in the world , Australia must make radical changes to the way unhealthy food is promoted if the rate is to be reduced , his submission reads .
Professor Swinburn , director of the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Obesity Prevention at Deakin University , will argue that better nutritional labelling and more funding for effective treatments such as weight - loss surgery are also necessary .
" We 've got a huge problem here and we can't bury our head in the sand any more , " Professor Swinburn will tell the inquiry .
" The previous federal government blamed parents and individuals and told them to pull up their socks that 's not going to achieve anything but make us fatter as a nation .
" It 's good to see the Rudd Government take obesity seriously with this parliamentary inquiry and the preventative health strategy but that has to be turned into proper policy , regulation and funding . "
Ian Caterson , director of the Institute of Obesity , Nutrition and Exercise at the University of Sydney , said innovative government " thinking outside the square " policies were necessary because , " as we get fatter and older as a nation things are just going to get worse . "
EXPANDING WAISTLINES
About 4 million adult Australians are obese .
The " fat bomb " is ticking loudly , with 72 % of middle - aged males and 58 % of middle - aged females overweight or obese .
About 1.5 million middle - aged Australians are obese and therefore at high risk of a heart attack or stroke in the longer term .
Based on the best available evidence , our expanded middle - aged waistlines will result in an extra 700,000 cardiovascular - related hospital admissions in the next 20 years .
These highly preventable admissions will cost Australia , conservatively , an extra $ 3 billion in health expenditure and $ 6 billion overall .
Loading
An estimated 122,500 men and women will die , many prematurely , from heart problems related to their excess weight in the next 20 years .
A simple strategy such as losing 5 kg in five months could reduce heart - related hospital admissions by 27 % and deaths by 34 % over the next 20 years .

I love the way derivatives of types tell you about holes in containers .
It works the other way too and holes can give insight into derivatives .
Suppose S and T are containers so that S ( X ) and T ( X ) are containers of elements of type X . Then S ( T ( X ) ) is an S - container of T - containers of X's .
If we draw S as a square ( rectangle actually ) and T as a triangle then we can draw a picture of an example of such a thing :
Taking the nth derivative of a type gives the type with ( an ordered sequence of ) n holes .
Here 's that previous container with 3 holes made in it :
As the holes have an ordering I 've numbered them from 1 to 3 .
An S - container of T - containers with holes is essentially an S - container containing both ordinary T - containers , and some T - containers with holes .
If we excise the T - containers with holes , we 're left with an S - container containing just T - containers , and some holes .
Here 's a picture of that :
But there are a couple of problems with that .
Once we 've excised the holey sub T - containers we do n't know which S - holes to plug them back into and we do n't know how to reconstruct the original numbering of the holes .
We need to keep a tiny bit more information .
That 's the set I wrote down : { {1,3} , {2}} .
Call each element of this set a block .
I 've written the elements of the blocks in ascending order and I 've written the blocks in ascending order of their lowest elements .
The first block corresponds to hole 1 in the S - container and the second block corresponds to hole 2 .
Similarly , we write the elements of the blocks into the holes in the T - containers .
And that allows us to reconstruct the original ST - container .
Think about the general case .
We make n holes in an ST - container .
So up to n of the T - containers acquire holes .
Let 's say it 's m holes .
We can think of the S - container having m holes and these holes being filled by T - containers with b , b , ... , bholes where the sum of the bis n .
We 're essentially just partitioning the original n holes { 1,2 , ..., n} into m sets .
So each ST - container with n holes gives a partition of { 1 , ...,n} , an S - container with n holes , and m T - containers where the ith has bholes .
Writing containers with n holes as nth derivatives we getNote that the equality above is n't just a numerical equality , it 's an isomorphism of types .
In fact , it 's the type version of the ' combinatorial form ' of the Faà di Bruno formula .
Although that wikipedia page describes the formula as ' forbidding ' , if I 've done my job right then I think the above picture make it seem almost trivial .
I find it much easier to think of this version of the chain rule in terms of holes .
And the explanation for the title of this post : in 1988 Pope John Paul II beatified Faà di Bruno .

This morning , EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien testified in a Senate hearing on laptop searches and other privacy violations faced by Americans at the U.S. border .
Lee 's testimony [ PDF ] outlined the dangers of random and invasive searches of travelers ' digital devices , and urged more congressional investigation and oversight .
Today 's hearing comes as Americans are increasingly complaining about how the Department of Homeland Security searches laptops , cell phones , and other digital devices as they come home from overseas travel .
Agents often confiscate the devices , copy the contents , and sometimes even provide a copy of the data to the Department of Justice -- even when the traveler is not suspected of criminal activity .
EFF is deeply concerned about this blanket search and seizure power .
We 've participated as amicus in US v. Arnold , an important case concerning suspicionless searches at the border .
We 've also teamed up with other privacy and professional associations to ask lawmakers for answers , and we 've sued DHS for refusing to make their policies public .
If you are concerned about your privacy at the border , you can read up on our tips to protect yourself .
But without better polices at the border , there are no guarantees .
The unique nature of electronic information stored on computers and other portable devices requires search standards that protect the privacy of Americans in the Information Age , and we hope that Congress soon starts work on this important issue .

One of the first things U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen ( D–Wisc. ) did when he took office last year was to nix his congressional health care coverage .
The move stunned a human resources staffer , who , the lawmaker says , looked at him as though he were insane .
" I 'll respectfully decline until you can make that same offer for all of my constituents , " he says he told her , explaining his decision to turn down what many say is the Cadillac of U.S. health plans .
Kagen , 58 , is now one of millions of Americans , including at least nine million children , without health insurance .
" I have absolutely no health coverage at all , " he told ScientificAmerican.com during a recent interview .
" I have no health conditions and am pretty darn healthy . "
And if he gets sick ?
" I 'd be just like the 47 [ million ] to 50 million American citizens who do n't have coverage , " he says , " and I 'd have to negotiate with hospitals and doctors for the best - priced coverage . "
Until he took office , Kagen , a successful allergist with offices in Appleton and Green Bay , was on the other side of such negotiations .
He is now one of nine physicians who traded in their stethoscopes for a House seat — and the only member of Congress to refuse coverage .
Kagen 's seemingly brazen act was part of his health care reform strategy .
In February he introduced the " No Discrimination in Health Insurance Act of 2008 " ( H.R. 5449 ) , which would bar insurance companies from hiking rates or denying coverage for preexisting medical conditions .
" Nowhere in the Constitution does it say you have a protected right to health care , " he says .
" But the reverse is more important .
You can't be discriminated against because of the color of your skin or your sex , nor because of diseases such as hypertension or diabetes . "
His goal : to make health insurance affordable for everyone — and make sure that nobody is left out in the cold .
He feels it is crucial to have a federal standard on the books to replace the patchwork of state insurance regulations .
" Simply put , if you 're a citizen , you 're in , " he says .
" We have federal standards in America for everything ... except the one thing we value most , and that is our health . "
In an effort to keep a lid on soaring insurance premiums , Kagen 's proposal calls for insurance companies to disclose all of their rates .
Such a move , he says , would prevent patients from being hit with hidden costs and stir competition that would , theoretically , drive down prices .
He says his own analysis shows that the combination of competition and blanket eligibility could cut people 's insurance expenses by as much as 20 percent .
But that 's still too high a tab for many financially strapped U.S. families .
The question is :
How are those people going to foot the bill ?
Not sure , says Kagen , whose legislation does not propose setting aside any federal funds .
The key reason , he says , is that there are no reliable stats on such costs .
Ron Pollack , executive director of Families USA , a nonprofit organization in Washington , D.C. , pushing for affordable health care for all Americans , calls the measure " a step in the right direction , " but notes that ultimately the feds need " to extend public programs or provide subsidies , such as refundable tax credits or some other means " to have truly universal health coverage .
But that does n't mean that the insured will have to swallow the costs , Kagen says .
In fact , he insists that his legislation would actually drive down premiums for everyone , noting that a major reason they are so pricey is that hospitals and doctors charge the insured artificially inflated rates to cover the unpaid bills of the uninsured .
There is " a hidden health care tax within every product and every service in America , because of today 's discriminatory health care system , " he says .
Many , from Kagen to insurance groups , say that will change when everyone has access to coverage .
America 's Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) , a Washington , D.C. - based insurance trade group , has proposed another way to make sure that individuals with preexisting conditions are eligible for reasonable rates .
Under its plan , insurers would voluntarily commit to offer those who did not qualify for standard insurance policies the option of buying one at a rate no more than one and a half times the price of traditional packages .
The federal government would still have to fork over funds for those unable to come up with the cost of a premium .
But AHIP 's Mohit Ghose says universal health coverage would save money in the long run .
He says AHIP estimates that it currently costs the government and the insured roughly $ 50 billion annually to make up for the deficits the uninsured .
In contrast , he says , it would cost around $ 30 billion a year — a whopping $ 20 billion savings — to cover all Americans under its package .
Ghose says that AHIP does not support Kagen 's bill , because it has its own proposal it would like to see enacted .
But , he says , the group backs the emergence of ideas " so we can dissect them and work together to get more Americans covered . "
Kagen 's measure has 17 co-sponsors ( all Democrats ) and , in addition to Families USA , enjoys the backing of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees .
He acknowledges that it does n't have a shot at becoming law under the Bush administration , but says he 'll boost efforts for passage once the new president takes office in January .
Kagen says he hopes that either Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton — whoever nabs the Democratic nod — will be that person , noting that they both have " excellent " health care proposals .
In the meantime , he says , " I hope to be the doctor in the House who helps determine what it is that people need " — at least on the health care front .
The mere mention of moving biodiesel through pipelines brings so many related aspects into question that Biodiesel Magazine decided it was time to address the totality of these interrelated concerns .
By Ron Kotrba | May 14 , 2008
ADVERTISEMENT
To some skeptics , the preclusion of biodiesel in the pipeline network was by and large predetermined before the industry manufactured enough gallons to even worry about it .
With merit some assert it 's the aviation customers higher on the food chain who really run the show , because of the care and cost that are put into jet propellant .
The assertion is that those customers hinder biodiesel 's acceptance in the pipeline , telling suppliers that they will not buy their fuel if methyl ester contamination is possible to any degree .
Then there are those who say that the problem lies with jet engine manufacturers , who have n't researched this enough to set a maximum trace allowance for jet fuel as it relates to airplane engine performance and safety .
On that note , the absence of a single - digit parts per million ( ppm ) test method and instrumentation makes the lack of a max trace threshold moot .
Unfortunately concerns about biodiesel properties and the quality of the larger intermingled pipelined diesel fuel pool continue to hold back its wider acceptance in the pipelines .
A Spanish company however , is pipelining a bioblend without incident via the same infrastructure through which jet fuel is transported .
Because of the international nature of jet fuel specifications - planes flying from the United States to Spain must refuel - the entire argument against pipelining biodiesel needs to be revisited .
The replacement of No. 2 low sulfur diesel ( LSD ) fuel , which contains 500 ppm of sulfur , with 15 - ppm ultra - low sulfur diesel ( ULSD ) , as part of U.S. EPA 's diesel emissions reduction plan , opened up a can of worms that some say still affects the biodiesel industry today .
For years , sulfur acted as a lubricity agent in diesel fuel until it was significantly reduced to comply with new advanced emissions control devices debuting commercially in the 2007 model year .
Lubricity additives of a different nature would come into play , and with them new concerns about how those additives , if blended at the refinery , would affect other products moving in the same pipeline .
In October 2004 , Colonial Pipeline Co. , the largest pipeline network in the Eastern United States , decided not to allow lubricity additives in its network .
When Colonial Pipeline decided to exclude ULSD treated with lubricity additives from its network , most other pipeline operators followed suit according to the American Petroleum Institute 's Al Mannato , who presented in November 2004 at a ULSD workshop .
The reason : residual amounts of lubricants were detected in products such as jet fuel in which these additives are prohibited .
Prior to Colonial Pipeline 's October decision it announced procedures for the approval of additized ULSD , two of which stated the additive must not impact the quality of other products ; and there be an upper limit placed on additive concentration .
Subsequent testing by the pipeline operator yielded microseparometer values indicating degradation of jet fuel .
Jet fuel thermal oxidation tester results conducted by Colonial Pipeline also indicated a kerosene movement was degraded and trailback of the lubricity additive was detected in the kerosene .
These poor results led Colonial Pipeline to exclude lubricity additives in its line .
According to an article published in the trade journal Pipeline & Gas Journal in November 2004 , the pipeline spent five months testing and moved three trial shipments with additized ULSD before reaching its decision ; however , the journal notes , results from these tests do n't mesh with Colonial Pipeline 's earlier laboratory tests or with experience from pipeline operators outside the United States .
So what does any of this have to do withbiodiesel ?
A biodiesel trader working in the fuels distribution field who requested anonymity tells Biodiesel Magazine that after Colonial Pipeline made its decision to exclude additized ULSD in its line , truck racks across the nation were required to make large $ 1 million plus investments per site in order to blend lubricity additives at the terminals rather than at the refineries .
" That lubricity additive is basically a methyl ester , " the source says .
" After doing all of that , they could hardly turn around a month or two later and say , ' Oh yeah , we excluded the lubricity additive but you can move a B5 blend . '
So the timing for biodiesel pipeline acceptance and the ULSD rollout was very much a problem .
It 's been something for the pipeline guys to hide behind in order to put this thing off .
" Many media reports regarding airlines and jet engine makers testing or using biofuels have come across the wire in the past several months but none of these include methyl ester biodiesel .
If jet fuel traders express such concerns over ultra-low concentrations of fatty acid methyl ester ( FAME ) trailback in aviation fuel , then using a biodiesel blend in jet engines is certainly out of the question .
Representatives from Buckeye Partners and Northville Products Services , who presented at the 2008 National Biodiesel Conference & Expo , indicated that jet engine makers need to determine a maximum trace FAME allowance in jet fuel in order to give would - be biodiesel movers a threshold within which trailback could be contained .
Conversely , a low - level FAME detector , which reads down to single digit ppm , has yet to be developed .
In February 2007 , NPS released its report on B5 test movements through Colonial Pipeline in which the bioblend was followed by LSD .
In its report , the company states , " The sampling of the trailing low sulfur diesel batch identified some level of trailback .
The exact quantification of the trail - back is impossible to determine due to the current inaccuracy of the test methods at very low levels of methyl esters .
� [ Colonial Pipeline ] has determined that methyl ester trailback will require segregation of jet fuel shipments to prevent any amounts of contamination �
The adverse affects of this ' batch approach ' is that it adds costs to the system at multiple points and minimizes shipper and pipeline operating flexibility .
" NPS notes in the report 's conclusion that test methods to determine trailback below 1.7 percent by volume do not readily exist commercially , adding , " NPS and [ Colonial Pipeline ] would like to see a test method developed with accuracy to single digit parts per million of methyl ester . "
According to information presented one year later at the 2008 National Biodiesel Conference and analytical companies ' reluctance to comment on the issue , this is still the case ostensibly .
Matt Bowman , global technical sales development manager for PerkinElmer LAS , says , " There is at least one technique PerkinElmer has that can detect bio-material . "
Bowman says the technique is not specific to biodiesel ( FAME ) or ethanol , but it could be used to determine cross contamination in pipeline products .
" As with most problems , necessity is the mother of invention , " he says , implying there is little need as of yet for trace FAME test methods and instrumentation .
Biodiesel Magazine attempted to get comments from jet engine makers on the lack of a fuel specification established to cap trace methyl ester content in aviation fuel , but they were reluctant to comment .
Only one engine maker chose to respond to requests for information .
Boeing said it would prepare a statement for this article on the matter .
Instead , Peter Conte of media relations with Boeing Commercial Airplanes sent an e-mail stating , " We are going to decline to comment on this matter at this time .
I would encourage you to contact us again in the not - too - distant future after we have made more progress with our biofuel research .
" Compania Logistica de Hidrocarburos , a Spanish fuel logistics company , has been moving B5 in its pipelines for one year , according to Pedro Martinez , CLH director of communications .
" At the moment , we protect aviation kerosene batches with other petroleum products without biodiesel in order to keep the content of methyl ester in jet fuel below 5 ppm , " Martinez tells Biodiesel Magazine .
The protocol for this he says can be found in Joint Inspection Group bulletin # 15 .
" This is not the best solution , so we hope new jet fuel specifications will allow a certain content of biodiesel - like 100 ppm - to get a sustainable solution .

Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama is campaigning in Albuquerque , New Mexico where he hosted a discussion with working women .
Much of Obama ’s remarks were devoted to going after John McCain for not supporting equal pay for women .
“ It starts with equal pay .
62 percent of working women in America earn half – or more than half – of their family ’s income .
But women still earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men .
In 2008 , you ’d think that Washington would be united in its determination to fight for equal pay .
That ’s why I was proud to co-sponsor the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration
Act , which would have reversed last year ’s Supreme Court decision , which made it more difficult for women to challenge pay discrimination on the job , ” Obama said .
He then said that McCain agreed with the Supreme Court decision , But Senator McCain thinks the Supreme Court got it right .
He opposed the Fair Pay Restoration Act .
He suggested that the reason women do n’t have equal pay is n’t discrimination on the job – it ’s because they need more education and training .
That ’s just totally wrong …
John McCain just has it wrong .
He said the Fair Pay Restoration Act “ opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems . ”
But I ca n’t think of any problem more important than making sure that women get equal pay for equal work .
It ’s a matter of equality .
It ’s a matter of fairness . ”

In the McCain campaign ’s dream scenario , women would be so upset that Hillary Clinton did not win the Democratic nomination that they would refuse to support Obama , and side with McCain .
The reality is that the opposite is happening .
Recent polls have shown that Clinton supporters are solidly moving towards Obama .
While there are some women who will vote for McCain out of disappointment , the vast majority of female Democrats see that on the issues they care about , Barack Obama is the better choice for them .
I do n’t understand how McCain thinks that liberally minded women would support him when he has an entire record that goes against women ’s rights .
Pro-choice women wo n’t support McCain once they find out that he is solidly anti-abortion .
He does n’t believe in equal pay , and he is also against expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act .
Obama knows that if he can get the solid support of women and minorities , this will be a powerful enough coalition to carry him to victory in November .

Mistakes can be predicted by patterns of brain activity Boring jobs switch our minds to autopilot , say scientists - and it means we can seriously mess up some simple tasks .
Monotonous duties switch our brain to " rest mode " , whether we like it or not , the researchers report in Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences .
They found mistakes can be predicted up to 30 seconds before we make them , by patterns in our brain activity .
The team hopes to design an early - warning brain monitor for pilots and others in " critical situations " .
The scientists say the device would be particularly suitable for monotonous jobs where focus is hard to maintain - such as passport and immigration control .
Mistakes ' foreshadowed '
" We might be able to build a device ( that could be placed ) on the heads of people that makes these easy decisions , " said Dr Eichele , of the University of Bergen , Norway .
" We can measure the signal and give feedback to the user that your brain is in the state where your decisions are not going to be the right one . "
Headsets could be designed to offer " early warning " of mistakes
In the study , Dr Eichele and his colleagues asked participants to repeatedly perform a " flanker task " - an experiment in which individuals must quickly respond to visual clues .
As they did so , brain scans were performed using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
They found the participants ' mistakes were " foreshadowed " by a particular pattern of brain activity .
" To our surprise , up to 30 seconds before the mistake we could detect a distinct shift in activity , " said Dr Stefan Debener , of Southampton University , UK .
" The brain begins to economise , by investing less effort to complete the same task .
" We see a reduction in activity in the prefrontal cortex .
At the same time , we see an increase in activity in an area which is more active in states of rest , known as the Default Mode Network ( DMN ) . "
Workplace safety
This is not a sign of the brain going to sleep , says Debener .
" Autopilot would be a better metaphor , " he explains .
" We can assume that the tendency to economise task performance leads to an inappropriate reduction of effort , thus causing errors . "
Device could help pilots and air traffic controllers maintain focus
Since this state begins about 30 seconds prior to a mistake being made , it could be possible to design an early - warning system that alerts people to be more focused or more careful , said the researchers .
That could significantly improve workplace safety and also improve performance in key tasks , such as driving , analysis of X - rays , or airport security screening .
But MRI scanners are neither portable enough nor fast enough to be practical for these real life scenarios , so the next step is to see if more mobile EEG devices are able to detect the phenomenon .
A prototype of a wireless , mobile , and lightweight EEG amplifier is currently in development and could be ready for the market in " 10 to 15 years " , says Dr Debener , who is based at the MRC Institute of Hearing Research , at Royal South Hants Hospital .
" But first , we must establish what is causing these mistakes , " he adds .
" We do not know whether the change in brain activity we see has a causal link to the mistakes .
After we establish that , we can try to develop monitoring devices . "

What are these ?
The three centuries from 1100 to 800 B.C. are known as the Dark Age - dark because we have too little evidence to obtain a clear picture of Greek life , and dark also because civilization took dramatic steps backward .
Literacy virtually vanished , and writing stopped .
Poverty and primitive conditions prevailed , causing suffering , a loss of skills , a shrinkage of the communities , a great forgetting of the past , and a halt in progress .
After about 1050 B.C. , however , iron began to replace bronze for weapons and utensils .
Moreover , we know that there were migrations of Greeks to the Aegean coasts of Asia Minor and especially to the central region later called Ionia by 800 B.C.
On the mainland , the Athenians escaped the full impact of the Dorian invasions ; perhaps their good fortune started them on the way to leadership of Greece .
The end of the Dark Age is closely tied to the oral composition of the Iliad ( sixteen thousand lines ) and the Odyssey ( twelve thousand lines ) .
It seems probable that both poems took roughly the form in which we know them at some time between 850 and 750 B.C.
The Odyssey was almost surely composed later than the Iliad , though it may be a later work of the same person who composed the Iliad in his youth .
This person , whom we call Homer , was really a singer , putting together in these monumental narratives shorter songs about the deeds of heroes .
Such singers , accompanying themselves on stringed instruments , sang the shorter separate songs to audiences seated at table in a princely household , or to a gathering of villagers in a public square , or to soldiers around a campfire .
The Iliad and the Odyssey represent only a fraction of the epic material that existed in the Dark Age ; there were many other tales of heroes that were less popular or that stood the test of performance less well .
The composer of the long poems was selecting favorites that , when assembled , would make a coherent narrative .
Works as long as the Iliad or Odyssey would have taken several days to recite .
They may have been put together specifically for some nobleman ’s prolonged feast or for a religious festival .
But it seems more probable that a great singer who knew many of the individual songs was inspired to assemble them .
For a long time after their composition , both poems continued to be transmitted orally .
In the sixth century B.C. , the Iliad and the Odyssey were recited in public every four years at an Athenian festival ; the law required that this be done in order and without omissions .
By then , presumably , the poems had been written down ; but it was not for another three centuries that a stable “ scholarly ” text was produced in Alexandria .
The Iliad deals with a single episode that took place during the siege of Troy - the wrath of the Greek hero Achilles , who stopped fighting and sulked in his tent because the commander , Agamemnon , had taken from him a captive Trojan girl .
Agamemnon had allowed himself to be persuaded to restore his own captive girl
to her family , and made up for his loss by taking Achilles ’ prize away .
While Achilles refused to fight , the great combat continued .
Eventually , when Hector , a Trojan prince , had killed Achilles ’ best friend and comradein - arms , Patroclus , Achilles returned to the battle and slew Hector .
At the very end he returned the body to Hector ’s sorrowing father , Priam .
The Odyssey tells of the ten - year wanderings of another Greek hero , Odysseus , after the siege of Troy was over , and of the extraordinary places and peoples he visited on the way back to his home on the island of Ithaca , where his faithful wife Penelope awaited him despite the attention of many suitors , and whence their son Telemachus had set out to find his father .
Put in this summary form , the two stories seem blunt and commonplace .
But a deep humanity pervades both .
Despite the continual bloody fighting in the Iliad , modern readers - like all before them - are moved by the terror of Hector ’s baby son , Astyanax , when he sees his father with his fierce plumed war helmet on ; feel the truth of the passage in which the old men of Troy admit that Helen was well worth all the fuss ; share the grief and dignity of Priam as he begs Achilles to return Hector ’s body for a decent burial ; and appreciate Achilles ’ courteous generosity to an enemy when he reluctantly agrees .
The romantic Odyssey , with its lotus eaters , sirens , men turned to swine by enchantment , and fierce one - eyed giant , provides similar moments of high human drama in the homecoming of Odysseus in disguise ; in the responses of his favorite dog and his old nurse ; and in the sorrow of the beautiful island princess Nausicaa when she finds that Odysseus will not stay and be her lover .
It is possible that there are real links stretching backward from the Iliad and the Odyssey across the Dark Age , when the singer ’s art was kept alive in Ionia , to heroic songs composed by Mycenaeans themselves .
The long Catalog of the Ships in the Iliad , for example , lists the contingents supplied to the Greek armies at Troy by the various Greek settlements , and names their commanders .
Many think it a real Bronze
Age document that provides evidence about the diverse political organization of Mycenaean society : by city , by the captain the troops followed , and by tribe .
The description of Odysseus ’s household as including more than fifty slaves is often taken to indicate that slavery was common in Mycenaean times .
And some draw conclusions from the poems about the inheritance of royal power or the existence of assemblies of elders .
Whether or not we use the poems as history today , the Greeks themselves certainly did so , forming their own conception of their ancestral past from the Iliad and the Odyssey .
Together with the Hebrew Bible , the Homeric poems form the greatest literary and cultural legacy of ancient people .
Indeed , many modern scholars maintain that both Homeric and Hebrew civilizations grew directly from a common eastern Mediterranean background and point to many parallels in action and attitude .

SICHUAN , China ( CNN ) --
Li Yunxia wipes away tears as rescue crews dig through the ruins of a kindergarten class that has buried her only child -- a 5 - year - old boy .
Other parents wail as soldiers in blue masks trudge through the mud , hauling bodies from the rubble on stretchers .
" Children were screaming , but I could n't hear my son's voice , " she says , sobbing .
This grim ritual repeated itself Thursday across southwestern China , as thousands of mothers and fathers await news about their sons and daughters .
Watch parents ' anguished vigil »
The death toll from Monday 's massive earthquake could be as high as 50,000 , according to state - run media .
Map »
The grief is compounded in many cases by a Chinese policy that limits most couples to one child , a measure meant to control explosive population growth .
As a result of the one - child policy , the quake -- already responsible for at least 15,000 deaths -- is producing another tragic aftershock :
Not only must thousands of parents suddenly cope with the loss of a child , but many must cope with the loss of their only child .
China 's population minister recently praised the one - child rule , which dates to 1979 , saying it has prevented 400 million children from being born .
Some wealthy families ignore the order , have more children and pay a $ 1,000 fine .
In rural areas -- like earthquake - devastated Sichuan province -- families can petition for an additional child , but there 's no guarantee the authorities will approve the request -- they usually do n't .
That reality has cast parents like Li into an agonizing limbo -- waiting to discover whether their only child is alive or dead .
Thousands of children were in class when the temblor hit Monday afternoon .
Many of their schools collapsed on top of them .
In Dujiangyan City , more than 300 students were feared dead when Juyuan Middle School collapsed with 900 students inside .
A similar number died at the city 's Xiang'e Middle School .

Now parents cluster outside collapsed school buildings , held back by soldiers in some cases as rescue crews search for signs of life .
" Which grade are you in ? " a rescuer asks a trapped child in Beichuan County .
" Grade 2 , " comes the answer .
" Hang on for a while , " he says .
" We are figuring out ways to rescue you . "
Watch children rescued from the rubble »
The child is pulled from the rubble a short time later .
For every child saved , though , many more are lost .
Many are missing at a middle school in the city of Qingchuan .
The scene is devastating at Juyuan Middle School , where sorrow seems endless .

" There were screaming parents , and as the bodies would come out they were trying to identify whether it was their child or not , " said Jamil Anderlini of London 's Financial Times .
" And once they -- the parents -- realized it was their child , obviously they collapsed in grief . "

BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Fierce clashes raged in Beirut on Thursday after the Iranian - backed group Hezbollah said the U.S. - supported Lebanese government had declared war by targeting its military communications network .
Pro-government loyalists burn tyres and set up barricades on the main road to the border with Syria in the Masna 'a area in eastern Lebanon May 8 , 2008 .

Security sources said the fighting killed at least 10 people and wounded 20 .
The thud of exploding grenades and crackle of automatic gunfire echoed throughout the night in the worst internal strife since the 1975 - 90 civil war .
Governing coalition leader Saad al - Hariri proposed a deal to end the crisis under which the government decisions that infuriated Hezbollah would be considered a “ misunderstanding . ”
The decisions would then be referred to the Lebanese army , which has been neutral in the confrontations , giving army commander General Michel Suleiman the option to suspend their implementation .
But Hezbollah ’s al - Manar TV later quoted an opposition source as rejecting any ideas for ending the conflict other than those proposed by Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah earlier on Thursday .
Nasrallah had demanded measures taken by the government this week be rescinded .
The U.N. Security Council called for “ calm and restraint , ” urging all sides to return to peaceful dialogue .
The White House urged Hezbollah to stop “ disruptive ” acts .
Fighters from the Shi’ite movements Hezbollah and Amal exchanged assault rifle fire and rocket - propelled grenades with pro-government gunmen , including fighters loyal to the Sunni Future movement , in several areas of the capital .
Security sources said Hezbollah gunmen overran at least five offices of Hariri ’s Future group and police - guarded houses of pro-government officials .
Many cars and shops were set on fire and scores of terrified civilians fled the hot spots .
Hezbollah launched a new campaign of street protests on Wednesday , piling pressure on the government after it declared Hezbollah ’s communications network illegal and removed the head of airport security , a figure close to the group , from his post .

Supporters of Hezbollah and its allies have blocked roads leading to the airport -- Lebanon ’s only air link to the outside world -- and other main streets , paralyzing much of the capital .
The airport was barely functioning with only a few flights arriving and taking off , airport officials said .
“ CUT THE HAND ”
Fighting escalated minutes after Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the only way out of the crisis was for the government to rescind the decisions and attend talks to end the political conflict with the Hezbollah - led opposition .
“ This decision is first of all a declaration of war and the launching of war by the government ... against the resistance and its weapons for the benefit of America and Israel , ” he said .
Nasrallah described the fixed - line network that connects the group ’s officials , military commanders and positions as a vital part of the military structure of the group , which fought a 34 - day war with Israel in 2006 .
“ I had said that we will cut the hand that targets the weapons of the resistance .
...
Today is the day to fulfill this decision , ” Nasrallah said via video link from an unknown location in Beirut ’s southern suburbs .
Hezbollah supporters and pro-government loyalists had clashed earlier in the day in the Bekaa Valley in the east of the country , where five were wounded , security sources said .
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said the Security Council should consider “ additional steps ” including sanctions if Syria and Hezbollah did not take steps to resolve the crisis .
“ Hezbollah needs to make a choice -- be a terrorist organization or be a political party , but quit trying to be both , ” said a White House spokesman .
“ They need to start playing a constructive role and stop their disruptive activities now . ”
“ It ’s double jeopardy : the cabinet ca n’t retreat or it is practically finished and ca n’t go through with it to the end because of the balance of power on the ground , ” columnist Rafik Khouri wrote in the newspaper al - Anwar .
“ And Hezbollah ca n’t step back from its position because it would be agreeing to getting its wings clipped and ca n’t go all the way because of the dangers sectarian strife poses for everyone . ”
Hezbollah has led a political campaign against Prime Minister Fouad Siniora ’s anti-Syrian cabinet .
The crisis has paralyzed much of the government , left Lebanon with no president for five months , and already led to bouts of violence .
The group was the only Lebanese faction allowed to keep its weapons after the civil war , to fight Israeli forces occupying the south .
Israel withdrew in 2000 and the fate of Hezbollah ’s weapons is at the heart of the political crisis .

Mr Webster moved to New Zealand after his first wife 's death A man at the centre of an investigation into his wife 's death 14 years ago is being hunted by police in New Zealand .
They are investigating a crash involving his second wife in similar circumstances to the one which killed his first wife in Aberdeenshire .
Claire Webster died in 1994 after the car driven by her husband Malcolm hit a tree near Oldmeldrum .
His second wife survived a crash in Auckland in 1998 but was found with a strong sedative in her system .
An investigation into Claire Webster 's death concluded that she had died accidentally .
However , Grampian Police is now re-examining the crash following a crash involving his second wife , Felicity Drumm .
Mr Webster moved to New Zealand where he lived with Ms Drumm .
He failed to appear at court and full warrants were issued .
They are still live
New Zealand Police spokesman
After the crash involving her , the 48 - year - old failed to appear in court on a number of charges and is the subject of four warrants , which include arson and disabling or stupefying his victim .
That led to questions over the exact circumstances surrounding his first wife 's death .
A New Zealand Police spokesman said : " We can confirm that Malcolm John Webster is the subject of four warrants for his failure to appear in the North Shore District Court of New Zealand on July 13 , 2000 .
" He failed to appear at court and full warrants were issued .
They are still live .
Two of them are for arson , the third is for selling , giving , supplying or administering a drug and the fourth is for disabling or stupefying his victim , his then wife .
" The arson charges relate to a fire at the home of his then wife 's parents . "
Spotted in Scotland Reports indicate Mr Webster is now back in the UK and has been spotted in Oban in Argyll and Bute , as well as Devon and Cornwall .
A Grampian Police spokesman said : " Grampian Police can confirm it is reviewing the circumstances surrounding a road traffic collision on May 28 , 1994 , on the Old Meldrum to Auchenhuive road in Aberdeenshire , where a woman tragically died .
" This remains at a very early stage and as is usual in such circumstances the Crown Office and procurator fiscal service are fully aware of the matter . "

What are these ?
Riots , protests and political unrest could multiply in the developing world as soaring inflation widens the gap between the " haves " and the " have nots " , an investment bank predicted yesterday .
Economists at Merrill Lynch view inflation as an " accident waiting to happen " .
As prices for food and commodities surge , the bank expects global inflation to rise from 3.5 % to 4.9 % this year .
In emerging markets , the average rate is to be 7.3 % .
The cost of food and fuel has already been cited as a factor leading to violence in Haiti , protests by Argentinian farmers and riots in sub-Saharan Africa , including attacks on immigrants in South African townships .
Merrill 's chief international economist , Alex Patelis , said this could be the tip of the iceberg , warning of more trouble " between nations and within nations " as people struggle to pay for everyday goods .
" Inflation has distributional effects .
If everyone 's income moved by the same rate , you would n't care - but it doesn't , " said Patelis .
" You have pensioners on fixed pensions .
Some people produce rice that triples in price , while others consume it . "
A report by Merrill urges governments to crack down on inflation , describing the phenomenon as the primary driver of macroeconomic trends .
The problem has emerged from poor food harvests , sluggish supplies of energy and soaring demand in rapidly industrialising countries such as China , where wage inflation has reached 18 % .
Unless policymakers take action to dampen prices and wages , Merrill says sudden shortages could become more frequent .
The bank cited power cuts in South Africa and a run on rice in Californian supermarkets as recent examples .
" You 're going to see tension between nations and within nations , " said Patelis .
The UN recently set up a taskforce to examine food shortages and price rises .
It has expressed alarm that its world food programme is struggling to pay for food for those most at need .
Last month , the World Bank 's president , Robert Zoellick , suggested that 33 countries could erupt in social unrest following a rise of as much as 80 % in food prices over three years .
Merrill 's report said the credit crunch has contributed to a global re-balancing , drawing to a close an era in which American consumers have been the primary drivers of the world 's economy .
In a gloomy set of forecasts , Merrill said it believes the US is in a recession - and that American house prices , which are among the root causes of the downturn , could fall by 15 % over the next 18 months .
The bank said Britain 's economic outlook is " deteriorating " as consumer confidence weakens .
The Office for National Statistics yesterday said that retail sales fell by 0.2 % in April compared to March .
Global inflationary pressures have led to higher prices in Britain highlighting the dilemma for the Bank of England 's monetary policy committee , which sets interest rates .
The MPC voted by eight to one to keep rates on hold last month in spite of a rapid slowdown in the British economy .
The Bank is concerned about food prices that rose by 6.6 % over the past year and soaring fuel costs , feeding higher inflation , which is now at 3 % .
Alistair Darling , the chancellor , met representatives of supermarkets and farmers yesterday to discuss the threat to the economy from the rising cost of food .
The US Federal Reserve , which has cut interest rates to 2 % , is gloomy in its outlook for the US economy because of the combined challenges of slow growth and soaring commodity prices .
The Fed is predicting that unemployment and inflation will be higher than expected .
Oil prices are expected to continue rising rapidly after hitting a third record in a row yesterday , as demand continues to outstrip supply .
· This article was amended on Wednesday June 4 2008 .
The last line in this article said : " Oil prices are expected to continue rising rapidly after hitting a third record in a row yesterday , as supply continues to outstrip demand . "
We meant to say " as demand continues to outstrip supply " .
This has been corrected .
Iran-Contra 's ' Lost Chapter '
As historians ponder George W. Bush ’s disastrous presidency , they may wonder how Republicans perfected a propaganda system that could fool tens of millions of Americans , intimidate Democrats , and transform the vaunted Washington press corps from watchdogs to lapdogs .

To understand this extraordinary development , historians might want to look back at the 1980s and examine the Iran - Contra scandal ’s “ lost chapter , ” a narrative describing how Ronald Reagan ’s administration brought CIA tactics to bear domestically to reshape the way Americans perceived the world .
That chapter – which we are publishing here for the first time – was “ lost ” because Republicans on the congressional Iran - Contra investigation waged a rear - guard fight that traded elimination of the chapter ’s key findings for the votes of three moderate GOP senators , giving the final report a patina of bipartisanship .
Under that compromise , a few segments of the draft chapter were inserted in the final report ’s Executive Summary and in another section on White House private fundraising , but the chapter ’s conclusions and its detailed account of how the “ perception management ” operation worked ended up on the editing room floor .
The American people thus were spared the chapter ’s troubling finding : that the Reagan administration had built a domestic covert propaganda apparatus managed by a CIA propaganda and disinformation specialist working out of the National Security Council .
“ One of the CIA ’s most senior covert action operators was sent to the NSC in 1983 by CIA Director [ William ]
Casey where he participated in the creation of an inter-agency public diplomacy mechanism that included the use of seasoned intelligence specialists , ” the chapter ’s conclusion stated .
“ This public / private network set out to accomplish what a covert CIA operation in a foreign country might attempt – to sway the media , the Congress , and American public opinion in the direction of the Reagan administration ’s policies . ”
However , with the chapter ’s key findings deleted , the right - wing domestic propaganda operation not only survived the Iran - Contra fallout but thrived .
So did some of the administration ’s collaborators , such as South Korean theocrat Sun Myung Moon and Australian press mogul Rupert Murdoch , two far - right media barons who poured billions of dollars into pro-Republican news outlets that continue to influence Washington ’s political debates to this day .
Before every presidential election , Moon ’s Washington Times plants derogatory – and often false – stories about Democratic contenders , discrediting them and damaging their chances of winning the White House .
For instance , in 1988 , the Times published a bogus account suggesting that the Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis had undergone psychiatric treatment .
In 2000 , Moon ’s newspaper pushed the theme that Al Gore suffered from clinical delusions .
[ For details , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
As for Murdoch , his giant News Corp. expanded into American cable TV with the founding of Fox News in 1996 .
Since then , the right - wing network has proved highly effective in promoting attack lines against Democrats or anyone else who challenges the Republican power structure .
As President George W. Bush herded the nation toward war with Iraq in 2002 - 03 , Fox News acted like his sheep dogs making sure public opinion did n’t stray too far off .
The “ Fox effect ” was so powerful that it convinced other networks to load up with pro-war military analysts and to silence voices that questioned the invasion .
[ See Neck Deep . ]
Seeds of Propaganda
The seeds of this private / public collaboration can be found in the 84 - page draft Iran - Contra chapter , entitled “ Launching the Private Network . ”
[ There appear to have been several versions of this “ lost chapter . ”
This one I found in congressional files . ]
The chapter traces the origins of the propaganda network to President Reagan ’s “ National Security Decision Directive 77 ” in January 1983 as his administration sought to promote its foreign policy , especially its desire to oust Nicaragua ’s leftist Sandinista government .
In a Jan. 13 , 1983 , memo , then - National Security Advisor William Clark foresaw the need for non-governmental money to advance this cause .
“ We will develop a scenario for obtaining private funding , ” Clark wrote .
As administration officials began reaching out to wealthy supporters , lines against domestic propaganda soon were crossed as the operation took aim at not only at foreign audiences but at U.S. public opinion , the press and congressional Democrats who opposed funding Nicaraguan rebels , known as contras .
At the time , the contras were earning a gruesome reputation as human rights violators and terrorists .
To change this negative perception of the contras , the Reagan administration created a full - blown , clandestine propaganda operation .
“ An elaborate system of inter-agency committees was eventually formed and charged with the task of working closely with private groups and individuals involved in fundraising , lobbying campaigns and propagandistic activities aimed at influencing public opinion and governmental action , ” the draft chapter said .
Heading this operation was a veteran CIA officer named Walter Raymond Jr. , who was recruited by another CIA officer , Donald Gregg , before Gregg shifted from his job as chief of the NSC ’s Intelligence Directorate to become national security adviser to then - Vice President George H.W. Bush .
[ The draft chapter does n’t use Raymond ’s name in its opening pages , apparently because some of the information came from classified depositions .
However , Raymond ’s name is used later in the chapter and the earlier citations match Raymond ’s role . ]
According to the draft report , the CIA officer recruited for the NSC job had served as Director of the Covert Action Staff at the CIA from 1978 to 1982 and was a “ specialist in propaganda and disinformation . ”
“ The CIA official [ Raymond ] discussed the transfer with [ CIA Director William ] Casey and NSC Advisor William Clark that he be assigned to the NSC as Gregg ’s successor [ in June 1982 ] and received approval for his involvement in setting up the public diplomacy program along with his intelligence responsibilities , ” the chapter said .
“ In the early part of 1983 , documents obtained by the Select [ Iran - Contra ]
Committees indicate that the Director of the Intelligence Staff of the NSC [ Raymond ] successfully recommended the establishment of an inter-governmental network to promote and manage a public diplomacy plan designed to create support for Reagan Administration policies at home and abroad . ”
Raymond “ helped to set up an elaborate system of inter-agency committees , ” the draft chapter said , adding : “ In the Spring of 1983 , the network began to turn its attention toward beefing up the Administration ’s capacity to promote American support for the Democratic Resistance in Nicaragua [ the contras ] and the fledgling democracy in El Salvador .
“ This effort resulted in the creation of the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean in the Department of State ( S/ LPD ) , headed by Otto Reich , ” a right - wing Cuban exile from Miami .
Though Secretary of State George Shultz wanted the office under his control , President Reagan insisted that Reich “ report directly to the NSC , ” where Raymond oversaw the operations as a special assistant to the President and the NSC ’s director of international communications , the chapter said .
“ At least for several months after he assumed this position , Raymond also worked on intelligence matters at the NSC , including drafting a Presidential Finding for Covert Action in Nicaragua in mid-September ” 1983 , the chapter said .
In other words , although Raymond was shifted to the NSC staff in part to evade prohibitions on the CIA influencing U.S. public opinion , his intelligence and propaganda duties overlapped for a time as he was retiring from the spy agency .
Key Player Despite Raymond ’s formal separation from the CIA , he acted toward the U.S. public much like a CIA officer would in directing a propaganda operation in a hostile foreign country .
He was the go - to guy to keep the operation on track .
“ Reich relied heavily on Raymond to secure personnel transfers from other government agencies to beef up the limited resources made available to S / LPD by the Department of State , ” the chapter said .
“ Personnel made available to the new office included intelligence specialists from the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army .
On one occasion , five intelligence experts from the Army ’s 4th Psychological Operations Group at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , were assigned to work with Reich ’s fast - growing operation . …
“ White House documents also indicate that CIA Director Casey had more than a passing interest in the Central American public diplomacy campaign . ”
The chapter cited an Aug. 9 , 1983 , memo written by Raymond describing Casey ’s participation in a meeting with public relations specialists to brainstorm how “ to sell a ‘ new product ’ – Central America – by generating interest across - the - spectrum . ”
In an Aug. 29 , 1983 , memo , Raymond recounted a call from Casey pushing his P.R. ideas .
Alarmed at a CIA director participating so brazenly in domestic propaganda , Raymond wrote that “ I philosophized a bit with Bill Casey ( in an effort to get him out of the loop ) ” but with little success .
The chapter added : “ Casey ’s involvement in the public diplomacy effort apparently continued throughout the period under investigation by the Committees , ” including a 1985 role in pressuring Congress to renew contra aid and a 1986 hand in further shielding S/ LPD from the oversight of Secretary Shultz .
A Raymond - authored memo to Casey in August 1986 described the shift of S / LPD – then run by neoconservative theorist Bob Kagan who had replaced Reich – to the control of the Bureau of Inter - American Affairs , which was headed by Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams , another prominent neoconservative .
Another important figure in the pro-contra propaganda was NSC staffer Oliver North , who spent a great deal of his time on the Nicaraguan public diplomacy operation even though he is better known for arranging secret arms shipments to the contras and to Iran ’s radical Islamic government , leading to the Iran - Contra scandal .
The draft chapter cited a March 10 , 1985 , memo from North describing his assistance to CIA Director Casey in timing disclosures of pro-contra news “ aimed at securing Congressional approval for renewed support to the Nicaraguan Resistance Forces . ”
North ’s Operatives The Iran - Contra “ lost ” chapter depicts a sometimes Byzantine network of contract and private operatives who handled details of the domestic propaganda while concealing the hand of the White House and the CIA .
“ Richard R. Miller , former head of public affairs at AID , and Francis D. Gomez , former public affairs specialist at the State Department and USIA , were hired by S / LPD through sole - source , no - bid contracts to carry out a variety of activities on behalf of the Reagan administration policies in Central America , ” the chapter said .
“ Supported by the State Department and White House , Miller and Gomez became the outside managers of [ North operative ] Spitz Channel ’s fundraising and lobbying activities .
“ They also served as the managers of Central American political figures , defectors , Nicaraguan opposition leaders and Sandinista atrocity victims who were made available to the press , the Congress and private groups , to tell the story of the Contra cause . ”
Miller and Gomez facilitated transfers of money to Swiss and offshore banks at North ’s direction , as they “ became the key link between the State Department and the Reagan White House with the private groups and individuals engaged in a myriad of endeavors aimed at influencing the Congress , the media and public opinion , ” the chapter said .
In its conclusion , the draft chapter read : “ The State Department was used to run a prohibited , domestic , covert propaganda operation .
Established despite resistance from the Secretary of State , and reporting directly to the NSC , the [ S / LPD ] attempted to mask many of its activities from the Congress and the American people . ”
However , the American people never got to read a detailed explanation of this finding nor see the evidence .
In October 1987 , as the congressional Iran - Contra committees wrote their final report , Republicans protested the inclusion of this explosive information .
Though the Democrats held the majority , the GOP had leverage because Rep. Lee Hamilton , D - Indiana , the House chairman , wanted some bipartisanship in the final report , especially since senior Republicans , including Rep. Dick Cheney , R- Wyoming , were preparing a strongly worded minority report .
Hamilton and the Democrats hoped that three moderate Republicans – William Cohen of Maine , Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Paul Trible of Virginia – would break ranks and sign the majority report .
However , the Republicans objected to the draft chapter about Ronald Reagan ’s covert propaganda campaign .
As part of a compromise , some elements of the draft chapter were included in the Executive Summary but without much detail and shorn of the tough conclusions .
Nevertheless , Cohen protested even that .
“ I question the inordinate attention devoted in the Executive Summary to the Office of Public Diplomacy and its activities in support of the Administration ’s polices , ” Cohen wrote in his additional views .
“ The prominence given to it in the Executive Summary is far more generous than just . ”
Long - Term Consequences
However , the failure of the Iran - Contra report to fully explain the danger of CIA - style propaganda intruding into the U.S. political process would have profound future consequences .
Indeed , the evidence suggests that today ’s powerful right - wing media gained momentum as part of the Casey - Raymond operations of the early 1980s .
According to one Raymond - authored memo dated Aug. 9 , 1983 , then - U.S. Information Agency director Charles Wick “ via Murdock [ sic ] may be able to draw down added funds ” to support pro-Reagan initiatives .
Raymond ’s reference to Rupert Murdoch possibly drawing down “ added funds ” suggests that the right - wing media mogul was already part of the covert propaganda operation .
In line with its clandestine nature , Raymond also suggested routing the “ funding via Freedom House or some other structure that has credibility in the political center . ”
Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon , publisher of the Washington Times , also showed up in the Iran - Contra operations , using his newspaper to raise contra funds and assigning his CAUSA political group to organize support for the contras .
In the two decades since the Iran - Contra scandal , both Murdoch and Moon have continued to pour billions of dollars into media outlets that have influenced the course of U.S. history , often through the planting of propaganda and disinformation much like a CIA covert action might do in a hostile foreign country .
Further , to soften up the Washington press corps , Reich ’s S / LPD targeted U.S. journalists who reported information that undermined the pro-contra propaganda .
Reich sent his teams out to lobby news executives to remove or punish out - of - step reporters – with a disturbing degree of success .
[ For more , see Parry ’s Lost History . ]
Some U.S. officials implicated in the Iran - Contra propaganda operations are still around , bringing the lessons of the 1980s into the new century .
For instance , Elliott Abrams .
Though convicted of misleading Congress in the Iran - Contra Affair and later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush – Abrams is now deputy adviser to George W. Bush ’s NSC , where he directs U.S. - Middle East policy .
Bob Kagan remains another prominent neocon theorist in Washington , writing op - eds for the Washington Post .
Oliver North was given a news show on Fox .
Otto Reich now is advising Republican presidential candidate John McCain on Latin American affairs .
Lee Hamilton is a senior national security adviser to Democratic candidate Barack Obama .
Enduring Skills
Beyond these individuals , the manipulative techniques that were refined in the 1980s – especially the skill of exaggerating foreign threats – have proved durable , bringing large segments of the American population into line behind the Iraq War in 2002 - 03 .
Only now – with more than 4,100 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead – are many of these Americans realizing that were manipulated by clever propaganda , that their perceptions had been managed .
For instance , the New York Times recently pried loose some 8,000 pages of Pentagon documents revealing how the Bush administration had manipulated the public debate on the Iraq War by planting friendly retired military officers on TV news shows .
Retired Green Beret Robert S. Bevelacqua , a former analyst on Murdoch ’s Fox News , said the Pentagon treated the retired military officers as puppets : “ It was them saying , ‘ we need to stick our hands up your back and move your mouth for you . ’ ”
[ NYT , April 20 , 2008 , or see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ US News Media ’s Latest Disgrace . ” ]
Bush ’s former White House press secretary Scott McClellan described similar use of propaganda tactics to justify the Iraq War in his book , What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception .
From his insider vantage point , McClellan cited the White House ’s “ carefully orchestrated campaign to shape and manipulate sources of public approval ” – and he called the Washington press corps “ complicit enablers . ”
None of this would have been so surprising – indeed Americans might have been forewarned and forearmed – if Lee Hamilton and other Democrats on the Iran - Contra committees had held firm and published the scandal ’s “ lost chapter ” two decades ago .
Robert Parry broke many of the Iran - Contra stories in the 1980s for the Associated Press and Newsweek .

Troops struggle with 10 - foot Afghan marijuana plants
OTTAWA - Canadian troops fighting Taliban militants in Afghanistan have stumbled across an unexpected and potent enemy — almost impenetrable forests of 10 - foot - tall marijuana plants .
Gen . Rick Hillier , chief of the Canadian defense staff , said Thursday that Taliban fighters were using the forests as cover .
In response , the crew of at least one armored car had camouflaged their vehicle with marijuana .
" The challenge is that marijuana plants absorb energy , heat very readily .
It 's very difficult to penetrate with thermal devices ... and as a result you really have to be careful that the Taliban do n't dodge in and out of those marijuana forests , " he said in a speech in Ottawa .
" We tried burning them with white phosphorus — it did n't work .
We tried burning them with diesel — it did n't work .
The plants are so full of water right now ... that we simply could n't burn them , " he said .
Even successful incineration had its drawbacks .
" A couple of brown plants on the edges of some of those ( forests ) did catch on fire .
But a section of soldiers that was downwind from that had some ill effects and decided that was probably not the right course of action , " Hillier said dryly .
One soldier told him later : " Sir , three years ago before I joined the army , I never thought I 'd say ' That damn marijuana . '

It 's obvious that there has been a little research performed by the taliban .
Just the same mechanism which aids in the detection of marijuana also contributed in this case to concealment of troops within them .
Clever planning on the rebel side .
This makes me wonder how long they had this planned if they had this planned at all .
It would take at LEAST 9 mo .
of some really decent care to get fluffy and tall plants to provide concealment .
On the plus side of such an effort would be infra-red and thermal camouflage , well worth it .
I 'm pretty impressed .

yes , in fact , we should remove people 's civil rights in this country AND murder people in other countries to get that job done !

" To do right is to know what you want .
Now when you are dissatisfied with yourself it's because you are after something you do n't really want .
What objects are you proposing to yourself ?
Are they the objects you really value ?
If they are not , you are cheating yourself .
I do n't meant that if you chose to pursue the objects you most value , you will attain them ; of course not .
Your experience will tell you that .
But success in getting after much labor what you really do n't care for is the bitterest and most ridiculous failure . "

In Los Angeles ’ rarefied world of private schools , where tuitions are high , academics are tough and educational philosophy is taken seriously , the newest member of the tribe is getting the kind of breathless attention reserved for a music or film star .
That may be because the founders of New Village Academy are themselves such stars : Will Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith .
Entertainers have long flocked to private schools on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley , where campuses are comparatively small , offer a discreet environment and are close to studios .
The Smiths , however , will be among the few celebrities -- Oprah Winfrey , Andre Agassi and Tiger Woods among them -- to establish their own school or program .
It is one of several initiatives by the couple , including a new foundation that will give grants to young people in the arts and education .
About 80 % of New Village students will receive financial assistance in the fall .

But the school ’s Sept. 3 opening , on the leased campus of a former school in Calabasas , will be accompanied by a whiff of controversy .
Some of its teachers are members of the Church of Scientology , and it will use teaching methods developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard .
That has provoked a slew of headlines : On FOXNews.com , “ Will Smith Funds Private Scientology School ” ; from Britain ’s The Guardian , “ Will Smith funds school teaching Scientology creator ’s study method ” ; and on the religion blog of the Dallas Morning News , “ Is Will Smith school a front for Scientology ? ”
Both Smiths have said they are not Scientologists .
In a statement , Will Smith said of the school : “ About 10 years ago , Jada and I started dreaming about the possibility of creating an ideal educational environment , where children could feel happy , positive and excited about learning .
. . .

“ New Village Academy was born of a simple question , ‘ Is it possible to create an educational environment in which children have fun learning ? ’
Jada and I believe the answer is ‘ Yes . ’ ”
New Village Academy began about three years ago as a home school for the Smiths ’ youngest children -- Jaden , 9 and Willow , 7 -- and those of several other families .
After an extensive search , Jacqueline Olivier , previously an administrator at private schools in Santa Monica and La Jolla , was hired to head the school .
Since joining the school a year ago , she has been responsible for hiring staff and preparing for the opening of the new campus .
Olivier responded to written questions about the school submitted through Will Smith ’s publicist .
She said some staff members are Scientologists and others are Muslim , Christian or Jewish .
The school has no religious affiliation , she said .

“ We are a secular school and just like all nonreligious independent schools , faculty and staff do not promote their own religions at school or pass on the beliefs of their particular faith to children , ” Olivier said .
One teaching method the school uses is study technology , which was developed by Hubbard and focuses on students gaining hands - on experience , mastering subject matter before moving to the next level , and being taught not to read past words they do n’t understand .
“ People tend to think study technology is a subject , but it is really just the way the subject is taught , ” Olivier said .
“ They then come to the conclusion that we are teaching Scientology when actually a methodology does n’t have anything to do with content . ”
The school , she said , will use many philosophies , including Montessori , Bruner and Gardner .
Olivier said the Smiths would pay nearly $ 900,000 to lease the Indian Hills High School campus in the Las Virgenes Unified School District for three years .
Fall enrollment is expected to be about 40 students and will eventually rise to about 100 , she said .
The school will include pre-kindergarten through sixth grade , with a top annual tuition of $ 12,500 .

The school ’s executive director is Jana Babatunde - Bey , who worked as general manager of Smith ’s Overbrook Entertainment and is currently director of philanthropy and vice president of the Smith Holdings Group , according to the school ’s website .
New Village plans to have nonprofit status , as well as accreditation from the California Assn. of Independent Schools , which demands strict accountability and an on - site visit by a team of educators .
The success of a new school is not guaranteed , noted association Executive Director Jim McManus .
Many fail after a few years , and it remains to be seen how the Smith cachet will affect enrollment .
Olivier is a respected educator , McManus said .
“ I think she ’s really energetic , hardworking and in tune with evolving research and responsible trends in education , ” he said .

The New Village curriculum includes literacy and math , and subjects such as living skills , Spanish , karate , yoga , robotics , technology , etiquette and art .
Parental involvement is encouraged , as is limited access to television and sugary foods .
But critics contend that the school is not being honest about its links to Scientology .
David S. Touretzky , a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University , created a website that dissects study technology and asserts that it is Scientology religion disguised as education .
Touretzky said many phrases and concepts on the school ’s website are specific to Scientology .
For example , the school lists a “ Director of Qualifications ” and another teacher who is an assistant in the “ Qual ” department .
The “ Qual , ” said Touretzky , is where people who have completed a Scientology counseling , or “ auditing , ” session or a course in the Church of Scientology are tested by a qualifications teacher .
“ There is no reputable educator anywhere who endorses [ study technology ] , ” said Touretzky , a vocal critic of Scientology .
“ What happens is that children are inculcated with Scientology jargon and are led to regard L.R. Hubbard as an authority figure .
They are laying the groundwork for later bringing people into Scientology . ”

A spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology , Karin Pouw , denied Touretzky ’s assertions and said the teaching methods are not religious and are widely used in schools around the world .
Ron Reynolds , executive director of the California Assn. of Private School Organizations , which represents primarily independent religious schools , said all schools should strive for transparency .
“ I know next to nothing about Scientology , but if you ’re using some method or technology closely associated with Scientology and Scientology is characterized as a church or religious body , it raises a question if they proclaim themselves as other than religious , ” Reynolds said .
He has not seen the school ’s website .
“ I do n’t want to insinuate the school is failing to disclose anything .
But as a matter of good practice , if a school has an affiliation , it would behoove it to expose it . ”

A shocking 34 percent of mothers reported having had an extramarital affair after the birth of their children , according to a study released yesterday .
More than half , 53 percent , of women polled in the “ Sex and the American Mom ” survey also said they had entertained the idea of straying on their spouses .
“ That ’s a far cry from just fantasizing about it , which I think is an important distinction , ” said Pilar Guzman , editor - in - chief of Cookie magazine , which conducted the survey in conjunction with the “ AOL Body ” Web site .
“ They ’re thinking ‘ when and how can I do this ? ’ ”
Celebrities whom moms would most like to romp with included acting hunk George Clooney , Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Ironically , Obama ’s appeal to married moms probably stems from his perception as a family man , said Guzman .
“ He seems like such a great dad and husband .
Rather than going for the bad boy , they are fantasizing about the ideal husband , ” she said .
The poll – conducted online in the past six months – quizzed 30,000 mothers .
It ’s not just women who are cheating .
Almost half of the women polled – 48 percent – said they suspect their hubbies have had or are having an affair .
“ The somewhat startling statistics invite a closer look at the state of sex and the American marriage , ” Guzman said .
“ We are trying to get at the problems of marriage , which often play out in the bedroom . ”
Indeed , more than half of the women reported feeling inhibited in the boudoir when their children are at home .
Only 36 percent said their attraction to their husband is the same as when they married him .
Sex ranks at the bottom of most women ’s list of tensions , below other high - stress topics such as money , in - laws and raising the youngsters .
But most women just do n’t think they ’re getting enough .
A considerable 77 percent of the women said they want more sex and 29 percent said they ’d rather get more action in the sack than lose 10 pounds .
“ The intent and the desire to have desire [ for their husbands ] is there .
That to me seems like the most optimistic piece of the survey , ” said Guzman .
One way lots of those ladies are keeping the home fires stoked is porn .
Nearly a quarter of the respondents ‘ fessed up to looking at dirty pics and movies .
Another 21 percent use booze to get in the swing of things , and 17 percent like fantasy play .

It is not clear whether or not foul play was involved A military show in southern France has left 17 people wounded , after real bullets were used instead of blanks .
The injured included five children .
Four people , including one child , were said to have been seriously hurt - though three have now stabilised .
The incident occurred during a public demonstration of hostage - freeing techniques at a barracks in Aude .
The soldier who fired the shots has been detained - though an official said it was probably an accident .
It is not clear why the wrong ammunition was used in Sunday 's demonstration .
But it was " 99.9 % " likely to be " an unintentional fault , " Colonel Benoit Royal , head of the French army 's information service , told the AFP news agency on Monday .
' No psychological problems '
However , Defence Minister Herve Morin said : " I can not rule out anything because we do n't know what might be going on in a man 's head . "
He said " an experienced soldier " should not be able to confuse blanks with real bullets .
" According to initial findings of the inquiry , the incident involved a soldier with a perfect record , who had participated in operations and had seven to eight years of experience , " he said .
" There is nothing that would make one think he had behavioural or psychological problems , " he added .
Reports from the scene say the hostage scenario had been acted out five times before a crowd at the Laperrine military barracks , near Carcassonne , when on the sixth take real bullets began flying through the air , and onlookers fell to the ground .
Fifteen civilians were among the 17 injured .
Gilles Hulard , a doctor from Carcassonne 's rescue service said : " The condition of patients injured the most seriously have stabilised , including that of a three - year - old child very seriously injured , who seems to be improving . "
He said the worst injuries were sustained by a man shot in the chest , who was still in critical condition . "
In a statement , French President Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his horror at the incident and said he was urgently waiting for the results of an official investigation .
The president was planning to visit the injured in hospitals in Carcassonne and Toulouse later , his office said .

On Wednesday , Joe Lieberman wrote on this page that the Democratic Party he and I grew up in has drifted far from the foreign policy espoused by Franklin Roosevelt , Harry Truman and John Kennedy .
In fact , it is the policies that President George W. Bush has pursued , and that John McCain would continue , that are divorced from that great tradition – and from the legacy of Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush .

I finally figured out a business model for Twitter .
It ’s advertising based and it only works if Twitter does n’t solve their scaling problems .
The way I see it , the most the Twitter user base needs Twitter to be running smoothly is about fourteen hours a day .
That leaves ten hours a day of those cute “ please try again later ” screens .
As long as they can continue to add more people than they lose every day , I could see what I have in mind being a sustainable stream of income .
Any large ad network — like Overture , Federated Media or AOL — would jump at the chance to get their pool of advertisers in front of this eternally patient , gullible audience .
I totally deserve a Twitter board seat for this .
MAASTRICHT , Netherlands ( AFP ) - Romantic human - robot relationships are no longer the stuff of science fiction -- researchers expect them to become reality within four decades .
And they do not mean simply , mechanical sex .
" I am talking about loving relationships about 40 years from now , " David Levy , author of the book " Love + sex with robots " , told AFP at an international conference held last week at the University of Maastricht in the south - east of the country .
" ... when there are robots that have also emotions , personality , consciousness .
They can talk to you , they can make you laugh .
They can ... say they love you just like a human would say ' I love you ' , and say it as though they mean it ... "
Robots as sex toys should already be on the market within five years , predicted Levy , " a sort of an upgrade of the sex dolls on sale now " .
These would have electronic speech and sensors that make them utter " nice sounds " when a human caresses their " erogenous zones " .
But to build robots as real partners would take a bit longer , with conversation skills being the main obstacle for developers .
Scientists were working on artificial personality , emotion and consciousness , said Levy , and some robots already appear lifelike .
" But for loving relationships -- that is something completely different .
In loving relationships there are many more things that are important .
And the most difficult of all is conversation .
" You want your robot to be able to talk to you about what is interesting to you .
You want a partner who has some similar interest to you , who talks to you in a manner that pleases you , who has a similar sense of humour to you . "
The field of human - computer conversation is crucial to building robots with whom humans could fall in love , but is lagging behind other areas of development , said the author .
" I am sure it will ( happen . )
In 40 years ... perhaps sooner .
You will find robots , conversation partners , that will talk to you and you will get as much pleasure from it as talking to another human .
I am sure of it . "
Levy 's bombshell thesis , whose publication has had a ripple - effect way beyond the scientific community , gives rise to a number of complicated ethical and relationship questions .
British scholar Dylan Evans pointed out the paradox inherent to any relationship with a robot .
" What is absolutely crucial to the sentiment of love , is the belief that the love is neither unconditional nor eternal .
" Robots can not choose you , they can not reject you .
That could become very boring , and one can imagine the human becoming cruel against his defenseless partner " , said Evans .
A robot could conceivably be programmed with a will of its own and the ability to reject his human partner , he said , " but that would be a very difficult robot to sell " .
Some warn against being overhasty .
" Let us not exaggerate the possibilities ! " said Dutch researcher Vincent Wiegel of the Technological University of the eastern town of Delft .
" Today , the artificial intelligence we are able to create is that of a child of one year of age . "
But Levy is unyielding .
He is convinced it will happen , and predicts many societal benefits .
" There are many millions of people in the world who have nobody .
They might be shy or they might have some psychological hang - ups or psycho - sexual hang - ups , they might have personality problems , they might be ugly ...
" There will always be many millions of people who cannot make normal satisfactory relationships with humans , and for them the choice is not : ' would I prefer a relationship with a human or would I prefer a relationship with a robot ? ' -- the choice is no relationship at all or a relationship with a robot . "
They might even become human - to - human relationship savers , he predicted .
" Certainly there will be some existing human - human relationships where one partner might say to the other partner : ' if you have sex with a robot I 'm leaving you ' .
" There will be others who say : ' when you go on your business trip please take your robot because I happen to worry about the red light district ' . "

My war against Army sexists was WORSE than being held hostage and nearly executed in Iraq
By Barbara Davies for the Daily Mail
She 's the lawyer who became an Army poster girl and , in a terrifying ordeal , helped a male officer rescue two SAS men from an Iraqi mob .
He got an MC .
She got a hug ... and a lesser job .
Here , she explains why she decided to take on the top brass
Rabia Siddique was once regarded as the perfect poster girl for the British Army .
Her photograph , reprinted on thousands of recruitment posters , helped dispel all the worst myths about the armed forces .
Not just a woman officer , but an attractive one , too .
She was also a Muslim .
Rabia , a high - flying military lawyer and recipient of the Queen 's Commendation for Valuable Service , certainly ticked all the right boxes .
And despite never being trained in close combat , when she was put to the test in Iraq , the 36 - year - old proved to be remarkably courageous .
Rabia Siddique has accepted an out of court settlement from the MOD regarding sex and race discrimination against her
Helicoptered into a Basra police compound where two kidnapped SAS soldiers were being held , she battled for hours to save their lives , using her legal expertise and her Arabic to negotiate with their captors .
And when the Iraqis turned an AK47 on her and another officer , she stayed calm - even when her colleague screamed and dived for cover .
She was taunted and called a ' whore ' by Iraqis holding the hostage , but refused to show any sign of weakness .
And yet what she later suffered at the hands of her superiors in the British Army was , to her mind , far worse than anything that happened at Al Jameat police station on September 19 , 2005 .
While the other British officer who was with her was later awarded the Military Cross and promoted to Lieutenant Colonel , Rabia 's only reward was to be given a hug by her commanding officer and sent to her room for a good night 's sleep .
The officer who was given the MC , Major James Woodham , gave an account of that day which was later published in the book In Foreign Fields : Heroes Of Iraq and Afghanistan In Their Own Words .
Rabia 's story , however , has never been told .
Having dared to question the discrepancies between the way she and Major Woodham were treated , she found herself given a posting far beneath her rank .
On Monday , Rabia , who lectured Prince William on sexual equality during his Sandhurst officer training course , settled a race and sex discrimination case against the Ministry of Defence just minutes before her case was due to be heard at Central London employment tribunal .
In the end , it was unthinkable that the MoD would allow her highly embarrassing story to come out in such a public fashion .
They have agreed to pay her an undisclosed sum .
Meanwhile , Rabia has resigned her commission in disgust at the way the Army has treated her .
Cynics may feel Rabia is embellishing her story for her own ends .
Yet the Mail has seen the legal documents she sent to the tribunal , which corroborate what she told us this week .
Further , there was no point during the day in question in Iraq when she was not with at least one other British soldier , so she would hardly dare risk lying about her ordeal , given the high stakes of the tribunal .
And finally , she is now a government lawyer , only too aware of the repercussions of giving false testimony in this instance .
" It was never about the money , " she says , speaking about her ordeal for the first time .
" It was about making sure my role that day in Iraq was acknowledged and people were held to account for the way I was treated after . "
She is swift to emphasise that she has no axe to grind with Major Woodham .
" I have nothing against the fact that he received the Military Cross .
He played a role .
I played a role , " she says .
And yet her recollection of the terrifying events of that day suggests that at the very least , the part she played has never properly been recognised .
Born to an Indian father and Australian mother , Rabia , a British citizen , studied law before qualifying as a barrister and solicitor in 1996 .
She pursued a career in London in international law and joined the Army in 2001 as a captain in Army Legal Services .
She was promoted to Acting Major in 2004 , and in April 2005 was drafted in as legal adviser to the 12 Mechanised Brigade in Basra .
As a Muslim , Arab - speaking lawyer , Rabia played a crucial role , liaising with the local judiciary and dealing with a police force which had been infiltrated by the terrorists Jaish al Mahdi , a group who were loyal to the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
" I had a recognisable Muslim name which helped me gain a rapport with the Iraqis very quickly , " she explains .
" I wore a hijab as a sign of respect .
It was difficult work .
I had to talk to men I knew were probably responsible for killing some of our people . "
It was on September 19 , 2005 , that two plain - clothed SAS officers on counter - terrorist surveillance were illegally seized by Iraqi police officers and taken to Al Jameat police station .
Outside the compound , as temperatures soared to 120F , British troops battled to contain hundreds of angry Iraqis screaming for the execution of the men they claimed killed an Iraqi police officer .
It was just two years since six military policemen had been killed in a police station in Maysan Province and the kidnap was soon the talk of Brigade HQ .
At first Major Woodham , an army liaison officer with contacts at Al Jameat , was sent in with a team of four other officers to negotiate the captives ' release .
Soon , he radioed back to HQ for help , relaying a message from an Iraqi judge that they would only deal with the woman they knew as ' Major Rabia ' .
Rabia recalls : " I was told : ' You are being asked for .
We need you to go in there .
James is n't getting anywhere .
We need to get them out . '
I was sent in to do what they felt only I could do . "
She threw on her body armour and helmet , grabbed an SA80 rifle and loaded her weapon while waiting for a Lynx helicopter to take her to Al Jameat .
" Flying over the city was the first time I felt fear , a terrible sense of foreboding .
I was a lawyer .
I was armed , but I was n't trained in hand - to - hand combat . "
By the time she landed , it was clear the situation was getting desperate .
" The noise was deafening , " she recalls .
" The crowds were screaming and shouting .
I could see armed Iraqi officers on the roof of the police station .
Our soldiers were finding it hard to stop the crowd breaking in . "
On the steps of Al Jameat , she was met by Major Woodham and a military interpreter .
" There was a look of relief on James 's face when he saw me , " she says , " but the interpreter was panicky .
He asked if he could be excused , and Major Woodham released him . "
Inside office where she was taken , the situation was fraught .
She recalls : " It was very tense , very hostile .
I remember thinking that for the first time I was n't wearing the hijab and the men had n't seen me without it .
I felt very self - conscious .
" All sorts of accusations were flying around .
They were saying that the men they had arrested were Israeli agents , that they 'd killed an Iraqi police officer . "
Rabia was once considered the perfect poster girl for the British Army
Over the next hour , speaking in a mixture of English and Arabic , Rabia spoke to the chief legal officer in the station , Judge Ragib , a man she had worked with before , reminding him that it was illegal to detain British soldiers under the legal agreement signed by the Iraqi Provincial Government and Coalition Forces .
" I was desperate to make sure our men were alive , " she says .
Throughout , she says , Major Woodham was sitting alongside her .
" He tried to speak , " she says , " but he was told to shut up . "
At first it seemed that Rabia 's skills as a lawyer were about to pay off .
The judge and an Iraqi colonel said that Rabia would be taken to see the prisoners , along with a group of police officers .
" I recognised the officers as members of Jaish Al Mahdi , " she says .
" There was no way I was going to be split from James and I insisted he came with me . "
They were taken to the cell where the men were being held .
Rabia remembers : " They were huddled in a corner , chained up and blindfolded .
They had bloodstained T - shirts on and Iraqi uniform trousers . "
She demanded the men were unchained and their blindfolds removed .
" They dragged the men over and plonked them down on two chairs , " she says .
" I told them not to worry , that we'd get them out . "
But suddenly around 60 armed , plain - clothed police officers poured into the cell .
" My heart was pounding but I tried to focus on the judge and keep things on a legal level , " she says .
At the very moment Rabia persuaded the judge to release the men into her custody , she says , ' all hell was let loose ' .
She recalls shouting and screaming , the sound of weapons being made ready and pistols being waved in the air .
Outside , she could see smoke and fire and hear gunshots and explosions .
" Our two soldiers were grabbed , chained and blindfolded .
James and I were thrown out of the cell , and I had this sickening fear that they were about to execute the two men .
I tried to carry on talking to the judge but I could see fear on his face .
He looked at me and said : " I 'm sorry .
It 's no longer in my hands . "
That was the last time I saw him .
Once he had gone , I felt control slipping through my fingers .
I was afraid , but mostly I was frightened for the two men .
I demanded to be taken back into the cell with them . '
But the situation went from bad to worse .
Rabia and Major Woodham were herded into a tiny office , filled with more police officers , Iraqi community elders and groups of angry men who surged in and out , screaming insults at the two British officers .
Then , a group of men burst into the room .
" One was waving an AK47 , " says Rabia .
" He was shouting in Arabic that his relative had been shot outside by British soldiers .
He was wailing and screaming .
Everything happened very quickly .
James and I were standing side by side .
This man turned to us and he cocked the AK47 straight at us and pulled back on the lever like he was going to shoot .
" I thought that was it .
You always wonder how you will deal with a situation like that , but I went completely cold .
I was staring at him and waiting for the shot . "
She is clearly uncomfortable recounting what happened next , mainly out of loyalty to Major Woodham .
Tribunal documents setting out Rabia 's case say that 'at one stage Major Woodham hid behind the claimant ' .
All Rabia will say is : " I remember James screaming " No ! " and diving .
Everyone reacts in those situations differently .'
" The gunman looked at James first - then he looked at me and a different look crossed his face .
To this day , I 'm convinced he did n't fire that weapon because there was a woman in the room . "
In the chaotic scenes that followed , the man was thrown out of the office by other Iraqis .
" From that moment on , " admits Rabia , " my main concern was getting out alive . "
Not long after , four British soldiers , part of the original team brought in by Major Woodham , were thrown into the room and after being moved to yet another office , Rabia continued speaking in Arabic , trying to persuade the Iraqis to release them .
" I tried being jovial , but they started calling me a whore and a betrayer .
There was a real sense of aggression in the room , but now it was directed at me . "
Just how much of a hostile target Rabia had become was soon made obvious .
" We 'd been in there for some time by then , and James was dying to go to the loo , " she says .
" A couple of police officers escorted him outside to the toilet block .
" At this stage , I asked if I could also go .
They just laughed at me and said if I wanted to go I 'd have to go right there .
" I said I 'd go with one of the officers but the Iraqis said : ' Only whores go to the toilet with men .
If you want to go , go here . '
In the end , I knew I 'd have to wet myself .
" The other British guys were fantastic .
They could see how agitated I was and they just turned their backs and talked among themselves .
It was a hideous thing to have to do and deeply humiliating , but I did my best not to show it . "
At around 9 pm , nearly ten hours after entering the station , Rabia and the five other officers were finally released and picked up by British Warrior armoured vehicles .
" We were probably freed at this point , " explains Rabia , " because the two captive SAS officers had been moved .
There was an incredible sense of relief , ' she says , " but we were still completely focused on finding the other two . "
Army intelligence experts quickly located the two British SAS soldiers , who were being held in a house not far from Al Jameat , and sent the Warriors to get them .
" We were in the nick of time , " says Rabia .
" They had been badly beaten .
Their clothes had been removed , as had their underwear , which is what usually happens to prisoners about to be executed .
One of them came into our tank .
" There was lots of hand - shaking and a huge sense of relief .
One minute you think you are going to die , the next , it 's all over .
I do n't think my emotions kicked in until a lot later .
Pure survival instinct took over .
I just tried to hold it together . "
Back at HQ in the early hours of the morning , the group were given sweet tea and sandwiches and then separated .
While Major Woodham was debriefed about his ordeal - regarded as highly therapeutic and essential , in military circles - Rabia was given a hug by her commanding officer , Brigadier Lorimer .
She felt patronised by that , but tried to put it out of her head and was initially delighted when , in March 2006 , she heard she had been awarded the Queen 's Commendation For Valuable Service .
It was not as prestigious an award as the Military Cross , which she discovered had been awarded to Major Woodham for his role in the action , but she thought that her role in the Jameat incident had finally been recognised .
She even wrote to Brigadier Lorimer to thank him .
It was n't until a year later that Rabia discovered she had been recommended for the QCVS long before the incident .
Initially , she complained informally to her commanding officer , but was advised by senior officers not to pursue her complaint any further .
One told her that ' inevitable stigma is attached to those who [ seek ] redress ' .
But when nothing was done , she lodged a formal complaint in May 2007 .
Two months later , she was given the UK posting of a job she 'd done three years previously - an obvious step backwards in her career .
Disgusted at the way she had been treated , Rabia finally resigned in December last year .
Given what she went through , it is easy to understand her anger - all the more so in the light of Major Woodham 's medal .
His Military Cross citation read : " In an exceptionally dangerous and unstable situation , with himself and his team held at gunpoint and threatened , Woodham provided a cool head and calm leadership , despite the imminent danger to life ; one mistake could have triggered a bloodbath , but this was prevented by his courageous leadership and exceptional presence of mind in the face of extreme danger . "
Rabia 's achievements that day have never been recognised .
This week , an MoD spokesman was quick to point out that while Rabia 's claim has been settled , no liability has been admitted .
In the end , however , her account of that day in Al Jameat speaks for itself .
At home in the village near Salisbury in Wiltshire where she lives with her RAF officer husband Tony , Rabia is surrounded by remnants of the Army career she loved .
There are photographs of her in uniform , while a military jacket still hangs on the back of a door .
Officially , she is on annual leave , waiting for her resignation to be ratified .
In a couple of weeks she will take up a new job , working as a lawyer for a Government department in Central London .
By standing up to the Army and forcing them to address what she regards as its latent sexism she has , in a sense , transformed herself into a poster girl of a very different kind - a woman prepared to sacrifice her military career in the hope that other high - flying female officers do n't have to suffer what she did .
She treasures a letter she received this week from the head of the Army , General Sir Richard Dannatt .
He wrote : " The Army will consider carefully your perception of the way that you were treated in the period that followed the Al Jameat incident with a view to ensuring that appropriate lessons are learned . "
If they are , says Rabia , she will feel it has been worth it .
" That 's what I was seeking by bringing these claims in the first place . "
Some might say she deserves a medal for her resolve in fighting this battle alone .
Rabia was once considered the perfect poster girl for the British Army

How may I help you ? ”
Guest : “ Hi , yes , I ’m calling because your hotel charged our credit card twice ? ”
Me : “ Okay , ma’am .

Guest : * morphs into an uber - witch in three seconds flat *
“ Straightened out ?
D*** right you ’re going to get this straightened out !
You charged enough for that crappy little room !
I ’ll be d***ed if we ’re paying for it twice !

Me : “ I ’m sorry , ma’am , but if I can just have your name and the date you stayed – ”
Guest : “ That ’s just it !
I was charged on two separate DATES .
My name is [ Guest ] and my husband and I stayed there on June 9th .
There ’s another charge on there for the 17th .
I want this fixed ! ”
Me : “ Yes , ma’am .
I understand .
I ’m looking now , ma’am …
Okay , I see the problem .
You did stay here on the 9th of June .
I ’m showing that someone by the name of [ Husband ] stayed on the 17th . ”
( There ’s dead silence for a moment , and then whispering . )
Guest : “ What ? ”
( At this point my stomach falls into my shoes , because I can hear her mind ticking away , and I know something she does n’t : another name is listed on the screen with her husband ’s for the June 17th stay , and it ’s NOT HERS . )
Me : “ Um … ma’am ? ”
Guest : “ I see .
You ’ve been very helpful . ”
Me : “ Thank you , ma’am .
Can I help you with anything else today ? ”
( At this moment the woman drops the phone but does not hang up , and I hear her begin to scream at someone , swearing in combos I never would have thought up .
I hang up quickly and try to go about my business , making a note of it to tell my boss .
Later I get another phone call . )
Me : “ Thank you for calling .
How – ”
Guest ’s Husband : “ I want to talk to your manager , you stupid little b****!
You probably just cost me my marriage and I am going to sue your s***- hole hotel for every penny it ’s worth !
Do you hear me ?
Do you ? ! ”

Dr. Smith and other cardiologists say the main problem is that there is no way to figure out who has “ vulnerable plaques , ” those prone to rupture .
Researchers are trying to find biomarkers , substances in the blood that can show the presence of these dangerous , ticking time - bomb plaques .
So far , no biomarker has proved very accurate .
Mr. Russert ’s heart disease was a mixed picture .
Some factors looked favorable .
There was no family history of heart attacks .
Though he had high blood pressure , drugs lowered it pretty well , said his internist , Dr. Michael A. Newman .
His total cholesterol was not high , nor was his LDL , the bad type of cholesterol , or his C - reactive protein , a measure of inflammation that is thought to contribute to plaque rupture .
He did not smoke .
At his last physical , in April , he passed a stress test , and his heart function was good .
Dr. Newman estimated his risk of a heart attack in the next 10 years at 5 percent , based on a widely used calculator .
On the negative side , Mr. Russert had low HDL , the protective cholesterol , and high triglycerides .
He was quite overweight ; a waist more than 40 inches in men increases heart risk .
A CT scan of his coronary arteries in 1998 gave a calcium score of 210 , indicating artery disease  healthy arteries do not have calcium deposits  and a moderate to high risk of a heart attack .
An echocardiogram in April found that the main heart pumping chamber had thickened , his ability to exercise had decreased slightly , and his blood pressure had increased a bit .
Dr. Newman and his cardiologist , Dr. George Bren , changed his blood pressure medicines , and the pressure lowered to 120/80 , Dr. Newman said .
Another blood test , for a substance called apoB , might have been a better measure of risk than LDL , some doctors say .
Others disagree .
Some doctors say people like Mr. Russert , with no symptoms but risk factors like a thickened heart , should have angiograms , in which a catheter is threaded into the coronary arteries , dye is injected , and X - rays are taken to look for blockages .
Some advocate less invasive CT angiograms .
Both types of angiogram can identify plaque deposits , and if extensive disease or blockages at critical points are found , a bypass is usually recommended .
But the tests still cannot tell if plaques are likely to rupture , Dr. Smith and other cardiologists say .
And Mr. Russert ’s doctors did not think that an angiogram was needed .
An autopsy found , in addition to the plaque rupture , extensive disease in Mr. Russert ’s coronary arteries , enough to surprise his doctors , they said .
Had they found it before , Dr Newman said , a bypass would have been recommended .
Dr. Bren differed , saying many cardiologists would still not have advised surgery .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. authorities arrested on Thursday the girlfriend of fugitive former hedge fund manager Samuel Israel III , accusing her of helping to stage his suicide on the day he was to report to prison for fraud .
Missing hedge fund manager Samuel Israel is seen in this picture released by the U.S. Marshals office .

Debra Ryan confessed on Thursday to federal authorities that she helped Israel pack a recreational vehicle with his belongings and park it at a rest stop near a highway in New York on June 9 , the day he went missing .
The details are contained in a three - page complaint , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York , that said Ryan “ unlawfully , willfully and knowingly aided and abetted ” Israel ’s failure to show up for prison .
Israel , who engineered the $ 2 trillion hedge fund industry ’s most brazen and long - running fraud , sparked a federal investigation after his GMC Envoy was found on a bridge above the Hudson River on June 9 , its engine idling and the words “ suicide is painless ” etched in dust on its hood .
Authorities last week ruled out suicide and have issued a “ wanted ” posted for the balding 48 - year - old co-founder of the Bayou Group , a Connecticut - based hedge fund .
He pleaded guilty in 2005 and was sentenced in April for his role in a scheme to fabricate returns and cheat investors out of $ 450 million .
Authorities interviewed Ryan on “ numerous occasions ” since Israel disappeared , the complaint said .
On the day he went missing , she told police he had left home at 9:30 a.m. , saying he was driving himself to prison to begin serving his 20 - year sentence .
His SUV was discovered about three hours later on New York ’s Bear Mountain Bridge .
The next day , she told police that Israel had left a suicide note , and handed it over , the complaint said .
The complaint offers a glimpse into Israel ’s possible escape plans .
Two days before he disappeared , he met Ryan at an auto repair shop near Bedford , a town about 47 miles north of New York City and about 20 miles southeast of Bear Mountain Bridge , according to the complaint , which was signed by Deputy U.S. Marshal Sean McCluskey .
At the shop , she helped him attach a motor scooter to a hydraulic lift on the back of his recreation vehicle .
The next day , she helped him pack it , according to her confession .
Early in the morning on the day he was to report to prison in Ayer , Massachusetts , Israel woke her up and asked for help again .
As he drove the RV to a rest area near the intersection of Interstate highways 84 and 684 , she followed in her own car .
She then drove him to their home , the complaint said .
McCluskey said that complaint deliberately excluded some facts in the investigation because it was issued for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause .
For example , there was no mention of surveillance video from the bridge that authorities have said shows a second car pulling past Israel ’s SUV and stopping .
JHK Turns up on This American Life Spinoff About S - Town ( aka Woodstock ) Alabama
Released : May 31 , 2017
In this bonus episode , James Howard Kunstler reunites with former KunstlerCast host / producer Duncan Crary for a behind - the - scenes discussion of JHK ’s personal connection to the wildly popular S - Town podcast , a This American Life spinoff program .
Back around 2010 - 2013 , John B. McLemore , the tragic figure at the center of the series began an email correspondence with JHK .
John B was a real person , referred to by various people in the series as “ brilliant , ” “ a genius , ” “ a real character , ” and he was for sure .
He was also a fan of Jim ’s books , and , after getting his phone number off his website , took to calling him on the phone .
The two probably had a dozen long phone conversations .
It is well - known now that he called his home of Woodstock , Alabama , “ Shit - town . ”
He regaled JHK with many a sordid tale of the home - folk , and even of himself .
To Jim , the place sounded like “ Hieronymus Bosch meets Dogpatch . ”
Since John
B seemed so unhappy under his mask of hilarity and mirth , Jim tried to encourage him to think about moving .
He always had an excuse for not doing that , but clearly John B and the neighbors he disdained , fought with , looked for love with , had a synergistic thing going .
They needed each other to play out their never - ending crazy scripts of cracker mischief , vengeance , and failure .
After a while , John B went dark .
Jim thought JB had just gotten tired of advising him to move .
As it turns out , what happened to John would become the subject of an audio documentary that has broken all the records in podcasting and stirred up a bit of controversy .
Because so many of the concepts McLemore espouses in the series are inspired by JHK ’s blogs and writings ( sometimes John uses Jim ’s exact phraseology ) , Duncan suggests the early KunstlerCast years are a bit like a “ prequel ” to S - Town .

I 'm oddly sleepy tonight , so rather than go into anything thoughtful or at length , let me get something off of my chest that 's been bugging me all week .
Last Sunday , I was at a party at a friend 's house , and one of the guests got literally falling - down drunk .
So be it ; not everybody does as good a job of holding their liquor , and some people actually like ( and some hosts actually tolerate ) getting so sloppy drunk they can't even walk .
No big deal .
No big deal , that is , until along about 10 or 11 pm , the drunk decided it would be a crisis of biblical proportions if he did n't get home to feed his dogs before morning , so he had to drive home , right now .
We stopped him by talking him out of it .
Then we had to stop him from making a break for the door ; it took four of us to get him away from the door , sitting down , and agreeing to wait for the cab we called for him .
But because of last weekend 's storms ( which are what 's reminding me , we 're having a lovely one now , too ) , the cabs were running too slow for him ... so he made another break for his car .
It took three of us to stop him , but it was made easier by the fact that he was so falling - down drunk that he went arse - over - teakettle trying to navigate his way down a half a flight of porch steps , even while clinging desperately to the railing .
We got him away from his car , assured him the cab would be here any minute now ... and he waited until we were distracted by the storm , and made another break for it , almost making it into his car before the biggest of us tackled him .
It took physical force and threats of a 911 call to distract him long enough for the host to actually pick his pocket andhis keys .
Which he responded to , over the next several minutes , with plaintive pleas for his keys , and with two attempts to take his keys back from the host via deception in one case , then force .
I 'm religiously contemptuous of people who getdrunk .
But that 's not the part that 's been gnawing at me all week .
The part that 's been gnawing at me all week is this :
He could n't walk two steps on flat level flooring without holding onto something .
He could n't navigate three stair - steps while holding onto the railing without falling down .
And he could n't speak a sentence longer than four words without losing his train of thought and trailing off into awkward silence for long , long seconds at a time .
But he was still convinced , or at least thought it was plausible to convince us , that he was sober and safe to drive .
And you know what ?
I can almost , not really but almost , excuse that in someone the very first time they get drunk , if they 've never been confronted with external evidence of how impaired they are when they 're in that condition .
But this guy 's as old as I am , and been drinking even longer , and he still has n't learned better ?
Inexcusable .
But you know what ?
I 've been around a lot of intoxicated people in my almost 48 years of life , intoxicated on just about everything ever invented to get off on except ( oddly enough ) cocaine , heroin , or PCP .
I 've been around people who were trashed out of their mind on drugs you 've maybe never even heard of .
And I 'm told that what I 'm about to say may not actually be true about cocaine , so I 'll accept that caveat , that possible exception to what I 'm about to say , which is this : with only that one possible exception , I have noticed this huge and glaring difference between drunks and between stoners , and it's that only the drunks do n't think that they 're intoxicated .
Drunks insist that they 're completely fine , and then go on to demonstrate their confidence that they 're completely fine by attempting physical feats that are flatly impossible for them in their current condition .
The results range from minor property damage up to and including mass murder by driving their cars at 100 mi/hr and up head on into busloads of orphans , all of them insisting the whole way to anyone who tries to stop them , " leave me alone , I 'm fine . "
Stoners , on the other hand , without exception I have ever seen , not only know that they 're screwed up , not only tend to sit almost completely still because they know they 're too screwed - up to function , on top of that ?
How screwed up they are isor at least topic # 1 of any conversation , the one they keep coming back to .
And even after studying the culture and physiology and history and theology of alcohol at substantial length ?
( And not for the first time , let me recommend an extraordinarily good book on the subject , Stephen Braun , ) I am still baffled as to why this is .
But I have long past had it up to here with it .

DHS transition planning goes ' deeper than normal '
RAW STORY
Published : Thursday April 17 , 2008

The only cabinet - level agency created since Sept. 11 wants to make sure it does n't get caught flat - footed when a new president takes office next January , so it already has begun transition planning .
The Department of Homeland Security , which President Bush established after the terror attacks , is going through the same process that all of the federal government does every four or eight years , but observers say the prevalence of terror attacks on or around election times has DHS especially on edge .
" In every transition , departments and agencies are decapitated .
All the political appointees disappear , " said Bill Galston , a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution .
But the DHS planning effort " sounds more thorough and deeper than the norm , " said Galston , who worked in the Clinton White House as a domestic policy adviser .
" There 's no question about the fact that in certain sectors of the government , 9/11 was a game - changer and now that the game has changed , they'd be irresponsible not to think about incident planning and how government should respond , " he said .
The Sept. 11 attacks , and subsequent terrorist strikes in Spain , Britain and Pakistan near elections or transitions , indeed led DHS to make special efforts as it looks ahead to the twilight - zone period between the inauguration and the confirmations , Chertoff said .
The 1993 World Trade Center bombing occurred the month after President Bill Clinton took office .
From a 12th - floor desk at the regional Federal Emergency Management Agency office , Nancy Ward can survey a swath of her FEMA territory where millions of people , from downtown Oakland to San Francisco and beyond , live and work atop earthquake faults .
Soon Ward 's portfolio , including several Western states , will expand to include the nation 's complete complement of catastrophe zones , from Southeastern hurricanes to Southwestern wildfires to Midwestern tornadoes and floods .
Ward is part of a cadre of senior career officials who have been tapped to temporarily take the reins of disaster - and security - related government posts on Inauguration Day .
She will become interim FEMA administrator on Jan. 20 , 2009 , alongside dozens of others who will run key agencies until the next president picks top leaders and the Senate confirms them .
" We can't call a timeout for six months , because the world is n't going to call a timeout , " Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said in a recent interview in San Francisco with The Associated Press .
Presidential transition planning has been going on since George Washington was getting ready to hand off to John Adams , and it's now routine for military and intelligence planners .
The president 's top appointees usually leave with him , and the government runs itself until the new occupant of the White House settles in .
There are rare but notable exceptions : Clinton White House anti-terrorism chief Richard A. Clarke and CIA Director George Tenet were kept on board by the Bush White House and helped lead the government 's response on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Chertoff was one of just a handful of Justice Department appointees who had been confirmed on Sept.
11 ; FBI Director Robert Mueller was not even nominated by President Bush until July 2001 and did not take the oath of office until a week before the attacks .
" We faced 9/11 with many of the positions not populated .
That 's not a responsible way to deal with the threats we have now , " Chertoff said .
" We want to get career people in these positions fully up to speed , we want to reduce a lot of what we 've done to written doctrine , we want to get as much of our planning finished as we can this year , " he said .
It is an unfamiliar exercise for an agency that was born after the terrorist attacks : DHS has never undergone a transition from one administration to another , though most of its component agencies , like the Secret Service , have .
DHS also oversees the Transportation Security Administration , Customs and Border Protection , Immigration and Customs Enforcement and several other agencies .
The department is working to line up career officials for about 50 key roles , Chertoff said .
It began transition planning last year , asking state and local governments as well as the private sector for its " best practices " in transition situations .
Next month , it is convening a three - day conference where about 200 senior career officials , including some of the interim leaders , will conduct an exercise in response to a hypothetical , national - level incident , said DHS spokeswoman Amy Kudwa .
There has been no official communication on this with the three senators vying to be the next president  Barack Obama , Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain .
But Obama is a member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , and DHS has briefed the panel on its transition activities , Kudwa said .
Ward is now juggling her responsibilities as the head of FEMA Region 9 , which includes California , Nevada , Arizona , Hawaii and Guam , with the demands of transition planning .
Before a recent interview in her office , she spent 90 minutes on a transition - planning conference call with Washington officials .
" It 's a bit overwhelming , I have to admit , " said Ward , 53 , who has spent her entire career in government , including nearly 27 years working for the State of California , most of it in disaster planning .
But , she said , " It 's in your blood , and when you 're asked , it 's hard to say ' no . ' "
Despite her experience , or perhaps because of it , Ward confesses that she is squeamish about riding the trains beneath the San Francisco Bay between Oakland and San Francisco .
" I 'm claustrophobic , I 'm a little nervous about being under the water if a big one should hit , " she said .
Nor would she drive on the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge for six years after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake , when part of the bridge collapsed .
Ward says she has received no guidance about how long she should expect to stay at the helm of FEMA but has committed to stay " as long as it takes . "
She emphasizes she is not eager for the current FEMA administrator , R. David Paulison , to step aside , adding with a laugh :
" I 'm probably the one person that wants him to stay absolutely to the very , very end , and past if that 's an option . "
With wire reports
One of the most closely - watched file - sharing cases is a step closer to an end .
A federal judge has awarded exonerated RIAA defendant Tanya Andersen $ 107,834 in attorneys ' fees , a figure that is n't exactly what either party wanted .
Andersen , a single mother in Oregon , was accused by the RIAA in 2005 of sharing music over KaZaA .
Andersen denied the charges , filed a countersuit , and the RIAA finally dismissed the lawsuit last summer .
Once the RIAA dismissed the case , she sought and won an attorneys ' fees award as the prevailing party .
In a five - page opinion ( PDF , found via Recording Industry vs The People ) , Judge James A. Redden agreed with a magistrate judge 's calculations , rejecting both Andersen 's argument for a significantly higher fee award and the RIAA 's appeal for a much lower legal bill .
Andersen 's attorney , Lory Lybeck , had sought nearly $ 300,000 — about $ 150,000 in fees and a multiplier of double the fee due to his " high - risk " and " successful " defense .
The RIAA countered that the $ 298,995 fee sought was " excessive " and that it should instead be in the neighborhood of one - tenth of that number .
The labels said it was nothing more than a " straightforward " copyright infringement case , and that its independent experts thought the fees sought were excessive in many respects .
In particular , the RIAA focused on the fact that Andersen occasionally had more than one attorney present at hearings , arguing that one attorney was sufficient .
The problem with that reasoning is that the RIAA found it necessary to have as many as six attorneys present at a single hearing .
Judge Redden dismissed the arguments of both sides , finding the labels ' objections to be " without merit . "
Similarly , he agreed with the magistrate judge 's finding that no fee multiplier was warranted in Atlantic v. Andersen .
With the matter of attorneys ' fees presumably settled ( it 's possible that the RIAA and / or Andersen might appeal — and the RIAA 's record shows that it is willing to fight tooth - and - nail against fee awards ) , both parties can focus entirely on Andersen 's malicious prosecution lawsuit .
In it , Andersen accuses the RIAA of a whole host of misdeeds , including fraud , conspiracy , and abuse of the legal process .
That case is moving ahead , with the parties submitting a joint status report and discovery plan earlier this month .
Zillow , the real estate informational site , is facing some trouble in Arizona .
The state of Arizona has issued a cease and desist to Zillow , citing that Zillow needs to be a certified appraiser in order to offer up the information the site is known for .
Zillow gets their information from public documents and offers property estimates accordingly .
Many in the real estate industry , including Realtors and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition , have disliked Zillow from the start , insisting that the estimates provided is often incorrect .
Zillow obviously throws a wrench in many Realtor 's plans , as they grant access to information that the average home buyer or seller would not look up for themselves .
Relying on the experts is how many Realtors thrive , so tools that aim to level the disparity of knowledge are seen as bad ; in this case , illegal .
Zillow has been growing since its onset , and they 've recently added some social networking components to help users further understand the market from first hand accounts of other users .
Others looking to make neighborhood knowledge more accessible to the public are YourStreet and StreetAdvisor .

War camp kids chant ' Ooh , aah , ooh , aah , I want to kill somebody . '
Reuters
Published : Saturday June 28 , 2008

Print This Email This WEST POINT , New York ( Reuters ) - Climbing ropes and crawling in the mud under barbed wire , dozens of American high school kids at an unusual summer camp vied to see who could get most dirty as they tackled an Army obstacle course .
And as they ran between obstacles in the woods , the kids shouted Army chants .
Asked by a cadet if they were motivated , they shouted back in unison : " Motivated , motivated , downright motivated .
Ooh , aah , ooh , aah , I want to kill somebody . "
Each summer , 800 high school kids hoping to become soldiers spend a week at West Point to see what life is like at the prestigious U.S. military academy for future army officers .
With the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan straining the U.S. military and public support low for the Iraq war , recruiting future officers might seem a tough sell .
But officials say applications to the summer program are at a record high .
West Point says it recruits " scholars , leaders and athletes . "
Kids at the Summer Leadership Seminar , a week - long residential program held over two sessions , have top grades and are strong in sports and extra-curricular activities .
Alex Imbriale , a 17 - year - old from North Carolina who is captain of his school 's rifle team , attributed his interest in West Point to his father , who is in the army .
But there were plenty of students on the program who are not " army brats . "
Kathleen Engle , 16 , from Fairfield , California , said she had looked into the Peace Corps and other options but decided on the military .
" I was in fifth grade when 9/11 happened and that 's when I decided the best thing I could do for my country was this , " she said , playing a video game called " America 's Army . "
" I guess it 's going to be hard to kill someone , but if that 's your job and that 's what our commander tells us we need to do , I 'm going to do that in order to protect my country . "
IMMIGRANTS AND ADVENTURERS
Mario Vazquez , 17 , from El Paso , Texas , hopes to be a neurosurgeon but first he says he has a duty to America .
" My Mom is actually the one that found out about it , " he said of the West Point summer program .
" My mother is from Mexico ... she said it 's a good place to get discipline . "
" I owe a lot to this country because of what it 's given me , because of what it 's given my family , but I also have fears because it 's a lot of sacrifice , " he said .
" You put your country before yourself and you sacrifice your family and a lot of other privileges . "
Austin Fullmer , 17 , from Las Cruces , New Mexico , said he was attracted by the prospect of moving around the world and seeing new places , and although he would be nervous about deploying to a combat zone , " it 's just another adventure . "
" I did n't quite realize there were this many kids like me , " he said , grinning as he sat in the doorway of Blackhawk helicopter parked in a field .
Graduates of the academy founded in 1802 include former President Dwight Eisenhower , Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf , who led U.S. forces in the first Gulf War , and astronaut Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin .
During their week at the picturesque campus on the banks of the Hudson river in New York state , the high - school students are immersed in cadet life .
They are woken at 5 a.m for physical training , they march in formation under the command of current cadets , take academic workshops and spend a day in the field .
" We 're able to pick the most competitive students , " said Lt. Col .
Dean Batchelder , who handles admissions .
There were 3,674 applications for 800 places on the high - school program .
Those who attend are not guaranteed admission to the academy -- which offers a four - year college education in return for a commitment of five years active duty and three years as a reservist -- but they stand a good chance , he said .
" I 'm not here to screen them , " Batchelder added .
" We 're not trying to weed out the weak , we 're trying to give them the information so they can make a better choice . "
NATION AT WAR
Her jeans and pink shirt caked in mud , her face daubed with camouflage cream , 17 - year - old Elise Fink put on a flak jacket , stuffed her blonde ponytail under a helmet , and climbed up into the gun turret of a Humvee to check out the machine gun .
" In Iraq you 'll be carrying about 40 pounds more than that , " Specialist Justin Fletcher , a 10th Mountain Division soldier who returned from Iraq late last year , told her .
The grand - daughter of two brigadier generals and daughter of a lieutenant colonel , Fink says her family was supportive of her interest in West Point or the Reserve Officers ' Training Corps ( ROTC ) .
Her friends in Wilton , Connecticut , less so .
" My town does n't do military , " Fink said .
" My town is very anti-war right now , so to join the military means you 're pro-war , and a lot of my friends are anti-war . "
" When I said that I was planning on doing ROTC or coming to West Point , they said ' I do n't want you to get killed . ' "
Fink says support or disapproval of the war in Iraq is irrelevant to her military ambitions .
" I feel it 's my duty , and it 's people 's duty to serve their country in some way , " she said .
" This is the way I chose . "
Lt. Col. Jeffrey Wilson , who runs the summer academic program , said applications for the Summer Leadership Seminar were at a record high this year .
" I 'm not sure how the fact that we 're a nation at war has influenced the motivation of any particular student to apply , " he said .
" I think that there is a strong sense of service in this generation . "
YELLING AND HAZING
Life as a cadet at West Point is highly regimented , with every detail from how to fold your underwear to the position of personal items on your desk dictated by regulations .
Jordy Kronshag , a 17 - year - old from Callumet , Michigan , whose skill at the pole vault made her the equal of much larger males on the obstacle course , said she enjoyed the teamwork and leadership training but was still unsure about applying to become a cadet .
" This is the fun part , " she said , her clothes muddy from the low crawl under barbed wire .
" But also a part I do n't like is all the yelling and the hazing , that 's going to be tough . "
On a day set aside for academic workshops , students in one group staged a mock murder trial .
Others built a light - seeking robot in an electrical engineering class .
A third group played " Double Philosophy Jeopardy , " with pop culture categories showing how characters in " Star Wars " or " The Simpsons " illustrate stoicism or the philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche .
At a panel discussion with 10 current cadets one evening , the students asked about free time , punishments for alcohol use , how much cadets work out , whether they have online courses , how cold winters are and how much sleep cadets get .
Cadet John Williams said he applied to West Point for the wrong reasons and did n't know much about it in advance .
" I know a lot of you are doing it for the wrong reasons , " he told the students .
" You want people to be proud of you , it 's pretty prestigious , you do n't want to let people down , " he said .
" That might not be a bad thing . "
" I came for the wrong reasons , I 've definitely stayed for the right reasons . "
Editor 's Note : After much deliberation , food writer John " Mr. Bad Food " McGran has come up with the " best " of the worst foods he ’s reviewed over the past year .
Here there are in his words ( in no particular order ) — the worst foods of the year !
1. Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Six Dollar Burger
I ’m an East Coast kind of guy , but I realize there are no boundaries when it comes to bad foods .
So , for this review , I took the advice of 19th Century newspaper editor Horace Greeley who urged , “ Go west , young man , go west . ”
The Western Bacon Six Dollar Burger will gun you down with 1,130 calories ( 600 from fat ) , 66g fat ( 100 % of your Daily Reference Value ) , 28g saturated fat ( 140 % DRV ) , 150 mg cholesterol , 2,540 mg sodium ( 110 %DRV ) , 83g carbs , and 47g protein .
I ’m beginning to understand why it ’s called the Wild West !
Sorry boys , but I ’ll take the 3:10 to Yuma … and then the next plane to good old Philly , land of cheese steaks and soft pretzels over this one !
2. Pizza Hut Double Deep Pizza
These Double Deep Pizzas are handcrafted by loading an entire pizza with twice the toppings of a medium pizza , plus 50 % more cheese and then wrapping the crust over the top to hold all the toppings in .
I tried two slices of the Meaty variety .
According to the
In all fairness , the suggest serving is one slice ( 1/8 the medium pie ) but who eats a single slice ?
Not me .
3. El Monterey XX Large Chimichanga
While shopping at Wal - Mart here in Northeastern Pennsylvania , I noticed Spicy Red Hot Beef & Bean Chimichangas in a cooler near the deli .
They looked suspiciously like my 3 - for - a - buck burritos of yesteryear — only bigger and a tad more costly .
While a standard burrito wraps a filling of meat , beans and / or cheese in a flour tortilla , a chimichanga is a meat - filled tortilla … deep - fried .
The key words " deep - fried " may explain why my mushy 10 - ounce XX Large Chimichanga did a Mexican fat dance on my diet to the tune of 920 calories , 57g of fat ( 15g saturated , 1g trans fat ) , 40 mg cholesterol , 1,140 mg sodium , 83g carbs , and 22g protein .
Ay , caramba !
It 's a good thing I only had one .
4. Denny ’s Meat Lover ’s Scramble As Mr. Bad Food , I ’ve seen plenty of bad nutrition numbers in my day .
But I never saw anything as heart - stopping as what I found on the
It was my stomach that turned upside down when I checked out the nutrition numbers for Denny ’s Meat Lover ’s Scramble .
Denny ’s could be charged with “ salt with a deadly weapon ” for serving a breakfast entree that packs an unbelievable 4,170 mg of sodium !
( The Recommended Daily Allowance for sodium is 2,400mg . )
The Meat Lover ’s Scramble will also shake you down with 1,280 calories , 71g of fat ( 21 saturated , 0 trans ) , 565 mg cholesterol ( the RDA is 300 mg ) , 103g carbs and 54g protein ( RDA is 50 ) .
By the way , the RDA for fat is 65 grams , so you are taking in more than a day ’s fat , cholesterol and sodium in a single meal !
So if you find yourself at a Denny ’s and someone recommends a scramble , take my advice and scramble for the door !
5. Hardee ’s Country Breakfast Burrito
The word burrito sounds like a term for a little burro .
If you do n’t want to make an ass of yourself — by scarfing down 60 grams of fat with your first meal of the day — then steer clear of the Country Breakfast Burrito at Hardee’s .
The king - sized breakfast burrito is cobbled together from two omelets , five hashrounds ( their cutesy version of hashbrowns ) , cheddar cheese , and sausage gravy .
The omelets that fill out the tortilla each contain two eggs , crumbled sausage , diced ham and bacon bits .
Now , if you ’re hungry for 920 calories , 23 grams of saturated fat , and nearly 2,000 milligrams of sodium for your morning meal , dig in !
6. KFC Chicken & Biscuit Bowl
The clever cooks at KFC devised a way to toss together an entire chicken dinner in a single bowl .
According to the
A blend …a jumble …a clutter …Call it what you will .
But after checking out the nutrition facts , I call the Chicken & Biscuit bowl a great way to flock up your diet !
Their nutrition guide says that the Chicken & Biscuit dish will bowl you over with 870 calories , 44g of fat ( 11 saturated , 4.5 trans ) , 60 mg cholesterol , 2,420 mg sodium ( 101 % of your recommended daily amount ) , 88g carbs , and 29g protein .
7. Starbucks Double Chocolate Chip Frappuccino Blended Crème
When is a coffee drink not a coffee drink ?
When it comes with calories and frothy extras you ’d expect to get with a milkshake !
Oh , and when it does n’t even include coffee !
Case in point :
The 24 - ounce ( that ’s Venti- sized in Starbucks lingo ) Double Chocolate Chip Frappuccino Blended Crème served up at your local Starbucks .
This drink is made from rich chocolate , chocolate chips and milk , and is blended with ice , and topped with whipped cream ( optional ) , and chocolate drizzle .
With 670 calories , 22g of total fat , ( 12g saturated fat ; 0.5g of trans fat ) , and 107g of carbs , it only sounds like a coffee drink .
The 12 grams of saturated fat is equal to the saturated fat you get in a McDonald ’s Quarter - Pounder with Cheese … but the sandwich packs 160 fewer calories than the Frappuccino !
8. Pizza Hut P’Zone
It takes two hands to handle a Pizza Hut P’Zone .
The problem is — according to the nutrition info on their website — it should also take two people !
Yes , despite the fact their TV ads showed a bunch of hungry guys chowing down on whole P’Zones , each super - sized dough pockets of meats , cheeses and sauce is considered TWO SERVINGS .
The nutrition numbers … doubled for those of us who consider the P’Zones one - meal wonders :
P'Zone Classic : 1,220 calories , 46g fat , 22g saturated fat , 2g trans fat , 130 mg cholesterol , 2,700 mg sodium , 144g carbs , 8g fiber , 60g protein .
P'Zone Pepperoni : 1,260 calories , 48g fat , 22g saturated fat , 2g trans fat , 140 mg cholesterol , 2,980 mg sodium , 140g carbs , 6g fiber , 64g protein .
P'Zone Meaty : 1,380 calories , 58g fat , 26g saturated fat , 2g trans fat , 160 mg cholesterol , 3,460 mg sodium , 144g carbs , 8g fiber , 70g protein .
9. Wendy ’s Baconator
The term “ Baconator ” sparks images of an action flick featuring a leading man with a terribly thick Austrian accent .
But if you ’re planning on ordering Wendy ’s newest blockbuster , think again .
I can picture it now : A seatbelt - straining drive - thru customer grabs his grease - stained bag of beef , bacon and fried potatoes , and before driving off to feast upon his Baconator , he shouts to the drive - up window jockey , “ I ’ll be bawk … for my defibrillator paddles ! ”
Then , just before he zooms out of earshot , the server leans out of her window and yells back at him : “ Hasta la vista , flabby ! ”
OK , so it ’s poor scriptwriting .
But it ’s also poor dining to indulge in this Wendy ’s double cheeseburger on steroids .
The Baconator boasts two beef patties , two slices of cheese and SIX slices of bacon !
Do yourself a favor and terminate your urge to order this beast of a burger .
The nutritional numbers for the 10 - ounce Baconator : 830 calories , 51g of fat ( 22g saturated , 2.5g trans fat ) , 170mg of cholesterol , 1,920 mg of sodium , 35g of carbs , and 57g of protein .
10 . Denny ’s Extreme Grand Slam Ads for Denny ’s Grand Slam breakfasts used to feature the tagline , “ $ 2.99 … Are you out of your mind ? ! ”
Now that the restaurant chain has launched ads for its new Extreme Grand Slam — a breakfast platter piled high with three strips of bacon , three sausage links , two eggs , hash browns and three pancakes — they might want to change it to , “ You ’re ordering a Denny ’s Extreme Grand Slam … Are you out of your freakin’ mind ? ! ”
The
The nutritional numbers for the 21 - ounce Extreme Grand Slam : 1,160 calories , 64g of fat ( 17g of saturated fat ) , 560 mg of cholesterol , 3,750 mg of sodium , 102g of carbs , 4g of fiber , and 45g of protein .
There you have it — my picks for 2007 ’s Best of the Worst … or should I say , The Worst of the Worst !
Have a Happy and Healthy 2008 !

what ?
did they think that they would end up on the internet or something ?
at least they left you something to remember them by …

( Newser ) – European countries facing record prices for oil and natural gas are turning to coal to fuel their energy needs , deeply worrying environmentalists , the New York Times reports .
During the next five years , about 50 new coal - fired power plants will open across Europe .
Many electricity companies say they have no other choice .
In Italy , where fuel costs have jumped 151 % since 1996 , a spokesman for a major electricity producer insists its new plant “ will be the cleanest coal plant in Europe . ”
But the technology that reduces local pollution does n’t reduce carbon emissions .
Rather than opening new plants , “ we need a moratorium on coal now , with a phase - out of existing plants over the next two decades , " said a leading climatologist .
( Read more climate change stories . )
How do mercury emissions affect pregnant mothers , the unborn and toddlers ?
Do the level of emissions impact autism rates ?
Does it matter whether a mercury - emitting source is 10 miles away from families versus 20 miles ?
Is the risk of autism greater for children who live closer to the pollution source ?
A newly published study of Texas school district data and industrial mercury - release data , conducted by researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio , indeed shows a statistically significant link between pounds of industrial release of mercury and increased autism rates .
It also shows — for the first time in scientific literature — a statistically significant association between autism risk and distance from the mercury source .
“ This is not a definitive study , but just one more that furthers the association between environmental mercury and autism , ” said lead author Raymond F. Palmer , Ph.D. , associate professor of family and community medicine at the UT Health Science Center San Antonio .
The article is in the journal Health & Place .
Dr. Palmer , Stephen Blanchard , Ph.D. , of Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio and Robert Wood of the UT Health Science Center found that community autism prevalence is reduced by 1 percent to 2 percent with each 10 miles of distance from the pollution source .
“ This study was not designed to understand which individuals in the population are at risk due to mercury exposure , ” Dr. Palmer said .
“ However , it does suggest generally that there is greater autism risk closer to the polluting source . ”
The study should encourage further investigations designed to determine the multiple routes of mercury exposure .
“ The effects of persistent , low - dose exposure to mercury pollution , in addition to fish consumption , deserve attention , ” Dr. Palmer said .
“ Ultimately , we will want to know who in the general population is at greatest risk based on genetic susceptibilities such as subtle deficits in the ability to detoxify heavy metals . ”
The new study findings are consistent with a host of other studies that confirm higher amounts of mercury in plants , animals and humans the closer they are to the pollution source .
The price on children may be the highest .

“ We suspect low - dose exposures to various environmental toxicants , including mercury , that occur during critical windows of neural development among genetically susceptible children may increase the risk for developmental disorders such as autism , ” the authors wrote .
Study highlights
Mercury - release data examined were from 39 coal - fired power plants and 56 industrial facilities in Texas .
Autism rates examined were from 1,040 Texas school districts .
For every 1,000 pounds of mercury released by all industrial sources in Texas into the environment in 1998 , there was a corresponding 2.6 percent increase in autism rates in the Texas school districts in 2002 .
For every 1,000 pounds of mercury released by Texas power plants in 1998 , there was a corresponding 3.7 percent increase in autism rates in Texas school districts in 2002 .
Autism prevalence diminished 1 percent to 2 percent for every 10 miles from the source .
Mercury exposure through fish consumption is well documented , but very little is known about exposure routes through air and ground water .
There is evidence that children and other developing organisms are more susceptible to neurobiological effects of mercury .
Implications
“ We need to be concerned about global mercury emissions since a substantial proportion of mercury releases are spread around the world by long - range air and ocean currents , ” Dr. Palmer said .
“ Steps for controlling and eliminating mercury pollution on a worldwide basis may be advantageous .
This entails greener , non-mercury - polluting technologies . ”
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) estimated environmental mercury releases at 158 million tons annually nationwide in the late 1990s , the time period studied by the Texas team .
Most exposures were said to come from coal - fired utility plants ( 33 percent of exposures ) , municipal / medical waste incinerators ( 29 percent ) and commercial / industrial boilers ( 18 percent ) .
Cement plants also release mercury .
advertisement
With the enactment of clean air legislation and other measures , mercury deposition into the environment is decreasing slightly .
Limitations
Dr. Palmer and his colleagues pointed out the study did not reflect the true community prevalence rates of autism because children younger than school age are not counted in the Texas Education Agency data system .
The 1:500 autism rates in the study are lower than the 1:150 autism rates in recent reports of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Furthermore , the authors note that distance was not calculated from individual homes to the pollution source but from central points in school districts that varied widely in area .
Data sources
Data for environmentally released mercury were from the United States Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory .
Data for releases by coal - fired power plants came from the same inventory and from the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality .
Data for school district autism came from the Texas Education Agency .

Temperatures spiked 22 degrees F in just 50 years , researchers say
Information gleaned from a Greenland ice core by an international science team shows that two huge Northern Hemisphere temperature spikes prior to the close of the last ice age some 11,500 years ago were tied to fundamental shifts in atmospheric circulation .
The ice core showed the Northern Hemisphere briefly emerged from the last ice age some 14,700 years ago with a 22 - degree - Fahrenheit spike in just 50 years , then plunged back into icy conditions before abruptly warming again about 11,700 years ago .
Startlingly , the Greenland ice core evidence showed that a massive " reorganization " of atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere coincided with each temperature spurt , with each reorganization taking just one or two years , said the study authors .
The new findings are expected to help scientists improve existing computer models for predicting future climate change as increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere drive up Earth 's temperatures globally .
The team used changes in dust levels and stable water isotopes in the annual ice layers of the two - mile - long Greenland ice core , which was hauled from the massive ice sheet between 1998 to 2004 , to chart past temperature and precipitation swings .
Their paper was published in the June 19 issue of Science Express , the online version of Science .
The ice cores -- analyzed with powerful microscopes -- were drilled as part of the North Greenland Ice Core Project led by project leader Dorthe Dahl - Jensen of the Centre for Ice and Climate at the Neils Bohr Institute of the University of Copenhagen .
The study included 17 co-investigators from Europe , one from Japan and two from the United States -- Jim White and Trevor Popp from the University of Colorado at Boulder .
" We have analyzed the transition from the last glacial period until our present warm interglacial period , and the climate shifts are happening suddenly , as if someone had pushed a button , " said Dahl - Jenson .
According to the researchers , the first abrupt warming period beginning at 14,700 years ago lasted until about 12,900 years ago , when deep - freeze conditions returned for about 1,200 years before the onset of the second sharp warming event .
The two events indicate a speed in the natural climate change process never before seen in ice cores , said White , director of CU - Boulder 's Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research .
" We are beginning to tease apart the sequence of abrupt climate change , " said White , whose work was funded by the National Science Foundation 's Office of Polar Programs .
" Since such rapid climate change would challenge even the most modern societies to successfully adapt , knowing how these massive events start and evolve is one of the most pressing climate questions we need to answer . "
Both dramatic warming events were preceded by decreasing Greenland dust deposition , indicating higher tropical temperatures and significantly more rain falling on the deserts of Asia at the time , said White .
The team believes the ancient tropical warming caused large , rapid atmospheric changes at the equator , the intensification of the Pacific monsoon , sea-ice loss in the north Atlantic Ocean and more atmospheric heat and moisture over Greenland and much of the rest of the Northern Hemisphere .
" Here we propose a series of events beginning in the lower latitudes and leading to changes in the ocean and atmosphere that reveal for the first time the anatomy of abrupt climate change , " the authors wrote .
White likened the abrupt shift in the Northern Hemisphere circulation pattern to shifts in the North American jet stream as it steers storms around the continent .
" We know such events are in Earth 's future , but we do n't know when , " said White .
" One question is whether we can see the symptoms before big problems occur .
Until we answer these questions , we are speeding blindly down a narrow road , hoping there are no curves ahead . "
Each yearly record of ice can reveal past temperatures and precipitation levels , the content of ancient atmospheres and even evidence for the timing and magnitude of distant storms , fires and volcanic eruptions , said White .
The cores from the site -- located roughly in the middle of Greenland at an elevation of about 9,850 feet -- are four - inch - diameter cylinders brought to the surface in 11.5 - foot lengths , said White .

Former South African leader Nelson Mandela on Wednesday joined a growing chorus of African officials criticizing Zimbabwe ’s leadership , further shaking longtime President Robert Mugabe ’s grip on power .
Mugabe , who long shrugged off Western criticism and sanctions , has seen hitherto staunch allies in Africa , as well as China , turn away one by one in recent days , leaving him facing nearly complete international isolation .
He has vowed to proceed with Friday ’s presidential runoff election despite the pullout of his main opponent because of political violence that has left 85 opposition supporters dead and more than 3,000 injured .
Mugabe appeared determined to tough it out despite the foreign pressure , his lack of a majority in parliament and a collapsed economy , ruling party officials said .
Addressing a dinner in London , the iconic Mandela , who now rarely comments on politics , broke his silence to decry the “ tragic failure of leadership ” in Zimbabwe .

“ We look back at much human progress , but we sadly note so much failing as well , ” he said , mentioning conflicts in the Middle East , Iraq and Darfur to the high - powered audience that included former President Clinton , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and actor Robert DeNiro .
“ Nearer to home , ” Mandela continued , “ we had seen the outbreak of violence against fellow Africans in our own country and the tragic failure of leadership in our neighboring Zimbabwe . ”
Another South African Nobel laureate and apartheid struggle figure , the Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu , spoke out in stronger terms , telling Australian television that Mugabe had “ mutated into something quite unbelievable .
He has really turned into a kind of Frankenstein for his people . ”
Adding to the pressure on Zimbabwe , 300 opposition victims of political violence walked from a park in central Harare to the South African Embassy late Wednesday afternoon , where they sought asylum .
They were among 1,300 activists who had taken refuge in the opposition headquarters from rampaging groups of ruling party supporters across Zimbabwe .
They were left with nowhere to stay when the Movement for Democratic Change building was raided Monday .

Looking fearful as they walked , some carried their belongings in plastic sacks , some were limping , some had bandaged arms .
Among them were women .
As the horror of Zimbabwe ’s election violence has played out on television screens , Mugabe has seen his support deteriorate even among southern African leaders normally loath to criticize one another .
There have been calls for the election to be postponed from Kenya , Senegal , Botswana , Zambia and the security troika of the Southern African Development Community -- Tanzania , Swaziland and Angola .
South African President Thabo Mbeki has maintained his controversial “ quiet diplomacy , ” but Mbeki ’s spokesman said Wednesday that a high - level negotiator had been sent to try to mediate a settlement including the postponement of Friday ’s vote .
Zimbabwe ’s ruling party , ZANU - PF , has also been repudiated by the president of South Africa ’s ruling African National Congress , Jacob Zuma , in a blow to the view that it continues to share liberation - struggle credentials with Zuma ’s party .

Mugabe plans to have himself swiftly inaugurated for another five - year term after a vote Friday , according to ZANU - PF sources .
He also plans to quickly name his Cabinet .
The president would include some from outside ZANU - PF as ministers and label it a government of “ national unity , ” the sources said .
But opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai , who this week pulled out of the presidential vote because of the violence and Mugabe ’s unwillingness to cede power under any condition , will be excluded from the Cabinet , according to the sources .
“ We ’ll inaugurate him [ Mugabe ] , ” said a ZANU - PF official in an interview , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ He will proceed to appoint a Cabinet for a government of national unity , excluding Tsvangirai , and then life goes on , as if nothing happened . ”
Mugabe still lacks the parliamentary majority required to govern effectively , but ZANU - PF officials are confident they can entice opposition parliament members to join a unity government .

Tsvangirai announced that he would not negotiate with Mugabe if the ruling party pressed ahead with the election after weeks of violence .
“ The issue is that we will not have anything to do with a post - [ June ] 27 government arising out of this so - called election .
We have said we are prepared to negotiate on this side of the 27th , not the other side of the 27th , ” Tsvangirai said at a news conference at his home in Harare , the capital .
He later returned to the Dutch Embassy , where he sought refuge this week because of security concerns .
The regime has made it plain that it plans to proceed with the vote , with a banner headline in the state - owned Herald on Wednesday stating , “ Tsvangirai ca n’t pull out . ”
Zimbabwe Election Commission Chairman George Chiweshe rejected Tsvangirai ’s withdrawal from the election , saying it was too late .
“ Any withdrawal verbal or written is a nullity , ” he said .

Mugabe has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980 , but Tsvangirai ’s Movement for Democratic Change came close to ousting ZANU - PF in the March 29 elections , forcing the ruling party to minority status in parliament for the first time .
Tsvangirai won more votes than Mugabe -- about 48 % compared with about 43 % -- but not enough to avoid a runoff , according to official figures .
He says he won outright , with more than 50 % .
Mugabe , once seen as a liberation hero throughout Africa , has launched successive violent operations against his people when faced with a political threat , including the Matabeleland massacres in which thousands were killed in the 1980s , and land takeovers after 2000 that saw commercial white farmers and tens of thousands of their farmworkers evicted .
In 2005 , about 700,000 people in opposition strongholds had their homes destroyed .
Mugabe , 84 , has also presided over Zimbabwe ’s economic collapse , with poverty and hunger afflicting a nation once seen as southern Africa ’s breadbasket .
Mugabe blames “ illegal ” Western sanctions for his country ’s ills , although the measures are aimed at the travel and finances of top regime officials .

Tsvangirai accused Mugabe of declaring war on his country and called on the African Union and United Nations to oversee a transition process including peacekeepers .
A senior ZANU - PF figure acknowledged in a phone interview with The Times that party leaders were worried about the growing pressure from groups including the African Union and the Southern African Development Community .
At the same time , he said , African leaders should be concerned about the future impact .
“ If there ’s a move by African countries , the AU or SADC and the U.N. to try and force the removal of ZANU - PF from power and impose Tsvangirai , that will be a fatal move , ” he said .
“ Yes , Zimbabwe is a small country militarily and economically , but it will have serious repercussions in Africa .
“ If the AU and SADC are not careful in their own backyards , Africa is gone , ” continued the official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ Most of the African countries would have to suffer defeat and say , ‘ Let Europe take control of the whole of Africa . ’
In other words , in 20 or 30 years ’ time , the whole of Africa will be Europeanized . ”

Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said Zimbabwe was a “ disaster in the making ” that could turn into a Rwanda , a reference to the 1994 genocide .
The government of Ghana also expressed concern about the deteriorating political situation and called on Mugabe to find a peaceful solution and stop the “ violence and mayhem . ”
Britain , Zimbabwe ’s former colonial ruler , had its own way of slapping Mugabe ’s wrist : Queen Elizabeth II moved to strip Mugabe of his honorary knighthood , a highly unusual move not taken since 1989 , when former Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu had his honorary title taken away during the Balkan nation ’s revolution .
In addition , the England and Wales Cricket Board canceled a tour to England by Zimbabwe ’s team planned for next year .
The British government announced plans to widen travel and financial sanctions already aimed at 160 ZANU - PF government figures .
The plan is to include their family members on the list of sanctioned individuals .

Times staff writer Kim Murphy in London and a special correspondent in Harare contributed to this report .
We — and not just those of us attending this wonderful conference — understand that the American imperial experiment is ending .
The results were not as the experimenters envisioned .
Yet the results have been very much as the anti-federalists foresaw , as the so - called Old Right witnessed against , and as many in this room , and by extension , their extensive networks of free market ideology and small - L libertarianism implicitly understand .
The American Empire is over .
Our fiat money is increasingly valueless and garners a generalized disgust around the world .
Our economic engine was once driven by a purer form of capitalism and by people who could think and compete , and aspired to do so .
Today , we find an American version of national socialism , where the subsidized and intensely regulated planes and trains do n’t really run on time , but we are sublimely grateful for the government ’s assistance and leadership just the same .
We find today in America a massive government bureaucracy , at multiple levels , each layer lapping and snarling hungrily for its sustenance , and its justification .
We may think of regulators , inspectors , tax collectors , police forces , and city managers .
Curiously , in many rural counties across this country the largest employer is in fact the school system , binding a plurality of workers and parents to a national education system that strives to leave no child unscarred by standardization .
Whether this goal is accomplished by prescription medication , the slow torture of boredom , the ritualized sacrifice at the altar of the multiple choice state exam , or simply by the grinding , relentless institutional punishment of youthful curiosity and individuality , the goal is indeed accomplished .
Our military is nationalized and permanently standing , as well - funded as it is poorly led .
The late Colonel David Hackworth , a veteran of several 20th century American wars overseas , referred to " perfumed princes " in an article he wrote in 1987 — several years before the Cold War ended .
Echoing both Lt General Smedley Butler circa 1933 and President Eisenhower , who warned of the unseemly power of our military - industrial complex in early 1961 , Hackworth defined these men as " corporate generals and admirals [ who should be sent ] packing to industry where their brilliance would be well used … "
The " perfumed princes " that Hackworth believed should be sent packing to industry were indeed going to industry , and instead of seeking the nation ’s peace and security , these perfumed princes were then , as they are today , completely vested in war and insecurity .
Several months ago , Congressman Ron Paul asked a top general , a man who is today the Central Command Combatant Commander , a question related to the United States Constitution .
Dr. Paul asked , " Does the administration have the authority to bomb Iran without further congressional approval ? "
I assume that General Petraeus is familiar with Article I , Section Eight of the constitution , granting the power to declare war to the Congress , and expressly not granting that power to any single man or woman who may be angry , frustrated , ill - informed or trying to gain the approval of his or her play group .
I think it is fair to say that this general , in his now famous response — " That ’s not my purview " — demurred , sidestepped , and lied , in the manner of all perfumed princes .
More recently , the mainstream media was shocked , shocked to learn that a long list of well - known so - called military experts were receiving and devotedly parroting page after page , year after year , Pentagon and White House - drafted talking points .
I hate to disagree with Colonel Hackworth , but I do believe he overstated the brilliance of the generals and admirals .
They are as undistinguished and ordinary in the corporate world as Hackworth understood them to be in the world of war .
Thus , the empire is bankrupt , bereft of talent and capacity .
It spends 2 and a half billion dollars a day on its " security apparatus , " over a trillion dollars a year .
Its green eyeshaders , like apocalyptic horsemen , gallop faster and faster as the currency debases , spending monstrous sums on military maintenance and training , the conduct of current wars , and funding that overfed toddler we call the intelligence community in order to ensure future wars .
Our military , the one we say fights for freedom and peace around the world , is a grand Gulliver , bound and disabled and continually amazed by what it encounters on the Island of Lilliput .
The American empire is unsustainable at home , by American workers and homemakers , and as Herb Stein famously observed , " Things that ca n’t go on forever , do n’t . "
But it is n’t just that national , ideological , and corporate imperialism cannot create value or produce widgets over the long term .
It is n’t just that government largesse necessarily stifles real capital formation , or that the Leviathan necessarily murders freedom .
Less obviously , but I think perhaps more importantly , is how the dichotomy between America ’s sense of self and her actual self since the later19th century has already defeated our " city on the hill " - derived globalism .
The USA Today newspaper reported last December that , " The Lakota Sioux Indians , whose ancestors include Sitting Bull , Red Cloud and Crazy Horse , have withdrawn from all treaties their forefathers signed with the U.S. government and have declared their independence .
A delegation delivered the news to the State Department … . "
The report goes on to note that the United States government is in violation of 33 treaties with the Lakota Sioux .
Along these same lines , CNN reported recently that a group of Hawaiians took over the old Hawaiian monarchy ’s royal residence and vowed to conduct the kingdom ’s government .
CNN noted , " The group is one of several in Hawaii that reject statehood and seek to return to the constitutional monarchy that effectively ended in 1893 when a group of politicians , businessmen and sugar planters — aided by the U.S. minister to Hawaii — overthrew the kingdom ’s government . "
Last month , National Public Radio did a short series on the Indian boarding school system , its origins and history .
This history was pertinent because from NPR ’s perspective , the modern and evolved federal boarding schools were in terrible danger of losing their funding .
But in this report , as with the news of the declared independence of the Lakota Nation , we see and hear of occupation , misuse of military force against the weak , theft of land and resources , re-education of the individual by and for the central state , and the ever - ratcheting and expansive nature of government lies .
These mainstream media stories remind us of past and present federal efforts to contain and control native American peoples .
We could have been talking about what our federal government is doing in Iraq , or Afghanistan , because the methods and the motivations are much the same .
I ’m all for truth , justice and the revolutionary American way .
It seems like we spend a lot of time discussing whether or not we should be proud of " America " or whether supporting the troops abroad and at home means supporting the idiotic and unconstitutional government that placed them there .
We witness and sometimes participate in artificial morality plays , when we try to determine if the government murder of some people is OK , and whether government torture under some circumstances is ethical .
George W. Bush , speaking for the government , has repeatedly said , " We do not torture . "
Could it be that he assumes the imperial " We ? "
If so , he may be correct .
Individual people torture , and individual people kill and maim other people , destroy their homes and futures , shoot their livestock , topple their buildings .
Perhaps the inanity of our troubled little Caesar is actually part of a larger plan to destroy the imperial mindset , and restore the Republic .
It goes without saying that the rest of the world is wise to our existing empire , its financial and military incorporation , and its trite and transparent ideological propaganda .
Our government likes to demonize those who have the temerity to speak honestly and publicly about our empire .
We say Chavez is the new Castro , Putin the new Stalin , Ahmadinejad the new Hitler .
Some Americans and most non-Americans know enough about the European , Soviet and Cold War history to realize that the Castro , Stalin or Hitler flavor of the month is government propaganda directed specifically at a poorly educated American audience , and at no one else .
America ’s governmental mythology — Murray Rothbard referred to it as the " carefully nurtured mystique of government " — is being rejected around the world , and by Americans themselves .
This rejection is a beautiful thing , and it occurs daily , even minute - by - minute , at LewRockwell.com , the Future of Freedom Foundation , antiwar.com and a whole host of free market institutions , political movements and organizations .
It is especially wonderful to see the idea of global empire pummelled and gutted , usually unintentionally , in the pages of USA Today and the New York Times , to watch it on CNN and to listen via National Public Radio .
When the very purveyors and beneficiaries of American empire and presumed hegemony inadvertently educate average Americans on the costs of empire , and the truth of our imperial history , it is a very good thing , and it signals the end of empire .
Americans hear about nation building in Iraq and Afghanistan , and they ask for it back home , in storm - and flood - and fire - ravaged cities in the south and west and in the heartland .
Americans hear about roads and bridges being constructed and repaired abroad , and they ’d like to see our tax dollars at home working on those exact same projects .
Americans hear about the so - called security services our troops provide overseas , and they ’d like to see that security applied at our ports and on our borders , even in our troubled urban areas .
When Americans are told that they must wait for this kind of nation - building and security at home because our economy is in a tailspin , our government is broke , and the two primary political parties have matching unconstitutional war agendas , they begin to understand the nature of centralized unaccountable lawless imperial - minded government .
And they inherently despise it .
This is how crazy it is .
A recent set of articles by Frida Berrigan of the New America Foundation summarizes seven key missions assumed by the Pentagon under the current administration .
These range from being America ’s intelligence agency , her domestic disaster manager , and by far the largest recipient of non-entitlement federal spending .
They also include the roles of America ’s global diplomat , global arms dealer , global humanitarian responder , and global viceroy of space and the heavens .
It sounds surreal , unbelievable .
It is a comedic parody of centralization of power , hubris , and incompetence .
Augustine wrote
The City of God in the early 400s , at the time of the late and undeniable collapse of the Roman Empire , which had been considered a Christian Empire for nearly 200 years .
Augustine wrote something that defines empire and clearly labels the hypocrisy that is its undoing .
Many of you have probably heard or read this before , but it is worth repeating here :
Without justice , what are kingdoms but great robber bands ?
What are robber bands but small kingdoms ?
The band is itself made up of men , is ruled by the command of a leader , and is held together by a social pact .
Plunder is divided in accordance with an agreed upon law .
If this evil increases by the inclusion of dissolute men to the extent that it takes over territory , establishes headquarters , occupies cities , and subdues peoples , it publicly assumes the title of kingdom !
A fitting and true response was once given to Alexander the Great by an apprehended pirate .
When asked by the king what he thought he was doing by infesting the sea , he replied with noble insolence , “ What do you think you are doing by infesting the whole world ?
Because I do it with one puny boat , I am called a pirate ; because you do it with a great fleet , you are called an emperor . ”
The American empire is collapsing — and as with the natural collapse of other empires , people in and out of the empire ’s grasp simply stop believing some decades and generations before the physical end .
This is where we are today — and unlike all previous empires in collapse , we live in an age of rapid communication , and instant access to history , research , commentary and imagery available for the asking .
Tradition and habit can keep an empire on life support for centuries , at least it worked this way centuries before now .
Today , change can come as quickly as ideas can travel , guide and inform individual choices and actions .
We could identify many more signs of our collapsing empire , from professional expeditionary mercenary forces posing as defense , to the absolute lack of real debate on the future by our fundamentally one - party governing establishment .
There is a modern cliché that fits : it is what it is .
Those Americans deeply invested in empire will face painful change .
But at the same time , opportunities for freedom , for restrained republican government , for prosperity and purpose exist , and they are available now for the rest of us .
And remember , we are the majority .
We can conceive of these opportunities on several levels , and in the next few minutes , I ’d like to explore some specifics .
Last year at this venue , I spoke of restoring the Republic .
Some listeners were surprised when I veered around and past the idea of a single massive republic for this country , and suggested that a confederation of independent republics and states might work .
This would reverse the Lincoln legacy , a sacrilege in Washington , but not a bad idea for the rest of the country .
When we speak of empire , we speak of the taking and controlling of subordinate regions and people , motivated by the economic interests of the politically connected , and justified by a public ideology of patriotic and moral goodness .
Certainly the Civil War could be described as a militarized policy to restrict the southern capitalism that was squeezing Northern industrial and banking interests , energized by a widespread moral rationale that was leveraged by political leaders .
Subsequent imperial expansion and interventions , from the Indian wars , the Hawaiian annexation , the Spanish - American War , U.S. involvement in the first and second world wars , and the 70 - plus military interventions since then — including the ones we see in Afghanistan and Iraq — have all met this same criteria .
When we speak of opportunities for restoring the republic , we need to imagine a time in American government that we have not seen in 200 years .
It is that republican ideal we should seek to restore .
Really small government .
Weak and poorly nourished government .
Government that approaches us rarely , and when it does , behaves like a friendly yet uncertain puppy .
In my lifetime , the Libertarian Party has typically articulated this kind of vision .
But what is typically not articulated is the kind of person who creates this kind of small , benign government , and thrives under it , the kind of person who resists feeding and entertaining the cute little puppy .
Baby animals evolved to be cute , rounded , fuzzy and submissive — because cute , rounded , fuzzy and submissive baby animals tend to get more positive attention from parents and others , and thus survive to make more creatures who regardless of how obscenely frightening , monstrous , and aggressive they are destined to be when they grow up , are friendly and appealing in their infantile state .
So it is with government — and this is an aspect of the leviathan problem that defeats the wisest constitution .
Government also grows and centralizes , empires expand until they collapse because we the people want to be good , rich , and admired — but all on the cheap .
Luckily for us today in America , we are getting an object lesson on how being " good " on the cheap , through the ambition of ideologues and fools , and the sacrifice of other fools and conscripts far from home , is immoral , and costs way more than advertised for far less benefit .
Instead of being admired and venerated , we are feared and hated by the rest of the world .
Instead of gaining wealth and freedom , we see our own lives and livelihoods made debt - bound and fruitless .
We wonder why — and often we do n’t understand our own culpability in the misery of tyranny .
Etienne de La Botie , a French lawyer and philosopher in the middle 1500 ’s , shared his thoughts on this problem in " The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude . "
De La Botie wondered , " What strange phenomenon is this ?
What name shall we give it ?
What is the nature of this misfortune ?
What vice is it , or , rather , what degradation ?
To see an endless multitude of people not merely obeying , but driven to servility ?
Not ruled , but tyrannized over ? "
He describes the typical tyrant , and we recognize the type ,
[ The people ] suffer plundering , wantonness , cruelty , not from an army , not from a barbarian horde , on account of whom they must shed their blood and sacrifice their lives , but from a single man ; not from a Hercules nor from a Samson , but from a single little man .
Too frequently this same little man is the most cowardly and effeminate in the nation , a stranger to the powder of battle and hesitant on the sands of the tournament ; …
To end the tyranny and the empire , to reverse the concentration of power , to stop the ambitious Leviathan , de La Botie — at the age of 18 years — advised simply :
[ T ] here is no need of fighting to overcome this single tyrant , for he is automatically defeated if the country refuses consent to its own enslavement : it is not necessary to deprive him of anything , but simply to give him nothing ; there is no need that the country make an effort to do anything for itself provided it does nothing against itself .
It is therefore the inhabitants themselves who permit , or , rather , bring about , their own subjection , since by ceasing to submit they would put an end to their servitude .
A people enslaves itself , cuts its own throat , when , having a choice between being vassals and being free men , it deserts its liberties and takes on the yoke , gives consent to its own misery , …
We are speaking today of the collapse of the American empire , and it is collapsing precisely because so many are already doing what La Botie advises — giving the tyrant nothing , ceasing to submit to his authority , living as free men !
Simply knowing that this is what is happening by us , around us , and throughout the country — and so too , the rest of the world , is powerful .
We need to recognize this fact — this reality in this moment .
The Ron Paul banner — revolution , with emphasis on the letters L — O — V — E , is in perfect concert with the way things really do change .
The way we think about the collapse of empire is key to actually restoring a republic , and in recognizing the opportunities inherent in the collapse .
If we see the American Empire , and its well - funded military machine grasping around the world , deep into the heartland , and into space , as some massive physical entity — the collapse will indeed be a catastrophic event .
Catastrophes , like the black plague in Europe , always bring new opportunities , often painfully forced through death , poverty , starvation and crisis .
But our American empire , this economic and militaristic dominatrix , is less a physical entity than an idea we voluntarily embrace , and even those of us who dedicate ourselves to targeting the empire can , by our very obsession , overstate our empire ’s inherent abilities and power .
The empire we speak of , and bemoan , and indeed from which we suffer economically and morally — is little more than a veneer .
The emperor has no clothes ; we know the fable well .
It is also true that the American empire itself is hollow , a movie set with authentic looking building fronts , but with nothing behind them .
The currency of our empire , whether fiat money or military effectiveness , is likewise not believable , and therefore not valued .
The American empire rests entirely on our belief in it — take away that faith , and we shed the empire .
The collapse of empire is really the act — by each one of us — of rising up from our knees , and brushing off the dust .
Thus — what are our opportunities , as we rise up in freedom ?
How do we help our families , neighbors , friends , and those in our network to rise up in freedom ?
I ’d like to discuss three simple things that we can do to leverage , to speed , and perhaps , to ease the process of returning to republicanism .
The first is cultivating a certain quality of mind .
If we wish to be self - governed politically , we must first be self - governed individually .
To be self - governed is to live our lives as we wish , in complete concert with our deeply held values , boldly , every day .
To live this way , we must be educated , logical and morally brave — all qualities of mind .
We must move ourselves , our children and grandchildren , friends and neighbors , continually in this direction .
Mark
Twain once said , " I have never let my schooling interfere with my education . "
We know that these qualities of mind are never the result of public schooling and public employment , but it is important to remember they are certainly not precluded by it .
Education is not just about knowing facts or gathering up information .
Cullen Murphy , former Atlantic Monthly editor and writer , studied similarities between Rome and the United States in his most recent book .
He speaks of a " fatal parochialism " of Roman citizens , " … a lack of interest in the outside world , even among the elites . "
As a result , the Romans — government , military and people — were " often taken by surprise . "
Think about that .
Many of us who are libertarian , or anarcho - capitalist , or part of the anti-interventionist right or left — we got there by thinking and reading , listening and observing — and I do n’t think a single one of us has n’t stumbled upon some surprising bit of perfect wisdom from older and other cultures .
We may have started with the Bible , but beyond that we discovered that governing dilemmas , issues of human liberty and human slavery , human choices have been debated and examined by the brightest men and women for centuries .
We cherish the founders , especially the anti-federalists for their fierce devotion to liberty , and their passionate distrust of centralized political power .
Yet they too based their understanding on those who went before — they were educated beyond the parochial — beyond narrow confines of a single country , a single era , a single religion , a single narrow philosophy , a single career specialty .
The recent tell - all book by Scott McClellan depicts George W. Bush as intellectually uncurious and prone to self - deception .
When the book came out a few weeks ago , the White House inadvertently confirmed its former spokesman by saying it was " surprised " and " puzzled , " claiming that this was not the Scott McClellan it knew .
For those familiar with the history of Washington politics and this administration in particular , little that Scott McClellan is saying is new or surprising .
When one knows nothing , everything is surprising , puzzling , a mystery .
To promote the qualities of mind suitable for a free people , we should learn — and keep learning — both classically and technologically .
Not that long ago , I thought about iPods in a very parochial way .
I thought they were for popular music and not really useful for me — modern entertainment only .
But iPods are for podcasts and lectures , movies , educational videos , documentaries , and for sharing , discussing and creating new knowledge , new perspectives .
Most things that innovators create , within the capitalistic systems that reward and enable them , are not end items at all — but stepping stones to more innovation , new ways of living , thinking , producing .
Think about the Internet — we probably all used it to get here , to prepare ourselves , to pay our bills .
Some of us may be using it right now !
Its predecessor , the first packet switching data transfer system , was called Arpanet .
It was created as a way for the Pentagon to maintain command and control over its missiles and bombers after a nuclear attack had destroyed the central control point .
The goal was to maintain functionality through the strength of independent self - organizing decentralization .
We no longer worry about fighting a force - on - force nuclear war with a communist superpower , and we rarely mention the Arpanet .
But there is an absolute rationality in decentralized , adaptable , and flexible information transfer .
Through this magic
Macs can talk to PC ’s can talk to cell phones can talk to blackberries can talk to convection ovens and automobiles , you name it .
Certainly the incredible potential for individual empowerment and networking , for capitalism , was not envisioned by the federal government .
Had it fully realized what only the marketplace of human desire and ingenuity could know , it would have resisted the technology as incompatible with centralized control and top - down order that is the hallmark of government and empire .
In fact , government has resisted the free - market - driven Internet since the beginning , albeit mostly without success .
In an information - saturated world , we do yearn for simplicity and clarity .
Often , this yearning is satisfied by slogans and labels .
The challenge before us is to satisfy human desire for clarity and simplicity through a moral , logical and accessible approach to politics , economics , and government .
Thanks to Ron Paul ’s presidential run , and his wonderful book The Revolution , millions of Americans are now learning about , talking about , and wondering about liberty , the founder ’s intentions , and even the workings of the Federal Reserve and fractional banking .
To help more people adopt a quality of mind that is unafraid of learning , unafraid of thinking — we can share the right kind of books and articles , the right kinds of audio and video recordings , the right kind of ideas via personal contact , and our own creative leveraging of all types of communication , and all types of inspiration .
Information and education must be exchanged , like certain vitamins , in forms that can be effectively absorbed and utilized by the body politic .
I read somewhere recently that in the age of Shakespeare , most people in England were unable to read , illiterate .
To broadly share information and ideas , the preferred medium was audible , spoken , and theatrical , and in fact , nothing else worked .
For writers to complain that " people do n’t read anymore " is not only untrue , it is parochial thinking — something we have to get over .
It is about learning — not necessarily reading .
In our age , we have a vast audience of readers , viewers , and listeners , and multiple avenues for sharing new freedom - oriented ways of thinking about life and societal order .
Through our attention , time , finances and care , we can support any number of organizations and individuals who promote the creative and critical thought process that future free Americans must cultivate .
We can support a more honest understanding of our country ’s history , and increased study of the founders and their philosophy .
We can support a wider awareness of economics as it really operates through the promotion of the Austrian school , and the work of the Mises Institute and Liberty Fund .
We can support , by reading , viewing and sharing , the outstanding contributions to the national conversation offered by the Future of Freedom Foundation , Foundation for Economic Education , the Independent Institute , LewRockwell.com and even the Cato Institute , among so many others .
We can support the parents in this country who have liberated their precious children from public schooling .
According to the Alliance for the Separation of School and State , these 8 million liberated students equate to the entire student body of 25 different states and Washington , D.C .
This one area of information flow , targeted in support of a living liberty , is full of opportunity .
At worst , each of us is individually improved and made wiser , a little more free and a little more bold .
At best , a whole country may live free , and win the battle against cowardly bureaucracy , consummate centralization , and the inhumanity of the empire .
A second set of opportunities for a new republic amidst the ongoing collapse is economic — and yet it relates as all things do , to how we think and what we believe .
Economics is a battlefield where centralized socialized control of choice and human action — call it communism , socialism or fascism — constantly moves to crush economic liberty and capitalism .
Augustine ’s pirate boldly advises the emperor that it is he who is the greater criminal .
1200 years later , Frdric Bastiat described what he called the " legal plunder " conducted daily by the state .
The most well - known Marxist treatise is Das Capital , a recognition that society and government is linked to its economic system .
In Ron Paul ’s seminal book , The Revolution , two of the seven concise chapters are dedicated to this topic of human and state economy .
What are the economic opportunities in the collapsing empire , and how do we discern them ?
Pete Schiff ’s latest book , Crashproof : How to Profit from the Coming Collapse , is an example of economic advice suited to the collapse of empire .
Bill Bonner and Addison Wiggins ’ Empire of Debt and Financial Reckoning Day come to mind .
There are many others .
For those of us who have little money , the question of where to invest has more to do with the resources we all have — our interests , our study , our work and our time .
In a collapsing empire , the answer is not difficult .
Do not invest your interest , study , work and time in those activities that depend on a robust empire , a grand centralized state , and the plunder of others .
The American way of empire , and the American leviathan , is not only corrupt and deadly , it is ending .
At a minimum , we ought to avoid throwing good money after bad .
Beyond that , the choices of where to spend our money and time are really wide open .
What works ?
What is republican in concept ?
What do we like and value in a free society ?
This is where to put your money and your time .
We find it easy to advise others to avoid meat , or fur , or genetically modified food , to recycle or to buy shade - grown coffee .
It should be as easy and as common to advise others to avoid funding and supporting the deadly enterprise of empire .
As the empire collapses around us , we need to recognize that capitalism is , and has been for centuries , made to be a villain with few defenders .
If one considers the economic policies of the main contenders for king of the empire , we find hard - core socialism offered by Obama .
The Club for Growth said , " Senator McCain ’s eager embrace of grossly inaccurate class - warfare demagoguery demonstrated , at best , a painful ignorance of pro-growth economic principles . "
Bob Barr ’s run for President as a libertarian offers some hope — his economic platform is based on reduced federal spending and corporate welfare , and sadly , replacing the income tax with a national sales tax .
But only when you look under the issue of individual liberty on Barr ’s website do you see veiled reference to unfettered capitalism , and then only if you use your imagination .
American revolutionary Patrick Henry wrote , " Perfect freedom is as necessary to the health and vigor of commerce as it is to the health and vigor of citizenship . "
In 1956 , not so long ago , Ludwig von Mises published a small book entitled The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality .
In it , he tried to understand and explain why the social organization of capitalism — the very engine of progress and prosperity — is misunderstood by average people , discredited by politicians , and hated by the intellectual and chattering classes .
He points out that representative government — the foundation of any republic — has a " constitutional corollary . "
This constitutional corollary is " economic freedom , consummated in the market economy ( capitalism ) . "
Mises explains in a variety of ways how the social and political deck is stacked against the system in which we vote with our capital .
In this system , merit and competition determines winners and losers .
More importantly , capitalism ’s " winners " can never rest on their laurels , never indulge for long in sloth , in pride , in gluttony , greed , lust , envy or even wrath .
In a free market , such indulgences open the door to less slothful , less greedy , less prideful , less angry competitors .
If capitalism is the constitutional corollary for a republican form of government , it is also a moral corollary for living a good and productive life .
Yet — as Mises points out , " [ As a result of economic ignorance ] … as [ the people ] see it , the unprecedented technological improvements of the last two hundred years were not caused or furthered by the economic policies of the age .
They were not an achievement of classical liberalism , free trade , laissez faire and capitalism .
They will therefore go on under any other system of society ’s economic organization . "
This misconception underlies the American tendency to undervalue capitalism as a system of social organization .
It underlies the ongoing American willingness to sacrifice capitalism as a necessary evil , instead of as the fundamental factor responsible for lifting men and women far beyond expectations of birth and class , while delivering an improved quality of life and livelihood for everyone .
Even among free market conservatives and libertarians , we often fail to aggressively and vocally defend capitalism , in the face of a constant onslaught here at home , in the world ’s fifth most economically free country , according to the Heritage Foundation .
Ron Paul ’s latest book is an excellent vehicle to combat this anti-capitalistic mentality here at home , and a nice companion book , that may help us be more proud and more vehement promoters of capitalism beyond our normal circles , is Mises Institute Fellow Robert Murphy ’s The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism .
When the empire collapses , unless unfettered capitalism prevails , we will not have a republic .
In its place , we will have a contracted empire , a grand putrefying socialist corpse .
Many in this room , throughout the country , and around the world , worry that America has adopted a form of national socialism , even as we wave the tattered flag of a constitutional republic , and spout endlessly the verbiage of freedom .
If we are to be republicans living in a republic , we must preserve and defend unfettered capitalism , and be prepared to fight for it .
There is one other category of opportunity in this collapsing empire , beyond that to educate for self - government , and to preserve and defend the conduct and honor of capitalism .
This last category is also the most fun , and perhaps , if we do it well , it will cover sins of omission in the first two .
In the quote I used earlier , regarding the conversation between the pirate and Alexander the great , the particular translation uses the phrase , " noble insolence . "
Noble insolence was the attitude of the lowly pirate , in his answer to Alexander the Great , a fearsome emperor and warrior .
Noble insolence .
It is n’t shock - talk radio , and it is n’t Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh , or even much of what is offered on Air America or at Reason Magazine .
Noble insolence is n’t a wisecracking or overly poetic preacher , seeking to wake up his congregation , and make them remember his advice .
And it is n’t plain old insolence , defined as " contemptuously rude or impertinent behavior or speech . "
I think a better way of understanding this concept is to look at the archaic definition of insolence , which is " The quality of being unusual or novel . "
Of course , noble means of superior quality , admirable and distinguished .
We should all take some time to think about , and to practice , this noble insolence .
The American empire is a socialistic and increasingly authoritarian leviathan .
As Anthony Gregory described it yesterday , the state has become brazen .
Yet this empire is the social and political system under which we have grown up and to which we have become accustomed .
If we are to live free , we will by default be unusual and novel — even as this novelty and rarity echoes the wisdom of those before us , and reflects the fundamental values of millions of normally silent Americans .
In a time when a failing , panicked , and hungry centralized state will react to its ongoing collapse by attempting to persist , survive , and to expand in size and import — our leadership , courage , and idealism — in Alex Cockburn ’s words , the " spirit of mutiny " — is more necessary than ever .
It is one thing to recognize and understand what is happening ; it is another to actually live and work freely , to loudly challenge statist stupidity wherever it is found , and to practice noble insolence .
It is easy to learn and think about self - governance , and to find fault with the empire at hand , and to wish for an improved or renewed constitutional republic .
For us , as lovers of capitalism , it is easy to see how the unfettered free market is consistent with improved quality of the lives and the overall moral and meritorious conduct of all people .
But to challenge orthodoxy when it seems as if we are outnumbered , or in the face of seeming great power , in a country that is militaristic in both attitude and economy , this is a real challenge .
We face barriers to the truth we may wish to promote , whether is it in the form of aggressive smears or institutional silence from an establishment invested in empire .
We face practical and physical assault on our freedom if we challenge the empire here at home , whether on the so - called public highways and airways , our over - regulated private enterprises , our property and our capital .
Noble insolence in the face of all these things is truly necessary , and it is a great and difficult duty of republican citizenship .
I ’d like to share a quote from Leo Tolstoy , who discovered what we are discovering about morality and freedom , statism and tyrants .
He did not live to see the communization of Russia , the public acceptance of many forms of fascism , or totalitarianism ’s persistence .
He did not live to see the peaceful rejection of unjust government inspired by Gandhi in India , and some other places .
He is not here to see Americans claim their peaceful , free , non-interventionist birthright — something we are chartered to do , or to die trying .
Tolstoy wrote :
That this social order with its pauperism , famines , prisons , gallows , armies , and wars is necessary to society ; that still greater disaster would ensue if this organization were destroyed ; all this is said only by those who profit by this organization , while those who suffer from it — and they are ten times as numerous — think and say quite the contrary .
De La Botie wrote on this great fact as well , when he advised ,
Resolve to serve no more , and you are at once freed .
I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over , but simply that you support him no longer ; then you will behold him , like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away , fall of his own weight and break in pieces .
I ’d like to conclude with something closer to home .
Not too far from here , in 1775 , Patrick Henry advised his fellow Virginians to fight , and many were a little reluctant .
He told them ,
We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power .
The millions of people , armed in the holy cause of liberty , and in such a country as that which we possess , are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us .
Besides , sir , we shall not fight our battles alone .
There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations , and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us .
The battle , sir , is not to the strong alone ; it is to the vigilant , the active , the brave .
We are Tolstoy ’s majority , ten times more numerous than those who enforce the current order of empire .
We are de La Botie ’s heirs , who take his advice and end the support that upholds the state Colossus .
And we are Patrick Henry ’s vigilant , active and brave army , seizing today and tomorrow every opportunity to live free , honest , prosperous and honorable lives in a re-emergent American Republic .
The Best of Karen Kwiatkowski
Safe sex through the use of condoms is part of Gabriele Paolini 's message Prolific Italian TV prankster and condom advocate Gabriele Paolini faces a prison sentence unless he behaves .
Mr Paolini has made a career of popping up uninvited behind unwitting on - air TV reporters promoting condom use .
Guinness World Records says Mr Paolini is the world 's most successful TV hijacker , interrupting 20,000 link - ups .
But now Italy 's Supreme Court has upheld a three - month suspended sentence on him for interrupting a report on the state broadcaster RAI in June 2001 .
The court has also ruled that anyone who deliberately gets onto TV while standing in a public place can commit an offence even if they are silent and immobile .
' Prophylactic prophet '
While Mr Paolini has made a name for himself by bobbing about and generally disrupting reporters ' efforts to be serious , he is more than just an attention - seeker , says the BBC's Mark Duff in Milan .
He calls himself the prophylactic prophet - not just because his antics often involve condoms , but because he sees his capers as a way of drawing attention to the plight of Aids sufferers .
It was the death of a friend from the disease which launched him on his career of disruption .
Even before the court 's ruling , Mr Paolini had not always had things his own way , our correspondent says : reporters have been known to lash out at him in frustration , sometimes on camera .

How do I use andand to write a gem , or a library , or a Rails Plugin , or anything else that I have to share with other people ?
— Stan
sneer at
p.s. I hope you can answer this , I ’m sure the answer will also be interesting to people working on large teams who want to use something like andand but do not want to go through a big bureaucratic process getting the entire team to agree that it should be pervasive across the project .
If you can use something like andand in one place without changing Ruby globally , that will make a lot of people happy .
— Stan
Dear Raganwald : I love the andand gem you posted , and I have been using it on all my projects .
It really does help make the code easier to read because it focuses on what I am actually trying to do and not on the bookkeeping of writing extra if statements and superfluous local variables just to handle nil checking when it is really an edge case .
How can any one argue with Person. find (...).andand.name ?
Fabulous !!!
And when I am writing my own project , I simply laugh at the doom - and - gloom naysayers who howl about open classes leading to conflicts .
andand does n’t change any object ’s existing behaviour , it extends it , in the sense that your post about Strict Liskov Equivalence talks about subclasses extending superclass behaviour and not redefining it .
Cool .
It ’s easy to use something like andand on a project and not screw things up .
It just takes a modicum of common sense rather than a slavish fear of what - we - do - not - understand .
Ok , now I have one question .
I am sorry to write , but I could n’t find the answer in the docs .
Quite simply , how do I use andand to write a gem , or a library , or a Rails Plugin , or anything else that I have to share with other people ?
You see , I like andand but I do n’t want to force my opinions on the people using my stuff .
So for example , I have this great idea for a Ruby Gem that adds syntactic metaprogramming so that I have an answer for the Ocaml and Lisp folks when they question Ruby .
But while I desperately want to use andand to write the gem , I am worried that perhaps the people who use my gem do n’t want to install andand into all of their work ?
Perhaps they will be annoyed if they discover that I have extended the Object class ?
You know that this is innocuous , and I know that this is innocuous , but perhaps they want to pick and choose their own way of handling nils ?
Perhaps — misguided though this may be — they do n’t want Object altered in any way , no matter how much safer it is to extend rather than modify it ?
Or maybe they like andand .
A lot .
And maybe it ’s worth it to them to figure out what it does and decide it ’s a great addition .
But if every gem they install installs one , or two , or even three things like andand , at some point they will throw their hands up in the air and yell , “ Enough ! ” Decisions about projects should always be made with a certain perspective , I think you have said that yourself in some of your essays about time management .
It seems wrong to force the people who use my code to decide whether they want andand in their project when they have to decide whether to install its dependencies .
So .
How do I use something like andand without forcing it downstream on the people who use my code ?
Thanks in advance , Signed , Your biggest fan , Stan .
Purely Functional Retrogames , Part 3
( Read Part 1 if you missed it . )
Every entity in a game needs some data to define where it is and what it 's doing .
At first thought , a ghost in Pac - Man might be defined by :
{X , Y , Color}
which looks easy enough , but it 's naive .
There needs to be a lot more data than that : direction of movement , behavior state , some base clock values for animation , etc .
And this is just simplistic Pac - Man .
In an imperative or OO language this topic barely deserves thought .
Just create a structure or object for each entity type and add fields as the situation arises .
If the structure eventually contains 50 fields , who cares ?
But ...
In a functional language , the worst thing you can do is create a large " struct " containing all the data you think you might need for an entity .
First , this does n't scale well .
Each time you want to " change " a field value , a whole new structure is created .
For Pac - Man it 's irrelevant -- there are only a handful of entities .
But the key is that if you add a single field , then you 're adding overhead across the board to all of the entity processing in your entire program .
The second reason this is a bad idea is that it hides the flow of data .
You no longer know what values are important to a function .
You 're just passing in everything , and that makes it harder to experiment with writing simple , obviously correct primitives .
Which is less opaque :
step_toward ( {X , Y} , TargetX , TargetY , Speed ) -> ... step_toward ( EntityData , TargetX , TargetY , Speed ) -> ...
The advantage of the first one is that you do n't need to know what an entity looks like .
You might not have thought that far ahead , which is fine .
You 've got a simple function for operating on coordinate pairs which can be used in a variety of places , not just for entity movement .
If we can't use a big struct , what does an entity look like ?
There are undoubtedly many ways to approach this , but I came up with the following scheme .
Fundamentally , an entity is defined by an ID of some sort ( " I am one of those fast moving spinning things in Robotron " ) , movement data ( a position and maybe velocity ) , and the current behavioral state .
At the highest level :
{ Id , Position , State}
Each of these has more data behind it , and that data varies based on the entity type , the current behavior , and so on .
Position might be one of the following :
{X , Y} {X , Y , XVelocity , YVelocity}
State might look like :
{ Name , StartTime , EndTime} { Name , StartTime , EndTime , SomeStateSpecificData}
StartTime is so there 's a base clock to use for animation or to know how long the current state has been running .
EndTime is the time in the future when the state should end ; it is n't needed for all states .
In my experiments , this scheme got me pretty far .
Everything is very clean at a high level - - a three element tuple -- and below that there 's still the absolute minimum amount of data not only per entity type , but for the exact state that the entity is in .
Compare that to the normal " put everything in a struct " approach , where fields needed only for the " return to center of maze " ghost logic are always sitting there , unused in most states .
But wait , what about additional state information , such as indicating that a Pac - Man ghost is invulnerable ( which is true when a ghost has been reduced to a pair of eyes returning to the center of the maze ) ?
If you remember Part 2 , then the parenthetical note in the previous sentence should give it away .
If the ghost is invulnerable when in a specific state , then there 's no need for a separate flag .
Just check the state .

What Will the Future of TV Look Like in 20 Years ?
Ready or not , the future of TV is here .
In the last twenty years , we ’ve seen a huge surge in technological innovations .
Netflix went from a DVD subscription to a huge library of digital movies .
YouTube and Facebook have launched entire entertainment careers , from Bo Burham to Awkwafina .
TVs have better definition , and they ’re cheaper to buy .
We can now enjoy television from our phones , our computers , and even our cars .
With all these rapid changes , one might wonder what the future of TV holds .
We ’re not fortune tellers , but here are five predictions about what we ’ll see in the next twenty years .
The Future of TV Is Apps , Not Channels
You might have already experienced this : you ’re in the mood to watch your favorite sitcom , but you have to find the right app for it .
Is it on Netflix or Hulu ?
The future of TV suggests this dilemma is n’t going anywhere .
Ten years ago you had your favorite channels , like HGTV or Cartoon Network ( for the younger crowd ) .
Now it ’s more likely that you have a favorite streaming service .
Now Disney announced their own apps , and Facebook has original “ watch ” content .
It ’s clear that app surfing is only going to be more popular .
Invisible Accessories Like Speakers
The world wants technology , but they do n’t want it to be intrusive .
So while we ’ll keep buying extra tech accessories , we want them to be small and near invisible .
The television is a perfect example .
More television companies are producing TVs with invisible speakers .
The speaker is behind the TV instead of hiding in the bottom .
This lets manufacturers create larger speakers for a better sound .
Television for Your Decor
Speaking of hidden technology , the future of TV is television that doubles as decor .
Instead of building a room around a screen , homeowners are looking for TVs built into the walls .
There are also televisions that look like framed photos .
When you ’re not watching TV , the screen will display a family photo or piece of art .
Whatever you get , do n’t forget the warranty .
It pays more to learn more about protecting your tech .
Voice Activated Controls
Voice activated computers and televisions have been a dream since Star Trek days .
And while we already have TVs that are voice activated , the verbal commands are clunky .
But now AI developers have turned their attention to the entertainment industry .
There are already voice - activated controls with XBox and Kinect .
It ’s only a matter of time before you can tell your television to play your favorite movie with a single command .
More Screens
Screens are a part of our everyday world .
From our computers to TVs , we ’re surrounded by screens .
The future of TV suggests we ’re only going to see more of that .
Many people think that with new smart - cars doing the driving for us , we ’ll be able to enjoy TV at our leisure .
So while you should n’t watch your favorite show in the car now , wait a few years .
You ’ll be bingeing TV on long road trips in no time .

Power Systems & Controls Inc. , ( PS&C ) , is an American manufacturer with World Headquarters in Richmond , Virginia , since 1965 .
We have been manufacturing Power Products and Tactical Enclosures in support of the United States Government and Industrial / Commercial customers .
Our manufactured power quality products include Uninterruptible Power Supplies , Frequency Converters , and Power Factor Correction products .
In addition to our Power Quality products , we manufacture Enclosure and Shelter solutions used in many applications worldwide .
Along with our Uninterruptible Power Supply Systems and Frequency Converters , PS&C builds many other Power Conditioning products .
These products include Motor Generator Sets , Power Factor Correction , Voltage Regulators , and Grid Stabilizers to mention a few .
Similar to our converters , ( Rotary Frequency Converter and Static Frequency Converter ) , we offer rotary and solid state versions .
Frequency Converters :
There are 2 typologies for Frequency Converters .
Rotary Frequency Converters are manufactured using a Motor Generator set .
Static Frequency Converters are manufactured with solid state electronics and semi-conductors .
Although each topology has its own advantages , they can be used interchangeably .
The Rotary Frequency Converters is a harsh environment industrial machine .
Whereas , the Static Frequency Converters are designed and built for non-industrial and less harsh applications .
Another hybrid product built is a converter that will maintain power output when the utility is no longer available .
This converter is also a UPS , called a Frequency Converter UPS .
Lastly , there is an option for the Frequency Converter to clean up a non-stable input frequency .
These type machines can accept a poor frequency range on the input and produce a stable output .
The Dynamic Frequency Regulator is a great solution to produce regulated frequency and voltage .
This unit allows for a very unstable utility , while producing clean electric power to your equipment .
Uninterruptible Power Supply :
An Uninterruptible Power Supply ( UPS ) only has one job .
Keep the equipment power on when the utility power is no longer active .
When a power disturbance occurs , it is critical for the Uninterruptible Power Supply to be in working condition and avoiding an interruption in power .
The uninterruptible power supply will continue to provide electricity to your equipment until Emergency power is available .
PS&C offers Hybrid Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply and Static Uninterruptible Power Supply systems to our customers .
This choice in the type of UPS is not common as almost every other uninterruptible power supply manufacturer only builds one topology , which inherently takes your decision away .
Tactical Enclosures
Our Enclosure and Shelter solutions include SCIF ’s , Modular Office Space , Portable Data Centers , Modular Operations Center , Forced Entry Ballistic Reinforced ( FEBR ) , Hardened Alternate Tactical Shelter ( HATS ) , and custom Tempest & Hemp Structures .
Our enclosures are Portable , Modular , and Tactical solutions .
This allows our products to be inherently expandable systems .
Power Systems & Controls developed our Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility ( SCIF ) for critical customer application and the U.S. Intelligence community , for data protection .
These facilities are protected space used to process Sensitive Compartmented Information ( SCI ) concerning intelligence sources , methods , or analytical processes .
PS&C ’s portable Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities ( SCIF ) are manufactured to the highest standards required by the United States Government .
What makes Power Systems & Controls ( PS&C ) unique is our ability to integrate our power quality systems into our Enclosure and Shelters solutions .
This offers our customers a range of special application high quality products .
With 1000 ’s of machines located worldwide , PS&C is the obvious choice for Power and Shelter products .
Our commitment to quality and our customers ensures we manufacture the highest quality products each and every time .
The effects of a massive volcanic eruption in Peru more than 400 years ago might have significantly impacted societies and agriculture world - wide , according to a new study of historic records .
Huaynaputina erupted in southern Peru on Feb. 19 , 1600 , driving volcanic mudflows that destroyed villages for many miles around and spewing a huge column of smoke and ash into the atmosphere .
The eruption of Huaynaputina represents the largest known eruption in South America in the past 500 years , said study leader Ken Verosub of the University of California , Davis .
Global cooling
Like many other volcanic eruptions , Huaynaputina injected a large amount of sulfur into the atmosphere .
Sulfur reacts with water in the air to form sulfuric acid droplets , which reflect some of the sunlight hitting Earth , preventing rays from reaching the surface .
The reduction in sunlight cools the surface for a year or so , until the droplets fall out of the atmosphere .
The most recent case of this cooling from a volcanic eruption occurred when Mount Pinatubo , in the Philippines , blew its top in 1991 .
Global temperatures dropped by about 1 degree Fahrenheit ( 0.5 degrees Celsius ) the following year .
( Scientists have proposed schemes to artificially inject sulfur into the atmosphere to counteract the effects of global warming . )
Studies of tree rings have shown that 1601 was a cold year ( trees grow less in colder years , so the growth rings corresponding to those years are not as wide ) , but no one had looked through records to see how the eruption impacted societies globally .
" We knew it was a big eruption , we knew it was a cold year , and that 's all we knew , " Verosub said .
Other historic eruptions , such as Indonesia 's Tambora in 1815 , had well - documented effects on global agriculture .
Verosub and undergraduate student Jake Lippmann combed through records from the turn of the 17th century in Europe , China , Japan and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in South America to investigate the eruption 's potential impacts .
Famine , freezes and late harvests
Here is what the geologists found :
In Russia , the period from 1601 to 1603 brought the worst famine in the country 's history , leading to the overthrow of the czar .
Records from Switzerland , Latvia and Estonia mention the exceptionally cold winters from 1600 to 1602 .
The 1601 wine harvest in France was late and wine production collapsed in Germany and colonial Peru .
In China , peach trees bloomed late , while in Japan , Lake Suwa had one of its earliest freezing dates in 500 years .
" In one sense , we can't prove that the volcano was responsible for all this , " Verosub said , " but we hope to show that 1601 was a consistently bad year , connected by this event . "
The findings are detailed in Eos , the weekly newspaper of the American Geophysical Union .
Verosub also plans to examine records kept by the Jesuit order of the Roman Catholic Church in Seville , Spain , and by the Ming Dynasty in China .
Analysis of the soil has surprised and delighted Nasa scientists Martian soil appears to contain sufficient nutrients to support life - or , at least , asparagus - Nasa scientists believe .
Preliminary analysis by the $ 420 m ( £ 210 m ) Phoenix Mars Lander mission on the planet 's soil found it to be much more alkaline than expected .
Scientists working on the spacecraft project said they were " flabbergasted " by the discovery .
The find has raised hopes conditions on Mars may be favourable for life .
" We basically have found what appears to be the requirements , the nutrients , to support life , whether past , present or future , " said Tufts University 's Professor Sam Kounaves .
The researcher is the " wet chemistry " lead on the spacecraft 's Microscopy , Electrochemistry , and Conductivity Analyzer ( Meca ) suite of instruments .
Exciting data
Although he said further tests would have to be conducted , Professor Kounaves said the soil seemed " very friendly there is nothing about it that is toxic " .
We were all flabbergasted at the data we got back
Sam Kounaves , Tufts University
" It is the type of soil you would probably have in your backyard - you know , alkaline .
You might be able to grow asparagus in it really well . "
As well as being far less acidic than anticipated , the soil was also found to contain traces of magnesium , sodium , potassium and other elements .
" We were all flabbergasted at the data we got back , " said Professor Kounaves .
" It is very exciting for us . "
The analysis is based on a cubic centimetre of soil scooped from 2.5 cm ( one inch ) below Mars ' surface by the lander 's robotic arm .
The sample was then tested using a technique that involves mixing the soil with water brought from Earth and heating the sample in one of the lander 's eight ovens .
After a 10 - month flight from Earth , Phoenix touched down successfully on Mars ' northern plains on 25 May .
The Arctic location where Phoenix landed is thought to hold large stores of water - ice just below the surface .
Last week , scientists said they were positive there was ice at the landing location after eight dice - sized chunks were seen to sublimate ( turn straight from solid to vapour ) away in a series of photographs .
Phoenix is undertaking a three - month study of Mars ' geological history

Some examples of “ healthy food ” words on product labels :
Fat Free
Reduced Fat
Low Fat
Sugar Free
No Added Sugar
Diet
We are supposed to believe that each of these categories makes a food healthier .
In reality , this could n’t be further from the truth .
Here is what those “ healthy food ” phrases actually translate to :
Fat free , but full of sugar and chemicals .
Reduced fat , but increased carbohydrates .
Low fat , but high glycemic index .
Sugar free , but artificial everything else .
No added sugar … because the all natural version has enough sugar to give you type II diabetes anyway .
“ Diet ” food , but it causes cancer in lab rats so do n’t drink / eat too much of it .
Consider the logic that food manufactures would have us believe : fat - free is good for you ; jelly beans , jolly ranchers , and cotton candy are fat - free ; therefore all those sugary candies are good for you .
Makes sense ?
Think about it .
In fact , a study at John Hopkins University recently determined a link between high blood sugar and heart disease .
This means high glycemic foods , such as the candy I just mentioned as well as many similar products , are inherently unhealthy .
Let ’s examine some examples of nasty food that is supposed to be healthy , but will secretly kill you faster than the Terminator ( not the Arnold character in any of the sequels ) .
1. Diet Soda
Why is it good ?
A sugar free version of the popular carbonated beverage that you can drink on the go .
Why is it bad ?
OK , so soda is horrible for you , but take out the sugar and add in carcinogenic artificial sweeteners , combined with the artificial flavors and colors that are in all sodas , and you have a recipe for a Tumor in a Can .
Then of course you ’ve got the caffeine factor , which is linked to hyperactivity , high blood pressure , and can mess with your blood sugar .
Unfortunately the caffeine is an oh - so - good afternoon supplement .
Instead choose : filtered water and the occasional glass of milk
2. Sushi made with white rice and imitation crab meat or vegetables
Why is it good ?
Seaweed contains essential nutrients such as selenium , calcium , iodine , and omega - 3 fats .
Sushi is nearly always wrapped in seaweed .
Why is it bad ?
This garbage does n’t deserve to be called sushi .
They are just small , compact , high glycemic , high calorie , carbohydrate nuggets .
There ’s not even much protein in these things .
Eat 3 - 4 of them and you ’ve had your serving for the day .
Aside from that , imitation crab meat is n’t even good for you .
It is mostly just a crab flavored tofu - like substance fortified with sugar , sugar , and more sugar .
It is n’t tofu , it ’s actually a bunch of processed white fish , but it tastes like tofu .
Blah !
Instead choose :
In order to get some healthy carbs , some high - quality protein , and the benefits of omega - 3 fats , choose real sushi made with salmon or tuna .
To make it even healthier , order sashimi instead of white rice .
3. Peanuts
Why is it good ?
Peanuts contain healthy fats that contribute to the reduction in triglycerides , which are known to promote cardiovascular disease .
In addition to monosaturated fatty acids , peanuts also contain magnesium , vitamin E , arginine , fiber , copper and folate all of which help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease .
Why is it bad ?
Aside from being high in fat and calories , peanuts also are loaded with omega - 6 fats that distort the omega - 3 to omega - 6 ratio .
This ratio says that your intake of each omega fatty acid should be 1:1 .
The reasons why this ratio is recommended is a topic for a whole other article .
All we need to know is that the American diet is typically from 20:1 to 50:1 in favor of omega - 6 , so any effort to reverse this trend is important for combating over 10 different common diseases including Alzheimer ’s , rheumatoid arthritis , and diabetes .
Peanuts are often contaminated with a carcinogenic mold called aflatoxin , and they are also one of the most pesticide - contaminated crops .
Instead choose : almonds or all natural organic peanut butter , but pour off the top layer of oil and replace with olive oil if the resulting peanut brick is too stiff .
Olive oil is very low in omega - 6 fats .
( But honestly , if you want the peanuts you should just eat them .
They ’re not that bad for you diet - wise . )
4. Reduced - Fat Peanut Butter
Why is it good ?
All peanut butter provides a heart - healthy substantial quantity of monounsaturated fat .
Why is it bad ?
Most commercial peanut butters are made with the same type of sugar that cake frosting is made with .
Reducing the fat makes it even worse because even MORE nasty sugar is added and they contain less healthy fat .
I ’d rather just eat the extra calories .
Instead choose :
As with peanuts , choose almonds or all natural organic peanut butter instead .
Just remember to pour off the top layer of oil and replace it with olive oil if the resulting peanut brick is too stiff .
Olive oil is very low in omega - 6 fats .
I personally , after switching to all - natural , can no longer stomach commercial peanut butter .
It tastes like sweetened lard to me now so I ’d rather barf than eat it at all .
5. Corn Oil
Why is it good ?
It contains omega - 6 fatty acids , which are unsaturated fats that do n’t raise cholesterol .
Sweet .
Why is it bad ?
In the true spirit of peanuts , corn oil has 60 times more omega - 6s than omega - 3s .
Omega - 6 fatty acids increase inflammation , which boosts your risk of cancer , arthritis , and obesity .
This is why we prefer a balanced ratio of omega - 3s , which are found in walnuts , fish , and flaxseed .
Instead choose : Canola or Olive oils , which have a far better ratio of omega - 6s to omega - 3s .
In my humble opinion , choose olive oil instead since canola oil has some less important issues of its own .
6. Fat -Free or Reduced Fat Salad Dressing
Why is it good ?
Less fat means less calories .
Plus that salad dressing fat is lard just like mayo and crisco .
Sick .
Why is it bad ?
Firstly because when fat comes out , sugar goes in .
Either that or artificial flavors and sweeteners .
Secondly , since many vegetables are fat soluble , taking away the fat from the dressing means fewer of the salad nutrients will be absorbed into your body .
This was confirmed by a study at Ohio State University wherein a higher fat salad dressing resulted in an increased uptake of the antioxidants lutein and beta - carotene .
Instead choose : A salad dressing made with olive oil , or just use olive oil and vinegar as your salad dressing .
If you try it you might like it .
7 . Anything made with Soy Why is it good ?
It ’s not .
But in the spirit of argument : vegetarians and vegans eat the stuff so they can get protein in their diets .
Yay :: sarcasm : :
Plus the stuff is apparently low in fat and an alternative to whey for the lactose intolerant .
Why is it bad ?
Straight up , soy is thought to be linked to increased estrogen in males and increased breast cancer in women .
The estrogenic effects are sometimes said to merely be the presence of the phytoestrogens and estrogen mimicking compounds found in soy .
Because of these estrogenic compounds , infants in particular can be adversely affected in many negative ways from exposure to soy , including premature development in girls , and underdevelopment in boys .
Soy also promotes hypothyroidism , thyroid cancer , and infertility just to name a few additional disorders .
Phytic acid , trypsin inhibitors , toxic lysinoalanine and highly carcinogenic nitrosamines are all highly present in soy products .
Get Some !
Some people are allergic to soy protein .
Instead choose : any high protein whole food such as brown rice , goats milk , coconut milk , almond milk , whole grains , nuts , seaweeds , seeds , beans , and lentils .
If you must have a protein powder , choose any of a variety of protein powders available on the market today , including whey and egg protein .
I use Optimum Nutrition protein powder .
Click here to get some .
As a side note , goats milk is considered one of the healthiest foods on the planet today , so give it a try .
8 . Yogurt cups , especially those with fruit at the bottom
Why is it good ?
Individually , fruit and yogurt are two of the healthiest food choices at the grocery store .
Why is it bad ?
Manufacturers load these products up with corn syrup , which effectively doubles the amount of sugar .
All the better to entice kids to ask you to buy this crap .
Instead choose : Activia yogurt , which contains additional live active cultures to help your digestive system .
Choose the Light version if you wish , but it is sweetened with sucralose ( Splenda ) .
( I opt for the light version . )
I enjoy Splenda quite often , but we have yet to know if there are an significant long term effects from its use .
After all there are a few theories which suggest that consuming sucralose is like consuming very small amounts of chlorinated pesticides .
There are at this time no conclusive tests that sucralose has any long term negative side effects .
9 -11 . Fruit Juice , Dried Fruit , and Fruit Cocktail
Why is it good ?
Well because fruit is good for you .
It has a ton of vitamins , minerals , and antioxidants ; not to mention fiber .
Why is it bad ?
Fruit juice and fruit cocktail normally have sugar added .
Some fruit cocktails come in a thick sugary syrup , and there ’s more sugar in a glass of fruit juice than in a candy bar and as much as in a glass of soda ( grape juice has about 40g of sugar in one serving ) .
You get no fiber from fruit juice , and the stuff usually has preservatives added to it .
Dried fruit is similarly bad because it is also loaded with sugar , although not with added sugar .
Think of it this way : take any fruit , which is naturally loaded with sugar , remove all the moisture thus shrinking it down to a fraction of its normal size , then sell it by the bucket load to consumers who do n’t understand that this little tiny piece of fruit still has nearly all the calories and sugar of the original fruit !
Can anyone say “ portion control ” ?
What about “ blood sugar coma ” ?
Instead choose : eat the whole fruit including the skin if possible , but limit it to one serving of fruit per meal / snack to avoid insulin spikes .
If you must have fruit cocktail , choose one that comes packed in its own juices instead of syrup .
12 . Smartfood ( Cheesy Popcorn ) ( Cheesy Popcorn )
Why is it good ?
Because cheesy popcorn is oh so tasty .
Why is it bad ?
Because you are really just eating the popcorn equivalent of potato chips .
Seriously , compare total calories and you will find that you are not saving much on the calorie front by eating Smartfood instead of chips .
Instead choose : get some spray butter , pop some plain popcorn , spray a light coat of spray butter on the popped corn , sprinkle various spices on the corn ( but go easy on the salts ) , and shake it up in a bag .
Now you have a low fat tasty treat .
Smartfood is n’t as bad as a candy bar or a Twinkie though , so go ahead and splurge every so often .
13 . Beans packed in sugary syrups such as Boston Baked Beans
Why is it good ?
Baked beans are good for you because these types of beans are loaded with fiber
Why is it bad ?
The sugary syrup , just as much as in a can of soda , is just going to spike your blood sugar and insulin levels .
This is never good for preventing heart disease or type II onset diabetes .
Instead choose : Red kidney beans .
These things are packed with protein and fiber , and can be mixed with any sort of salad or pasta .
Sometimes I enjoy kidney beans straight out of the can ; no cooking , just wash and chow .
There are also several other kinds of high protein , high fiber beans , but they typically have to be cooked first .
I say this because I tend to be lazy about cooking and I know you do too .
Try cooking up some nice black beans ; high in protein and fiber , low in everything bad .
14 -20 . Granola , White Pasta , Pasta Salad , English Muffins , Bagels , Croutons , and Pretzels Why is it good ?
Granola has some fiber , pasta salad has some vegetables , croutons make our salad crunchy , english muffins are one step up from bagels , and pretzels are a quick low - fat snack .
Why is it bad ?
One word : carbohydrates .
All of these foods are made with corn syrup and / or processed white flour .
These foods will spike your blood sugar faster than Bruce Lee could have kicked you in the face .
You also wo n’t get much nutrition in the way of protein , fiber , vitamins , or minerals from any of these foods .
Instead choose : 100 % whole grain or whole wheat pasta and English muffins for increased fiber and protein .
Egg salad because , like it or not , eggs are good for you and are high in protein .
Almond slices are high in omega - 3 fats and are crunchy like croutons .
Substitute healthy nuts for white starches whenever you can and you too can receive a 30 % less chance of heart disease .
Clearly there are many alternatives to sneaky consumer foods .
Fruits and vegetables remain a key ingredient in a healthy diet , and now you can look for tricky catch phrases when purchasing ‘ health foods ’ .
Drink plenty of water , get plenty of sleep , and eat wholesome low - sugar , healthy - fat foods ; I bet you will end up doing OK as a result .

Changing Venezuela by Taking Power , by Gregory Wilpert ( Verso , 2007 )
Gregory Wilpert has pulled off a triumph on two fronts with his new book on the Bolivarian Revolution , Changing Venezuela by Taking Power .
Most obviously , Wilpert 's book — in both its scope and ( sometimes almost maddening ) objectivity — is the most detailed and credible analysis yet published of the Venezuelan revolution , which itself represents , arguably , the single most significant challenge today to the hegemony of global capitalism .
But Wilpert has not just produced a comprehensive look at the social , economic and political transformation that has shaken the foundations of Venezuela over the past decade ; he has also delivered a sharp rebuke to one of the trendiest , if dubious , political theories to appear on the academic left in recent years .
Wilpert 's title is an unsubtle blast at John Holloway 's Changing the World Without Taking Power , a book that with its theoretical ambition ( and pretension ) rivals Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's Empire in its attempt to carve out a new radical theoretical manifesto — something that is about the last thing the left needs anyway , but I digress .
Holloway , a British academic who has been amongst the leading chroniclers of the Zapatista movement in the Mexican province of Chiapas -- which announced itself dramatically with an armed uprising on January 1 , 1994 ( the day NAFTA took effect ) -- makes the case that the left should abandon the field of struggle for state power .
In defence of this recommendation , Holloway points to the historic failures of both state socialism (s ) and social democratic attempts to transcend or , in the latter 's case , even reform capitalism in any meaningful or permanent way .
Elevating some of the success of the indigenous resistance in Chiapas to the level of universal prescriptions , Holloway argues that progressive forces should focus only on building autonomous spaces of ``anti- power '' , organising on the local level and slowly developing alternatives in every aspect of life and work in order to eventually overwhelm the alienating and violent capitalist system .
Against this theory of abstention at the level of the state , enter the radical and inspiring example of the Venezuelan experience since 1998 , where the presence of an aggressively left - wing elected government has helped encourage the growth of community organising and popular participation .
Wilpert gives the basic chronology of the process , which has steadily radicalised as it has beaten back right - wing attempts to overthrow it .
Wilpert spends very little time polemicising against Holloway directly .
Instead , he rolls out chapter after chapter spelling out the tremendous scope of change that has taken place since Hugo Chavez was first elected .
Wilpert , for instance , examines in detail changes in governance policy which aim to implement the inclusive , participatory democracy outlined in the 1999 Bolivarian constitution , which was ratified by referendum and has become the ``little blue book '' of the revolution — both studied intensely and carried in pocket - sized form by Chavez 's partisans .
Subsequent chapters analyse economic , social and foreign policy .
One of the most interesting sections looks at one of the least reported developments in Venezuela : the government ’s promotion of the ``social economy '' , which ``encompasses at least five closely interrelated programs : redistribution of wealth ( via land reform programs and social policies ) , promotion of cooperatives , creation of nuclei of endogenous development , industrial co-management , and social production enterprises . ''
In fact , between 1998 and 2005 , the number of cooperatives in Venezuela ' went from under 1000 to more than 100,000 .
Here we have the left , precisely because it has captured state power , able to build alternatives to capitalist hegemony .
To provocatively use Holloway 's term against his argument , " anti-power " in Venezuela can better be built from the bottom - up because the left can promote its spread from the top down .
This contribution alone , and especially Wilpert 's attention to detail , would have been enough to recommend Changing Venezuela By Taking Power .
But Wilpert 's coup de grace is that he also serves up utterly unsentimental criticism where appropriate , and an unromantic assessment of the contradictions , dangers and myriad challenges that the Bolivarian Revolution faces .
In this , Wilpert does not let his intimacy and his engagement with his subject colour his analysis .
A couple of passages illustrate , for instance , a key Bolivarian contradiction , and show that Wilpert eschews the simplistic " revolution from below / from above " dichotomy that marks so much of the sectarian literature on Venezuela .
On the one hand , Wilpert notes the importance of Chavez 's ``ability to bring together a previously very fragmented movement of progressive civilians and military officers ' ' .
This charismatic leadership helped galvanise a movement :
It is thanks to his ability to rally the poor that the poor have broken with their traditional apathy for politics and their pragmatic support for the democratic system of the past …
Their support for democracy is no longer pragmatic , but has become filled with the hope that true democracy can transform the country into a more egalitarian and just one .
But the leader 's dynamism also poses risks to the ultimate achievement of political and economic transformation .
Although Wilpert notes that the government has taken some measures to minimise the cult of personality around Chavez , the problems of " personalism " are substantial .
Wilpert argues :
[ As ] long as Chavez does not clarify the difference between uncritical obedience and absolute loyalty , where the latter allows for constructive critique and the former does not , he gives the impression of being indispensable and unquestionable .
More than that , it is well known in Venezuela that , all too often , die - hard Chavistas will immediately pigeonhole as " escualidos " ( squalids , as Chavistas like to call opposition supporters ) those who are critical of some aspect of Chavez or his government , even if the critic is otherwise a supporter .
The strength of Wilpert 's book is precisely this kind of frank , surgical assessment .
And while the author clearly thinks his subject is important , he does n't generalise from the Bolivarian experience a recipe that others must follow .
Holloway , in contrast , makes the mistake of generalising from the Zapatista experience , of which he is a partisan , sweeping and — in fine post - modern academic form — often semi-indecipherable theoretical conclusions .
Like all people who have organised for radical social change in conservative times , the Venezuelans ( along with the Bolivians and others in Latin America ) have and will face fierce opposition , both domestically and internationally .
The right - wing media outlets in Venezuela itself have been so outrageous — the 2002 coup against Chavez has even been termed the world 's " first media coup " due to the overt participation of the private media giants in the toppling of a democratic government — they have caused their readership and credibility to plummet .
The prevalent smear jobs and caricatures of Chavez 's term in office in the international press have , unfortunately , been considerably more effective .
As publisher of venezuelanalysis.com — by far the best aggregator of English - language news and analysis about politics in Venezuela — Wilpert has been steadily working to expose and counter this misinformation campaign .
His book compiles much of this material , while organising and presenting it in an accessible way .
In Venezuela , the past decade has seen the shattering of the myth of " the end of history " and its demoralising corollary , " there is no alternative ' ' .
Today , the alternative (s ) to capitalism remains to be found and built , and it is of course up against innumerable obstacles , attacks , false starts and errors .
But the Bolivarian Revolution has reminded us all that beyond just being a soothing slogan , it is indeed possible to fight for another , better world .
As Wilpert puts it : " Venezuela is recuperating the utopian energies , which became exhausted with the failures of state socialism , of social democracy , and of neo-liberal capitalism , merely by trying a different and as yet relatively unexplored path . "
On that vital but difficult path to a world beyond neoliberalism , I can't help but wish that there were more public intellectuals like Gregory Wilpert , seriously engaged with processes of social change and serious about communicating in broadly accessible language .
Changing Venezuela by Taking Power is a valuable addition to the bookshelves of all those who are trying to make sense of , and change for the better , our unequal world .
New paragraphs 7 - 8 make clear U.S. Congress passed law in 1995 that said Jerusalem was capital of Israel and U.S. embassy should move there .
But successive presidents , who set foreign policy , have refused to move embassy and U.S. diplomats say U.S. policy is aligned with other major powers in viewing status of Jerusalem as under negotiation between Israel and Palestinians .
RAMALLAH , West Bank , June 4 ( Reuters ) - Palestinian leaders reacted with anger and dismay on Wednesday to Barack Obama 's pledge that Jerusalem should be Israel 's undivided capital .
President Mahmoud Abbas rejected the U.S. presidential candidate 's pledge to American Jewish leaders and he repeated his demand for a Palestinian state with Arab East Jerusalem as its capital .
" This statement is totally rejected , " Abbas told reporters in the West Bank administrative centre of Ramallah .
" The whole world knows that East Jerusalem , holy Jerusalem , was occupied in 1967 and we will not accept a Palestinian state without having Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state . "
Abbas aide Saeb Erekat said Palestinian negotiators engaged in U.S. - sponsored peace talks would continue to insist on securing East Jerusalem , captured by Israel in 1967 , as their capital .
He said of Obama : " He has closed all doors to peace . "
Obama , newly secure as the Democratic nominee for president , said in a speech in Washington : " Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel , and it must remain undivided . "
The U.S. Congress passed a law in 1995 describing Jerusalem as capital of Israel and saying it should not be divided , but successive presidents have used their foreign policy powers to maintain the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv and to back negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on the status of Jerusalem .
U.S. diplomats say that , despite the U.S. legislation , Washington 's foreign policy is in practice broadly aligned with that of the United Nations and other major powers , which do not view Jerusalem as Israel 's capital and do not recognise Israel 's annexation of Arab East Jerusalem following the 1967 war .
The outgoing U.S. president , George W. Bush , has sponsored peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in the hope of securing a deal on a Palestinian state before he leaves office in January .
One of the thorniest issues is resolving the rival Israel and Palestinian demands on the future of Jerusalem .
DISAPPOINTED
Erekat , a Palestinian peace negotiator , said Abbas 's administration was dismayed by Obama 's endorsement of the Israeli claim : " We are very disappointed ...
He has failed to understand that without East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state there wo n't be peace with Israel . "
Bush , whose Republican party has endorsed John McCain as its candidate , also disappointed many Palestinians during a visit to Israel last month .
In strong terms , he assured the Jewish state of enduring U.S. support -- though he did not endorse Israel 's demand to retain control of all Jerusalem as its capital .
In the Gaza Strip , where Abbas 's Islamist rivals in the Hamas movement seized power a year ago , a Hamas spokesman also condemned Obama 's stance on Jerusalem : " Obama 's comments have confirmed there will be no change in the U.S. administration 's policy on the Arab - Israeli conflict , " Sami Abu Zuhri said .
" Hamas does not differentiate between the two presidential candidates , Obama and ( Republican John ) McCain , because their policies regarding the Arab - Israeli conflict are the same and are hostile to us . "
Several polls signal that Mr. Obama ’s troubles have shaken the confidence in the Democratic electorate , and it is too early to measure fully how much he may have been hurt by a round of incendiary appearances by his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr .
A big Clinton victory in Indiana on Tuesday and in West Virginia the next week could , combined with her victories in Pennsylvania and Ohio , give her ammunition to say that Mr. Obama would fail to draw blue - collar support against Mr. McCain in the fall .
David Plouffe , the manager of Mr. Obama ’s campaign , said that if Mrs. Clinton won 55 percent of the remaining pledged delegates  an assumption he called “ overly generous ”  she would still need about two - thirds of the remaining uncommitted superdelegates to reach the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the nomination .
Mrs. Clinton ’s advisers did not dispute Mr. Plouffe ’s calculation , in effect acknowledging the enormousness of their task .
Senator Christopher J. Dodd , the Connecticut Democrat who ran for president and has now endorsed Mr. Obama , said that Mrs. Clinton still had a chance but that it was something of a long shot .
“ I still do n’t think the math is there , ” Mr. Dodd said .
Most of what chance Mrs. Clinton has rests on her ability to convince superdelegates that Mr. Obama would be a flawed candidate in the general election .
In recent weeks , he has certainly struggled with a series of problems  some of his own making  which has made it easier for her to make that case .
Many superdelegates said they were queasy about Mr. Obama and his former pastor , and fearful of how the issue might be used in the fall .
Still , they said they were not convinced that that made him a weaker general - election candidate than Mrs. Clinton , or at least not convinced enough to cast a vote that could be portrayed as overturning the will of Democratic primary voters and blocking the effort by Mr. Obama to become the nation ’s first African - American president .

The debate over fragmentation of blog comments has been around for awhile —
I ’ve written about it , and so have people like Louis Gray and MG Siegler and others — and I do n’t think it ’s going away any time soon .
Some argue that having comments at places like FriendFeed ( or Shyftr , or a number of other sites ) is n’t really that big a deal , and that it ’s no different than people discussing your blog post via email or some other place that you ca n’t see it .
But Fred Wilson had an interesting take on it in one of his blog posts today , about a blog post by his brother Jackson : he said as far as he ’s concerned , bloggers effectively get “ paid ” by people commenting on their posts :
So here ’s the deal .
Jackson instigated the conversation with that post .
His reward is the comments it generates .
That ’s how bloggers get paid .
And he ’s not getting his due on this one .
I think that ’s an interesting way of looking at it .
Obviously , comments do n’t actually pay bloggers for their posts ( although the tip - jar model is pretty close ) .
And I ’m sure some bloggers would rather get paid with actual money .
But I still think Fred is onto something — comments , and other interaction with readers , are one of the ways in which bloggers are rewarded for their effort , along with links from other bloggers , high ranking on sites like Techmeme , etc .
It would be nice to think that the sheer joy of crafting an awesome blog post was enough , but some feedback is nice too , even if it ’s not completely positive .
( Note : For what it ’s worth , I agree with Jackson — Mott the Hoople was awesome ) .
That ’s why , like Fred , I am hopeful that comments in all kinds of places can be aggregated in more ways .
I ’ve got Disqus on my blog ( as Fred does ) and that helps — and now I have the FriendFeed plugin working as well , so any comments that appear there show up here as well .
I do n’t mind people commenting somewhere else , but I like the idea that I ( or anyone else ) can see them all in one place if I want to do that .
Steven Hodson thinks WordPress should buy Disqus , and Broadstuff has some thoughts too about what he calls “ dis- aggregating the aggregators . ”
Allen Stern of Centernetworks has a video response .
And Hutch Carpenter of I ’m Not Actually a Geek thinks that fragmented conversations can actually be a good thing .

The election may be close now , but the historical precedents do n’t look good for the Republican .
Historians see little chance for McCain
One week into the general election , the polls show a dead heat .
But many presidential scholars doubt that John McCain stands much of a chance , if any .
Historians belonging to both parties offered a litany of historical comparisons that give little hope to the Republican .
Several saw Barack Obama ’s prospects as the most promising for a Democrat since Roosevelt trounced Hoover in 1932 .

“ This should be an overwhelming Democratic victory , ” said Allan Lichtman , an American University presidential historian who ran in a Maryland Democratic senatorial primary in 2006 .
Lichtman , whose forecasting model has correctly predicted the last six presidential popular vote winners , predicts that this year , “ Republicans face what have always been insurmountable historical odds . ”
His system gives McCain a score on par with Jimmy Carter ’s in 1980 .
“ McCain should n’t win it , ” said presidential historian Joan Hoff , a professor at Montana State University and former president of the Center for the Study of the Presidency .
She compared McCain ’s prospects to those of Hubert Humphrey , whose 1968 loss to Richard Nixon resulted in large part from the unpopularity of sitting Democratic president Lyndon Johnson .
“ It is one of the worst political environments for the party in power since World War II , ” added Alan Abramowitz , a professor of public opinion and the presidency at Emory University .
His forecasting model — which factors in gross domestic product , whether a party has completed two terms in the White House and net presidential approval rating — gives McCain about the same odds as Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and Carter in 1980 — both of whom were handily defeated in elections that returned the presidency to the previously out - of - power party .
“ It would be a pretty stunning upset if McCain won , ” Abramowitz said .
What ’s more , Republicans have held the presidency for all but 12 years since the South became solidly Republican in the realignment of 1968 — which is among the longest runs with one party dominating in American history .
“ These things go in cycles , ” said presidential historian Robert Dallek , a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles .
“ The public gets tired of one approach to politics .
There is always a measure of optimism in this country , so they turn to the other party . ”
That desire for change also tends to manifest itself at the end of a president ’s second term .
Only twice in the 20th century has a candidate from the same party as a two - term president won the presidency , most recently in 1988 , when George H.W. Bush replaced the term - limited Ronald Reagan , who was about twice as popular in the last year of his presidency as President George W. Bush is now .
But the biggest obstacle in McCain ’s path may be running in the same party as the most unpopular president America has had since at least the advent of modern polling .
Only Harry Truman and Nixon — both of whom were dogged by unpopular wars abroad and political scandals at home — have been nearly as unpopular in their last year in office , and both men ’s parties lost the presidency in the following election .
Though the Democratic - controlled Congress is nearly as unpopular as the president , Lichtman says the Democrats ’ 2006 midterm wins resemble the midterm congressional gains of the out - party in 1966 and 1974 , which both preceded a retaking of the White House two years later .
One of the few bright spots historians noted is that the public generally does not view McCain as a traditional Republican .
And , as Republicans frequently point out , McCain is not an incumbent .
“ Open - seat elections are somewhat different , so the referendum aspect is somewhat muted , ” said James Campbell , a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo who specializes in campaigns and elections .
“ McCain would be in much better shape if Bush ’s approval rating were at 45 to 50 percent , ” Campbell continued .
“ But the history is that in - party candidates are not penalized or rewarded to the same degree as incumbents . ”
Campbell still casts McCain as the underdog .
But he said McCain might have more appeal to moderates than Obama if the electorate decides McCain is “ center right ” while Obama is “ far left . ”
Democrats have been repeatedly undone when their nominee was viewed as too liberal , and even as polls show a rise in the number of self - identified Democrats , there has been no corresponding increase in the number of self - identified liberals .
Campbell also notes that McCain may benefit from the Democratic divisions that were on display in the primary , as Republicans did in 1968 , when Democratic divisions over the war in Vietnam dogged Humphrey and helped hand Nixon victory .
Still , many historians remain extremely skeptical about McCain ’s prospects .
“ I ca n’t think of an upset where the underdog faced quite the odds that McCain faces in this election , ” said Sidney Milkis , a professor of presidential politics at the University of Virginia .
Even " Truman did n’t face as difficult a political context as McCain . ”
Despite being ensnared in legal proceedings with the MPAA , isoHunt is continuing to grow .
Adding fuel to the ' significant non-infringing use ' argument is their latest partnership , with the Creative Commons music distribution site Jamendo .
When BitTorrent sites have come under attack by media groups and their battalions of lawyers , it ’s usual for them to pull up the drawbridge and keep the site going as is , and try to get the case over with as soon as possible .
The other option is to close down and hunt for a settlement , but is oHunt , like its other big - site brethren , has n’t .
Despite a legal campaign that ’s now over two years old , it continues to grow and add features and functionality .
One of these new developments has been the addition of increasing numbers of Creative Commons ( CC ) licensed material .
Creative Commons media is licensed by the creator , to be shared – usually with some restrictions – and is the same license used by TorrentFreak .
It ’s not a niche license , instead it is becoming increasingly popular , with Nine Inch Nails having released their Ghosts album under a CC license earlier this year .
With this is mind , isoHunt has announced a partnership with Jamendo , a site that deals in Creative Commons licensed music .
Reaching the 10,000 album milestone only days ago , content available on Jamendo is growing quickly and when you grow , it helps to be able to get the content out there .
This is why isoHunt decided to partner with several BitTorrent sites .
is oHunt ’s owner , Gary Fung , has been a long time supporter of Creative Commons and public domain works , and has stated that there is a strong future in Creative Commons material at isoHunt .
Laurent Kratz , CEO of Jamendo told TorrentFreak “ Jamendo uses the Creative Commons licensing scheme to keep the rules very straight forward : copy as much as you can eat , the artist , the right - holders are ok .
The new thing about partnering with a torrent portal like is oHunt , is that Jamendo has started an editorial work on top . ”
“ We receive up to 500 new albums per week , from more than 60 countries in the world , ” Kratz said .
“ In order to maximize the interest of millions using torrent search engines every day , it was critical to only highlight a subset of all the albums we receive every day .
It ’s not about discriminating one band from another , it ’s about getting anonymous BitTorrent fans to Jamendo , and discovering unsigned bands from everywhere in the world . ”
Jamendo is also partnering with SumoTorrent , and torrent . to , and has been experimenting with mininova .
In addition , their torrents are also available through Vuze .
What better way to “ stick it to the ** AA ” as so many of our commenters put it , than to ignore their memberships product , and use sites like this instead .

Source : USA TODAY research Pentagon launches foreign news websites WASHINGTON 
The Pentagon is setting up a global network of foreign - language news websites , including an Arabic site for Iraqis , and hiring local journalists to write current events stories and other content that promote U.S. interests and counter insurgent messages .
The news sites are part of a Pentagon initiative to expand " Information Operations " on the Internet .
Neither the initiative nor the Iraqi site , www.Mawtani.com, has been disclosed publicly .
At first glance , Mawtani.com looks like a conventional news website .
Only the " about " link at the bottom of the site takes readers to a page that discloses the Pentagon sponsorship .
The site , which has operated since October , is modeled on two long - established Pentagon - sponsored sites that offer native - language news for people in the Balkans and North Africa .
Journalism groups say the sites are deceptive and easily could be mistaken for independent news .
" This is about trying to control the message , either by bypassing the media or putting your version of the message out before others ( and ) … there 's a heavy responsibility to let people know where you 're coming from , " says Amy Mitchell , deputy director at the Project for Excellence in Journalism .
A disclosure on a separate page " is n't something most people coming to the site are likely to see . "
Pentagon officials say the sites are a legitimate and necessary way to promote U.S. policy goals and counter the messages of political and religious extremists .
They also note that the United States and its allies have been outgunned in the battle to get information to audiences in Iraq and elsewhere .
" It 's important to … engage these foreign audiences and inform , " says Michael Vickers , the assistant secretary of Defense in charge of special operations and stabilization efforts .
" Our adversaries use the Internet to great advantage , so we have the responsibility of countering ( their messages ) with accurate , truthful information , and these websites are a good vehicle . "
The Mawtani site is named for the Iraqi national anthem and means " my homeland . "
It is available in Arabic , Farsi and Urdu — but not in English — and is supervised by the Pentagon 's Iraq command .
The U.S. Southern Command is building a similar site for Latin American audiences .
The Pacific Command , which covers Asia , is interested in setting up a news site , says Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Amy Derrick - Frost , a spokeswoman .
' True in fact and intent '
In a memo last summer , Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England told all regional commanders that developing such sites was " an essential part of ( their ) responsibility … to shape the security environment in their respective areas . "
The previously unreleased memo , provided by the Pentagon at USA TODAY 's request , directed that all site content be " accurate and true in fact and intent . "
Content for the news sites is written by local journalists hired to write stories that fit the Pentagon 's goals for the sites , such as promoting democracy , security , good government and the rule of law .
Military personnel or contractors review the stories to ensure they are consistent with those goals .
Reporters are paid only for work that is posted to the sites .
A recent edition of Mawtani.com featured a story on Iraqi leaders decrying Iranian sponsorship of insurgent groups , as well as coverage of Iraqi - U.S. efforts to restore order in strife - torn Sadr City .
Vickers says sponsorship disclosures on Mawtani.com and other Pentagon - run news sites are clear .
" Is this propaganda ?
No , " he says .
" It 's intended to counter extremist propaganda … with truth . "
The new websites follow the Pentagon 's launch last year of a " Trans Regional Web Initiative " expected to lead to " a minimum of six " news sites run by military commands around the globe , according to a Special Operations Command notice for contractors interested in running the sites .
The initiative has its roots in the Balkans , where U.S. commanders set up a website in 1999 to rebut then - Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milosevic 's nationalist rhetoric in the Kosovo conflict .
In 2002 , it became a news site , employing local reporters , and hundreds of thousands of people turn to the Southeast European Times for news on politics , culture , sports or weather in 10 languages .
Neither that site nor those being set up are allowed to accept ads .
They 're not about profit ; they 're about shaping perceptions .
" Youngsters on the street are into the World Wide Web — that 's how they communicate , how they learn what 's going on in the world , how they stay informed — and they pick and choose what ( news sources ) they have on their desktop , " says Army Col.
Jerry O'Hara , spokesman for the Pentagon 's Iraq command .
" We have to be involved in that in order to communicate effectively . "
Moving past leaflets
It was n't long ago that the military 's approach to Information Operations focused largely on dropping leaflets behind enemy lines or broadcasting messages over loudspeakers .
Those tactics can't draw the audience of a news website , where a story on a local soccer team might be the hook that gets readers to click on another story about , say , U.S. troops rebuilding a school .
The success of the Pentagon 's news sites will ride on whether they 're seen as credible outlets or propaganda vehicles , says Franklin Kramer , a former assistant Defense secretary and , until last year , a fellow at National Defense University .
" In some parts of the world , it 's just important to have a reliable , steady source of news … and being straightforward and truthful is the best way to have a long - term impact , " Kramer says .
" I think most ( users ) know these are Defense Department sites — they really do n't hide it at all — and the audience is going to decide for itself whether it trusts the source . "
For decades , influencing foreign audiences has been the purview of Voice of America , the U.S. radio and TV service .
VOA is under the Broadcasting Board of Governors , an eight - member , presidentially appointed board that oversees all U.S. foreign - language broadcasts , including Radio Sawa and Al Hurra television in the Middle East .
Previous Pentagon information efforts have attracted controversy .
In 2005 , members of Congress chastised the Pentagon over a program that paid for the placement of favorable stories in the Iraqi press .
The practice could " erode the independence of Iraqi media , " said Sen. John Warner , R - Va. , who then chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee .
The Pentagon stopped the program .
Last month , The New York Times reported how the Pentagon was giving secret briefings and guidance to former Defense officials who are paid by television news outlets for independent analysis .
Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , has asked for a Pentagon investigation .
The websites suggest a pattern of Pentagon efforts to promote its agenda by disseminating information through what appear to be independent outlets , says Marvin Kalb , a fellow at Harvard University 's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy .
" This is deliberate deception , and it 's bad … ( because ) it weakens the image of journalism as an objective bystander , " Kalb says , noting that many of the Pentagon 's intended audiences live in a world where they expect the government to control their news .
" We 're the exception , and unfortunately , we begin to look more and more like the rest of the world when we do this sort of thing . "

Mozilla 's Firefox 3 release event yesterday was an epic success .
The servers logged over 8 million downloads during the 24 - hour download day , and Mozilla has declared victory after exceeding its initial goal of 5 million downloads .
I was at the official launch party at Mozilla headquarters yesterday in Mountain View , where some revelers stayed all night to party and watch the download counter .
During the event , Mozilla chairwoman Mitchell Baker 's speech was broadcast live from Seoul , Korea over the Internet to all of Mozilla 's offices .
She reflected on the success of Firefox 3 and illuminated some of Mozilla 's long - term goals .
" Today reflects so many great things about Mozilla , " she said .
The download day is the collaborative achievement of " millions of people on a global basis doing things that everyone thought was impossible . "
Mozilla is all about " keeping and building an Internet that is open and participatory , where individuals have control . "
During the interview , she answered several questions from members of the Firefox community who were participating via an IRC channel .
When she was asked what percentage of browser market share Mozilla aims to achieve , she said that Mozilla wants only enough to be able to achieve the organization 's primary goal , which is building an open web .
" We want enough market share to be able to move the Internet toward our goals .
There is no exact number , " she said .
" It is not our goal to be a single source that unilaterally determines where the web goes .
Mozilla is about having fun and building a better Internet . "
A big part of Firefox 's success is its spirited grassroots marketing efforts .
I discussed this with Mozilla evangelist Asa Dotzler .
Mozilla 's strategy of inclusiveness and participatory advancement is n't confined to just software development .
The same principles extend to Mozilla 's publicity projects .
The grassroots marketing campaigns give users who lack programming expertise a way to become active participants and contributors .
Through the SpreadFirefox portal , those users can become an important part of the Firefox project .
Grassroots marketing is also a major win , said Dotzler , because word of mouth is one of the strongest vehicles for directly promoting Firefox adoption .
I also asked Dotzler some questions about the process through which Mozilla 's download day statistics will enter the Guinness World Records .
The server logs and download information will be given to an independent review board consisting of Corey Shields and Paul Vixie , which will then conduct a thorough audit , weed out duplicate and incomplete downloads , and determine an exact number .
The download day event , which was orchestrated by Mozilla 's global marketing team , has been one of Mozilla 's most successful awareness campaigns to date .
The first 24 hours are over , but the downloads continue to pour in .
At press time , the official counter shows that the current rate is approximately 5,500 downloads per minute , and the total number of downloads is roughly 8.8 million .
It 's further confirmation that the Firefox web browser is rapidly becoming mainstream ; it has long since ceased being a niche product confined to early adopters and enthusiasts .
Firefox has had a profound impact on the web and will likely continue to play a central role in shaping the future of the Internet .
__ The Amish are famous for shunning technology .
But their secret love affair with the cell phone is causing an uproar .
__
Technology is my native tongue .
I 'm online six hours a day .
I have a cell phone , voicemail , fax , laptop , and palmtop .
I 'm connected - and lately , I 've been wondering where all this equipment is leading me .
I 've found myself asking a question that 's both disquieting and intriguing :
What kind of person am I becoming as a result of all this stuff ?
Of course , I 'm not the only one asking .
And a while ago it occurred to me that , in addition to measuring my reactions against those of others in comparable circumstances , I might learn something entirely new by looking at a civilization of which I am not a member .
The Amish communities of Pennsylvania , despite the retro image of horse - drawn buggies and straw hats , have long been engaged in a productive debate about the consequences of technology .
So I turned to them for a glimpse of the future .
Amish settlements have become a cliché for refusing technology .
Tens of thousands of people wear identical , plain , homemade clothing , cultivate their rich fields with horse - drawn machinery , and live in houses lacking that basic modern spirit called electricity .
But the Amish do use such 20th - century consumer technologies as disposable diapers , in - line skates , and gas barbecue grills .
Some might call this combination paradoxical , even contradictory .
But it could also be called sophisticated , because the Amish have an elaborate system by which they evaluate the tools they use ; their tentative , at times reluctant use of technology is more complex than a simple rejection or a whole - hearted embrace .
What if modern Americans could possibly agree upon criteria for acceptance , as the Amish have ?
Might we find better ways to wield technological power , other than simply unleashing it and seeing what happens ?
What can we learn from a culture that habitually negotiates the rules for new tools ?
Last summer , armed with these questions and in the company of an acquaintance with Amish contacts , I traveled around the countryside of Lancaster County , Pennsylvania .
Everywhere , there were freshly planted fields , farmhouses with handsome , immaculate barns and outbuildings .
At one farm we passed , a woman was sitting a hundred yards from her house on the edge of a kitchen garden .
She wore the traditional garb of the conservative Old Order - a long , unadorned dress sheathed by an apron , her hair covered by a prayer bonnet .
She was sitting in the middle of the garden , alone , the very image of technology - free simplicity .
But she was holding her hand up to her ear .
She appeared to be intent on something , strangely engaged .
" Whenever you see an Amish woman sitting in the field like that , " my guide said , " she 's probably talking on a cell phone . "
" It 's a controversy in the making , " he continued .
A rather large one , it turns out - yet part of the continuum of determining whether a particular technology belongs in Amish life .
They 've adopted horses , kerosene lamps , and propane refrigerators ; should they add cell phones ?
Collective negotiations over the use of telephones have ignited intense controversies in the Amish community since the beginning of the 20th century .
In fact , a dispute over the role of the phone was the principal issue behind the 1920s division of the Amish church , wherein one - fifth of the membership broke away to form their own church .
Eventually , certain Amish communities accepted the telephone for its aid in summoning doctors and veterinarians , and in calling suppliers .
But even these Amish did not allow the telephone into the home .
Rather , they required that phones be used communally .
Typically , a neighborhood of two or three extended families shares a telephone housed in a wooden shanty , located either at the intersection of several fields or at the end of a common lane .
These structures look like small bus shelters or privies ; indeed , some phones are in outhouses .
Sometimes the telephone shanties have answering machines in them .
( After all , who wants to wait in the privy on the off chance someone will call ? )
The first Amish person I contacted , I reached by answering machine .
He was a woodworker who , unlike some of his brethren , occasionally talked to outsiders .
I left a message on his phone , which I later learned was located in a shanty in his neighbor 's pasture .
The next day the man , whom I 'll call Amos , returned my call .
We agreed to meet at his farmstead a few days later .
I could n't help thinking it was awfully complicated to have a phone you used only for calling back - from a booth in a meadow .
Why not make life easier and just put one in the house ?
" What would that lead to ? " another Amish man asked me .
" We do n't want to be the kind of people who will interrupt a conversation at home to answer a telephone .
It 's not just how you use the technology that concerns us .
We 're also concerned about what kind of person you become when you use it . "
__ Far from knee - jerk technophobes , these are very adaptive techno - selectives who devise remarkable technologies that fit within their self - imposed limits .

The Amish are famously shy .
Their commitment to " plain " living is most obvious in their unadorned clothing - Old Order Amish even eschew buttons , requiring humble hooks instead .
Any sign of individuality is cause for concern .
Until fairly recently , Amish teachers would reprimand the student who raised his or her hand as being too individualistic .
Calling attention to oneself , or being " prideful , " is one of the cardinal Amish worries .
Having your name or photo in the papers , even talking to the press , is almost a sin .
Like most modern Americans , I assume individuality is not only a fundamental value , but a goal in life , an art form .
The garish technicolor shirts and hand - painted shoes I usually wear sometimes startle business audiences who show up for my speaking engagements .
My reasoning :
If I think for myself , why not dress for myself ?
Dye technology has given us all these colors , so let 's use 'em !
Still , I did n't want to make my idiosyncrasies the focus of my visit to Amish country .
So I bought a plain blue work shirt , dark blue gabardine pants , and brown shoes .
I had n't traveled so drably in many years .
Amos runs a factory of sorts in the vicinity of three memorably named Pennsylvania towns : Bird - in - Hand , Paradise , and Intercourse .
The sun was setting as I drove slowly down his unpaved driveway .
I found myself inside a tableau that must have looked almost exactly the same 200 years ago .
Several men and young boys in identical black trousers , suspenders , and straw hats were operating horse - drawn equipment in the fields beyond .
One of Amos 's grandsons pointed me to a plain wooden building beside the barn .
The aroma of cows gave way to the pungent smell of diesel fuel and wood chips as I entered the workshop .
The whine of a wood - milling machine made it futile to talk .
This was not the serene place the words " Amish woodshop " conjure up .
My host finished cutting a 12 - foot - long plank before we greeted each other .
He then lit a kerosene lamp in the small office next to his workshop and invited me in .
The office had no modern technology in it , but railroad posters were tacked on the walls , and wooden locomotive models sat on the shelves .
Amos had sawdust and hydraulic fluid in his beard .
His blue - gray eyes fastened on me as he bounced back his own questions in reply to my queries .
He had received the same eighth - grade education that all Amish youth are given , but it was obvious that Amos did some outside reading .
When I asked him to describe his sense of community , he started out , " Hmm , how do you pronounce s - c - e - n - a - r - i-o ? "
Amos runs a successful business crafting wooden furniture , which he sells throughout Pennsylvania and beyond - primarily to the " English " ( the Amish term for non-Amish ) .
It 's a trade more and more Amish are getting into .
Inside Amos 's home there are no telephones , radios , televisions , vacuum cleaners , dishwashers , or other electrical appliances .
In his shop , routers , mills , and sanders are powered by specially adapted hydraulic mechanisms connected to a diesel engine located near a large open door , exhausting outside the building .
This was a good case study in Amish reasoning :
Far from knee - jerk technophobes , these are very adaptive techno - selectives who devise remarkable technologies that fit within their self - imposed limits .
The price of good farmland and the number of Amish families are both increasing so rapidly that in recent decades they have adopted nonagricultural enterprises for livelihood - woodworking , construction , light factory work .
This , in turn , has forced the Amish to adopt technologies that can enhance their productivity .
And the interface with the English brings its own set of demands :
When the State of Pennsylvania refused to certify Amish - produced milk unless it was stirred mechanically and refrigerated according to state health codes , the Amish installed stirring machines and refrigeration - operated by batteries or propane gas .
Amos , like many other Amish craftsmen , uses electricity in his workshop for certain tools .
But the electricity does not come from public utility lines .
Amos runs a diesel generator to charge a bank of 12 - volt batteries .
The batteries ' DC charge is then sent through a converter to create homegrown 110 - volt " Amish electricity . "
To generate more , he has to haul the diesel fuel in from town on his horse - drawn buggy .
To the obvious question why allow Amish electricity but not public electricity , Amos answered slowly and deliberately , " The Bible teaches us not to conform to the world , to keep a separation .
Connecting to the electric lines would make too many things too easy .
Pretty soon , people would start plugging in radios and televisions , and that 's like a hot line to the modern world .
We use batteries and generators because you can use the batteries for only a short time and because you have to fuel and maintain the generator yourself .
It 's a way of controlling our use of electricity .
We try to restrict things that would lead to us losing that sense of being separate , to put the brakes on how fast we change . "
__ " Does it bring us together , or draw us apart ? " is the question bishops ask in considering whether to permit or put away a technology .

Despite the reputation today 's Amish have as old - fashioned diehards , their departure from Europe several centuries ago was driven by their success as innovators .
They started out as radical religious libertarians - at a time when the price of religious radicalism was martyrdom .
Catholics and Protestants were killing each other in a major religious war , but both sides took a serious dislike to these defiant theological purists , known at the time as Anabaptists , for their emphasis on adult baptism .
( Today , every Amish household has a copy of Martyrs ' Mirror , a text of more than 1,000 pages that details the excruciating and humiliating public executions suffered by Anabaptist martyrs in Switzerland , Germany , and Holland . )
The Anabaptists developed a soil technology based on crop rotation , planting clover in their pastures , and sweetening their earth with lime and gypsum ; they dramatically increased the yield of their land , and some of them became wealthy .
Ironically , those same Anabaptists helped set the stage for the fast - paced changes of modern life that today 's Amish reject .
It was the widespread adoption of Anabaptist practices that eventually produced enough food to free other agricultural laborers , creating the workforce that would be needed for the industrial revolution .
Toward the end of the 17th century , one of the Anabaptist leaders , Jakob Ammann , decided that his Swiss brethren had not been radical enough .
Ammann and his followers , who came to be known as " Amish , " broke with traditional Anabaptists , moved to the New World , and started farming in Lancaster County in 1710 .
In today 's Pennsylvania Amish country , a group of 20 to 30 families who live near one another constitute a " district . "
Each district has a bishop , and the bishops get together twice a year to discuss church matters .
This includes raising the recurring questions about which technologies should be permitted in the community , and which banned or regulated .
While the say of the bishops is binding , the Amish come to their decisions quite consensually .
New things are not outright forbidden , nor is there a rush to judgment .
Rather , technologies filter in when one of the more daring members of the community starts to use , or even purchases , something new .
Then others try it .
Then reports circulate about the results .
What happens with daily use ?
Does it bring people together ?
Or have the opposite effect ?
Despite the almost organic ebb and flow of this evaluation process , the common goal is constant submission to the judgment of one 's peers .
On my visit , I was constantly struck by what seemed an alien conception of community .
As a kid I was encouraged to " do my thing " while being nice to others ; I 've lived in five states and dozens of neighborhoods .
Amish communities are not just tightly knit and immobile , they 're authoritarian .
Yet there is some room for disagreement ; consider how the bishops judged the automobile in the 1960s .
Typically , the Amish have large extended families ; most have dozens of cousins within walking or buggy distance .
Every other Sunday , instead of attending church , the Amish are encouraged to visit relatives and the sick .
Over time , it was felt that the automobile was enlarging people 's traveling radius too far beyond their extended family , to diversions and recreations not related to the community , decreasing the social cohesion and personal connection the Amish so cherish .
Some bishops accepted the use of the automobile under certain conditions , while others rejected it outright .
The Amish are now split into traditional " Old Order " Amish who still stick to horse and buggy , " New Order " Amish who approve use of telephones and powered farm equipment but shun public electricity , and " Beachy Amish , " named for the ' 20s liberal leader Moses Beachy , who permit both public electricity and automobiles .
While all orders now allow diesel engines in the barn to blow silage , their use is still resisted in the fields - the bishops do n't want increased efficiency to interfere with the practice of fathers and sons , mothers and daughters , working together with horse - drawn machinery and handheld implements .
Notably , some Old Order Amish allow some diesel - powered equipment in the fields - if it 's hauled by animals .
" Does it bring us together , or draw us apart ? " is the primary question the bishops ask in considering whether to permit or put away a technology .
The bishops ' rulings can take decades .
In daily life , the Amish take their directions in dress , thought , behavior , and custom from a body of unwritten but detailed rules known as the " Ordnung . "
Individuals and communities maintain a separation from the world ( by not connecting their houses to telephones or electricity ) , a closeness to one another ( through regular meetings ) , and an attitude of humility so specific they have a name for it ( " Gelassenheit " ) .
Decisions about technology hinge on these collective criteria .
If a telephone in the home interferes with face - to - face visiting , or an electrical hookup fosters unthinking dependence on the outside world , or a new pickup truck in the driveway elevates one person above his neighbors , then people start to talk about it .
The talk reaches the bishops ' ears .
In the middle of Amish country , it occurs to me that Internet culture itself grew out of a kind of virtual Ordnung - the norms of cooperation , information - sharing , and netiquette taught to newbies by the first generations of users .
The celebrated " anarchy " of the early days was possible only because of the near - universal adherence to largely unwritten rules .
But the Internet population has grown fast - so fast that the sudden influx of tens of millions of newbies has overwhelmed the capacity of the old - timers to pass on the Ordnung .
In the process , the Internet loses its unique hallmarks , coming to resemble and reflect the rest of contemporary culture .
__ " Instead of a telephone shanty , some Old Order Amish leave their cell phone overnight with an English neighbor , who recharges it . "
__
" The Amish employ an intuitive sense about what will build solidarity and what will pull them apart , " says Donald Kraybill , author of The Riddle of Amish Culture .
" You find state - of - the - art barbecues on some Amish porches .
Here is a tool they see as increasing family coherence : Barbecues bring people together . "
Asked what kinds of questions the bishops will likely raise about cell phones , Kraybill replies , " Are cell phones being used ' to make a living ' or just for gossip and frivolous chatter ?
Will permitting cell phones lead to having phones in homes , and where will that lead ... to fax machines and the Internet ? "
" We do n't want to stop progress , we just want to slow it down , " several Amish told me .
Conversations about technology often turn on where to " hold the line " against the too - rapid advance of innovation .
Riding in automobiles to work , but not owning them , putting telephone shanties in fields , requiring battery power instead of electrical lines are all ways of holding the line .
And clearly a lot could be learned about the Amish hold - the - line philosophy by looking at those who either crossed the line or pushed it further out .
So I sought out several of the more boldly experimental members of the greater Plain community ( Amish and Mennonites and other religious groups sharing a kindred commitment to plain living ) .
In ranging from farmers who ran small enterprises in barnside sheds to well - equipped machine workshops and multimillion - dollar crafts factories , I soon was directed to Moses Smucker , who runs a harness shop in Churchtown , Pennsylvania .
Moses is an early adopter .
He did n't mind if I used his real name , a liberty that has made him the subject of a few other journalists ' stories .
When I arrived at his manufacturing headquarters , I took a look at some of the harnesses on display - one of them had a price tag of $ 12,000 .
If you 've ever seen the Budweiser Clydesdales Christmas commercials , you 've seen harness bells from Moses Smucker 's Churchtown workshop .
In the back of the store , more than a dozen young Amish men were working at modern machinery powered by hydraulics and diesel - generated electricity .
Upstairs , I saw a woman in traditional plain clothing seated in front of a PC .
Moses Smucker might look like Abe Lincoln , in his black suit and mustache - free beard , but he bore the same time - is - money air of any factory manager taking a few minutes out of a busy day to talk to the press .
Where Amos was rough hewn and wry , Moses seemed shrewd and slick .
His office was certainly in a different century from Amos's .
An electronic rolodex and an electric calculator sat atop an old roll - top desk .
I noticed a clock in the shape of a horse and buggy .
The whip ticked back and forth .
" When I started this business in 1970 , " Moses said , " it was n't accepted to have a telephone in the building , even in a business .
But the telephone began to be accepted through popular disobedience .
More businesses put them in and the bishops did n't stop them . "
Will the bishops also eventually allow phones in the home ?
I asked .
" When the telephone first came out here , people put them in their homes , " explained Moses .
" But they were party lines .
One time a woman overheard two other women gossiping about her .
She objected .
That was n't what we wanted for our families or our community , so the bishops met and home telephones were banned . "

I had heard the same story from several other Amish - in fact , this story seemed to be a key part of community mythology .
A writer named Diane Zimmerman Umble , who grew up in Lancaster County and had family roots in the Plain orders , traced the story to its origin , a 1986 memoir written by an Old Order Amishman born in 1897 .
As a graduate student , Zimmerman Umble started investigating Amish community telephones for a course on contemporary social theory , and ended up writing a book on the subject , Holding the Line : The Telephone in Old Order Mennonite and Amish Life .
Among her findings was the power of anecdote in the Amish decisionmaking process .
Anecdote , of course , is a key currency on the Internet , so I asked Moses if he'd heard stories about it .
Although he used a computer in his business , he did n't believe the Internet as currently constituted would ever be permitted .
Based on anecdotal evidence , he said , " It 's too unregulated , there 's too much trash , and there 's a worry people will use it for purposes unrelated to work . "
I asked another Amish workshop owner whom I 'll call Caleb what he thought about technology .
He pulled some papers out of a file cabinet , handed them to me , and said , " I share some of this fellow 's opinions , " pointing to a magazine interview with virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier .
Asked for an opinion he shared with the dreadlocked - and - dashikied Jaron , he replied , " I agree with his statement that you can't design foolproof machines , because fools are so clever . "
Caleb also discussed the Amish resistance to becoming " modern . "
They 're not worried about becoming people without religion or people who use lots of technology , he explained ; rather , the Amish fear assimilating the far more dangerous ideas that " progress " and new technologies are usually beneficial , that individuality is a precious value , that the goal of life is to " get ahead . "
This mind - set , not specific technologies , is what the Amish most object to .
" The thing I noticed about the telephone is the way it invades who you are , " Caleb said .
" We 're all losing who we are because of the telephone and other machines - not just the Amish . "
In Holding the Line , Zimmerman Umble writes : " Some Old Order people feel that relaxation of telephone rules reflects a movement toward an ' uncontrollable drift ' which must be halted .
Others see these steps as pragmatic choices necessary to hold the community together economically .
The paradox in the Old Order story is that the telephone does both :
It holds people together by making communication among community members possible , and it separates them from the world and from each other .
The telephone is both evil and good . "
Donald Kraybill , who is also provost of Messiah College , on the outskirts of Amish country , believes taboos about telephones are " a symbolic way of keeping the technology at a distance and making it your servant , rather than the other way around . "
Can they make the cell phone a servant ?
My questions on this score were answered mostly with anecdote .
I heard of one Amish man who was going to be late to a chiropractor appointment , so he pulled out his cell phone and called the receptionist from the bus he was on .
Zimmerman Umble heard of a Plain order businessman who called his stockbroker from his company car phone , pushing three taboos at once past their boundaries .
Zimmerman Umble pointed out that part of what makes cell phones so handy - the lack of a wire - also poses a special challenge for the Amish .
" In the early part of the community discussion , electrical and telephone lines carried substantial symbolic freight , " she said .
The wires meant that anyone in the community could easily see who was using electricity and phones .
" But now , in the absence of the line , behavior can't be monitored in the same way .
It is harder to maintain separation between home and business when you have a cell phone in your pocket .
In that sense it tests the community consensus about what is allowable . "
Calling around cell phone outlets in the Lancaster area , I found a merchant who has been selling cell phones to Plain folk for years .
" A great percentage of my customer base is Amish and Mennonite , " the merchant told me .
" More Amish than Mennonite .
We opened our cellular system 12 years ago .
Within the first year , I had an Amish customer .
He first called from his neighbor 's house .
He owned a painting business and told me he was n't allowed to have a cell phone personally , but his bishop said he could buy one for his foreman to use in the company truck .
It did n't take too long before I started getting quite a lot of telephone calls from the Amish . "
This raised quite a few interesting consumer technology questions .
Ordinarily , for example , one needs a credit card ( and good credit ) to secure a cell phone .
" The Amish pay in cash , " explained the merchant , who , along with most Amish - friendly shopkeepers , did n't want his name used .
" We normally ask for a driver 's license for the purpose of identification when we activate cellular service - of course , the Amish do n't have driver 's licenses .
They were n't able to get phones for several months , since we were n't allowed to open accounts without driver 's licenses .
So we had to make a policy change to accommodate them .
We ended up asking for another form of identification .
But the Amish do n't believe in photography , so we could n't get a photo ID .
Eventually we told them to get Pennsylvania state IDs without photographs .
" I 've sold hundreds of cell phones to them , primarily business phones , " the merchant continued , adding a few details about how the phones were used .
" Some Old Order Amish leave their cell phones in their shanty .
Some leave the phone overnight with an English neighbor , who recharges it for them ; then the Amish pick up the phone in the morning . "
It 's a pretty safe prediction that when the bishops get around to their formal ruling , cell phones will not be deemed appropriate for personal use .
In the 1910s , when the telephone was only beginning to change the world at large , the Old Order Amish recognized that the caller at the other end of the line was an interloper , someone who presumed to take precedence over the family 's normal , sacred , communications .
Keeping the telephone in an unheated shanty in a field , or even an outhouse , was keeping the phone in its proper place .
Though the Amish determination to allow phones at work but ban them at home might seem hard to accept , I appreciate the deliberation put into their decision .
In fact , similar reflection might highlight conflicts between our own practices and values .
How often do we interrupt a conversation with someone who is physically present in order to answer the telephone ?
Is the family meal enhanced by a beeper ?
Who exactly is benefiting from call waiting ?
Is automated voicemail a dark hint about the way our institutions value human time and life ?
Can pagers and cell phones that vibrate instead of ring solve the problem ?
Does the enjoyment of virtual communities by growing numbers of people enhance or erode citizen participation in the civic life of geographic communities ?
" What does the Old Order story have to say to members of postmodern society ? " asks Diane Zimmerman Umble .
" The struggle of Old Order groups to mold technology in the service of community provides a provocative model of resistance for those who have come to recognize that technology brings both benefits and costs ....
Their example invites reflection on a modern dilemma : how to balance the rights of the individual with the needs of the community .
For them , community comes first . "
Indeed , what does one 's use of a tool say to other people , particularly loved ones , about where they stand in our priorities ?
In my own house , we decided to get a rollover to voicemail instead of call waiting - experiences on the receiving end of call waiting convinced us that both parties on the other end of the line get pissed off when you interrupt the conversation .
No matter how absorbing the flame war of the moment might be , I make a point of suspending online communication when someone in my presence attempts to talk with me .
And I 've come to believe that face - to - face conversation should outrank disembodied conversation via cell phone or email .
I never expected the Amish to provide precise philosophical yardsticks that could guide the use of technological power .
What drew me in was their long conversation with their tools .
We technology - enmeshed " English " do n't have much of this sort of discussion .
And yet we 'll need many such conversations , because a modern heterogeneous society is going to have different values , different trade - offs , and different discourses .
It 's time we start talking about the most important influence on our lives today .
I came away from my journey with a question to contribute to these conversations :
If we decided that community came first , how would we use our tools differently ?
Low levels of vitamin D appear to be associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) in men , according to a new report .
Studies have shown that the rates of cardiovascular disease - related deaths are increased at higher latitudes and during the winter months and are lower at high altitudes , according to background information in the article .
" This pattern is consistent with an adverse effect of hypovitaminosis D [ vitamin D deficiency ] , which is more prevalent at higher latitudes , during the winter and at lower altitudes , " the authors write .
While other explanations are possible , vitamin D has been shown to affect the body in ways that may influence the risk of heart attack or heart disease .
Edward Giovannucci , M.D. , Sc.D. , of Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Boston , and colleagues reviewed medical records and blood samples of 454 men ( age 40 to 75 ) who had non-fatal heart attack or fatal heart disease from the date of blood collection ( between January 1993 and December 1995 ) until January 2004 .
They then compared the data from these men with records and blood samples of 900 living men who did not have a history of cardiovascular disease .
The men's diet and lifestyle factors , recorded by self - administered questionnaires were also noted .
Men with a vitamin D deficiency ( having 15 nanograms per milliliter of blood or less ) had an increased risk for heart attack compared with those with a sufficient amount ( having 30 nanograms per milliliter of blood or more ) of vitamin D. " After additional adjustment for family history of myocardial infarction , body mass index , alcohol consumption , physical activity , history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension , ethnicity , region , marine omega 3 intake , low - and high - density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and triglyceride levels , this relationship remained significant , " the authors write .
Men with intermediate levels of vitamin D had a higher risk of heart attack than those with sufficient vitamin D levels .
" Vitamin D deficiency has been related to an increasing number of conditions and to total mortality .
These results further support an important role for vitamin D in myocardial infarction risk , " the authors conclude .
" Thus , the present findings add further support that the current dietary requirements of vitamin D need to be increased to have an effect on circulating 25 ( OH ) D [ vitamin D ] levels substantially large enough for potential health benefits . "

The Mega RailsConf 2008 Round Up
By Peter Cooper
RailsConf 2008 - the primary conference for Rails developers - took place over the last few days ( May 29th to June 1st , 2008 ) .
By all accounts , everyone had a great time , but not everyone could attend so here 's a casual roundup of what happened .
The best overall " walkthrough " of the conference I 've seen has been by Drew Blas who put together a great set of blog posts covering : Friday morning , Friday afternoon , Friday evening , Saturday morning , Saturday afternoon , Saturday evening , Sunday morning and Sunday afternoon .
He even put together a final summary .
Great work Drew !
For Italian readers , RailsConfLive is a remarkable resource too .
Alternatively , Gregg Pollack 's set of videos , including " Railsconf in 36 minutes . "
Interviews
Quite a few informal interviews took place at the conference , mostly by the guys from GotThingsDone .
Worth watching are Geoffrey Grosenbach , John Straw , Ola Bini , Ryan Singer , Joel Spolsky , David Heinemeier Hansson , Jeremy Kemper , and Chris Wanstrath .
Gregg Pollack of RailsEnvy also interviewed Obie Fernandez , Chu Yeow , Amy Hoy , Michael " Koz " Koziarski , David Heinemeier Hansson , Bruce Williams , and Ninh Bui .
Selection of Presentations
Note :
You can download the presentation files used by some of the speakers from the official RailsConf site .
DHH Keynote : Thanks to Daniel Wanja , you can watch David Heinemeier Hansson 's keynote presentation .
It 's a bit of a shaky video and only made up of extracts , so it jumps a bit too .
I imagine a better video will be available soon .
Essentially , DHH moves from technical concerns to becoming a self - help and health advisor .
RailsConf 2008 Welcome Keynote :
The welcome keynote , featuring Chad Fowler , David Heinemeier Hansson and Joel Spolsky is up on YouTube .
Ruby Heroes : RailsConf 2008 marked the inauguration of the " Ruby Hero " award .
The ultimate winners were Evan Weaver , Tom Copeland , James Edward Gray II , Ilya Grigorik , Yehuda Katz and Ryan Bates .
You can watch the video of the awards presentation at Vimeo .
Getting Git : Scott Chacon did a talk on " Getting Git " .
It perhaps sets the record for number of slides at 520 covered in 55 minutes .
The Other mod_rails - Deployment with JRuby : Nick Sieger did a presentation about using JRuby to deploy Rails applications .
Pastie : Josh Goebel did a presentation about the popular Pastie source - code - pasting site .
Microapps for Fun and Profit : Erik Kastner talked about developing very small " microapps " using Rails .
Assembling Pages Last : Aaron Batalion presented on edge caching with Rails .
Advanced RESTful Rails : Ben Scofield covers the use of REST with Rails and includes lots of simple code examples .
Perhaps the slides lack a lot of what happened in the presentation , but this seems like basic REST stuff than " advanced " so it 's well worth a read even if you do n't use REST yet .
Scaling Ruby from the Inside Out : Ezra Zygmuntowicz on scaling Ruby , and Vertebra a new " next generation cloud computing / automation framework . "
Scaling Rails Panel : A panel of Blaine Cook , Bradley Taylor , Ezra Zygmuntowicz , Jim Meyer and Kevin Lawver talk about the issues when scaling Rails applications .
Railsconf in 36 Minutes :
Not a presentation , but roving reporter Gregg Pollack went around and asked a lot of the presenters to summarize their talks in 30 seconds .
It makes for a great summary of the conference .
It features the interviews linked above too .
Lightning Talk Summaries : A summary of the lightning talks given at the conference .
The RailsConf Message Board
It seems to be a tradition at Ruby / Rails conferences to put up a big " message board " for people to write / graffiti on as they see fit .
RailsConf 08 was no exception .
Vinícius Manhães
Teles has taken a great high - resolution picture of the board .
Messages include promotion for a new Gem called gitjour , codesmack.com t- shirts and a crazy number of requests for Rails developers ( Zappos.com , Engine Yard , AideRSS , Synaptic Mash , Grockit , XMinute and Intridea are all hiring ! ) .
Announcements
Rails 2.1 Launched : Rails 2.1 was officially launched .
More about this on Ruby Inside in the next couple of days !

News from the Votemaster
Not much news today except kid power .
The NY Times has a story about how the college - age children of the superdelegates are badgering them to come out in support of Barack Obama .
One new primary poll though , in Oregon , where Barack Obama is leading Hillary Clinton .
State Pollster End date Clinton Obama McCain Huckabee Paul Oregon SurveyUSA Apr. 6 42 % 52 %
The polling results for all primaries and caucuses are available as a Web page and in .csv format .
Here are the delegate totals from various news sources rounded to integers ( Democrats Abroad has 22 delegates , each with 1/2 vote ) .
The sources differ because in most caucus states , no delegates to the national conventions have been chosen yet , just delegates to the district , county , or state convention so there is some guesswork involved .
Furthermore , some of the unpledged delegates are elected at state conventions in May or June .
Finally , the PLEOs ( Party Leaders and Elected Officials ) sometimes waver and may tell different reporters slightly different stories that they interpret differently .

If you are in a position where you need a personal loan , you want to get certain advice that can make the process much easier overall .
These loans can be of great help in a number of situations , but you do n’t want to get one before you educate yourself .
Those who take the time to do this will significantly boost their chances of getting what they need to make it through a tough time .
Whether you want to buy a car or just have to catch up on some bills , this advice can be of great help .
Use the Internet
These days getting a personal loan can be accomplished by spending only about 20 minutes online .
You will be able to apply for a payday loan through the lending company ’s site .
This gives you a very quick and efficient way to get the process started .
Make certain that you find a lender that offers a fast application that you can fill out fairly quickly .
This is doubly important if you are really in a hurry to get your funds .
You will definitely save a lot of time by going this route .
Choose a Private Lending Company
When you need a personal loan , your first instinct might be to go through a bank .
The fact is that private lenders have a lot more to offer .
The companies that give out payday loans online are largely reputable and legitimate as a whole .
These businesses will be able to provide you with a substantial loan to help you out financially .
Private lenders have skyrocketed in popularity all throughout the UK for many reasons .
One such reason is that a private lender does n’t demand that all applicants have a good credit score .
Get Yourself Organized Before Applying
Before you even begin the application for your personal loan , you should make a point of organizing yourself .
This means getting together all of the documents you will need to turn over to the lender .
You will most likely be required to send them a copy of your driver ’s license or passport , proof of income , and some other things .
Take a close look at the eligibility requirements the lender has laid out on their site .
This will give you a better idea as to what you will need to have before getting started .
Do n’t Borrow More Than You Need
While it might seem a little obvious to some , it is important that you not borrow more money than you truly need .
This is something that can actually cause you some major problems , so it should be avoided altogether .
Spend all the time necessary figuring out the exact number that you will require .
This is something that you will have to put down in your online application , so it ’s important to know .
Do n’t Assume You ’ll Have a Sky High Interest Rate
Many people who get a payday loan just assume they will have to pay an outrageously high interest rate , but this is n’t always the case .
You should devote a decent amount of time to doing your research .
This will involve comparing the rates that various private lending companies offer .
You should be able to get this information on the lender ’s site without any issues .
The more time you take to compare these rates , the better of a deal you will get on your loan .
A few percentage points can mean paying a lot more than you have to , so you ’ll want to keep that in mind .
Find a Reputable Lender You Can Trust
It ’s also imperative that you find a truly reputable lender that you can trust to provide you with a solid overall deal .
You do n’t want to choose just anyone , because that will most likely only lead to trouble .
Make sure that you find out what sort of reputation each lending company has so you will be able to make the right decision in the end .
Not all of these lenders are going to match your needs , so you therefore have to narrow down your options .
This research will certainly be worth it in the end .
The right lender can go a long way towards getting ideal terms of your loan .
Before you finalize a personal loan , you will have to first consider all of these things .
This is a delicate process that must be approached with the utmost care .
You do n’t want to choose a certain lender until you are totally satisfied with your decision .
Payday loans are quickly becoming the standard borrowing option for smaller amounts .
It is highly recommended that you take some time to find out why this is .
If you need to borrow a few hundred pounds right away , there is really no better solution .
You can get the money you need without any frustrating red tape .
As we noted last month , a number of states have been considering laws that , under the guise of " academic freedom , " single out evolution for special criticism .
Most of them have n't made it out of the state legislatures , and one that did was promptly vetoed .
But the last of these bills under consideration , the Louisiana Science Education Act ( LSEA ) , was enacted by the signature of Governor Bobby Jindal yesterday .
The bill would allow local school boards to approve supplemental classroom materials specifically for the critique of scientific theories , allowing poorly - informed board members to stick their communities with Dover - sized legal fees .
The text of the LSEA suggests that it 's intended to foster critical thinking , calling on the state Board of Education to " assist teachers , principals , and other school administrators to create and foster an environment within public elementary and secondary schools that promotes critical thinking skills , logical analysis , and open and objective discussion of scientific theories . "
Unfortunately , it 's remarkably selective in its suggestion of topics that need critical thinking , as it cites scientific subjects " including , but not limited to , evolution , the origins of life , global warming , and human cloning . "
Oddly , the last item on the list is not the subject of any scientific theory ; the remainder are notable for being topics that are the focus of frequent political controversies rather than scientific ones .
The opposition
The bill has been opposed by every scientific society that has voiced a position on it , including the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
AAAS CEO Alan Leshner warned that the bill would " unleash an assault against scientific integrity , leaving students confused about science and unprepared to excel in a modern workforce . "
Jindal , who was a biology major during his time at Brown University , even received a veto plea from his former genetics professor .
" Without evolution , modern biology , including medicine and biotechnology , would n't make sense , " Professor Arthur Landy wrote .
" I hope he [ Jindal ] does n't do anything that would hold back the next generation of Louisiana 's doctors . "
Lining up to promote the bill were a coalition of religious organizations and Seattle 's pro-Intelligent Design think tank , the Discovery Institute .
According to the Louisiana Science Coalition , Discovery fellows helped write the bill and arranged for testimony in its favor in the legislature .
The bill itself plays directly into Discovery 's strategy , freeing local schools to " use supplemental textbooks and other instructional materials to help students understand , analyze , critique , and review scientific theories in an objective manner . "
Discovery , conveniently , has made just such a supplemental text available .
As we noted in our earlier analysis , Discovery hopes to use these bills as a way to push its own textbook into the classroom .
Having now read the text of the book , it is clear that our earlier analysis was correct ; the book badly misrepresents the scientific community 's understanding of evolution in order to suggest that the basics of the theory are questioned by biologists .
In doing so , it ignores many of the specific questions about evolution that are actively debated by scientists .
Courts in Pennsylvania and Georgia have both ruled that laws which single out evolution serve no secular purpose and are evidence of unconstitutional religious motivations .
Those precedents , however , do not apply to Louisiana , and it's possible that the LSEA will either be ruled constitutional or remain in force for years before a court rejects it .
That will leave the use of supplemental scientific material to be determined by local school boards in the intervening years and , if boards in Florida are viewed as evidence , they are likely to be spectacularly incapable of judging scientific issues .
As such , most observers are expecting the passage of the LSEA by the state to unleash a series of Dover - style cases , as various local boards attempt to discover the edges of what 's constitutionally allowable .
The AAAS ' Leshner suggested that the bill 's passage would " provoke an expensive , divisive legal fight . "
In vetoing similar legislation in Oklahoma , Governor Brad Henry suggested it would end up " subjecting them [ school officials ] to an explosion of costly and protracted litigation that would have to be defended at taxpayers ' expense . "
In essence , Jindal is inviting local school boards to partake in that explosion without committing the state to paying the inevitable costs .
In the meantime , the students of the state will be subjected to an " anything goes " approach to science — if it looks scientific to a school board , it can appear in the classroom .

An 18 year old girl tells her mom that she has missed her last 2 periodsVery worried , the mother goes to the drugstore and buys a pregnancy test .
The test result shows that the girl is pregnant .
Crying , cursing and Shouting the mother says , " Who was the bastard that did this to you ?
I want to know !
" The girl picks up the phone and makes a call .
Half an hour later , a Rolls - Royce stops in front of their house .
A mature and distinguished man with gray hair and impeccably dressed in an Armani suit steps out of the of the Royce and enters the house .
He sits in the living room with the father , mother , and the girl and tells them : " Good morning , your daughter has informed me of the problem .
I can't marry her because of my personal family situation but I 'll take care of it . "
" I will pay all costs and provide for your daughter for the rest of her life . "
" Additionally , if a girl is born , I will bequeath a Royce , a mansion , two retail stores , a townhouse , a beachfront villa , and a $ 2,000,000 bank account .
If a boy is born , my legacy will be a couple of factories and a $ 4,000,000 bank account .
If twins , they will receive a factory and $ 2,000,000 each .
However , if there is a miscarriage , what do you suggest I do ?
" At this point , the father , who had remained silent , places a hand menacingly on the man 's shoulder and tells him , " You fuck her again .
" An attractive young woman on a flight from Ireland asked the priest beside her , " Father , may I ask a favor ? " " Of course child .
What may I do for you ? " " Well , I bought my mother an expensive hair dryer for her birthday .
It is unopened but well over the customs limits and I 'm afraid they 'll confiscate it .
Is there any way you could carry it through Customs for me ?
Hide it under your robes perhaps ? "
" I would love to help you , dear , but I must warn you , I will not lie . " " With your honest face , Father , no one will question you , " she replied .
When they got to Customs , she let the priest go first .
The official asked , " Father , do you have anything to declare ? " " From the top of my head down to my waist I have nothing to declare .
"
The official thought this answer strange , so asked , " And what do you have to declare from your waist to the floor ? " Father replied , " I have a marvelous instrument designed to be used on a woman , which is , to date , unused .
" Roaring with laughter , the official said , " Go ahead , Father .
Next please !
" When I was 13 , I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend with big tits .
When I was 16 , I got a girlfriend with big tits , but there was no passion , so I decided I needed a passionate girl with zest for life .
In college I dated a passionate girl , but she was too emotional .
Everything was an emergency ; she was a drama queen , cried all the time and threatened suicide .
So I decided I needed a girl with stability .
When I was 25 , I found a very stable girl but she was boring .
She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything .
Life became so dull that I decided I needed a girl with some excitement .
When I was 28 , I found an exciting girl , but I could n't keep up with her .
She rushed from one thing to another , never settling on anything .
She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy .
She was great fun initially and very energetic , but directionless .
So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition .
When I turned 30 , I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground , so I married her .
She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned .
I am older and wiser now , and I am looking for a girl with big tits .
A Chinese doctor can't find a job in a hospital in the US , so he opens a clinic and puts a sign outside that reads " GET TREATMENT FOR $ 20 - IF NOT CURED GET BACK $ 100 .
" An American lawyer thinks this is a great opportunity to earn $ 100 and goes to the clinic .
Lawyer : " I have lost my sense of taste .
" Chinese : " Nurse , bring medicine from box No. 22 and put 3 drops in patient 's mouth .
" Lawyer : " Ugh. this is kerosene .
" Chinese : " Congrats , your sense of taste is restored .
Give me $ 20 .
" The annoyed lawyer goes back after a few days to recover his money .
Lawyer : " I have lost my memory .
I cannot remember anything .
" Chinese : " Nurse , bring medicine from box no . 22 and put 3 drops in his mouth .
" Lawyer ( annoyed ) : " This is kerosene .
You gave this to me last time for restoring my taste .
" Chinese : " Congrats .
You got your memory back .
Give me $ 20 .
" The fuming lawyer pays him , and then comes back a week later determined to get back $ 100 .
Lawyer : " My eyesight has become very weak I can't see at all .
" Chinese : " Well , I do n't have any medicine for that , so take this $ 100 .
" Lawyer ( staring at the note ) : " But this is $ 20 , not $ 100 !!
" Chinese : " Congrats , your eyesight is restored .
Give me $ 20 " Two little boys stole a big bag of oranges from a neighbor .
They decided to go to a quiet place to share the lot equally .
One of them suggested the nearby cemetery .
As they were jumping over the gate to enter the cemetery , two oranges fell out of the big bag but they did n't bother to pick them since they had enough in the bag .
A few minutes later , a drunkard on his way from a bar , passed near the cemetery gate & heard a voice saying : " One for me , one for you .
One for me , one for you .
One for me , one for you .
" He immediately sobered up & ran as fast as he could to a church nearby , for the priest " Father , please come with me .
Come & witness God & Satan sharing corpses at the cemetery " They both ran back to the cemetery gate & the voice continued : " One for me , one for you .
One for me , one for you .
One for me , one for you .
" Suddenly , the voice stopped counting & said : " What about the two at the gate ? "

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Sixteen members of a smuggling gang in China and Hong Kong have been arrested for rigging a 300 - metre long cable to send contraband goods across the heavily - policed border , a newspaper reported Thursday .
The gang had initially used a crossbow to shoot the cable across the fenced - off border between the two sides , before stringing it from the top of a Chinese highrise down to a village house in Hong Kong , the South China Morning Post reported .
Investigators said the gang had likely been operating for two to three weeks , using a zip wire and pulley system to whisk small batches of goods along the cable , mostly at night .
“ They took 10 to 15 seconds to smuggle goods weighing 3 - 5 kg , such as 20 - 30 mobile phones each time , ” Leo Sin , a senior Hong Kong customs ’ intelligence officer was quoted as saying .
Electronics goods worth more than $ 770,000 were seized , including 3,300 mobile phones and 2,100 computer memory cards , the paper reported .
The newspaper said it was the first time such a method had been deployed by cross - border smugglers , who have in the past dug tunnels to ferret electronics underground and to pump contraband diesel between the two sides .
Twelve people from mainland China and four from Hong Kong were arrested .
Even though I can not please everyone all the time I like to please everyone most of the time .

Confirming our belief that some people are just " bad with computers , " a boy named Joe Falciatano III from Pulaski , New York , seems to have simply the worst luck ever -- and some think it could be do to an overly magnetized touch .
While using PCs at this elementary school , Joe -- who dubbed himself " Magneto Man " -- found that every system he laid his hands on went totally haywire .
Only after a teacher suggested he use a grounded , anti-static wrist strap did the systems experience relief from his Geek Squad - inducing grasp .
Apparently , the boy has also disrupted slide show presentations and caused his Xbox to freeze repeatedly .
Though tests have been run on Joe , there 's still no conclusive evidence about the source of the problem , though at least one electricity expert said the cause could be his over - insulated shoes .
Maybe , but we wo n't be surprised when he forms an army of mutant super - villains and tries to take control of the White House .

Search in Yosemite for missing man who asked to be alone to read Bible
A search is under way at Yosemite National Park for a 22 - year - old man who disappeared Sunday after telling friends he wanted to be alone for half an hour to read his Bible .
More than 100 rescuers from Tuolomne , Mono , Marin and Santa Clara counties resumed their search this morning for Esmyn Garmendia - Barrios , a native of Honduras who is believed to be living in Fresno .
" It is very difficult terrain , " said Adrienne Freeman , a Yosemite spokeswoman .
Garmendia - Barrios drove to the park with friends Sunday afternoon to see the waterfalls , she said .
They stopped at Washburn Point , a popular lookout on Glacier Point Road , and Garmendia - Barrios asked for a brief period of solitude , Freeman said .
When his companions returned 30 minutes later , he was gone .
Park rangers were soon notified and a search began .
An expanded search Monday failed to locate signs of the missing man .
" We are concentrating right now in the area around Washburn , " Freeman said .
" Our goal is to do a detailed ground search from there . "
Weather conditions at the 6,000 - foot spot have been moderate , she said .
Garmendia - Barrios is 5 - foot - 7 with brown hair and brown eyes .
He was wearing blue jeans , a blue T - shirt and black shoes .
He speaks Spanish fluently , as well as some English , and was carrying a Bible , Freeman said .
" He 's a muscular guy , " she said .
" He 's a soccer player and is in good shape .
He probably has a high survivability because he 's fit .
But it 's also a negative for us because it means he could have traveled a far distance . "
Park officials are asking any visitors who were in the Glacier Point , Washburn Point or Sentinel Dome areas after 2 p.m. Sunday to contact investigators .
" We want to hear from everybody who may have been in the area , " Freeman said .
" Even if they did not see the missing man , it helps us if we can rule out places . "
Investigators can be reached at ( 209 ) 372-0311 .
MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) --
A battle royale over an estimated $ 500 million treasure that a Florida deep - sea salvage company found last year is due for a fresh round in court in Florida on Monday .
Security forces cordon off the Ocean Alert , an Odyssey Marine Exploration ship , in July 2007 .
The Spanish government now says the 500,000 silver and gold coins that the company , Odyssey Marine Exploration , found last year in the Atlantic Ocean near Spain came from one of its ships that sunk in a 19th - century naval battle .
Spain wants the entire treasure returned , but Odyssey insists Spain may have no right to it .
Lawyers for both sides are due to present arguments Monday morning in a U.S. federal court in Tampa , Florida , in another round of the case that started last year , Odyssey spokeswoman Natja Igney told CNN .
Odyssey found the coins last year and quietly airlifted them in crates from Gibraltar , a British colony on Spain 's southern tip , to Florida for safekeeping .
The company then said it was unclear how the huge quantity of coins it found on the seabed had gotten there .
It declined to reveal the location , citing security reasons , and mysteriously dubbed the site " Black Swan . "
But the Spanish government , at a recent Madrid news conference , said it 's really not so complicated .
" The mystery is over , " said James Goold , a U.S. lawyer representing Spain , told the news conference .
" Using a variety of methods to conceal what it was doing , Odyssey Marine Exploration stripped the gravesite that is the Spanish navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes of coins and other objects . "
" The coins and other artifacts that Odyssey took from the site are documented to have been on the Mercedes , " Goold said .
The Mercedes was a 34 - gun frigate , a ship very common at the time in the Spanish navy .
The Mercedes left Peru , stopped in Uruguay and was just a day 's sail from Spain when the four - ship Spanish squadron was attacked by a British fleet in October 1804 , according to a Spanish government 's filing to the Florida court .
In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary , south of Portugal , the Mercedes exploded after being hit in its powder magazine .
It sank with its cargo , killing the 200 Spanish sailors and civilians aboard .
Spain accuses Odyssey of looting the gravesite of a sovereign Spanish - flagged navy vessel .
But Odyssey executives are n't so sure the coins came from the Mercedes , and they say they certainly did n't come from a gravesite .
" I think in order to have a gravesite , you certainly need the remains of a shipwreck , and you would certainly need the remains of some humans .
Neither has been found at the site , " Odyssey co-founder Greg Stemm told CNN .
He invited Spanish experts to join Odyssey in further investigation .
Watch Stemm describe the gold that was found »
But Spain says it has seen the evidence .
It recently dispatched a team , including a government marine archaeologist and coin expert , to Florida to examine the treasure held by Odyssey .
These specialists told the Madrid news conference that it's a vast trove of coins , including fabled " pieces of eight , " some minted in 1803 in Lima , Peru -- then a Spanish colony .
Stemm told CNN most of the 500,000 coins are silver ; with a smaller amount being gold .
The visiting Spanish experts , he said , saw only a small percentage of the coins , and he called for more research .
" We are not after the gold , " Guillermo Corral Van Damme , a Ministry of Culture senior official told CNN .
" We are after the history , of the memory , of the respect , essentially , for what is a marine graveyard of our people . "
But Stemm countered , " Well , if they 're really not in it for the money , then we would be happy just to keep all the coins and do the archaeological work at no charge , if it turns out there 's a Spanish interest . "
The Peruvian government also is monitoring this case , a Peruvian diplomat told CNN .
Media reports have quoted some authorities there as saying Peru might also have a claim , if it 's proven that some of the treasure came from Peru .
Spain might be willing to share some of the treasure with Peru , but out of a sense of a common cultural heritage , rather than a strictly monetary operation , Jose Jimenez , another Spanish Ministry of Culture senior official , told the Madrid news conference .
Odyssey says its leading hypothesis is that the coins may have come from the Mercedes , pending further research , Odyssey lawyer Melinda MacConnel told CNN .
But MacConnel said even if it's proven that the treasure was aboard the Mercedes , Spain still does n't have an automatic claim because the ship , at the time , did not meet the legal standard for " a sovereign immune vessel . "
" This ship was not on a military mission at the time of its sinking .
It was transporting mostly private goods , actually , " MacConnel said .
But Goold , the Washington - based lawyer for Spain , told CNN , " This case has a lot more visibility because of the artificial mystery that was created , and because of the large amount of gold and silver that was taken from the ship .
But the legal principles are not new . "
" I 've been to court before on them and we have always won and we expect the same result here , " Goold said .
" A navy ship is a navy ship .
This is property of the national government , subject to exclusive control of the national government . "
The court hearing on Monday in Tampa is not expected to be the last round in this battle over the treasure .
All About Spain • United States
A recently published patent application discovered by MacRumors reveals that Apple is investigating the use of solar power in versions of their mobile devices -- both handheld devices and portable computers .
Integrating solar power into a mobile device holds the enormous potential of extending battery life significantly .
However , successfully integrating solar panels into these small devices is not without its challenges .
The major issues described are the limited area available to solar panels , durability , and the " wasting " of space on a portable device .
It is due to these problems that solar power has not found its way into mobile devices , not just from Apple , but from all manufacturers .
The most interesting technique described by Apple , however , is the integration of the solar panels behind the actual LCD screen of a portable device .
The solar panel would absorb ambient light that passes through the LCD screen of the device .
This could eliminate any additional footprint typically required by the solar panels .
If successfully implemented , Apple 's iPhone , iPod and laptops , could require no outward changes in design to add solar power .
Apple 's not the only one exploring this technology as an old ( 2001 ) Motorola patent describes the same technique .
While several limitations to the technique were described at that time , the issues may have been better addressed in recent years .

The targeted offenses : if you are stolen , call the police at once .
please omnivorously put the waste in garbage can .
deformed man lavatory .
For the past 18 months , teams of language police have been scouring Beijing on a mission to wipe out all such traces of bad English signage before the Olympics come to town in August .
They 're the type of goofy transgressions that we in the English homelands love to poke fun at , devoting entire Web sites to so - called Chinglish .
( By the way , that last phrase means " handicapped bathroom . " )
But what if these sentences are n't really bad English ?
What if they are evidence that the English language is happily leading an alternative lifestyle without us ?
Thanks to globalization , the Allied victories in World War II , and American leadership in science and technology , English has become so successful across the world that it 's escaping the boundaries of what we think it should be .
In part , this is because there are fewer of us :
By 2020 , native speakers will make up only 15 percent of the estimated 2 billion people who will be using or learning the language .
Already , most conversations in English are between nonnative speakers who use it as a lingua franca .
In China , this sort of free - form adoption of English is helped along by a shortage of native English - speaking teachers , who are hard to keep happy in rural areas for long stretches of time .
An estimated 300 million Chinese — roughly equivalent to the total US population — read and write English but do n't get enough quality spoken practice .
The likely consequence of all this ?
In the future , more and more spoken English will sound increasingly like Chinese .
It 's not merely that English will be salted with Chinese vocabulary for local cuisine , bon mots , and curses or that speakers will peel off words from local dialects .
The Chinese and other Asians already pronounce English differently — in both subtle and not - so - subtle ways .
For example , in various parts of the region they tend not to turn vowels in unstressed syllables into neutral vowels .
Instead of " har - muh - nee , " it 's " har - moh - nee . "
And the sounds that begin words like this and thing are often enunciated as the letters f , v , t , or d .
In Singaporean English ( known as Singlish ) , think is pronounced " tink , " and theories is " tee - oh - rees . "
English will become more like Chinese in other ways , too .
Some grammatical appendages unique to English ( such as adding do or did to questions ) will drop away , and our practice of not turning certain nouns into plurals will be ignored .
Expect to be asked : " How many informations can your flash drive hold ? "
In Mandarin , Cantonese , and other tongues , sentences do n't require subjects , which leads to phrases like this : " Our goalie not here yet , so give chance , can or not ? "
One noted feature of Singlish is the use of words like ah , lah , or wah at the end of a sentence to indicate a question or get a listener to agree with you .
They 're each pronounced with tone — the linguistic feature that gives spoken Mandarin its musical quality — adding a specific pitch to words to alter their meaning .
( If you say " xin " with an even tone , it means " heart " ; with a descending tone it means " honest . " )
According to linguists , such words may introduce tone into other Asian - English hybrids .
Given the number of people involved , Chinglish is destined to take on a life of its own .
Advertisers will play with it , as they already do in Taiwan .
It will be celebrated as a form of cultural identity , as the Hong Kong Museum of Art did in a Chinglish exhibition last year .
It will be used widely online and in movies , music , games , and books , as it is in Singapore .
Someday , it may even be taught in schools .
Ultimately , it 's not that speakers will slide along a continuum , with " proper " language at one end and local English dialects on the other , as in countries where creoles are spoken .
Nor will Chinglish replace native languages , as creoles sometimes do .
It 's that Chinglish will be just as proper as any other English on the planet .
And it 's possible Chinglish will be more efficient than our version , doing away with word endings and the articles a , an , and the .
After all , if you can figure out " Environmental sanitation needs your conserve , " maybe conservation is n't so necessary .
Any language is constantly evolving , so it 's not surprising that English , transplanted to new soil , is bearing unusual fruit .
Nor is it unique that a language , spread so far from its homelands , would begin to fracture .
The obvious comparison is to Latin , which broke into mutually distinct languages over hundreds of years — French , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese , Romanian .
A less familiar example is Arabic :
The speakers of its myriad dialects are connected through the written language of the Koran and , more recently , through the homogenized Arabic of Al Jazeera .
But what 's happening to English may be its own thing :
It 's mingling with so many more local languages than Latin ever did , that it's on a path toward a global tongue — what 's coming to be known as Panglish .
Soon , when Americans travel abroad , one of the languages they 'll have to learn may be their own .

COLOMBO ( Reuters ) - A suicide bomber crashed his motorbike into a police bus in the Sri Lankan capital on Friday , killing 10 people , and authorities said Tamil Tiger rebels were to blame .
Slideshow ( 10 images )
Doctors at the National Hospital in Colombo said eight policemen and two civilians were killed and more than 85 people wounded in the blast in a commercial quarter of the capital .
The area is a high security zone containing Sri Lanka ’s presidential office and military headquarters .
The military blamed the attack on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , who want an independent state in the north and east of the island .
The Tigers , who routinely deny involvement in such attacks , were not immediately available for comment .
“ The target was a police bus and a motorbike crashed into the police bus , ” said military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara .
President Mahinda Rajapaksa condemned the attack and appealed for calm .
“ With this bomb attack on a busy street , the LTTE has once again demonstrated to the world its total commitment to violence and terror to achieve its separatist goals in Sri Lanka , and its absolute contempt for democracy and human rights , ” he said in a statement .
Sri Lankan television showed the shattered side of the bus and other damaged vehicles , and casualties being rushed to hospital in private vehicles and taxis .
Fighting between government forces and the Tigers has intensified since the government formally pulled out of a six - year - old ceasefire pact in January , though a renewed civil war has been raging since 2006 .
Air force fighters carried out raids on a Tamil Tiger runway in rebel - held Kilinochchi in the far north on Friday evening .
“ Fighter jets bombed Iranamadu runway at 8.00 p.m. and pilots say the target was taken accurately , ” said air force spokesman Wingcommander Andrew Wijesuriya .
On Friday morning , jets bombed a rebel sea Tiger base in the north for a second day running , the military said , adding ground troops had killed 33 rebel fighters over the past two days .
The LTTE has not commented on the latest clashes and independent confirmation of battlefield casualties is not possible because of lack of access .
Each side is known to exaggerate the other ’s losses .
According to a compilation of military data , about 360 rebels have been killed in the fighting in May with the loss of 41 soldiers .
An estimated 70,000 people have been killed in the 25 - year civil war .
Analysts say the military has the upper hand in the latest phase of the conflict because of superior air power , strength of numbers and swathes of terrain captured in the island ’s east .
But they still see no clear military victory on the horizon .
The Tigers regularly hit back with roadside bombs and suicide attacks , increasingly against civilians , experts and the military say , deterring tourists and worrying investors .

Angry , offensive messages started popping up more than a year ago on the Glen A. Wilson High School page on Wikipedia , the popular user - edited online encyclopedia .
The writer , who said he was a student , hid behind an anonymous e-mail address to threaten by name Asian students at the San Gabriel Valley school , hurl racial slurs at the school ’s primarily Asian badminton team and allude to possible attacks .
“ I would love to see her shot right between the eyes with blood gushing out from her mouth begging for mercy as she clings onto a single shred of life , ” read a message about an Asian student posted May 28 , 2007 .
“ Haha now there ’s a great fantasy . ”
School district officials and sheriff ’s detectives did not start investigating the messages until two weeks ago , after Wikipedia staff alerted them to a violent threat posted April 16 , the one - year anniversary of the Virginia Tech shooting and a few days before the anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School .
Advertisement
“ On Friday , April 18 , 2008 , there will be a shooting at this school , ” the threat said , promising to target “ a good majority of the badminton team and almost every single fob ” -- a reference to recent Asian immigrants “ fresh off the boat . ”
“ Take this text down , ” the message warned , “ and it will guarantee their death . ”
On the 17th , after another threat was posted on the page , school officials canceled classes for the following day .
That day investigators arrested a 15 - year - old Wilson student .
The student , whose name has not been released , pleaded not guilty April 22 to seven counts of making criminal threats and was being held at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall pending a psychological evaluation .
His next hearing is scheduled for May 9 .
As authorities investigate previous messages the student may have posted on Wikipedia and MySpace that could lead to other charges , they are considering how best to monitor the school ’s 1,700 computer - savvy students and their virtual social lives .
Advertisement
On Wednesday , school officials and investigators met with about 200 parents in the Wilson High School gym to discuss the threats .
Parents scrawled questions on index cards , which administrators read aloud :
“ Was the threat a prank ? ”
“ Did the police know about the messages posted last year ? ”
“ Were messages sent from a school computer ?
If so , why did school officials wait until after the second threat to close the school ? ”
Advertisement
Sheriff ’s investigators said that after Wikipedia staff notified them of the first threat at 10:30 p.m.
April 16 , they assigned 13 detectives to the case and notified the six students mentioned in the threat , along with their families .
They also dispatched officers to patrol outside the students ’ homes .
At least one message was sent from a school computer , according to online records .
But school officials had been unaware of earlier threats on the 3 - year - old Wikipedia page because , like other districts , they mainly monitor school - related messages on Facebook and MySpace -- hot spots for students socializing online , said Michael Droe , the district ’s chief technology officer .
Students mostly use Wikipedia for research .
The school ’s Wikipedia page is unofficial , created by someone who does n’t work for the district , according to the page ’s online history .
Technically , it ’s beyond district control .
The district can ask companies or individuals to take down pages , but they rarely do , since the messages could be pranks posted by people outside the school or even the country .
Officials decided not to close school the morning after they discovered the threat and instead sent additional police to search students ’ bags as they arrived .

Among those searched , police said , was the sophomore who would later be arrested in connection with the threats .
Despite the student ’s warning not to remove his April 16 threat , district officials felt it was dangerous enough to be removed , and contacted Wikipedia ’s San Francisco - based staff the next morning .
The site ’s nonprofit parent , the Wikimedia Foundation , has a budget of $ 4.5 million but a tiny staff of 16 paid employees .
Most Wikipedia administrators , the people who monitor the pages , are volunteers , and Wikipedia largely relies on users to alert them to “ vandalism . ”
A few hours after Wikipedia staff removed the student ’s first threat , he had posted a second .
Advertisement
“ You removed my last edit .
I gave you a fair warning .
Now the people listed in my previous edit will be victims in the Glen A. Wilson Shooting to occur this Friday , ” he wrote .
“ Be prepared to have 33 families mourn the loss of their children and place a lawsuit upon your shoulders . ”
Again , the district asked Wikipedia staff to remove the message , and they complied , even placing a block on the page that bars postings from unidentified e-mail addresses .
Investigators would not tell parents at the meeting last week whether the arrested student was planning to attack the school , or what they found during a search of the student ’s home .
They said the “ A ” student , an only child with cousins at the high school , had never been arrested before , cooperated with them and made a full confession .
Messages posted from the same e-mail address defended the writing as free speech .
Advertisement
“ I write what I write on Wikipedia because it ’s open to all people to contribute , ” read a May 2007 posting .
“ Do n’t read what you do n’t want to see .
You could have stopped reading this long ago but yet , you still continue to read . ”
Some parents thought the school should have detected the threats earlier ; others blamed Wikipedia for not reporting or taking them down sooner .
“ Places like Wikipedia that are public have some responsibility , whether they were joking around or not -- there ’s a responsibility for public safety , ” said Cindy Greenup , the mother of a Wilson freshman .
Parents and students cannot be expected to police the sites alone , said Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Det. Dan Jackson .
Advertisement
“ How do you make them accountable for policing it ?
It ’s pretty much impossible , ” he said .
“ Somebody with authority , like the administrator , should be monitoring it ” and reporting threats to police , because “ we certainly ca n’t cruise the Internet on thousands of sites . ”
But some Internet experts say volunteers like those at Wikipedia ca n’t be expected to be that hyper-vigilant .
“ The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were not written with the idea of Wikipedia in mind , and so we have to make this stuff up as we go along , ” said Peter Lunenfeld , a professor in the media design program at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena .
Lunenfeld said parents needed to be the ultimate online watchdogs .
Advertisement
A quick response to school Internet threats often depends on getting parents , students and site administrators to immediately report them to authorities , said Michael Bowman , Los Angeles school police deputy chief , who is called to investigate such threats about every other month .
Online records show that for more than a year Wikipedia administrators and at least one student were removing messages from the Wilson High page that had been posted by the same e-mail address as the recent threats .
But the student who removed the messages never notified school officials .
“ At first I thought it was just some hate letter , but as much of them surfaced , I started to question the motives of the poster , ” the student , a senior who plans to become a computer science major , wrote in an e-mail last week .
On Monday , he and others who have been monitoring the page were still debating in the “ discussion ” area whether the page history should include references to the shooting threats .
Advertisement
Wikipedia staff members said they did their best to respond to potential threats , but that it was difficult to separate them from pranks .
“ If someone came to us and told us we think there are threats here , we think there ’s a risk , we would go to the authorities , ” said Jay Walsh , a Wikimedia spokesman .
But we ’re “ not hugely equipped to trace people and see what they ’re doing . ”

Flock is an intriguing new " social web browser " that is designed not just as a portal to the web , but to your friends ' lives and the online communities where we share many of today 's experiences .
Launched with a 1.0 version based on Mozilla 's Firefox code base in 2005 , Flock has unveiled its first 2.0 beta that inherits all the performance and security enhancements in Firefox 3 .
Ars Technica goes hands - on with the Flock 2 beta to see what all the fuss is about .
In the beginning
Some browsers in recent years , like Opera , have incorporated other major functionality like e-mail clients .
Firefox , on the other hand , made a name for itself by fostering , among other things , a healthy add - on community that can add , well ... just about any feature you need .
Now , most of the major browsers like Internet Explorer , Firefox , and Safari all offer a fairly standard set of features .
The address bar and bookmark systems are now accompanied by basic RSS readers and password managers .
Out of the box , most browsers are fairly well - matched in the feature department .
Let there be Flock
Flock 2 flying its full colors , with a social networking bar on the left , a media bar at the top , and a blog post window ready to go .
Flock brings a new paradigm to interacting with the web .
Uniting the fundamental approaches of building in new features and allowing others to build whatever features they want , the Flock team designs with the idea that the web , for many users , has become an indispensable social platform .
We share our photos on Flickr , we microblog , share links , and let people know what we 're up to on Twitter and Facebook .
We watch a new breed of videographer unleash creativity on YouTube , we find interestingness at social news sites , and we blog it all to our personal sites to help our friends , family , and fans keep up on what 's new .
Flock incorporates a broad set of features for both watching what happens at these sites and creating content for them .
Upon first run on Windows , OS X , or Linux , Flock hits the ground running by inviting users to explore the social features and tools it has to offer .
While Flock is based on the Firefox code base , the most noticeable addition is a toolbar of socially - themed icons to the left of the bookmark bar .
This toolbar is perhaps the most important launching pad for Flock 's strengths as a social web browser , as it can open various sidebars and media bars that act as portals to services like Flickr , Twitter , del.icio.us , Blogger , YouTube Facebook , TypePad , Gmail , and more .
Flock reportedly can use virtually all of Firefox 's add - ons , and while I 'm not a heavy add - on user , I have n't run into an add - on that did n't work , at least with Flock 1 , in the past ( most add - ons are naturally disabled in Flock 2 due to its beta nature ) .
As you add your credentials for each of Flock 's supported communities , notifications of your friends ' activities appear in linear fashion in an all - encompassing People sidebar .
This becomes a centralized panel for not only viewing what your friends are up to across all these services , but also an integrated tool for interacting with them at these services .
An " action " button on each notification from a friend , regardless of the service , offers service - specific options for , say , sending a " shout " to a friend on Digg or " nudging " someone on Twitter who has n't updated in a while .
A Media bar can be displayed at the top of the browser area specifically for sifting through photos and videos from sites like Flickr and YouTube .
You can browse a specific friend 's media collection or public streams and Flickr 's popular " Interestingness " section .
You can click the thumbnail of a photo or video , easily copy its HTML link or embed code , or click to create a new blog post window inside of Flock with all the basic editing tools .
Browsing YouTube videos in Flock 's media bar .
Popup controls for each video allow for easy blog post embedding or copying HTML and embed code to the clipboard .
Flock also offers a photo uploader for its supported photo sharing sites which include Flickr , Photobucket , Picasa , and Piczo .
You can drag and drop images from your computer 's file system , then add basic metadata like titles , descriptions , and tags as you send your photos into the cloud .
An overlay appears on top of most photos and videos that makes it easy to blog or e-mail the media .
You can even follow up on whatever else the media 's creator has posted to the site it comes from .
Flock features a respectable blog editor that allows for easily posting just about anything you find on the web ( it is not , however , a blog manager ; you ca n't use Flock 's tools to view a list of posts or edit typos in posts you 've already published ) .
Photos from a web page can be dragged into a new post window .
Mousing over photos and embedded videos will present a small toolbar that allows for one - click creation of a new blog post with the media already inserted .
It 's a refreshingly integrated experience that makes Flock an appealing browser simply from a blogging standpoint .
Flock 's default " My World " homepage serves as a dashboard for your friends ' activity , RSS feeds , and media channels .
A fairly robust RSS reader allows for feeds to be categorized in groups , and you get some flexibility in how to view news items ( one or two columns , just headlines or excerpts , etc. ) .
Flock 's RSS reader is of course very well integrated with its other tools , allowing any news item to be blogged , saved , dugg , or e-mailed to a friend via webmail services like Gmail , Yahoo Mail , AOL Mail , or your desktop client .
No rest on the 7th day
As the Flock 2 beta is based on the shiny new Firefox 3 code base just released today , it inherits new features and stability while presenting some of the typical bugginess found in betas .
Probably Flock 2's most significant enhancement is Firefox 3's revolutionary and responsible memory management .
Since Flock is such a media - intensive browser , Flock 1.x can quickly gobble up 300 - 400 MB of RAM ( or more ) after just a couple hours of medium - to - heavy usage .
Browse your friends ' social timelines , peruse some photos at Flickr , open half a dozen tabs , and watch a YouTube video or two , and Flock 1.x joins nearly every other browser in hogging what has always felt like way , way too many CPU and RAM resources .
With Firefox 3 under the hood now , Flock 2 is a far more responsible resource citizen after heavy usage .
Flock 2 also feels generally snappier and more responsive , even on my comparatively slow MacBook Air with 2GB of RAM .
Firefox 3's other benefits , like the new bookmark system , enhanced security with color - coded notifications , and a phishing filter that ties into a Google database are all baked into Flock 2 as well .
All that said , though , Flock 2 naturally could use some extra polish in a number of areas .
It 's a beta , so some issues are exempt for now .
However , through my testing of using Flock as my primary browser , I 've run into three crashes and a number of UI issues , some of which seem to be left over from Flock 1 .
For example : the media bar can shrink only so far with the browser window , but it can't shrink past about 670 pixels ; the tools at the top of the media bar ram together and get left behind if the window is shrunk any further .
Considering that Flock makes heavy use of a left sidebar for many of its social features , there is n't much more room left to expand the browsing area if , like me , you want to be able to use another app alongside Flock .
To solve this issue , Flock could perhaps lock the window at the media bar 's minimum width , or dynamically roll some tools below the main toolbar when a user shrinks the window too far .
One thing about Flock 's People sidebar that bothers me in particular is the fact that updates for services like Twitter and Facebook are truncated to just the few words that will fit on a single line .
This is annoying from a usability standpoint as it forces the user to either mouseover the updates one by one and wait for a tooltip or , even worse , click through to the originating service to read everything in its entirety .
What 's the point of a birds - eye view People sidebar if users have to click over to a bunch of separate web pages to stay on top of what friends are doing ?
The beta has a few other minor issues which I can't harp on too long because , well , it 's a beta .
Text areas sometimes are unresponsive after a page finishes loading , and Flock sometimes hangs on loading for a slightly longer period than I expect , but that could also be a result of me using it on a slower notebook with a 4200 RPM hard drive .
Switching browsers for the first time
UI and beta nitpicking aside , I find myself seriously considering Flock as my main browser for the first time since it debuted in 2005 .
The Flock team built on Firefox 3 and got Flock 2 out in a surprisingly short amount of time , and having all these integrated social features at my fingertips with reliable , responsible performance is a breath of fresh browsing air .
I 've remained a Safari man at heart over the years because of its slim , zippy nature , but Flock 2 is the first feature - packed ( and fast ) browser I 've used that does n't drag my computer down with its extra baggage .
I tip my hat to the Flock team , as Flock 2 has already earned a place in my Dock .
Across the web , as far as I can tell , the reception for Bob Barr and his Presidential bid seems rather less than enthusiastic amongst libertarians , to say the least .
I understand , and even agree , with much of the reticence .
That being said , I hope he gets nominated , and grandly loses with a couple of million votes .
For a couple of months we all had the pleasure of witnessing Bergland 's “ cat- herding ” on a grand scale , and while the feline flock is somewhat reduced , the skill 's of the herder can't be underestimated .
That being said , Ron Paul is not going to be in any elected office other than his Congressional seat .
That 's just reality .
However , unless the national parties , entities that really should not exist in a free country , recognize that there is a real resonance for many of the principles that Paul advocates rather than a simple cult of personality somehow constructed around a septuagenarian physician , it will all be for nothing .
What does that mean ?
Well it means that there had better be an electoral showing for people who espouse similar views .
Polls are simply not sufficient .
At this moment , a unique opportunity exists to reform the old alliance between free market libertarians and the un-Hannitized remnants of old fashioned conservatism .
You know , the kind that believes in the economics of Adam Smith rather than Keynes , and the philosophy of Charles Lindberg on foreign policy rather than that of Leon Trotsky .
Honestly , Justin Raimondo does a far more eloquent job than I could ever hope to do of pointing out the relation between the blood - fetishism of today 's “ new ” conservatives and the pre-icepick delusions of ol '
Trotsky here .
How then does this relate to Mr. Barr ?
Well , if you think , as I do , that the only real point of the LP is the effort to educate folks on , well , freedom .
What is the best way of achieving this ?
Seems to me that the best way to pull this one off is to focus on those people who at least pay rhetorical tribute to individualism .
Those people are the old school conservatives .
End of story .
They believe in this , these are country people , they do n't call nine - eleven , and they do n't lock their doors when they are home .
That 's how you get down in the sticks .
Your conclusions are , honestly , likely accurate .
Guess what , most of those folks go to Church on Sunday .
That last sentence is usually a problem for libertarians , of the capitalized or lower case version , but frankly , that Bible is reserved for a Sunday late morning arsenal , rather than a week long thump .
In other words , just because you live out there does not mean that the Second Coming is imminent , or that all scientists are queer for chimps …. honestly , it more likely means that you have a better idea of the market price of Panama red than do even the higher echelons of the Bloods .
The Bible party does not even have enough cellulose to be called a paper tiger , it 's ephemeral , and thank's to the overblown , Stalinistic silliness over Obama 's preacher , open to a full summer 's worth of ridicule .
Let us pray .
Aaaamen .
Perhaps the Religious Right can finally be shown to be the odd aggregate of two dozen pedophiles and their , paying , flock .
The Bible says that vengeance is the province of the Lord , something rather difficult to discern from the bellicose ramblings of either Pastor Hagee , or Pat Robertson .
A fan of religious sanctimony I 'm not .
All of that being said , why deal with a guy like Bob Barr with his less than pure roots ?
Well to me , the entire point of the Libertarian Party is to educate the citizenry and expand the movement , such as it is .
Where , pray tell , is the best place to find people pre-disposed to freedom but in the former happy hunting ground of the GOP , rural Ameerica ?
Bob Barr is a guy those people can feel alright looking at , and even getting behind … all while a blue star hangs in the window .
Subtlety is worthwhile in this case .
There is a real chance for Liberty to get a toehold this election cycle , and that chance lies with Bob Barr , hate it or not .
The other thing that I would like to see in my lifetime is the destruction of the self imposed tyranny that is the two - party system in this country .
As far as I am concerned , anything that damages any part of either of our ruling houses is a good thing .
Bob Barr can put a pull , in the skeet sense , on the republican party , and perhaps expose their hypocrisy , and perhaps send the GOP the way of the Whigs .
Once the more corrupt , and weaker , party self - destructs , focus on the party of Marx .
Both must go , and both are vulnerable , but the Libertarians might be able to cause real harm to the GOP , and educate a few wayward conservatives along the way , and what 's wrong with that ?

My goal is to come home with my legs

Wednesday marks the five - year anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq , ordered by President George W. Bush .
A CBS affiliate in Miami reports on one mother , Christie Deminico , whose only child is stationed in Iraq .
Her 26 - year - old son , Bryan , has been in Iraq for nearly a year .
Only three weeks into his stay , his platoon was ambushed .
" That was their first taste of reality , " reflected DeMinico .
" Sadly , " said reporter Liv Davalos , " it 's a reality that families all over the county have experienced in the last five years of this war .
So far , nearly 4,000 Americans have died and nearly 60,000 have been injured . "
Many come home missing limbs .
Deminico , who helps collect letters and care packages to be sent to area troops in Iraq , says her son told her on the phone , " Mom , my goal is to come back with my legs . "
HENDERSON , Ky . 
A man who worked at a Henderson plastics company called his girlfriend from the plant about two hours before he fatally shot five people and then killed himself and told her that he was going to kill his supervisor , police officials said at a news conference on Wednesday .
The man , Wesley Neal Higdon , had been reprimanded for talking on his cell phone while working at the Atlantis Plastics plant and failing to wear safety glasses .
Earlier that evening , he had fought with a co-worker , Joshua Hinojosa .
His supervisor , Kevin Taylor , ordered him to leave the building about midnight Wednesday .
Outside , Mr. Higdon fatally shot Mr. Taylor , before going back inside and shooting four employees in the plant ’s break room , ” Sgt. John Nevels of the Henderson Police Department said at the news conference .
Mr. Higdon then tracked down Mr. Hinojosa in the factory and shot him in the head , before committing suicide .
Now that US customs agents have unfettered access to laptops and other electronic devices at borders , a coalition of travel groups , civil liberties advocates and technologists is calling on Congress to rein in the Department of Homeland Security 's search and seizure practices .
They 're also providing practical advice on how to prevent trade secrets and other sensitive data from being breached .
In a letter dated Thursday , the group , which includes the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , the American Civil Liberties Union and the Business Travel Coalition , called on the House Committee on Homeland Security to ensure searches are n't arbitrary or overly invasive .
They also urged the passage of legislation outlawing abusive searches .
The letter comes 10 days after a US appeals court ruled Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) agents have the right to rummage through electronic devices even if they have no reason to suspect the hardware holds illegal contents .
Not only are they free to view the files during passage ; they are also permitted to copy the entire contents of a device .
There are no stated policies about what can and can't be done with the data .
Over the past few months , several news reports have raised eyebrows after detailing border searches that involved electronic devices .
The best known of them is this story from The Washington Post , which recounted the experiences of individuals who were forced to reveal data on cell phones and laptop devices when passing through US borders .
One individual even reported some of the call history on her cell phone had been deleted .
" The Fourth Amendment protects us all against unreasonable government intrusions , " the letter , which was also signed by the Center for Democracy and Technology and security expert Bruce Schneier , states .
" But this guarantee means nothing if CBP can arbitrarily search and seize our digital information at the border and indefinitely store and reuse it . "
Several of the groups are also providing advice to US - bound travelers carrying electronic devices .
The Association of Corporate Travel Executives is encouraging members to remove photos , financial information and other personal data before leaving home .
This is good advice even if you 're not traveling to the US .
There is no reason to store five years worth of email on a portable machine .
In this posting , the EFF agrees that laptops , cell phones , digital cameras and other gizmos should be cleaned of any sensitive information .
Then , after passing through customs , travelers can download the data they need , work on it , transmit it back and then digitally destroy the files before returning .
The post also urges the use of strong encryption to scramble sensitive data , although it warns this approach is by no means perfect .
For one thing , CBP agents are free to deny entry to travelers who refuse to divulge their passwords .
They may also be able to seize the laptop .
If it sounds like a lot of work , consider this : so far , the federal government has refused to reveal any information about border searches , including what it does with the electronic data it seizes .
Under the circumstances , there 's no way of knowing what will happen to , say , source code or company memos that may get confiscated .
Or the email sent to your lawyer . ®
I 've been looking at Scala , OCaml , and F# recently and I 've really been struck by their different approaches toward mixing OO and FP .
I can't say that I like any particular approach , really .
OO and FP do seem to be odd bedfellows in a language and I think that I see why now .
They use syntax in rather different ways .
If you aim for one unified syntax in hybrid FP / OO languages the things that you do to tune the syntax toward one end seem to detune from the other .
Let 's take a look at how we structure function calls / applications across several languages :
C : a( b , c ) ;
Java : b.a( c ) ;
Smalltalk : b a : c
Lisp : ( a b c )
Haskell : a b c
The C syntax is a straight procedural .
We have a function a and we need to pass b and c along .
The Smalltalk snippet is in the object - oriented style .
We privilege b and say that it owns the a method .
We get polymorphic substitutability in the bargain .
Lisp does n't privilege any particular argument , so it is sort of like procedural , although people do write OO code in that style in Scheme and CLOS .
The Haskell example , however , is very interesting syntactically , because it is tuned to make this natural :
let x = a b in x c
In this example , we 've bound x to the partial application of a to b and then used it to form an expression x c which is semantically the same as a b c .
Partial function application is powerful .
People working in Haskell and the other ML - derived languages use it routinely to compose operations .
It 's a shame , though that its syntactic style is so different from the OO style .
Here 's an example that drives it home .
Imagine that we want to get the second element of a list in a couple of hypothetical languages .
Here 's a Haskell - ish way to do it :
head ( tail [ 1,2,3 ] )
and here 's the OO - ish way :
[ 1,2,3].tail.head
See the difference ?
FP is more of a prefix style , while OO is postfix .
One could say that this is arbitrary , that you could have an OO language which uses the prefix style , but I 'd argue that there is something deeper here .
Let 's imagine what our code would be like if we attempted to do partial function application with OO syntax .
let remainder = [ 1,2,3 ] . tail in remainder .
head
The partial function application does n't really buy us much here .
Partial application is powerful when it composes functions .
Often the data that we are working with is the least interesting thing to compose , yet it comes first in OO expressions and the natural style of partial function application in language design is to keep the first N terms and leave off some trailing ones .
It does seem that functional programming gets some advantages from its prefix syntax .
Scala , F# , and OCaml do show that you can mix the styles , but you can't really get a unified one without picking the prefix form or the postfix form .
The ML derived languages have definitely found a syntactic sweet spot and it does seem like it's a poor mix with object orientation .
Things are starting to get a little sticky here in Iowa ... or watery , I guess , would be more appropriate .

Treasuries have been on a bit of a rally recently as the Lehman iShares 20 + year duration treasury fund ( TLT ) chart shows .

The recent downtrend line has been broken .
Is the inflation scare over ?
That is hard to say .
It 's much easier to say is that it should be .
Destruction of credit via massive writedowns in banks and financials , accompanied by sharply rising unemployment rates , falling wages , and curtailment in credit lines everywhere is simply not an inflationary environment .
Of course , this all starts with a proper definition of inflation .
In Austrian economic terms , inflation is an expansion of money and credit .
Money is not expanding and neither is credit .
There is an illusion that they are as discussed in Bank Credit Is Contracting .
We have reached Peak Credit , a once in a lifetime event .
Those focused on the CPI , M3 , and other such measures are completely missing the boat .
Yes , the CPI is understated ( at least on the surface ) .
However those using CPI data to short treasuries over the past few years have had their heads handed to them .
OK there was a selloff from March to June , but seasonally this is an expected event .
April and May are typically the worst months ( tax season ) .
A warning shot was fired at the treasury bears today as circled above .
Will they heed the warning ?
Credit Deflation
Some choose to call what is happening " credit deflation " .
In this regard " credit " is an unnecessary label .
Deflation is about the contraction in money supply and credit .
The conditions now are very similar to what happened in 1929 .
The primary difference is that prices of many goods and services ( notably energy and food ) have been rising .
There are several reasons for this .
China and India are on a different credit cycle than the US .
Inflation in China is indeed rampant .
Just so that it is clear , I am talking about monetary inflation .
Monetary inflation is really the only kind , but confusion keeps cropping up so I spell it out .
China is printing Renminbi to buy US dollars .
The US dollar is falling because of budget monstrosities by this administration and both parties in Congress .
More Credit Writeoff Coming
above
A new report released by Clayton Fixed Income Services , Inc. on Wednesday afternoon found that 60 + day delinquency percentages and roll rates increased in every vintage during May among Alt - A loans , while cure rates have declined only for 2003 and 2007 vintages .
The picture being painted for Alt - A is increasingly beginning to look a whole lot like subprime , as a result , even if peaking resets in the loan class are n’t expected until the middle of next year .
In particular , loss severity continues to ratchet upward — a trend that portends some likely further reassessment of rating models at each of the major credit rating agencies , as they catch up with the data .
Those numbers make Standard & Poor ’s Ratings Services latest assumption of 35 percent loss severity on Alt - A loans , only one month old , already start to look a little too conservative .

Bombyx mori - the silkworms ' blog !
This is a photo - intensive , blow - by - blow description of my silkworm rearing .
If you want to read more information about the process , check out Serving the Tiny Masters .
When the mulberry tree looks like this , it 's time to take the worm eggs out of the fridge !
These catkins are quickly followed by the tender new leaves , the kind that the hatchling silkworms love to eat .
The Bombyx mori eggs were taken out of cold storage on March 17 .
I keep them in a special warm room that I use for drying my soaps ; any place that will stay at or above 72 ' or so will work , but they 'll grow faster and be healthier between 78 ' and 85 ' F .
Healthy eggs are plump and not dessicated .
If you look carefully , you can see the caterpillar curled inside some of the eggs .
The baby cats are curled head - to - tail like a letter C. Bombyx mori undergo diapause in the egg - similar to hibernation - they pass through the winter in a barely - alive state , and perk up when it gets warm again .
Because they 're so thoroughly domesticated , these two states are " in the refrigerator " and " out of the refrigerator . "
Here , you can see the sophisticated and classy egg - hatching setup .
Yes , it 's a salad container from a fast food place .
There are probably eight or nine hundred eggs here ; I just made a guess , selecting some from each of several different batches to ensure genetic diversity .
As they grow and need more space , they 'll be transferred to big deli trays with lids .
I keep a moistened piece of tissue in here , to keep the eggs from dehydrating .
Whether you need this or not will depend on your climate .
It 's essential that the eggs do n't get damp , or mold - if there is condensation on the inside of the lid , it 's too moist or the heat source is too direct .
March 17 , 2004 .
It typically takes 10 - 14 days for the eggs to start hatching .
It depends on several factors , including temperature , humidity , and the level of development before the eggs went into the fridge .
Apparently some of these were ahead of schedule , because they started hatching out in just 7 days .
March 24 , 2004 .
This is what the kegos look like REALLY close up .
I got a new camera , and I 'm working on re-shooting some of this information - so this is just a taste of the new zoom lens !
This caterpillar is about 2 mm. long .
These little guys have to start eating almost immediately , or they dry out and die .
You can see the tiny holes they 've chewed in the leaves .
The hatchling silkworms are called " kego " in Japan , or " chawki silkworm " in India .
" Kego " is translated on one Japanese website as " hairy baby " - they are covered with little black hairs .
Here , you can see the size of the hatchlings .
The first few usually hatch a day before , and then the mass hatching starts on the second or third day .
This makes Bombyx mori easy to rear , because they will go through all their various stages and change simultaneously .
Note that the unhatched eggs have a " blue " cast to them - this is because they will hatch soon .
Overall hatch rate on this batch was well over 90 % .
The brown staining on the paper was from the moth .
The mass hatching makes them look like a hill of ants ; a Chinese name for this stage is " ant silkworm . "
March 25 , 2004 .
This is the best way to move the kegos around .
This is a synthetic sable # 1 brush ; anything from a # 0 to a # 2 will work fine .
I find that they need to be " wiped " off the end to put them down on a new leaf .
Each worm makes a silk " safety line " and attaches itself to the leaf it's on ; that makes them easy to sweep up and move .
This is the third day .
The worms have more than doubled in size already .
Just above the center of the photo , you can see a tiny new - hatched worm ; compare its size to the ones around it , and you can see how much they 've grown !
Also , you 'll notice that instead of just nibbling holes in the leaves , they turn the leaves into lace .
The leaves are held together by the veins alone .
NOTE : Raising silkworms is a learning process for me .
I keep learning new things - so I 'll share them with additions as I go along .
I have found a much better way to clean the silkworm trays ; check out NETTING UP .
Added summer of 2005 .
Overall , though , they 're still quite small .
March 26 , 2004 .
A couple of days later , the kegos are changing their skins !
The second - instar worm at the top has already shifted his skin ; note the larger face plate and the gray coloring .
The worm below is about to change - you can tell because his white shiny skin looks too tight for his body .
His tiny face will be replaced by a much larger one , which will allow for faster eating and more growth !
These are second - instar worms with the dime for scale .
This worm has crawled off the leaves to change his skin .
I call this " praying " because he looks like he's in prayer or meditating - they sit with their heads lifted up , immobile , their legs folded before them , for hours or even a whole day .
When the worm steps out of its skin , it leaves it behind like this .
Imagine someone slipping out of their pants and just leaving them in a puddle on the floor .
March 28 , 2004
The worms are big enough now that I change them up to a larger tray .
This is the kind of tray that they will live in for the rest of their life cycle ; as they grow , I just split them out to additional trays .
This is a deli tray - if you 're not fortunate enough to work for a company that buys them to throw parties or treat the staff to cheese and fruit ( have I mentioned that I love my job ? ? ) see if you can talk your local grocery store deli counter out of two or three .
Otherwise , you can buy them at places like Sam's or a restaurant supply house .
The lid is n't really necessary , because the worms wo n't crawl far from the leaves until it 's time for them to spin - but it helps keep the leaves from drying out .
NOTE : I have since learned that it 's essential to put holes in the lids to ensure air exchange and prevent mold and disease .
I cut out some of the little raised sections along the side , and put 4 to 8 holes in each lid .
To make the cleanup easier , I line the trays with a piece of freezer paper folded and cut into a circle .
When I transfer the worms , I do it by picking up the leaves they 're eating and moving leaves , worms , and all to the new tray .
This allows me to leave behind the older leaves beneath .
I find that I can build up 3 to 5 layers of leaves before they start to get moldy and nasty beneath ; it varies depending on temperature and humidity .
Individual worms that are left behind on the litter can be picked up * very gently * with tweezers or forceps , or with a paintbrush .
It 's easy to crush them if you use your fingers .
NOTE : Check out NETTING UP for a faster and easier method to move the worms off their old bedding .
With the netting , I do n't use the freezer paper .
This is the amount of leaves they 're eating right now .
It 's about 4 pieces of branch , each a foot or so long and only as thick as a pencil .
The basic idea is to have enough leaves to entirely cover the worms ; imagine covering a pizza entirely with pepperoni slices .
If you put leaves a few inches away from a worm , it 's a dead worm .
This is what they look like once they 've been fed .
After this , they 're good for another 6 to 8 hours .
The more you feed them , the faster they grow .
I usually feed them first thing in the morning , at lunch , after work , and before bed .
They do n't need feeding during the night , although I 'm sure they 'd appreciate it .
March 28 , 2004 .
The worms have now begun to change into the third instar .
This one is waiting for the skin to split ... he will walk out of his skin after shrugging off his old face for the new one .
March 31 , 2004 .
Here , you can see a worm that has just shed its second skin .
Note that the head is large and gray ; it will darken over the next few hours .
You can see the shed skin behind it - the worms attach their claspers to the surface , and just wiggle forward out of the skin to shed it .
Here , you can see the shed skin more clearly .
In this shot , you can see the second - instar face hanging from the jaws of the third - instar face .
The faces pop off like masks .
For scale .
The worms are getting bigger by the day .
And today , I split them into two trays .
The ideal is to have 1/3 of the surface space of the leaves occupied by worms ; when they get large enough that they do n't have room to turn around comfortably , it 's time for a bigger tray .
Fortunately , these deli trays stack on top of one another , so the extra space just means more height .
Feeding time is a bit of a juggling act , and the trays end up spread out across the cabinet , but they store quite neatly between feedings .
March 31 .
Today , the worms have started changing into the fourth instar .
This change , like the ones before , means a bigger skin , a bigger face , and more food .
April 2 .
There are several things to see in this photo .
The worm in the center is about to change ; it is going through the period of rest before slipping its skin .
On the lower left side of the photo you can see a slipped skin - they are larger now , and very noticeable .
On the right you can see a new fourth - instar worm , with the much larger head .
And center top , there is a worm that failed to make the change .
If they are disturbed during the changing process , whether by human hands , or by other worms knocking them over , it can cause them to get stuck and die .
This worm is still wiggly , but will most likely be dead within a day .
If you have worms that get sick , turn dark , become limp , or ooze any fluid from either end , they * must * be removed immediately from the other worms .
If you feel like the little guy would recover if you only gave him a chance , you can put him into a tiny " hospital " tray with his own leaf .
Sometimes they do go ahead and recover .
Most times , they die .
There are bacterial and viral diseases of silkworms that can wipe out an entire crop very quickly .
Hygeine is the most effective thing that to prevent disease from spreading .
Make sure to wash your hands after touching any sickly worm , and after cleaning up the trays .
April 2 , 2004 .
At this point , the worms are large enough to handle gently by hand , instead of lifting the whole leaves .
I usually count the worms when they enter the fourth instar ; when I change their trays , I put ten at a time onto leaves , and transfer them to new trays .
The size of trays that I use , 200 fourth - instar worms fit comfortably onto one tray , so that 's 20 leaves with 10 worms each .
This year , I have about 750 worms .
Here , you can see the 200 worms on the tray .
This is good spacing - they are not crowded , and have plenty of room to move around .
Each worm should have three times as much floor space as it needs sitting still .
April 2 , 2004 .
The fourth instar worms keep growing .
Here are some of the worms off the leaves for cleaning - time .
I skipped the stage of putting 10 on a leaf , because it 's faster this way .
The dime shows that they 're continuing to get bigger by the day ; the largest ones are about 1 3/ 4 inches long .
You may notice that some of the worms , particularly one just to the left of the dime , and one in the upper left corner , are standing up on their hindlegs ; unfortunately , because this is a still picture , you can't see that they 're doing the Food Dance !
They wave their entire upper bodies around in a wide circle , almost brushing the paper in front .
They do this until food falls on them .
If they do n't touch any food after a few circles , they move forward a couple of steps and try again .
This is because they are so thoroughly domesticated ; the wilder types of caterpillar do n't mind walking a little ways for food , and do n't always expect it to be served up .
April 5 , 2004
And here 's one of the four trays .
The trays stack upward , so they do n't take up much counter space , except at feeding time .
Another thing that becomes really noticeable at this stage is the sound of the silkworms .
They make a noise similar to rain on the roof , or a huge bowl of Rice Crispies .
Some sources will say that it 's the sound of them eating , but it 's actually mostly the sound of their claspers as they move - they make the sound even without leaves .
Five or six worms in a dish will be distinctly audible , but when you open up 4 trays to feed them , it 's as loud in the room as if it were actually raining outside .
It 's a very peaceful , soothing white noise .
It 's even louder as they get bigger .
April 5 , 2004 .
Today , the worms started changing to the fifth instar .
You can see this one in the center stepping out of his skin .
The change starts with a shrugging motion repeated several times , and then the worm starts to wiggle forward out of the old skin .
The new head is much larger than the fourth instar's ; I call this the Turbo High Speed Eating Head .
Silkworms eat almost 90 % of their total intake during the fifth instar , so that means that they will eat nine times as much in the next week as they have eaten , total , over the past three weeks .
It becomes a busy chore keeping them fed .
Right now , they 're eating this much mulberry three or four times a day .
This is three branches with a diameter at the base of about an inch .
This will triple or more over the next few days .
As soon as the worms are done with the change , they will be transferred from 4 trays to 8 .
April 9 .
These two worms are doing totally different things .
The one in back is in the " Prayer Position " waiting for its skin to split ; the worm in the front is waving its head around looking for food .
It is important not to disturb worms when they are in the Prayer Position , because it can interfere with their changing of skins .
When the worm is getting ready to change , it spins a little pad of silk and attaches its claspers onto it ; then when it is ready , it wriggles and walks forward , leaving the skin attached to the silk pad .
If you pick up a worm in this stage , you will hear a ripping sound as the silk is pulled free - sometimes the silk comes up with the worm , sometimes the worm loses its grip on the silk .
Either way , it can make it difficult for the worm to shed its skin .
If the majority of the worms are in the Prayer Position waiting to change , you can skip a feeding or two to help them out - if there is a mix of hungry worms and resting worms , just feed lightly so that the resting ones do n't get covered with leaves .
This is what happens when a worm gets stuck in its skin .
This happens even with the most carful handling ; other worms walk across the worms that are trying to change , and knock them off their pads .
Most often , I find that I have accidentally moved a worm that was n't ready to move .
Since the worm breathes through its spiracles ( the black dots along its sides ) , it needs to shed its skin fairly quickly to avoid suffocation .
This worm is in my " hospital tray " - notice that the worms behind it are a kind of rusty brown color .
They will typically continue to darken , and eventually die , but sometimes they recover and can rejoin the others .
Sometimes you can gently " peel " a worm that has gotten stuck in its skin ; you have to be very careful to avoid ripping its delicate new skin .
The old skin peels all the way off like a sock .
This is a full - grown fifth - instar larva .
In this stretched - out position , it is two and a half inches long .
It will eat voraciously , making lots of protein to spin its cocoon from and storing up fat for its pupation and its life as a moth .
This year , for some unknown reason , I ended up with some white - faced worms .
They do n't have the usual black brow markings that the regular kind have .
I know that there are different races of silkworms , and this may be a throwback to some previous breeding in the line .
This worm has the usual pattern of markings .
The bulge behind its head will get bigger and bigger over the next week or so as it fills with silk protein .
This is n't how I usually feed the worms , but I love this demonstration of their eating speed .
These photos were taken at five minute intervals .
The worms attack the leaf from all sides ...
Within minutes , they will have reduced the huge leaf to mere veins .
Kind of like ... Vegetarian piranha .
Total time elapsed : 30 minutes April 9 , 2004
This is the current setup of trays .
I like them because they stack up - it 's still a significant amount of space required at feeding time , but at least they put away into a neat pile .
April 11 , 2004 .
The worms have begun to spin .
The worms stop eating and go into a rest , like when they are going to shed , but instead they dump out the undigested food in their gut , and start to wander and spin silk thread everywhere they go .
The worm in the front has changed over and started to spin ; the worm behind it has n't yet .
Note how much smaller the worm in front is - they lose a lot of size when they make the change .
They also develop a translucent yellowish shade that the camera can't quite pick up - they look a little waxy , and the greenish hue ( caused by the mulberry leaves inside ! ) that they usually have , disappears .
The gut dump is something I was n't prepared for the first time ; none of the sources I read mentioned it .
Some times it 's just a loose green version of their regular frass ; other times it 's a wet nasty splat .
If caterpillars do this any other time except when they 're getting ready to cocoon , they 're sick and should be isolated from the brood .
After dumping its gut , the silk worm will never eat again ; it lives off of stored fat through its entire spinning , pupation , and adult life .
The worms will wander around , and find a space to spin .
Ideally , they want a close environment ; they will spin up in the leaves , if you let them .
Their second choice is in the lid of the top of the tray .
Either of these locations tends to lead to slightly irregular cocoons ; it 's best to put them into a dedicated space to spin .
I use toilet paper tubes , although when I had a thousand worms cocooning at once in 2002 , I made bushes from the discarded mulberry branches .
This is the only time that the worms will entirely leave their trays if they 're not covered - if you raise them in a box or aquarium , you could find worms up in the corners of the room or in your drapes .
This worm has begun spinning the " flossing " of his cocoon - this forms the framework that will support the cocoon , sort of like a hammock .
This silk is slightly thicker than the reelable filament , and is not continuous .
It is used in making spun silk thread , and is called cocoon strippings , blaze , or keba .
The worm will spin non -stop for up to three days before shifting its final skin and becoming a pupa .
The worm waves back and forth to spin the flossing , but once it gets the framework set up , it will make a slow , deliberate figure - 8 motion with its head , thousands and thousands of times .
After a couple of hours , the cocoon is dense enough that you can no longer easily see the worm at work .
But if you hold the cocoon up to a strong light , you can see through the cocoon - at least for several hours , before it becomes totally opaque .
April 11 , 2004 .
April 15 .
The worms have begun spinning in earnest .
It 's like an avalanche - the first few days , it 's two or three each day - then , all of a sudden , dozens and dozens each time I check .
When the worms crawl upward onto the tray lid , or start to spin up in a leaf , I transfer them to the tray full of tubes .
The tubes are stacked end - upward like a honeycomb , providing a perfect little space for each worm .
You can cover it with the bottom of the tray , if they are adventurous .
Once the worms have a good start , each tray can accommodate a second worm , inserted at the bottom - do n't put it above the worm in progress , or it may stain the cocoon with its droppings .
This is the full tray .
There will eventually be about 4 of these ; each one will hold about a hundred tubes , which can be doubled up to hold 200 worms .
Once the cocoons are firm and opaque , you can pull them out to make space for more .
The worms generally wo n't crawl out of a tray like this ( the plastic edges are forbidding , and they never want to crawl down ... ) but I would n't lean them against a wall or drapery .
April 15 , 2004 .
NOTE : The following section describes the processing of the cocoons to kill the pupae inside .
If this troubles you , please do n't read it .
This is the crop of cocoons .
The very largest and finest cocoons are saved for breeding , but the remainder are stifled ( killed ) to prevent the moth from hatching and destroying the silk .
Cocoons should be stifled after the worms have changed to pupae ( about 6 days after the start of spinning ) but before the moths would begin to hatch ( about 2 weeks after spinning ) .
Hatched cocoons can be used for spun silk , but are no longer useful for reeling .
Reeling produces the most regular , lustrous , and desirable silk .
April 21 , 2004 .
First , the blaze is separated from the cocoons .
This is the first thread that the worm spins when beginning the cocoon .
It is called cocoon strippings , blaze , floss , or keba .
It is useful in making spun silk .
Any cocoons that are soft , stained , or irregular are sorted out .
Some will be discarded , others will be added to the silk used for spinning .
The way that I prefer to stifle the cocoons is to bake them in a 180 'F oven for 30 - 40 minutes , and repeat the treatment a couple of times over two or three days to fully dry the cocoons .
If your oven wo n't go below 200 'F , be careful that the cocoons do n't scorch .
It is also possible to freeze the cocoons to stifle them , or to place them in hot sunshine .
The reason that I prefer the oven , is that it dries out the pupae so that they will not rot and smell bad .
They do tend to smell , but the smell of the under - baked ones is really rank .
If you choose freezing , make sure to keep them frozen until it 's time to reel them .
For information on how to reel the silk , click here .
April 21 , 2004 .
The stifled cocoons should be stored in mesh or fabric bags , not in sealed plastic , to help prevent molding .
May 4 , 2004 .
The first signs that a cocoon is about to hatch , is that it will become wet on one end , and often rock back and forth .
The wet spot is from an enzyme called cocoonase which the moth squirts out of its head to partially dissolve the cocoon threads .
Cocoons usually hatch at dawn , and usually about two weeks after the start of spinning .
After much struggle , the moth will begin to push its way out through the damp spot on the cocoon .
The moth will emerge damp and bedraggled looking .
The moth wiggles its way slowly out .
The process is complex ; first , it pushes forward with its head , then , it swells up the sections of its body one at a time , slowly moving forward .
Eventually , the moth pulls free of the cocoon .
They will often grab on to an adjacent cocoon , or climb up the side of their own ; I provided my finger to give the moth something to grab onto .
This moth is a female ; you can see her abdomen is distended with yellow eggs , which you can actually see through her skin in between the furred stripes .
The female will rest on the cocoon , and spread out her wings .
Yup , those wings there are spread already ; sometimes they get a little bigger , but not much .
Because the moths have been bred for domesticity for thousands of years , the moths never fly , and the wings are essentially vestigial .
The males will buzz their wings sometimes and stomp around , but none of them can manage even a short flight .
The females are so big with eggs , they can barely walk .
This moth is a male .
You can tell by the much smaller body .
Other than the female 's huge egg - laden abdomen , the two sexes are very similar .
Males often have more normal - appearing wings .
Not long after she emerges , the female will begin to scent .
She sticks out a special gland from her abdomen which exudes a pheromone .
Many of the Saturniid moths wait until dark , or even the following day , to scent ; Bombyx moths scent usually within seconds of emergence .
The males are unable to fly , but the pheremone drives them crazy , and they buzz their useless wings and walk excitedly around .
It 's actually kind of comical .
The male moths are driven wild by the pheremones .
They will try to mate with anything even vaguely moth - sized , including cocoons and each another .
The brown stains behind the moth are from the fluid that the moths squirt out from their bodies - they 're especially likely to squirt when excited or startled .
It 's called meconium .
The moths use the fluid to inflate their limp wings after they emerge ; once the wings have hardened , they withdraw the fluid and secrete it as waste .
Here 's a photo of the antennae in mega - close - up .
Also , notice that there is no proboscis - the adult moths have no mouths , and cannot eat .
Once he finally finds the female , the male grasps her by the abdomen , and they settle down .
The males flap their wings in short bursts for a while , and then stop altogether .
They will remain paired like this for twelve to twenty - four hours .
They can be safely separated after three hours , because the male will have inseminated the female .
If you choose to separate them , grasp each moth gently by the wings , and twist them apart like removing a key from a lock .
If you are n't careful , you can damage the female 's ovipositor , causing her trouble laying eggs .
A single male can be reused for an additional 1 to 2 matings .
In order to control the pairings , I place pairs of moths under plastic cups .
This also helps keep the pattern of egg laying neat and clean .
After mating for 12 to 24 hours , the pair will separate , and the female will begin to lay her eggs .
Most females will lay between 150 and 300 eggs over the course of two to three days .
Some moths can lay as many as a thousand .
The eggs start out lemon yellow , and over a day or two will fade through tan to dark gray or black .
If they do not change colors , the eggs are likely infertile .
After they change to dark gray , they can be placed into cold storage .
The most convenient way is to trim the paper into colony - sized circles , and place them inside a jar or freezer bag , and put them in the door or a crisper drawer .
The main body of the refrigerator can get too cold for them ; ideal temperature is between 35 'F and 40 'F .
If the eggs are not refrigerated , sometimes they will hatch , and other times they will just dry up and die .

The Ford Focus ECOnetic has been named WhatGreenCar 's 2008 green car of the year , beating advanced technology from BMW and low emissions from Volkwagen .
Judge Ben
Lane talks through the winning and shortlisted cars here and explains the choice in his blog
With petrol prices continuing to rise , sales of SUVs are slowing and car buyers are looking for leaner machines .
But in the first WhatGreenCar ? car of the year award likely contenders such as the BMW 118d , with its EfficientDynamics stop - start and regenerative braking technology , and the ultra - low emission VW Polo BlueMotion 1 have been beaten by an altogether more familiar name – the Ford Focus , with its 1.6 TDCi ECOnetic version .
Ben Lane , WhatGreenCar ?
managing editor and award judge , explains why and talks us through the shortlisted cars .
Winner
Ford Focus ECOnetic
FORD Focus 1.6 TDCi ECOnetic
Category : Family
Lifetime impact rating : 33/100 ( 0 best , 100 worst )
CO2 : 115 g/km
This Focus is the first model in the diesel ECOnetic range , the name Ford has given to its new range of low CO2 models that will be rolled out to the Mondeo later this year and the Fiesta in 2009 .
The engineering behind ECOnetic includes recalibrated engine management and power steering system , and an improved aero - profile ( the car is almost 1 cm closer to the ground compared with a regular Focus , has a lower grille and new front bumper skirt , a rear spoiler and slimmer tyres ) .
The emissions improvements are achieved without fitting longer gear ratios ( as adopted by the VW BlueMotion and BMW EfficientDynamics models ) .
The results of these changes for the Focus ECOnetic 109PS is CO2 emissions of only 115g / km ( 65.6 mpg on a combined test cycle ) and an impact rating lower than the bench - mark Prius hybrid .
Priced from £ 16,050 , the Focus ECOnetic slots into the Focus range between the Studio / Style versions and top end Zetec / Titanium models .
Highly commended
BMW 118d
BMW 118d Saloon
Category : Family
Lifetime impact rating : 34/100
CO2 : 119 g/km
The 118d earns its green badge by adopting BMW 's EfficientDynamics technology package aimed at cutting emissions while maintaining performance .
For the 118d , this includes a new optimised four - cylinder common - rail diesel engines , regenerative brakes that recharge the battery on braking and reduce fuel consumption by up to 7 % ( the 118d is the first model in the BMW range to use this technology ) , and an Auto Stop Start Function which cuts out the engine when in neutral .
Together with an " optimum shift point indicator " ( better known as an " econometer " which tells you the optimum point to change gear to keep emissions down ) , these innovations result in increased output , reduced fuel consumption , and significantly lowered CO2 emissions .
For the 143 bhp 118d , CO2 emissions are among the best - in - class at 119 g/ km CO2 ( 62.8 mpg combined test ) , while performance is an impressive 0 to 100 km/h in 8.9 seconds .
The EfficientDynamics technology employed by the 118d led in March this year to the car being declared the 2008 World Green Car. From £ 18,350 .
VW Polo BlueMotion
VW Polo 1.4 BlueMotion 1
Category : Supermini
Lifetime impact rating : 29/100
CO2 : 99 g/km
The first model to be launched under its BlueMotion badge , this is in essence a stripped - down version of the standard diesel model ( no air conditioning or central locking etc ) and is fitted with a 1.4 - litre three - cylinder turbo diesel engine .
To reduce environmental impact , a particulate filter and improved oxidation catalytic converter have been fitted .
The gearbox has also been given longer ratios to maximise fuel consumption , even at motorway speeds .
The aerodynamics have also been improved through the use of a new smooth grille and revised front spoiler , smaller door mirrors , subtle side skirts and a rear boot spoiler to reduce drag .
The model is also fitted with lower rolling resistance tyres mounted on specially designed alloy wheels .
The result is very impressive combined test fuel economy ( 74 . 3 mpg ) and carbon emissions of only 99 g/ km , which means there 's no road tax to pay on the car .
However , the 78 bhp unit will still give 110 mph and a 0 - 62 mph time of 12.8 seconds .
From £ 12,120 .
Other shortlisted cars
NICE Mega City
NICE Mega City
Category : City car
Lifetime impact rating : 6/100
CO2 : 0g/km
On the surface , the Mega City electric vehicle looks like any other small city car .
Apart from the almost silent running , most people would n't know that there was n't an internal combustion engine under the bonnet .
With a top speed of 40 mph and range of only around 50 miles , the Mega may not compare well with conventional cars for driving performance , but as one of the greenest 4 - wheelers available in the UK its green credentials are unbeatable .
Built with an aluminium frame clad in ABS plastic and glass , the Mega is also fully recyclable .
The car comes in a two - seat / large load bay or four - seat configuration .
Twelve lead - acid batteries installed beneath the front seats power a 4 kW ( 5.4 hp ) motor housed under the bonnet , driving the front wheels .
A full recharge takes eight hours , but the batteries respond well to frequent top - up recharging .
Priced from £ 10,498 - with fuel costs of around 2 p per mile ( roughly 5 times cheaper than the fuel costs of similarly sized petrol cars ) .
Mini Cooper D
MINI Cooper D 108 bhp 1.6 litre diesel
Category : Supermini
Lifetime impact rating : 30/100
CO2 : 104 g/km
The revised low emissions model is now capable of an impressive 72.4mpg with , CO2 emissions of only 104g / km and it is one of the cleanest UK super - minis .
The Cooper D's high fuel economy is achieved in part by the use of Intelligent Alternator Control ( IAC ) and a regenerative braking system .
The engine also includes an auto start - stop function that switches the engine off when the vehicle is stationary and the driver puts the car into neutral - engaging the clutch restarts the engine .
The new model also includes a " switch point display " that recommends to the driver when to change gear to maximise fuel economy .
These new technological modifications to improve fuel efficiency are being rolled out across all the MINI model variants - the result is a 6.5 % fuel economy improvement for the MINI One , 6.9 % for the Cooper , 10.3 % for the Cooper S and 12.8 % for the Cooper D as compared to previous models .
From £ 14,420 .
VW Golf BlueMotion
VW Golf BlueMotion TDI
Lifetime impact rating : 34
CO2 : 119g/km
After the Polo , Passat Saloon and Passat Estate , the Golf is the fourth in the VW line - up to wear the BlueMotion badge , identifying it as the most economical model in the range .
The TDI 's 77 kW / 105 PS diesel engine provides a hefty 250 Nm of torque and the car requires just 4.5 litres fuel per 100 km ( 62.8 mpg combined , CO2 119 g/ km ) , 0.6 litres per 100 km less than the original model ( 55.3 mpg , CO2 135 g / km ) .
In common with others in the BlueMotion range , the emissions improvements have been achieved by the use of a recalibrated engine management system that reduces idling speed , a particulate filter , longer gear ratios , improved aerodynamic design , and low rolling resistance tyres .
The top speed is electronically limited 118 mph .
From £ 15,565 .
Fiat Bravo MultiJet
Fiat Bravo 1.6 MultiJet ECO
Category : Family
Lifetime impact rating : 34
CO2 : 119g/km
Available in either 105 bhp or 118 bhp variants , the 1.6 - litre direct injection common rail unit is a development of the 1.9 - litre engine created under a partnership with General Motors .
While the more powerful version directly replaces the 1.9 - litre 8 v diesel with the same power output , it 's the 105 bhp engine that is used across the majority of the Bravo diesel range .
Although the new ECO model shares the same power unit , it has longer gearing and an ECU set for low CO2 emissions of just 119 g/ km ( 62.7 mpg combined ) .
Although not quite Euro 5 compliant , our impact rating of 34 means this diesel just beats the Prius hybrid for overall environmental impact .
From £ 14,150 .
Toyota Prius
Toyota Prius
Category : Family
Lifetime impact rating : 35
CO2 : 104
There is n't much that has n't been said about the Prius , the world 's first and bestselling commercial hybrid car .
Since its launch in 1997 , the Prius has collected rave reviews and a loyal customer base - and has recently ( last month ) clocked up its 1 millionth global sale .
With the current model ( the Mark II ) Toyota has extended its market lead for hybrids , leaving most of its competitors behind .
Indeed it plans to hybridise its complete car range , and also will launch a new Prius model sometime in 2009 .
As you may already know , hybrids work by using a temporary energy storage device ( usually a battery ) , which enables the engine to be operated at close to its maximum efficiency .
For the Prius this means CO2 emissions of only 104 g/ km , a test fuel economy of 65.7 mpg ( combined ) , and a very respectable 0 to 62 mph in 10.9 seconds ( max Speed 106 mph ) .
From £ 17,780 .

Daytona Beach Homes Buyer Strategy Guide
At the end of January 2008 , there were over 6,600 homes and condos for sale in Daytona Beach , Florida and the surrounding area .
These are the homes for sale through the Daytona Beach MLS and the numbers do not include homes for sale by owner ( FSBO ) .
If you are trying to sell your home , this could be a disaster .
There is more competition than than ever and prices are falling .
The most recent information for 2007 shows a drop in home prices in the Daytona Beach / Ormond Beach / Deltona area of about 8.2 % ( See Daytona Beach Florida 2007 Home Prices ) .
The burning question for buyers
is how long these conditions will last .
This is the first in a series of articles that will address buyer ’s strategies for Daytona Beach Real Estate .
Why do You Need a Home Buying Strategy for Daytona Beach Real Estate ?
A strategy is needed in this real estate market because there are so many opportunities for buyers who approach the home buying process intelligently .
However , there are pitfalls that must be avoided in any market .
One of our main tenets in intelligent home or condo buying is :
The selection of a home is emotional , the negotation and buying process is business .
First Steps First
The first step that must be answered is :
What is our purpose in buying this property ?
Some of the possibilites include :
Primary residence
Second Home
Vacation Home
Investment Property
The next question to answer is :
Why are we engaging in the buying process NOW ?
This might include :
We need a bigger home
We need a place to get away from the nasty winters
To take advantage of the market
To buy low and sell higher when the market comes back
We love Daytona Beach and want to live here
When the answers to these two questions are clear you can begin the next phase of the process – Defining the criteria for the Daytona Beach home search .
Go to part two of Daytona Beach Real Estate Home Buyers Strategy Guide .
Who really thinks that the White House and the telecoms would go along with this so - called “ conditional immunity ” that congressional Democrats have agreed to if they did n’t think they could satisfy the condition ?
All they must do is provide a federal district court judge with “ substantial evidence ” they received a written request from the attorney general or head of an intelligence agency stating the president authorized the surveillance and determined it to be lawful , the Wall Street Journal reports .
How much clearer could they telegraph that such written requests exist ?
Late Update : Or as Laura Rozen puts it :
Does n’t that actually endorse and extend to private actors the Nixonian view that if the president says it ’s legal , it ’s legal , regardless of what the law says and the Constitution says ?
Would n’t that set an awful precedent that an administration could get private actors to do whatever they wanted including breaking the law ?
Later Update : Paul Kiel reminds me that the Senate intel committee already knows what those written requests say :
Scientists have made a breakthrough discovery in the bizarre properties of glass , which behaves at times like both a solid and a liquid .
The finding could lead to aircraft that look like Wonder Woman 's plane .
Such planes could have wings of glass or something called metallic glass , rather than being totally invisible .
The breakthrough involved solving the decades - old problem of just what glass is .
It has been known that that despite its solid appearance , glass and gels are actually in a " jammed " state of matter — somewhere between liquid and solid — that moves very slowly .
Like cars in a traffic jam , atoms in a glass are in something like suspended animation , unable to reach their destination because the route is blocked by their neighbors .
So even though glass is a hard substance , it never quite becomes a proper solid , according to chemists and materials scientists .
Work so far has concentrated on trying to understand the traffic jam , but now Paddy Royall from the University of Bristol , with colleagues in Canberra and Tokyo , has shown that glass fails to be a solid due to the special atomic structures that form in a glass when it cools .
Icosahedron jams
Some materials crystallize as they cool , arranging their atoms into a highly regular pattern called a lattice , Royall said , but although glass " wants " to be a crystal , as it cools the atoms become jammed in a nearly random arrangement , preventing it from forming a regular lattice .
In the 1950s , Sir Charles Frank in the Physics Department at Bristol suggested that the arrangement of the " jam " should form what is known as an icosahedron , but at the time he was unable to prove it .
An icosahedron is like a 3 - D pentagon , and just as you cannot tile a floor with pentagons , you cannot fill 3 - D space with icosahedrons , Royall explained .
That is , you can't make a lattice out of pentagons .
When it comes to glass , Frank thought , there is a competition between crystal formation and pentagons that prevents the construction of a crystal .
If you cool a liquid down and it makes a lot of pentagons and the pentagons survive , the crystal cannot form .
It turns out that Frank was right , Royall said , and his team proved this experimentally .
You can't watch what happens to atoms as they cool because they are too small , so Royall and his colleagues used special particles called colloids that mimic atoms , but are large enough to be visible using state - of - the - art microscopy .
The team cooled some down and watched what happened .
What they found was that the gel these particles formed also " wants " to be a crystal , but it fails to become one due to the formation of icosahedra - like structures — exactly as Frank had predicted .
" It is the formation of these structures that underlie jammed materials and explains why a glass is a glass and not a liquid — or a solid , " Royall said .
The findings are detailed in the June 22 issue of the journal Nature Materials .
The research was supported in part by a grant from the Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology as well as the Royal Society .
Preventing jetliner disasters
Knowing the structure formed by atoms as a glass cools represents a major breakthrough in the understanding of meta - stable materials and will allow further development of new strong yet light materials called metallic glasses , he said , already used to make some golf clubs .
This stuff is generally shiny black in color , not transparent , due to having a lot of free electrons ( think of mercury in an old thermometer ) .
Metals normally crystallize when they cool , however stress builds up along the boundaries between crystals , which can lead to metal failure .
For example , the world 's first jetliner , the British built De Havilland Comet , fell out of the sky due to metal failure .
When metals are be made to cool with the same internal structure as a glass and without crystal grain boundaries , they are less likely to fail , Royall said .
Metallic glasses could be suitable for a whole range of products , beyond golf clubs , that need to be flexible such as aircraft wings and engine parts , he said .
Glass is not what it seems
Royall is part of a group of scientists who think that if you wait long enough , perhaps billions of years , all glass will eventually crystallize into a true solid .
In other words , glass is not in an equilibrium state , ( although it appears that way to us during our limited lifetimes ) .
" This is not universally accepted , " Royall told LiveScience .
" Our work will go some way to making that point more accepted .
I think there is a growing weight of evidence that certainly many glasses ' want ' to be a crystal . "
Still , glass " looks like a liquid and this is one of the great riddles that we have gone some way to solving , " Royall said .
" It has always been thought that glass has same structure as a liquid , and that 's why it looks like it .
It does not have same structure as liquid . "

How does does Microsoft counter the widespread perception that Vista is a failure , despite its strong sales numbers ?
First you release a white paper explaining why Vista is better than XP , and then you release a white paper explaining why there is no reason to wait for Windows 7 .
With companies still considering " bypassing Vista , " Microsoft has done just that .
The most recent Windows white paper to make it out of Redmond is 20 pages long and is entitled " The Business Value of Windows Vista : Five reasons to deploy now . "
Microsoft 's argument focuses on the fact that Windows 7 will be much closer to Vista than Vista is to XP , and therefore it makes sense for businesses to ease up the transition process for themselves by moving to Vista first :
There is no need to wait for Windows 7 .
It is a goal of the Windows 7 release to minimize application compatibility for customers who have deployed Windows Vista since there was considerable kernel and device level innovation in Windows Vista .
The Windows 7 release is expected to have only minor changes in these areas .
Customers who are still using Windows XP when Windows 7 releases will have a similar application compatibility experience moving to Windows 7 as exists moving to Windows Vista from Windows XP .
The rest of the report centers on Vista features and how they are such a great improvement over XP .
Those parts are very similar to another report released by Microsoft that focused on convincing businesses that it is not worth waiting for SP1 before moving to Vista : " The Business Case for Windows Vista : Five reasons to deploy now . "
Whatever your opinion on Vista , there 's no getting around the fact that businesses have n't been adopting it as quickly as Microsoft would want .
White papers like this one are often an interesting read ( as long as you remember what the source is ) , but I can't help but wonder what else Microsoft can do to fight the media 's frequent criticism of Vista .

There are many factors behind the sharp increase in the oil price , but one is usually overlooked : it 's a bubble .
Where bubbles appear in the market ( think of housing and tech stocks , to name two in recent memory ) , you will find the hidden hand of monetary policy at work .
This is an underlying issue that helps explain the price .
Recognizing this also helps us make a better judgment concerning the future of the oil price as it relates to overall economic well - being .
According to the Fed 's minutes of its April 29 –30 monetary policy meeting , US central bank policy makers have turned more pessimistic on the growth of the economy .
The Fed is now forecasting that economic growth is likely to hover between 0.3 % and 1.2 % in 2008 — down from the 1.3 % to 2 % range , which was the Fed 's previous forecast .
The main reason for the lowering of the forecast is a sharp increase in commodity prices and in particular the price of oil , which Fed officials fear could ignite inflation expectations and lift the underlying rate of inflation .
On Friday , May 23 , the price of oil closed at around $ 132 / barrel .
The yearly rate of growth of the price of oil jumped to 106.3 % from 72.9 % in April .
According to the University of Michigan 's consumer survey inflation expectations one year ahead jumped to 5.2 % in May from 4.8 % in April and 3.3 % in May last year .
It is usually assumed that rising inflation undermines consumer 's real disposable income , which in turn weakens consumer spending .
Since spending is the major component of real GDP , real economic growth is obviously going to come under pressure , so it is held .
By this logic , if the price of oil were to continue to climb further , then at no time would Fed officials be forced to lower their forecast to negative growth .
Fed officials follow the Keynesian framework of thinking .
In this framework , spending by one individual creates income for another individual .
Hence the more people spend , the more income is generated .
( What causes economic growth is consumer spending , so it is held . )
Also , note that the source of a possible recession in this way of thinking is various shocks , such as an oil - price shock , that disrupts consumers ' ability to spend .
Most commentators are of the view that the presently observed sharp increases in the price of oil are on account of supply problems .
Existing oil fields are becoming depleted as time goes by while not enough new oil fields are being discovered .
Some other commentators blame the supply issue on US government restrictions on extracting oil from various areas in the United States for environmental reasons .
Without diminishing the importance of the supply factors , we suggest that another factor that must be considered is the contribution of the US central bank 's policies to the recent sharp increases in the price of oil .
Fed Policies and Market Bubbles
What makes it possible to generate the goods and services that people require to support their lives and well - being is the capital infrastructure of the economy and not spending by consumers as popular economics suggests .
It is the enhancement and the expansion of the infrastructure that permits an increase in the production of goods and services .
An improvement in the infrastructure makes economic growth possible .
The key factor that enables the improvement of the infrastructure is the flow of real savings that funds the enhancement of the infrastructure , i.e. , enables the production of various tools and machinery also called capital goods .
( With better tools and machinery , a better quality and a greater quantity of goods and services can be now produced . )
In a free unhampered market economy , the established infrastructure is in accordance with the tendency towards the harmony between various activities .
On this Murray Rothbard , paraphrasing Ludwig Lachmann , wrote ,
Capital is an intricate , delicate , interweaving structure of capital goods .
All of the delicate strands of this structure have to fit , and fit precisely , or else malinvestment occurs .
The free market is almost an automatic mechanism for such fitting ; … the free market , with its price system and profit - and - loss criteria , adjusts the output and variety of the different strands of production , preventing any one from getting long out of alignment .
This harmony gets disrupted by the monetary policies of the central bank .
An artificial lowering of interest rates by the Fed and the subsequent increase in the rate of growth of money supply gives rise to various nonproductive activities — bubble activities .
We define a bubble as the outcome of activities that have emerged on the back of the loose monetary policy of the central bank .
In the absence of monetary pumping , these activities would not have emerged .
As a result , the economy 's infrastructure gets distorted .
Various projects are undertaken that , prior to the artificial lowering of interest rates and increased monetary pumping , would not be considered .
The increase in money supply , which supports various new projects , sets the foundation for additional demand for various commodities , including oil .
More money is channeled toward commodities and oil .
Since the price of a good is the amount of money paid per unit of the good , this means that the prices of commodities and oil are now going up .
Once the central bank tightens its monetary stance , the diminished flow of money weakens the expansion in the bubble activities — an economic bust is emerging .
Observe that bubble activities are supported by means of loose monetary policy , which diverts real funding to them from wealth - generating activities .
Once the money rate of growth slows down , this slows the diversion of real wealth , i.e. , slows down the support for nonproductive activities .
As a result , the demand for various goods and services that emerged on the back of nonproductive activities comes under downward pressure .
Consequently , the prices of these goods , such as various commodities and oil , follow suit .
Following this line of thinking , we can suggest that there is a high likelihood that the massive increase in the price of oil that we are currently observing is the manifestation of a severe misallocation of resources — a large increase in nonproductive activities .
It is these activities that have laid the foundation for the oil - market bubble , which has become manifest in the explosive increase in the price of oil .
The root of the problem here is the Fed 's very loose monetary policy between January 2001 and June 2004 .
The federal funds rate target was lowered from 6.5 % to 1 % , while the money rate of growth had risen strongly .
Between Q3 2001 to Q4 2004 , the average yearly rate of growth of our monetary measure , TMS , stood at 7.5 % .
This should be contrasted with the rate of growth of 2 % in Q2 2001 and 0.8 % in Q4 2000 .
The easy monetary stance has given rise to various malinvestments , which we have labeled here as bubble activities .
From June 2004 to September 2007 , the Fed had been pursuing a tighter monetary policy .
The federal funds rate target was raised from 1 % to 5.25 % .
In response to this , the yearly rate of growth of our monetary measure TMS fell from 7.1 % in Q4 2004 to 0.4 % in Q1 this year .
Because of this sharp fall in the growth momentum of money supply , various nonproductive activities are currently coming under pressure .
This in turn should start hurting the prices of various commodities , including oil .
Regrettably , the loose monetary stance that the Fed has adopted since September of last year ( the federal funds rate was lowered from 5.25 % to 2 % ) , after a time lag , is likely to arrest the removal of various bubble activities and lay the foundation for the increased presence of these activities .
Obviously if the pool of real savings is shrinking — i.e. , the flow of real savings is no longer sufficient to support various existing and new activities — economic growth will come to a halt and commodity prices will come under downward pressure , notwithstanding the Fed 's aggressive lowering of interest rates since September of last year .
Now , it is not only the Fed 's policies that must be blamed for sharp increases in the price of oil but also the policies of other countries such as China .
Massive monetary pumping in China and the various structures that emerged on the back of monetary pumping there have contributed to the exaggerated increase in demand for various commodities , including oil .
For the time being , the pace of China 's nominal economic activity continues to push ahead .
We have estimated that the yearly rate of growth of nominal economic activity stood at 38 % in Q1 against 36 % in the previous quarter .
This , coupled with an upcoming effect of the loose Fed 's stance since September 2007 , is likely to mitigate the downward pressure on the price of oil , all other things being equal .
Conclusion
We suggest that there is a high likelihood that the massive increase in the price of oil is the manifestation of a severe misallocation of resources .
The loose monetary policy of the Fed from January 2001 to June 2004 is the likely key factor behind this misallocation .
( The federal funds rate was lowered from 6 % to 1 % . )
The tighter Fed stance from June 2004 to September 2007 should undermine the existence of various nonproductive activities and in turn reduce upward pressures on the price of oil .
Regrettably , the loose monetary stance that the Fed has adopted since September of last year , coupled with still very buoyant Chinese economic activity , is likely to counter any downward pressure on the price of oil .
The Fed 's current policy of fighting an emerging economic slump is , in fact , a policy of deepening the misallocation of resources , thereby promoting higher prices for oil .
If our thesis regarding the oil market bubble is valid , then it is the Fed 's policies that must be blamed for the erosion in consumers ' living standards and not the rising price of oil .

In favor of gun rights Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence : Supports gun control Enlarge By Jason Reed , Reuters Dick Anthony Heller , an armed security guard , sued the District of Columbia after it rejected his application to keep a handgun at his home .
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court 's historic decision Thursday carving out an individual right to gun ownership immediately cast doubt on gun restrictions nationwide , as firearms - rights advocates prepared to file a new round of lawsuits testing the scope of the ruling .
Hours after the momentous 5 - 4 ruling that struck down a ban on handguns in Washington , D.C. , gun rights supporters signaled they will challenge gun restrictions in cities and suburbs across the nation .
The majority opinion , written by Justice Antonin Scalia , established for the first time in U.S. history that the Constitution 's Second Amendment gives individuals the right to keep guns at home for self - defense .
Yet Scalia noted that a person 's right to gun ownership is not unlimited .
He said it would not likely override bans on concealed weapons ; laws that prohibit felons and the mentally ill from possessing firearms ; or those that ban firearms in government buildings and schools .
Beyond that , the court did not address what types of regulations would survive legal challenges .
It did not say , for example , whether people have a right to carry guns in their neighborhoods , or keep them in their cars on the way to and from work .
Nevertheless , Thursday 's ruling by the conservative - majority court represented a huge breakthrough for gun rights advocates who have long wanted the high court 's confirmation that the Second Amendment guarantees individuals — and not just government militias — the right to bear arms .
" This is big , " said Wayne LaPierre , the National Rifle Association 's executive vice president , who cast the ruling as " the opening salvo " in a series of planned legal challenges aimed at ensuring individual gun rights .
POLITICS BLOG : Candidates weigh in on decision VIDEO : High court strikes down D.C. gun ban Within days , he said , the NRA will file lawsuits against handgun restrictions in at least six cities : San Francisco , Chicago and the Illinois communities of Wilmette , Evanston , Oak Park and Morton Grove .
San Francisco bans guns in public housing .
The other five cities ban handgun ownership , with a few exceptions for police and other public safety officials .
Wilmette , Ill. , officials said Thursday that they would suspend the village 's 19 - year - old handgun ban until the village council could review the court 's ruling .
Wilmette counsel Timothy Frenzer said the last time a case was brought under the ordinance was in 2004 .
In Chicago , which has had a freeze on handgun registrations since 1982 , officials vowed to continue enforcing one of the nation 's strictest ordinances beyond the D.C. law the high court rejected .
" We do expect these legal challenges , " said Benna Ruth Solomon , Chicago 's deputy corporation counsel .
" But we will vigorously defend our ordinance . "
In announcing the court majority 's decision before rows of rapt spectators , Scalia stressed an inherent right of self - defense .
The ruling was signed by the court 's most conservative justices — Scalia , Chief Justice John Roberts , Anthony Kennedy , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito — and vehemently protested by the court 's more liberal members — John Paul Stevens , David Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer .
The decision bucked a trend among lower - court judges , who for decades have said the right " to bear arms " related to service in a militia and did not cover individuals .
At issue was the not - so - clear language of the Second Amendment : " A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . "
In his opinion , Scalia wrote , " The enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table .
Those include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self - defense in the home . "
Scalia noted that " handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self - defense in the home , and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid . "
ON DEADLINE : Latest developments in case D.C. GUN BAN : Read the court 's decision
The dissenting justices , led by Stevens , scoffed at the majority 's historical analysis of the Second Amendment .
" There is no indication that ( the amendment 's drafters ) intended to enshrine the common - law right of self - defense in the Constitution , " wrote Stevens , who took the rare step of reading from the bench .
He listed eight specific grounds on which he believed the majority was wrong .
Stevens warned the ruling would launch new judicial involvement in an issue he said should be left to legislators .
" I fear that the district 's policy choice may well be just the first of an unknown number of dominoes to be knocked off the table , " he wrote .
Disappointment in D.C. From D.C.'s city hall to the presidential campaign trail , the ruling stirred emotional responses from both sides of the gun debate .
A somber D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty said the decision would have consequences for " the entire country . "
He said that " more handguns in the District of Columbia will only lead to more handgun violence . "
Fenty said he was directing Police Chief Cathy Lanier to establish new regulations for handgun registration in anticipation of a wave of new gun purchases .
" We will continue vigorously enforcing the District 's other gun-control laws and are considering other ways to protect … citizens against the scourge of gun violence , " Lanier said .
The city also bans automatic and semi-automatic weapons ; laws that do n't appear to be affected by the ruling .
A short distance down Pennsylvania Avenue , President Bush issued a statement lauding the " historic " decision as " confirming what has always been clear in the Constitution : The Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear firearms . "
The Justice Department was " also pleased that the court recognized that , like other constitutional rights , that individual right is ' not unlimited , ' " spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said .
The presidential candidates also quickly issued statements supporting the court decision .
Yet both Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama had to deal with past comments that have put them at odds with gun owners .
McCain upbraided Obama for comments the Democrat made during the primary campaign .
" Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness , today 's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right — sacred , just as the right to free speech and assembly , " McCain said .
Obama said he had " always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms . "
However , he added : " I also identify with the need for crime - ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common - sense , effective safety measures . "
The McCain campaign called Obama 's position a flip - flop , distributing a long memo that included statements from him and his campaign in which Obama backed some gun-control measures and called the D.C. law constitutional .
In the past , however , McCain also has defied the NRA and other gun advocacy groups by lobbying for legislation that would have required background checks for buyers at gun shows .
Gun rights is a big issue in several key election states , including West Virginia , Pennsylvania , Ohio and Michigan .
Democrat Al Gore 's support of gun control in 2000 was widely seen as a reason he did not win West Virginia , Arkansas or his home state of Tennessee .
A broad view of ' militia '
The debate over gun rights — a topic that , like abortion and capital punishment , ignites passions — has long been waged in politics , public opinion and lower courts .
The Supreme Court last considered the reach of the Second Amendment in a 1939 case .
It did not rule definitively , but its decision was interpreted by a wide swath of lower - court judges to bar an individual right to guns .
Yet the popular notion of a right to arms persisted , as did gun rights advocates ' efforts to change the landscape as more conservative jurists took the federal bench .
Thursday 's case was brought by Dick Heller , a security guard who wanted a handgun in his Washington , D.C. , home for self - defense .
Heller had been turned down by D.C. officials under the city 's 1976 ban on handguns in the home .
Breaking with most past lower - court rulings , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last year sided with Heller and definitively declared an individual right to own guns .
Judge Laurence Silberman , a Ronald Reagan appointee , wrote the decision .
In affirming the D.C. Circuit 's ruling , the Scalia majority homed in on key words in the two parts of the Second Amendment : the preface that refers to " a well regulated militia " and the clause " the right of the people to keep and bear arms . "
One key to his ruling was Scalia 's interpretation of a " militia , " which traditionally is a unit outside the regular army and that today could be compared with state National Guard units .
He said it covered all able - bodied males acting for the common defense .
" The conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment 's ratification , " Scalia wrote , " was the body of all citizens capable of military service , who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty . "
He stressed that people carried arms outside of organized militias .
Beyond that , Scalia said , the preface puts no limits on the second clause referring to the right of the people to bear arms .
The dissenting justices complained about Scalia 's reasoning and the myriad questions left open by the ruling .
Stevens rejected the idea that the Second Amendment 's drafters wanted to limit legislative " authority to regulate private civilian uses of firearms " or intended to " enshrine the common - law right of self - defense in the Constitution . "
In a separate dissent , Breyer attacked the majority opinion for its lack of standards and its hurdles for officials trying to fight crime .
Breyer noted that handguns are involved in most firearms deaths and injuries in the United States .
" I can not understand how one can take from the elected branches of government the right to decide whether to insist upon a handgun - free urban populace in the city now facing a serious crime problem , " he wrote , criticizing the majority for casting uncertainty over what gun regulations would be permissible .
Scalia said the high court was n't providing the last word in the Second Amendment 's reach .
" Since this case represents this court 's first in - depth examination of the Second Amendment , one should not expect it to clarify the entire field , " he said .

It ’s time to revisit this months - old question .
( Some days it feels like “ age - old , ” but we do well to remind ourselves that “ subprime ” became a household word only quite recently . )
Mortgage underwriting is n’t really that difficult , which is of course why some of us have been so shocked at the extent to which lenders have been screwing it up in the last few years .
I do not mean to insult the professionalism or skills of mortgage underwriters , mind you .
Assessing credit quality , like a lot of other things , has become increasingly complex over the years as its constituent parts — the myriad ways people earn money , spend money , accumulate and put a value on assets , plus the changes in quality , quantity , and popularity of the many types of mortgageable real property , not to mention the legal issues that accompany those changes ( condominiums , PUDs , cooperatives , leaseholds , grandfathered zoning , flood hazards and insurance availability , etc. ) — have all become increasingly complex .
You have your days when encountering a borrower who earns a simple salary and keeps his money in a simple bank account and is buying a simple single - family detached home with no deed covenants in fee simple is kind of a refreshing change of pace .
Lending is never less complex than the economy that produces the money to pay it back or the extent of control we wish to exercise on land use .
That said , what it ’s about is just working through the complexity of the variations on three things that have been the core of mortgage underwriting since roughly the dawn of time : the three Cs , or Credit , Capacity , and Collateral .
Does the borrower ’s history establish creditworthiness , or the willingness to repay debt ?
Does the borrower ’s current income and expense situation ( and likely future prospects ) establish the capacity or ability to repay the debt ?
Does the house itself , the collateral for the loan , have sufficient value and marketability to protect the lender in the event that the debt is not repaid ?
There is no New Paradigm , there was no New Paradigm , there is not going to be a New Paradigm .
The Cs are the Cs . What we “ innovated ” was our willingness to believe that we had established the Cs with indirect or superficial measures ( that are , not coincidentally , cheap and fast compared to direct measures ) .
We looked at FICOs — scores produced by computers — instead of full credit reports and other documents to supplement them .
We looked at the borrower ’s statement of income or assets , not the documents ; when we got docs , we looked at the last paystub or the current balance of an account , not the documentation of a long enough period to establish stability of income or source of account balances .
We looked at AVMs instead of full field appraisals .
We read the Cliff ’s Notes .
These practices have not worked out so well , of course , but my point is that they were simply “ innovative ” ways of answering the three C questions , not new questions .
They ’re not a repeal of the laws of physics or the laws of the Cs .
They ’re just wrong ways to answer the right questions .
This is important to the question of what is subprime because people do wonder , quite understandably , what exactly the whole point of subprime lending ever was .
I ’m guessing a variant of this question has appeared in the comment section of this blog about a thousand times :
Why do people make loans to people who ca n’t pay them back ?
What did they think was going to happen ?
Is that like stupid , or what ?
What we call “ prime ” lending was based on the idea that all three C- questions had to get at least a minimally correct answer before proceeding .
You had to be sufficiently creditworthy and sufficiently capable and have sufficient collateral before we made the loan .
If you had , say , two out of three , you might qualify for a near - prime ( like FHA ) or subprime loan , depending on which two and by how far you missed the third .
There has only ever been one kind of ( mortgage ) lending that let you get one out of three — we usually call it “ hard money ” or “ collateral - dependent ” lending , as it is based solely on the value of the collateral — and regulated residential mortgage lenders have n’t been allowed to engage in it since approximately living memory goeth no further .
It ’s right up there with pawnshops , payday lenders , and vulture capital : a blight on society that we will always have with us as long as we have vulnerable people and unregulated “ entrepreneurs ” to pocket what little money they have .
“ Traditional ” subprime lending was about loans to people who had capacity but not creditworthiness or who had creditworthiness and capacity but not great collateral .
The first instance is the borrower who has defaulted on debts in the recent past , but who has sufficient income to carry a new debt ( for example , a borrower whose bankruptcy has been discharged , and whose income is now more in line with expenses ) .
The second instance , a large portion of traditional subprime lending , was loans for manufactured housing ( mobile homes ) , rural properties , urban mixed - use residential / commercial properties , and , of course , substandard housing in general .
These are properties that either cannot be properly valued as residential , or that are unlikely to maintain value over the life of a realistic loan term , or that , occasionally , simply appall a responsible mortgage lender who just does n’t want to participate in putting human beings into unsafe , unsanitary housing .
Yes , there were sometimes lines we would n’t cross .
Over most of its history , subprime lending was overwhelmingly refinance business .
That ’s why to this day a lot of people refer to it as “ home equity lending ” or HEL .
It began with the “ finance companies ” ( who were not depository lenders ) who usually offered second - lien mortgages to cash - strapped homeowners , including those who were having a hard time paying the mortgage they already had , which was most likely to have been originated as prime or near - prime , for a much higher interest rate than is typical for secured lending .
In the 90s , the go - go deal was the 125 % loan , which ended very badly .
The subprime lenders who originated first liens were still , on the whole , doing first - lien refinances , usually for cash out of some sort .
Often these were “ foreclosure bailouts ” or “ take - outs , ” where the cash taken out was just enough to pay off the past - due interest and fees owed to the original foreclosing lender .
Typically , these were fairly low - LTV loans : the borrower was too cash - constrained to make payments , but did not want to sell the home to avoid foreclosure .
A borrower with no or negative equity at all most frequently just mailed in the keys , then as now .
There was n’t then and is n’t now any inherent reason that these take - out loans were irrational from the borrower ’s perspective or the lender ’s .
Long - time homeowners do experience financial disruptions : job loss , illness , divorce , ninety days in the county clink for some regrettable excess of high spirits that one can think is unlikely to recur .
If the current lender ( the original “ prime ” lender ) wo n’t forbear or modify or otherwise play ball , the subprime lenders were there to structure a refi deal that would keep the borrower in the home .
For a hefty rate .
As long as it was plausibly a temporary or non-recurring problem , it was and is reasonable for this kind of lending to go on .
Some of us , in fact , have always believed that this particular kind of subprime lending would be a very good thing for regulated depositories and the GSEs to be into : the idea was that the loan terms would be standardized , the application practices supervised , the risk analyzed more carefully , the pricing appropriate but not usurious , the servicing careful and responsible , and hence the likelihood of total recovery — of the borrower being eligible down the road for a refinance back into a cheaper prime loan — would be increased .
Leaving “ bailout ” or “ rescue ” loans to the sharks and cowboys and fast - talkers has really not worked out so hot , especially once they learned that they could , with predatory lending tactics , create the crises that need the bailouts .
Of course , now that we ’ve thoroughly demonized “ subprime , ” the odds of getting the responsible regulated parties to take over the business are quite slim , as everyone is clamoring for them to stay away from it .
This is a problem .
Whatever else it was , subprime lending just was n’t much of a purchase - money business .
When it was , you had things like down - sizing ( a borrower who got in trouble owning the big house , sold it , and is buying the new affordable house but now has a dreadful credit history ) , amateur rehabbing ( intentionally buying substandard properties ) , or generally bizarre transactions ( non-arm ’s - length deals , buyouts of contracts for deed , seller carry - backs , blanket mortgages , what have you ) .
Plus the mobile homes .
In other words , not just marginal deals , but deals involving a tiny margin of the real estate market .
Until a few years ago , the idea that subprime lending could have real , measurable impact on the broad existing or new home sale market was , well , laughable .
The main impact of subprime lending on the overall mortgage business was the take - out function .
As subprime lending grew , you saw better “ performance ” of prime or near - prime mortgage portfolios .
This was not because subprime lending did away with the traditional default drivers of job loss , illness , divorce , or disorderly conduct ; it was because loans in that kind of trouble had a place to go besides foreclosure .
Prime lenders could and did congratulate themselves on their low foreclosure rates as if it were a matter of their superior underwriting skills , but that involves a high degree of naiveté .
It ’s really important to understand this issue , because it gets to the heart of the “ contagion ” thing .
It is not that subprime delinquencies are “ spreading ” to prime loans as if some infectious agent were in play .
It ’s that the drain got backed up : when subprime lenders go out of business , or investors wo n’t buy subprime loans , there is no place for the inevitable prime delinquencies to go except foreclosure .
Prime delinquencies become “ visible ” because they do n’t move out of the prime portfolio via refinance into the subprime portfolio , where we “ expect ” to see them .
This dynamic is obscured because subprime has recently become a significant part of the purchase - money business , and observers who come to it recently , lacking the historical view , take that as normal .
Because they do n’t understand the refinance or “ take out ” function of subprime , they fail to grasp its relationship to prime lending .
How , precisely , subprime became a purchase - money business is itself something that really needs explaining : in any informed view of the mortgage business , that ’s an unusual and troubling development .
You therefore have this giant conceptual gulf between industry analysts and the media , the latter being , on the whole , those who never really spotted the problem with the idea that homeownership is always and everywhere a good thing for everybody because it ’s always an “ investment . ”
If you believe that , you do n’t tend to see anything odd about lending practices that offer purchase - money ( not refi money ) to people who appear to have no particular qualifications for homeownership .
In essence , the old “ hard money ” or “ collateral dependent ” loan went mainstream , except that it went from the margins of the housing stock — manufactured homes , dilapidated row houses , the old farmstead — to the front and center — new homes , flashy condos , high - quality existing homes whose previous owners were heading for the McMansion .
Given assumptions about the collateral — like , its value always goes up and its value always goes up — you could more or less forget about problems with the other two Cs .
When the RE markets were hot enough , in fact , there were n’t “ problems ” with the other two Cs.
Sure , borrowers with loads of consumer debts and insufficient incomes failed to make mortgage payments just like they always did , but it was always possible to sell out from under foreclosure or get another cash - out .
A humming RE market keeps those cash - out appraisals plausible .
The RE market , in other words , functioned for subprime purchase - money loans the way subprime refinances always functioned for prime purchase - money loans : it “ took the loan out ” before anyone had to report defaults .
More than a few heady souls concluded that they had excellent underwriting expertise , since the subprime purchase - money loans they were making did n’t default much , just as their prime brethren assumed that it was their own underwriting , not the subprime refinancer ’s risk appetite , that kept their portfolios looking spotless .
But of course it got to the point where the RE market could n’t keep propping up subprime purchase loans without subprime purchase loans propping up the RE market .
That ’s why the two started to go south at the same time , and nobody can answer the question of which went first .
They went down together .
My own view is that overbuilding probably tipped the scale first : we just ran out of subprime borrowers before we ran out of houses .
Certainly , just before the end , we saw some real desperation in the subprime lenders ’ quest for purchase borrowers .
There have been more than a few media reports of subprime purchase loans given to undocumented immigrants ( complete with stated income and all that ) , which have led more than a few people ( judging from our comment threads ) to conclude that the entire subprime debacle was all about them illegals .
Of course it was n’t ; the subprime lenders just ran out of better choices and did n’t want to give up yet .
The association of subprime lending with the brown people is just the most overtly disgusting bit of bigotry to arise from the great mess .
The belief that subprime borrowers are “ poor people ” has taken root so deeply that you need a jackhammer to rip it out .
The capacity C of traditional underwriting was , of course , always relative to the proposed transaction .
A lower - income person buying a lower - priced property was , you see , not a case of subprime lending ; assuming a reasonable credit history , it was a prime loan .
People with quite good incomes and stellar credit histories who tried to buy way too much house got turned down by the prime lenders .
That was back in the days when you could live within your means , and you were expected to do so .
The trouble with the low - income prime loan was that it was a small prime loan .
And that there were , in many market areas , more lower - income people than lower - priced properties .
Both industry greed — wanting to make the biggest loans possible to make the biggest profits possible — and industry overcapacity , combined with ever less - affordable housing in the employment - rich population centers , brought us to a situation in which we might not have started with poor people , but they were certainly poor by the time we got done putting them into too much loan to buy too much house .
There are subprime borrowers you find .
There are those you create .
And of course low income does correlate with less education , leaving a lot of low income folks vulnerable to slimy mortgage originators .
And low income folks do tend to have a much harder time coming up with a sizable down payment , meaning that loans to low income folks are usually already tipping toward near - prime or subprime from the start , even before we look at other facts .
Until rather recently , though , you could have a lot of lower income applicants who could quite comfortably handle the payments ; they simply were n’t getting anywhere with accumulating the down payment , since renting was , in many parts of the country , actually more expensive than owning .
These folks were n’t going to get off the merry - go - round of handing over income to the landlord instead of saving it for a down payment unless someone came up with some non-traditional affordable housing loan programs , which we did .
There is a growing meme out there , particularly coming from the conservative think - tanks , that it was those affordable housing initiatives of the 90s that led us down the road to ruin .
Most of it is quite remarkable nonsense , as it skips over the part about how it managed to become more expensive ( in terms of monthly payment ) to own than to rent , how incomes stagnated , how young people started their careers with crippling educational debt , and how affordable housing initiatives ( not the loans but the actual development of inexpensive homes ) gave way to NIMBYism and investment in giant suburban cathedral - ceilinged heat - wasters and all that .
Of course it no longer made sense to use low down payment programs for first - time homebuyers if the monthly payment was no longer cheaper than , or at most slightly higher than , renting .
But it ’s rather hard for me to understand how rents were dropping relative to home prices and mortgage interest rates as a direct and uncomplicated effect of 5 % down programs that the GSEs offered in the 90s .
The argument goes that it was the relatively low defaults of those 90s - era affordable mortgage programs that spawned the current mess by giving everybody the impression that you could do no - down loans all over the place and not worry about it .
This assumes that the lending industry is so stupid that it cannot understand the mechanisms that kept those defaults low : first , selectivity in the programs ; second , the availability of home equity lenders ( the old subprimers ) to take out the problems ; third , cheaper real house prices .
Perhaps it is the case that the industry is too stupid , on the whole , to figure this out .
But how that becomes the “ fault of ” the original affordable housing initiatives just is n’t clear to me .
What is clear to me is how convenient this argument is for certain folks whose only other option is to admit to having been stupid and greedy .
Exhibit A , our favorite Tan Man , whose transformation from “ I got into this business to help poor brown people ” in the 90s to “ those brown people made me do it ” is nothing short of nauseating .
Exhibit B is everybody who decided that the best way to avoid being given fraudulent income and asset documentation and appraisals was to not ask for documentation or appraisals .
Exhibit C is everybody who made “ investment ” loans for properties that did not and could not cash - flow , and hence had to flip to survive .
Exhibit D is the “ bridge loan , ” or the product designed to blow up in 24 months and force either sale or refinance .
There are many more Exhibits in this sorry book .
The point is that the whole flimsy edifice had to fall down .
That it started with the weakest parts — subprime — is no surprise .
That this means that it ’s all about subprime is mystification .
So who are “ subprime ” borrowers ?
Right now , they are simply those borrowers whose bridges all burnt : ca n’t refinance , ca n’t sell , ca n’t cut the budget any further to stay in place .
A large chunk of them are currently in loan programs that were designated “ subprime . ”
Bunches more are in “ Alt - A ” and “ prime . ”
We do n’t have more subprime borrowers than we used to have ; we have fewer subprime lenders .
Perhaps it ’s clearer if we just talk about subprime customers , rather than “ borrowers , ” since you are n’t a borrower until someone makes a loan .
There are lots and lots of subprime customers right now .
There just are n’t very many subprime lenders left to fill the orders .
To be surprised that a lot of these subprime customers are right now hanging out ( by their fingernails ) in “ prime ” pools and portfolios is to be very naïve .
Another way to look at this is that what a credit crunch ( or contraction ) does is , precisely , move the goalposts : the universe of “ subprime ” borrowers can go from , say , 10 % of the customer pool to 20 % with the stroke of a pen on some underwriting guidelines .
An RE bust does the same thing : a few unfortunate comps , and somebody who was a nice middle class homeowner with equity last week is “ subprime ” this week .
As the dynamic feeds on itself , it begins to affect employment ( and hence medical insurance ) and , undoubtedly , the bliss of a lot of people ’s domestic arrangements .
I ’m pretty sure it causes at least a few bouts of disorderly conduct .
In that sense , the crunch / bust creates the “ normal ” or “ historical ” causes of mortgage delinquency , or at the least contributes to them mightily .
It therefore produces “ subprime . ”
It does not help to keep claiming it was produced by “ subprime ” defined as them .
My new motto — “ we are all subprime now ” — is an attempt to keep reminding the attention - impaired ( that would include but is n’t limited to reporters and politicians ) that demonizing “ subprime people ” is n’t going to prevent you from going there yourself .
The fact is that huge numbers of people who have “ prime ” mortgage loans could n’t refi or sell right now to — literally , for some of the uninsured — save their lives .
They may well still be making payments on the mortgage , but they ’re rapidly approaching upside - down if they ’re not there yet , they ’ve spent the proceeds of the previous cash - outs that kept up the lifestyle or just kept life together , and if the truth were known about credit card balances , their current FICOs probably are n’t the envy of the neighborhood either .
They are , in short , subprime .
They just do n’t recognize themselves in the stereotype of the deadbeat serial bankruptcy filer or the undocumented immigrant or the waitress in the McMansion or whatever extreme case you can dredge up and label “ typical ” for subprime .
They are , increasingly , “ us . ”
The invisible subprimers will do okay if this blows over and they do n’t lose their jobs : if and when the RE market recovers , anyone who hung onto the mortgage he has will come out “ prime ” again .
That ’s the good news .
The bad news is that attributing this solely to your own prudence and good judgment and inherent worth as “ not one of those subprime people ” is a form of delusion .
Subprime is like the weather : when it rains , everybody gets wet .
The political pressure for “ bailout ” measures has a little bit , in my view , to do with bleeding - heart sympathy for the poor and a lot , a whole lot , to do with the dawning recognition of too many middle - class homeowners that , well , we are all subprime now , but nobody ’s filling our orders .
I for one fail to understand how the American economy can get by without subprime lenders .
Sending everyone with a problem directly to bankruptcy just wo n't work : that 's a recipe for a permanent credit crunch .
Where I part company with those who fret that over - regulation of the subprime industry will " hurt the poor " is precisely on the matter of the subprime purchase money market .
If people cannot afford to own homes , then encouraging them to buy them anyway with impossible loan terms is not solving that problem .
And contracting the refinance function of the subprime industry instead of its purchase function simply produces the kind of situation we have now , where you can be taken in but you can't be taken out .
What I think we should be most worried about is that reaction to the " Home ATM " problem -- overconsumption financed by a home equity bubble -- will create a long - term backlash against distressed loan take - out financing , because it 's cash - out as much as because it's " subprime . "
Certainly a large number of the over - consumers will have to end up in BK and / or foreclosure ; too many people just wo n't live long enough lifetimes to earn the income they 've already spent .
But subprime refinancing can have a real utility for the rest of us in the job loss / illness / divorce / bender category , especially when a large RE price correction makes us all upside down .
But then I am generally convinced that the only way out of a credit crunch is selective loosening .
" Selective " here meaning that one selects the market segment in which risk - taking has the biggest payoff , economically , and then one takes the risk there .
So instead of working ourselves up over making sure that cheap prime credit jumbo purchase loans are available , we should be worrying about whether we are making enough mid-market subprime refinances , not too few .
This will continue to sound like some odd variation on homeopathy until we stop thinking about " subprime " as the cause , not the effect , of a much larger problem .
In a move applauded by anti-immigrant groups and criticized by business groups , President Bush signed an executive order requiring companies that deal with the federal government to use an electronic system to verify their workers are in the country legally .
The Department of Homeland Security must draw up the regulations for implementing the plan , and it is unclear how many firms would be forced to comply .
However , an agency official said it could involve millions of workers .

uWink : A Cold Greasy Plate of Fail
JoAnne and I had dinner at uWink last night .
uWink is Nolan Bushnell 's new high - tech restaurant concept , where every diner has their own touch screen for ordering food and playing games .
The concept may not be so bad , if your goals include minimizing ( almost removing ) interaction with waitstaff and adding opportunities to interact with other diners , but wow right now this is a terrible realization of that concept .
From the perspective of a customer it was ridiculously terrible .
As a software guy , I found it totally entertaining and educational — failure on this scale is compelling .
When we first walked in , JoAnne asked the host about some tables that looked like they were set up as multi-player LCD projector - based gaming stations .
The host said “ Oh , those do n't work .
I do n't really know why not . ”
That could be the restaurant 's motto .
Once we were seated , I swiped my driver 's license and our waiter / runner helped us login .
I entered my name and then JoAnne accidentally skipped past the part where she was supposed to enter her name .
There was no going back , so she was “ Guest 2 ” from then on .
We ordered food and drinks , and the interface was pretty straightforward , but tedious and slow compared to the old fashioned way of ordering .
After submitting our order we got a screen for paying our bill .
So we paid it , before we even got our drinks .
Then our screen locked up .
We flagged someone down and were told that once you pay your bill your session ends , so we should have waited until the end of the meal .
This also meant that we lost the game credits from our previous order .
The runner reset the thing and we logged in again .
This time JoAnne entered her name but I got confused and skipped past my part and so I became Guest 2 .
I think we both need to sign up for classes at the Learning Center .
About every two minutes a big message would pop up asking if we wanted to join a group game .
This was extra distracting when we were busy trying to figure out how to remove something from our order or submit a request for more bbq sauce for my sandwich .
We played a bunch of games , which were mostly kind of pointless or difficult to figure out .
There was a Boggle clone that was fun because we played against two other tables ( we smoked 'em ) .
There were constant crashes , hangs , resets , error messages and console spew .
For a while one of the projectors displaying group game info just showed a big 404 error .
Two or three times we had to ask a waiter to go in back and reset our station .
If you need a waiter for something , like more salt or bbq sauce , you need to touch the help icon , then select “ I need assistance $ 0.00 ” or “ I need more sugars $ 0.00 ” or “ I just want someone to explain to me why it costs $ 0.95 to get my drink up as opposed to on the rocks $ 0.00 ” and add it to your order , then submit the order .
For real .
Only a programmer could come up with an interface like that and then not be ashamed to unleash it on the public .
You 're a finger .
The guy with two kids who sat down at the table behind us gave up and left after 15 minutes .
If we did n't find the whole thing so funny we might have done the same .
At a conference last year I heard Bushnell talk about how he wanted robot waiters that could serve your food at uWink .
At the time I thought that would be fun and awesome , but I 'm having second thoughts today .
It 's true that the restaurant has only been open for a year , but it 's in need of something more profound than a few software tweaks .
Summary : Ambitious idea , less than impressive UI design , terrible execution .
Food was eh .
Once they get robots , stay away — for your own safety .

But as pervasive as it is now , marketers are working hard behind the scenes to make sure it 's much , much worse in the future .
Doing things like ...
You 'll be exposed to around 6,000 marketing messages today , according to researchers .
You 're looking at a few right now .
Glance away from your computer and you 'll see another one - - a label on a bottle , a logo on a t - shirt , a billboard outside the window .
5 Tracking Every Site You Browse and Every Show You Watch

Market research used to be pretty simple .
You 'd just put the new hamburger in front of a group of people and had them fill out a survey asking if they liked it , did n't like it and what degree of diarrhea it gave them .
The problem of course was nobody told the truth on those things .
For instance , they 'll fill out surveys saying they want healthier food on the menu , then will continue to buy the Baconator .
So how 's a poor market researcher supposed to get a straight answer out of you ?
Easy : Just collect the data of your personal habits without you ever knowing .
It 's kind of like the dude who sneaks around outside your wife 's window at night , only they 're peering in through your computer or TV screen instead , and hopefully there 's less masturbating .

What They 're Doing :
So for instance , your TiVo grants you the miracle of watch - on - demand television and skippable ads , but also tracks what you watch , right down to which scenes you rewound and replayed over and over .
But of course the web is light years ahead of TV in tracking your surfing habits .
Google is already working on customizing its search results based on your personal browsing history , which requires only that it maintains a comprehensive database of every single thing you 've ever tried to find on the web .
No big deal , right ?
After all , it 's not like it would be embarrassing for you if all this information ever got out .
You know , like when AOL made that information public on millions of its customers .

Speaking of AOL , they own a company called Tacoda which specializes in " behavioral targeting . "
Tacoda 's technology is used on around 4,000 websites ( which reach around 70 percent of the total internet audience ) .
Every letter typed , every click or move of the mouse on the websites they 're associated with is tracked , and they 're hardly the only player in this game .
Oh , and how about BuzzMetrics ?
blogs , Facebook pages , message boards , chatrooms , Usenet groups -- anywhere the internet denizens can post their leet - speak - filled opinions -- are being monitored .
The conversation is then fed into programs that calculate the current buzz or trends .
Yes , believe it or not , that 20 - page debate between two 13 - year - olds about whether Batman could beat up Iron Man will help dictate what next year 's marketing campaign will look like .

If You Think It 's Bad Now ...
Pretty soon , that technique for tracking your habits will become just as common in the real world .
Those awesome GPS boxes for your car that prompt you with turn - by - turn directions ?
They also keep track of where you 're going ( maybe you heard the government wants to use the data to tax you , according to your driving habits ) .
They 're developing refrigerators with the super - handy feature that it tracks what you have inside , reminds you when you 're out , and lets you order more without leaving the house .
Oh , also , it lets retailers track every single thing you buy , all via RFID chips embedded in the product packaging .

Hell , they 're even coming out with a wide range of " smart clothes " with computer functions built in that can track all of your bodily functions .
Soon vital data on testicular bunching , shifting and chafing can constantly be beamed straight from your boxers to a team of guys looking at a diagram of your nuts .

Iraq is preparing to allow four of the biggest western oil companies to renew exploitation of the country 's vast reserves for the first time in almost four decades .
Iraq 's oil ministry stepped up talks with BP , Exxon Mobil , Shell and Total after the US vice - president , Dick Cheney , visited Iraq in March , where he also pressed the government to revive efforts to pass the hydrocarbon law that nationalist MPs were blocking .
The first contracts are expected to be signed this month .
Some 90 % of Iraq 's budget comes from oil revenues .
Iraq 's oil minister , Hussain al - Shahristani , told the Guardian this week that the deals did not amount to the privatisation of the country 's oil .
But the four companies are heirs to the consortium given the concession to control Iraq 's oil by King Faisal , the foreign Sunni Arab whom the British imposed on Iraq 's majority Shia population after occupying the country during the first world war .
They lost their right to explore new fields in 1961 after the monarchy was overthrown , and nationalisation followed under the Ba'ath party .
There was no competitive bidding for the concessions , which are to be awarded to the four giants plus Chevron and some smaller companies .
After the US - led invasion in 2003 the companies supplied advisers and trainers to the oil ministry for free in the hope of getting a foot in the door .
The Russian company Lukoil did the same but lost the contract for Iraq 's largest undeveloped field to Total and Chevron .
Chinese and Indian firms also lost out .
Laws on how to develop Iraq 's oil and share the profits between its regions stalled in parliament last autumn .
To calm nationalist fears , the contracts are limited to " technical support " for two years .
The companies will sell expertise and equipment rather than providing capital and management control .
The aim is to increase production by 100,000 barrels a day in each of the four fields .
But the deals , known as service contracts , are unusual , said Greg Mutitt , co-director of Platform , an oil industry research group .
" Normally such service contracts are carried out by specialist companies ...
The majors are not normally interested in such deals , preferring to invest in projects that give them a stake in ownership of extracted oil and the potential for large profits .
The explanation is that they see them as a stepping stone ... "
He said the companies ' lawyers had been insisting " on extension rights under which each company would get first preference on any future contract for the field on which it has worked " .
You ’ve been using your computer for years , and up until today , you never had to open it .
You do n’t know much about computers anyways , so if everything seems to be working fine , why would you bother ?
But this morning , after unsuccessfully trying to power it on , you decide to drag your computer from its comfy looking spot under your desk .
You unscrew the side panel , and a vision of horror jumps at you .
Little did you know that furry little creatures called dust bunnies like to get into your systems at night .
They usually are very insidious , so you often wo n’t notice them until it ’s too late .
The moral of this story ?
Everyone should open their computer case from time to time .
A little bit of compressed air in there each 2 - 3 months can’t really hurt now , can it ?

The need to negotiate means one nation has problems to iron out with another .
And those the US has the biggest problems with are much less likely to be friends than they are states that sponsor terrorism or are run by tyrants .
Obviously then , the most critical negotiation is that between states at odds with each other .
Though this author has only been a student of foreign policy for five years he ’d never come across the Bush administration ’s notion that you do n’t negotiate with countries like North Korea , Iran , or Syria .
Besides that it suspiciously resembles a snit , where , we wondered , is the historical precedent ?
Sparing us hours of research , that paragon of good sense , Fred Kaplan at Slate , mercifully provided it for us .
It turns out , that with presidents , anyway , a precedent , to a certain extent , exists .
In “ Is Barack Obama Too NaÃ¯ve To Be President ? ” Kaplan address Obama ’s willingness to speak with leaders of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba and North Korea without preconditions .
The remark did violate an article in the playbook of Cold War diplomacy : that a presidential visit is special , something that the recipient of the visit .
. . needs to earn ; that .
. . before such a hallowed event can be scheduled , the grunts need to complete all the “ spade work , ” leaving little for the presidents to do beyond signing on the dotted line .
Trouble is the Bush administration has been averse to even allowing the grunts to dig the diplomatic ditches .
Until , that is , it relented with Christopher Hill in North Korea — perhaps the only act of foreign policy on the part of the Bush administration even resembling success — and with Condoleezza Rice in the Middle East ( not much to report on that front ) .
Meanwhile Kaplan continues on the subject of presidential diplomacy :
But . . . and Obama seems to have a grip on this .
. .
A presidential visit is not the cherished commodity that it once was , because the United States is no longer the superpower that it used to be .
Look at the deals that foreign leaders are cutting on their own .
Israel and Hamas are talking about a cease - fire , using Egypt as a mediator .
Turkey is serving as middleman in talks between Israel and Syria .
The political factions in Lebanon worked out an accord , under Qatar ’s supervision .
. . . the more these kinds of deals get struck without American involvement , the more marginalized we become .
In other words , because the rest of the world no longer quakes in fear of America , we can no longer remain aloof .
Not only must its diplomats jump down in the ditches , our next president needs to show up at the job site and make sure the customer is satisfied .
Most people who have had significant contact with the US medical establishment have had an ultrasound .
The machines are cheap and easy to use , and provide a rough picture of the state of our internal organs without an invasive procedure or exposure to ionizing radiation .
These two safety factors probably contribute heavily to its use for pre-natal checkups that ascertain the health of the developing fetus , the results of which many of you have also seen .
But a just - released study suggests that ultrasound may have some subtle effects on embryonic brain development .
The study looked at the developing cortex of the brain .
This portion of the brain develops through a stereotypical pattern .
The precursors of neurons exist in a single layer of proliferating cells at the base of the cortex .
These cells mature into neurons in waves , each of which migrates to the top of the structure .
Thus , as more waves are produced over time , the cortex begins to resemble a layer cake , with each layer performing a specialized function .
One consequence of this process is that the later waves of cells have to migrate ever further before settling down .
The researchers gave pregnant mice injections with a chemical that marked dividing cells , allowing them to track a single wave of differentiating neurons .
One half of the mice were given ultrasound , while controls were put through the same procedure without the ultrasound device being activated .
In all cases , the migration of neurons in the embryonic cortex was examined after birth .
In both control and exposed samples , a small number of neurons either never made the migration , or got lost along the way , taking up residence in the wrong layer .
The difference was in the numbers ; once the ultrasound exposure went on for a half - hour or more , the number of neurons getting lost was consistently larger in the exposed group .
It 's important to note that these results , although statistically significant , were variable , and the sample size was relatively small .
The net result was also simply an enhancement of a situation that 's apparently perfectly normal .
The authors also discuss the significant differences between the mouse and human brains , not the least of which is that the human cortex develops over a time period that 's three times longer than the entire mouse pregnancy .
At the same time , the distance human neurons travel is over an order of magnitude further , and the complex brains of primates may have a lower tolerance for error .
In short , these results are suggestive ; a cause for further study , but not a cause for alarm .
The discussion of the paper wraps up by noting that the FDA already recommends against unnecessary ultrasounds , and calls for similar studies to be performed in non-human primates .
It 's hard to argue with that conclusion .
