Macho , macho man .
I ’ve got to be , a macho man .
Macho , macho man .
I ’ve got to be a macho ! —
The Village People
It 's more than 30 years since that Disco Era anthem first blared though dance club speakers and into America 's consciousness , but does the message still sing true for the 2lst century male ?
Does he still got to be a macho man ?
Are there penalties for not being macho enough ?
Corinne A. Moss - Racusin , a doctoral candidate in Rutgers ' Department of Psychology , explored the consequences for men ( and women ) when they acted modestly in job interviews .
She co-authored , with graduate fellow Julie E. Phelan and Professor Laurie A. Rudman , " When Men Break the Gender Rules : Status Incongruity and Backlash Against Modest Men " in the journal Psychology of Men and Masculinity .
According to Moss - Racusin , the applicants in the staged interviews were judged equally competent , but the " modest " males were less liked , a sign of social backlash .
Modesty was viewed as a sign of weakness , a low - status character trait for males that could adversely affect their employability or earnings potential .
Modesty in women , however , was not viewed negatively nor was it linked to status .
" For men and women , there are things they must and must not be , " Moss - Racusin says .
" Women must be communal and other - oriented , but they must not be dominant .
Historically and cross-culturally , men have been stereotyped as more agentic , that is , more independent and self - focused than women . "
In the study , 132 female and 100 male student volunteers ( who earned partial academic credit for their psychology course ) viewed videotaped , 15 - minute job interviews of either males or females .
All the applicants were paid actors rehearsed to deliver similar , " modest " responses for the gender - neutral position that required strong technical abilities and social skills .
The researchers sought to determine which gender stereotype promote backlash .
" Women are allowed to be weak while this trait is strongly prohibited in men , " Moss - Racusin said .
" By contrast , dominance is reserved for men and prohibited for women .
Thus , gender stereotypes are comprised of four sets of rules and expectations for behavior consist of both ' shoulds ' and ' should nots ' for each gender . "
The researchers ' prediction that modest male applicants would face hiring discrimination was not supported , however , and she speculates that because men's status is higher than women's , meek men are afforded the benefit of the doubt and are less likely to encounter hiring discrimination than dominant women .

AT lunchtime on a recent steamy day , I got the unlikely idea to cross a smoothie with gazpacho .
Given my languid state , I had wanted something icy and filling , but not too taxing to prepare .
My first inclination was to make my go - to summer meal in a glass , a yogurt fruit smoothie .
The yogurt provides the protein to make it feel substantial , while the fruit makes it sweet , and plenty of ice keeps it cold .
But I wanted something savory and salty — and just as unfussy .
I immediately thought of gazpacho .
It has a lot going for it , summer - lunch - wise .
It ’s cold .
It ’s easy ( put vegetables and seasonings in blender , blend , eat ) .
But it ’s not filling .
Given the absence of protein , I ’d probably end up rooting around in the refrigerator an hour after eating it , looking for lunch No. 2 .

Struggling NBC is clearly the network that needs the biggest fall overhaul .
But CBS , it turns out , is the network going into the 2010 - 11 season with the most radically altered lineup .
In a surprising move , CBS announced yesterday that it will move the hit sitcom “ The Big Bang Theory ’’ from Mondays to Thursdays at 8 p.m .
Going up against NBC ’s critically praised but modestly rated “ Community ’ ’ and “ 30 Rock , ’’ “ Big Bang ’ ’ will be followed by “ Bleep My Dad Says ’’ starring William Shatner at 8:30 p.m.
“ Bleep ’ ’ is based on writer Justin Halpern ’s Twitter feed about his father ’s more colorful comments .
Also surprising from CBS : “ CSI : Miami ’’ will move to Sundays , “ CSI : NY ’’ will move to Fridays , and “ Survivor ’ ’ will move to Wednesdays .
Meanwhile , “ The New Adventures of Old Christine , ’’ “ Ghost Whisperer , ’’ and “ Gary Unmarried ’ ’ wo n’t be moving anywhere .
They ’ve been canceled .
The same for “ Miami Medical , ’’ “ Numb3rs , ’’ “ Accidentally on Purpose ’ ’ and “ Cold Case . ’’
CBS ’s list of new shows includes a “ Hawaii 5 - 0 ’’ remake with Daniel Dae Kim from “ Lost ’ ’ and Alex O’Loughlin , as well as “ Blue Bloods ’ ’ with Tom Selleck .
“ Blue Bloods ’ ’ also features two Massachusetts natives , Donnie Wahlberg and Bridget Moynahan , which must be why the family cop drama is set in New York .
CBS ’s promised “ Criminal Minds ’ ’ spinoff featuring Forest Whitaker has been scheduled for midseason .
Next to CBS ’s aggressive changes , ABC looks like more of a Sleepy Sally .
It has canceled “ FlashForward , ’’ “ Better Off Ted , ’’ “ Romantically Challenged , ’’ and “ Scrubs . ’’
Its list of new shows includes “ No Ordinary Family , ’’ with Michael Chiklis as part of a family with superpowers , and “ Detroit 1 - 8 - 7 , ’’ with Michael Imperioli from “ The Sopranos ’ ’ as a homicide detective .
The comedy “ Mr. Sunshine , ’’ starring Matthew Perry as a guy in a midlife crisis , is due midseason .
Also due midseason : “ Off the Map , ’’ yet another ensemble medical drama from Shonda Rhimes of “ Grey ’s Anatomy ’ ’ and “ Private Practice . ’’

In the five minutes it takes you to read this article , 10 children will die in Africa from malaria .
It 's a horrifying thought , but you and your computer can do something to help .
Take part in research and help defeat malaria by donating your spare computing power to Africa@home — a distributed computing project that runs mathematical simulations of how malaria is spread .
This research will help to find the best way to deliver vaccines and interventions such as mosquito nets to control the transmission of the disease and save lives .
Malaria is responsible for a million deaths every year in sub-Saharan Africa , and is the single biggest killer in children there under five .
It is a parasitic infection that passes to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito .
The parasite has a complex life cycle , undergoing several changes once inside a human host until it can be passed back to mosquitoes biting the infected person .
Victims of malaria get flu - like symptoms ( vomiting , headaches , fever ) but it can become fatal , attacking the red blood cells , and by blocking the capillaries that take blood to the brain and other organs .
There are some treatments for malaria , mostly taken to prevent infection , such as chloroquine tablets which you might have taken before a holiday to countries in Africa or Asia .
Other preventative measures , such as mosquito nets treated with insecticide , can have an impact on the spread of the disease .
And despite the difficulty of attacking an infection that goes through as many forms as malaria , vaccines are finally being developed and tested in clinical trials .
But clinical trials can only uncover the short - term effects of a treatment .
The vaccine may not be as good as it seems , it may simply delay death for example , or it may have positive benefits like improving the immunity of the community in some cumulative way , but these effects would not become apparent for a long time .
If the clinical trials miss these effects , the resulting assessment of the vaccine may be more positive , or negative , than its real impact warrants .
The complex lifecycle of malaria — image from malariahotspots.co.uk
MalariaControl.net is a mathematical model developed by researchers at the Swiss Tropical Institute that simulates the spread of malaria .
It is a set of related submodels simulating different components of the transmission and impact of the disease .
The equations involved describe how the infection is passed to humans , simulate the infection within the host , how it is passed back to mosquitoes and the likelihood of sickness and death .
Parameters include the average body surface area of a person by age ( the larger your body surface area , the more mosquito bites you can expect which will affect your chances of catching malaria ) , seasonal transmission rates ( rain gives mosquitoes more places to breed , and the development of the mosquito larvae and malaria parasite is regulated by temperature ) , and the levels of infection within the host in all it 's different life stages .
These mathematical models are stochastic — they move through time , step by step , generating probabilities for the possible outcomes at each stage .
Because the model simulates many of the components of the transmission of the disease in an integrated way , it offers the opportunity to simulate the complex effects interventions such as vaccines could have on the spread of malaria .
It can incorporate measures like providing mosquito nets or vaccination programmes and simulate the impact of these interventions over long periods of time .
This more complex model of these interactions is more realistic than previous attempts , but requires vast computer resources to run .
And that is where you come in .
Like SETI@home and GIMPS ( read more about these on Plus ) , idle processing power of computers like yours or mine can provide the computer power needed by Africa@home , a research project based at CERN .
You can download MalariaControl.net to your computer , and while you are making that cup of tea or watching the world go by your window , your computer can be playing its part in perfecting the mathematical model of malaria transmission in Africa .
Using the donated computer power the simulations will be run many times with slightly varying starting points .
This technique , called ensemble forecasting , provides more realistic predictions from models of very complex systems , and has previously been used in weather prediction and climate change modelling .
The researchers explain , in the August issue of The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene , that if predictions from MalariaControl.net remain " substantially unchanged across a range of different sets of assumptions " we can be more confident that they are a realistic picture of the future .
Ronald Ross
There is a long history of using mathematical models to assist in decisions about the control of infectious diseases .
Malaria was one of the first diseases to be tackled this way , with the English mathematician and doctor Ronald Ross developing the first mathematical model for malaria nearly a century ago .
The team behind MalariaControl .
net believe it is the " most comprehensive population - based simulation of malaria yet developed " , and integrates both the epidemiological and economic considerations affecting strategies to control the disease .
It is expected that most of the volunteers of computer time will be based in the developed world , but an important part of the project is the involvement of African scientists in this research .
A group of researchers from Mali , Bamako and Cameroon are part of the project team at CERN , and future Africa@home projects plan to enable researchers in Africa to setup and run their own distributed computing projects .
Africa@home is offering many people the chance to be a part of groundbreaking research that can save lives in Africa .
Why do n't you become one of them ?

Considering the current state of the effort it ’s hard not to take a serious look at the Russian solution .
There ’s always a bit of ego and history involved in the US - Russian relationship but scientists are scientists and if they say they want to help , they probably really want to help .
BBC :
Standing on a barge that transports the two subs after their submersion , the Mir - 2 captain underlined that the subs were probably the only deep - sea vessels in the world capable of stopping the leak .
“ Our subs are unique .
There are two of them and they can submerge and work simultaneously .
Also , they are powerful enough to work with any other additional equipment .
“ There are only four vessels in the world that can go down to 6,000 m – the Mirs , French Nautile and Japanese Shinkai .
The Mirs are known to be the best , and we have a very experienced team of specialists , ” he said .
But Mr Chernyaev added that such an operation would have a chance of succeeding only if BP or the US government asked the Russian government to join efforts to stop the leak .
Christopher J. Ferguson , associate professor at Texas A&M International University has completed a study on the effects of playing violent video games on 103 frustrated young adults .
The results suggest that violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management .
This should come as no surprise to anyone who plays the odd video game .
They ’re games .
But , some people who play the odd video game know people who do n’t .
Perhaps they ’d like something to link those people to ?
In Ferguson ’s study , about one hundred young people were given a “ frustration task ” and then either played no game , a non-violent game , a violent game where you were the good guy , or a violent game where you were a bad guy ( chosen randomly ) .
It does seem that playing violent games may help reduce stress and make people less depressed and hostile . ”
Ferguson cautioned that these results were correlational [ sic ] , however , and more research is needed .
However , he suggested that video games could increasingly be used in therapy with young adults and teens .
Violent games may help people work through their frustrations with real life and calm down without increasing aggressive behaviors in real life .
Again , this probably does n’t surprise anyone who regularly plays mainstream video games .
It would n’t be a recreational activity if it did n’t reduce our stress .
But there are plenty of people out there using only slightly less rigorous methods to say that games are bad for you .
It ’s nice to have some contrast .

There were no crowds ten thousand strong on College St. last Saturday , no undercover cops , no riot police with truncheons , and no shards of broken glass .
A protest , all the same .
Last Saturday , at noon , Norman Perrin brought his civilian citation for an act of bravery to police headquarters and turned it in .
After the events of the G20 , he did n’t want it any more .
Let ’s back up :
Twenty years ago , Norman and a friend went out for a birthday drink ; on the way home , they heard , they saw , and they stopped a sexual assault .
Norman said , “ A woman was being assaulted there by a man she ’d turned down at a bar .
My friend went to investigate .
The man was beating her head against the cement .
I went to call the police .
My friend threw me his keys , and said I should get some pants and a shirt for her . ”
Pants and a shirt ; use your imagination .
The cops came in a hurry ; and , as a result of the testimony of Norman and his friend , the bad guy went to jail for a good long stretch .
There you have it : an act of bravery , an intervention , the response of two citizens to an assault .
Norman said , “ There was a rubber chicken dinner .
The police band played rock favourites , the kind they play in high schools to appeal to the kids . ”
We were sitting in front of police headquarters ; as he told the story , he dug into his bag for the plaque .
“ In grateful acknowledgement of outstanding services and unselfish assistance rendered to the Metropolitan Police in the preservation of peace and order . ”
Peace and order ?
Hold that thought , and know this about Norman : his father was in the military , and he was in the reserves when he was in his teens .
The last time — the only other time — he had anything to do with the police was a couple of years ago , when he got a ticket for riding his bike through a stop sign .
He carries no ID .
The cop was rude and crude .
Now jump forward to the G20 ruckus :
Norman avoided downtown that weekend but he , like everyone else , knew what was going on .
“ The air was full of people talking about what had happened to their friends . ”
A thousand arrests , people being stopped for no good reason , ID demanded , and so on .
Norman frowned .

“ The main thing was that 5 - metre rule , but they were arresting people two miles away .
And then we heard the premier saying that no new powers were given to the police .
If that ’s the case , what protection do I have now ?
And what the hell can I do about that ? ”
The question was not rhetorical .
“ I can give this back . ”
And so , when the weekend ’s dust had settled , Norman called the cop shop and asked how he might proceed .
No one on duty could tell him a thing , so he decided to hand it over in person on Saturday at noon .
I followed him as he entered police headquarters .
He explained himself to the officer at reception .
She , taken aback , called for a superior officer .
For the most part , Staff Sgt. Clarke listened politely , but the discussion was not at all satisfactory .
Sgt. Clarke said , “ I ’m not in a position to accept this . ”
He told Norman to give it to the Police Services Board .
Norman said no , he ’d come to leave it , and so he did .
Clarke asked if he wanted a receipt .
Norman did n’t .
Clarke asked for Norman ’s name .
Norman rolled his eyes and said it was on the citation .
Outside , lighter of step if not exactly pleased , he said , “ Done best , done quickly , I guess . ”
Like all acts of courage .
Joe Fiorito appears Monday , Wednesday and Friday .

JOHANNESBURG 
New mining in Zimbabwe has quickly yielded millions of carats of diamonds and could help catapult the nation into the ranks of the world ’s top diamond producers , according to the head of a group of experts for the United Nations - backed effort to stop the trade in conflict diamonds .
But the new wealth has provoked fears that the riches will be used to subvert attempts to bring democracy to a country that has long suffered under authoritarian rule , and also to finance conflicts .
“ This is a world - class deposit , no doubt about it , ” said the expert , Mark Van Bockstael .
He described the concentrations of diamonds in the Marange fields in eastern Zimbabwe as among the highest in the world : “ The deposit is a freak of nature . ”
Other experts agree it is an important find , while awaiting more data to gauge its full magnitude .
But the steady accumulation of stones has already emboldened President Robert Mugabe , 86 , to consolidate control over the Marange fields to prolong his 30 - year grip on power , members of his inner circle said .
Massive space storms forecast as sun awakens from ‘ deep slumber ’
Scientists have warned that massive space storms could be on the way as the Sun wakes from a ‘ deep slumber ’ .
The Sun follows an 11 - year cycle of high and low periods of solar activity .
It is now leaving a notably quiet phase and scientists expect to see a sharp increase in the number of solar flares as well as unprecedented levels of magnetic energy .
This could have catastrophic consequences for Earth .
Solar flares which have the power of 100 hydrogen bombs , could cause twenty times more damage than Hurricane Katrina
The rings of fire , which have the power of 100 hydrogen bombs , could cause twenty times more economic damage than Hurricane Katrina .
Experts met in Washington DC last week to discuss how to protect Earth from the ferocious flares , which are expected sometime around 2013 .
The ' space conference ' was attended by scientists , government policy - makers and researchers .
Richard Fisher , head of Nasa 's Heliophysics Division , explained : ' The Sun is waking up from a deep slumber , and in the next few years we expect to see much higher levels of solar activity .
‘ At the same time , our technological society has developed an unprecedented sensitivity to solar storms . ’
Nasa is using dozens of satellites – including the Solar Dynamics Observatory – to study the threat .
This graphic shows how the sun 's solar flares could endanger human life by interfering with high - tech systems such as satellites and power grids
The problem was investigated in depth two years ago by the National Academy of Sciences , in a report which outlined the social and economic impacts of severe space weather events .
It noted how people of the 21st - century rely on high - tech systems for the basics of daily life .
Smart power grids , GPS navigation , air travel , financial services and emergency radio communications can all be knocked out by intense solar activity .
But much of the damage could be minimised if there was foreknowledge that the storm was approaching .
Putting satellites in ' safe mode ' and disconnecting transformers could protect them from damaging electrical surges .
Preventative action , however , requires accurate forecasting - a job that has been assigned to The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA . )
' Space weather forecasting is still in its infancy , but we 're making rapid progress , ' says Thomas Bogdan , director of NOAA 's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder , Colorado .
Bogdan sees the collaboration between Nasa and NOAA as key .
' NASA 's fleet of heliophysics research spacecraft provides us with up - to - the - minute information about what 's happening on the Sun .
They are an important complement to our own GOES and POES satellites , which focus more on the near - Earth environment . '
VENTURA , Calif . -
A man who sued a California police department after he was shocked twice with a Taser has been awarded $ 1 in damages .
A federal court jury in Ventura County awarded Max Vasquez the minimum figure earlier this month in his excessive - force lawsuit .
Vasquez claimed a Santa Paula officer jolted him twice - including once while he was partially handcuffed - during his arrest three years ago on suspicion of domestic violence and resisting an officer .
The charges were later dropped .
Last year , Santa Paula agreed to pay $ 250,000 in a lawsuit by a man who claimed he suffered a serious back injury when he was taken to the ground and shocked twice in 2006 .
[ JURIST ]
The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit [ official website ] ruled [ opinion , PDF ]
Tuesday that the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) [ official website ] indecency policy [ text ] is unconstitutional .
The court held that the FCC ’s policy is a violation of the First Amendment [ text ] right to freedom of speech because it is unconstitutionally vague and could have a “ chilling effect ” on speech .
The case was originally filed by Fox Television Stations [ corporate website ] after the FCC changed its longstanding policy to allow broadcast corporations to be fined based on isolated expletives .
Fox argued that the agency ’s indecency test was unconstitutionally vague because it provided no clear guidelines as to what is covered by the agency ’s policy , forcing broadcast corporations to severely limit speech in order to avoid potential fines .
The court agreed with Fox , finding that :
Under the current policy , broadcasters must choose between not airing or censoring controversial programs and risking massive fines or possibly even loss of their licenses , and it is not surprising which option they choose .
Indeed , there is ample evidence in the record that the FCC ’s indecency policy has chilled protected speech .
FCC Commissioner Michael Copps [ official profile ] called Tuesday ’s ruling “ anti- family ” [ press release , PDF ] , stating that the court was more concerned with the “ chilling effect ” the indecency policy has on “ indecent programming ” rather than the ability of parents to protect their children .
Copps urged the government to appeal the decision and called on the FCC to “ clarify and strengthen its indecency framework to ensure that American parents can protect their children from the indecent and violent images that bombard us more and more each day . ”
The US Supreme Court [ official website ; JURIST news archive ] remanded the case to the appeals court after ruling [ opinion text ; JURIST report ] in April 2009 that the FCC did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in changing its policy regarding fines for the broadcast of isolated expletives .
That ruling overturned a previous decision [ JURIST report ] by the Second Circuit , which held that the 2004 policy was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act [ text ] for failing to articulate a reasoned basis for its change in policy .
The Supreme Court declined to address the constitutionality of the FCC policy in its decision and remanded the case to the lower court for further consideration of the constitutional issue .
Because we do n't have enough concrete in our lives .
It used to be that Cleveland ’s highways provided glorious views of our sacred landscape .
But the Ohio Department of Transportation ’s efforts to contain noise has rendered the experience more akin to a scenic jaunt through Soviet - era Berlin .
A “ noise mitigation ” project under way in Old Brooklyn has neighbors up in arms about uglification of the landscape and elimination of trees .
They point to the crumbling decay of barrier walls near Hopkins Airport and the seeping white stains on walls that have been dyed red in order to look more like red concrete .
ODOT spokeswoman Jocelynn Clemings admits that there ’s no maintenance budget for the walls , which appear to crumble with the ease of a Ritz cracker .
She adds that they ’re hoping to come up with some money — that ’s where you come in — to repair the broken ones .
Folks in the neighborhood also point to the elimination of dozens of trees ( otherwise known as Nature ’s Sound Barriers ™ ) being cut down along the highway between Denison Avenue and West 25th Street to make way for more concrete .
“ My main concern is seeing these decades - old trees brought down , ” says Christopher Pekoc , an artist who has residences in Old Brooklyn and Tremont — neighborhoods on both ends of the wall .
“ There are alternatives , but ODOT does n’t seem to be aware of those .
My hope is that we can stop damaging and removing decades ’ worth of tree growth and bring ODOT into the green 21st century . ”
Clemings says alternatives such as “ living walls ” — similar to trees — have not been tested in Ohio .
“ It sucks that ODOT has no green , sustainable alternative other than cement or aluminum walls , ” says councilman Brian Cummins .
“ They have nothing tested , nothing in their repertoire . ”
Nothing green , but they do offer a stunning red .

The FDA continues to allow use of a dangerous livestock drug banned in 160 countries , including across Europe , China and Taiwan , even though the agency itself admits that the chemical is highly toxic to humans .
The drug in question is known as ractopamine , and it increases the body 's synthesis of protein -- thereby causing animals to bulk up and yield more meat .
Ractopamine is in the family of drugs known as beta - agonists , which contains many asthma drugs .
Yet ractopamine is so dangerous to human health that the FDA requires it to be labeled , " Not for use in humans .
Individuals with cardiovascular disease should exercise special caution to avoid exposure .
Use protective clothing , impervious gloves , protective eye wear , and a NIOSH - approved dust mask .
" Nevertheless , three different variants of the drug have been approved for use in U.S. livestock immediately prior to slaughter .
This is the exact opposite of the rules relating to other livestock drugs , such as antibiotics and hormones , which must be stopped as slaughter nears .
Research has shown that up to 20 percent of ractopamine given to an animal remains active in its meat after slaughter .
More than 1,700 people were poisoned after eating ractopamine - fed pigs in 1998 , according to the Sichuan Pork Trade Chamber of Commerce .
Also of concern is the implications of " adding these drugs to waterways or well water supplies -- via contaminated animal feed and manure runoff -- when this class of drugs is so important in treating children with asthma , " said David Wallinga , MD , of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy .
Ractopamine is sold under three brand names , all made by the same company : Paylean , Optaflexx and Tomax .
Paylean is fed to pigs for the last 28 days of their lives , Optaflexx to cattle for the last 28 to 42 , and Tomax to turkeys for the last 7 to 14 .
According to manufacturer Elanco Animal Health ( a division of Eli Lilly ) , fully 45 percent of U.S. pigs and 30 percent of non -grass - fed cattle receive some form of ractopamine .
Elanco was also the maker of Stilbosol , also known as diethylstilbestrol or DES , an estrogen drug widely prescribed to pregnant women starting in the 1940s .
In 1971 , the drug was shown to cause birth defects , but the company did not cease production until 1997 .
The company also recently purchased the rights to recombinant bovine growth hormone ( rBST ) , also known as Posiliac , from Monsanto .
Noting this connection , " CounterPunch " author Martha Rosenberg draws parallels between the approval processes for rBST and ractopamine .
" Like rBST , ractopamine increases profits despite greater livestock death and disability , " she writes .
" Like rBST , food consumers are metabolic , neurological and carcinogen guinea pigs so that agribusiness can make a profit .
And like rBST , ' Mothers Of Growing Children ' was not marked as a visiting group on the Food Safety and Inspection Service 's public calendar next to the ag lobbyists .
" A full one - third of all Food Safety and Inspection Service meetings in January 2009 took place with Elanco lobbyists .
U.S. farmers have complained that ractopamine induces hyperactivity , muscle damage and even a 10 percent death rate in their pigs and cattle , a concern confirmed by a 2003 study published in the The FDA even acknowledged these effects in 2002 , when it accused Elanco of concealing data from the agency .
It referenced complaints such as , " animals are down and shaking , " and " pig vomiting after eating feed with Paylean . "
" Our representatives requested a complete and accurate list of all your [ Good Laboratory Practices ] studies involving Paylean ... .
In response , your firm supplied to our representatives multiple lists which differed in the names of the studies and their status .
In addition , your firm could not locate or identify documents pertaining to some of the studies , " the FDA 's Division of Compliance director wrote .
Yet none of this stopped the agency from approving the drug in 2003 for cattle , and then again for turkeys in 2009 .

Syria 's record on freedom and human rights has failed to improve in the 10 years since President Bashar al - Assad came to power , according to Human Rights Watch .
The agency delivered what it called a " bleak " verdict on Assad 's record on political and human rights activity , freedom of expression , torture and the treatment of the country 's Kurdish minority .
Virtually nothing has been done in the last decade , the report concludes .
Assad , who took over from his father , Hafez , on 17 July 2000 , promised greater transparency and democracy but has failed to deliver them , the watchdog says .
In the last few weeks alone Syrian courts separately gave three years in jail to two leading human rights lawyers , Haytham al - Maleh , 78 , and Muhanad al - Hasani , 42 , for criticising the country 's human rights record .
Repression has continued despite a thaw since 2007 in relations with both the US and EU , which want Syria 's co-operation on the Middle East peace process , Iraq and other regional issues , and regularly send senior officials to meet Assad .
Pro-forma protests by western governments are simply ignored .
Human rights abuses are less severe than in the 1980s when security forces carried out large - scale murders and disappearances , especially of Islamist opponents .
But a state of emergency introduced in 1962 remains in force .
This allows security agencies to make arrests without warrants and to torture with impunity .
HRW called for an independent investigation into the fate of detainees believed to have been killed in a riot at Sednaya prison two years ago .
Media censorship remains prevalent and covers websites such as Facebook and YouTube .
Journalists and bloggers are arrested and tried in a state security court for exercising their right to freedom of expression .
Politically , Syria remains a de facto single - party state with only the Ba'ath party able to operate freely .
Assad – who won a second presidential term in an uncontested referendum in 2007 – says his priority is economic reform and blames regional circumstances such as the invasion of Iraq and conflict with Israel for holding up reforms he wanted to implement .
Syria 's 1.7 million Kurds , the biggest non-Arab ethnic minority in the country , face routine discrimination and harrasssment .
Large numbers remain stateless despite a presidential promise to tackle their plight .
" President Assad has no excuse to continue to stall on needed reforms to his country 's human rights record , " said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director at HRW .
" Now that he has emerged from his internationally imposed isolation , he should open up his country .
" Whether Assad wanted to be a reformer but was hampered by an entrenched old guard or has been just another Arab ruler unwilling to listen to criticism , the outcome for Syria 's people is the same : no freedom , no rights .
Assad 's record after 10 years is that he has done virtually nothing to improve his country 's human rights record . "
In the Bible we find that :
Males and females were both created in the image of God .
Women had the right to own land .
Received inheritance .
Were prophetesses ( in both testaments ) .
Were judges .
Were disciples .
Were deaconesses .
Were teachers .
Worked and owned their own businesses .
Women were present at the day of Pentecost .
Books of the Bible are named after women .
Women were the first at the empty tomb while the male apostles were hiding in fear .
For these facts , see : Genesis 1:27 ; Exodus 15:20 ; Numbers ch. 27 ; 2nd Kings 22:14 ; 2nd Chronicles 34:22 ; Job 42:15 ; Proverbs 31:16 ; Isaiah 8:3 ; Judges 4:4 ; Luke 2:36 ; Romans 16:1 - 2 ; Acts 1:12 - 14 , 2:1 , 16:14 , 21:7-9 , 9:36 , 18:26 ; Titus 2:3-4 .
Also note that while Pliny the Younger ( Plinius Secundus ) was Governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor in 112 AD he wrote to Emperor Tarjan in Epistles 10.96 , referring to Christians he writes of “ two female slaves , who were styled deaconesses . ”
This again demonstrates a continued Christian practice of having women in leadership and teaching roles ; to whatever extent .
Now , the typical [ pseudo ] skeptic will read this and will refuse to be confused by facts but will dismiss it by asking about things that pertain to roles and not to ontology .

Israel is prepared to apologize to Turkey for the flotilla incident and to compensate the families of the injured parties , Turkish newspaperreported on Friday .
Industry , Trade and Labor Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer 's office has denied the reports .
According to a different Turkish paper , , during the secret meeting between Industry , Trade and Labor Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in Brussels , Davutoglu threatened that Israel - Turkey relations may worsen , with Turkey closing its airspace to commerical flights , as well as military ones , should Israel fail to apologize .
reported that Ben-Eliezer signaled that Israel is willing to apologize , and even pay the families of those inured in the IDF raid on the However , Ben-Eliezer has denied that Israel will compensate those injured on the flotilla .
" No one intends to do that , and the minister did not promise anything , " Ben-Eliezer 's spokesman said .
“ There will be a second meeting if the Israeli side takes a step toward [ meeting ] our demands , ” a Turkish diplomatic source toldon Thursday .
“ We do not categorically dismiss meeting with Israeli officials at this level . ” also reported that Israel initiated the clandestine meeting , despite the fact that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu 's office stated that it Turkey made the first contact .
In October 's Action Comics 894 , the DC Universe 's baldest baddie , Lex Luthor , will meet an unlikely guest star ... Death from Neil Gaiman 's Sandman .
These characters come from two very different corners of comicdom , but their confluence is a win for readers .
Advertisement
In Paul Cornell 's current run on Action Comics , Lex is attempting to unlock the secrets of the Black Lanterns , who unceremoniously trampled all over the DCU during Blackest Night .
Cornell ( Doctor Who , Captain Britain and MI:13 ) had this to say about Neil Gaiman allowing him use everyone 's favorite ( and gothiest ) anthropomorphic representation of mortality :
I knew I wanted to take him to areas he had n't been , and one of those areas was the supernatural / the theological .
I initially thought , " Oh , there 's the Black Racer for Kirby 's Fourth World books !
The guy on the skis - that 's the personification of Death there . "
I had happily been thinking of pitching that , and then suddenly it occurred to me that there 's another Death , is n't there , that 's from even further across the reach of the DC Universes [...]
Then I set up to talk to Neil and had a word with Neil , not expecting him to say yes , but he said yes !

This is n't the first time Neil Gaiman 's Endless have crossed over into the mainstream DCU — indeed , Dream appeared in Grant Morrison 's 1998 run on JLA — but this is the first time in a good long while .
Also , the team up of Death and Lex is an odd mix .
Death is the personification of dying ( who happens to look like Siouxsie Sioux ) .
At a certain juncture in his career , Lex was so down - and - out that he spent a good portion of his time screaming at Superman about peanut butter recipes .
The point is , these two characters come from different traditions .
Death comes from the late 80s / early 90s proto-Vertigo DCU and dresses like a hot alternate dimension Robert Smith .
Lex Luthor 's been part of the Superman mythos for 70 years and has suffered a lifetime worth of undignified merchandising .
It 's the commercial meets the critically acclaimed .
At first blush , it seems downright sacrilegious to team them up .
Imagine of McG — a director whose career is built on pop panache — announced that he was going to remake 2001 ( but call it 4002 ... " because it 's twice the sequel ! " ) .
The internet would have a fanbolism .
Similarly , Lex has dabbled in pastry theft during his career in supervillainy .
That 's ai n't Vertigo material .

So why am I not worried about this crossover ?
Two reasons .
First , I happen to like Cornell as a writer ( his run on Marvel 's Wisdom was way underrated ) .
And second , I do n't think this crossover will devalue Death .
It 's already been demonstrated that a character can try out different " tenors " and still remain interesting .
Just look what Marvel 's done with the Punisher over the years .
Advertisement
Marvel 's never really known what to do with the Punisher .
He 's too violent for overt superheroics but too lucrative and famous to exile to crime comics .
He fit in during the angsty early 90s ( Anyone remember Hearts of Darkness ?
Punisher + Ghost Rider + Wolverine = anti-hero overload ! ) but was later consigned to the periphery of continuity until Mark Millar brought him back in Civil War .
Since then , Marvel 's been able to divide Frank Castle between two titles : Frankencastle ( which depicts the Punisher as a shambling undead vigilante in the main Marvel U. ) and PunisherMAX ( which is a " real world " take on Frank ) .
In a way , Marvel 's imposed a form of selective continuity on Frank .
Fans can take their Punisher with a side of the supernatural or leave him in a non-superheroic reality .
Both are valid takes , complete with their own continuity and tenor .

What does the Punisher have to do with Death and Lex ?
By placing this incongruous duo in one tale , DC is increasing the spectrum of stories that can be told with these characters .
Who knows ?
If this goes well , maybe Gaiman will greenlight more Endless tales down the road .
Options are good .
Some folks like their Batman dark 'n ' gritty .
I like my Batman fighting Swamp Thing .
And with DC reincorporating Vertigo - lite characters back into the DCU , such editorial barriers will appear more and more arbitrary .
We often hear that one of the biggest drains on wealth is paying fees .
I ca n’t think of anyone who likes paying fees .
For those who follow sound principles of money management , fees should n’t be much of a problem .
After all , when you are living within your means , you should n’t have to worry about fees , right ?
No need for overdraft fees , since you never overdraw your account .
This is what I thought until a couple of weeks ago .
My finances have a lot of automation to them , and sometimes I do n’t go in and double check to make sure that everything is as it should be .
I just assume that the direct deposit from my husband ’s work will come through , and that all of my transfers to and from various places will arrive on time .
Unfortunately , that ’s not how it played out for me a couple of weeks ago .
A clerical error meant that my husband ’s pay did n’t come as expected ( it ’s in the bank now , coming two weeks later than expected ) , and the fact that it takes three to four business days for money to move between PayPal and my bank account did n’t help matters .
And in between , all of my automatic withdrawals , from the mortgage payment to the IRA contribution , all came out as scheduled .
I found myself paying overdraft fees , and in the embarrassing position of going into the bank to find out if some of the fees could be waived ( some of them were ) .
Why I Decided to Add Overdraft Protection to My Account
Up until two weeks ago , I did n’t have overdraft protection .
I agreed to the “ standard overdraft services ” provision that allows the bank to accept transactions , and I thought that was good enough .
Because overdrawing my account is not something that happens .
However , with my mostly automated finances , and the unpredictability of mine and my husband ’s pay ( I ’m self - employed and he ’s an adjunct ) , I ran into an unexpected cash flow issue .
So I bit the bullet and signed up for the true overdraft protection for my account .
Here is what overdraft protection usually consists of these days :
Overdraft protection is a line of credit .
It is treated as a revolving line of credit , so it is actually a loan .
That means you pay interest on your balance .
Your interest rate varies according to a number of factors , including your credit score .
There is often an annual fee .
I ’m not thrilled about my annual fee , but it ’s less than my overdraft fees ended up being .
If something similar happens again ( and I will be taking steps to ensure it does n’t ) , at least I ’ll come out ahead .
If it does n’t , I guess the annual fee is worth my peace of mind .
An automatic transfer takes place , sending money to your checking account , if you overdraw your account .
At some banks , you will pay a small fee if this happens .
If you have the wherewithal to transfer the money on your own , before it kicks in , you do n’t usually pay a per-transaction fee , though you still pay interest .
So I have the overdraft protection .
This situation really scared me , and I do n’t want to be unprepared in the future .
While I hope never to need the overdraft protection , right now it ’s really helping me feel better .
And , of course , I will be keeping a better watch on the account to make sure that we really have the money that we should have .
Should You Get Overdraft Protection ?
Let ’s say you ’re going out to eat for lunch .
You have a nice lunch with your coworkers .
The bill is a reasonable $ 12 .
You swipe your card for your tasty lunch and you move on with your life .
You did n’t know you ’re overdrawn , and you ’re going to be facing those fees .
Your affordable work lunch for $ 12 just became a $ 45 lunch .
If you keep swiping your card before you get a notification or you check your account , you could rack up three or four overdraft fees before you catch the problem .
If you make a simple mistake when it comes to your checking account , you ’re going to be facing an overdraft fee .
Every bank handles overdraft fees differently , but the average fee is a little more than $ 33 .
That ’s a huge slap on the wrist for a simple mistake , right ?
Everyone makes mistakes .
You probably think there is no way you could ever make a mistake like overdrawing on your bank account , but it happens to millions of Americans every year .
It ’s easy to lose track of how much you have in your account or accidentally forget to transfer money from one account to another .
If you ’re trying to decide if you should spring for the overdraft protection , you need to decide if the fees are worth it .
If you ’re someone who stays on top of your accounts and checks them every day , then it ’s probably not worth the money to get overdraft protection .
On the other hand , you ’re more laid back with your finances then those overdraft protection fees might be worth the cost .
There are some alternatives to having to pay for the overdraft protection .
A lot of banks will let you sync your credit card account to your checking account .
With these banks , if you overdraft on your checking account , they will be able to use your credit card or savings account to pay for those additional charges .
With most banks , they will offer this feature at no additional cost .
Another way you can skip the overdraft protection fees and still avoid the fees is to set up alerts on your account .
Every bank has an app or alert system you can use .
You can set up alerts on your account in case they drop below a certain amount .
You can set them up to email you or text you .
This is one of the easiest and simplest ways you can ensure you do n’t overdraft your account and have to pay those massive fees every time you swipe your card .
Bank Overdraft Rules
About 10 years ago , banks automatically enrolled members in overdraft protection .
Now , though , consumers will have to agree to opt-in to such overdraft programs , at least as far as debit cards are concerned .
This means that if you do not explicitly accept the idea that banks can let transactions go through ( and charge you a fee ) , you will be cut off if you do n’t have enough money in your account to cover a purchase .
Your transaction will be denied , and you will either have to pay with another card or cash or reduce the amount of your order .
If banks let debit card transactions go through , and you have not opted in , then they can not charge you overdraft fees .
When you open a new account , you will have to indicate whether you want to use overdraft protection .
For those with existing accounts , be on the lookout for information about the new overdraft rules .
Financial institutions are being required to notify you of the changes , and ask if you want to opt in .
As you might imagine , financial institutions are doing their best to convince you that you “ need ” this “ protection ” , playing up the convenience of being able to continue buying things even though you do n’t actually have the money in your account .
These rules also apply to ATM transactions .
If you do not opt in for standard overdraft protection , you will not be able to use the ATM to overdraw your account .
It is worth noting that if you do opt in , and agree to these standard overdraft practices , you can cancel at any time .
You can also choose to opt in later if you decide that the convenience is worth the high price .
This is a good time to re-evaluate your money management and spending practices and consider keeping better track of your accounts so that you do not spend more than you have in your account .
Banks Can Still Collect Some Overdraft Fees
While these rules will affect your debit card purchases , there are still ways for financial institutions to collect fees on overdrafts .
You may not opt in for overdraft protection , but it important to note that the new rules do not apply to checks that you write , or to ACH billing .
This means that your checks and automatic billing arrangements can still come with overdraft charges , rather than being denied , even if you choose not to accept standard overdraft protection .
If you want to cancel overdraft practices on automatic billing and checks , you will have to speak with your bank specifically about their practices .
However , banks are under no obligation to deny automatic billing transactions or checks that will overdraw your account .
Is Overdraft Protection Right for You ?
Many would argue that you should never need overdraft protection , as long as you live within your means and keep tabs on your spending .
For those who habitually engage in overdrawing their accounts , it might actually be best not to opt in .
This could be a chance to let tough love force a change in spending habits .
For those who rarely overdraw their accounts , though , opting in might not be such a bad thing .
It can protect you against mistakes , or the occasional month when your cash flow is a little off .
However , it is important to avoid letting overdrawing your account a regular occurrence .
Evaluate your situation individually , and decide whether or not overdraft protection of this nature would help keep your finances moving smoothly .
What do you think ?
Is overdraft protection worth it ?

A DANCE WITH DRAGONS just got a little shorter .
What 's happened is , I 've decided to move two completed chapters , from Arianne 's POV , out of the present volume and into THE WINDS OF WINTER .
This is something I 've gone back and forth on .
Arianne was n't originally supposed to have any viewpoint chapters in DANCE at all , but there 's this ... hmmm , how vague do I want be ?
VERY vague , I think ... there 's this event that would of necessity provoke a Dornish reaction .
The event was originally going to occur near the end of the book , but in one of my forty - seven restructures I moved it to the late middle instead .
And the timeline then required that the Dornish reaction happen in this book and not the next one , so I wrote the two Arianne chapters and was going to write a third ... and a chapter from another POV that would be a necessary complement to them , and ... But no , I 've restructured again , and put the original precipitating event back close to the end of the book .
Which means the Arianne chapters can be returned to WINDS , where I had 'em originally .
It also means that I do n't have to write that third Arianne chapter and the complementary chapter from the other POV ... not yet , anyway ... which moves DANCE two chapters closer to completion .
( The move did mean I had to revise two chapters from another POV , which took place after the event in last week 's draft , but now take place before said event , but fortunately that was just a matter of tweaking a couple of lines ) .
I suppose this is a good news / bad news situation .
Bad news for those who want DANCE to be really , really , really long , as long as STORMS OF SWORDS or longer .
This move makes DANCE four chapters ( two written , one partly written , one entirely unwritten ) shorter .
But it 's good news for DANCE , since I 'm now two chapters ( the ones I had n't finished ) closer to completion .
And hey , it 's even good news for WINDS OF WINTER , since I now have four chapters done for that one ( an Arya , a Sansa , and two Ariannes ) .
This , of course , is assuming that I do n't change my mind again tomorrow and put everything back the way it was last week .
I am dancing , boys and girls , I 'm dancing as fast as I can .

David Cameron's " big society in action " answer to police budget cuts has been revealed as a plan to appeal to the public to take part in " do - it - yourself " policing ‑ and perhaps even go on patrol with uniformed officers .
A radical police reform white paper published by the home secretary , Theresa May , says that she wants to explore new ideas including creating a reserve army of volunteers prepared to act as community crime fighters along similar lines to fire reservists who help staff some neighbourhood fire stations .
The idea for greater public involvement in policing emerged as the home secretary 's Liberal Democrat coalition partners warned that the current state of her proposals to introduce directly - elected police and crime commissioners are in danger of giving a green light to " Judge Dredd populists " .
The proposal for directly - elected police commissioners , who will have the power to hire and fire chief constables , is already under attack from senior police officers and Conservative - led local government .
The unexpected outspoken criticism from the Liberal Democrats reflects the coalition 's failure to agree the detail on the checks and balances that are to be put in place to avoid " populist politicians turning individual forces into their personal fiefdom " .
The Home Office consultation paper , published on Monday , says each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales will elect the new commissioners – who will replace existing police authorities – every four years , starting in May 2012 , for a maximum of two terms .
The commissioners will be powerful new figures who can not only sack a chief constable if necessary but also set budgets and force priorities .
The Home Office paper says that a new police and crime panel will monitor the commissioner in each force .
The panels will be free to make any concerns public and in cases of serious misconduct to call in the Independent Police Complaints Commission to investigate their commissioner .
But how these panels are to be appointed and who will serve on them remains a stumbling block .
The Lib Dem home affairs spokesman , Tom Brake , said that without " tough checks and balances " the proposals could be seen as " a green light for the election of Judge Dredd characters more interested in populism than effective co-operative policing " .
In the Commons he warned that there was a danger of populist politicians turning forces into their personal fiefdom .
The Association of Chief Police Officers greeted the proposals very cautiously saying they had to be examined in detail to see how they could " maintain operational independence against the practical reality of directly - elected police and crime commissioners . "
The Tory - led Local Government Association estimated the elections would cost £ 50 m – the cost of 700 police officers .
The home secretary defended her proposals insisting that by replacing " invisible police authorities " with elected commissioners would forge a direct link between the police and the public and replace bureaucracy with democratic accountability .
But she seemed less attached to the idea floated in the police reform paper to recruit a " do - it - yourself " reserve army of policing volunteers , saying it was a matter for consultation .
The scheme was first raised in a Conservative pre-election policy document which talked of creating a " new cadre of police reserves " .
The consultation paper says that neighbourhood policing is key to David Cameron 's " big society ... we want more active citizens taking part in joint patrols with the police , looking out for their neighbours and passing on safety tips as part of neighbourhood watch groups or as community crime fighters , " it says .
May said she wanted to see more special constables , whose numbers have plummeted from 67,000 in the 1950s to 15,000 today .
But the paper adds that they want to go further and explore new ideas to " unlock the potential of police volunteers in the workforce , for example , as police " reservists " .
It says they would be a " clear manifestation of the ' big society ' in action " .
The public are also to be asked to get involved through " virtual beat meetings " with the police using Facebook and Twitter .
The Home Office paper confirms a shakeup of national policing bodies with a new National Crime Agency to replace the existing Serious and Organised Crime Agency .
The NCA will also have a border policing unit and take in other functions such as managing the national DNA database currently carried out by the National Police Improvement Agency , which is to be phased out .
The Association of Chief Police Officers , which is currently a limited company , is to lose key functions including its role in monitoring domestic extremism and will be established on a more accountable basis involving the new commissioners .
What is it that woke them up finally , after all these years of denial , during which they insisted that racism was a thing of the past ?
Was it the research indicating that job applicants with white sounding names have a 50 percent better chance of being called back for an interview than their counterparts with black - sounding names , even when all qualifications are the same ?
No .
Was it the study that found white job applicants with criminal records have a better chance of being called back for an interview than black applicants without one , even when all the qualifications are the same ?
No .
Was it the massive nationwide study that estimated at least 1 million cases of blatant job discrimination against blacks , Latinos and Asian Americans each year , affecting roughly one - in - three job seekers of color ?
No .
Is it the fact that black males with college degrees are almost twice as likely as their white male counterparts to be out of work ?
No .
Is it the data indicating that Chinese - American professionals earn less than 60 percent as much as their white counterparts , even though the Chinese Americans , on average , have more education ?
No .
Was it the study that found the lightest - skinned immigrants to the United States make as much as 15 percent more than the darkest , even when the immigrants in question have the same level of education , experience and measured productivity ?
No .
Perhaps they finally stumbled upon the evidence suggesting millions of cases of race - based housing discrimination against people of color each year , and this is what has them so incensed ?
No .
Or maybe their anger is due to the reports of blatant racism practiced by Wells Fargo , which was deliberately roping black borrowers ( to whom they referred as " mud people " ) into high - cost loans , targeting them for these instruments , and even falsifying credit histories to make black applicants look like greater risks than they were , so as to justify the scam ?
No .
Was it the study demonstrating that e-mail inquiries about rental property submitted by people with white sounding names were 60 percent more likely than those with black sounding names to get a positive response from a landlord ( meaning an indication that a unit was available for rent ) , even when the housing had been previously advertised as available ?
No .
Maybe they ’re furious because of the way whites in the New Orleans area conspired after the flooding of the city to keep blacks from returning and being able to find housing on equitable terms , if at all ?
No .
Or maybe it ’s because of the data from the Justice Department , to the effect that blacks are far more likely than whites to have their cars and persons searched after a traffic stop , even though whites , when searched , are more than four times as likely to have drugs or other illegal contraband on us ?
No .
Well then , perhaps it ’s the recent revelations that police in New York City are blatantly profiling blacks and Latinos , stopping and frisking them in massive numbers , even though in 90 percent of all cases , the people they stop are released without any charge because they are found to have done nothing illegal ?
No .
Is the source of their anger the data showing that although whites and blacks use and sell drugs at roughly the same rates , African Americans are anywhere from 2.8 to 5.5 times more likely than whites to be arrested for a drug offense , depending on the year ?
Or perhaps the state level data indicating that in nine states , blacks are arrested at more than seven times the rate of whites , and in Minnesota and Iowa at rates that are more than eleven times greater than white arrest rates for drugs ?
Or perhaps the additional data that blacks are more than 10 times as likely as whites to be sent to prison for drug offenses , despite relatively equivalent rates of drug crimes ?
Or the fact that a majority of persons admitted to prison for drug offenses are black , even though there are about six times more white users nationwide ?
No .
Maybe they 're beside themselves over the fact that millions of black men who are ex-felons and have paid their debt to society are permanently blocked from voting thanks to disenfranchisement laws that were devised for blatantly racist reasons ?
Surely they are upset that these laws have led to blacks being denied the right to vote after serving their time at a rate that is 7 times the national average ?
No .
Perhaps they ’re enraged by the way white police officers conspired to murder a black man in New Orleans after Katrina , and then cover up the crime , or the way other whites formed a vigilante terror squad and went hunting for black people in the aftermath of the flooding ?
No .
Maybe it was that racist e-mail sent by the white Boston police officer to the reporter at the Boston Globe , in which he called Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates a “ banana eatin ’ jungle monkey ? ”
No .
Then maybe it was the story about that high ranking racist in the Chicago police force who OK ’d the torture of black men to extract confessions for years ?
No .
Then I bet they must have finally seen that story about the Philadelphia cop who refers to black folks as animals and niggers .
That ’s it , right ?
No .
Could it be that they ’ve read and been moved by the dozens of studies that show the cumulative health effects of racism and discrimination on people of color , and which indicate that doctors do indeed treat patients of color differently , and worse , than their white counterparts ?
Or perhaps the research that finds how even black women with college degrees , decent jobs and good incomes have infant mortality rates for their children that are higher than the rates for white women who dropped out before high school ?
And the way that researchers believe stresses associated with racial discrimination are implicated in the worse fetal and neo-natal health of these mother 's children ?
No .
Perhaps it ’s the research that shows black students being suspended and expelled from school at far higher rates than white students , even though there are no significant differences in the rates at which students of different races violate serious school rules ?
No .
Maybe it 's the research indicating that teachers set lowered expectations for children with black - sounding names , independent of observed ability , and even when compared to the child 's own siblings who have less identifiably black names .
These lowered expectations , based on presumptions of lowered competence and ability then result in lower performance by the stigmatized students .
No .
Or maybe it was that troubling story on CNN about how white children and even many children of color seem to prefer white skin , and think that children with black skin are bad , dirty , mean and ugly ?
No .
Well then it must be the blatant stuff .
Maybe they finally got around to looking at those images of Tea Party protesters and other assorted conservatives coming to rallies with signs advocating the lynching of Democratic party leaders , or portraying the President as an African witch doctor ?
Or maybe somebody informed them of all the times that conservative and Republican Party activists have sent around blatantly racist e-mails lately , like those portraying the white house lawn covered in watermelons , or once again with the witch doctor imagery , or likening Michelle Obama to an ape , or picturing the President as a pair of " spook eyes " against a black background ?
No .
Maybe they 're angry at Tea Party leader Mark Williams for calling the President an " Indonesian Muslim " and a " welfare thug ? "
I mean , that 's pretty racialized rhetoric , right ?
No .
Or maybe it was the Tea Party leader in Ohio who tweeted about how he wants to shoot Hispanic immigrants , to whom he refers as " spicks ? " ( sic )
No .
Well then surely it must have been the story about Tea Party candidate for Governor in New York who sent e-mails picturing the President dressed as a pimp and featuring a group of African tribesman performing a traditional dance , which he referred to as the " Obama Inauguration Rehearsal ? "
No .
Perhaps what has them angry is the statement by that Arizona Congressman , to the effect that black folks were better off under slavery than they are today ?
No .
Maybe it was because of those guys over at the popular right - wing website , FreeRepublic.com who called the President 's daughter , Malia , " typical ghetto trash , " and a " whore " whose mother likes to entertain her by " making monkey sounds ? "
No .
Or perhaps they finally had enough when they heard about how Rep.
Ciro Rodriguez was called a " wetback " by one of his constituents and told to go back to Mexico ?
No .
Or maybe it was that lawmaker in South Carolina who called both President Obama and Republican Gubernatorial candidate ( and Indian American ) Nikki Haley , " ragheads ? "
No .
Or perhaps they 're upset about how the guy who sponsored the law in Arizona , ostensibly to catch " illegal immigrants " ( a law they support ) , turns out to be pals with neo -Nazis ?
Or the fact that the organization that takes credit for writing the bill has longstanding ties to blatant racists and hate groups ?
No .
Or maybe it was the story about how National Review columnist John Derbyshire told Harvard law students that black achievement lags behind white achievement because blacks are biologically inferior to whites ?
No .
Well perhaps it was that story about the motorists in Prescott , Arizona who continually shouted racial slurs at artists who were painting a mural on the walls of a school , which featured children of color who go there ?
And certainly they must have been upset about the fact that initially the school was actually planning to lighten the subjects ' skin color so as to appease locals and a right wing talk show host ?
No .
Or maybe they 're irate because of the report that employees of the Department of Homeland Security have posted blatantly racist comments about Latino immigrants on web boards ?
No .
Surely it must be because of the evidence that uniformed American soldiers are joining up with neo -Nazi organizations and even flaunting their membership in such groups ?
No .
It is none of this .
Neither the evidence of systemic discrimination against people of color in every walk of American life , nor the repeated examples of blatant racism directed towards people of color individually moves them .
But they 're angry nonetheless about racism in America .
They 're especially angry about the tax being placed on those who use tanning salons .
Because this is racist .
Against white people .
No , seriously .
Oh , and the President criticized a white police officer for arresting a black man for a crime that , turns out , the black man did n't actually commit , according to state law .
That Obama would do such a thing -- namely , criticize an officer for making an unjustified arrest -- means that white police officers are " under assault " from Obama , and that the President is trying to " destroy " the white officer , no doubt because he 's white .
Oh , and since people of color disproportionately lack health care coverage , the President 's plan for expanding coverage is obviously a racist scheme to get reparations for slavery .
Oh , and the President is deliberately trying to destroy the economy so as to pay back white people for slavery and hundreds of years of oppression .
Oh , and two black kids beat up a white kid on a bus in Belleville , Illinois -- something that is obviously due to Obama being President .
Oh , and the President picked Eric Holder as Attorney General .
Since Holder has said Americans have often been " cowards " when it comes to discussing race , this proves that Holder is racist against white people , even though he did n't mention white people .
He said Americans , and Americans means white people .
So he 's a bigot .
And so is Obama for picking him .
Oh , and the President nominated Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court .
And she 's a Latina , who notes that she sees the world through the lens of her experience , and that she hopes that experience would positively inform her decision - making .
And that means she 's a bigot .
And the fact that Obama nominated her , as well as Eric Holder , proves that he " views white men as the problem " in America , and that the only way you can get promoted by Obama is " by hating white people . "
Like Tim Geithner , who most definitely hates your honky ass .
Oh , and the President also nominated Elena Kagan , and Kagan once worked for Justice Thurgood Marshall , and Marshall once said the Constitution as originally conceived -- which , ya know , excluded blacks from citizenship -- was flawed .
Imagine .
And this means that Marshall was anti-white , and anyone who worked for him must be too .
Oh , and the Obama Justice Department dropped criminal voter intimidation charges against three members of the New Black Panther Party in Philadelphia ( while obtaining an injunction against a fourth member ) .
So this proves the Administration is allied with the Panthers , whose Philly leader proclaims that he " hates all white people , " and Obama probably agrees with him , and is refusing to prosecute because he does n't care about white folks ' voting rights .
In fact , the New Black Panthers are part of Obama 's " army of thugs . "
Even though the same Philly leader of the group did n't support Obama for President , and has called Obama a " puppet " and " slavemaster . "
And of course , as a point of fact , the criminal charges against the other three Panthers were dropped by the Bush Department of Justice .
And there have been no voters who actually claim to have been intimidated by the Panthers .
And even a leading conservative Republican on the Civil Rights Commission says the incident is much ado about nothing .
Oh , and since the Justice Department is considering bringing federal charges against the white officer who killed Oscar Grant - - a black man -- in cold blood in Oakland last year , this proves that we 've returned to the 1950s , only this time it 's whites who are the victims of racist oppression .
Because it 's oppression to bring charges against a white cop who kills someone .
Naturally .
Yes indeed , they all agree , Obama is a " reverse racist " who has a deep - seated hatred of white people , and who is like Hitler , and we know this because he 's proposing a national service corps to help work on various community problems , and this is just like the Nazi SS , well , except for the murdering part .
Or if not Hitler , then at the very least he 's just like an " African colonial despot " .
And for sure , Obama is the reason race relations are so strained : not because of the ongoing discrimination against people of color , which the data indicates is commonplace , or because of the incendiary rhetoric coming from conservative commentators .
But because of Barack Obama .
Race relations could never be strained by say , for instance , having a white talk show host fantasize about murdering a black congressman with a shovel .
Or by another host calling undocumented migrants from Mexico " invasive species " .
Or by spreading lies about how 5 million so - called " illegal aliens " were given subprime mortgages , as a way to blame the undocumented for the housing meltdown , even though there is no evidence whatsoever to support the fabricated claim .
Or by alleging that ACORN ( a community - based organization comprised mostly of people of color ) committed massive voter fraud so as to help elect Obama , even though there is no evidence that a single illegitimate vote was cast due to ACORN 's voter registration efforts , and despite the fact that when a few ACORN operatives filed phony voter registration cards , it was ACORN itself that alerted election officials to the problem
Or by a prominent conservative commentator insisting that white men are experiencing the same kind of oppression that blacks faced for years , even as that commentator has previously reminisced fondly about the days of segregation .
Or by another radio host and prominent conservative author blaming " multicultural " people for " destroying " the country , or calling Arab Muslims " non-humans , " or fantasizing about killing people in the " civil rights business . "
Or by another radio host and prominent conservative author referring to the mostly black residents of New Orleans , in the wake of Katrina as " worthless parasites " and " human parasitic garbage " because of their high rates of welfare receipt .
Even though , according to Census data , there were only 4600 households in all of the city receiving cash welfare at the time of the flooding , which was less than 4 percent of all black households in the city , and whose annual benefits came to only around $ 2800 per year .
Or by walking around with a sign suggesting that President Obama intends to put white people into slavery .
Or by saying that President Obama only won the election because he 's black , and if he were n't black , he'd be a tour guide in Honolulu .
Or by saying that the only reason Colin Powell endorsed Obama was as an act of racial bonding .
Or by saying that Oprah Winfrey is also successful only because she 's black .
Or by blaming the economic collapse on fair lending laws and lending to minorities , even though all the evidence suggests such laws and such loans had nothing to do with the housing or larger economic crises .
Or perhaps by having a right - wing talk show host announce a plan for conservatives to " take back the civil rights movement , " and compare himself to Martin Luther King Jr .
This , even though conservatives were almost uniformly opposed to the movement and King , and even though the talk show host 's favorite authors , whose work he promotes regularly , viewed the movement as a communist conspiracy and referred to civil rights activists as animals .
Or by another conservative comparing himself to Dr. King , and speaking of how much he respects King 's legacy , even as he -- the conservative -- has said he believes private businesses should have the right to discriminate on the basis of race .
No , none of those things could strain race relations , or further racism .
And certainly not when compared to a tanning booth tax .
While on the face of it , these kinds of right - wing inanities may seem so absurd as to hardly merit being taken seriously , it 's important to step back and think about the internal logic of even the most outlandish claims .
I mean , no one can honestly believe that health care reform is reparations .
After all , what the hell kind of reparations is it where you have to get sick first in order to get paid ?
That 's not a good hustle .
And no one can really believe that some white kid got beat up on a bus because it 's " Obama 's America , " as if the President had sent a text message to those black guys saying : HEY , YNOT BEAT SUM CRAKA ASS 4 ME , U DIG ?
But the intellectual strength of the claims is not the issue .
It does n't matter .
From a political perspective , even the most insane - sounding claim about Obama 's supposed hatred for white people makes sense .
It 's a perfect way to prime white racial fears and anxieties , to say , in effect , they 're coming for your money white folks , and then your children .
In a nation where the population will be half people of color within 25 - 30 years , and where the popular culture is now thoroughly multicultural ( and thus many of the icons do n't look the way they used to ) , and where the President does n't fit a lot of people 's conception of what such a person is supposed to look like , and where the economy is in the toilet for millions , playing upon white anxiety is the perfect recipe for political mobilization .
They 've said very clearly that they want their country back .
And if we who oppose the right do n't challenge these folks for the racists they are , or continue to shy away from making race an issue ( as if it were n't already ) , they just might get it .

Why has dispensary owner Wanda James so actively promoted medical marijuana use for veterans with post - traumatic stress disorder ?
One reason :
She and husband / partner Scott Durrah both served in the military .
So she 's thrilled that the Veterans Administration is loosening rules concerning vets with PTSD and MMJ .
But she sees this as only a first step .
The next one ?
Removing weed from the list of Schedule I narcotics .
In the past , vets who were caught using medical marijuana risked being denied other treatment from their VA doctors .
Now , as the New York Times reports , a policy tweak means this wo n't happen in the fourteen states , including Colorado , where medical marijuana has been legalized .
The rules are expected to go into effect this week .
" This has been a very long time coming , " says James , who owns Apothecary of Colorado with Durrah .
" And its importance is two - fold .
First of all , it 's important that we get these young men and young women the best help possible with the least amount of side effects .
We want to help them end the trauma in their lives , not continue the addiction trauma " that can come with chemical dependency on narcotic pain medication .
" Plus , we 're getting closer to forcing the federal government to take marijuana off the Schedule I list . "
She 's referring to the Controlled Substances Act.
Schedule I substances are judged to have " no currently accepted medical use " -- and that 's an exceedingly controversial claim when it comes to marijuana .
As noted on the Veterans for Medical Marijuana Access website , the American Medical Association is among the major institutions that supports cannabis rescheduling .

Nonetheless , resistance remains , particularly in Colorado , where the state health department successfully lobbied against adding PTSD as a condition MMJ can treat to a bill to regulate the medical marijuana industry here .
And the department shows no signs of changing its tune .
Earlier this month , a group led by attorney Brian Vicente and Kevin Grimsinger , an Army veteran who lost parts of both legs to an Afghanistan mine , formally presented a petition to the department to add PTSD to the treatable condition list .
No luck so far on that effort .
But James thinks the situation could improve down the line thanks in part to the potential political significance of the VA 's move .
James knows politics , having served as Congressman Jared Polis 's first campaign manager .
She also oversaw the 2006 congressional race for Lieutenant Colonel Jay Fawcett in Colorado Springs -- and she and Durrah serve on the National Finance Committee for none other than President Barack Obama .
From her perspective , the VA 's new policy , while it stops short of giving its own doctors the right to recommend medical marijuana , " establishes that it has medicinal value .
That points to the fact that we need more studies -- and the key to that is to removing it from Schedule I .
" I do n't know any intelligent person who can look at all the evidence about the medical benefits and not come back and at least say , ' We need to study this more , ' " she continues .
" And once we do , I believe we 'll discover that there 's tremendous medicinal value in this plant -- and that will move us in the direction of legalization as we move forward . "
As a legalization booster , James has few peers -- and she 's a good sport , too , having even allowed correspondent Jason Jones to lick her hand during a medical marijuana segment of The Daily Show .
But despite her best outreach efforts , many veterans with PTSD still steer clear of medical marijuana -- and she understands why .
" Vets are interesting people , " she says .
" As military members , we tend to follow rules .
We tend to be the people in society who try to do everything the right way .
If you tell us not to run a red light , we 're not going to do that .
These are responsible people who take being America 's best seriously -- and they do n't want to break the law .
And a lot of them are nervous .
They say , ' Medical marijuana helps me , but I 'm afraid of losing my benefits , afraid of my family being tossed out of the house , afraid of being arrested . '
" When I hear these concerns , it breaks my heart , " James concedes .
" But the more people we can give permission to at least try this , the better off we 're going to be .
And that 'll make it harder for any administration in the future to change things back .
Because if they decide four million people in our population are criminals and they 're going to lock them up , people wo n't accept that . "
Not that she expects a breakthrough overnight .
" As a younger person , in my twenties , I expected change to happen immediately , " she says .
" But change is a process we go through -- and we 're going through that process right now .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
What separates a scientific claim from mere opinion is its ability to be tested by experiment .
No true scientist objects to having his theories verified ; the charlatan is the one with something to hide .
Not surprisingly , purveyors of global warming have proved anything but open .
In the current issue of the peer - reviewed journal Environmental Law and Management , Australian researchers evaluated the community of so - called climate scientists and found them to be “ antagonistic toward the disclosure of information . ”
Professor John Abbot of Central Queensland University , a chemist and lawyer , and biologist Jennifer Marohasy studied the response of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia ( CRU ) and the Met Office - Britain ’s national weather service - to various information requests .
The most noteworthy of these was United Kingdom resident David Holland ’s demand for the raw data underlying the infamous “ hockey stick ” graph that was published in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) assessment reports .
This chart was the centerpiece of the claim that the 20th century was the hottest in a thousand years .
The stir that Mr. Holland ’s request triggered among the scientists who worked on the report was captured in the Climategate e-mails .
“ If they ever hear there is a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK , I think I ’ll delete the file rather than send to anyone , ” CRU scientist Phil Jones wrote in a February 2005 e-mail .
“ We think we ’ve found a way around this . ”
So much for transparency .
Under the British Freedom of Information law , like the similar U.S. statute , information created at the public expense must - with limited exceptions - be made available to the public that paid for it .
At first , the Met Office answered Mr. Holland ’s request for data regarding a relatively uncontroversial chapter in the IPCC report .
When he asked them for similar details regarding the hockey stick , the Met Office got around the law by claiming the data were “ personal information ” generated in the free time of the scientists involved .
When this dodge failed to hold up , the Met Office began claiming that the records had been deleted .
“ Of concern is evidence of a predisposition towards uncooperativeness on the part of the Met Office , which also used spurious claims of deleted correspondence and personal information in attempts to block the release of information , ” Mr. Abbot and Ms. Marohasy wrote .
The attitude is n’t limited to Britain .
The Washington Times asked the White House Council on Environmental Quality for its oldest pending FOIA requests .
Among the top five was an August 26 letter from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce seeking documents related to its work on climate - change legislation and the Environmental Protection Agency ’s so - called greenhouse gas ruling .
None of these simple requests should have been denied or delayed .
Many of those involved in purported climate science seem more preoccupied with advancing a leftist , anti-business legislative agenda than respecting the integrity of the scientific method .
It ’s obvious why .
Their cataclysmic scare stories are unable to withstand scrutiny .
By deleting e-mails and using tricks to hide the inconvenient decline in global temperatures , the climate alarmists prove to be not men of science , but ordinary frauds .

TBS will commemorate late Yankeee owner George Steinbrenner , who died on Tuesday , with a full slate of " Seinfeld " reruns beginning July 19 .
Steinbrenner was known among both his friends and his enemies as " The Boss " because of his ruthless , argumentative management style .
" Seinfeld " lampooned him with a storyline that featured George Constanza ( played by Jason Alexander ) working as an " assistant to the traveling secretary " for the Yankees .
" The Boss " never actually appeared on the show himself .
Steinbrenner was always seen from behind , with " Curb Your Enthusiasm " star and " Seinfeld " co-creator Larry David providing the voice .
Good casting : Steinbrenner was portrayed as an erratic and demanding tyrant .
And he was a fan of his " Seinfeld " caricature .
He filmed a cameo appearance for the show 's seventh season finale in 1996 , but it was left on the cutting room floor .
The scenes were later included on the " Seinfeld " season seven DVD box set .
The Steinbrenner character appeared on 13 episodes of " Seinfeld " including the series finale in 1998 .
TBS will air 10 of them in pairs each night next week from 7 - 8 p.m .
What Is Arnold Palmer Looking At? ( PIC )
Paula Creamer tweeted this pic of herself with fellow LPGA Tour mate ( and penis - trophy kisser ) Cristie Kerr , former NFLer Jerome Bettis , and golfing legend Arnold Palmer .
The four were together at Oakmont prior to the U.S. Open as they put on a clinic for the kids .
And while Bettis , Creamer and Kerr were busy thinking about the kids , Palmer clearly had something else on his mind .
I guess when you are that old , there is no longer a point in hiding your boob - gazing habits .

LHASA , Tibet 
They come by new high - altitude trains , four a day , cruising 1,200 miles past snow - capped mountains .
And they come by military truck convoy , lumbering across the roof of the world .
Han Chinese workers , investors , merchants , teachers and soldiers are pouring into remote Tibet .
After the violence that ravaged this region in 2008 , China ’s aim is to make Tibet wealthier  and more Chinese .
Chinese leaders see development , along with an enhanced security presence , as the key to pacifying the Buddhist region .
The central government invested $ 3 billion in the Tibet Autonomous Region last year , a 31 percent increase over 2008 .
Tibet ’s gross domestic product is growing at a 12 percent annual rate , faster than the robust Chinese national average .
Simple restaurants located in white prefabricated houses and run by ethnic
Han businesspeople who take the train have sprung up even at a remote lake north of Lhasa .
About 1.2 million rural Tibetans , nearly 40 percent of the region ’s population , have been moved into new residences under a “ comfortable housing ” program .
And officials promise to increase tourism fourfold by 2020 , to 20 million visitors a year .
God smiles when the Army spends a half - billion dollars on spy blimps the size of a football field .
I believe that 's the message Northrop Grumman is trying to convey in this illustration accompanying the company 's announcement of a $ 517 million , five - year contract to build three combat airships for the military .
The military already employs a fleet of blimps to look for enemies and relay communications .
But none of them are as big , as high - flying , or as far - seeing as this Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle , or LEMV .
It 's supposed to float at 20,000 feet for up to three weeks at a time , snooping on absolutely everything below with a variety of sensors .
" Basically what we see it as is an unblinking eye , " LEMV project manager Marty Sargent tells Inside Defense .
Sargent figures it would take as many as 12 of the military 's advanced Reaper surveillance drones " to do the same mission that the LEMV would do . "
The first airship is supposed to be inflated around 10 months from now .
Eight months later , the Army hopes to have the first LEMV flying over Afghanistan .
On that day , the clouds will part , the sun will shine , and the cherubs will sing as the unblinking eye begins looking for Taliban .

Tonight 's EcoAdvocates edition includes an outstanding post by boatsie on a successful , creative grassroots approach of Carrotmobs Turning Businesses Green , and Aji provides excellent original reporting on Nixon 's Only Good Thing or why UNDRIP is needed in the U.S .
Some governments have tried to portray UNDRIP as feckless to downgrade its perceived capability as a tool for change .
Concern troll countries have either opposed UNDRIP or begrudgingly signed , only to warn that it will not achieve the intended goals .
Critics try to " play down the significance " of UNDRIP as a nonbinding declaration that has no legal or " practical effect " but is merely " aspirational " with political and moral force .
Yet , some governments refused support due to " legal concerns . "
One thing some fear is disappearing dollar signs .
A universal problem is the theft of natural resources and lands from indigenous peoples by both governments and corporations .
The UNDRIP rights include self - determination ; protection of land , natural resources , and sacred sites ; and a key FPIC right or " free , prior , and informed consent " before indigenous peoples can be removed from their lands .
( For more details , please read the UNDRIP or exmearden 's diary . )
UNDRIP is not feckless .
The UN 's adoption of UNDRIP is a success story of a process that started in 1982 when the UN created a Working Group to address discrimination against indigenous peoples .
( Ojibwa has written about an earlier attempt to address the rights of indigenous peoples back in 1923 . )
Moreover , UN " declarations are often a first step towards binding conventions . "
While UN declarations are generally not legally binding , they are also recognized as providing important standards and a " significant tool " to assist indigenous people to eliminate human rights violations , and combat " discrimination and marginalization . "
UNDRIP provides an international consensus of rules and policies that should be observed as a majority of 144 states adopted it , and some of the no votes and abstentions have been reversed .
UNDRIP in the Courts
As noted by a former judge in New Zealand , UNDRIP will influence laws in countries as the principles of UNDRIP will find their way over time into both statutes and judicial opinions .
In the U.S. , one professor states how UNDRIP may not be enforceable in our courts , but international law and principles are important and relevant when courts address federal Indian law .
[ Source : Ronald Kakungulu , The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples : A New Dawn for Indigenous Peoples Rights ? ( 2009 ) ]
In fact , the principles of UNDRIP have already been advocated in some courts and tribunals .
UNDRIP in the Legislature
In 2008 , Japan , in a resolution linked to UNDRIP , the " House of Representatives officially classified the Ainu as an ' indigenous people ' " and the government created an expert panel to " determine future policies to uphold Ainu rights . "
In New Zealand , laws will be enacted to " define the bounds of engagement with the declaration , " which also presents an opportunity for its citizens to discuss issues avoided for years .
In addition , referenda on informed consent have been organized throughout Guatemala , and in Canada , a proposed bill requires Canadian mining companies to meet human rights standards to qualify for public monies .
UNDRIP in the Private Sector
In the private sector , last May , people from communities in Central America participated in a shareholder meeting of a mining company by proposing the corporation adopt a resolution based on UNDRIP 's principle of free , informed and prior consent about proposed projects .
While only 10 % of the shareholders voted for the resolution , the shareholders learned about the mining 's horrific impacts , including health , social conflict , contaminated water , criminalization of protests and cracked homes .
Support by the U.S. would provide a stronger tool globally , and in the U.S .
How to take action
Please submit written comments before July 15 to participate in the U.S. process to review UNDRIP .
And h/t Winter Rabbit , there is a petition for Congress on the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples .

While 10:10:10 may seem like light years away , there 's still time to get in on the ground floor of what promises to be " the largest day of carbon cutting the world has ever seen . "
As we go to press , 10:10 rapidly approaches 100,000 participants from over 120 countries , with activities ranging from installing solar panels in Kenya to bike repair workshops in San Francisco to organizing global Zero Carbon Concerts .
Here in the US , however , only one state , Washington , has signed up to be a 10:10 hub ; so there 's still great opportunity available for top end organizational expertise .
But if the idea of heading up your state 's 10:10 hub is a tad intimidating , surely most of us could consider signing up organizing a local CarrotMob ..... which just so happens to be 10:10 's number 1 tip for getting involved !
" Carrotmobs are cooler than boycotts " Time Magazine
Carrotmobs are grassroots neighborhood consumer activism .
Put quite simply , the CM model revolves around engaging local businesses in bidding wars to determine which promises to donate the largest percentage of profits into energy efficiency upgrades FOLLOWING a shopping spree by hundreds of consumers participating in a ... you got it .
CarrotMob .
Listen in as founder Brent Schulkin explains :
Check out CM 's successes since 2008 with reports from mobs in such diverse locales as Mexico , Finland , Japan , Thailand , Canada , and Germany link .
In Seattle in 2009 , for example , the Pike Brewing Co. donated 25 % of $ 14,000 post a CarrotMob to energy efficiency and waste reduction while cutting in half the total cost of their retrofits by connecting Pike with Seattle City Light .
And in Munich , Germany last October , Löwenzahn donated 30 % of € 3500 to switch to green electricity , energy efficiency in lighting & refrigeration .
" We can do it with the carrot , not the stick ... it 's positive cooperation .
The best company wins , the consumer wins and the planet wins . "

Nixon's Only Good Thing
by Aji
We joke that it was the only good thing Richard Nixon ever did .
In 1970 , Richard Nixon announced a " New New Deal " for Indians , returning Taos Pueblo 's sacred Blue Lake .
The " New New Deal " was mostly the " Old Old Deal , " but the exception – Blue Lake – demonstrates why signing UNDRIP is so important .
Blue Lake is the sacred heart of Taos Pueblo 's tribal lands .
Trespassing by outsiders desecrates it and dilutes its power .
Maintaining its sanctity is crucial to the Pueblo 's spiritual practices - indeed , to its very identity .
By 1900 , outsiders had built huts , corrals , even outhouses on the lake .
Prospectors illegally built a mine on adjacent tribal lands , jeopardizing the watershed .
In 1906 , Teddy Roosevelt " allocated " Blue Lake to the U.S. Forest Service – which , of course , did not protect Blue Lake 's sanctity : The Forest Service even built living quarters on the shore .
In 1926 , the Pueblo offered to forgo compensation for other stolen lands in exchange for the return of Blue Lake .
The government rejected the offer - and paid no compensation .
In 1933 , Congress passed a weak law protecting " Indian use " of the land ; the government did not issue the necessary permit until 1940 .
In 1951 , the Pueblo sued and won – 14 years later .
In 1965 , the tribe launched a campaign led by Pueblo elder Paul Bernal .
They met repeatedly with members of Congress , federal agencies , Nixon staffers , and ultimately , with President Nixon himself , all to restore spiritual balance to the Pueblo by regaining control of its most sacred space .
On January 3 , 1969 , Rep. James Haley introduced HR 471 , to return Blue Lake to Taos Pueblo .
The bill languished for more than a year ; on January 26 , 1970 , the National Congress of American Indians ( NCAI ) called on President Nixon to create a new " Indian policy , " and to launch it by returning Blue Lake .
On July 8 , 1970 , Nixon endorsed HR 471 as the first step in his " New New Deal " Indian policy .
Members of Congress spent months attempting to block , or at least to dilute , the legislation , but on December 2 , the Senate passed HR 471 by a vote of 70 - 12 .
On December 15 , 1970 , President Nixon signed HR 471 into law .
It may have been the only good thing Richard Nixon ever did . . . but it was a very good thing .

Beware death from above !
So blared science headlines yesterday .
Citing a study in the Journal Icarus that said a huge asteroid perhaps could have a 1 in 1,000 shot of striking earth late in the next century , stories broke such as , " Will a Giant Asteroid Kill Us All in 2182 ? "
" Asteroid Could Destroy Human Life on Earth by 2200 " " Huge asteroid on possible collision course with Earth ( 172 years from now ) " " Mark your calendars : Potentially hazardous asteroid might collide with Earth in 2182 "
They 're correct in that there 's a giant asteroid out there called 1999 RQ36 , and there 's a small chance it might hit us in a just less than couple hundred years .
There 's just one problem :
It is n't news , though you would n't have gotten that from the articles .
The study everyone is referring to came out last year — it was in Icarus last October .
Confused why there was a press release yesterday that blew up into this wave of coverage , I emailed study coauthor Maria Eugenia Sansaturio of the Universidad de Valladolid in Spain to see if there was anything new to report about the asteroid .
Her reply :
The answer to your question is that there is nothing new .
I 'm still trying to understand how this has made it to the international media .
I was contacted by the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology because they wanted to prepare a report on it and inform the Spanish Media , even though the article had been published in 2009 .... and here I am overwhelmed with mails and phone calls from all over the world !
So the risk from 1999 RQ36 is n't exactly new ( and the press release in English caught Sansaturio by surprise , to say the least ) .
Apparently , she says , the study just now got on the SFST radar , and that organization 's release set science publications humming about killer asteroids .
But , whether this asteroid 's path is old news or not , we should n't dawdle in thinking about how we might avoid it or asteroids like it .
In this case , we 've only got 172 years — and we already wasted one year getting the news out .
172 years into the future is a long time , and humans are n't exactly well - known for preparing for future events over those kinds of time scales .
But time is one thing we 'll need if we are to protect future generations from a potentially catastrophic impact event [ Discovery News ] .
Of course , the last time there was a giant hubbub over an asteroid that might kill us all ( we 're looking at you , Apophis ) , subsequently improved data all but ruled out a disaster
.
So do n't panic ; grab a telescope .

Chris Combs , photography editor at National Geographic News , took these amazing shots while on assignment in the Gulf of Mexico .
Via Submitterator , he says :
… researcher Ping Wang pointed me towards his grad student 's work with UV light .
Turns out that the oil glows bright , head - shop fluorescent orange under UV light .
Rip Kirby 's ultra-powerful $ 1800 " Klingon Death Ray " ultraviolet spotlight lit up every particle of oil - stained sand , even in seemingly clean areas , and our footprints showed up Day - Glo orange .
This is n't just for " woah , dude " value .
Applying UV light to contaminated beaches is also a clever way to spot — and clean up — oil that might otherwise go unnoticed by notoriously flimsy human eyes .

" There is hardly anything bad in the world that does n't have
something good connected to it . "
Pete Seeger is one of the world 's quintessential activists ,
having played such an important role in singing the songs and engaging in the
struggles of the civil rights , free speech , human rights , anti-Vietnam War ,
environmental , peace , anti-nuclear , and social justice movements .
He spans
musical eras , from those who inspired him , Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly , to those
he inspired , Joan Baez , Bob Dylan , Martin Luther King , Jr. , Bruce Springsteen , Dave
Mathews , and Ani DiFranco .
Seeger has had an epic life , full of amazing contributions
to our culture and politics .
In person , he conveys a comfortable , homespun way
about himself that puts you at ease .
He is a modest soul , and in conversation
is slow to credit himself on his lifework 's impact , but it can be safely said
that in the 20th century there is no other individual who has so successfully
combined folk music and progressive politics .
In the late 1960s , Seeger shifted away from typical American
folk music , embracing African music , Latin - American folk songs and other forms
of world music .
At this time Pete became active in the nascent environmental
movement , drawing attention to pollution of the Hudson River with the activist
group Clearwater , which teaches schoolchildren about water pollution .
He and
friends built the Clearwater Sloop , a reproduction of a 19th Century cargo
sloop , and sailed it up and down the river , spreading the word about pollution
and raising public support to clean up the river .
Because of these and other's
efforts , the Hudson is now open for swimming in many places .
One thing that 's endeared him to audiences all over the
world is that he always gets people to join in .
It 's almost a religion with
him .
" The world will be saved when people realize we all have to pitch in .
You
ca n't just pay your money and hope that someone else will do the job right . "
He
continued performing into the 1970s , ' 80s , and '90s , most often at charity
shows and benefits .
Seeger embodies the spirit of this nation more than anyone I
have met .
At 90 , he is humble , straight - backed , clear - eyed , and as
straightforward , sincere , and real as any living folk music icon could be .
He
remains opinionated , articulate , and keenly aware of his place in history and ,
thankfully , has maintained his inimitable sense of hope and optimism .
Pete once
confided to me that he " can go on and on ( talking ) , and frequently I do . "
I
have found my favorite talkaholic can always be counted on for bold ,
provocative , and poignant observations .
I visited him just before his 90th birthday in
the spring of 2009 on a warm afternoon .
The home he shares with his wife , Toshi ,
overlooks the Hudson River and Denny 's Point near Beacon .
I helped him bring
out an umbrella from the barn that we set up in the picnic table on the porch
next to the log cabin he hand built some 50 years ago .
He began discussing the
local history of the region .
Pete is an excellent historian and a wonderful
storyteller .
During the course of our interview , Toshi brought us out a pitcher
of water and contributed to the conversation .
What is it about the
power of a sing along song ?
There is something about participating .
It is almost my religion .
If the world is still here in 100 years , people will know the importance of
participating , not just being spectators .
That 's what this book , Blessed
Unrest , by Paul Hawken is about .
Millions of small groups around the world ,
that do n't necessarily all agree with one another , but they are made up of
people who are not just sitting back waiting for someone to do things for them .
No one can prove anything , but of course if I did n't believe it had some kind
of power , I would n't be trying to do it .
Curiously enough , the people who are suspicious of songs
have put their words down , so they also think there is something to the power
of song .
Plato is supposed to have said it is very dangerous to allow the wrong
kind of music in the Republic .
There is an old Arab story , when the king put the poet on
his payroll ; he cuts off the tongue of the poet .
I know very well that the
powers that be would like to control the music that the people listen to .
Herbert Hoover said to Rudy Vallee , who was a top singer in
1929 : " Mr. Vallee , if you can sing a song that will make the American people
forget the depression , I will give you a medal . "
A lot of musicians would like
to get that kind of medal .
Bing Crosby had a hit record , " Wrap your troubles in
dreams , and dream your troubles away . "
That was how we were going to solve the
depression in 1932 .
I never thought of
those singers as propagandists .
The exception proves the rule .
A lefty named Yip Harburg got
a musician named Jay Gorny to write a tune for him and wrote , " Brother , Can You Spare A Dime ? "
Yip got together in 1938 with Harold Arlen to make songs for the
movie version of The Wizard of Oz. He
said " Harold , get me a melody for the phrase over the rainbow ' . "
Arlen said ,
" there 's no rainbow in the Wizard of Oz .
I have read the script . "
" I 'm putting it in , " said Yip .
When they got this great
melody , the producer tried to cut it from the movie .
It slows up the opening ,
he said .
The two songwriters said , " This movie will not be made unless this
song is in it . "
They went on a two - man strike .
They had hundreds of thousands
of dollars going out every day , extras , scenery , cameraman .
Finally Louis B .
Mayer said , " Oh let the boys have their way , let 's get rolling . "
So they won
the strike .
There is something
magical about people singing together collectively , is n't there ?
I quote John Phillip Sousa frequently .
He asked , " what will
happen to the American Voice now that the phonographic recording has been
invented ? "
Something is irretrievably lost when we are no longer in the
presence of bodies making music .
The nightingale 's song is delightful because
the nightingale gives it forth .
What do you think has
been lost with the advent of all this commercially recorded music that has
altered the folk culture ?
We have a nation of overweight people because our main
exercise is to move from one seat to the other .
From a chair to a car to a desk
to a subway seat to a couch in front of the television , to a chair to eat .
The
danger with the Internet is that you do n't need to think about it , you just
search for it and you find the answer .
Singing used to be part of everyday
life .
Women sang while pounding corn .
Men sang while they were paddling canoes .
When I was in Taipan during World War II , there were some
local islanders who had a stick dance – big sticks , almost a yard long that
would go wack wack as they whirled
around .
I asked one of the men , " When do you do the stick dance ?
At
celebrations or birthday parties ? "
" Oh no , " he said , " before we go into battle ! "
So singing was
part of fighting !
I am told that it was two or three million years ago that
our ancestors started walking on two feet , and that is when they started
swinging clubs and throwing stones to catch an animal , to hit an enemy .
It is
no accident that games like golf and baseball are popular around the world .
It
is in our DNA to like to go whack .
I
like to split wood , it is fun .
What is the most
pronounced thing that you have seen that a song has been able to accomplish ?
The civil rights movement .
Songs did a lot for unions , but
the civil rights movement would not have succeeded if it had n't been for all
those songs .
They were sung in jails and in picket lines and parades .
People
hummed them when they were most beaten .
You have been working
in local schools here in your hometown for quite awhile .
When did you discover
you had a talent for this ?
I was looking for a job as a newspaper man when I was 20 ,
because I had run a school newspaper for six years , at age 12 in one school ,
and age 14 to 17 at another school , and 18 to 19 in college .
I could have led a
very happy life running a small town newspaper , but I did n't even get a hint of
a job .
One editor said to me , " young fellow , you have no experience , I had to
fire somebody last week who had thirty years of experience !
Why should I hire
you ? "
I had an aunt who taught school – my family is full of schoolteachers
– my two brothers , my aunt – who told me she 'd give me five dollars if I 'd come
sing songs for some of her classes .
It seemed like stealing .
This was back in
1939 when most people had to work a full day or two days to earn that much .
Pretty soon I was singing in another school and then
another .
Summertime came and I started singing in summer camps .
I never did go
back to look for a job working at a newspaper .
You can never tell what effect
you have until later on .
I am pleasantly surprised when I meet white haired people
and they tell me they got into my songs when they were in school .
Some people
come up to me and say , " my grandma said that you came to sing for her in
nursery school . "
I 've actually been singing in schools for 70 years .
Was there some aha '
moment when you realized that singing folk songs for kids and other audiences
was to be your life 's work , feeding the flame of the folk music spirit ?
Originally I did n't realize what was going to happen .
Most
people would ask me , do n't you want to make a hit record ?
But I really did n't
like the hypocrisy of the music business .
It was almost an accident when a song
I wrote became a hit .
I did happen to meet in New York Bob Miller who'd come up
from Memphis , Tennessee and had written a song , which was widely popular in the
South around 1922 .
( sings )
Seven cent cotton and forty cent
meat
How in the world can a poor man
eat ?
Flour up high and cotton down low , How in the world can we raise the
dough ?
Clothes worn out , shoes run down , Old slouch hat with a hole in the
crown , Back nearly broken and fingers all
sore , Cotton gone down to rise no more .
He had a hit song in World War II . ( sings )
There 's a Star - Spangled Banner
waving somewhere
In a distant land so many miles
away .
Only Uncle Sam 's great heroes get
to go there Where I wish that I could also live
some day .
I 'd see Lincoln , Custer , Washington
and Perry , And Nathan Hale and Colin Kelly ,
too .
There 's a Star - Spangled Banner
waving somewhere , Waving o'er the land of heroes
brave and true .
In this war with its mad schemes of
destruction
Of our country fair and our sweet
liberty ,
By the mad dictators , leaders of
corruption , Ca n't the U. S. use a mountain boy
like me ?
God gave me the right to be a free
American ,
And for that precious right I 'd
gladly die .
There 's a Star - Spangled Banner
waving somewhere ,
That is where I want to live when I
die .
These were the
exceptions that proved the rule .
I have to say what a genius Irving Berlin was .
I sing his Blue Skies quite often , get audiences
singing it with me .
He could only play the piano in the key of G flat .
In 1919
he happened to meet Mr. Victor Herbert , the composer of operettas .
He said , " Mr. Herbert , you know I do n't
know a thing about music .
I just play the piano by ear and somebody else writes
down my songs .
Do you think I ought to go to music school ? "
Mr. Herbert said ,
" You 've got a good ear for tunes and words .
I think it would cramp your style . "
So he never did .
Berlin did have a special piano built .
He turned a crank and the whole
keyboard would move up and down , so it was a piano capo .
He would play G flat but it would come
out C .
How do you think folk
music serves to influence and mold a culture ?
I think it helps reinforce your sense of history .
An old
song makes you think of times gone by .
Then the idea that you can make up songs
has taken over and I look upon us all as Woody 's children .
There 's a man in the
Bronx – Robert Sherman – at radio station WFUD .
He 's got a weekly program
called Woody's Children — I gave him
the phrase ! — and he plays new songs written by famous and unknown
people .
That show has been running
out for 30 years .
Folk music has proven
to be a useful tool in many social change movements that have succeeded in the
past 60 years .
Does it make you optimistic
about the potential of social change ?
I am more optimistic today than I 've ever been in my entire
long life .
I was so distrustful of the establishment when I was 16 .
I argued
with some other teenagers from a Jewish family – the teenagers were studying
violin – and my mother took me along with her when she was visiting them for a
weekend .
They asked , " What are you going to do with your life ? "
I said , " I 'm going to be a hermit .
This
world is so full of hypocrisy the only way you can be honest is to be a hermit .
I do n't know how I 'm going to meet a living but I 'm going to try . "
I thought I
might be a forest ranger or something like that .
Being out in the woods was my
church .
I had read every book by Ernest Thompson Seton .
Did n't he have a big
influence on you as a young man ?
He boosted the idea of learning about the North American
Indians .
I learned that they
shared everything that they had .
If somebody shot the deer , there were no ice
boxes , so the hunter may have gotten the best cut but everything else was
shared with the rest of the tribe .
There was no such thing as one person in the
tribe going hungry and others having full bellies .
If there was hunger , everybody was hungry .
The chief was
hungry , and his wife and children were hungry .
That seemed to me to be a
sensible way to live .
Now today I know that anthropologists call that tribal communism .
So I say that I was a
Communist ever since I was age seven , when I first started reading about Seton .
So these teenagers , they argued with me and said , " You 're going to be nice and
let the rest of the world go to hell ?
That 's your idea of morality ? "
When you were a
teenager ?
I was about 13 .
I was going to prep school at the time .
I
decided they were right .
They posed their Jewish traditional sense of social
consciousness against my more New England , Thoreau , way of thinking .
I decided
they were right , so I got more involved .
The following year I joined the Harvard student union , and I have been
more involved in one way or another ever since .
Was joining the
Harvard student union pivotal for you ?
I was a sophomore in the second year there .
My first year
there I tried to keep my independence , but some friends criticized me saying , you
mean you 're at Harvard and you 're not a member of the Harvard student union ? '
So I went back and joined and pretty soon I was the secretary of the club .
Then
we decided to run a monthly magazine – all of four pages .
The Harvard Progressive .
I got so interested in putting it out , I
allowed my grades to slip and then I lost my scholarship .
I had a part - time scholarship when it cost all of $ 1,200 to
go to Harvard in those days for one year .
My brothers paid some money and I
worked and raised about $ 300 , and I had a scholarship for $ 300 .
When I lost my
scholarship and my brothers could not give me anymore ….
I was n't sorry to leave ,
as I 'd found that professors could be as selfish as anybody else .
What do you recall ?
I remember our sociology Professor Pitirim A. Sorokin .
He was a friend of the guy who
used to run the Soviet government just before the revolution , Alexander
Kerensky .
Mr. Sorokin said do n't
think you can change the world .
The world is going to change as it wants to , no
matter what your little individual efforts do what you can do is study the
world .
I thought that was very foolish .
He was trying to persuade people not to
be activists just to be scholars and study the world .
( Toshi came outside with a pitcher of water for us )
To what extent has
your been a collaborative effort ?
Toshi Seeger : He
is very determined and he takes his own time and does what he wants to do .
Pete Seeger : A
whole batch of things would n't have happened were it not for Toshi .
We have
never found another person to run the Clearwater Revival like she ran it .
Toshi Seeger : You
do what you want to do
Pete Seeger : More
or less
Toshi Seeger : He
would just like to do more things
Is it seemed like a
lot of folk songs have really simple chord structures .
Why is it some of the
simplest songs are the most moving and evocative ?
Some very simple melodies have never been forgotten through
history .
The tune used for " Twinkle Twinkle Little Star " is known in every
country in Europe in many different forms ( sings
five verses in five languages ) .
Those are just a few examples from five
places … Norway , the national anthem of Israel in Hebrew …  Come by Here ' is a
Gospel song .
Who knows ?
It could have been somebody in a cave dancing around bud dom bud dom bud dom bud dom bud dom bud
dom bud dom bud dom .
Maybe they are just easy to remember , so simple yet so
memorable .
How do you balance
your inspiration to write new songs with your quest to sing and nurture old
traditional folk songs ?
Sometimes you find an old tune so good you can use it
several times for different purposes .
Richard Farina used an old English melody
that I used for a song against the Vietnam War . ( hums a melody )
What role did your
musicologist dad play in your career choice ?
A very big influence .
At ages eight , nine and ten , we'd go
off on long hikes together and talk as we were walking along .
When I was
younger I loved his nutty stories that he made up off the top of his head .
He'd
say , " What if that tree over there had ears , and said  I heard that man say he
would like to chop me down .
Why could n't I grow smaller ? '
And the tree prays to
the lord and says , please let me grow smaller . '
For some reason that tree
does n't seem to be as tall as it used to be . "
He was a brilliant scholar and writer , though he only put
out one book , a collection of papers that he produced for the Society of
Musicologists .
The last chapter in the book was on the non-folkness of the folk
and the folkness of the folk .
The last paragraph :
Thus we may see that
musically speaking , the population of the United States may be divided up into
two classes .
This was a joke about Marxists .
One that does know it is a folk
and the other does not think that it is a folk .
But they are both folk of one
sort of another .
I remember at age nine he told me that a rich person could
live cheaper then a poor person .
" What do you mean ? " I asked him .
" Well , take
rent for example .
The average person pays rent all of his life , but if you can
get far enough ahead of the game and can buy a place , taxes will never be as
much as rent is . "
Which is one of the reasons I found this 17 1/2 acres for
$ 1,750 .
It was so steep that people would look at it from below and say it was
too steep to build on .
But I climbed up the little cliff and saw it leveled off
for a half an acre and went back and told Toshi I found a place that we could
afford .
My father was the one who started me thinking about
radicals .
In 1929 , like a lot of people , he thought the crash was the end of
the free enterprise system .
He started a group called the Composers Collective .
Aaron Copeland was a member and Marc
Blitzstein and half a dozen others .
They were trying to think of what kind of
music this new social situation demanded .
However , their efforts were almost
laughably failures .
They went in for dissident , counterpoint Schoenberg ,
Stravinsky , and so on .
The working people were quite uninterested in learning
their songs .
My father brought Aunt Molly around to the Composers Collective , and they listened
to her and said , " but Charlie , this is all music from the past , we are supposed
to be composing music for the future . "
He took Molly back to her apartment on
the Lower East Side and he said , " Molly I am sorry they did not understand you
but I know some young people who are going to want to learn your songs . "
And I
was one of them !
( sings ) I am a union woman , as brave as I can be ,
I do not like the bosses and the
bosses do n't like me .
How have you seen the
community of Beacon change over the years having lived here for 60 years ?
It was a very conservative little factory town .
Then about
28 years ago , there was a race riot in the high school and a man came up from
New York City to help advise the city on how to cool it , and he said " you have
a nice main street , have you ever thought of having some kind of a block party
here ? "
Some women decided to do the job , calling it  The Spirit of Beacon Day , '
and it is the last Sunday of September every year .
It starts with a parade that
at first lasted just a few minutes .
Last year the parade went on for an hour !
Everybody wants to be in the parade .
Last year there were 10,000 people in the
parade , and there are only 14,000 people in the town !
If we turned back
time , what would your older self advise your younger self ?
Do n't join the Communist Party .
Be friendly , but advise them
that they are going to be in trouble if they do n't talk about and make
decisions as a group .
Do n't just take the orders from above .
I think it was
Lenin 's basic mistake .
Lenin said we lost the revolution of 1905 because we are not
disciplined and that if we are disciplined like an army , we will win the next
revolution .
It 's true , they took power , but if it had n't been Stalin , somebody
else would have done it .
If you do n't have freedom of the press , freedom to
meet and talk and argue , sooner or later you will be in big trouble .
They would n't have agreed with me .
They 'd have said , " You
are either with us or against us .
Does that man Woody Guthrie agree with you ? "
I would say , " No , he is in the hospital … "
They would have argued with Woody too
if they 'd had the chance .
I would have argued with them , but then they did some
wonderful things .
After all , they saved the lives of the Scottsboro Boys .
They
helped Paul Robeson .
If I 'd known then what I know now , I would have worked to
see that someone like Dr. King came along .
He really turned my thinking around .
How did Dr. King turn
your thinking around ?
When you face an opponent over a broad front , you do n't aim
at your opponent 's strong points .
People say , why did he waste time trying to
get a seat on the bus , why did n't he spend time working for jobs or education
or housing or voting .
Those are things worth fighting for .
He took on the view that you do n't aim for your opponent's
strong points , you take on something to the side .
You win it , you capture it ,
and then you go on to something else .
They made some mistakes in Albany ,
Georgia , and when they went to Birmingham , they did not repeat them .
He'd get one group to talk and the other to ask questions
and then the others would talk and the first ones would ask questions , and
after two or three days they would finally reach an agreement on what they were
going to do .
Because he said " if we do n't work together we are not going to
succeed - but if we do work together , we can win this . "
In Albany , they tried to fight the business men as well as
the police .
But in Birmingham , they split the police from the businessmen .
A
lot of businessmen said , " Hey we are losing a lot of money here … " Bull Connor
ran the city , and he was so stupid as to sick the dogs on the black kids .
When
that was on television news , people said , " We did n't know things like this
would happen in America . "
They had n't realized how brutal Jim Crow could be .
When you saw a lynching , you probably realized how brutal Jim Crow could be .
Did you know there were 6,000 lynchings between 1890 and
1920 ?
Interesting that 1,000 were white people , like the Jew who was head of a
small company in Atlanta .
A girl had been raped and folks said , " oh it was the
boss who raped her , " and he was lynched .
That was a famous case around WWI .
You once said you
were a Communist like the average Indian would be and your view on Communism
involved nothing that would n't fit in the constitution .
In today 's North
America , what does being a Communist mean to you ?
After I dropped out of college in 1938 , I joined an artist
group , part of the Youth Communist League making posters .
I drifted out of the
Communist Party in the early 1950s .
When I was handing out flowers at this past
Memorial Day someone asked me " Seeger are you a Communist ? " and I said " it
depends of the description . "
I became one at age seven and in a sense I still
am one .
I would like to see a world with no millionaires .
Communism means different things to different people .
Some
communists hate our government and want our government to be like what it was
under Stalin .
On the other hand , an anthropologist will refer to tribal
communism .
An ex-Trotskyist will say Trotsky would have done it right whereas
Stalin did it wrong .
I am not sure that he would have been able to because he
was still relying on guns .
He was n't into
non-violence .
Did I ever recite you the poem written by Lee Hayes , called ,
" To Know Good Will ? "
He only had a
few months to live .
He had diabetes and died in his 60's .
I visited him and
this poem was on his piano .
Maybe he was trying to think of a tune for it .
I tried to think of a tune but
could n't .
But I said , " Lee , could I have a copy of this poem ? " and he said ,
" Oh , take it . "
Lee had a large
sense of self - criticism .
He tore up all books that he had written .
He felt they
were no good .
Here is his poem :
If I should one day die by
violence , please take this as my written will .
And in the name of simple ,
common sense , treat my destroyer only as one ill , as one who needed more than I
could give , as one who never really learned to live in peace and joy and love
of life , but was diseased and plagued by hate and strife .
My vanished life
might have some meaning still when my destroyer learns to know good will .
He wrote plays , wrote short stories , novels and even
humorous detective stories for the Ellery Queen magazine .
Do you think protest
music has changed since the 60's ?
I do n't know enough because I do n't listen to records , but
my guess is that there are many , many different kinds now , some slow and
serious .
Some are loud and shouting , or satirical .
It seems key to
successful folk songs , it helps when they bounce in your mind repeatedly .
On the other hand , one of the most famous songs in the world
– written 400 years ago – you do n't call it a folk song , but it is .
It was written by a man in Ireland .
He
was a blind harper named Rory Dall O'Cahan .
In the 17th century , 400 years ago ,
up in North Ireland a whole batch of his cousins were slaughtered when
Castlecary fell to the English and he wrote a tune in memory of them .
For 300 years it was known as O'Cahan 's Lament – a famous tune that
people will occasionally try to put words to it but it was discouraged .
It has
all the meaning you want :
Do n't forget ,
do n't forget , do n't forget .
An English composer in our country , O'Cahan's
Lament …
And then in the 1890's , a woman in London put out a book , Irish Traditional Airs .
And now she gave
it a name , The Londonderry Air .
And an English lawyer put the words of Oh Danny Boy to it , which is now known
around the world , not just in Ireland .
A very long melody .
No repetition in it
except a kind of an echo .
The musical phrases relate to each other .
It is
called an inner design .
( Sings ) Oh
Danny boy … and rhythmic .
Sing it quite slowly .
It is a minute and 15 seconds
long and not many tunes are that long .
Most are 15 - 20 seconds long .
Skip to Ma Loo is only 20 seconds .
What was it like
playing up on the Lincoln Memorial on the Washington Mall for the Obama
inauguration ?
These big things , I tend to be against them , but Bruce
Springsteen is such a very nice guy .
He is very honest and he says we have
arranged everything and you do n't need to think about anything except singing
one song and they let me sing the verses which had been cut out of the school
song books .
In the squares of the city , in the
shadow of a steeple ,
By the relief office , I 'd seen my
people .
As they stood there hungry , I stood
there wishing , Is this land made for you and me .
There was a big high wall there
that tried to stop me .
The sign was painted , it said
private property .
But on the back side it did n't say
nothing .
That side was made for you and me .
Nobody living can ever stop me , As I go walking that freedom
highway .
Nobody living can ever make me turn
back
This land was made for you and me .
Why was singing these
verses so important to you ?
These were the original verses which Woody had written .
He
sang them several different ways .
He sang them sometimes , no trespassing is the
sign .
That is the way his son Arlo
does it .
The way I learned it is
how he wrote it , mentioning private property .
He rhymed  stop me ' with  private property . '
Then the last verse I sang he wrote
afterwards , but he taught this to Arlo .
Arlo was about seven , and Woody had gotten out of the hospital
on the weekend to visit his family .
He said , " Arlo , they are singing my song ,
but they left out three of the best verses . ' "
Woody sang those and taught Arlo , " Nobody living can ever
stop me . "
Down there in Washington I did not have to think about food or
transportation or anything else , I just had to memorize those six verses .
What impressed you
about that event ?
What I recall is the freezing dress rehearsal the day
before .
It was January 17th at 7:30 pm at night .
My hands were frozen and we
sang that song three times through for every cameraman to know exactly where and
when they were to aim the cameras and every microphone person to know where to
take the microphone when and where .
I was amazed at how well it was organized .
You mentioned you
have reassessed Abraham Lincoln 's administration , why ?
I did not realize what a job he had to do .
I read this book
about Lincoln and the team of rivals he put together .
The men of his cabinet
really disapproved of each other .
One was more against slavery and the other
would be quite willing to go along with slavery .
Lincoln tried to keep the
whole coalition together .
The Republican party was a coalition of dissatisfied
Democrats and some abolitionists , some people who were not involved in slavery
at all .
Lincoln pulled together this coalition and then three years
into the war they started bringing in the black troops .
I did n't know how
horrible the draft riots were , the Irish did n't want to be drafted .
If when you
came over here , you had $ 300 , you pay that and you did n't have to be drafted .
In
other words rich people did n't get drafted .
The Irish blame that on the
Africans and have a whole batch lynched in New York City .
This went on for
several weeks and then finally Lincoln found a way to cool them down , to end
the draft riots , which was to bring the Republican coalition together .
They were all ambitious people .
At least three of them
thought they should be president and if they did not win the nomination on the
first ballot , they would win it on the second and Lincoln purposely kept
himself in the background .
He did not run against it on the first and he did
not run against it on the second ballot .
But on the 3rd ballot , he all of a sudden came forward and all sorts of
people said , " Well this is a good compromise . "
Chase makes enemies and Seward made some enemies and Bates
had made some enemies but Lincoln would say a word here and a word there and he
was able to pull together that coalition that would win an election .
Some of
them were dissatisfied Democrats and some of them were former WICs , who became
Republicans who were not really against slavery , but some up in New England ,
all against slavery and Chase , out in Ohio , was very much against segregation .
He made some enemies , even in Ohio .
The Emancipation Proclamation had been on his desk for
months and people were wondering , " Is he ever going to sign it ? "
He finally figured out the exact
wording and the exact right time , but even he was surprised with the enthusiasm when he finally signed it .
He got much stronger support than anybody had
believed .
Even he was surprised how enthusiastic people were once he had signed
it .
That is of course when black
troops sang " When John Brown 's body lies a -mouldering in the grave . "
And
Harriet Beecher Stowe was leaning out the window listening to this great
melody .
Curiously , the melody was written by a preacher in Georgia . ( sings )
But John Brown 's Body and Beecher
Stowe 's got the enthusiasm and it is still sung .
( sings
slowly )
The beauty of the lily 's crushed across the sea …
Do you have any
method for plugging into your muse for the songwriting ?
No .
Sometimes
when you most want to write a song , you can't think of a thing .
On the other
hand , I wrote that song , that funny little song about if you can't be reduced , because
I had a cold for four days and I could not speak to anybody .
I had a bad sore
throat and my feet were up in the air for four days and I put the words on the
wall .
I stuck them with a thumbtack to the wall – three feet from the right of
my head – and by gosh , at the end of four days , I had a song and have sung it
for a wide variety of audiences now .
( sings )
Ca n't be reduced , reused , repaired … refurbish , refinish , resold , recycled or
composted …
Same chords over and over .
From a D chord to a D chord to a
D chord .
Then G chord to a C chord to a D chord .
Repeated .
You have had a long
time love affair and relationship with this Hudson River .
Can
you tell me about your first encounter and what inspired your long time
commitment ?
I was learning how to sail .
A teenager taught me how to sail
when I had a job on Cape Cod at midnight .
He took me out in a little ten foot
boat and showed me the aim is not how fast you go but that you sail at
all .
It is a game with the wind
and the waves .
And the wind can be coming .
Well in this case , it is coming ,
more or less North now – trying to blow me south , but if I use the sails right ,
I can go northwest .
I can go northeast , northwest and the very power of the
wind – I can sail right into it .
And that is life too .
Dr. King would zig and zag and land in jail but
more contributions would come in .
You use this as a
metaphor for social movements , but what of your boat ride ?
I was trying to learn to sail .
We got a little plastic boat  went out and bought myself one  and Toshi says , " You sure you are safe all
by yourself ? " I said I would stay
out of the main current so I would n't get hit .
I will stay near the shore but I
forgot to pull up the centerboard when I anchored to go to sleep for a while
and I woke up because the centerboard had hit the bottom and it was just hooked
on .
I had to swim under the boat and lift the centerboard up and stick it in
the slot again and hook it up .
But when I went to sleep , the sun turned slowly from yellow
to orange to red to purple to midnight black and I wrote a song :
( sings )
Sailing down this golden river …sun and water all my own . "
But then I saw lumps of this and that and toilet paper
floating by and thought of James Gailbraith 's great phrase , " private affluence ,
public squalor . "
I had enough
money to buy this boat but I was sailing through shit .
That is when a friend of
mine said , " Pete , they used to have sailboat sloops on the Hudson River 70 feet
long . "
I said , oh do n't give me that .
He loaned me a the book written by a man
named Beacon a little more than 100 years ago .
I think it was 1907 and in it
were the most beautiful boats we 've had and they will never be seen again .
Steam had taken over the river business and railroads had taken the passengers .
That is when I stayed up until 2 o'clock in the morning writing a seven - page ,
single paged letter , saying if we can find those that have that kind of money
and get the government and people together , we can build a replica of one of
these boats .
Not a half size replica , a full size replica .
That was the most
important decision , that it be a full size and just the mere size of it holds
50 kids on board !
You once told me that
it is your proudest accomplishment .
Well it is just one .
It is the exception .
My head , my life
is full of grand ideas which never have worked out .
Rather than dwell on
that , let 's look at the ones that did work out for you .
Clearwater worked out .
I liked your idea to
construct a swimming structure in the Hudson River .
I met a woman in New York who had the same idea .
She came up here and designed one and
now we have one , what we call a river pool .
You helped to
catalyze that ?
And the river pool has been around for several years now ?
No , only actually one year .
Last year it was in the river
for two months , and worked out .
About 1000 kids swam in it .
It has netting
underneath it and on the sides , keeping anyone from escaping and getting
drowned , and it goes up and down with the tide .
Our hope now is to build a big
river pool so someone can swim 75 foot laps .
It celebrates the fact that the
river is now swimable .
It was not very swimable 40 years ago .
Now the Clearwater
campaign is 40 years old and the river is much cleaner .
But the problem is , us land lovers made some mistakes .
Forty years ago , the board of directors
told the captain , " those people are calling us dirty hippies .
Wash that deck ten
times a day if necessary .
Keep it clean , clean , clean . "
And down in New York
City , they swabbed it with salt water .
Up north they swabbed it with fresh
water .
Salt water pickles wood and fresh water rots it .
Some leaked through the
deck and caused rot below .
Five years after the boat was built , we had to spend $ 80,000
to tear the bow out .
We tore the stern out too .
Replaced some beams under the
deck .
Some rot was started way , way down near the keel , but it was n't bad
enough 35 years to go to our tearing the boat apart but now , 35 years later ,
the boat has to be torn apart all the way down to the keel and repaired or the
boat will rot away ; wo n't be able to sail anymore .
Now have to raise millions .
Everything is going up – how much has inflation gone up in 40 years ?
The thought then was $ 100,000 .
It
might be a million dollars now .
It seems like the
past 40 years have sort of been , as my friend John Perry Barlow has said , a war
between the 1950's and the 1960's .
Do you think there is some truth there ?
I call them the frightened 50's and the scintillating 60's .
After the 60's were over , I think one of the mistakes of the 60's , and I told
the young people this , was you think you can have a revolution with just young
people ?
You need to have all ages .
I failed to get either Jerry Rubin or Abbie Hoffman to agree with me .
They
wanted me to come out to Chicago in 1968 .
They said " You 're the only older
person we want to have out there . "
I asked , " Why do n't you want to have older people out there ? "
And they
said , " Well we are going to carry this through ourselves . "
I think they
were wrong .
I think that is one of the lessons .
We now use all ages .
Teenagers
working with grandparents working with kids ten years old .
There was n't a lot of publicity , people
thought , " Oh there is nothing happening in the 70's , " but the women 's movement
took over and this may be , in the long run , the most important one .
I think
worldwide , the woman 's movement is the one we should expect saves the world .
Why do they hate those people so .
They are our distant
cousins .
They love their babies just like we love our babies .
It is true ; they
got killers among them , just like we have killers amongst us .
They got
drunkards among them just like we got drunkards amongst us .
We got insane
people as well as they do .
My older brother says at 11 years old , he can cure a
bully .
I have to get together with him and find out how you cure a bully .
I
think it is by giving them experiences and he sees how people really like him
when he does something nice and does something generous ; they may be scared of
him but he does something powerful .
They help me , they make me feel good .
They
admire me and I do something generous .
Now , could scientists find out how to
identify a bully ?
And cure them when
they are only 3 - 4 years old ?
I think probably , he will be much more particular
about beating kids .
If you treat
your kid so that force is the only thing … " you do n't listen to me , so I 'll show
you !
Whack ! "
I once lied to my father when I was five years old and he
got down on his knees and said , " Remember Peter , we love you .
It is perfectly
okay if you spent that money on candy .
We love you .
You do n't ever have to lie
to us . "
Speaking of your
father , when he was 90 , he said to you something that really stuck out in your
mind about scientists and their view that ….
Scientists think that an infinite increase in empirical
information is a good thing .
Can they prove it ?
Of course they cannot .
It is a religious belief .
Something
they feel must be true .
They can't prove that it is true .
How do you assess his
statement now 50 years later ?
Right after that he turned to me with his wry smile and said ,
" Of course , if I 'm right Pete , perhaps the committee that told Galileo to shut
up is correct . "
All you can do is laugh .
Hegel says there was always thesis .
There
was always anti-thesis and there is always synthesis , and the synthesis is in the
song , " Turn , Turn , Turn . "
Now I talk with deeply religious people whenever I have a
chance and say to them , " When you come to a curve , do you look up into the sky
and say ,  God , it is dangerous crossing the streets , will you please see to it
that I do n't get hit ? ' "
No !
You look to the left ; you look to the right and if
there is no car coming , you cross .
Use the brains God gave you .
If we use the
brains
God gave us , there will still be a human race here after years , but if
all we do is say , God will you please save the human race ?
Wo n't you please send me to
heaven ?
And this world comes to
hell .
Prayers alone are not
going to do it .
That is why I quote Alfred North Whitehead , whose famous
essay , " Aims of Education , " says all education should be religious .
My father
thought he was talking about science .
Religious education in both cases , duty
and reverence .
That is a good definition .
All religion has duty and
reference .
Here is his definition :
duty arises because of a potential control over the course of events and the
source of reverence lies in this perception that the present holds within
itself the complete sum of existence , forwards and backwards and great amplitude
of time , which is eternity .
When I clap my hands that is because of cause and
effect for all eternity and it disturbs molecules which disturbs other
molecules and which disturbs other molecules for all eternity .
Human self is the complete sum of
existence .
That is profound
Pete .
You can help determine this by a sense of duty .
I try to sing the songs that people
will take to heart , maybe want to sing later on themselves .
I am absolutely
delighted .
You know the songs by the kids in school .
They like this song , which
I felt was just kind of a private personal song : the Darkness before the Dawn .
You know the song ?
You know it is darkest before the dawn .
( sings ) Trying to cheer myself up .
Have you been
heartened by this new wave of environmentalism ?
Yes !
And I heard just today that that Obama has appointed
Van Jones to some job in Washington .
Yes .
As of last month .
He is now working for the Obama 's Council of Environmental Quality as an
advisor for Green Jobs , Enterprise and Innovation .
You have become a big fan of
Van Jones and his Green Job 's campaign .
Do you think his notions are the best
vehicle to get us towards a peace - time economy beyond war ?
Wonderful things .
I mistrust the word THE .
The answer .
The solution .
The Savior .
The End .
The beginning .
Do you find him
pretty inspiring ?
I recommend his book to everybody .
Especially young people .
I am hoping to get the chance to speak to the high school kids here and tell
them , " You are always being asked questions by grownups .
Why do n't you act
better ?
Why do n't you do this and that ? "
I think that teenagers should think
about questions to ask grownups .
Why is it that you do certain things ?
Why do grownups think they know all the
answers ?
And I think they would find out they do n't all think they know that .
Many of them are deeply insecure and probably taking it out on you because you
are helpless .
You have really
invested a lot of time with young people .
You must get a lot back from seeing all of their positive
reactions .
Many of the themes in
your songs talk about civic involvement and activism and because you yourself
have been out being an activist , it comes easy for you to convey that to
others .
This is a poem the Nobel Prize winner Seamus Heaney of
Ireland wrote :
When I landed in the republic of conscience .
it
was so noiseless when the engines stopped
I
could hear a curlew high above the runway
At
immigration , the clerk was an old man
who produced a wallet from his homespun coat
and showed me a photograph of my grandfather
The woman in customs asked me to declare
the words of our traditional cures and charms
to
heal dumbness and avert the evil eye
No
porters .
No interpreter .
No taxi .
You carried your own burden and very soon
your symptoms of creeping privilege disappeared Fog is a dreaded omen there , but lightning
spells universal good and parents hang
swaddled infants in trees during thunder storms
Salt is their precious mineral .
And seashells
are held to the ear during births and funerals .
The base of all inks and pigments is seawater
Their sacred symbol is a stylized boat
The sail is an ear , the mast a sloping pen ,
The hull a mouth - shape , the keel an open eye .
At
their inauguration , public leaders
must swear to uphold unwritten law and weep
to
atone for their presumption to hold office
and to affirm their faith that all life sprang
from salt in tears which the sky - god wept
after he dreamt his solitude was endless
I
came back from that frugal republic
with my two arms the one length , the customs woman
having insisted my allowance was myself
The old man rose and gazed into my face
and said that was official recognition
that I was now a dual citizen
He
therefore desired me when I got home
to
consider myself a representative
and to speak on their behalf in my own tongue
Their embassies , he said , were everywhere
but operated independently
and no ambassador would ever be relieved
It is a great poem , a truly great poem .
How have you seen the
content of popular commercial songs change ?
During the 1930's , the Establishment had music quite under
its control .
Hit songs came out of
Broadway or Hollywood .
A few
people down South listened to what they called the Hillbilly and the Race
catalogues of the record companies .
And the Race catalogues were either gospel or
the blues .
Jimmy Rogers and the Singing Brakemen , who yodeled , that was the
Hillbilly catalogue .
Bluegrass did n't come in until the 1950's .
Bluegrass and rock and roll and Motown
all came in , and the songs that everybody listens to have really been out of
control since then .
Up until then they were pretty much under control by the
Establishment , including the songs that the kids learned in school .
" This Land is Your Land " became popular after Woody recorded
it for a tiny label called Folkways , maybe 1,000 copies sold , but music
teachers in New York liked it so much they got the kids in New York singing it ,
and then a textbook publisher who was putting out a new book of songs thought ,
well , kids like this song , we 'll put it in .
The song was never sold in any
music store , it was never played on the radio , it was never played on TV .
But
15 or 20 years later , everybody in America knew it because the kids brought the
song home with them .
I am sure since then the Establishment has been much more
careful about what songs are put in school songbooks .
Now I hear they are
trying to get rid of music in schools .
But there are now not dozens but
hundreds of people going into schools with guitars , musicians who just like to
sing for kids .
Even though there is no money in it .
There is even an organization called Guitar Pickers in the
Schoolroom .
What is your sense of
the evolution of Hillbilly music into Country music ?
Country music was called hillbilly music back 80 years ago .
They
had what was the Hillbilly catalogue for Victor and other companies .
The race
catalogue was for blues and gospel music .
But they found that down South , they
were n't buying the music made in New York , so they put a machine and set it up
in a hotel room and he would advertise , " pay $ 25 for anything I accept " and
next morning there would be a line of people in the hotel hallway and maybe
nine out of ten – " sorry , ca n't use your song " – or one would be good , and
they 'd take it and that is how Mississippi John Hurt was recorded and Doc Bogs
and a whole batch of people .
Back in the 20s , Ralph Peters was one of the people .
Not
everybody in America likes to buy records of New York music , but they had
gotten music down there that they liked and that they will buy .
Then the people
in Nashville decided they could record it too and Nashville declared its
independence and then Motown declared its independence .
Now of course , there are independent
people everywhere .
Such that music
stores are closing down and record stores are closing down all over the country
just like bookstores are closing down all around the country .
What is your take
about the future of the music industry ?
Nobody knows .
I
hope that it does n't become completely chaotic .
What is the Campaign
for Public Domain Reform ?
When somebody puts new words to an old tune , it might be a
1000 - year old tune from some little country somewhere in the world like I did
with Abiyoyo .
I think some of the copyrighted money should go to the place
and the people where the original tune came from .
In order to see that it
works , I have proposed that every country in the world , all the United Nations
and the other countries have what we call a public domain committee of people
who know music and you would n't bother them with any song that gets written
with 10,000 songs that are written every week , but if a song starts earning
some money , it comes to their attention and they should distribute some of the
money .
Might be one percent , might be 50 percent , might be more .
That money
could go to that country and people .
Even the USA could have a public domain committee .
In the case of Abiyoyo , I rewrote the contract with the
publisher to send 50 percent of the royalties to the part of South Africa where
that melody came from .
It is from the Xhosa people of Port Elizabeth .
Nelson
Mandela is a Xhosa .
They have several dozen kinds of clicks in their language .
Miriam Makeba just sang one click song , Uqongqothwane .
It means beetle , a dung beetle .
Some dung in the road .
She could click so loud
you could hear it 100 yards away .
Abiyoyo
is a Xhosa lullaby .
In New York , a
nice little organization called WooBooToo started .
WooBooToo means shares in
the Xhosa language and they raise money for scholarships and libraries in Port
Elizabeth or in the region where Xhosa live all around there .
The Xhosa claim that they originated way in northeast Africa ,
but at the same time , people started going around and getting crowded up there .
They went down the eastern coast of Africa to the very southern corner , oh 1,000
years ago or so .
I had one meeting and we had 70 people discussing the idea for
campaign for public domain reform and some were managers of performers , some
were songwriters , some were publishers and all they were all interested , but
could not find any agreement on what to do .
I sent a description of the idea to the Whitehall office ,
the Geneva Switzerland office for the World Committee for Intellectual Property
and they keep up with the different copyright rules in different nations .
They
think copyright should go on down through the family forever , so this family is
still trying to collect on some Italian composer of 400 years ago .
In the beginning , when the copyright laws first passed , I
think things passed into public domain in about ten years and Thomas Jefferson
said that is long enough to profit from it , from writing a book or something
and then it should be public domain .
Later , in the 19th century they gradually lengthened it and when I was
young , it used to be 25 years , I think .
Recently , the Disney company got it
increased because Mickey Mouse was going to be public domain and so it is now
at 75 years .
To what do your
credit your long and successful union with Toshi ?
Her patience with me .
She is really the secret of the
family .
I have had this lifelong problem of starting projects which I do n't
find time to finish .
Sometimes projects work out so well that other people
carry them on .
That 's what happened with Clearwater .
Toshi describes you
as stubborn .
But of course , she
has her own biased perspective , having lived with you for 64 years .
How would you describe Pete Seeger in
brief ?
A compromiser .
I compromised all my life in one way or
another .
In your creative
life , how have you compromised ?
I borrow here and borrow there , sometimes giving credit and
sometimes forgetting to give it .
Woody Guthrie and Lee Hays were the two
geniuses I knew .
And Toshi the
third .
Are they really
golden years ?
Right now no , this is the most difficult time either of us ,
Toshi or I have ever had .
The phone ringing every few minutes , " Wo n't you come
down and sing to us ?
Wo n't you come and accept an award ?
Wo n't you say a few
words about my book ?
Wo n't you say a few words about my CD ? "
I was protected from this for most of my life by my " left "
reputation , but now I have blown my cover .
You are at a certain
crest in your life .
I am worth money .
I think it is the
spirit that you 've embraced that people value more than the money .
So many of
the causes and issues you have helped champion celebrate their successes in
part because of the efforts of you and your folk singing colleagues .
I look upon myself as a link in the chain .
I learned from
Woody Guthrie just like he learned from others .
I have been a sower of seeds .
I
have written a lot of songs about that .
I am sure a lot of teachers have seen
themselves as sowers of seeds .
Jesus says in all the gospels besides John , the story of the
parable of the sower , slightly different words , but it is basically the same .
Some seeds fall on stones , do n't even sprout , but some seeds fall on fallow
ground and multiply one hundred fold .

A month ago , Raw Story reported that Maywood , California was about to lay off all its city employees , following “ years of financial abuse and corruption ” by its city council , and outsource most municipal services to the neighboring town of Bell .
But it appears that Bell is no shining example of fiscal management either .
During a closed meeting late Thursday night , the city manager , assistant city manager , and police chief all resigned , following a public outcry over their combined annual salaries of $ 1.6 million .
Many residents would like to see most members of the city council resign , as well .

California Attorney General Jerry Brown issued a statement saying , “ These outrageous salaries in Bell are shocking and beyond belief . ”
Bell , like Maywood , is a small and poverty - stricken suburb of Los Angeles , with a heavily Hispanic population of just 37,000 residents .
The Los Angeles Times reports , “ The emergency meeting followed several days of negotiations between the officials and attorneys for the city to reach deals .
The crowd began shouting when Councilman Lorenzo Velez ’s request to open the meeting to the public was overruled by the city attorney , who said the city would be at legal risk if it discussed personnel matters in public .
Emotions ran so high that the council chamber was briefly cleared . ”
Local residents then waited outside from 4:30 until midnight to learn the results of the meeting .
“ The crowd erupted in applause after the announcement but immediately yelled out questions about what would happen to the council members .
Four of the five are paid close to $ 100,000 annually .
When their questions were not answered , they shouted , ‘ Recall ! ' ”
A few hours later , the Bell Association to Stop the Abuse — whose acronym , BASTA , is Spanish for “ enough ” — called upon Mayor Oscar Hernandez and all but one of the city council members to step down .
Council member Lorenzo Velez , who was appointed and not elected , earns only $ 8,076 , and BASTA spokesman Ali Saleh said , “ We support his staying if he ’s willing to help us fight the corruption . ”
Mayor Hernandez , however , charged the Los Angeles Times — which set off the confrontation when it revealed last week that Bell officials were paid “ some of the highest municipal wages in the country ” — with having a “ skewed view of the facts . ”

Hernandez pointed proudly to Bell ’s “ clean streets , refurbished parks and numerous programs for people of all ages ” and said that over the last 17 years , Chief Administrative Officer Robert Rizzo had turned the city around from being $ 13 million in debt to having a budget surplus of $ 22.7 million .
In September 2005 , California passed a law limiting the pay of city council members in small towns like Bell to about $ 400 a month , or slightly more if they also serve on city commissions .
Two months later , Bell held “ a little - noticed special election that attracted fewer than 400 voters ” and declared itself a charter city , making it eligible to bypass the law .
Rizzo ’s current salary is $ 787,637 a year , and the Times notes that he owns a “ sprawling horse ranch .. valued at more than $ 1 million ” and was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving this past March after he crashed into a neighbor ’s mailbox .
When he steps down at the end of August , he will be entitled to a state pension of over $ 650,000 a year for life , making him the highest - paid retiree in the state system .

Police Chief Randy Adams makes $ 457,000 a year — 50 % more than the police chief of Los Angeles — and could receive an annual pension of $ 411,000 .
Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia , who currently earns $ 376,288 , could receive $ 250,000 a year when she reaches the age of 55 .
The Los Angeles County district attorney ’s office is now looking into whether any state laws have been violated .
Attorney General Jerry Brown — who is currently the Democratic candidate for governor — is also investigating , as is the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System ( Calpers ) , which would be responsible for the pension payments .

Where bodies of water can divide us , Maggie will make rain
by Jeremy Hooper
To understand the true stakes of the gay rights debate , one need look no further than the following CNN piece .
At its heart is a binational same - sex couple who cannot marry under federal law , and who are therefore unable to adequately protect their bond in order to stay together .
Then to the far - right of the notion of heart is professional anti-equality proponent Maggie Gallagher , making it sound as if gay couples are just any other pair of pals , all while disingenuously overlooking the undeniable role that her own daily work of denying marriage rights to same - sex couples has in all of this .
The debate is not a two - sided , equal footing , " agree to disagree " situation .
It is a deservedly unequal fight between peace and cruel injustice :
[ SCENE ]
MAGGIE : [ dials seven digits in her phone , waits for answer on other end ]
MAGGIE'S MOM : Maggie ?
Hello , dear !
MAGGIE : Hi , ma .
Just want to let you know that I 'm on CNN today .
You should try to check it out .
MOM : Oh that 's great dear !
Talking about the oil spill ?
MAGGIE : Uhm , no .
MOM : Economy ?
MAGGIE : No .
MOM : Climate change ?
The obesity epidemic ?
Ending war ?
MAGGIE : Nope , nada , no way .
MOM : Then what , dear ?
MAGGIE : Well , I went on the national airwaves for the sole purpose of justifying tearful airport embraces between certain tax - paying citizens .
MOM : What 's that , dear ?
MAGGIE : I 'm on TV to keep loving couples apart .
You know those gay couples that I 've been talking about incessantly for the past decade and change ?
And you know how I do n't want them to marry under civil law ?
Well here 's the thing : I also do n't want them to even be together in any easy , benign way .
So even though there are millions of gay people living and working and playing and contributing to society ...
MOM : Right , there are lots of them in the theater .
[ thinks for a minute ]
Wait , do n't you have a close loved one who makes his living in the theater , and who even appeared in a gay - inclusive show called SODOM ?
MAGGIE : Yea , uhm , let 's not talk about that right now .
....
So anyway , even though these couples are everywhere , and even though they earn lots more support with every passing year , I 'm doing everything in my power to keep this " culture war " idea alive .
It 's kind of my thing .
So anything I can do to divide us as a people , with LGBT people at the scapegoat -y center ?
Yea , well -- that 's a gig I 'm going to take !!
MOM : And thus the CNN appearance , dear ?
MAGGIE : And thus the CNN appearance , ma .
MOM : Well that 's just fine , dear .
It 's a wonderful thing , TV .
And just like I can tape it so that I can see you whenever I want , those nice gay couples can just go ahead and make videos of each other so that they never really have to be alone either .
MAGGIE : RIGHT !
That 's what I keep saying !
We in the heterosexual , Christian majority will allow them to do that .
Why are they so militant that they need to take their agenda into the physical realm ?!?!
MOM : I have no answers for you dear .
But Maggie , if you could now excuse me , I was actually in the middle of making a breakfast spread for my friends .
MAGGIE : Oh , nice -- what are you serving ?
MOM : I 'm doing a whole multicultural thing :
Seeing what foods marry together and can therefore stay at the table , and which recipes are unfit by virtue of their creation .
MAGGIE : Ooh , ma -- that gives me a good idea for a Food Network segment !

[' The Magic Resolution ' is a regular GameSetWatch column by UK - based writer Lewis Denby , examining all facets of the experience of playing video games .
And reading about them , it would seem , as this week , he 's been considering a feminist approach to Zombie Cow 's new game . ]
I 'm still not quite sure what I make of this article , posted on Hoyden About Town .
It 's a blog , according to its header image , about " life , laughs , science , progressive politics and foiling diabolical masterminds . "
What that roughly translates as is : a feminist blog which touches on several other topics , one that 's nicely written and picks up on some decent issues .
It 's by no means a blog about games .
But one author , going by the name of Lauredhel , noticed something untoward in a press release for Zombie Cow 's new sex education game , Privates .
From it , she deduced that " no matter how much we try to make excuses for them and work to find the positive aspects of this sort of game , the developers are dead set on regaling us with their hatred of women . "
I feel it 's important to establish something rather firmly before I go any further .
While I was n't previously familiar with Hoyden About Town , I have browsed the archives , and it appears to be smart stuff .
The comments thread on the article in question , while scattered with nastiness from both sides of the arguments for the first 50 - or - so comments , eventually developed into an interesting discussion .
The author herself has been largely absent throughout the aftermath , but other writers on the blog have been keen to engage in debate .
And , most importantly , I absolutely agree with the core message that emerges from the discussion : that certain language , whether intentionally misogynistic or not , can subtly perpetuate sexist ideas that have become engrained within our society .
So , Privates .
It 's an upcoming game from Zombie Cow , of Ben There , Dan That and Time Gentlemen , Please ! fame .
Both games are absolutely offensive and equally hilarious .
Privates is the result of a commission from UK media outlet Channel 4 , who have spoken at a number of conferences recently about their desire to reach teenage boys as part of their education remit .
The game itself features an elite squad of condom - hatted commandos who invade the unmentionable areas of various STI - infected characters , attempting to stamp out those infections .
In other words : it 's a game promoting safe sex to teenagers who 'd usually tune out during scientific and impersonal sex education lessons .
That can only be a good thing , right ?
Disembodied Genitals
Well , Hoyden About Town 's Lauredhel disagrees .
" Could a sex ed game based on STD shoot - em - up be useful ? " she initially muses , before concluding that , if so , this is n't the right way to go about it .
" This videogame sure is a good example of disembodied genitals , " she notes -- " Genitals presented as ' hostile territory ' at that , and with invading military forces not , apparently , bothering to gain any sort of consent . "
The crux of her argument is that , in its attempt to appeal to teenage boys , Privates has taken an egregious route of positioning sexual partners as nothing more than a set of genitals to conquer , and that the game displays women as filthy and disease - ridden in the process -- not , one would expect , the angle Zombie Cow were aiming for .
But that 's the first thing that nags me about the article : Lauredhel does indeed seem to think that 's exactly what they were going for .
" The authors make a stab at promoting this as a sex ed game , " she says , pointing at the press release , which begins with a tabloid - aping " Britain .
Land of Hope and Glory - holes .
Where pregnant , waddling teenagers take up the full width of the pavement with their oversized triplet pushchairs , unaware that their rampant , perpetual humping has filled them to the brim with all manner of grotty infections . "
At its most callous , the article struck me as tremendously bad reporting .
No attempt was made to contact the developer -- nor , it would seem , to position the game within its important context .
To suggest Zombie Cow were " making a stab " at promoting Privates as a sex education game seems to somewhat understate the fact that it was comissioned for exactly that purpose .
Readers arriving at the article from Rock , Paper , Shotgun 's ' The Sunday Papers ' links roundup were quick to pounce , also suggesting that the author missed the parody of the press release , which offers a sly wink at the British tabloid press ' obsession with teen pregnancy rates in the country .
Déjà Vu
And that 's when something struck me .
As the debate raged on , I thought back to something I wrote last year in this very column .
Having read an article in The Telegraph , I penned a fuming rebuttal to what , at the time , I felt was an entirely horrible article about women 's boyfriends being unceremoniously stolen by an addiction to Modern Warfare 2 .
Read it here , and try not to cringe as much as I did when you realise what 's going on .
Because , indeed , I was later informed by a friend of mine who writes for The Telegraph that Hannah Betts ' piece was -- you guessed it -- intended as a parody of the videogame - fearing tabloid press .
The same tabloid press that Zombie Cow lay into in their press release -- and I was quick enough off the mark with that one .
Oops .
And yet , while I 'm all too aware that I might have made a bit of a blunder there , in a way I stand by what I wrote all those months ago .
Joke or no joke , certain language does have the potential to perpetuate nasty ideas .
" It 's just a gag " does n't cut it .
I know this having studied language and gender at university ; if you 've thrown your life into feminist theory , press releases like Zombie Cow 's are always going to stir up some rage inside you .
And it 's a shame .
It 's absolutely a shame , because as it turns out , neither Hannah Bets nor Zombie Cow intended any offense whatsoever with what they wrote .
Instead , they both attempted to address a very specific audience , while subtly mocking those who do not share their ideals .
And in both cases , someone got offended -- in the first case it was me ; in the second , Lauredhel .
I think Privates is a great idea .
I think it 's bang on target in terms of promoting safe sex to adolescent males -- and unless things have changed dramatically in the last seven years , goodness knows the UK's National Curriculum is n't doing so well in that respect .
But now , I re-read the press release , and while a part of me still cracks a smile , another part cringes .
I do n't think Hoyden About Town 's reporting was strong .
I do think that both sides of the debate in the comments thread went alarmingly overboard , often refusing to listen to the opposing point of view .
But I do think the author has a point .
If you 're making a sex education game , you 're dealing with serious issues -- and unless you take that absolutely seriously , you 're always at risk of dropping the ball .
You have no idea how strong the urge was to make a gag about that last line .

Grants a passive bonus to damage and damage resistance to nearby allies .
He has access to a class - restricted Bolt Pistol with a Chainsword / Powerfist and has general all - around abilities .
They are also capable of throwing extra amounts of explosive ordnance , and may find class - restricted ammo caches on the field for his Bolt Pistol .
The Sergeant will also be able to use the Thunder Hammer and Plasma Rifle .
Devastator Marine ( Special Weapons )
Brings raw damage to the table and starts out with the Heavy Bolter with superior parameters , high magazine capacity , and auto aiming ability .
When reaching a high enough level , the Devastator Marine gains access to the real deal , Heavy Bolter with the backpack ammo carrier .
The Devastator Marine can pick up class - restricted ammo caches on the field and has acces to the class restricted Rocket Launcher and Plasma Cannon .
His only weakness is that he needs to be stationary while firing his heavier weapons like the Plasma Cannon .
Apothecary ( Medic )
Is able to equip and deploy temporary healing beacons , and at a high enough level can use a " healing gun " to selectively heal teammates and themselves .
He has access to a class - restricted Bolt Pistol with a Chainsword .
The Apothecary , while fighting near the Sergeant gains bonus in melee damage and damage when using the Shotgun .
Tech Marine ( Tech )
Carries a motion sensor , can deploy Tarantula Sentry Guns on the field and is the only class capable of unlocking certain door panels or completing certain objectives by means of a hacking minigame .

Norwich City manager Daniel Farke has hailed the talents of Christian Pulisic and believes the attacker has the credentials to become one of the best offensive players in the world .
The USA international signed for the Blues from Borussia Dortmund in January but he only made the move this summer after he was loaned back to the German side for the backend of the 2018 / 19 season .
Speaking in a press conference , Farke , who was formerly a youth coach at Dortmund , said that he has a good knowledge about the qualities of the forward , who initially developed through the reserve squad at BVB , he told : “ Top class player .
I would take him but we had no chance .
We worked together in Dortmund , not directly together because I was not responsible for the first team and at this time Christian was with the under - 19 s but involved several times in the first team .
He will have a great career , I am pretty sure , and this big money move was totally deserved .
For Chelsea a great decision to buy him .
He is one of the biggest offensive talents in the whole world . ”
Pulisic joined the Blues after a couple of games into pre-season and he was impressive for the club with a run of consistent performances .
The same has not been replicated at the start of the real campaign with just one assist from three matches but the 20 - year - old should find the mojo with more gametime on the playing field .
Chelsea are scheduled to face Norwich City on the road this weekend where they will be aiming to secure the first triumph of the new season .
The Canaries have a weakness in terms of the defensive play but rest assured , they will offer a strong challenge to the Blues , who are yet to preserve a clean sheet in any competition .
BP 's Oil Disaster The Dangers and Difficulties of ' Bottom Kill '
BP has only one arrow left in its quiver , a method known as ' bottom kill . '
The idea is for relief wells to stop the gushing oil from below , but the technical challenges are formidable .
Past experiences show that the oil may continue flowing into late autumn .
Summer doldrums weighed on the video game industry in June , with U.S. retail sales of hardware , software and accessories down 6 percent from a year earlier , to $ 1.1 billion .
Market researcher NPD Group said Thursday that sales of game software tumbled 15 percent to $ 531.3 million .
Analysts were generally expecting a smaller decline .
Hardware sales climbed 5 percent to $ 401.7 million .
NPD Analyst Anita Frazier said Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox 360 and Sony Corp. ’s PlayStation 3 saw unit sales increase notably from a year earlier .
Although Nintendo ’s handheld DS was the month ’s best - selling game system , the Xbox 360 surpassed Nintendo ’s Wii with the number of units sold .
June was unusual in that software sales fell while hardware sales increased , said Jesse Divnich , an analyst with Electronic Entertainment Design and Research .
Last month ’s discrepancy , he added , could have resulted from people replacing older consoles with new ones .
The Xbox also got a boost from a new model put out by Microsoft last month — one that ’s smaller , sleeker and has a bigger hard drive .
As in May , Take - Two Interactive Software Inc. ’s “ Red Dead Redemption ” for the Xbox 360 was the month ’s best - selling title .
The game is now the best - selling game of 2010 , NPD said .
Nintendo ’s “ Super Mario Galaxy 2 ” for the Wii was in second place .
And in an unusual showing for a game based on a movie , “ Toy Story 3 ” from Disney Interactive Studios , a unit of The Walt Disney Co. , also made it in the top 10 .
“ There has been a downward trend ( both in quality and sales ) , for movie based games , ” Divnich said .
“ The presence of ‘ Toy Story 3 ’ shows that as long as you focus on quality , there is certainly a consumer base for these types of games . ”
Total industry sales for the year through the end of June were down 9 percent to $ 6.66 billion compared with the same six - month period last year .
Even so , Frazier said the industry , which brings in the bulk of its money in the holiday season , could still pull in $ 20 billion for the full year .
A strong slate of games to come , and new motion controllers from Sony and Microsoft will likely give games a boost , she said .

I 'm not going to spend much time here introducing you to the late , great , and much loved Richard Feynman .
To me , besides his being one of our finest intellectuals , scientists , theorists and technicians ( from back in the day when a person could be all those things at once ) , Richard Feynman was one of the better humans to ever breath God 's air .
This was a good man .
Dr. Feynman pretty much defined modern disaster forensics with his work on the Presidential panel which investigated the Challenger disaster .
From Wikipedia :
Feynman played an important role on the Presidential Rogers Commission , which investigated the Challenger disaster .
Feynman devoted the latter half of his book What Do You Care What Other People Think ? to his experience on the Rogers Commission , straying from his usual convention of brief , light - hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative .
Feynman 's account reveals a disconnect between NASA 's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected .
His interviews of NASA 's high - ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts .
He concluded that the NASA management 's space shuttle reliability estimate was fantastically unrealistic .
He warned in his appendix to the commission 's report , " For a successful technology , reality must take precedence over public relations , for nature cannot be fooled . "
You can read the full text of Feynman 's Personal observations on the reliability of the Shuttle , HERE .
I encourage everyone interested in the current BP Gulf Oil Leak Disaster , and the possibility of more deep drilling in the Gulf , to read that .
I would like Thad Allen to read it .
I would like Secretary of Energy Chu to read it .
I would like President Obama to read it ...
RIGHT NOW .
Last Sunday , I was doing an informal sound check with Jay Ackroyd for my upcoming , August 5th appearance on Virtually Speaking .
Jay mentioned Feynman 's work on the Challenger disaster and how he thought it related to this present mess and future messes .
So HAT TIP ... JAY !
My friend Bob Cavnar wrote an excellent piece for The Huffington Post today .
You 've probably seen Bob on with Keith Olbermann , Chris Matthews , Rachel Maddow and other shows on MSNBC .
He 's their go - to guy on this BP Leak Disaster and they could not have picked anyone more knowledgable , more experienced or more level - headed .
I 've talked with Bob quite a lot these last couple of weeks and I can tell you that this fellow knows his shit about oil and gas drilling and production .
When Kossacks have a question about oil & gas , many of them ask me .
When I have a question , I ask Bob Cavnar .
Robert L. Cavnar -- Well Integrity Test - Where Did That Come From ?
I enourage you to read the entire article .
It 's one of the very best technical critiques I 've read since ... well , since Richard Feynman .
I 'm sorry , but I have to ask , What the hell are they doing ?
We now have an ability to capture all the oil and stop this massive pollution of the Gulf ( as well as measure it ) .
We have great weather to get the relief well completed .
We already know , without the " well integrity test " , that they have severe damage to the BOP and other surface equipment and casing .
If that were n't true , the damn thing would n't have blown out in the first place .
We also know that between the " capping stack " and the old BOP that there is a non-wellhead rated piece of equipment , known as the flex joint , along with the riser adapter , that we 've talked about before .
This piece of equipment , that normally sits above the BOP , is not rated to nearly those pressures encountered by wellhead equipment .
All of the other components in this BOP are rated to at least 10,000 psi ( new , off the shelf , and undamaged ) ; this piece is by far the weakest link in the chain , especially since it took severe stresses as the rig sank and 5,000 feet of riser torqued it as it sank .
Yesterday , Adm .
Allen announced they were going to take the stack , including this flex joint , to as high as 9,000 psi for up to 48 hours .
I have been unable to learn the model and rating of the flex joint here , but Oil States advertises their LMRP flex joints to be rated 600 - 6,000 psi , far below the 9,000 to which Adm Allen said they would potentially go ; even with the 2,200 psi of hydrostatic pressure on the outside of the compenent caused by it being in 5,000 feet of water , it 's still at least 1,000 psi differential pressure over the rating of the component .
We later received information that the Oil States FlexJoint actually in place is a Model 5 , and therefore has a MWP ( maximum working pressure ) of 5000 psi .
So now , the pressures Our Government has signed off on applying , are at least 2,000 psi differential pressure over the rating of the component !
We can sense the Ghost of Richard Feynman perk up his ears .
I 've been battling comments that , surely , this component has a " safety allowance " well above its rating .
Boomers , this is pure horseshit .
When you 're pressuring up against metal with hydrocarbons , the " maximum " in " maximum working pressure " fucking means MAXIMUM .
Purposefully exceeding MWP is , in fact , criminally actionable .
MWP is enforced in the Oil & Gas industry with perfect vigor .
There is no tolerance for exceeding MWP .
None .
Never .
Ever .
You .
Don't .
Fucking .
Do .
It .
BP is PLANNING on doing it !
They would not and could not do it without the U.S. Government taking full responsibility , in the name of Thad Allen , for the consequences of over - pressuring the FlexJoint .
We can see the Ghost of Richard Feynman raise an eyebrow and look at us over his glasses .
More from Bob 's excellent HuffPo piece :
This morning , we learned that , even thought the stack has now been set for 3 days , they actually have n't hooked up the two new valves .
He [ BP's Wells ] also announced that yesterday , they pulled all of the ships off site to run a seismic survey , and , alarmingly , have stopped drilling the relief well , which is now only 4 feet away laterally from the blowout well .
Since Dudley 's letter to Adm .
Allen last Friday laying out the relief well timeline , they have made little progress and have only 34 more feet to drill before they get to casing point for the last string of pipe .
34 feet , and they stopped .
They 're just sitting there circulating on bottom at 17,840 .
Just sitting there .
That 's alarming enough , but there are many bad things that can happen when you 're just sitting there circulating on bottom at 17,840 ...
FOR DAYS .
Now that they 're having problems with the choke on the capping stack , it might easily be DAYS AND DAYS .
You can lose circulation and get stuck .
You can lose a mud pump for a matter of minutes and get stuck .
You can lose the section of un - cased hole you just drilled ( which is at a critical point for the intercept ) and make directional control much more difficult getting it back .
There are more , and worse things that could happen , but I wo n't mention them because the crew and equipment on that relief well are the absolute best , and none of those worse things will happen .
But why take these risks ?
For what ?
The first relief well is SO close ( now stopped ) !
They have the ability to capture and measure ALL the oil !
We already KNOW there is damage downhole !
Why would the Government of the United States of America sign off on , and take responsibility for this foolishness ?
To avoid a single Drudge headline :
OBAMA TO BP : DON'T SHUT IN WELL !
I need to include here that I think this " test " is probably a good political and public relations bet for both the Obama administration and BP .
It 's really not a test at all and has no chance of actually testing anything about the well , except their ability to shut it in with no surface leaks .
They want to shut in the well and get it off the nightly news .
They want that so badly they 're willing to risk anything for it .
That 's both BP and Our Government .
They shut in the well and Thad Allen is a hero .
They fail and he's no more of a moron than he has been for the last three months .
If they succeed in shutting it in or not , any damage they 've done in the " test " that makes the kill operation more difficult , or even impossible , will be a matter of opinion .
This bet is against the citizens of the United States of America being smart enough to figure any of this out .
It 's not a bet on actual physical outcomes .
It has nothing at all to do with what 's the best plan for stopping this disaster .
Politics .
Public Relations .
If any of these bad things happen , look for the Ghost of Richard Feynman to show up at the investigatory hearings .
He 'll be easy to spot .
First , you 'll hear bongo drums .
With a relaxed look at everyone in attendance , Dr. Feynman will ask us how this could possibly happen .
Do n't people learn from disasters ?
Then he 'll get down to the job of figuring it out .
He 'll find a target - rich environment .

EVERYONE should be able to comment on Daily Kos , regardless of their browser choice .
It was the scandal that never was , which was the true scandal .
It was one of the most shameful episodes in the annals of climate change denialism , and given the desperate efforts of the corporate interests that profit so mightily off such staggering irresponsibility , that 's no mean feat .
But so many traditional media outlets have become little more than propaganda arms of their corporate owners that their obscuring , obfuscating and sometimes just plain lying about the scientific facts is just more of the same .
It 's only the most dangerous crisis humanity has ever faced , but to them that 's less important than their rapacious greed .
It 's time for a bloggers ' ethics conference .
The real story was that thieves hacked the private emails of respected climate scientists .
That 's a crime .
That should have been at least part of the focus of the reporting : a false scandal was being concocted by people who were , at face value , criminals .
But the larger part of the story was that it was a deliberate effort to distort and distract from the scientific facts .
That , too , should have been at least part of the reporting .
Instead , so many major media outlets played along , ignoring the criminality , and propagating the distortions and lies exactly as the criminals wanted .
Even though the distortions and lies were easily debunked .
All it took was intelligence and integrity , rarely found in the major media , although they could be found , elsewhere .
One of the best concise refutations of the false scandal came from our own DarkSyde , one of those lowly blogger types .
Brian Angliss of Scholars & Rogues provided one of the best comprehensive refutations , in a series of posts : here , here , here , and here .
Another of those bloggers .
And a couple weeks back , Salon 's Alex Pareene had what should be , but certainly wo n't be , the false scandal 's death knell :
It was obvious to anyone who actually bothered to read the stolen " climategate " emails that they did n't actually contain anything particularly scandalous , and they certainly did n't contain anything at all that remotely called into the question the legitimacy of years of science demonstrating the effect of human activity on climate change .
But once the name " climategate " was affixed to the trumped - up non-scandal and printed in large type in a major newspaper , it did n't matter what the emails said .
Not a whit .
Emails , scandal , " - gate " -- there must be something to this !
There was n't .
He points to a Newsweek article by Sharon Begley :
A lie can get halfway around the world while the truth is still putting its boots on , as Mark Twain said ( or “ before the truth gets a chance to put its pants on , ” in Winston Churchill ’s version ) , and nowhere has that been more true than in " climategate . "
In that highly orchestrated , manufactured scandal , e-mails hacked from computers at the University of East Anglia ’s climate - research group were spread around the Web by activists who deny that human activity is altering the world ’s climate in a dangerous way , and spun so as to suggest that the scientists had been lying , cheating , and generally cooking the books .
But not only did British investigators clear the East Anglia scientist at the center of it all , Phil Jones , of scientific impropriety and dishonesty in April , an investigation at Penn State cleared PSU climatologist Michael Mann of “ falsifying or suppressing data , intending to delete or conceal e-mails and information , and misusing privileged or confidential information ” in February .
In perhaps the biggest backpedaling , The Sunday Times of London , which led the media pack in charging that IPCC reports were full of egregious ( and probably intentional ) errors , retracted its central claim — namely , that the IPCC statement that up to 40 percent of the Amazonian rainforest could be vulnerable to climate change was “ unsubstantiated . ”
The Times also admitted that it had totally twisted the remarks of one forest expert to make it sound as if he agreed that the IPCC had screwed up , when he said no such thing .
And she quotes the retraction :
The article also quoted criticism of the IPCC ’s use of the WWF report by Dr Simon Lewis , a Royal Society research fellow at the University of Leeds and leading specialist in tropical forest ecology .
We accept that , in his quoted remarks , Dr Lewis was making the general point that both the IPCC and WWF should have cited the appropriate peer - reviewed scientific research literature .
As he made clear to us at the time , including by sending us some of the research literature , Dr Lewis does not dispute the scientific basis for both the IPCC and the WWF reports ’ statements on the potential vulnerability of the Amazon rainforest to droughts caused by climate change .
. . .
A version of our article that had been checked with Dr Lewis underwent significant late editing and so did not give a fair or accurate account of his views on these points .
We apologise for this .
That last section is astonishing , and demands clarification .
Who was responsible for that late editing , and to what purpose ?
At the very least , it sounds like a case of profoundly incompetent journalism .
But it seems at least as likely to have been a deliberate attempt to sabotage the truth , to concoct a false narrative , and to undermine efforts to raise the public awareness about climate change that might create the political climate necessary to deal with it .
The retraction does n't come close to going far enough , but it is a start .
The science of the issue long has been overwhelming .
The international consensus of scientists leaves no doubt .
But that rarely dents public consciousness the way this false scandal did .
And the traditional media very much are to blame .
The name " Climategate " went viral , whereas those scientific facts are pretty much ignored .
Now that the truth is known , and the lies are revealed , will the traditional media begin to pay more attention to those scientific facts ?
We all know that the question answers itself .
On the most important issue humanity has ever faced , one of the world 's best - known newspapers was complicit in promoting lies and obfuscating the truth , becoming the Judith Millers of climate change .
Many powerful media outlets played right along .
Meanwhile , it was mostly left to lowly bloggers to investigate and report the reality .
On this most important of issues , the difference between old media and new could not have been more explicitly delineated .
In a word , it 's called credibility .
And despite its lack of credibility , the power of old media was revealed in Pareene 's closing question :
Anyway now that The Times has corrected the record , everyone will agree to do something about carbon emissions , right ?
Of course , if new media were as powerful as old , it would be impossible for politicians to avoid that question .
Because the public , worldwide , would n't allow them to .
Do you have photographs that show wildlife at its greatest — how nature intended it to be ?

The liquid inside the test tube is neon green , the color of lime Kool - Aid or the mad - scientist potions found only in comic books .
Perhaps it ’s fitting , then , that the contents come with a whiff of danger .
They are a mixture of marijuana and solvents , stirred together in a furious swirl by a lab technician wearing protective goggles and latex gloves .
Running the concoction through a $ 70,000 machine , the technician can learn with scientific precision the plant ’s unique chemical makeup , its potency , even its growing method .
The ultimate goal ?
Find out how good it is .
“ We ’re not going to be taken seriously unless we have proof , ” said Michael Lee , the owner of the lab and its adjacent medical - marijuana dispensary , Cannabis Therapeutics .
This is the new science of pot , part of a fresh wave of study and innovation among scientists and cannabis advocates all seeking to solve a central dilemma :
In Colorado and other states , first came the approval of marijuana as medicine .
Next comes the challenge of proving its effectiveness .
The newest research leaves little doubt that marijuana — or at least its chemical components — has promise in alleviating symptoms of some ailments , while also making clear that the drug is not without its drawbacks , some potentially serious .
What is less certain is whether Colorado ’s medical - marijuana system of dispensaries and caregivers — where commitment to scientific rigor and compassionate patient care is largely voluntary — can maximize that treatment potential for the benefit of patients .
Some dispensaries keep detailed patient records and embrace scientific testing in the hopes of providing patients with what works best .
But medical - marijuana users report other dispensaries seem interested in just slinging snazzy weed , regardless of a patient ’s needs or ailments .
( One ad on Craigslist : “ Licensed caregiver looking to trade for Widespread Panic tickets . ” )
The mainstream medical community , meanwhile , questions whether any system that uses a raw plant as medicine can be optimally effective .
Instead , conventional drug researchers see promise mostly in harvesting marijuana ’s ingredients for more traditional medicines and avoiding consumption methods like smoking that can hurt patients ’ health .
“ If there is any future for marijuana as a medicine , ” a panel of experts wrote in a landmark 1999 report for the National Academy of Science ’s Institute of Medicine , “ it lies in its isolated components . ”
Most marijuana advocates enthusiastically embrace a future in which pot is as much an accepted medicine as penicillin .
But that future might not come without significant changes to the way medical marijuana is handled .
New medicines require new tests and government approvals .
Those lead to new regulations and new oversight .
There is a focus on standardization , sterility , precision , discipline .
If there were ever a world where marijuana was available behind the counter at the corner pharmacy , the do - it - yourself independence of Colorado ’s — and many other states ’ — medical - marijuana system might not have a place .
The bud could become obsolete , and dispensaries — both medically inclined and not — could go extinct with it .
Indeed , not every marijuana supporter is watching the development of cannabis - based pharmaceuticals enthusiastically .
“ When they get through the FDA with their cannabis - based drugs , no legislature in the country will allow doctors and patients access to whole , smoked marijuana , ” said Allen St. Pierre , the executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , or NORML .
Medical mystery
Medical marijuana has n’t always been a strictly on - your - own endeavor .
Historians have found references to the use of cannabis by healers in China and India dating back to at least 2000 B.C. The Irish physician William O’Shaughnessy wrote about the medical uses of cannabis in the mid-1800s .
Cannabis - based treatments were commonly prescribed in the early 1900s in America before marijuana prohibition , which came about in the 1930s because of concerns over the drug ’s psychoactive effects and fears they could lead to criminal behavior .
What was missing , though , was an understanding of how marijuana provided its touted medical benefits — or , for that matter , even a basic understanding of how marijuana gets people stoned .
“ We knew marijuana has effects , ” said Bob Melamede , a biology professor at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and a prominent marijuana activist .
“ So the question was , ‘ How does it have them ? ’ “
Answers arrived starting in the late 1980s with the discovery in the body of something called the endocannabinoid system .
The system acts much like a traffic - control network , with receptors spread out across the brain , the organs , the immune system and various other areas to regulate functions as diverse as appetite , mood and pain .
Using chemicals produced in the body called cannabinoids as traffic cops , the body turns on or off those receptors and controls the different functions .
Sending certain cannabinoids to one receptor and flipping it on , for instance , stimulates appetite .
Tripping another dampens the body ’s inflammatory response .
Marijuana also contains cannabinoids that can fit into the endocannabinoid system ’s receptors — purely “ pot luck , ” Melamede cracks .
Ingesting marijuana unleashes into the bloodstream swarms of new cannabinoid molecules that quickly begin linking into the system and flipping switches .
This explains both the medical and recreational effects of the drug — which in many cases are one and the same .
By jiggering with the receptors that control appetite , for instance , marijuana creates the much - joked - about munchies .
But it is that same effect that spurs the appetites and calms the stomachs of cancer and AIDS patients .
In the same way marijuana impairs the motor skills of some users , it can also calm the painful muscle spasticity of multiple sclerosis patients .
Highs and lows
There is no scientific consensus that marijuana cures any disease or ailment .
But research generally suggests smoking marijuana has pain - killing , muscle - calming , nausea - controlling and appetite - boosting effects in many patients .
That means studies have shown marijuana can provide benefits to patients suffering from each of the eight different medical conditions specified in the state ’s medical - marijuana constitutional amendment .
Scientists , though , disagree to what extent marijuana is beneficial and whether marijuana is more effective in those areas than existing treatments .
Medical - marijuana supporters , meanwhile , cite other studies hinting at benefits in treating anxiety disorders , post - traumatic stress disorder and many other conditions .
The effects also vary from user to user , and using marijuana is not without its risks .
Studies have shown smoking marijuana may be more harmful to the lungs than smoking cigarettes .
Other studies suggest marijuana could lead to increased anxiety or more severe mental - health problems in some people and dependence in others .
Marijuana is the most commonly cited drug for people seeking treatment for illicit drug abuse , according to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration .
Mostly , though , mainstream medical - marijuana studies and research reviews conclude that more thorough clinical trials of the drug are needed .
Those follow - up studies are made difficult by federal drug - control laws , which place tight restrictions on marijuana research .
The proliferation of state medical - marijuana programs has been of little use to researchers , said Cecilia Hillard , a neuroscience professor at the Medical College of Wisconsin and a past president of the International Cannabinoid Research Society .
Participants in those programs are self - selected , she said .
That means those patients are pre-disposed to thinking marijuana will help , further muddying the scientific analysis of raw marijuana ’s benefits and drawbacks .
“ It ’s hard to say how much people are really using it medicinally versus recreationally , ” Hillard said .
“ Right now we ’re sort of to a point where the claims of medical benefit are so numerous and so over - the - top that you tend to get into the realm of , ‘ Well , I just do n’t believe any of this . ’
People are saying it ’s good for everything . ”
A handful of recent clinical trials — the first clinical trials of smoked marijuana in this country in 20 years — have provided some clarity .
After being tasked by the California state legislature , the University of California at San Diego ’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research sponsored about a half - dozen placebo - controlled trials to assess whether marijuana is effective as a painkiller for HIV and multiple sclerosis patients and for people suffering from nerve damage .
Across the board , the trials found some promise in marijuana as a treatment option .
“ I was a little bit surprised , to tell the truth , ” said Igor Grant , the center ’s director .
“ I somewhat expected that what we would get is a mixed result . . . which would not be so unusual .
But the fact that all of them came up with a consistent result makes me feel a little more comfortable in saying we could have something here . ”
That does not mean , however , that Grant is ready to proclaim marijuana as a miracle treatment .
For starters , patients in the trials generally continued on the drugs they were already taking for their conditions and used marijuana to supplement .
Second , Grant said , smoking marijuana is just too impractical a delivery method for medicine .
Among the questions :
How do you control the dosage ?
“ Would you prescribe smoking cannabis cigarettes in a hospital room where oxygen tanks may be present ? ”
Grant asked .
“ The great likelihood is that we need alternative systems . ”
And that is exactly where marijuana ’s pharmaceutical gold rush is taking place .
Separating help from high
Sitting at lunch one day recently in a restaurant near his UCCS office , Melamede , the biology professor , reaches into his jeans pocket and pulls out two small vials containing inky green liquid .
They are marijuana extracts , he explains , formulas carefully measured for potency and chemical makeup that can be taken under the tongue in a predictable dosage .
He also has ideas for marijuana skin patches , tongue strips and lozenges , all part of a new publicly traded pharmaceutical venture he has embarked on called Cannabis Science .
“ The key thing is , ” he said , “ we ’re addressing the government ’s concern that smoked marijuana is not medicine . ”
Cannabis Science recently hired a company to help it negotiate the Food and Drug Administration approval process , and Melamede said he is hopeful it wo n’t be long before the company can begin clinical trials targeting veterans with post - traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain patients .
But Melamede knows he is already behind in the race .
GW Pharmaceuticals , a British firm , is currently preparing for its final clinical trials in the United States on a drug called Sativex , a marijuana - derived mouth spray the company intends as a treatment for cancer pain .
The drug has already won approval in Canada and Great Britain and is in the last stages of approval in Spain .
What makes Sativex unique among current pharmaceuticals is that it is a blend of natural cannabinoids made directly from marijuana plants — grown in southern England — rather than synthetic re-creations of marijuana components , like drugs such as Marinol .
GW believes such an approach will yield better medicine , and it is already experimenting with other cannabinoid combinations for new drugs .
“ There are more than 60 cannabinoids in the cannabis plant , so we believe that leaves plenty of scope for future development , ” GW spokesman Mark Rogerson wrote in an e-mail .
Most exciting to those looking to establish marijuana ’s potential benefits as medicine in a more socially accepted form is a cannabinoid called cannabidiol , or CBD .
A batch of new studies suggest it may have medical effects like THC — the chemical in marijuana that gets a user stoned .
But it eliminates the psychoactivity produced by THC .
In other words , it ’s medical pot that wo n’t get you high .
Colorado dispensaries have begun to stock marijuana strains high in CBD .
But to tout a strain as being CBD - rich , it helps inspire consumer confidence to prove that it is , which is where laboratory testing comes in .
Using pricey machines called high - performance liquid chromatography systems , medical - marijuana labs can detail the percentages of THC , CBD and a handful of other cannabinoids in the plant .
The lab work is unchecked by the government and is performed only by labs either connected to or hired by dispensaries .
A number of dispensaries across the state now routinely place little cards detailing the test results next to each strain in their display cases .
Patients can use the cards to pick marijuana suited to their need based on the numbers and not the strain names , which are n’t always descriptive of a strain ’s effects .
“ We hope to take the mystery out of the names and put in more science , ” said Frank Quattrone , the owner of Pure Medical Dispensary in Denver . “. . .
The names , hopefully , will become irrelevant . ”
Dispensaries have also used the laboratory analysis as a guide in developing more potent product .
Cannabis Therapeutics in Colorado Springs has developed a hash oil — essentially concentrated marijuana — that it touts as 86 percent THC .
( Even the most knock - out marijuana buds are usually no more than 20 percent THC . )
Andreas Rivera , Cannabis Therapeutics ’ manager , says the oil will only be sold to terminally ill patients as a form of palliative care .
“ It ’s really about pain management instead of getting people super stoned , ” he said .
But the availability — and marketability — of such products raises a question :
Are patients actually using the analyses to find the best medicine or the best high ?
Inside Cannabis
Therapeutics , it is clear most patients currently see only limited value in the new data .
Some ask about the numbers , but their eyes quickly glaze over during the explanation .
Others skip the numbers entirely , instead choosing by past experience or the much cruder ratio of how much “ upper ” versus “ downer ” the strain contains .
Most patients rely to some extent on the advice of the woman working behind the counter , Julie Anderson .
“ I usually ask Julie what the best she ’s got is , ” said patient Frederick Ross , who suffers from such severe appetite loss because of various medical conditions that he eats only once a day .
“ I do n’t play the numbers . ”
But some patients have taken an interest in the new data .
One woman with kinky , waist - length , brown hair crouched in front of the counter to study the numbers for several minutes before making her selection .
She said she has been writing down the THC and CBD ratios of the strains she ’s tried and has used the data to guide her decisions .
“ I ’m trying to apply some analysis to it and some logic based on the information I have , ” explained the woman , who asked that her name not be used because she did n’t want her co-workers to know she is a medical - marijuana patient .
“ Hopefully I can make a more - educated decision . ”
Whatever the efforts by dispensaries to put more science behind their products , though , they ’re likely to be met with a sniff from the pharmaceutical industry , which believes most people will never accept taking medicine by smoking a raw plant .
“ The current system of distribution may actually prevent cannabis from ever being accepted as a mainstream medicine by most patients and physicians , ” GW ’s Rogerson said .
People in the medical - marijuana business naturally bristle at such talk .
But among some there is a sense that wider acceptability of marijuana by the medical world might actually restrict marijuana access .
State medical - marijuana programs , NORML ’s St. Pierre explained , function as relative oases for cannabis access — bypassing a whole set of federal rules because the federal government simply refuses to participate .
Right now , marijuana is legally a Schedule I controlled substance because the federal government sees no accepted medical use for it and considers it to have a high potential for abuse .
That classification means doctors can’t prescribe it and pharmacists can’t distribute it .
If marijuana were to be placed in a less - restrictive classification — as a petition currently pending with the Drug Enforcement Administration requests — doctors potentially would be able to prescribe it .
That ability , though , would bring with it Food and Drug Administration oversight , production controls , inventory caps , distribution limits , security rules and more .
Plus , with a federally blessed system to get patients cannabis in the same way they get cholesterol drugs , why would most state governments continue with their jury - rigged medical - marijuana systems ?
“ We see this as a boxed canyon , ” St. Pierre said .
Limitless learning
Back at Cannabis Therapeutics ’ lab , John Kopta — a Colorado State University biochemistry grad who runs the facility — is more optimistic .
Only a few other labs in the country , mostly connected to the medical - marijuana industry , are doing what his does .
The more study they do , the more proof they have .
The more proof they have , the more they can lead the way forward .
“ There ’s dozens of different cannabinoids in the plant , and we know of 10 of them and what they do , ” he said .
“ It ’s really limitless . ”

Of
the more recent gameplay
details revealed for upcoming href = " http://www.tentonhammer.com/gw2 ">Guild
Wars 2 ,
the article on href= " http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/86589 ">Healing
and Death at the official site
for the game
contains perhaps the most interesting announcements to date .
Between
the vastly different approach to how death will work and the lack of a
dedicated healing class , these mechanics certainly help illustrate a
very divergent path from traditional MMOG templates the team at
ArenaNet is taking with their newest title .
When we first read about the
removal of a dedicated healing class and
the additional downed state , rallying and revive mechanics , we here at
the Ten Ton Hammer Guild Wars
2 community site were curious
to learn
more .
Jon Peters , Game Developer for Guild
Wars 2 at
ArenaNet was
awesome enough to provide us some fresh insights on each of these
areas , as well as some expanded info on whether or not we can expect
things to function differently in PvP .

Ten
Ton Hammer :
While the ability to
revive fallen allies or help them
rally back into battle should make for some excellent group play ,
what 's to prevent the " downed state " from simply prolonging the
inevitable dirt nap when playing solo ?
Jon
Peters :
The short answer is
rallying .
You can use the fact that you
rally back to life from downed when you get a kill to setup tactical
situations where you keep yourself alive in more difficult battles .
If
you should fail to rally , you can wait for someone to revive you .
Because everyone in Guild
Wars 2 can revive anyone else ,
and because we
do some things to encourage reviving other players , our experience is
that if you just give it a little while someone will come revive you .
Of course , failing that , you can always revive yourself by travelling
to a waypoint and then get back into the action quickly .
Ten
Ton Hammer :
While not nearly as
fun as the systems announced for
Guild Wars 2 ,
the death penalty in the original Guild
Wars does help to
turn the tide of battle in PvP once you manage to defeat key members of
the opposing team .
Will the downed state and associated abilities , and
the rally mechanic function differently in PvP than it does in PvE
situations to help prevent stalemates in the same way ?
Jon
Peters : Predominantly , death ,
rallying , and revival works the same
way in PvP as it does in PvE .
The one distinction is that in the same
way that a player interacts with an ally to revive them , a player can
interact with an enemy in PvP to do a strong finishing move that sends
them straight to defeated .
Of course this does help break
stalemates ,
however , Guild Wars 2
PvP is just a different beast and the concept of
the Guild Wars
1 Mexican flag standoff , where everyone is just
posturing until there is a tiny opening that has a small chance of
accomplishing anything is something we are trying to avoid .
Guild
Wars
2 is a game about killing , not
a game about not dying .
It is more about
taking risks and heroic actions and that is one of the reasons that the
death penalty system has been removed .

Ten
Ton Hammer : Our readers seem
very intrigued with the idea of groups
centered around the roles of damage , control and support .
With no
dedicated healing class for the game , will players who still enjoy
offering that style of support be able to create builds within certain
professions to essentially function in a dedicated healing role , or
will " healing " as we know it take on a broader meaning to encompass the
interactions between various professions within a group ?
Jon
Peters :
There is no way for a
character to make a completely
dedicated healing or support roles .
That being said , there are builds
that can be made that do have a significant amount of support , and we
find that our active and dynamic combat creates support situations that
do n’t rely on skills that would normally be considered
support skills .
For instance , if an ally is low
on health any other
player could simply step between them and their enemies and force
ranged attackers to hit them instead .
Similarly , if an enemy is
unleashing a powerful attack on an ally that might send them to downed
or defeated , any player that has built there character with some
control might stop the attack from happening which is a very active
sort of defense .
To paraphrase a common catch phrase :
The best defense
is a good offense .
Ten
Ton Hammer :
The concept of
skills between professions interacting
in interesting ways has come up once again in the most recent reveal .
Will there be any way of knowing which skills can be used in
conjunction with one another during combat ( like shooting arrows
through an elementalist 's fire wall ) such as on - screen alerts or
highlighted skills on your bar , or will that come down to a matter of
trial and error for teams to find the most effective skill combos ?
Jon
Peters :
For the most part ,
cross-profession combos come down to
trial and error .
These things are fairly natural combinations in the
world and we want players to discover this emergent gameplay though
experimentation .
Ten Ton Hammer would like to
thank Jon Peters and the rest of the Guild
Wars 2 team at ArenaNet for
providing us with some additional
information on how the downed state , rallying and healing will work in
their upcoming title .

I might have guessed it .
CNN has fired one of its senior Middle East editors , Octavia Nasr , for publishing a twitter – or twatter in this case , I suppose – extolling Grand Ayatollah Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah of Lebanon , calling him " one of Hizbollah 's giants whom I respect a lot " .
Well , he was n't Hizbollah 's man , but no matter .
He was definitely a giant .
A man of immense learning and jurisprudence , a believer in women 's rights , a hater of " honour crimes " , a critic of the theocratic system of government in Iran , a ...
Well , I 'd better be careful because I might get a phone call from Parisa Khosravi , who goes by the title of CNN's " senior vice president " – what these boss types do or what they get paid for their gutless decisions I have no idea – who said this week that she had " had a conversation " with Nasr ( who'd been with the company for 20 years ) and " we have decided that she will be leaving the company " .
Oh deary , deary .
Poor old CNN goes on getting more cowardly by the hour .
That 's why no one cares about it any more .
That can't be said about Fadlallah .
The Americans put it about that he had blessed the suicide bomber who struck the US marine base in Beirut in 1983 , killing 241 service personnel .
Fadlallah always denied this to me and I believe him .
Suicide bombers , however insane we regard them , do n't need to be blessed ; they think they are doing God 's duty without any help from a marja like Fadlallah .
But anyway , Washington used Saudi money to arrange a car bombing to assassinate Fadlallah in 1985 .
It missed Fadlallah .
But it killed more than 80 innocent people .
I do wonder what Ms Khosravi would have thought of that .
No comment , I guess .
And now it turns out that the British ambassador to Lebanon , Frances Guy , has written on her personal blog that Fadlallah was a man she respected and most enjoyed meeting in Lebanon .
What possesses these personalities to have blogapops all over the place I have no idea .
But Ms Guy has incurred the anger of the Israeli foreign ministry , whose spokesman says it would be " interesting " to know what the British Foreign Office thinks of her remarks .
Personally , I would be far more " interested " in what the Israeli foreign ministry knows of the British passports its government forged in order to murder a man in Dubai not many months ago .
But it just goes to show that Fadlallah – who was also a poet – can get people 's backs up , even in death .
When my friend and colleague Terry Anderson was kidnapped in Beirut – at almost seven years underground , he qualified as the longest - held hostage – I went to see Fadlallah , whom Anderson had himself recently interviewed .
" He was in my home and he was under my protection , " he said to me .
" I regard him as my friend . "
This remark might have been what kept Terry alive : by extraordinary chance , Terry was back in Beirut this week with a party of students , although I always wondered if his visit to the southern suburbs of the city was what got him nobbled .
In those days , we journos called Fadlallah Hizbollah's " spiritual mentor " , though that was n't true .
He did support the Lebanese resistance during Israel 's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and he was a fierce opponent of US policy in the region – like almost everyone else in the world , including the US , it seems – and he demanded an end of Shia blood - shedding ceremonies at Ashura ( when Shias mourn the killing of the Prophet 's grandson ) .
I went to see Fadlallah again with kidnapping much on my mind .
I was heading off to Baghdad and sought his guidance on how to avoid being abducted .
He listened kindly to me and announced that I should see a close Shia Muslim religious friend of his in the Iraqi capital .
This I did .
And was escorted to Najaf and Karbala by an associate of the friend who sat in his religious clothes in the front of the car , reading the Koran all the way .
" I was very worried for you , " Fadlallah 's friend said when I returned .
So now you tell me , I exclaimed .
But there was a further reason for Fadlallah 's help .
For every hour I was in the Iraqi holy cities , I had to meet a Shia clergyman , each of them former students of Fadlallah .
And each of them would hand me a vast pile of writings and documents – their accumulated sermons over the past 10 or 15 years .
To each I promised to pass their papers to Fadlallah .
And thus it was that , a month later , a suspicious - looking Fisk turned up in the southern suburbs of Beirut with two massive suitcases .
Fadlallah greeted me with a huge smile .
He knew what the bags contained .
Fisk had been a courier for more jurisprudence than he could imagine .
And Fadlallah knew what his colleagues in Najaf and Karbala were talking about .
Shot Pc David Rathband ' bears no malice ' to Raoul Moat
Fugitive gunman Raoul Moat has died after shooting himself following a six - hour stand - off with armed officers , say police .
The incident , in the Northumberland town of Rothbury , came after a week - long manhunt for Moat .
The 37 - year - old was wanted over the shooting of his ex-girlfriend , her new partner - who was killed - and a police officer .
The final events unfolded over more than a day of intense police activity :
1326 BST : Police involved in the stand - off with Moat fired two Taser stun guns at him , the Independent Police Complaints Commission reveals .
Northumbria Police Temporary Chief Constable Sue Sim later says " officers discharged Taser " while " striving to persuade Moat to give himself up peacefully " .
0443 BST : Northumbria Police confirm
Moat died in hospital after shooting himself and was pronounced dead at 0220 BST .
0313 BST : Police sources tell the BBC Moat is dead .
0218 BST : Northumbria Police confirm that " no shots were fired by police officers " and " it appears the suspect shot himself " .
0155 BST : An ambulance , accompanied by two police cars , is seen speeding away from Rothbury .
The convoy later arrives at Newcastle General Hospital .
0137 BST : Eyewitness Peter Abiston , whose house overlooks the scene , says he believes the man shot himself .
0121 BST : BBC producer Claire Kendall reports hearing two shots coming from the riverside area .
Paramedics are seen arriving .
0109 BST : Night vision cameras reveal a number of armed officers with their weapons trained on the man believed to be Moat .
Rain is now falling heavily in Rothbury .
0034 BST : The grandmother of Samantha Stobbart , Moat 's former girlfriend and one of his alleged shooting victims , says she 's surprised at what has happened .
Agnes Hornsby told the BBC : " I thought he would come out shooting so they would shoot him .
I just did n't think he would want to go back to prison . "
0019 BST Saturday , 10 July : Susan Ballantyne , who lives near the scene , said police officers entered her home and told her to get back from the windows .
" A lot of marksmen came through the house from the back entrance , " she added .
2359 BST : About 100 wedding guests are stuck inside the Coquetvale Hotel , about 200 yards from the scene of the stand - off , after being told by police they cannot leave .
Hotel manager Chris Greaves told the BBC the situation was " surreal " : " On one side knowing this incident is going on , on the other listening to a DJ doing party games .
There are some people going outside , but we are trying to keep people inside .
For example , this evening they were having a hog roast , which had to decamp to the inside . "
2345 BST : The BBC's Daniel Sandford says he 's been told by a relative of Samantha Stobbart - Moat 's ex-partner whom he is accused of shooting - that she has received a phone call from the police confirming that the man on the riverbank is Raoul Moat .

2330 BST : One police officer guarding the cordon tells the Press Association : " There 's a professional police negotiator from Northumbria Police down there speaking to him .
The negotiator was part of the search teams .
Giving him a drink of water is standard practice .
Putting the search lights on him is for our benefit . "
The officer adds : " This could go on all night .
So long as he's a danger only to himself they 'll be happy for it to take as long as it takes . "
2319 BST : The BBC's Danny Savage says he 's spoken to people who are convinced they saw Moat in the centre of Rothbury on Thursday night .
Those reported sightings led to a police helicopter hovering over the town for four hours , during the small hours , in the hope of spotting him .
Our correspondent says the helicopter is now hanging back , away from the town , in case the incessant noise from its rotors stresses out the man on the riverbank and causes him to do anything rash .
2256 BST : Eyewitness Susan Ballantyne tells the Press Association what she can see from her upstairs window : " They have trained two spotlights on him .
I think he is talking to the police , but he 's too far away for me to hear what he is saying .
Watching this going on , it 's not frightening but Rothbury is such a lovely place , we do n't want it to be known for something macabre .
I hope it ends well and there is no more bloodshed . "
2248 BST : Rothbury councillor Steven Bridgett tells the BBC the man is sitting " less than five metres away from a tunnel that runs under the village " .
He says all the locals know about it - many played in it as children - and it is big enough for a person to hide in .
2240 BST : The BBC's Daniel Sandford says the police will be in no hurry now - as they see it , they have the situation under control and resolving it will take as long as it needs to .
Our correspondent says that although that could take some hours yet , this extraordinary series of events is nearing its end .
2230 BST : BBC Newcastle reporter Helen Richardson says Northumberland Fire and Rescue are sending lighting equipment to Rothbury to allow officers involved in the stand - off to see clearly as night falls .
2222 BST : The BBC's Fiona Trott says former footballer Paul Gascoigne appeared a short while ago at the police cordon .
She says he posed for some pictures with children before driving off .
2215 BST : One eyewitness , Billy , tells the BBC that he saw the man on the riverbank as he was out walking .
" We turned away when my partner realised it might be Mr Moat and about five seconds after that two police vehicles came on to the scene .
Armed officers exited the vehicles , told Mr Moat to lower the weapon , which he refused to do , but he did kneel down and point the weapon at his head .
The officers then quite sensibly stood back pointing their weapons at Mr Moat , until they received back - up from other officers .
Since then , Mr Moat has remained kneeling , pointing the weapon at his head , whilst a group of about 10 police officers have been negotiating with him . "

2205 BST : Unconfirmed reports suggest a friend of Moat 's has been brought into the police cordon .
Former firearms officer Andy Redhead tells the BBC about the thinking behind such a strategy : " They 'll want that person to say , ' Listen , do what the police are saying , put down the gun .
It 's over .
Do n't do anything daft .
Nobody wants to see anyone else get hurt . ' "
2152 BST : The BBC's Fiona Trott , in Rothbury , says there are unconfirmed reports that a friend of Moat has been escorted into the police cordon .
2135 BST : One witness Lee , says his mother - in - law Kathleen is inside the police cordon .
He tells the BBC she said it had " started off quite small " and the police came down in force " very quietly , there was n't sirens going or anything " .
" So they quietly did it , the police just went down there , and then the person who had the gun to his head started moving away around the wall , and Kathleen could not see exactly where he went , and then the police told her to get back in the house . "
2129 BST : Police have imposed an air exclusion zone on the area .
2128 BST : A witness tells the BBC's Fiona Trott a police helicopter had searched the area where the man has been found during the early hours of Friday morning .
He says most residents had previously assumed he was hiding outside the village .
2100 BST : Witnesses report seeing a man with a shotgun pointed under his neck .
Peter Abiston tells the BBC he can see the man sitting down from his window .
He tells Radio 5 Live : " The man , who looks like Moat , wearing a baseball cap and white trainers , is being confronted by about 20 police about 20 feet away from him .
He 's sitting with his back to the river , facing the police and has what looks like a shotgun under his head .
" Police are behind shields or police Land Rovers or lying prone with the weapons trained on him . "
2000 BST : Northumbria Police say a man who fits the description of Moat has been located in the riverbank area in Rothbury .
They are currently negotiating with him .
An ambulance crew is on the scene .
1927 BST : Local people in the Rothbury area are advised by police to stay inside for safety while a major operation takes place .
1230 BST : Three mobile phones used by Moat are recovered by police .

It ’s always funny to see things from other countries , especially Asia where things are pretty different from here .
Take a look , there ’s plenty of funny stuff in there …

The average age at which children are diagnosed with autism is between three and four , but scientists have long suspected that the disorder starts much earlier .
A key piece of evidence is a phenomenon known as brain overgrowth .
Autistic toddlers tend to have large brains for their age , and researchers have shown a correlation between the degree of excess growth and the severity of autism symptoms .
Eric Courchesne , director of the Autism Center of Excellence at the University of California , San Diego , helped to pioneer the overgrowth hypothesis .
Now he and his colleague Cynthia Schumann have published data that suggest the excess brain growth starts in the first year of life , if not sooner .
The study , published in a recent issue of the Journal of Neuroscience , is the first to evaluate brain growth and autism throughout early development .
Using cross-sectional MRI scans , the U.C.S.D. researchers found overgrowth in autistic subjects as young as one and a half .
At two and a half , the autistic subjects ’ brains were 7 percent larger on average than the control group ’s .
Al­though why , exactly , excessive brain growth is related to autism remains a mystery , the new work helps to confirm that signs of the disorder appear early — knowledge that could lead to detection and treatments , such as behavior therapy , at a younger age .
“ The earlier the intervention , the better the outcome , ” Courchesne says .
The North Korean football team has taken off its veil , " wrote the Seoul media after their northern neighbours drew 2 - 2 with Greece in a World Cup warm - up in Switzerland on Tuesday .
For the next few weeks the face that is revealed to the world , at least as far as football fans are concerned , will for a change not be that of a short , bespectacled dictator .
The Dear Leader , Kim Jong-il , will be upstaged by " the People 's Rooney " , Jong Tae-se , a steely - eyed footballer full of passion , ambition , power and not a little humour : a popular goalscorer who , if he has his way , will soon be playing in the Premier League .
Jong is already a star in east Asia .
He took the 2008 East Asian Championship by storm in China ; is one of the top strikers in Japan 's J - League ; has appeared in television adverts alongside Manchester United 's Park Ji-sung in South Korea ; and , most unusually in the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , where supporters do little more than clap at football matches , has had his name chanted by 80,000 fans at Kim Il - sung Stadium in Pyongyang .
Now he is ready to take on the world .
Jong 's two sumptuous strikes against Greece – the first a 25 - yard shot that crashed in off the bar , the second a fierce strike from a tight angle after a burst of acceleration past a defender – may even have caused a few frowns in the training camps of World Cup Group G opponents Brazil , Ivory Coast and Portugal .
Over green tea in the ground floor restaurant in the Kanagawa Science Park , a hotel in Kawasaki just outside Tokyo where Jong plays his club football , it is hard to stop the 26 - year - old talking .
In his deep , rich voice , he announces : " I want to score a goal a game at the World Cup , one goal a game , that is my target . "
And then ?
" I want to play in England . "
It would complete an unusual journey .
Jong was born , raised and still lives in Japan .
There were reports in Seoul that his parents were South Korean but the player denies that this is the case and he appeared on the cover of South Korea 's FourFourTwo magazine in 2008 above the headline : " I am not South Korean " .
Once he entered the pro-northern education system that operates in Japan 's large Korean community , there was only one team he was going to play for .
" I was born as a North Korean and went to a North Korean school just like many people in Japan do and many of my friends did .
My mother is from North Korea .
My father was brought up in Japan and went to a Japanese school but despite that he thought of himself as North Korean and I do , too . "
Midfielder Ahn Yong - hak is another Japan - based North Korea international .
Such players , who earn about £ 4,000 a week , go to Pyongyang on football - related visits only .
Their team - mates earn a minimal state allowance and play for clubs such as the army outfit 25 April and Amroggang , one that has produced seven " heroes of the republic " in athletics and football .
There is no professional football north of the 38th parallel , where matches draw sparse crowds .
There are no divides in the DPRK dressing room , however .
" I am not the first North Korean player to be based in Japan and the other players have always been really nice to me .
They just wanted to know information about Japan and the J - League …
It was really impressive the way the players welcomed me and the way the North Korean government and people treated me . "
Politics is the one issue that Jong will not talk about , on or off the record .
Another no -no , though he enthused about it when the recorder was switched off , was the trial he undertook at a Premier League club earlier this year .
He will not name the club , but says he realised he was not quite good enough .
He believes he can improve , however , and at the World Cup millions of fans around the world will get to see for themselves as he has the chance to compare himself to the best around .
He has been nicknamed Inminui Rooney – the People 's Rooney – because of his aggressive and hard - working style and stocky build , but he thinks that it is not the best moniker .
" I do n't dislike being compared to Rooney , he is one of the greatest strikers in the world so it is a big honour , but my style of play is different to his .
My benchmark is Didier Drogba .
" I want to play in England .
When I was at high school , Italy 's Serie A was the most popular league but with the help of cable television , I started watching English football and I really enjoyed the stadiums , the atmosphere and the passion .
Years ago , I used to train wearing a Blackburn Rovers shirt . "
Was this a common sight ?
" I do n't think so , " he says , laughing .
" In Japan , there were not many people wearing Blackburn shirts .
I just went to the shop and bought one because I liked it . "
He may get close to the real thing after the summer .
The last North Koreans to play in England famously defeated Italy on their way to a thrilling quarter - final with Portugal in the 1966 World Cup , in which the Asians took a 3 - 0 lead before losing 5 - 3 .
" We know the history of course , " Jong says .
" It will be tough to repeat it but we will give everything .
Our technique is not better than the likes of South Korea and Japan but in terms of mentality and physicality , we are better than any other in Asia .
Nobody really expects us to do much at the World Cup and there will be little criticism even if we lose all the games .
If we win , that will be beyond our wildest dreams . "
Despite the presence of Drogba in the Ivory Coast team , Jong is more excited about the opening game on 15 June .
" I am looking forward to facing all three teams , especially Brazil with their history and football tradition .
It will be a great experience to play such a team . "
It will be a far cry from the 2007 preliminary qualifier against Mongolia – the first step on a long road to South Africa .
Later came four games against South Korea .
When the two teams lined up before an emotional match in Shanghai ( the match was moved from Pyongyang as North Korea refused to fly the southern flag or play their anthem ) tears rolled down the striker 's cheek .
On the back of a solid defence and a quick counterattack , North Korea finished second in a tough final group containing Saudi Arabia , Iran , the United Arab Emirates and South Korea .
" We never really thought about qualification before the final round but game by game we improved a lot and we were able to stop our opponents from playing to their strengths , " Jong says .
" I was very happy as qualification progressed because my team - mates were getting better and better . "
Claiming the runners - up spot was a tense affair .
By the final day , South Korea had already won the group and were taking on Iran in Seoul .
An away win would have left North Korea needing a victory in Saudi Arabia .
That was on the cards as Iran were leading until Park equalised with nine minutes remaining .
It meant that , thousands of miles to the west and a few hours later , North Korea needed only a draw in Riyadh .
Jong watched the Seoul match in his hotel room in the Saudi capital as he tried to relax before the game .
" Park Ji-sung gave us the best - ever assist .
He gave us a great chance .
It was so exciting .
I was with Ahn Yong - hak and we were hugging each other and jumping up and down when Park Ji-sung scored .
We knew that we only needed a draw and I had faith that we could do the job in Saudi Arabia .
We play defensively and I knew that few strikers can easily penetrate our defence . "
They held out for a goalless draw .
" At the final whistle , I was so happy and so excited .
I cried for a long time .
When we went back to our hotel , we intended to go out for a drink and have a good time but all of us were really tired .
We just had dinner and went to bed .
" Many of the team went back to Pyongyang and had a great reception .
I could n't go but as you can imagine as North Korea has n't qualified for the World Cup since 1966 then everyone there was so happy when we qualified , so excited . "
It was a triumph for the coach , Kim Jong - hun .
Little is known about him , other than that he is gruff , likes to wear trenchcoats , and does not take kindly to journalists who refer to his team as North Korea rather than DPRK .
His players speak highly of him but the team 's biggest problem , like the coach 's , is a lack of international experience .
In the past , friendlies have been as few and far between as visitors to Pyongyang .
Nigeria were due to go there in April but backed out when it became apparent that they were expected to bear the costs themselves .
The team have not been idle , however , and at least from a football perspective , North Korea are internationalising at breakneck speed with trips to Africa , South America and Europe in recent months .
It has not all gone smoothly .
A game with Chile was cancelled because of an earthquake in the South American country in February , a game in China was scrapped after food poisoning , and a training camp in Zimbabwe was called off after locals protested about Korea 's planned visit because , back in the early 1980s , North Korea helped to train a Zimbabwean army brigade that slaughtered at least 20,000 Ndebele people in the part of the country where the team were due to train .
There is still support from elsewhere , however .
Few fans , if any , from the nation itself are expected to go to South Africa but a number from the Korean community in Japan will travel and the Beijing office of the North Korean Sports Committee has given 1,000 tickets to Chinese fans .
There is also a Beijing - based international fan group , DPR Korea Football Supporters Association , organised by two Englishmen , who will send 300 fans to cheer the team from all over the world .
With South Korea sending just a few hundred Red Devils , due to the cost , distance and fears about security – widely reported in east Asia – the North could actually be better supported than their neighbours .
But Jong hopes that the 2002 semi-finalists perform well in South Africa and he even has a regular column that appears in the Seoul media .
It still continues despite the increase in tension between the two countries .
On 24 May , South Korea publicly accused Pyongyang of having sunk the Cheonan , a navy corvette , in the Yellow Sea in March .
Forty - six young sailors lost their lives .
The chairman of South Korea 's bid to host the 2022 World Cup , Han Sung - joo , a former foreign minister , remains keen to have North Korea involved in the tournament if possible .
Jong certainly hopes that it is .
" If the World Cup comes to Pyongyang it would be beyond our wildest dreams .
The people are already excited about the World Cup in South Africa , having a World Cup on home soil would be something else .
It was impressive watching South Korea reach the last four back in 2002 and if North Korea has home advantage then we could perform well also .
" It may not be easy politically to be united but sport can unite people .
If there are games in South Korea and North Korea , then that can contribute to peace on the Korean peninsula . "

Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell was published in 2004 .
When I first read it in February 2005 I wrote a review on my Livejournal ( full review here ) , which I shall quote from because it is still my substantive reaction :
It ’s set at the beginning of the nineteenth century , in an England that is the same but distorted by the operation of magic on history , and it concerns the bringing back of practical English magic .
What it ’s about is the tension between the numinous and the known .
The helical plot , which ascends slowly upwards , constantly circles a space in which the numinous and the known balance and shift and elements move between them .
It ’s a truly astonishing feat and I ’ve never seen anything like it .
I ’ve just read it again , and I could pretty much write that post again .
In summary — this is terrific , it reads like something written in an alternate history in which Lud in the Mist was the significant book of twentieth century fantasy , and it goes directly at the the movement between magical and the mundane .
I was n’t the only person to think this book was brilliant .
It won the World Fantasy Award , it won the Hugo and the Mythopoeic , it was Time Magazine ’s number one book of the year , a New York Times notable book , it was in the top ten of almost every publication in Britain and the U.S. and it was a huge international mega - bestseller .
It did about as well as any book can do .
But five years later , it does n’t seem to have had any impact .
Sandcastle fantasy is being published all around as if Clarke had never put finger to keyboard .
I wonder why that is ?
It may be that it ’s just too soon .
Publishing is astonishingly slow .
Books being published now were written several years ago .
Influence does take time to permeate through .
But would n’t you think that in five years you ’d start to see some influence ?
But even without publishing speed , it could take longer than that for Clarke ’s influence to be assimilated and reacted to .
I should n’t be so impatient .
Ten years might be a better measure .
Or maybe it will take a generation , maybe the people who read Clarke when they were teenagers will grow up to write fantasy influenced by her , but it ’s not going to happen with people already grown up and publishing and set in their ways ?
Perhaps it ’s just sui generis , so wonderful and unique that it can’t really be an influence except as a spur to excellence ?
Or maybe , in the same way it does n’t appear to have a much in the way of immediate ancestors , it ca n’t produce descendants ?
It ’s wonderful , but it ’s not what fantasy is , it is n’t in dialogue with fantasy and it ’s hard for fantasy to engage with it ?
After all , what do I mean by influence ?
There ’s plenty of fantasy set in Regency England — there ’s Novik ’s Temeraire for a start .
I do n’t think we should have a sudden rash of books about Napoleonic magic or books with charming footnotes containing short stories .
I do n’t even want more books directly using faerie magic .
( We have had some of those too . )
What I would have thought I ’d have seen by now is stories that acknowledge the shadow Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell cast across the possibilities , things that attempt to engage with the numinous in the way it does .
Fantasy is all about ways of approaching the numinous — and everything I read is still using the traditional approaches .
That ’s what I keep hoping for and not seeing .
Perhaps it will happen , given time .
Meanwhile , Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is there , it ’s incredible , and one can always read it again .
Jo Walton is a science fiction and fantasy writer .
She ’s published eight novels , most recently Half a Crown and Lifelode , and two poetry collections .
She reads a lot , and blogs about it here regularly .
She comes from Wales but lives in Montreal where the food and books are more varied .
Ballmer ’s comments come just weeks after Microsoft shelved plans for a flagship , dual - screen tablet - style computer called the Courier .
A special team within the company had been working on the secret prototype , but Microsoft announced that it would not be continuing with the Courier project , saying that it was just one of many ideas it was investigating , and that it had “ no plans ” to build the device at that time .
U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the spring , stoking concerns about a weak job market , a drawn - out struggle for the unemployed and growing financial pressures on millions of American families .
FOR THE RECORD :
Personal savings :
An article in Saturday ’s Section A about slowing economic growth in the United States said the personal savings rate of 6.2 % in the second quarter was the highest since early 1993 .
Newly revised data from the Commerce Department show that rate was the highest since the second quarter of 2009 . —
The nation ’s gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.4 % in the second quarter , falling from an upwardly revised 3.7 % expansion in the first three months of the year , the Commerce Department said Friday .
While many economists had expected growth to moderate , the reported decline was a jolting 35 % below the previous quarter .
Gross domestic product is the value of all goods and services produced in the economy .
Underlying the government ’s report was an unusual economic crosscurrent : Corporate America is flourishing , investing heavily on new computers and other equipment .
Meanwhile , many consumers are cutting their spending as they try to pare debts in the face of weak income gains , high unemployment and a shaky housing market .
“ The consumer is still very tepid , but businesses are humming along , ” said Shawn DuBravac , chief economist for the Consumer Electronics Assn. , referring generally to large companies .
“ But this disconnect , ” he added , “ can only happen for a finite period of time . ”
In other words , if consumers do n’t step up their spending — which accounts for 70 % of the American economy — businesses wo n’t be investing much more for very long .
“ It ’s difficult to have a strong sustained recovery without households coming to the party , ” said Paul Ashworth , senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto .
Consumer spending rose a meager 1.6 % in the second quarter , down from 1.9 % in the first three months of the year , according to the Commerce Department .
The nation ’s large trade deficit was another major factor in the latest GDP slowdown .
“ It ’s not very promising , ” said Mark Vitner , a senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte , N.C. Like other analysts , he sees slower growth ahead as government stimulus spending fades and companies reduce the rate at which they had been rebuilding their inventories .
Some technology companies already have reported that they have plenty of merchandise on hand and wo n’t be restocking until consumers spend more freely , Vitner and others said .
In the wake of Friday ’s report , a number of economists downgraded their growth forecast for the second half of the year to as low as 1.5 % , an anemic rate that would likely push the unemployment rate above June ’s 9.5 % figure .
Commerce officials also revised downward some prior growth figures for real GDP , which is the inflation - adjusted value of all goods and services produced in the U.S .
The government Friday said real GDP grew 5 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 , down from a previously reported 5.6 % .
Overall , the new data painted a picture of a deeper recession than previously believed .
Government spending and inventory adjustments have powered the economic recovery that began last summer , and they juiced up the second quarter as well .
But economists expect tighter public spending , particularly by budget - strapped state and local governments , to be a drag on the economy in the coming quarters .
Many private economists projected that the unemployment rate would rise to 9.8 % or higher by the end of the year .
That ’s not because they think job growth will turn negative .
Rather , it ’s because the economy needs to create about 125,000 jobs a month just to keep pace with the natural increase in the working - age , and at the current rate of GDP growth , employers will be hard pressed to generate much more than that .
July ’s jobless rate will be reported next Friday .
“ When somebody hires a worker or buys a new piece of equipment , they ’re taking a risk - reward calculation , ” Vitner said .
“ And in a slow - growth environment , the rewards are n’t that high . ”
Lynn Reaser , president of the National Assn. for Business Economics , said that many companies , especially smaller ones , remained reluctant to add workers because of weak private demand , tight credit and uncertainties about the outlook and government policies .
The association ’s latest survey shows hiring prospects improved but still sluggish .
“ There ’s just a lot of angst about the future strength of the economy , the deficits and what the tax structure will look like , ” said Reaser , an economist at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego .
“ The real question now relates to confidence .
… Will businesses stay at the table , and will consumers at last play some part in this recovery ? ”
Reaser and others said the good news was that the European debt crisis , which rattled financial markets , had eased and that business investment remained very strong .
Indeed , in the second quarter , the Commerce report showed , companies ’ investments rocketed 19.1 % from the first quarter .
That included a turnaround in outlays for buildings and a nearly 22 % jump in spending for equipment and software .
But retail sales have softened and consumer attitudes have soured .
On Friday , the University of Michigan reported that its index of consumer sentiment fell in July to its lowest level since last November .
But Ashworth said the latest report also offered some hopeful signs .
He noted that a surge in U.S .
imports had a large negative effect on the overall GDP rate , which he sees as a
volatile component of the GDP calculations .
Moreover , he and others said , although personal spending remains weak , many consumers are socking away more money .
While that may be harmful to the broader economy in the short run — the so - called paradox of thrift — it will help families improve their financial situations in the longer term .
Friday ’s report showed consumers saved an upwardly revised 5.5 % of their after - tax income in the first three months of this year , and the personal savings rate rose to 6.2 % in the second quarter , the highest since early 1993 .
That savings rate means more consumers will be in a stronger position to make purchases as the slow recovery continues , said Alan Levenson , chief economist at mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price in Baltimore .
“ That ’s close to where we thought consumers needed to be to take them along in consumption , ” he said .

It would be a mitzvah if somebody took :
and :
and cut-and - pasted them into a Niall Ferguson vs Niall Ferguson debate ...
UPDATE : Matthew Yglesias and Ryan McNealy have answered the call : http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/07/niall-ferguson-debates-himself/.
Now that 's what I call message coordination !
In the recent years , programming language design has gone through a renaissance primarily due to two factors : ( 1 ) Multicores became standard in consumer PCs .
This brings more attention to concurrent programming .
( 2 ) Dynamic languages are fast enough to implement internet services and outgrow the demeaning term " scripting language " .
With this article , I try to collect the most important mistakes that every serious programming language designer should avoid .
I will ignore opinionated questions like dynamic vs static typing .
Also , I will omit mistakes that can be fixed without major pain .
For example , adding parametric types later on seems to be possible .
Sun added Generics to Java eight years after the 1.0 release .
As a recent example the Google Go Language Design FAQ states : " Generics may well be added at some point .
We do n't feel an urgency for them , although we understand some programmers do . "
0. Null pointers
A reference to an object may be a null pointer in all popular languages , which leads to runtime errors .
C.A.R .
Hoare recently took on responsibility for this " invention " , though a lot of other designers are to blame as well .
I call it my billion - dollar mistake .
It was the invention of the null reference in 1965 . [...]
More recent programming languages like Spec# have introduced declarations for non-null references .
This is the solution , which I rejected in 1965 .
- C.A.R. Hoare
Languages like C/C++ just crash with a segmentation fault on dereferencing a null pointer .
Java , Python and other languages throw a NullPointerException , but the problem is that this RuntimeException may be thrown at nearly every statement .
A static type system can be used to declare references , which are guaranteed not to be null .
For example Cyclone is a safe C variant , which introduces a not - null pointer and restricts pointer arithmetic .
Some languages even make it impossible to create a null pointer , though this makes explicit pointer arithmetic impossible .
Haskell for example provides the Maybe monad instead , which forces the programmer to consider the " null case " .
1. Parser - unfriendly syntax
The grammar of a programming language should be LALR or even better LL ( 1 ) .
Todays programmers want proper tool support for their language , which means multiple IDEs , editors and other tools have to parse a programming language .
There wo n't be a single frontend .
Probably multiple compiler implementations are created .
This development should be made as easy as possible .
The prominent counter example is C++ , which is nearly impossible to parse correctly .
The syntax overhead is neglible and the programmer enjoys faster compilation times in return .
2. Unclear semantics
Do n't say " implementation specific " in a language specification !
Use " undefined " as rare as possible !
The gold standard is StandardML , with a completely formalized semantic .
C is a counter example with many edge cases unspecified .
However , due to its widespread use some behaviour is defined by community consensus .
For example it is unspecified what happens on an integer overflow .
This means a compiler could correctly deduce x < x +1 to be always true ( maybe a whole loop could be optimized away in effect ) .
Unfortunately a lot of C code uses a comparison like that to check , wether an overflow happened , and expects that an overflow behaves like on a x86 processor ( e.g. maxint + 1 == minint ) .
Clear semantics make verification and error checking easier .
Software verification is coming slowly , but surely .
I envision a big chance for languages which make verification easy in a decade or two , which is roughly the time a successful language started today will reach the mainstream .
3. Bad Unicode support
This mostly is about strings within the code , but do not forget that not everybody names his functions in english .
The programmer should be able to use Unicode , so the source file must declare its encoding .
The conversion and differentiation between a text and a byte stream is more an issue of the standard library than of the language , but of course this influences the syntax as well .
Read how Python 3 fixed this .
4. Preprocessor
While preprocessors like cpp and m4 are in widespread use , they are a quick hack instead of a clean solution .
They are used to include external files ( without the possibility for proper module mechanisms ) , enable conditional compilation , and macro substitution ( enabling subtle bugs , because of scoping , syntax etc ) .
Integrating these features into the programming languages can improve performance and error checking , but does have no downsides .
A particular bad use of a preprocessor is the module system .
C suffers from #include and C++ creates even more pain , since templates require big parts of a program to be in header files and included into every other file .
With a real module system the extern keyword would not be needed and linking would be much faster .

This list is not comprehensive and i plan to extend it .
Please , tell me what i have forgotten !

An Android shirt Calvin can be proud of
I bet no matter where you live you have run across one of those stickers on someone ’s car that shows Calvin from Calvin and Hobbs taking a leak on something .
These are the stickers that serious fans of one thing or another like to stick on the back window of their car in my area .
If you are a hardcore Android fan or just hate Apple , the perfect shirt for you has surfaced .
The shirt has the green Android mascot taking a leak on an apple with a bite out of it .
That apple looks a whole lot like the logo from the back of the iPhone .
The shirt is on French site t12lve Creations and is called Andromod .
It sells for € 27.00 and I have no idea if the company will ship to the US .
Shum Khan , a man both deaf and unable to speak , lived in the remote border hamlet of Malekshay , 7,000 ft up in the mountains .
When a heavily armed squad from the CIA barrelled into his village in March 2007 , the war logs record that he " ran at the sight of the approaching coalition forces … out of fear and confusion " .
The secret CIA paramilitaries , ( the euphemism here is OGA , for " other government agency " ) shouted at him to stop .
Khan could not hear them .
He carried on running .
So they shot him , saying they were entitled to do so under the carefully graded " escalation of force " provisions of the US rules of engagement .
Khan was wounded but survived .
The Americans ' error was explained to them by village elders , so they fetched out what they term " solatia " , or compensation .
The classified intelligence report ends briskly : " Solatia was made in the form of supplies and the Element mission progressed " .
Behind the military jargon , the war logs are littered with accounts of civilian tragedies .
The 144 entries in the logs recording some of these so - called " blue on white " events , cover a wide spectrum of day - by - day assaults on Afghans , with hundreds of casualties .
They range from the shootings of individual innocents to the often massive loss of life from air strikes , which eventually led President Hamid Karzai to protest publicly that the US was treating Afghan lives as " cheap " .
When civilian family members are actually killed in Afghanistan , their relatives do , in fairness , get greater solatia payments than cans of beans and Hershey bars .
The logs refer to sums paid of 100,000 Afghani per corpse , equivalent to about £ 1,500 .
US and allied commanders frequently deny allegations of mass civilian casualties , claiming they are Taliban propaganda or ploys to get compensation , which are contradicted by facts known to the military .
But the logs demonstrate how much of the contemporaneous US internal reporting of air strikes is simply false .
Last September there was a major scandal at Kunduz in the north of Afghanistan when a German commander ordered the bombing of a crowd looting two hijacked fuel tankers .
The contemporaneous archive circulated to Nato allies records him authorising the airstrike by a US F - 15 jet " after ensuring that no civilians were in the vicinity " .
The " battle damage assessment " confirmed , it claims , that 56 purely " enemy insurgents " had died .
Media reports followed by official inquiries , however , established something closer to the real death toll .
It included 30 to 70 civilians .
In another case the logs show that on the night of 30 August 2008 , a US special forces squad called Scorpion 26 blasted Helmand positions with multiple rockets , and called in an airstrike to drop a 500 lb bomb .
All that was officially logged was that 24 Taliban had been killed .
But writer Patrick Bishop was embedded in the valley nearby with British paratroops at their Sangin bases .
He recorded independently : " Overnight , the question of civilian casualties took on an extra urgency .
An American team had been inserted on to Black Mountain … From there , they launched a series of offensive operations .
On 30 August , wounded civilians , some of them badly injured , turned up at Sangin and FOB Inkerman saying they had been attacked by foreign troops .
Such incidents gave a hollow ring to ISAF claims that their presence would bring security to the local population . "
Some of the more notorious civilian calamities did become public at the time .
The logs confirm that an entirely truthful official announcement was made regretting the guidance system failure of one " smart bomb " .
On 9 September 2008 it unintentionally landed on a village causing 26 civilian casualties .
The US also realised very quickly that a Polish squad had committed what appeared to have been a possible war crime .
On 16 August 2007 the Poles mortared a wedding party in the village of Nangar Khel in an apparent revenge attack shortly after experiencing an IED explosion .
It is recorded under the heading : " Any incident that may cause negative media " .
The report disclosed that three women victims had " numerous shrapnel wounds …
One was pregnant and an emergency C- section was performed but the baby died " .
In all , six were killed .
The Polish troops were shipped home and some eventually put on trial for the atrocity .
After protests in their support from a Polish general , the trial has apparently so far failed to reach a conclusion .
But most of the assaults on civilians recorded here , do not appear to have been investigated .
French troops " opened fire on a bus that came too close to convoy " near the village of Tangi Kalay outside Kabul on 2 October 2008 , according to the logs .
They wounded eight children who were in the bus .
Two months later , US troops gunned down a group of bus passengers even more peremptorily , as the logs record .
Patrolling on foot , a Kentucky - based squad from 1st Battalion , 506th Infantry Regiment , known as " Red Currahee " , decided to flag down the approaching bus , so their patrol could cross the road .
Before sunrise , a soldier stepped out on to Afghanistan 's main highway and raised both hands in the air .
When the bus failed to slow – travellers are often wary of being flagged down in Afghanistan 's bandit lands – a trooper raked it with machine - gun fire .
They killed four passengers and wounded 11 others .
Some of the civilian deaths in the list stem from violent actions by US special forces attempting to hunt down Taliban leaders or al - Qaida incomers .
In a typical case , last November , the army files record a demonstration by 80 angry villagers who broke an armoured car window in the village of Lewani .
A woman from the village had been killed in an assault by the shadowy Task Force 373 .
The influence of the then new commander , General Stanley McChrystal , can be seen , however .
Brought in last year with a mission to try to cut the number of civilian casualties , he clearly demanded more detailed reporting of such incidents .
The Lewani file is marked with a new " information requirement " to record each " credible allegation of Isaf [ the occupying forces ] … causing non-combatant injury / death " .
McChrystal was replaced last month , however , by General David Petraeus , amid reports that restraints aimed at cutting civilian deaths would be loosened once again .
The bulk of the " blue - white " file consists of a relentless catalogue of civilian shootings on nearly 100 occasions by jumpy troops at checkpoints , near bases or on convoys .
Unco-operative drivers and motorcyclists are frequent targets .
Each incident almost without exception is described as a meticulous " escalation of force " conducted strictly by the book , against a threatening vehicle .
US and UK rules require shouts , waves , flares , warning shots and shots into the engine block , before using lethal force .
Each time it is claimed that this procedure is followed .
Yet " warning shots " often seem to cause death or injury , generally ascribed to ricochets .
Sometimes , it seems as though civilian drivers merely failed to get off the road fast enough .
On 9 July 2006 mechanic Mohamad Baluch was test - driving a car in Ghazni , when the Americans rolled into town on an anti-IED " route clearance patrol " .
The log records : " LN [ local national ] vehicle did not yield to US convoy …
Gunner on lead truck shot into the vehicle and convoy kept going out of the area . "
The townspeople threw rocks at the eight departing armoured Humvees .
Baluch ended up in hospital with machine - gun bullets in his shoulder .

Here are 27 Breathtaking Nature Photos That Refresh Your Mind
Lately , my content on this blog has sucked donkey balls .
By “ me ” I mean Brian .
I have a flash of genius here , an epiphany there , but they ’re spread few and far between like iPhones with full bars .
In my best Austin Powers accent : “ I lost my mojo , man ” I lost my fire for blogging .
I ’ve been more interested in talking with entrepreneurs on a one to one level than in killing neurons in my readers ’ heads .
When you stop retweeting your own blog posts , deep down , you know your substance is tanking .
My shit was going down like the Titanic .
For the past handful of posts , I could n’t think of a single interesting thing to say .
The problem is , you readers are n’t content with just seeing my gorgeous mug .
You actually want substantial content !
I was Lady Gaga , minus the musical genius .
I thought about video blogging , but obviously , I ’d get too many stalkers .
That and I ’m so pale you ’d think they ’re filming the fourth installment of Twilight in my bedroom .
So how did I lose my mojo ?
I forgot the Foreplay .
Foreplay = Fun
All jokes aside , the problem was that my paradigm had shifted .
I ’d become a slave to the blog .
Some days , I would work my balls off and then have to sit down and come up with something impressive to say .
That did n’t go well .
Usually , I ’m off the cuff with some dashes of fun and pinches of wit .
I like to sprinkle it around like ruffees at a frat party .
Recently , I ’ve been dry and dull .
I had stopped the foreplay .
I had forgotten that , as the ladies say , the foreplay is the best part .
The trick is to adopt a new perspective to make writing fun again .
To do that , you have to ask yourself the right questions .
Ask The Right Questions
I finally came alive Wednesday night when reading my gf ’s blog titles .
They were hilarious and outright ridiculous .
Best of all , they had a point .
I thought to myself , “ Damn it , I ’m hilarious and ridiculous … ”
People laugh at me all the time when I ’m dancing , and that ’s before I bust out the Elaine Kick .
I realized I had been taking the wrong approach .
Writing was becoming a chore because that ’s how I viewed it .
I needed a way to make it fun again .
I exercise 5 times a week and at the end of each week , I add new songs to my playlist .
That livens up the following week ’s workouts .
I forgot to ask myself the right question : “ How can I contribute great blog posts and do so in a way where I have tons of fun ? ”
Positive Presuppositions
If you cleverly caught that I presupposed “ great blog posts ” in that last sentence then go out an buy yourself a high - carb treat .
Do n’t worry , the guilt ’s on me - you just enjoy .
Positive presuppositions are the secret .
Self - help guru Tony Robbins will tell you to ask yourself the right questions and let your brain come up with the answers .
That little voice in your head needs to start using positive presuppositions .
I used to ask , “ How can I make my five workouts a week more enjoyable . ” I got an answer .
Now I ’m asking about enjoyable blogging .
I ’m already coming up with a list :
Showcase more personality
Use more humor so it ’s fun to write Pick a fight Get inspiration by talking with others
Get ahead of the blog so I do n’t feel pressured to write something decent in a short amount of time Photoshop some of my own pics for posts headers
The Bottom Line
Your mind is a powerful thing .
No matter what you ask it , it will come up with an answer .
From good answers to “ I do n’t know ” to something totally crazy and illogical .
Ever go to bed with a problem on your mind and wake up with the answer ?
Ever have an “ Ah Ha ” moment while you were doing something completely mundane ?
That ’s your brain fool !
And it ’s putting in overtime no matter how many tequila shots you took !
Since it ’s always running in the background , take advantage of it .
Ask yourself questions with positive presuppositions .
Frame your questions in a positive and insightful manner .
How you talk to yourself gives you the chops to persevere or the excuses to give up .
Be good to yourself .
Instead of asking , “ Why did I read this terrible blog post when I ’m already tired ? ” ask , “ How can I pass this blog ’s insanely insightful message onto my friends in a fun way ? ”

When you open Rand Paul ’s web page the first thing you notice is the huge fundraising logo and counter on top .
When I looked this morning , Paul , the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Kentucky , and tea party fave , had raised $ 3.6 million or so .
Rand Paul is the son of the most famous libertarian in the country , GOP Rep .
Ron Paul of Texas .
His dad ran unsuccessfully for the 2008 GOP presidential nomination .
But the “ Paul ” brand attracted a lot of attention throughout the country in ’08 .
Ron Paul signs could be seen in an assortment of places , from antiwar demonstrations to the Internet gaming world .
The son , Rand , named after capitalism cheerleader Ayn Rand* , opposes all government intervention into capitalist society , except for one .
“ I am 100 % pro life .
I believe abortion is taking the life of an innocent human being .
I believe life begins at conception and it is the duty of our government to protect this life , ” Rand Paul says on his website .
The other things you notice on the website are the anti-Obama headlines , the constant attack on his opponent Democrat Jack Conway , Kentucky ’s attorney general , and the big deal Paul makes about being a doctor .
Paul is a doctor of ophthalmology – an eye doc .
Although he supports the federal government storm - trooping its way between a woman and her doctor when it comes to reproductive decisions , what ’s good for Petra is apparently not good for Paul .
Paul , outraged at the requirement of board certification by the nongovernment professional organization , the American Board of Ophthalmology , left the group and formed his own National Board of Ophthalmology .
Apparently , his board certified him and six other docs as qualified ophthalmologists , while the other board has certified 16,000 .
If I were going for eye surgery , I do n’t think thumbing your nose at an organized medical certification process would be at the top of my list of qualifications for a surgeon .
What is n’t as apparent on Rand Paul ’s site is his total disdain for worker rights .
Berry Craig , a professor at Western Kentucky Community and Technical College in Paducah , writes that Paul “ opposes ALL workers ’ rights . ”
Craig , a member of the American Federation of Teachers , writes on the AFL - CIO Now blog that in a candidate questionnaire , “ Paul indicated his opposition to workers ’ rights across the board . ”
According to Kentucky State AFL - CIO
President Bill Londrigan , Craig writes , the GOP ’s Paul is receiving lots of support from big business and corporations for his anti-worker stance .
Paul especially opposes a worker ’s right to organize and bargain collectively .
Corporate groups that support Paul , like the so - called Coalition to Protect Kentucky Jobs and the National Right to Work [ for less ]
Committee , are determined to prevent passage of the Employee Free Choice Act .
The EFCA seeks to restore workers ’ rights on the job , including the right to form a union , which have been badly eroded over the last decades .
Further highlighting Paul ’s class allegiances , the tea party candidate recently said President ’s Obama criticism of BP and the oil spill was “ un- American ” and that poor people in the U.S. live better than the rest of the world .
( Perhaps he was suggesting everyone should stop complaining ? )
According to a new poll from Public Policy Polling , Kentucky ’s U.S. Senate race is in a dead heat with Democrat Conway and Republican Paul each at 43 percent of the vote .
According to the pollsters ,
Paul ’s recent comments on behalf of the corporate world have hurt him in the polls .
* Note from the author : Rand Paul supporters commenting on this article charge the Republican is n’t named after Ayn Rand , so I added the source of what is really a minor part of this article .

A record attempt will be made off north Queensland this weekend for the world 's largest nude snorkel .
The event is being held in waters off Magnetic Island near Townsville with more than 500 people expected on the island .
Coordinator Barbara Gibbs says it is about raising awareness of ocean health .
" Our Magnetic Island is just like a boat in an ocean ; we 're surrounded by it and it's very important for us to look after that and not dirty our backyard , " she said .
" We need to make sure we 're not part of the problem and we need to fix up whatever problems we do have around with pollution or whatever , even these little tiny bits of plastic that the birds and the fish eat , and the plastic bags the turtles and crocodiles eat .
" This is our second World Oceans Day and this is also the second United Nations - sanctioned World Oceans Day . "

The neuroprotective compound P7C3 was discovered by testing more than 1000 small molecules in living mice .

Scientists have discovered a compound that restores the capacity to form new memories in aging rats , likely by improving the survival of newborn neurons in the brain 's memory hub .
The research , funded in part by the National Institutes of Health , has turned up clues to a neuroprotective mechanism that could lead to a treatment for Alzheimer 's disease .
" This neuroprotective compound , called P7C3 , holds special promise because of its medication - friendly properties , " explained Steven McKnight , Ph.D. , who co-led the research with Andrew Pieper , M.D. , Ph.D. , both of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas .
" It can be taken orally , crosses the blood - brain barrier with long - lasting effects , and is safely tolerated by mice during many stages of development . "
The researchers report on their findings July 9 , 2010 in the journal Cell .
Their work was funded , in part , by the NIH 's National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) , a NIH Director 's Pioneer Award funded through the Common Fund and managed by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences , and National Cancer Institute .
" This striking demonstration of a treatment that stems age - related cognitive decline in living animals points the way to potential development of the first cures that will address the core illness process in Alzheimer 's disease , " said NIMH Director Thomas Insel , M.D .
Physical activity , social , or other enriching experiences promote neurogenesis - the birth and maturation of new neurons .
This growth takes place in the dentate gyrus , a key area of the brain 's memory hub , the hippocampus .
But even in the normal adult brain , most of these newborn neurons die during the month it takes to develop and get wired into brain circuitry .
To survive , the cells must run a gauntlet of challenges .
Newborn hippocampus neurons fare much worse in aging - related disorders like Alzheimer 's , marked by runaway cell death .
In hopes of finding compounds that might protect such vulnerable neurons during this process , Pieper , McKnight and colleagues tested more than 1000 small molecules in living mice .
One of the compounds , designated P7C3 , corrected deficits in the brains of adult mice engineered to lack a gene required for the survival of newborn neurons in the hippocampus .
Giving P7C3 to the mice reduced programmed death of newborn cells - normalizing stunted growth of branch - like neuronal extensions and thickening an abnormally thin layer of cells by 40 percent .
Among clues to the mechanism by which P7C3 works , the researchers discovered that it protects the integrity of machinery for maintaining a cell 's energy level .
Aged rats treated with P7C3 performed significantly better on a memory test than control rats treated with an inactive substance ( veh ) .
This was traced to a three - fold higher number of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus .
Credit : Andrew Pieper , M.D. , Ph.D. , UT Southwestern Medical Center
To find out if P7C3 could similarly stem aging - associated neuronal death and cognitive decline , the researchers gave the compound to aged rats .
Rodents treated with P7C3 for two months significantly outperformed their placebo - treated peers on a water maze task , a standard assay of hippocampus - dependent learning .
This was traced to a threefold higher - than - normal level of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of the treated animals .
Rats were used instead of mice for this phase of the study because the genetically engineered mice could not swim .
The researchers pinpointed a derivative of P7C3 , called A20 , which is even more protective than the parent compound .
They also produced evidence suggesting that two other neuroprotective compounds eyed as possible Alzheimer 's cures may work through the same mechanism as P7C3 .
The A20 derivative proved 300 times more potent than one of these compounds currently in clinical trials for Alzheimer 's disease .
This suggested that even more potent neuroprotective agents could potentially be discovered using the same methods .
Following up on these leads , the researchers are now searching for the molecular target of P7C3 - key to discovering the underlying neuroprotective mechanism .

There are more than 500 skimmers being used
The use of a new vessel to capture oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill site has been delayed by tropical storm Alex .
The Helix producer ship was expected to be taking oil from the well by the end of June , but it will now not be working until the middle of next week .
Once the vessel is working it has been predicted BP will be capturing 53,000 barrels of oil a day .
There are also plans to use a giant tanker , refitted to scoop up oil , at the spill site .
The ship known as " A Whale " is waiting for approval to join the clean - up .

The world 's largest skimmer is one recent arrival to the Gulf
Alex , briefly classified as a hurricane before being downgraded to a tropical storm , has stopped clean - up efforts in much of the Gulf .
Small skimmer boats , in particular , have been unable to operate in choppy seas and have had to return to shore .
At the spill site the two current capture vessels have continued to work , despite the bad weather .
But the plans to connect the vessel Helix to the " kill " valve on the blowout preventer device on the top of the well have been delayed .
" We will need about three days after the weather calms ... for that vessel to be able to hook up to the flexible coupling that it would be required to do , " incident commander Thad Allen said .
The newly - retired Coast Guard admiral played down suggestions that there was a lack of transparency in the release of information about the efforts to deal with the spill .
' Debunked ' myth
There has been criticism - in a report from Republican Congressman Darrell Issa - that offers of help from outside the US are being delayed .
It has been alleged that an offer of four skimmer boats from the Dutch government on 30 April was not approved for seven weeks .
Reacting generally to the allegations of delays to foreign help , the White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs said : " That is a myth that has been debunked hundreds of times . "
Meanwhile , scientists have raised concerns that oil is entering the food chain .
Researchers from the University of Southern Mississippi and Tulane University found oil in the postlarvae of blue crabs entering coastal marshes along the Gulf Coast .
Tests are still going on to establish whether the oil is from the Deepwater Horizon spill .
On Friday afternoon , BP senior vice - president Kent Wells was trying hard to contain his elation .
The well in the Gulf of Mexico , which had been leaking oil for 88 days , was holding up .
The cap , lowered onto the well on Thursday , remained in place .
And after numerous failed attempts , the torrent of oil had finally stopped .
" It felt very good to see no oil going into the Gulf of Mexico , " Wells told reporters on the daily conference call he hosts from Houston on BP 's attempts to stop the leak .
An end appeared to be in sight to the worst environmental disaster in US history .
Shares in BP rose again on Friday as investors hoped that the company , whose value has plunged by more than a third in the wake of the disaster , was over the worst of the crisis .
But just as the oil has , for now , stopped flowing , the recriminations have already started to fly .
Next month BP is expected to report the findings of its own internal investigation into what – or who – it believes caused the disaster .
BP 's contractors are already preparing their defence if , as seems likely , the finger of blame should point to them .
Given its poor safety record in the US , BP is an easy target .
But evidence is emerging that even after a series of major accidents several years ago , safety at its US operations still leaves a lot to be desired .
Ken Abbott , a whistleblower from BP 's giant deepwater Atlantis platform in the Gulf of Mexico , alleges that operations there are " like a Wild Wild West show " .
At the centre of the legal storm now brewing over Deepwater Horizon is the blow - out preventer ( BOP ) .
A supposedly failsafe piece of equipment , it is the last line of defence to stop well blow - outs .
This one failed , with disastrous consequences .
US investigators have already subpoenaed the 450 - ton device , and when relief wells finally secure the leak , as early as next month , it will be lifted off the seabed for forensic analysis .
Cameron International , the Houston - based company that manufactured the BOP , has already been hauled before US politicians to explain itself , along with Transocean , which leased the Deepwater Horizon rig to BP .
The Observer has learnt how Cameron will try to pin the blame on BP for the failure of the BOP : lawyers will claim that BP ordered Transocean to modify the BOP in China so significantly that the remodelled component no longer resembled what Cameron had originally manufactured .
BOPs are complicated pieces of kit that cost millions of dollars , according to Mike Sawyer , an independent Houston - based oil industry engineer .
He told the Observer that it is cheaper – but not uncommon – to get equipment modifications done in countries such as China , India or South Korea rather than the US .
He added that it was vital that contractors ' work was properly monitored to make sure the oil company 's instructions were followed .
But if the BOP was found to have been modified incorrectly by a Chinese contractor , BP could be found liable for damages on its behalf .
It would be almost impossible to successfully bring a case against a company in China , where the rule of law is notoriously lax .
One industry lawyer says : " An ' empty chair ' defence – where BP blamed a Chinese contractor which could not be pursued in the courts – is unlikely to stack up . "
Cameron and BP declined to comment this weekend .
Transocean , which bought the BOP from Cameron , has already told congressional hearings that it was ordered to modify it in 2005 at BP 's expense and under its direction .
BP executives in charge of gulf drilling responded that not all the changes made had been documented , which they said had seriously hampered efforts to reactivate the BOP and stop the leak in the critical 24 hours after the explosion .
Under federal law , BP , as the operator of the project , is required to make sure that detailed and up - to - date drawings and documents are kept of the thousands of components , such as the BOP , that make up the Deepwater Horizon .
This database is supposed to act as an operating manual , and is crucial – as BP 's engineers found to their cost – if something goes wrong .
What has emerged from the congressional hearings is a picture of an oil industry allowed to run riot in the Gulf of Mexico , free of any serious supervision from regulators .
One industry safety expert says : " The Gulf of Mexico is one of the last cowboy areas in the US . "
BP had boasted two months before the Deepwater Horizon explosion that its " strength lies in operating at the frontiers of geography and technology " .
Going to such extremes in such a " cowboy area " , where BP is the biggest producer , turned out to be a lethal combination .
BP is not the only company to benefit from an almost lawless operating environment in the Gulf .
But an Observer investigation has uncovered evidence of how BP has benefited from this lack of regulation and failed to use standard procedures in its US operations , particularly offshore .
The company has a reputation with insurers in the gulf for pushing its offshore subcontractors especially hard : according to one well - placed industry source , it was unofficial policy about two years ago for the Houston offices of at least one major insurance company to refuse to process applications for companies working with the oil firm .
BP subcontractors seeking well - control insurance , for example , were seen as too high a risk and their applications were not passed on to head office .
BP was the only company unofficially blacklisted in this way in the gulf by this insurer , says the source .
The evidence given to congressional hearings so far about the events leading up to the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon explosion on 20 April seem to have confirmed the insurers ' worst fears .
The charge sheet against BP in the US is long and well documented .
Even allowing for its size , it has experienced far more than its fair share of serious accidents .
In the four most recent years for which the US government has released figures – 2005 to 2008 – there were 92 fatalities in the US oil and gas industry as a result of fires and explosions .
In 2005 , the explosion at BP's Texas City refinery alone killed 14 workers , while 11 died when the Deepwater Horizon exploded this year .
Again in 2005 , its $ 1bn deepwater platform Thunder Horse almost sank in the Gulf of Mexico because of a technical fault .
In 2006 , corrosion on BP's Prudhoe Bay pipeline in Alaska resulted in more than 200,000 gallons being spilled , the largest spill in the region to date .
Steve Arendt , a Houston - based oil industry safety specialist who investigated BP 's refineries after the deadly Texas City explosion , says he found BP staff resistant to change .
He cites new industry standards for refineries , issued in 1996 , which included tougher procedures for monitoring and operating " safety critical " equipment in the plant .
When Arendt , who is vice - president of ABSG Consulting , reviewed BP 's five US refineries a decade later as part of the investigation following the Texas City explosion , he found that only one refinery had seriously begun thinking about how to implement the guidelines : " One group was waiting for the other group to do something , and was worried about the effect on the others of acting first . "
Most other US refineries were still in the process of implementing the guidelines , but BP lagged behind the industry on the issue , Arendt says .
And its sheer size – Arendt calls BP " the largest and most complicated entity I have seen other than the US government " – made it even harder to implement change , he believes .
Refinery personnel would " push back " on the new practices , he suggests : " For a while after the Texas City explosion it seemed to as though BP was a little bit in denial about how pervasive the problem really was . "
Speaking to a BP official in Houston last month , where the company 's US headquarters and its gulf disaster response effort are based , the Observer got a taste of this apparent arrogance and resistance to outside views .
Asked about scientists ' fears that currents could carry the spilt oil past Florida and towards the east coast of the US and the Atlantic , the official added with sarcasm , " or the moon " , clearly believing that the widely held fears were exaggerated .
BP has consistently dismissed the views of scientists not under its influence , for example rejecting their evidence of the existence of underwater slicks .
BP also seemed to have too much confidence in its ability to control the gushing well .
It is impossible to quantify the impact this corporate culture has on BP 's safety record , but it is reasonable to suggest that such resistance to change and outside views would increase the likelihood of accidents .
Certainly , the number of violations at BP 's refineries cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( Osha ) , the US federal regulator , suggest that , five years after Texas City , the company has some way to go to clean up its act .
When Osha inspected 55 refineries between June 2007 and February this year , 97 % of the serious violations it cited were against two of BP 's plants .
Over 700 violations against BP are outstanding .
The Department of Justice could launch an investigation if it believes the company has violated the terms of the probation deal it struck following the Texas City explosion .
BP has said it believes it is in " full compliance " and is co-operating with Osha to " resolve the matters " .
Arendt says it is fairly normal for there to be differences in opinion with the regulator over the pace at which new processes are introduced , for example , but that such a large judgment gap is rare .
Ken Abbott worked as a subcontractor on BP's Atlantis production platform in the Gulf of Mexico , the world 's deepest moored oil and gas platform production facility , operating in more than 7,000 feet of water .
He claims that in his 30 - year career in the oil industry , he has never seen such disregard for safe engineering procedures .
One of his responsibilities was to manage the database of documents relating the platform 's components .
He took the role in August 2008 , when Atlantis had been in production for over a year .
Abbott , who along with campaign group Food and Water Watch has filed a lawsuit against BP , has testified in congressional hearings that the company was not keeping a complete database .
He claimed that almost 90 % of the 7,000 documents in the database had not received engineering approval , which meant they did not indicate the exact , " as - built " , final form of the components .
He provided the congressional committee with an email from his predecessor that said this " could lead to catastrophic operator errors " .
He told the Observer that BP engineers on the project refused his requests to complete the documentation .
" They admitted that the drawings were not complete .
But their tone was : ' Why do we have to review and approve them and sign them off ? '
They got pretty angry that I tried to push that . "
He alleges that the engineers complained to his manager , and eventually he was fired in February 2009 – over this issue , he claims .
Completing the drawings properly would have taken thousands of man-hours , he says , and possibly several months , potentially disrupting tight production schedules .
" The big concern and primary driver was cost .
I felt there was a whole lot of pressure on contractors to come up with the least cost .
Everyone knew that the quickest way to get run off [ the job ] was not to find the cheapest way . "
He filed a complaint to BP 's independent safety ombudsman , and a letter , seen by the Observer and dated April 2010 , says that Abbott 's claims were " substantiated " .
BP insists that the allegations are unsubstantiated , and that it has complied with regulations regarding compiling and retaining as - built documents .
A spokeswoman referred to a previous company statement on the issue that says : " The engineering documents for Atlantis have the appropriate approvals and platform personnel have access to the information they need for the safe operation of the facility . "
Nevertheless , it has emerged that the drawings on the Deepwater Horizon 's failed BOP do not appear to be up to date , according to evidence given to Congress .
In the hours after the explosion on the rig , BP officials asked Transocean for drawings of the device .
But as the BOP had been modified in China and the drawings Transocean supplied had not been updated , they did not match what was on the sea floor .
BP says engineers wasted crucial hours trying to work out how to remotely activate the device , which represented the last chance of shutting down the well .
They knew the gushing oil and debris would be shredding the blades of the BOP 's blind shear ram , which had to cut through the pipe to close off the well .
More than a day after the explosion , they finally tried to reactivate it , but the ram did not budge .
BP is the biggest employer in Houston , the home of close - knit Big Oil in the US , and uses dozens of contractors .
It is not surprising that Abbott 's employer apparently took BP 's side over his and why contractors may be reluctant to hold BP to account .
Sawyer says : " You would become a pariah if you fall out with BP .
People start to look at you differently .
If you are seen as a whistleblower of some sort , you get shunned . "
He says that in presentations , BP executives like to use a " Swiss cheese " analogy to explain how an accident occurs .
Its safety procedures or barriers – the slices of cheese – are supposed to stop a problem getting through , but gaps appear as a result of human error or the error of subcontractors .
For example , BP initially blamed the explosion at Texas City on plant managers , whom they fired .
Days after the Deepwater Horizon explosion , BP publicly tried to pass off responsibility onto Transocean .
When Hayward became chief executive of BP in 2007 , he promised to focus " like a laser " on safety after the accidents which had taken place under the watch of his predecessor , Lord Browne .
Trevor Kletz , visiting professor at Loughborough University , and an expert on chemical engineering safety , says that it would be unfair to blame Hayward for the Deepwater Horizon disaster : it can take 10 years even for companies genuinely committed to improving safety to affect real change on the ground , he says .
The investigations into how the gulf disaster happened – and in particular how the BOP failed – have only just begun .
Arendt says that BP eventually accepted the safety panel 's findings and made many safety improvements following the Texas City explosion , despite the numerous violations outstanding : " But because of the Deepwater Horizon accident , many wonder if these lessons and improvements were integrated into BP's Gulf of Mexico operations . "
From time to time , I watch Fox News during commercials , just to see what misinformation they are feeding to those sufficiently ignorant to trust them as an information source .
I learned that it ’s Obama ’s fault that there is no immigration reform , and that it it Obama ’s fault that the economy is in bad shape , on and on .
But they went overboard on their latest voter intimidation scam .
As the right wing gears up for its regular , election - year fear - mongering over “ voter fraud , ” there are signals Fox News is setting up Attorney General Eric Holder and President Obama to become this year ’s ACORN for conservatives .
The opening salvo in the latest “ voter fraud ” war came last week when Megyn Kelly interviewed a former DOJ attorney “ whistle blower ” who alleged that Holder has instituted a policy of not protecting whites ’ voting rights or prosecuting African American violators .
Not only did Kelly and Fox News buy into their source ’s secondhand allegations about an insignificant case that showed no indications of representing a larger pattern – either of voter fraud or the DOJ ’s policy – but Kelly trumpeted her interview as evidence that black thugs now have license to intimidate white voters in upcoming elections .
It ’s little more than an outsourced echo of Glenn Beck ’s now - infamous accusation that Obama is a racist with a " deep - seated hatred for white people " but with an electoral , Department of Justice twist .
The so - called whistle blower , J. Christian Adams , is a GOP activist who contends that the DOJ dropped its voter intimidation case against a few members of the New Black Panther Party , who behaved thuggishly at a polling place on Election Day 2008 , because African American Holder – and by extension , Obama – has decided not to enforce whites ’ voter rights .
The DOJ has an entirely different point of view , one that was barely explored on “ fair and balanced ” Fox News , even though Kelly ’s 1 PM show is supposed to be part of its “ objective news ” line up .
The DOJ has said that the case against the Black Panthers was shaky and that this one incident did n’t constitute an orchestrated campaign or pattern to deny voting rights , the usual criteria for deploying federal resources in litigation .
In fact , as Main Justice has reported , no voters at all in the Philadelphia precinct have come forward to allege intimidation .
The complaints have come from white Republican poll watchers , who have given no evidence they were registered to vote in the majority black precinct .
Nevertheless , Kelly deliberately led her viewers to think that Black Panthers would be showing up at voting precincts across the country … [ emphasis added ]
Inserted from < News Hounds >
Let me qualify this by saying that the New Black Panther Party ( or any other group ) ought not to be demonstrating outside of any polling pl ace
There is already more than enough voter intimidation practiced by Republican “ poll watchers ” inside polling places .
Nevertheless , it was an isolated incident , not a pattern , making it a subject better suited for local than federal action .
In the absence of complaints from voters who were intimidated , there was no case to be made .
What we have here is a simple example of the Republican Reichsministry of Propaganda sowing fear and racism in their brainwashed viewers .
CHICAGO --
An arbitrator set Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Antti Niemi's salary at $ 2.75 million on Saturday .
The Stanley Cup champion
Hawks have a 48 - hour window to make a decision .
They can walk away and make Niemi an unrestricted free agent immediately , or accept the decision and sign Niemi at that salary for one season .
The Hawks could also accept the decision , sign and then trade Niemi .
The Hawks offered the arbitrator $ 1.5 million and the Niemi camp came in at $ 4 million , according to sources familiar with the case .
Niemi earned $ 826,875 last season as a rookie .
He played all but one period of Chicago 's postseason run to the title , going 16 - 6 with a 2.63 goals - against average , .910 save percentage and two shutouts .
Niemi , 26 , filed for arbitration as a restricted free agent after his agent , Bill Zito , and Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman were unable to agree on contract terms .
Hezbollah members ' facing Rafik Hariri charges '
By Jim Muir
BBC News , Beirut Published duration 23 July 2010
image caption Mr Nasrallah claimed the UN - backed tribunal was politically motivated
The head of Hezbollah has said that some of its members will be among those charged with the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005 .
Hassan Nasrallah , the leader of the militant Shia movement , said some of the group would be indicted by the UN - backed court within the coming months .
He has dismissed the move as part of a US and Israeli conspiracy .
Mr Hariri and 22 other people were killed in Beirut in a car bomb in 2005 .
Mr Nasrallah said he had been told by current Prime Minister Saad Hariri - the son of Rafik Hariri - that those indicted would be regarded as " rogue elements " rather than representative of the group .
Speaking by video link for security reasons , he said it was part of a plan by the US and Israel to impose their will on the region .
He said the international tribunal had lead Hezbollah to an " extremely sensitive phase " , but that it knew how to defend itself .
' Political '
However , he advised Prime Minister Hariri and others to revise their positions , in the national interest .
There has been rampant speculation that indictments might be issued against Hezbollah members in September , and that tension and violence might result .
But Mr Nasrallah dismissed the suggestion that Hezbollah might start a war with Israel in order to divert attention from the affair .
He said that there were no Syrians among those expected to be indicted , despite numerous early accusations that Syria was behind the assassination .
Modern life is filled with a myriad of products ; many of them are useful , but many of them are junk .
Unfortunately we so often buy into the idea that life is better with these junk products and billions of dollars are spent every year acquiring them .
This is a list of the ten worst products in modern times .
10 Disposable Eating Implements
It is becoming more and more common these days for people to use throw away cups , plates , and cutlery instead of glass , china , and metal .
Not only is this a ridiculous waste of money ( for the sake of saving a few minutes of dish - washing time ) it places a burden on our natural environment .
I am not an environmentalist but even I ca n’t see any benefit to using disposable eating equipment .
There is no reason that children should n’t use glass like everyone else – they did in the old days and it did n’t kill them .
Do yourself a favor , save some money and buy a real dinner set .
9 Disposable Razors
The razor companies have it made – they have a virtual monopoly on the shaving market and people have become so reliant on them that they no longer know how to shave without a throw - away razor .
These razors use cheap blades which go blunt quickly and ca n’t be re-used .
Prior to these razors becoming so popular , men would use a straight razor which could be sharpened as needed on a razor strop .
The initial price of the razor and strop needed to be paid once in most men ’s lifetimes .
You can still buy straight razors ( or as they are affectionately known : cutthroat razors ) and it is well worth the investment .
8 Diet Products
There are two main types of diet products – the first are strong medications that can be very dangerous , and the others are powders , herbal pills , and drinks .
At the worst end of the scale we have drinks that solidify in the stomach so you feel full without eating ( anorexia anyone ? ) and at the safer end of the scale are protein drinks used as meal substitutes .
The fact is , all of these products are bad because they perpetuate the myth that you need to “ diet ” to lose weight .
The only diet that truly works is moderation – eat less .
It saves you money and makes you feel better .
7 Cough Mixtures
When you get a cold or a flu , there is virtually nothing you can do except keep warm and eat well .
Cough medicines are marketed to people who are suffering and want respite – but it does n’t come in a bottle .
Instead of buying incredibly expensive mixtures ( which do little or nothing to help ) , mix together a little beaten egg white , honey , and vinegar and take it by the spoonful – it is cheap and just as effective at clearing phlegm .
If you have flu ache , take tylenol ( or paracetamol ) and lie down for the afternoon .
The flu will run its course naturally and you wo n’t be out of pocket .
6 Self Help Books
Self help books do n’t help .
They are merely a marketing gimmick to get people to part with their hard earned money .
When was the last time you met a person who had become a property tycoon after reading “ Rich Dad Poor Dad ” ?
When was the last time you saw someone beat depression after reading a self help book ?
This huge market now has books for virtually everything you could need , and ultimately the only person being helped is the author who is slowly getting rich .
If you really feel that you need advice on life , try searching the internet for examples from real people who really found a way out of their problems .
5 Sleeping Pills for Children
Takeda Pharmaceuticals is a company that produces sleeping tablets for pre-pubescent and pubescent children .
They used loopholes in the US marketing laws to advertise their products without mentioning the fact that they had not been fully tested on children and without listing any of the potential side effects .
While that is bad enough , it is even worse that there are people who would consider buying these for their children .
In most cases , a child who is not sleeping well can have their insomnia cured by more vigorous activity during the day .
You do n’t get side effects from turning off the television and computer .
4 Microwave Ovens
It is no secret that I despise microwaves .
They have played a large part in the removal of decent cooking from so many of our homes and have helped the chemical laden “ ready meal ” market to blossom .
In some supermarkets it is nearly impossible to find raw ingredients for cooking as the pre-cooked , pre-made meals now take up so much room .
In most cases , there is nothing you can do in a microwave that ca n’t be done better on a regular stove and oven – and in many cases it can take as little time !
Furthermore , oven cooking wo n’t give you food that is soggy , limp , and colorless – a microwave will .
Every time , guaranteed .
3 Ab Machines
Infomercials have been pumping out a variety of ab building machines for the last ten years .
The fact is , these machines are used once or twice and then end up in the garage or a cupboard never to be used again .
The machines do nothing that the human body can’t already do , and if you are earnest about building up good abs , you would be far better off doing regular sit ups and getting a gym membership .
It will probably cost the same price and wo n’t clutter up your home !
2 Sugared Cereals
It was a true genius that came up with the idea of taking something healthy and coating it with loads of sugar to appeal to children .
Unfortunately this concept has now become so popular that many children will refuse to eat any cereal that is not sugary .
All around the world governments are whining about fat children and trying to find a solution by banning all manner of things and trying to promote healthy living – but no one seems to be concerned about the fact that the majority of children start their day with a huge sugar rush followed by a crash and carbohydrate cravings .
1 Bottled Water
Bottled water is an utter waste of money and resources .
To illustrate just how ridiculous a concept it is , I will demonstrate with Dasani Bottled Water .
This product was created by Coca Cola and was marketed as superior bottled water .
First of all , bottled water is a ridiculous concept in the western world where we all have easy access to tap water which is drinkable in most areas .
Coca Cola wanted to be part of the ridiculous fad so they entered the bottled water market , but they simply filled their bottles with tap water !
When the product was released in the UK it was a disaster .
They used the slogan “ bottled spunk ” which may seem innocuous to the Americans who came up with the idea , but unfortunately in the UK “ spunk ” is a slang word for sperm .
Just when you think it could n’t get any worse , scientific testing of the bottled water showed traces of bromate – a carcinogen .
Coca Cola had to withdraw half a million bottles of the water and they pulled the product from the UK market .
El 19 de marzo se registró oficialmente el primer fallecimiento por Covid - 19 en México .
Tres meses y una semana después , la cifra oficial de fallecidos ascendió a 27,000 , aunque existen sospechas fundadas de que el número real es significativamente mayor ; una tragedia .
¿ Cuántas muertes podrían haberse evitado si se hubiese instrumentado una agresiva política de pruebas para identificar contagiados y poder así romper cadenas de contagio ?
No haberlas hecho por ahorrarse unos cuantos millones de pesos es una negligencia criminal .
Tres meses de aislamiento , tres meses de suspensión de gran parte de la actividad económica sin haber reducido significativamente la tasa de contagio , como muestra que el número de contagiados registrados crece a una tasa diaria casi constante de 3 % indica un enorme fracaso gubernamental .
Adicionalmente , la suspensión de gran parte de la actividad productiva ha tenido un enorme costo en el bienestar de una parte significativa de la población .
El Inegi reportó la semana pasada que durante abril el IGAE experimentó una caída , respecto del mes anterior , de 17.3 % y , respecto de abril del año pasado , de 19.3 % lo que nos sitúa en un nivel de producción agregada al mismo nivel que se tuvo en febrero del 2010 .
Dada esta reducción y dado que durante el bimestre mayo - junio la situación no cambió significativamente , es posible afirmar que durante el segundo trimestre de este año el PIB se contrajo a una tasa anual de aproximadamente 20 por ciento .
Esto naturalmente ha tenido un fuerte impacto en el empleo y el ingreso familiar .
Así , en el trimestre marzo - mayo , se perdieron 1 millón de empleos formales registrados ante el IMSS .
Por otra parte , la Encuesta Telefónica de Ocupación y Empleo arrojó que durante abril 12.5 millones de individuos dejaron de percibir un ingreso , situación que seguro no cambió , si no es que se agravó en los dos siguientes meses .
La caída del PIB , que se estima para todo el año sea de 10 % , tendrá otro impacto que ninguna atención ha recibido : la acumulación de capital humano .
La emergencia sanitaria implicó la suspensión de clases presenciales en todos los niveles educativos y , aunque se hizo un esfuerzo por sustituirlas por educación a distancia , esto no fue generalizado y menos aún fue de la misma calidad que la que se hubiese tenido en clases cara a cara .
Fue , para efectos prácticos , un semestre perdido y dado que no se ha controlado la pandemia , está en duda que en agosto puedan reanudarse las clases presenciales .
Pero , además , hay otro aspecto que es importante señalar .
Debido a la caída en el ingreso familiar y el incremento en los niveles de pobreza en la cual se estima caigan 90 millones de mexicanos , es de esperarse que se den dos fenómenos .
El primero es que muchas familias reduzcan su gasto en colegiaturas , lo que implica inscribir a sus hijos en escuelas más baratas o escuelas públicas con el efecto que ello tendrá en la calidad de la educación recibida .
El segundo fenómeno es la deserción escolar , sobre todo en los niveles de educación media superior y superior .
¿ Cuántos jóvenes abandonarán sus estudios para tratar de incorporarse a la fuerza laboral para complementar el ingreso familiar ?
Que los jóvenes se vean forzados a truncar sus estudios sería , en sí misma , una tragedia que aún puede ser evitada si el gobierno instrumenta una política de transferencias directas a las familias ( el ingreso vital ) junto con una política de salario solidario en las empresas formales y un seguro transitorio de desempleo .
Dudo que lo hagan y el costo futuro para el país de un menor capital humano será enorme ; una tragedia a cargo del gobierno .

You 're right , but that does n't make you any less of a dick .
Although this tank represents a great deal of Germany ’s early experimental development , it is reported that only three were produced ( 1937 ) , and that two were seen in Norway ( 1941 ) where they were destroyed , while the third was destroyed by the Russians near the Rumanian border .
The Pz. Kpfw .
V , weighing 36 tons equipped for action , was manned by a crew of seven — commander , driver , main gunner , loader , wireless operator / machine gunner , and two auxiliary turret machine gunners .
In addition to the main turret which mounted a 7.5 cm Kw. K. and coaxial 3.7 cm gun and machine gun , there were two additional revolving machine - gun turrets fitted in the front right and rear left of the hull , each fitted with a 7.9 mm machine gun .
Its suspension consisted of ten small bogie wheels mounted in articulating pairs , and four return rollers .
Between the high front idler and first bogie assembly an additional independent roller resisted the track .
The driving sprocket , unlike usual German procedure , is mounted in the rear , as is the engine , a V - 12 HL 120 TRM , and the transmission and differential assemblies .
The sloping turret and the circular superstructure employed considerable riveted as well as welded construction .
The commander ’s cupola , fitted with periscope , was situated at the rear of the turret .
Access doors were located on each side of the turret .
Riveted armor skirting was fitted along the length of the tank between bogie wheels and return rollers .
Two access doors were located in the forward portion of the skirting on the right side and one on the left .
This was considered a heavily armed vehicle , but it in no way represented German design technique for that period but rather that of several years previous .

You ’ve got to love the Japanese : every time you think you ’ve seen the most bat - shit crazy thing , they go one better .
Take for example this game show that involves competitors trying to get the closest to the breasts of a bikini clad woman on a roller board , but without actually touching the breasts .
Sort of ten - pin bowling except you have to stop short of the two pins .
But because this is Japan , there has to be at least one shock , and there is : an electric shock to be precise , if you go to far and find your face firmly planted between the breasts at the end of the course .
Here ’s a sport that is likely coming to a University near you in the not too distant future : breast bowling .

The 2009 plan to eradicate Canada geese around airports in the metropolitan area , part of a broader goal of eliminating two - thirds of the state ’s Canada goose population .
A longer , fuller version of this article can be read here .
It ’s a doomsday plan for New York ’s geese .
A nine - page report put together by a variety of national , state and city agencies shows that officials hope to eventually reduce the number of Canada geese in New York to 85,000 from 250,000 .
That means that roughly 170,000 geese — two - thirds of the state ’s population — would be eliminated , whether through gassing by the authorities , hunting or birth control .
The nearly 400 geese gassed to death this month after being rounded up in Prospect Park in Brooklyn — as well as an unknown number of other geese killed in New York City in recent weeks — were but a small part of the ambitious overall goal outlined in the document , which was obtained by City Room .
“ The state of New York has close to 250,000 resident Canada geese , which is more than three times the state ’s population goal of 85,000 , ” the report states .
The report does not offer details about how the state will reach that number .
Rather , it lays out specific plans to eliminate most geese near airports in and around New York City .
The report , according to a high - level official at the United States Department of Agriculture , was a result of five months of meetings between February and June 2009 , after the crash of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River .
Canada geese hit both of the jet ’s engines , causing the splashdown .
Those attending the meetings that yielded the report included officials from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation , the National Park Service and key staff members from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ’s office , the official said .
He said that politicians peppered officials from the Department of Agriculture with questions about the science and asked how many goose strikes had occurred and the danger they posed .
They learned that there have been 78 Canada goose strikes over 10 years in New York , and that those strikes caused more than $ 2.2 million in aircraft damage .
The plan was written with the approval of everyone at that table , the official said , including this paragraph :
“ The captured geese are placed alive in commercial turkey crates .
The geese would be brought to a secure location and euthanized with methods approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association .
Euthanized geese would be buried . ”
Phnom Penh , Cambodia ( CNN ) --
A man who ran a notorious torture prison where more than 14,000 people died during the Khmer Rouge regime was found guilty of war crimes Monday and sentenced to 35 years in prison -- with five years taken off that sentence for time served .
The verdict against Kaing Guek Eav , alias Duch , also convicted him of crimes against humanity , murder and torture .
It was a historic first for a U.N. - backed war crimes tribunal .
Duch , 67 , was the head of the S - 21 prison , where at least 14,000 people died .
" It 's clear that he will never be a free man again , " said Youk Chhang , director of Documentation Center of Cambodia .
Prosecutors had asked for a 45 - year sentence with five years ' credit for time served .
Duch pleaded guilty but said he was only following orders and asked for forgiveness .
In the last week of the trial , he argued that international law did not apply to him because he was following orders .
Few people brought to the prison made it out alive ; only about a dozen were found by the Vietnamese who invaded Cambodia in 1979 .
Duch has acknowledged his role overseeing the prison but has sought release after 10 years in detention , angering survivors .
Outside the court on Monday , hundreds of Cambodians , including the Muslim minority known as Cham , watched previous court sessions on large television screens .
Timeline : Rise of Khmer Rouge and its aftermath
" We want to hear directly from the court what the verdict will be , " said Tin Mosa , who along with 40 others from the Cham group , got up early Monday to come to the court .
" I can assume that the international court is good enough to bring justice for the Cambodian people , especially for me , " he said .
" I want to see Duch die in jail . "
More than 10 million Cambodians were expected to watch the live broadcast of the verdict being televised across the country , said Reach Sambath , the spokesman for the court .
" Today is a historic important day for the people of Cambodia , " Sambath said .
At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia 's population -- died under the 1975 - 1979 Khmer Rouge regime from execution , disease , starvation and overwork , according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia .
Another four of the ultra-Maoist regime 's former leaders are waiting to see if they will stand trial before a U.N. - backed tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity .
The tribunal began its work in 2007 after a decade of on - and - off negotiations between the United Nations and Cambodia over the structure and the functioning of the court .
Chhang , director of the documentation center , said his organization was holding verdict watch gatherings in seven provinces so that rural Cambodians could observe .
Chhang said the verdict may not suit everyone , but he thinks Cambodians will be able to turn over a new leaf once the verdict is announced .
" This is what we have , and then we must move [ on ] .
We have our own identity now , our own family , our own society now .
We have to build it , make it strong , to prevent [ the past ] from happening " again , " he said .
On Sunday , parents , siblings , friends and loved ones gathered before monks in a courtyard of the prison site -- now a museum -- to participate in a ceremony to honor the dead .
Among them were survivors of S - 21 , such as Bou Meng , who wept at times during the memorial .
" I have been waiting for justice for 30 years , " he said .
" If the verdict does not please me , I will be disappointed forever . "
Eng Chanthy , 47 , lost her father , six brothers and grandfather to the Khmer Rouge due to starvation .
" I believe that justice will be brought by the tribunal court , " Chanthy said .
" I heard Duch was apologizing to the Cambodian people and asking the people to pardon to him , and I do n't agree with him asking for freedom . "
" I feel that Duch should die in prison .
I do n't want to see him live in freedom , " she said .
It says something about American politics that Gen. Stanley McChrystal was not fired because U.S. casualties in Afghanistan are running at record levels , because the much vaunted Marja initiative has failed , or because the Kandahar offensive is already in trouble during its preliminary rollout .
No , he was fired because he and his team embarrassed the White House with carelessly frank talk to a journalist .
“ This is a change in personnel , but not a change in policy , ” said President Barack Obama in announcing General McChrystal ’s dismissal .
It says something about American politics that Gen. Stanley McChrystal was not fired because U.S. casualties in Afghanistan are running at record levels , because the much vaunted Marja initiative has failed , or because the Kandahar offensive is already in trouble during its preliminary rollout .

“ This is a change in personnel , but not a change in policy , ” said President Barack Obama in announcing General McChrystal ’s dismissal .
Or , in the words of Rep. James McGovern , we have the “ same menu , different waiter . ”
But you could put Mother Teresa in charge of Afghanistan and , with flows of resources of that magnitude , she would be unable to prevent the kind of corruption we see in Afghanistan today .
However , the real story should not be the change in personnel but the continuation of a failed policy , and there is abundant evidence that the policy is failing –both in the Rolling Stone article that got General McChrystal fired and in other recent media reports .
Coalition casualties are steadily rising , and this month is the deadliest yet with over 46 U.S. and 95 coalition troops killed already .
Over the past year , IED attacks have doubled .
The Marja campaign , intended to model the power of the new counterinsurgency strategy , is failing : The Taliban are more popular in Marja than the corrupt official government with which the U.S. is allied and , having melted away during the front - page U.S. military offensive , Taliban fighters are now back in force .
General McChrystal himself referred to Marja as “ a bleeding ulcer ” ( a much more significant quote than what his aides might have called Vice President Joe Biden ) .
The Kandahar campaign , for which Marja was supposed to be a glorious dress rehearsal , is months behind schedule in the face of opposition from local elders and second thoughts from an ill - prepared Afghan government .
So tenuous is U.S. control of the countryside that coalition forces cannot move essential supplies along major transport routes without paying warlords hundreds of dollars per truck in protection money , some of which gets passed on to the Taliban fighters sworn to kill U.S. soldiers .
Most devastating of all ( and the least reported in secondary media accounts ) , the Rolling Stone article quotes American grunts on the frontlines saying they have lost faith in the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy .
And the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan , Karl Eikenberry , has become like Robert McNamara in Vietnam , telling his government in private that counterinsurgency is not working , only to fall in line behind the policy in public .
Finally , the U.S. is losing the war on the home front too , with the Christian Science Monitor reporting that only 41 percent of Americans now believe that the war in Afghanistan can be won , while 53 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Obama is managing it .
Yet the U.S. national security state has doubled down on counterinsurgency , not just in Afghanistan but more generally .
The U.S. Army has heavily promoted its new Counterinsurgency Field Manual , and advocates of counterinsurgency ( such as Gen. David Petraeus , one of the authors of the Manual ) have been promoted to key positions in the military .
Military training of new Army recruits and Marines now emphasizes counterinsurgency techniques .
Africom , the U.S. military ’s new Africa command , has largely organized itself around counterinsurgency doctrine .
Meanwhile , think tanks like the Brookings Institution and the Center for a New American Security , both well networked to the current White House , litter their websites and the nation ’s op - ed pages with homilies in favor of counterinsurgency doctrine .
The U.S. military is , in other words , reorienting itself around counterinsurgency .
And yet , historically , counterinsurgency campaigns have almost always failed .
This is especially so when the counterinsurgents are foreign troops fighting on the insurgents ’ territory .
The U.S. counterinsurgency campaign in Vietnam failed .
The Soviet counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan failed ( as did the British one about a century earlier ) .
The British counterinsurgency campaigns in Northern Ireland and Kenya failed .
The white Rhodesians ’ counterinsurgency campaign against black guerillas failed .
And the French counterinsurgency campaign in Algeria failed –although that has not stopped the U.S. military from building their current doctrine around the theories of David Galula , one of the leaders of that failed campaign .
A rare example of success is the recent Sri Lankan campaign against the Tamil Tigers , but success was achieved by a government on its own territory following a military strategy of exterminist ferocity .
Surely the U.S. does not want to go down that path , does it ?
Rolling Stone quotes Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville , General McChrystal ’s chief of operations , as saying of the endgame in Afghanistan , “ It ’s not going to look like a win , smell like a win or taste like a win . ”
In the inevitable postmortem in future years that will follow the defeat or stalemating of the U.S. in Afghanistan , the loudest voices will belong to the apostles of counterinsurgency who , rather than admit that counterinsurgency is an inherently flawed project , will start to point the finger of blame elsewhere .
Notwithstanding the dismal track record of counterinsurgency campaigns in general , they will tell us the war in Afghanistan could have been won if Obama had agreed to more troops .
Or if he had put General Petraeus in charge earlier .
Or if he had not declared the July 2011 date for beginning withdrawal .
Or if the U.S. had found a more popular ally than President Hamid Karzai .
This will matter greatly because Afghanistan is at the beginning , not the end , of the counterinsurgency road on the U.S. military horizon .
In what was until recently called the “ Global War on Terror , ” counterinsurgency plays the sort of framing and orienting role that containment and deterrence played in the Cold War .
The U.S. military is already thinking about future counterinsurgency campaigns in Yemen , Somalia , and the Philippines .
Given the Pentagon ’s fantasies of future counterinsurgencies , it is vital to make the argument that counterinsurgency has failed in Afghanistan not because of flaws in its execution but because , as I have argued before , counterinsurgency campaigns almost inevitably contain within themselves the seeds of their own failure .
Counterinsurgency forces stand little chance of defeating the insurgents without large numbers of troops , but the presence of foreign troops inevitably excites nationalist hostility from the local population ; the more foreign troops there are , the more hostility there will be .
Also , the more troops there are , the more military casualties there will be , and this undermines support for counterinsurgency at home–as we are now seeing in the UK and the U.S. Counterinsurgency campaigns also benefit from being allied to a strong and popular local government .
We hear a lot these days about Karzai ’s inadequacy in this regard , but it may not be all his fault :
Almost by definition , a leader who relies on external occupying troops for his power will be seen as a foreign puppet and will be compromised in the eyes of his people .
Finally , there is the issue of development , about which the U.S. media and military leaders have shown an extraordinary inability to think clearly in Afghanistan .
U.S. military leaders are surely right to think that they are more likely to win the hearts and minds of local populations if they bring them not just roadblocks , nighttime raids , and detentions , but also power plants , irrigation projects , schools , and so on .
But the problem is that , when you pour huge amounts of money into a poor country , you inevitably produce corruption and all sorts of other social distortions .
Leaving aside the military contracting money pouring into Afghanistan , the U.S. is allocating almost $ 4 billion a year for development projects in Afghanistan , the fifth poorest country in the world ( with a GDP estimated at $ 13 - 23 billion and a per capita GDP of $ 1,000 ) .
And it is complaining that Karzai ’s inability to control corruption in Afghanistan is alienating the population .
But you could put Mother Teresa in charge of Afghanistan and , with flows of resources of that magnitude , she would be unable to prevent the kind of corruption we see in Afghanistan today .
It is not Karzai , but the U.S. strategy of counterinsurgency itself , that is ultimately responsible for the corruption .
It seemed that the U.S. learned these lessons after the failure of counterinsurgency in Vietnam .
For 20 years after Vietnam , the U.S. eschewed the occupation of other countries and learned to intervene either with short , sharp land invasions that led to the installation of a new client regime and rapid removal of U.S. forces ( Grenada , Panama ) , or by deploying U.S. airpower in support of other people ’s ground forces ( Bosnia , Kosovo ) .
But , after the end of the Cold War , boasting that it was the world ’s sole remaining superpower , the U.S. became drunk on fantasies of its own power and , after 9/11 , enraged enough to lash out .
It believed that it would succeed where others had failed , simply because it was the United States of America .
The Obama administration will be defined by three disasters .
The first , the economic meltdown , it inherited .
The second , the BP oil spill , it did nothing to avert .
The third , the failed war in Afghanistan , it made worse .
All three disasters were caused by a carefree lack of precaution .
In the financial world , the U.S. dismantled regulatory structures and trusted the banks to police themselves .
Something similar happened with regard to offshore drilling , with the U.S. government outsourcing its responsibilities to oil companies and placing blind faith in technology to keep the environment safe .
In Afghanistan , civilian leaders have failed to exercise their responsibility to restrain the military and have fallen prey to lone superpower hubris .
Do we have to make the same mistakes in still more countries , wrecking them as we go , to learn our lesson ?
Elle Woods , a fashionable sorority queen , is dumped by her boyfriend .
She decides to follow him to law school .
While she is there , she figures out that there is more to her than just looks .
Mother held for five hours and DNA tested for refusing to give children their ball back to teach them a lesson
Caught in the act : Lorretta Cole was locked in a cell for five hours for refusing to hand over a cricket ball .
When a cricket ball belonging to her neighbours ' children kept landing on her property , Lorretta Cole gritted her teeth and handed it back .
But when it damaged her car , she decided enough was enough .
To teach them a lesson , she refused to return it - and promptly found herself under arrest .
The mother of four was detained for five hours while she was questioned and had her photograph , DNA and fingerprints taken .
Yesterday Mrs Cole , 47 , said : ' I asked police whether if I gave the ball back , I would be given a reassurance that they would speak to the parents .
' But I was n't given an assurance . '
Mrs Cole retrieved the £ 3.99 ball from land in front of her home in North Baddesley , Hampshire , and refused to give it back when the father of the three children came calling .
She was then visited on three occasions by officers from Hampshire Police who tried to persuade her to return it .
They warned her she could be arrested for theft , but she continued to hold on to the ball .
Police arranged a date for her to be arrested and interviewed at Lyndhurst police station .
She was then released on bail pending advice from the Crown Prosecution Service , and will have to return to the police station next month .
A Hampshire police spokesman said that Mrs Cole was ' obstructive ' when officers visited her at home .
She added that the length of time Mrs Cole spent at the police station was prolonged while officers waited for her to arrange for a solicitor to be present .
It is police policy for DNA swabs , fingerprints and a photograph to be taken whenever someone is arrested , she said .
' The decision was made by the officers who attended her home to give the suspect time to calm down and to reconsider her actions , ' the spokesman said .
' They returned to the address five days later .
' She was made aware that the incident would have to be treated as theft if she continued to keep the ball , but that it would be much better for all involved if it could be dealt with by way of a common sense approach .
' Mrs Cole was given the opportunity to return the ball a number of times .
However she left the officers with no alternative but to take action .
' The ball was seized by police as evidence . '
Mom stays home all day with Ben , so I have limited time to spend with my little buddy .
Mom does a great job playing with and educating Ben .
She teaches him to touch his nose and to understand how a cow or a cat ( a ni ni ) goes .
When I come home I have such precious time to spend with him , every moment counts .
One of the things we have that is ours is bath time .
Most every night at around 7:30 we go up the stairs and climb in the shower together .
It is our time to hang out and play in the shower .
He loves to pick out his toys he takes in with him .
His favorite one is his rubber duck and an old Mr. Bubble bottle .
After the shower I prepare him for bed .
I clean behind his ears , dress him , and comb his hair .
That 30 minutes alone time is good for me and Ben as it affords us some alone time to share details of each other 's day .
I share highlights of what I 've done since he 's such a good listener .
Ben shares stories of his day in his own sing song baby speak .
It also affords mom some time alone to collect her thoughts and do some things for her before we both prepare his bottle and take him to his crib for the night .
I do look forward to my evenings !!

The Senate approved a sweeping set of financial overhauls Thursday , delivering a major victory to President Obama two years after the mortgage meltdown and a worldwide credit crisis staggered the economy .
The 60 - 39 vote ends a year of bitter partisan battling between Democrats and Republicans over which party was more committed to ending future corporate bailouts and was standing up for average Americans against the powerful interests of Wall Street .
Only three Republicans - Scott Brown of Massachusetts and Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe , both of Maine - voted for the bill , which was strongly backed by the White House and Democratic congressional leaders .
Supporters of the overhaul , the most far - reaching clampdown on the industry since the Great Depression , said the legislation will help prevent another financial crisis .
Opponents said it was a dangerous expansion of government involvement in the financial system .
The House passed the 2,300 - page bill by a 237-192 vote last month , and Obama is expected to quickly sign it into law .
Only a simple majority was needed to pass the overhaul .
" We 're saying to those who gamed the system :
The game is over , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , slamming Wall Street companies for taking huge risks that brought the financial system to the brink of collapse .
The bill creates a bureau within the Federal Reserve to protect consumers in the financial marketplace , establishes a council of regulators to monitor the financial system for major risks , imposes tough regulations on complex financial derivatives , grants shareholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and gives the government authority to seize and dismantle teetering firms whose failure would pose a danger to the economy .
To help pay for the $ 19 billion cost of the expanded regulation over the next 10 years , the legislation immediately ends any additional expenditures from the controversial $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program bailout fund , or TARP .
The fund was to expire in October .
We have been following cases of citizens arrested for videotaping police officers — often during abusive arrests .
Now , Rep. Edolphus Towns ( D. N.Y. ) has introduced a resolution to denouncing the arrests .
While it is refreshing to see at least one member who is motivated to take action in the face of these abusive arrests , the resolution will have no binding impact on these departments .
Congress can withhold funds from departments that are allowing such arrests .
It is hard not to see these arrests as efforts to try to prevent citizens from gathering evidence of abuse .
Before videotaping became common , many police abuse cases were dismissed for lack of evidence as a disagreement between officers and citizens .
Here is the language of H. Con.
Res 298 :
Expressing the sense of Congress that the videotaping or photographing of police engaged in potentially abusive activity in a public place should not be prosecuted in State or Federal courts .
Whereas prosecutors in several States are applying State wiretapping laws in the prosecution of individuals for the videotaping of police engaged in potentially abusive activity ; Whereas State and Federal wiretapping laws were not intended to be used for such charges ;
Whereas some police departments have been using national security as a justification for the harassment , charges , or an arrest of individuals , based solely on a citizen recording , with no additional factors considered ;
Whereas a study conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2000 indicated that 22 percent of police officers claim their fellow officers sometimes , often , or always use excessive force ; and Whereas the privacy and safety rights of the police officers in the line of duty must be balanced carefully with the public ’s right to transparency and accountability of public servants :
Now , therefore , be it Resolved by the House of Representatives ( the Senate concurring ) ,
That it is the sense of Congress that –
(1 ) citizen recording fills in gaps in existing checks against law enforcement abuses , when balanced with the needs of law enforcement , police privacy , and citizen privacy ;
( 2 ) national security alone is insufficient justification for harassment , charges , or an arrest for otherwise innocent behavior , such as videotaping ; and
( 3 ) members of the public have a right to observe , and if they choose , to make video or sound recordings of the police during the discharge of their public duties , as long as they do not physically or otherwise interfere with the officers ’ discharge of their duties , or violate any other State or Federal law , intended to protect the safety of police officers , in the process of the recording .

Seamus Heaney Poems Back to Poems Page Mid-Term Break by Seamus Heaney
I sat all morning in the college sick bay
Counting bells knelling classes to a close .
At two o'clock our neighbors drove me home .
In the porch I met my father crying --
He had always taken funerals in his stride --
And Big Jim Evans saying it was a hard blow .
The baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram
When I came in , and I was embarrassed
By old men standing up to shake my hand
And tell me they were " sorry for my trouble , "
Whispers informed strangers I was the eldest ,
Away at school , as my mother held my hand
In hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs .
At ten o'clock the ambulance arrived
With the corpse , stanched and bandaged by the nurses .
Next morning I went up into the room .
Snowdrops
And candles soothed the bedside ; I saw him
For the first time in six weeks .
Paler now ,
Wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple ,
He lay in the four foot box as in his cot .
No gaudy scars , the bumper knocked him clear .
A four foot box , a foot for every year .

Patmos , Greece
A tiny , mountainous speck in the Aegean Sea , the 13 - square - mile island of Patmos is where , according to Christian tradition , St. John was exiled in A.D. 95 after being persecuted for his faith by the Romans and where he wrote his Gospel and the Book of Revelation .
Ten centuries later , in 1088 , a monk built a monastery on the island dedicated to the saint .
This established Patmos as a pilgrimage site and a center of Greek Orthodox learning , which it remains to this day .
In 1999 , Unesco declared the Monastery of Saint John the Theologian — along with the Cave of the Apocalypse , where St. John is said to have received his revelations from God , and the nearby medieval settlement of Chora — a World Heritage site .
Unesco stated : “ There are few other places in the world where religious ceremonies that date back to the early Christian times are still being practiced unchanged . ”
Sado Island , Japan
With its dramatic mountains , lush forests and temperate climate , Sado Island is now a popular retreat .
But in medieval times , the island , 32 miles west of Niigata Prefecture in the Sea of Japan , was a place of banishment for those who had fallen out of favor with the rulers of the day .
More than 70 people — notably aristocrats and artists — were exiled here , beginning in A.D. 722 with the poet Asomioyu Hozumi , who criticized the emperor .
Other exiles included the Emperor Juntoku , who attempted a coup against the Kamakura shogunate in 1220 , and the monk Nichiren in 1271 , who preached a radical form of Buddhism .
Today , many attribute the island ’s eclectic population and cultural riches — Sado has more than 30 Noh stages and is known as the “ Island of Performing Arts ” — to the presence of these early exiles .
Île Sainte - Marguerite , France
Just off the coast of Cannes in the Mediterranean Sea , the small , forested island of Sainte - Marguerite — about two miles long and a half - mile wide — was home to one of history ’s most enigmatic prisoners .
The convict , whose identity was concealed behind what was most likely a black velvet mask , was brought to the island in 1687 , during the reign of Louis XIV , and locked up in the Royal Fort , then a state prison .
( His barren cell can still be seen . )
Later , he was moved to the Bastille , where he died in 1703 at around age 45 .
The prisoner ’s identity and the reason for his incarceration are still not known .
But over the centuries , they have been the subjects of much speculation .
One popular theory , that he was an older brother of Louis XIV , became the basis for Alexander Dumas ’ classic tale The Man in the Iron Mask .
The Royal Fort continued to be used as a prison until the 20th century .
Today it houses the Musée de la Mer , devoted to marine archaeology .
Robinson Crusoe Island , Chile
In 1704 , British privateer Alexander Selkirk was marooned on Isla Más a Tierra in the Pacific after quarreling with the captain of his ship , the Cinque Ports .
He lived alone on the rugged 29 - square - mile island , 418 miles off Valparaiso , Chile , for more than four years , subsisting on fish , lobster , goats and seals , until he was rescued by a passing ship in February 1709 .
Woodes Rogers , the captain , described Selkirk upon rescue as “ a man Cloth ’d in Goat - Skins , who look ’d wilder than the first Owners of them . ”
Selkirk ’s ordeal is believed to have been the inspiration for Daniel Defoe ’s novel Robinson Crusoe , published in 1719 .
The Chilean government renamed Isla Más a Tierra to Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966 , in hopes of attracting tourism .
Devil ’s Island , French Guiana
History ’s most notorious penal colony , Devil ’s Island actually consisted of several prisons , one on the mainland near the capital , Cayenne , and three offshore , reserved for the most dangerous offenders : Isle Royale , Isle St. Joseph and tiny Devil ’s Island .
Napoleon III established the penal colony in 1854 , and some 80,000 French convicts — criminals , spies and political prisoners — would be sent there before it officially closed in 1938 .
While there , most of the convicts were assigned to hard labor , either in timber camps or on the construction of a road prisoners called “ Route Zero , ” which was nothing more than a make - work project .
The penal colony was also known as the “ Dry Guillotine , ” owing to the high mortality rate from disease , harsh working conditions and hunger .
( Prisoners who failed to meet daily work quotas in the timber camps were denied food . )
An estimated 50,000 inmates died .
The most famous of several well - known prisoners was Capt .
Alfred Dreyfus , who , wrongly convicted of treason , spent four and a half years there in solitary confinement , from 1895 to 1899 .
Another was Henri Charrière , whose 1968 memoir , Papillon , recounting his escape , became a best seller and a major motion picture .
In the mid-1960s , Devil ’s Island , by then abandoned and overgrown , got new life when the French government chose French Guiana as the location for its space center .
The space agency purchased the three offshore islands , which were under the launch trajectory , and in the 1980s decided to preserve many of the prison buildings as a cultural heritage site .
St. Helena
Located in the middle of the South Atlantic , 1,200 miles from Angola and 1,800 miles from Brazil , the island of St. Helena is among the most remote places on earth .
This detail was not lost on the British , who sent Napoleon into exile here following his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 .
The general and his 26 - person entourage were lodged at Longwood House , the six - room former summer residence of the island ’s lieutenant general .
Napoleon passed the time reading , gardening and dictating his memoirs .
He was free to go wherever he wanted on the property , but had to be accompanied by a guard for outside excursions .
Napoleon died on St. Helena in 1821 at age 51 .
Today , the rocky , 47 - square - mile island ( pop. 4,250 ) is a British Overseas Territory and is still accessible only by water .
Coiba Island , Panama
Fifteen miles off Panama ’s Pacific coast and surrounded by shark - infested waters , 122,000 - acre Isla Coiba is the country ’s largest island .
First inhabited by Cacique Indians and later pirates , it was established in 1919 as a penal colony for Panama ’s most dangerous criminals .
Political dissidents were sent there under the military dictatorships of Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega .
Human - rights groups frequently reported on the harsh conditions of the penal colony , including incidents of torture and murder .
One former inmate , Panamanian journalist Leopoldo Aragón , recalled that prisoners were forced to run a gauntlet , chased by guards beating them with clubs .
The penal colony was shut down in 2004 .
Since the island was never developed , it boasts vast tracts of virgin tropical rainforest , mangrove swamps , pristine beaches and species found nowhere else in the world .
Isla Coiba is also among the last places in Panama where scarlet macaws and crested eagles still exist in the wild .
In 2005 , Coiba National Park — which includes the island , 37 smaller islands and the waters surrounding them — was designated a Unesco World Heritage site .
Galápagos Islands , Ecuador
Between 1946 and 1959 , the Ecuadorean government used 1,790 - square - mile Isabela , the largest island in the Galápagos chain , as an agriculture and penal colony .
Some 300 prisoners — hardened criminals and political dissidents — were incarcerated there under extremely harsh conditions .
Guards ordered them to build a wall out of lava rocks brought from a distant crater — a wall that served no purpose .
A number of prisoners , slaving under the hot equatorial sun , are thought to have died during its construction .
Today the wall is all that remains of the penal colony and is known as the Muro de las Lagrimas , the Wall of Tears .
Robben Island , South Africa
Located seven miles offshore of Cape Town across wind - whipped Table Bay , Robben Island has been a place of exile for most of the past 400 years .
It was used as a prison by the early Dutch and British , as a leper colony and mental hospital between 1846 and 1931 , and as a political prison for non-white opponents of the apartheid regime from 1960 to 1991 .
Many well - known dissidents — Nelson Mandela , Robert Sobukwe and current South African President Jacob Zuma , among them — were incarcerated here under brutal conditions , enduring beatings , harassment and forced labor in the island ’s lime quarries .
In 1997 , the 1,447 - acre island became a museum , with guided tours provided by former political inmates , and today it ’s among the most popular tourist destinations in Cape Town .
Alcatraz , San Francisco , California
Named Isla de Alcatraces ( Island of Pelicans ) by an early Spanish explorer , the small , rocky island in the middle of San Francisco Bay was the site of one of the United States ’ most feared prisons .
From the day it opened in 1934 , “ The Rock ” was a prison ’s prison , receiving other penitentiary ’s most incorrigible and dangerous inmates .
No criminal was ever sentenced directly to Alcatraz .
A total of 1,545 people were incarcerated there in its nearly three decades of operation , including Al Capone ; Doc Barker , of the Ma Barker gang ; Robert Stroud , a.k.a. the “ Birdman of Alcatraz ” ; and George “ Machine Gun ” Kelly .
As the prison was 1½ miles offshore and surrounded by frigid waters with treacherous currents , escape attempts were few .
Of the 34 people who tried , most were recaptured or killed .
Five , however , have never been accounted for and are listed as “ missing and presumed drowned . ”
Alcatraz closed in 1963 because of high operating costs .
During the rest of the decade , Native Americans occupied the island twice , claiming their right to it under an 1868 treaty .
The second occupation ended in 1971 with their removal by federal marshals .
In 1972 , Alcatraz became part of the new Golden Gate National Recreation Area and today receives more than a million visitors a year .
Editor 's Note , August 11 , 2010 : An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that St. John wrote the Book of Revelations .
He wrote the Book of Revelation .
Thanks to our many commenters for identifying the error .
Have you ever imagined what your body , let alone your life , would be like without bones ?
This connective tissue is what gives us shape and keeps our skin and other organs of the body intact .
Bones are what makes our body physically active .
Without them , you will not be able to do even the simplest activities in your life .
Moreover , if you are not in good shape , you will always feel acute pain .
Your quality of life will be compromised until you fix them .
Therefore , it is very important that your bones are healthy and strong throughout your life .
Your efforts to do this have not ended .
You must protect your bones while you live .
Human bones are the strongest between the ages of twenty and thirty ,
This time , the strength in your bones is constantly deteriorating for the rest of your life .
You have to keep your bones strong and healthy , and the sooner you start , the more problems you will be prohibited from doing in the future .
High calcium intake should complement exercise and weight lifting .
Most people have about 90 % of their adult bone mass by age 17 .
The amount of calcium in your bones gradually decreases as you age .
This is one of the reasons why your bones become weak as you grow .
If you do n’t replace this calcium , your bones will become weaker as you age .
In fact , at age 18 , your body stops taking calcium .
This leaves you with only one option : to keep the amount of calcium that already exists .
If you are wondering on how to make sure you have strong bones for years to come .
Here are ways you can have strong bones
Make your everyday diet calcium - rich
Make sure you have enough calcium in your meals , as this is the only source of nutrients for your bones .
Trust dairy sources the most in this case , because they have the highest calcium content .
Milk , cheese , yogurt , kefir are good examples of calcium - rich foods .
With this in mind , there are some great foods for you to get strong bones .
Make sure your diet is rich in dark greens , dark circles , and even broccoli .
Consuming them every day will help you restore bone mass and get strong bones .
When you consume calcium - rich foods , avoid excessive consumption of whole grains , studies have shown that whole grains bind calcium and cholesterol , and help remove it from your system .
Stay active always
Most people with a positive mindset think that “ age is just a number ” and this is very true in this case .
We are aging in our minds , and therefore , as long as we can convince our minds and hearts that we are capable and able to carry out our own tasks , no one can doubt you .
Low impact exercises such as running , cycling , tennis , golf are some of the best ways to stay fit and in shape .
Apart from this , you can also try yoga because it improves body balance and therefore reduces the risk of falling .
Exercising
Also , exercise will be needed .
Some of the best exercises for this process are resistance exercises .
These exercises should tighten the bone structure a little .
In addition , you will want to do general structural exercises to help you tighten your bones , thereby increasing growth .
Usually , after about two to three months , these exercises can begin to increase to a new density .
Sulfur and silica are other nutrients you can add to your diet for strong bones .
Both will help you absorb calcium from the body through the foods you eat .
They can be added through the usual consumption of garlic and even onions .
You can also add in some supplements which you can find out more at harnessingstrength.com .
Conclusion
If you want to have stronger bones through your life , make sure you also keep in touch with your doctor .
Oftentimes , those who treat you can point you in one direction to get the calcium you need , with a diet and exercise plan that can work with you .
They will also be able to tell you if any method you are trying is dangerous in your condition and will be able to offer you an alternative .
The Catalan police are refreshingly friendly .
But if the time for action comes , whose side will they be on ?
The enormous bald detective in beach shorts took the camera from my wife .
" Let me see . "
He scrolled through the photographs , just taken , of me being detained at the campsite gates .
He scrolled past , to see a photo of a limousine convoy , whooshing up the hill to Bilderberg .
" I do n't like this , " he said , and waved a huge , disgruntled hand towards the conference hotel .
" Do you know how much this is costing ? " asked Hannah .
" Do you think the Spanish economy can afford all this ? "
Grimly , the enormous bald detective started deleting images of his comrades with his giant thumb .
" Your opinion , " he growled , " is right . "
He handed the camera back to Hannah .
" But you 've deleted my best shots ! "
The detective whistled to his comrades , who were busy sniffing a jar of salted olives they had found in my car boot .
He had them turn around , facing away from the camera .
" Go head , " he rumbled .
" Take photographs . "
What a difference a year makes .
Last year in Vouliagmeni when I tried covering the 2009 Bilderberg meeting , I had Greek policemen yelling " No fotografia ! " at me at every turn .
I was arrested , tailed , harassed , rearrested , yelled at , bundled into squad cars , lied to , intimidated , wrestled with and hounded round Athens like I was John Dillinger .
This year , the police have been deployed in the same extraordinary numbers , but they are smiling , rolling their eyes at the rigmarole ; the riot police are giving the thumbs - up to protesters and honking their horns as they come round the " awareness roundabout " at the foot of the hotel .
" The police have been laughing and chatting , " says Daniel Turon , a Spanish psycho- sociologist , here in Sitges to psycho- sociologise Bilderberg .
" One of them said he had read a book about Bilderberg ; another said , ' Yes , we understand . ' "
The Catalan police , he says , " have a different sensibility " from what you may expect .
" They are Catalan .
Their minds are independent . "
Their minds , perhaps , have been focused by recent pay disputes .
Two days ago , the police were on strike in Barcelona : they are facing a pay cut next month , as part of Spain 's " austerity measures " ( what the IMF calls " fiscal consolidation " ) – and disgruntlement abounds .
Yesterday , the Spanish newspaper Público quoted the Catalan police union 's estimate , that " the mere deployment of the Mossos d'Esquadra entails costs of € 150,000 for each of the four days of the Bilderberg meeting " .
This union has lodged a formal complaint about the misuse of resources in guarding Bilderberg .
Público shares the union 's concern : " The members of the Bilderberg club have not been elected by the citizens [ of this country ] in a democratic process , but the costs of the meeting is being met by them . "
Ageing Bilderberg sleuth , Jim Tucker , says the Bilderberg group always reimburses the host nation for costs incurred .
But if that 's the case , the police are simply an army for hire .
Turon is keen to humanise the officers facing him : " Look at the eyes of the police , " he says .
" Look at the person who is there .
They want to be with us . "
" Your position is hyper - naive , " laughs his friend , one of the organisers of the Spanish protests , Dídac S. - Costa .
" They are puppets .
They are nothing .
They are a distraction .
They are the cashiers at the supermarket ; we need to confront the supermarket itself .
This is a systemic problem . "
Dídac is a sociologist .
" We need to use the tools of the system against it .
We need a brave judge , a brave lawyer .
We need another Garzón " ( Baltasar Garzón is the Spanish judge who issued the extradition request for General Pinochet ) .
" We need to use the legal weapons at our disposal ; to find a way , as the Spanish say , between the sword and the wall . "
Ivan Torres , from Maresme ( whom we met yesterday , near his roundabout bed ) , found himself caught last night between the sword and the wall , up in the hills above the Hotel Dolce Sitges .
He was out with Rafa Palacios , the founder of the Stop Secrets Movement , trying to stop some secrets .
A spotter on the hotel roof saw them crawling along ; minutes later a police helicopter arrived , and officers swarmed the hills to arrest them .
The policemen looked at the cameras , looked at the footage , then handed it back undeleted .
Ivan and Rafa were brought before the comisario of the Sitges police .
The comisario told them frankly what he thought of them .
" We admire you , " he said .
" We are really sad because we do n't want to have a confrontation here . "
And , like his giant bald underling from earlier , he gestured to the hotel .
" I do n't like these people .
All I want is a smooth operation in Sitges .
The people up there , " said the comisario , " I really do n't like . "
Rafa says that on Thursday , as police and activists squared off for the first time and as Rafa took the megaphone , it was this same comisario who stood in front of the cordon .
" You have a heart under your badge " , cried Rafa , " you have a brain under your hat .
You are the ones we will be drinking with after the football , not the ones up the hill ! "
Rafa reached out his hands towards the cordon .
People who witnessed his speech say this moment defined the subsequent dynamic between the protesters and the police .
" You should be protecting us , not them ! " Rafa implored .
" We are the people .
You are the people .
You are one of us ! "
Rafa says he spoke directly to the comisario when he said : " A time is coming when you may be asked to use violence against us .
A time is coming when you will have to choose sides .
You will have to decide . "
And Rafa says he saw tears in the eyes of the comisario .
" I think , my friend , that I touched his heart . "
• Scouts did well to identify him before the World Cup •
He would have cost three times more , says United manager
Manchester United saved millions by signing Mexican striker Javier Hernández before he shone at the World Cup , manager Alex Ferguson said yesterday .
Hernandez , who joined his new team - mates in Houston yesterday , could make his United debut in tomorrow 's game against the MLS All Stars .
Ferguson , who will wait for news on the 22 - year - old 's fitness before deciding whether to play him , paid tribute to the club 's scouts who plucked the forward from Mexican club Chivas de Guadalajara .
" I think our scouting people deserve 10 out of 10 for identifying him before the World Cup and I think if we had been trying to negotiate after the World Cup it would have been very difficult , " said Ferguson .
" I think a lot of teams would have been after him and it would probably have cost us two or three times more , " he added .
United did not disclose the transfer fee they paid to Chivas but media reports have placed the deal as worth around £ 7 m , including United playing a friendly in Mexico on Friday .
Ferguson was full of praise for the Mexican club for helping keep the deal quiet .
" Our relationship we have built with Chivas has been excellent , they really were very accommodating in everything .
The amazing thing was that no - one in the club said a word .
" At Manchester United we find that almost impossible , news always leaks out at our club but Chivas kept it quiet which was a marvellous asset for us and full marks for their professionalism . "
Hernández will play half that game for Chivas and half for his new club but his debut may come earlier in front of thousands of Mexican fans in Houston .
" He joined us today and so we have to ascertain what he has been doing in the last few weeks physically , we would like to use him in part of the game on Wednesday – partly because I know there is a big Mexican population in Houston and it would be a very exciting attraction for them , " said Ferguson .
" Secondly we want to try to integrate him into the team as quickly as possible so those are the reasons we would like to play him but we want to just have a chat with him and see what he has been doing physically – I do n't think it would be wise to play him without having any real preparation for this game , " he added .
U.S. Troops , Contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan Suspected of Corruption Investigators opened 67 fraud cases in Iraq this year .
June 20 , 2010 -- The U.S. government , which is pressing Iraqi and Afghan leaders to get tough on internal corruption , is doing the same in its ranks .
Cases of suspected fraud and other wrongdoing by U.S. troops and contractors overseeing reconstruction and relief projects in Iraq and Afghanistan are up dramatically .
James Burch , the Defense Department 's deputy inspector general for investigations , says his agency is investigating 223 cases -- 18 percent more than a year ago .
Investigators have charged an Army officer with pocketing cash meant to pay Iraqi civilian militiamen , contractors offering an Army officer $ 1 million for the inside track on a road project in Afghanistan , and three contractors for an alleged conspiracy to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of fuel from a U.S. base in Baghdad .
Army Maj .
John Cockerham was sentenced in December to 17 ½ years in prison for accepting $ 9 million in bribes for contracts to sell water and other supplies to the U.S. military .
In Afghanistan , where U.S. spending on reconstruction will soon surpass the $ 50 billion spent in Iraq , the U.S. government is bolstering its investigative presence .
The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction ( SIGAR ) has a staff of 15 and plans to expand to 32 by October .
By September 2011 , the agency plans to have 49 full - time employees , says Raymond DiNunzio , an assistant inspector general
In Iraq , investigators have opened 67 fraud cases this year , compared with 69 for all of 2009 , according to the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction ( SIGIR ) .
In Afghanistan , it 's 42 cases this year vs. four last year .
Stuart Bowen , who heads SIGIR , says more tipsters are coming forward .
" Some of these people have come back to the States , so they 're out of the threat zone , " he says .
" Perhaps what they saw is gnawing at their conscience . "
The U.S. spent more than $ 1.2 billion last year on reconstruction and relief in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The funds were paid to local contractors , often in cash , at the discretion of officers in the war zones .
" Given the lessons from Iraq , " Bowen says , " ratcheting up the resources devoted to pursuing cases and effective prosecution in Afghanistan is paramount . "
Denial of Rights to Represent Yourself Properly is a Violation of the 14th Amendment
By Dennis Gac
If you ’re going it alone in your divorce case , your child custody case , or your child support order or modification , it is essential that you know and understand your basic rights when it pertains to federal and state laws .
When going to court pro se , you have the right to represent yourself properly in the court system .
If you are denied this chance , the courts are in violation of the 14th Amendment .
By properly addressing the issue and showing the courts that you are aware of your rights as a US citizen , you may in turn cause the case to do a complete 180 and suddenly be in your favor , and not in your ex-wife ’s .
If a Judge denies you the opportunity to bring forth and present evidence to help your case , or denies you the chance to present affidavits that are crucial to your case , you can nab them on the fact that they denied “ substantive due process rights ” and that they are in violation of “ due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 USC 1983 . ”
By utilizing the 14th Amendment in your favor , you will show your Judge that you know your rights as a United States citizen and that you are aware of due process law and protection .
Including and fighting for your right to appeal by bringing up your 14th Amendment rights , you should not be denied the opportunity to fairly represent yourself , whether it be in regards to presenting evidence , affidavits , or anything else that has the opportunity to turn the case around in any party ’s favor .
Dennis Gac is widely known as “ The World ’s premier fathers rights Consultant ! ”
But why would you care ?
Well , I ’ll tell you if you rush over to his site …
I think you ’ll come to your own conclusion that he “ IS ” the real deal !

The Ministry of Justice said the use of restraint on young people is a " last resort "
Details of techniques described in a manual governing physical restraint in private child prisons have emerged .
Measures outlined in a previously secret document include ramming knuckles into ribs and raking shoes down the shins , the Observer reported .
The details were revealed after the Youth Justice Board ( YJB ) agreed to hand over the document after a five - year freedom of information campaign .
The Ministry of Justice said the tactics were used " very infrequently " .
Some of the restraint and self - defence techniques detailed in the Observer include placing an " inverted knuckle into the trainee 's sternum ( breast bone ) and drive inward and upward " .
Another authorised measure is outlined in a description which reads : " Continue to carry alternate elbow strikes to the young person 's ribs until a release is achieved . "
The newspaper says the manual - Physical Control in Care - was published by the HM Prison Service in 2005 for staff working in secure training centres , run by private firms under government contracts .
' Institutionalised child abuse '
According to Children 's Rights Alliance for England ( CRAE ) officials , the YJB initially appealed against an order by the information commissioner in December 2009 that the document be given to them .
It has called for the justice secretary to order an independent judicial inquiry to examine the regimes of private child prisons dating back to 1998 .
Carolyne Willow , of CRAE , told the Observer the manual was " deeply disturbing and stands as a state authorisation of institutionalised child abuse " .
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman told the paper : " For young people under 18 , the use of restraint is a last resort .
" But where young people 's behaviour puts themselves or others at serious risk , staff need to be able to intervene effectively , to protect the safety of all involved . "

New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has died , Steinbrenner 's spokesman said .
“ It is with profound sadness that the family of George M. Steinbrenner III announces his passing , " a statement from his family said .
" “ He was an incredible and charitable man .
First and foremost he was devoted to his entire family – his beloved wife , Joan ; his sisters , Susan Norpell and Judy Kamm , his children , Hank , Jennifer , Jessica and Hal ; and all of his grandchildren .
“ He was a visionary and a giant in the world of sports .
He took a great but struggling franchise and turned it into a champion again . ”
The team has seven World Series trophies – 1977 , ' 78 , ' 96 , ' 98 , ' 99 , 2000 and '09 earned under Steinbrenner 's ownership since 1973 .
" Owning the Yankees , " Steinbrenner once said , " is like owning the Mona Lisa . "
[ Posted at 9:29 a.m. ]
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has suffered a massive heart attack , according to CNN affiliate reports .
Steinbrenner was rushed to St. Joseph 's hospital in Tampa , Florida , and his condition is not known , the station reported .
Steinbrenner turned 80 on July 4 .
The team has seven World Series trophies – 1977 , ' 78 , ' 96 , ' 98 , ' 99 , 2000 and '09 earned under Steinbrenner 's ownership since 1973 .
Steinbrenner is the longest - tenured owner in Major League Baseball , having served as principal owner since purchasing the club on Jan.3 , 1973 , according to the Yankees website .
Over that time , the Yankees have won 11 American League pennants .
Steinbrenner has been in failing health in recent years and his son
Hal is the managing partner of the team .
Steinbrenner bought the Yankees for $ 10 million and under his ownership they have become the most valuable team in U.S. professional sports , with Forbes.com estimating its value at over one - billion dollars .
He also was suspended from baseball twice , once after being indicted for allegedly making illegal campaign contributions to Richard Nixon , and once after paying a gambler to dig up dirt on one of his own players , Dave Winfield .

Xbox 360 owners might have something new to look forward to on their dashboards next to Netflix and Facebook access .
Gear Live is reporting that Hulu will soon be available on the Microsoft gaming console as well .
The tech site is pointing towards an unveiling at E3 2010 in two weeks , along side the hyped Project Natal announcement .
Details beyond this are quite slim - except the bad news might be that Hulu does n't seem to have let up on that idea of a subscription service , to the annoyance of many back in April .
No word on how much this will cost yet except that it might use the Microsoft Points model .
But are you willing to pay for it at all ?
Tracy Schmaler , a spokeswoman for the Justice Department , said federal officials were reviewing the decision and had no further comment .
But lawyers for the plaintiffs said they fully expected the Obama administration to appeal .
An appeal would be heard by the First Circuit , which also includes Rhode Island , Maine , New Hampshire and Puerto Rico .
In the case brought by Attorney General Martha Coakley , Judge Tauro found that the 1996 law , known as the Defense of Marriage Act , or DOMA , compels Massachusetts to discriminate against its own citizens in order to receive federal money for certain programs .
The other case , brought by Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders , focused more narrowly on equal protection as applied to a handful of federal benefits .
In that case , Judge Tauro agreed that the federal law violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution by denying benefits to one class of married couples  gay men and lesbians  but not others .
Neither suit challenged a separate provision of the Defense of Marriage Act that says states do not have to recognize same - sex marriages performed in other states .
But if the cases make their way to the Supreme Court and are upheld , gay and lesbian couples in states that recognize same - sex marriage will be eligible for federal benefits that are now granted only to heterosexual married couples .
“ This court has determined that it is clearly within the authority of the commonwealth to recognize same - sex marriages among its residents , and to afford those individuals in same - sex marriages any benefits , rights and privileges to which they are entitled by virtue of their marital status , ” Judge Tauro wrote in the case brought by Ms. Coakley .
“ The federal government , by enacting and enforcing DOMA , plainly encroaches upon the firmly entrenched province of the state . ”
Last night , the World Future Society 's yearly confab got underway in Boston with a keynote from Wendell Wallach , a lecturer and scholar at Yale University .
Judging by the audience of several hundred , the topic of artificial intelligence , the singularity , and their societal implications are of interest across all demographics .
Wallach is a pioneer in the nascent field of robot ethics and has captured the imaginations of futurists with his theories on artificial moral agents and computational ethics .
In fact , he designed the world 's first course on the subject at Yale , and he published a book last year entitled , Moral Machines : Teaching Robots Right from Wrong .
Wallach immediately engaged the future - hungry audience with a video clip from the opening scene of 2001 : A Space Odyssey depicting man 's upright strife with a bone .
For better and for worse , man will shape technology , and in turn , it will shape man .
He said to get ready for a " wild roller coaster ride through emerging technologies . "
And he delivered .
He rounded it out to a nice list of 10 :
One of the first among a barrage of points Wallach made in his keynote was that Homo sapiens were not the first toolmakers , that honor goes to Homo habilis .
Additionally , we 're not the only ones to use tools pointing to the several kinds of animals that also use them .
The important issue for us , however , is that we 're seeing the beginning of a co-evolution between human beings and their technologies .
We now evolve culturally and are as much as product of our culture as our biology .
According to Wallach , life expectancy is growing at a rate of 1 year every 10 years .
He asks , " What if we doubled life expectancy ?
What would the societal impact be ? "
We 're now attacking death as a disease and the battle can be traced back to the in the mid-1800s when germ theory came into the fore .
A simple solution to germs is to use ordinary bar soap he remarked to the crowd 's delight .
Wallach then moved on the singularity .
For the uninitiated , the term singularity is borrowed from physics and in this context means the point 20 , 30 or 100 years out ( depending who you ask ) at which technological progress will enable computers to reproduce the same level of intelligence as humans .
" The change would be dramatic that it has to be called the singularity , " he said .
Wallach is not entirely bought into the idea , however , calling himself a friendly skeptic .
" We are far from understanding human intelligence and the qualities to pull this off . "
He then proceeded to parse the topic into three areas : complexity , thresholds , and societal / ethical implications .
Reaching the computational ability of the human brain is within sight , but there are other things about the brain that can't be overlooked .
For instance , it is engaged in massive parallel processing and extensive looping , and we do n't know how it self - organizes .
If you damage the brain , there is limited degradation , but with a desktop , if one bit is out of place , your computer locks up .
The thresholds to human - level computer intelligence include things like vision , language , and locomotion , which are well on their way , said Wallach .
But there 's a science of consciousness that has emerged .
" Why do we experience anything at all ?
You need to be conscious to know semantics .
We do n’t understand if consciousness is unique to carbon - based systems , " he explained .
Also consider that humans are comprised of thousands of interlinked subsystems which are required for us to function the way we do .
If not , we have mental breakdowns and get disease .
Can you replicate this kind of complexity with a computer ?
The next segment in the presentation focused on where are we today with computers and how we 'll progress from here to the singularity .
Computers today are limited to specific functions .
But researchers are now mapping a new field of inquiry into Artificial Moral Agents , the implementation of moral decision - making faculties in artificial agents so that they have basic ethical sensitivity .
" We are in the midst of huge change , " he said , pointing to the robotization of the military .
" By 2050 , 1/ 3 of all ground and air vehicles will be unmanned ... is this a good idea or a recipe for future disasters ?
These machines have operational morality .
In other words , they have values of the designs or corporations that build them .
But we are moving into an area where robots need to evaluate decisions .
There are three approaches :
Wallach discussed the role of ethical theory in defining the control architecture of robots , first by noting the shortcomings of Isaac Asimov 's 3 laws of robots , quipping that they 're a nice literary device .
" Humans are a biochemical instinctual , emotional platform while computers are rational from the get go , " he said .
Robots that take care of the elderly , for instance will need to use ethics and react to say the terror of a patient , maybe caused by the robot itself .
Driver - less cars sounds like a good idea and many people say it will solve many problems like traffic congestion and the death - rate on the road .
Although traffic deaths may decrease substantially , accidents will still occur , therefore , corporations will simply not build them because of the liability issue .
They need insurance .
Wallach continued his 1.5 hour long address covering human enhancement technologies , saying that it's hard to separate the promise from the perils and bringing up the societal issues .
" Is this an evolution or a devolution ... do we really need to improve who we are . "
He followed that with a risk assessment saying that the tools we have are very weak .
As for the public policy challenge , Wallach said we are addressing these challenges piecemeal , and that may be ok , but the problem is that nobody asked if it really is ok .
The presentation concluded with a look at research ethics .
He asked if we should lower or raise the barriers for using human subjects and if we should allow for enhancement research .
" Our challenge is to find the middle way that works for all humanity , " he said .
His final point :
The more autonomy we put on the machine , the more responsibility is put on the human .
So we are moving in a circle that is self - defeating .
Nerds never change .
If they get a friend request from a hot girl on a social - networking site , they 'll always accept .
Even if they happen to be military or intelligence personnel .
One security expert proved this with an experiment .
According to Computerworld , security consultant Thomas Ryan created a fake hottie Navy cyberthreat analyst named " Robin Sage . "
He gave her an MIT degree and a flirty mien , then set out to befriend 300 people working in the military , intelligence agencies , and security companies .
What he found will surprise no one :
Despite some patently obvious red flags — such as noting that the 25 - year - old Sage had worked professionally for 10 years — the scheme worked .
The connections to Sage , who was depicted as a real - life Abby Scuito , a fictional character in CBS 's NCIS television series , were established in less than a month .
Many friends freely shared personal information and photos , invited the fictional threat analyst to conferences and asked her to review documents .
Some " friends " at major companies , including Google and Lockheed Martin , even expressed interest in hiring her , he noted .
So , basically the same techniques used to market nude webcam sites to horny nerds will work to extract state secrets from them .
We 're doomed .
The third runway at Heathrow has been cancelled .
ID cards have been scrapped .
There will be no more child detention .
And reform is now under way to make taxes fair for millions of ordinary people .
These are some of the early achievements of a government that had its first cabinet meeting just two days ago .
A new government but , more important , a new kind of government : plural , diverse ; a Liberal Democrat - Conservative coalition that defies the rules of old politics .
I know the birth of this coalition has caused much surprise , and , with it , some offence .
There are those on both the left and right who are united in thinking this should not have happened .
But the truth is this : there was no other responsible way to play the hand dealt to the political parties by the British people at the election .
The parliamentary arithmetic made a Lib - Lab coalition unworkable , and it would have been regarded as illegitimate by the British people .
Equally , a minority administration would have been too fragile to tackle the political and economic challenges ahead .
So , given that the people told us , explicitly , that they did n't want just one party in charge , we had a duty to find a way for more than one party to govern effectively .
And we have .
That 's the pragmatic analysis .
But what I think has surprised all of us in the government this week is the strength of the agreement on principle , too .
No government – whether it's a coalition of parties , or a coalition of rivalries as in the Blair - Brown governments – is able to survive without a core set of common assumptions and aspirations .
David Cameron and I both understand that this government 's unifying realisation is that power must be dispersed more fairly in Britain today : from the Whitehall centre to communities ; into the hands of patients , parents and pupils in our public services ; protecting the rights and freedoms of people from arbitrary state interference ; mobilising social mobility through greater fairness in the tax and school system .
In short , distributing power and opportunity to people rather than hoarding authority within government .
That is why this government will transform the tax system , allowing people on low and middle incomes to keep more of the money they earn .
By making cuts elsewhere in government , we will be able to provide the financial support for our " pupil premium " , helping thousands of children who still do n't get the individual support they need in school .
Education is everything in the creation of a truly mobile society .
We will open up opportunity in our economy , too .
The immediate challenge is to tackle the looming deficit .
Unpopular decisions will have to be taken in the months and years ahead to fill the black hole in our finances .
The challenge for the government will be to do so while always seeking to protect the vulnerable , frontline services , and confidence in our economy .
But we can also start to build a new economy , just as we clear up the mess left behind from the collapse of the old .
George Osborne and Vince Cable will be developing plans to reform our broken banking system , so that bank lending supports the real economy and banks no longer take unjustified risks .
Instead , we will support sustainable growth , balanced across all industries and across all regions , and promote the green industries that are so essential for our shared future .
We will oversee the radical dispersal of power away from Westminster and Whitehall to councils , communities and homes across the nation .
So that , wherever possible , people make the call over the decisions that affect their lives .
And , crucially , the relentless incursions of the state into the lives of individuals that has characterised the last 13 years ends here .
From rolling back excessive surveillance , to ending the criminalisation of innocent people , we will restore and protect our hard - won civil liberties .
I call that agenda liberalism .
Others may have other names for it , but whatever terms you prefer , this is our best guarantee of a fair society .
That is the case I have argued my whole political life .
Yes , as the coalition moves ahead there will be bumps and scrapes along the way ; there has already been significant compromise from both sides and there will of course need to be more .
And , no , we do not yet have all of the answers to the inevitable questions that lie ahead .
While we will be open about our differences , we also know that our strength – the strength now needed to deliver the change needed in Britain – depends on being the sum of our parts .
And from our different traditions we can pursue one simple , shared aim : this will be the government that re-empowers the British people .
I ’ve gathered on the new season ( airing on my new favorite cable network , Starz ) , the show is out to cast a new series regular — Rex Matheson , a wickedly funny ( operative word : wicked ) CIA agent born to make waves .
Almost as key to the new season are recurring characters Esther Katusi , a CIA grunt in her early 20s who learns what she ’s really made of only when she ’s forced to , and Oswald Jones , a convicted murderer and pedophile who will be as shocked as anyone to learn how easily infamy and fame can be exchanged for one another .
And Starz 's new season of Torchwood is shaping up with the search for one series regular and two supporting roles .
Rex Matheson is a white , twenty - something CIA agent who sounds sort of like FX 's animated Archer spy : a fearless , cocky thrill seeker .
Recurring characters include Esther Katusi , a newbie Watch Analyst in the CIA who is deeply ( and secretly ) in love with Rex .
And Oswald Jones is the dangerous psychotic villain .
He 's a forty - something murderer and pedophile who gets sprung from the slammer into the spotlight .
Rex — catch this sicko !
Entertainment Weekly 's Michael Ausiello has published details on some of the main characters that will appear in the new series of Torchwood : A variant of the news also appeared in TV Guide - who is currently promoting his new series of - has reported that filming for the series will commence in January 2011 .
The series is expected to broadcast during that summer both in the UK and the US .
A heat ray gun developed by the US military has been withdrawn from Afghanistan , army chiefs have confirmed .
The Active Denial System ( ADS ) is a non-lethal weapon that heats up the skin " intolerably " but , according to tests , causes no permanent damage .
Its invisible beam is designed to repel enemies and disperse violent crowds , causing anyone targeted to immediately move away .
US military commanders in the country have had the weapon at their disposal but have now decided against using it .
The weapon was never actually deployed in a ' real life ' scenario .
" The ADS was not used and was shipped from Afghanistan .
The operational need for the device was not approved by commanders " , confirmed Colonel Shanks , Chief of Public Affairs for ISAF .
The beam produced by the ADS can travel more than 500 m ( 1,640 ft ) and is seen as a potential way to limit war zone fatalities in the future .
It 's already been tested more than 11,000 times on around 700 volunteers , including journalists .
The US military says the chance of injury is 0.1 % as the beam only penetrates the skin to the equivalent of three sheets of paper
while it looks like a large boat , the marion hyper - sub can dive completely under the water like a submarine .
the boat is capable of high - speed travel on top of the water with a top speed of 75 km an hour .
under water the boat can dive to a depth of 250 feet allowing passengers to look up to the water ’s surface above .
the boat is in the prototype phase but has already made several successful test dives including one lasting 1 hour and 45 minutes using only the cabin air while under water .
an 880 hp engine drives the boat on the surface and under the water on dives .

Word on the street is that Paul , the psychic octopus , had better watch his back - wherever that is .
Death threats have been pouring in for the clairvoyant critter since he , er , predicted that Spain would beat the Netherlands in the World Cup , CNN is reporting .
Paul made his prediction Friday from the aquarium tank that serves as his home in Oberhausen , Germany .
His caretaker , Oliver Walenciak , claimed he is unfazed by the threats to grill him and the like .
" There are always people who want to eat our octopus , but he is not shy and we are here to protect him as well , " the website LiveStreetJournal quoted Walenciak as saying .
Paul picks his teams by choosing to eat from a jar bearing the flag of the team 's country .
He has predicted all of the winners in Germany 's games in this World Cup with 100 % accuracy , NPR reports .
Update at 1:24 p.m. ET :
Not to be outdone , sensitive wildlife from across the globe are now stepping forward to show that they too have skills when it comes to World Cup predictions .
A psychic parakeet in Spain has picked Netherlands to beat Spain in the soccer finals , Agence France - Presse reports .
Mani the bird used his beak to peck at a card bearing the Dutch flag over a card bearing Spain 's flag .
And in Cape Town , South Africa , another octopus , this one named Jabulani , has picked Spain as the final winner , the Indo - Asian News Service reports .
Like fellow octopus Paul , Jabulani also picked Spain when jars bearing the flags of Spain and the Netherlands were lowered into his tank , according to the news agency .

Increasing Hockey Speed – By Jeremy Weiss
Increasing hockey speed is a never - ending pursuit for most hockey players … or at least it should be !!
Today ’s game is much different than it used to be .
The crack - down on “ clutch - and - grab ” hockey has really opened up the ice for the skilled athlete .
We are seeing an exciting shift toward a high - speed , quick - paced game of skill and finesse … one in which slower athletes are being left behind …
LITERALLY !
Any smart hockey player should recognize this change in the game , and should be constantly striving to increase his or her hockey speed .
But in order to do that , you must first understand what makes a fast hockey player .
Hockey speed is composed of Technical Elements , and Physical Elements .
Or in other words : On-ice Components , and Off-ice Components .
The on-ice components are things your skating instructor should be able to help you with such as utilizing a proper knee bend , obtaining a full extension on each stride , eliminating “ head - bobbing , ” striding at the proper angle , using your edges properly , etc …
The on-ice elements MUST be perfected in order to achieve optimal speed .
However , there are three main off - ice components every player should develop that will GREATLY ENHANCE his or her ability to generate speed on the ice .
The three main off - ice components are as follows :
Leg Strength Explosiveness Agility & Footspeed
Increasing leg strength will allow for deeper knee bends , which make for longer and more efficient strides .
It will also help to improve balance and stability in battling and checking situations .
Becoming more explosive will improve that quick burst of speed , and allow you to win more races to loose pucks .
Races are won or lost in those first three strides !
Improving Agility and footspeed will allow you to take more strides in a shorter period of time .
This , combined with an increased stride length , will complete your speed equation––allowing you to take a greater number of longer strides .
There are many ways to improve on these three main off - ice components .
Here are three exercises that I think should be included in any solid hockey training program :
SQUAT FOR LEG STRENGTH :
This video shows the main key points for executing a proper squat .
Squats are a great exercise to increase overall leg strength !
PLYO BOX ROUTINE ( AND VARIATION ) FOR EXPLOSIVENESS :
The first video explains what plyometrics are , how plyometric training can contribute to increased hockey speed , and shows a sample exercise routine using plyometric boxes .
The second video shows what to do if you do n’t have plyometric boxes available to you .
DOT DRILL FOR AGILITY AND FOOTSPEED :
This video shows my favorite off - ice agility drill .
This drill is cheap to set up , and only takes about a minute to perform , so there ’s no excuse not to do it each day !
Summary
Increasing hockey speed is a complex task , with on - ice and off - ice variables .
Go to a well - qualified skating instructor to help you nail down your on - ice components , and participate in a hockey specific strength and conditioning program to improve your off ice components by increasing your leg strength , explosiveness , and agility ––starting with squats , plyometrics , and the dot drill .
Combining on ice and off ice development will help you to improve your speed quickly and effectively this summer !

Two events last week led me to muse on the links between the man who is now our Energy and Climate Change Secretary , Chris Huhne , and the extinction of the woolly mammoth .
A team of scientists suggest in Nature Geoscience that the sudden extinction of the mammoths some 12,000 years ago , as the world emerged from the last ice age , may have had a dramatic effect on the Earth ’s climate .
They argue that the emission by these giant herbivores of nine million tons a year of methane , a greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than CO2 , was so significant that their disappearance led to a sharp drop in global temperatures , and the world temporarily froze over again in the re-glaciation known as the Younger Dryas .
Navy Commander : “ Next time we ’ll use more force ”

A member of the Israeli Knesset , the legislative branch of the Israeli government , who was on board the Marmara ship when it was ambushed by IDF troops , has told reporters that the intention of the raid was to kill as many on board as they could in order to ward off others from attempting to reach Gaza by sea .
Hanin Zoabi , who currently serves as a member of the Knesset representing the Balad party , made the following comments at a press gathering today :
“ It was clear from the size of the force that boarded the ship that the purpose was not only to stop this sail , but to cause the largest possible number of fatalities in order to stop such initiatives in the future . ”
Zoabi added that the international flotilla to Gaza did not have any intention to cause violence :
“ Our goal was to break the siege .
We had no plans for a confrontation .
Israel carried out a provocative military operation .
Israel is used to doing as it pleases with the Palestinians .
The main problem is not the ship , but the siege . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Zoabi , a Palestinian Arab citizen of Israel , also told the media that she did not hear any warning from the Israeli commandos before they boarded the ship , an account that conflicts with statements from several Israeli government officials .
“ They were dinghies and choppers .
At 4:30 am the forces landed quickly .
I did not hear any warning from the ships , because noise was coming from the ships and the choppers .
Within 10 minutes there were already three bodies .
The entire operation took about an hour . ” Zoabi said .
Zoabi described gunshots coming from the Israeli boats toward her direction .
While she also claimed that from her vantage point there was no resistance from the activists once the commandoes boarded , video footage has revealed that the troops were attacked with poles .
However , the evidence suggests that this was after the fact that they had been fired upon , and sustained fatalities , despite raising a white flag .
“ A clear message was being sent to us , for us to know that our lives were in danger .
We convened that we were not interested in a confrontation .
What we saw was five bodies .
There were only civilians and there were no weapons .
There was a sense that I may not come out of it alive .
Israel spoke of a provocation , but there was no provocation . ”
Zoabi said .
Zoabi ’s party published a statement saying , “ Those who should be questioned are Barak and Netanyahu , who gave the order for an armed takeover in the middle of the sea .
Behind this crime are criminals who should be interrogated . ”
As prominent political scientist Norman Finklestein has pointed out , the Israeli government convened and mapped out what actions would be taken against the flotilla weeks ago .
Given that heavily armed elite commandos were sent in under cover of darkness and reportedly fired at sleeping civilians according to eyewitnesses , it can only be assumed that the intention of the Israeli government all along was to use force , as Hanin Zoabi claims .
This is backed up by the discovery of an apparent assassination list which had been prepared in advance by the Israelis , showing names and pictures of people on board of the ships to be murdered , who , according to Israel , were “ involved in the International humanitarian aid for Gaza ” .
Prior to the launch of the Flotilla , it was suggested in the Israeli press that the involvement of pro-Palistinian and Hamas - affiliated figures involved in the convoy , including Zoabi , indicated that the mission was not humanitarian in its nature and was a direct provocation .
The flotilla was also manned by the head of the Islamic Movement ’s Northern Branch Raed Salah and the head of the Arab - Israeli Higher Monitoring Committee Muhammad Zidan , as well as members of the Muslim Brothers activist movement in Britain .
In the wake of what has unfolded , Israeli officials have seized on the presence of these figures to justify the actions of the IDF .
However , while Israel considers these people enemies of the state , it is clear from videos and testimony presented on the websites witnessgaza.com and freegaza.org that the flotilla , which was manned by over 700 activists , intellectuals and political figures from over 40 countries , was entirely peaceful and constituted no physical threat to Israel .
Despite worldwide condemnation , Israeli forces have declared that next time they will use more force .
“ We boarded the ship and were attacked as if it was a war , ” a top Navy commander told The Jerusalem Post .
“ That will mean that we will have to come prepared in the future as if it was a war . ”
Israeli has also released images of what it says are weapons found aboard the Marmara .
They consist of a hammer , a wrench , a spanner , a screwdriver , kitchen knives , wooden and metal poles – all items you would find on board the boat in any situation .
Other items include a slingshot and some rocks and a bottle with tubing and wires that Israel calls an “ improvised explosive device ” – hardly an impressive arsenal , certainly not something you ’d go about attacking a machine gun wielding elite commando unit with .
Another two ships , including The Rachel Corrie , are expected to attempt to enter Israeli waters in the coming days .
Activists on board the Corrie are reported to have decided to go ahead with their attempt to break Israel ’s blockade .
Because the Corrie is is an Irish - flagged vessel , any attack on it in international waters would be an attack on the government and people of Ireland .
Michael Higgins , the foreign affairs spokesman of the Irish Labour Party today called on the Government to demand safe passage for the Corrie .
In a statement , he said some of those on the vessel had contacted him earlier today and had stressed they wanted to avoid conflict and to be allowed unload their cargo to help the residents of the Gaza Strip .
“ The Minister for Foreign Affairs . . . must make it clear that any assault on the Rachel Corrie would be regarded as a hostile act against Ireland and a clear breach of international law that could not be ignored by this country , ” Mr Higgins said .

Comment on this article
One of the prime arguments of the austerity now now now people has been that you ca n’t do the sensible thing — run deficits while the economy is depressed , then turn to budget - balancing once recovery is well in place — because that will lack credibility .
Only by imposing immediate suffering , at great cost to employment , can you convince the invisible bond vigilantes that you really mean business .
And then I learn from Digby that some of these same people just love Paul Ryan ’s budget plan — a plan that calls for a huge increase in public debt over the near term , offset by hypothetical spending cuts four decades from now :
There ’s only one way to read this : it ’s not about the deficit — it ’s about the deficit as an excuse to dismantle social programs .
General Eiland , a former national security adviser , said in his briefing that more ships might try to breach Israel ’s Gaza blockade and so lessons from what happened on the Turkish flotilla were important .
In fact , a Libyan vessel arrived in the area of Crete on Monday , with its crew saying it was scheduled to reach Gaza on Wednesday .
Israeli officials have vowed to prevent it from getting through .
Israel created a blockade against Gaza , both by land and sea , three years ago , after Hamas , which had won elections the previous year , took full control of the Palestinian coastal strip .
The goal of the blockade was to put pressure on Hamas , which rejects Israel ’s existence and was firing crude rockets at its southern communities .
Hamas has held an Israeli soldier captive in Gaza for four years .
Israel has thousands of Palestinian prisoners in its jails and also set Hamas leaders and militants as targets .
The blockade , joined by Egypt , has suffocated the Gazan economy and barred people from coming and going except in medical emergencies , although food has always been let in .
Following the takeover of the flotilla and the deaths on board , international pressure forced Israel to ease the land blockade .
Now the blockade is largely limited to the sea and to materials , like steel , that Israel fears could be turned into weapons by Hamas .
There remains , however , intense international opprobrium because of the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and the sense that the policy has done little to weaken Hamas .
General Eiland ’s report finds that there was at least one gun on board because an Israeli soldier took a bullet in the knee that was not from an Israeli weapon .
It also contends that Israeli soldiers most likely fired only after having been fired upon first .
“ All the shooting was either when the soldiers were in immediate danger of their lives or when they had to rescue fellow soldiers , ” said a senior official involved in the investigation , speaking under military rules of anonymity .
He added that there were between four and six events in which Israeli soldiers were fired upon with live fire by those on board .
Passengers aboard the flotilla have mostly told a very different story , with some witnesses accusing the commandos of shooting randomly as they came aboard .
I keep reading announcements about Acne and getting very confused .
Half the time , I think it 's a typo for " Acme . "
The other half of the time , I realize I 'm reading it correctly and wonder why on earth anyone would name a line after the bane of my existence .
Taliban soldiers train monkeys
Afghanistan 's Taliban warlords have developed a bizarre way to deal with foreign forces : they have trained monkeys who love to eat bananas and peanuts to be killers .
Taliban forces have taught monkeys how to use the Kalashnikov , Bren light machine gun and trench mortars .
They also teach them how to identify and attack soldiers wearing U.S. military uniforms .
Ironically , the idea of training monkeys to fight was first invented by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency .
The CIA in the Vietnam War initiated a program that used the peanuts and bananas as prizes to train some " monkey soldiers " to kill Vietnamese in the jungle , according to a report by British media on June 27 , 2010 .
It is reported that these monkey soldiers are mainly composed of macaques and baboons hunted at an early age in the jungle and sold to the Taliban .
These monkey babies who lost their mothers are sent to a secret Taliban training base one - by - one to become killer monkeys .
Taliban militants use a series of rewards and punishments to gradually teach them how to use the lethal weapons .
Recently , a British journalist went to Pakistan and Afghanistan border of Waziristan ’s tribal region where he witnessed a few of the monkey soldiers armed with an AK - 47 rifle and Bren light machine gun .
Taliban militants in the past have strictly kept the program secret .
However , Taliban leaders have recently taken the initiative show monkey soldiers to tourists of the Pakistan - Afghanistan border area .
Apparently , the Taliban look on monkeys as " propaganda tools . "
"
If a person who loves animals knows the monkeys may be injured in the war , they might pressure the government to force the withdrawal of western forces in Afghanistan , " said one Taliban insider .
A senior U.S. military source confirmed the existence of the Taliban monkey soldiers , military experts call armed monkeys " monkey terrorists . "
In speaking thus , Lord Hope was not really saying anything in his legal capacity at all .
He was simply expressing the ruling orthodoxy of our time .
The same orthodoxy explains why David Cameron makes support for gay marriage a matter of party policy and why the BBC reports the Gay Pride march ( in which , its website preposterously claimed , “ an estimated one million people took part ” ) as if it were Trooping the Colour .
It lies behind the claim , made in advance of the Pope ’s visit to Britain to beatify Cardinal Newman , that Newman ’s wish to be buried with his closest friend , Fr Ambrose St John , proves that he must have been gay , too .
Poor old Newman , is the idea : if he had been allowed to manifest his sexuality in the way Lord Hope approves , he would n’t have been a silly old saint , he would have been out with the Gay Priders , dressed only in angel ’s wings and tight leather pants .
Apple launched the iPhone 4 in 17 additional countries today , causing another round of debate over whether or not the iPhone 4's external antenna design is flawed or not .
A UK consulting firm says its tests show the " death grip " problem is real , and " significantly " worse for the iPhone 4 than other smartphones .
A review from Norway is less critical , suggesting the iPhone 4 gets better signal than competing phones and may be victim to AT&T 's less " robust " wireless network .
Shortly after the iPhone 4 began shipping in the US last month , users started to notice a problem : gripping the device in a certain way led to signal attenuation and , in some cases , dropped calls or poor data connections .
While Apple CEO Steve Jobs was somewhat dismissive of the issue early on , testing conclusively demonstrated that the iPhone 4 had a higher signal attenuation than other smartphones when bridging a small gap on the lower left side of the device 's stainless steel bezel .
Apple later held a press conference that attempted to demonstrate that competing smartphones had " similar " problems , and that Apple had done its due diligence to thoroughly test the antenna before the iPhone 4 was released .
Apple decided to offer all users a free iPhone 4 case to mitigate the problem while the company researched the matter further .
Lest you thought the whole ordeal was over , however , UK - based PA Consulting Group performed its own analysis , using tests similar to those performed by Consumer Reports and others .
Those tests are in line with what we have already seen : the iPhone 4 has a bigger problem with signal loss than other smartphones .
PA 's wireless expert Simon Tonks concluded that " the ' death grip ' issue is real , and is worse for the Apple iPhone 4 than for other smartphones . "
He also added , " The iPhone 4 's radio performance was also found to be generally at the lower end . "
Testing done on live networks in Norway show a similar problem , albeit with some caveats .
Norway 's Verdens Gang newspaper 's testing ( Norwegian ) led it to the conclusion that some of the blame can be laid at the foot of wireless providers , such as AT&T in the US .
Testing there noted the same " death grip " signal loss issue observed elsewhere , but also showed the iPhone performing better than the others in areas of very low signal strength .
These reports are more evidence that Apple 's design choices with the iPhone 4 have led to a very real problem with dropped signals .
While little new light has been shed on the topic , Apple has promised to share any new findings on September 30 , when the current free case program is set to expire .
Here in America , the CIA 's drone program targeting extremists in the tribal areas of Pakistan is the subject of heated debate .
The CIA calls it a uniquely valuable and precise counterterrorism tool .
The Obama administration , which has stepped up the program significantly since taking office , considers it legal under the 2001 congressional Authorization to Use Military Force .
Thehuman - rights community , along with many security experts , fear that the program will create more terrorists than it kills due to anger at civilian casualties .
Pakistanis , however , think the drones are – sorry ; huh ?
What are you talking about ?
Did you say clones ?
That 's according to a new Pew poll on Pakistani attitudes ( . pdf ) that 's filled with surprises .
Top of the list : " Just over one - in - three Pakistanis ( 35 percent ) have heard about the drone strikes . "
Apparently , Pakistanis barely know this program even exists .
Another 43 percent say they 've heard " nothing at all " about the drones .
You can hear the champagne corks popping at Langley .
But it 's not exactly time for bottle service .
Amongst those Pakistanis who have heard of the drones , opinion skews predictably negative .
Ninety - three percent say they 're a bad or " very bad " thing .
Ninety percent say they kill too many innocent people .
While some researchers claim that if you limit your pool of respondents to the tribal areas , support for the drones actually goes * up , * 32 percent of overall respondents think they 're a necessary measure .
( Although perhaps that 's a robust total of people saying a foreign government should shoot missiles at their fellow countrymen . )
And almost half of Pakistanis believe the fiction that the drone strikes occur without Pakistani government approval .
That 's not all the poll found : Pakistanis are freaked out about their economy ; highly anti-American ; and less concerned about terrorism than they used to be – although that latter part might not be such a bad thing .
After a $ 7.5 billion aid package passed Congress last year to bolster Pakistan 's civilian government and reeling economy , here 's what the United States has to show for it : Pakistanis exhibit as much anti-American sentiment as any populace on earth .
According to Pew , 59 percent of Pakistanis consider the United States an enemy , and only 17 percent consider the Unites States a friend .
" Pakistanis give the U.S. its lowest ratings among the 22 nations included in the spring 2010 Pew Global Attitudes survey , " the poll notes .
You have to go to Egypt or Turkey to find similarly negative views of the United States in Pew 's findings – a fact , perhaps , that helps contextualize why the Pakistani intelligence apparatus funds U.S. enemies in Afghanistan , as WikiLeaks reminded us this week .
Still , 64 percent say they want better relations with the United States .
Then there 's Pakistani attitudes on terrorism , something the poll considers ominous .
" As Pakistani forces continue to battle extremist groups within the country , nearly all Pakistanis describe terrorism as a very big problem , " it warns .
" However , they have grown markedly less concerned that extremists might take control of the country . "
Specifically , 69 percent worried in 2009 that the Pakistani Taliban and affiliated groups might rout the government .
Now only 51 percent feel that way .
Is that necessarily bad ?
Haider Mullick , a Pakistani scholar at the U.S. Joint Special Operations University recently returned from a wide - ranging trip surveying Pakistani military development during the army 's 18 - month campaign against the Tehrek - e - Taliban , or TTP .
The effort brought Pakistani troops into tough battles in South Waziristan .
In his view , it 's natural for Pakistanis to be less concerned about an enemy that they see their army battling , especially considering that last spring , the Taliban were entrenched barely 60 miles from the capitol city of Islamabad .
" TTP lost major territory in Swat , Buner , Shangla , Bannu , South Waziristan .
That 's very significant , " Mullick says .
" Also , historically speaking , once an insurgent group becomes weak , popular support for reconciliation goes up . "
And the fight against the insurgents still has popular backing : 49 percent of Pakistanis support it , far more than the 20 percent who oppose it , though 30 percent register mixed feelings .
The Pakistani military effort in the tribal areas is a mixed picture .
By January 2010 , the United Nations Refugee Agency accommodated 114,000 refugees from the fighting in camps it set up in the Northwest Frontier Province , with nearly a million more living in nearby " host communities . "
The military is apparently holding territory in Swat and South Waziristan , though there 's not much of a civilian government presence there .
Militants have been making their way to the Punjabi heartland of the country and the military has yet to advance into North Waziristan , the remaining safe havens of al - Qaida , the TTP and their allies .
But the campaign has won persistent accolades from generals David Petraeus and Jim Mattis , who note – as did the Pakistani ambassador to the United States this week – that more Pakistani troops have died fighting Taliban than NATO troops have in nine years .
Paradoxically , the military 's fight against the Taliban may have impacted Pakistani sentiments toward extremist groups .
Fifteen percent of Pakistanis rate the TTP favorably , though , and 18 percent have favorable views of al - Qaida .
Both are higher than last year 's 10 and 9 percent favorables , respectively .
But Pakistani perceptions of both groups are still down from 2008 levels , when a roughly a quarter of Pakistanis expressed approval of al - Qaida and the Pakistani Taliban .
And the negative ratings for both groups are high , although the TTP 's 65 percent unfavorable rating outstrips the 53 percent antipathy Pakistanis record for al - Qaida .
Still , no matter how you dissect the poll , what comes through is Pakistani dissatisfaction .
President Asif Ali Zardari has an approval rating of 20 percent , more than 40 percent lower than when he took office .
The economy has been hit hard by the global downturn , and about half of Pakistanis expect things to get worse , while only 35 percent were pessimists last year .
" Corruption , economy , energy , inflation trumps the threat from terrorism in many places , " says Mullick .
See ?
We 're not so different after all .

Perhaps Ieshuh Griffin did n’t know any better when she attempted to use “ NOT the whiteman ’s bitch ” to describe herself on the ballot in Wisconsin .
She was called to task by , uh duh , six old white men , retired judges who serve on Wisconsin ’s Accountability Board in charge of regulating elections .
Three of them said ( in so many words ) , “ We do n’t want you to be our bitch anyway , ho ” and two of them said , “ Not so fast , Beloved . ”
Griffin needed four of the former in order to get the language on the ballot so she could become a state assemblymember .
As one of the judges was absent , her name will appear on the ballot without her snappy slogan .
The board , under “ staff recommendation , ” told Griffin her word choice was pejorative , which , along with the profane , discriminatory and obscene , is not allowed .
Concerned FoxNews.com commenter George W wanted to know , “ Why would anyone in any state actually allow a hooker to run for any position of power . ”
Griffin is n’t a hooker , but she is turning a few heads .
Board chair member Judge Gordon Myse said , “ Is n’t she saying , ‘ I ’m not under the white man ’s direction ?
I ’m independent of that . ’
Is n’t that what she ’s saying ? ”
Griffin argued that her word choice was “ a freedom of expression ” and “ not racial ” :
“ ’ Whiteman ’s bitch ’ is in quotations .
It ’s not geared towards a person .
The whiteman is a compound word put together .
A bitch is a dog or a rollover .
[ I have no idea what she ’s talking about here but PRRRREACH , sister ! ]
I ’m making a statement that says , ‘ I ’m not an average politician . ’ ”
Why Griffin did n’t use “ I ’m Not An Average Politician ” to describe herself using the 5 words allotted to independent candidates is up for debate .
She is , however , reportedly suing in federal court .
According to Griffin , “ everyone I spoke with , elderly and young , understand my point of view . ”
Me too , I guess .
Well , sort of ?
Griffin ’s story made me stop and think about modern day white man ’s bitchdom .
Are n’t we all used to being the white man ’s bitch by now ?
Are n’t you ?
Probably .
I mean , who is n’t , right ?
Even white men are used to being the white man ’s bitch these days .
Some people are so immune to the white man ’s “ bend over , take it and like it ” drill that they have no idea what I ’m talking about right now .
“ Me? Noooooo !
I ’m white and privileged .
I have my own bitches . ”
Sure , but I ’m not talking about your garden variety stank bitch .
I ’m talking about the bitches that do what they ’re told because they can’t imagine doing things differently or deviating from the norm and exiting the White Man ’s purview , even though they may have the desire to do so .
People do n’t because , guess what ?
There ’s rarely any money in it and it usually involves conflict , which , who needs that ?
Standing up against
The Man is easy to talk , write , think and dream about , but rarely experienced , witnessed , done intelligently or well - executed .
When The Man ( he looks white from here but I suppose he could be any color ? ) makes egregious mistakes , we all tend to heave a collective sigh of rebuke before we ’re reminded of our bitch status and then we move on to the latest in celebrity gossip .
It ’s simple to forget , being so lazy and all .
“ The white man ’s bitch ” is just another way of saying “ desensitized tool ” and everyone is at least occasionally guilty of accepting this role .
That ’s why I found Griffin ’s choice of words at once charming and terribly misguided .
She could only use five words on the ballot to describe herself to voters and she went with the most poignant , garish , controversial and naive .
“ She says a lot in five words , ” said board member Thomas Barland .
“ It was n’t pornographic , it was n’t obscene and I did n’t interpret it as racial . ”
I doubt I ’d have been nearly as creative as Griffin and my description would most certainly have been pornographic .
So hats off .
Think about it , Griffin only needed five words to say what it ’s taken Tipper Gore decades to articulate .
NOT the whiteman ’s bitch will not be elected to office , but I do think what she did was BRAVE .
And now if you ’ll excuse me , I have a number of episodes of Friday Night Lights to watch and several wars to ignore .
Charlie is the pen name of a woman who works in New York City in a place that is far too professional to discuss being the white man ’s bitch .

According to BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward the equivalent to 10,000 barrels of oil is being captured each day in the Gulf of Mexico by a containment cap .
Around 12,000 to 19,000 barrels are leaking each day , implying that more than half of the oil being released is captured by the containment cap .
Tony Hayward expressed his company 's intention of restoring the Gulf to its original state , after what has been described by many as one of the worst environmental disasters in the history of the US .
" As we speak , the containment cap is producing around 10,000 barrels of oil a day to the surface . "
Hayward said .
When asked about what amount of the leak the oil being captured represented , he claimed it was " the majority , probably the vast majority " .
Hayward feels confident that almost all of the leaking oil will be captured in the following week .
" We have a further containment system to implement in the course of this coming week which will be in place by next weekend so when those two are in place , we would very much hope to be containing the vast majority of the oil . " he said .
According to CNN , the US federal government 's response manager , Adm .
Thad Allen , said it was too early to call the operation a success , while admitting that BP had made progress in the handling of the situation .
" We 're making the right progress .
I do n't think anyone should be pleased as long as there 's oil in the water , " he said .

British royalty is feeling the pinch of austerity .
Her Highness need n't worry about the slashed children 's benefits or dwindling welfare rolls .
But the UK's new plan of pain aimed at calming international investors could wreak havoc on the accuracy of quarterly swan estimates .
The queen is freezing salaries for royal servants and aides earning more than $ 73,500 and reviewing all vacant slots with an eye to reducing her staff of 1,400 -- which includes a royal piper who plays under her window in the mornings and an official counter of swans .
For the first time in her 58 - year reign , the queen has also agreed to regular audits of royal expenditures by the same national agency that reviews education , defense and other types of government spending .
Ask your royal minstrel to read you the full story .
He can find it at the Washington Post .
Forced to rethink and rebrand , gardens are appealing to visitors ’ interests in nature , sustainability , cooking , health , family and the arts .
Some are emphasizing their social role , erecting model green buildings , promoting wellness and staying open at night so people can mingle over cocktails like the Pollinator ( green tea liqueur , soda water and Sprite ) .
A few are even inviting in dogs ( and their walkers ) free or , as in Cleveland , with a canine admission charge ( $ 2 ) .
“ We ’re not just looking for gardeners anymore , ” says Mary Pat Matheson , the executive director of the Atlanta Botanical Garden .
“ We ’re looking for people who go to art museums and zoos . ”
In May , the Atlanta garden opened an attraction that would fit right in at a jungle park : a “ canopy walk ” that twists and turns for 600 feet at a height of up to 45 feet , allowing visitors to trek through the treetops .
Not far away , food enthusiasts can stop in at a new edible garden , with an outdoor kitchen frequently staffed by guest chefs creating dishes with fresh , healthy ingredients .
Edible gardens are the fastest - growing trend at botanical gardens , consistently increasing attendance , experts say , along with cooking classes .
Attendance in Atlanta since May is double what it was for the same period last year .
Public gardens across the country receive about 70 million visits a year , according to the American Public Gardens Association .
But experts say that because of social trends and changing demographics , attendance is at risk if gardens do not change .
Politicians in Pakistan have been left red-faced after an investigation found dozens of MPs have fake university degrees .
Hundreds more MPs have been told to submit their qualifications for verification .
The scandal has triggered fears of early elections and has inflamed a bitter dispute between journalists and members of parliament .
An investigation has found some MPs never finished their studies while others bought their qualifications from dodgy colleges .
The story has undermined public confidence in the honesty of some Pakistani politicians and was broken by several Pakistani journalists .
Higher education officials are now checking the degrees of more than 1,000 provincial and federal politicians across Pakistan .
The chief minister of Balochistan Province , Nawab Muhammad Aslam Raisani , told the press : " A degree is a degree , whether it is fake or genuine . "
Other politicians have lashed out - the Punjab Assembly passed a resolution condemning the media for breaking the story .
That decision has triggered nationwide demonstrations by journalists .
Apology to journalists
The Punjab Assembly has now been forced to back down and yesterday it tried to repair the damage by passing a resolution recognising the pro-democracy role of journalists , lawyers and activists .
PML - N party leader Pervez Rasheed has apologised to the press and says action will be taken against MPs with fake qualifications .
" We are all united on the issue of fake degrees , " he said .
" We all condemn the fake degree holders and we are not again going to give them party tickets for next elections .
That is our principal stand .
" But as far as the media is concerned , we will rectify our mistake . "
Some MPS accused the media of trying to destabilise the government and force an early election .
Other commentators say the story has been a clever distraction from more pressing issues , such as crippling price rises for basic goods .
The controversy has been played out in Punjab , the political powerhouse of Pakistan .
What happens there can reverberate across the country .
Pakistani chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry has condemned the MPs who faked their degrees , saying the whole nation needs basic ethics and can not bank on lies .
The editor - in - chief of English daily The National , Salim Bokari , says the Pakistani media outlets have endured decades of censorship and are now playing an important role in bringing parliamentarians to account .
" So media was terribly gagged and curbed , and since then it has been a really vibrant media and it's now almost impossible to gag it any more , " he said .
" So that 's the situation but it is very , very important for the media to be free . "
The Higher Education Commission is expected to release a final report on Friday , which will reveal just how many Pakistani politicians have been hanging fake degrees on their wall .

” The EU and Canada on Monday separately adopted new sanctions against Iran , targeting the country ’s foreign trade , banking , energy and transportation sectors .
The moves are the latest in a series of measures taken by the international community since the UN Security Council adopted a new round of sanctions in June .
The EU sanctions follow steep US measures signed into law earlier this month by US President Barack Obama , and – according to Israeli officials – the cumulative effect of these moves was that a clear message was being sent to Teheran .
That message , a Foreign Ministry statement read , was that Iran “ should abide by the demands of the international community , ” and that the international community would not “ acquiesce to Teheran ’s systematic disregard of international norms . ” Israeli diplomatic officials said that with the ratcheting up of sanctions , it was also important not to “ take any options off the table , ” meaning not to remove the threat of a military option , as a way of keeping the pressure on the Iranian regime .
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast denounced the EU decision .
“ Moving toward confrontational measures and supporting unilateral actions and damaging the atmosphere are not considered by us to be a good use of the opportunity , ” Mehmanparast said , according to the state television network ’s Web site .
EU foreign ministers in Brussels called the restrictions a “ comprehensive and robust package ” focused on trade , financial services , energy and transport , with visa bans and asset freezes for Iranian banks , the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines .
The ministers reaffirmed the EU ’s commitment to work for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue , and backed a call to Teheran to resume meaningful negotiations .
The EU ’s new measures will come into force in the next few weeks , after they are published in the bloc ’s official gazette , officials said .
“ I think today we sent a powerful message to Iran , and that message is that their nuclear program is a cause of serious and growing concern to us , ” EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said .
“ But our objectives remains to persuade Iranian leaders that their interests are served by a return to the table , ” Ashton said .
“ Sanctions are not an end in themselves ; our objective is , was , and will be to bring Iran to the table to resolve this issue .
” In Washington , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner praised the steps , issuing a statement saying the sanctions “ underscore the steadfast European and Canadian leadership to hold Iran accountable for its failure to meet its international obligations and set a high standard for global implementation of sanctions .
” The statement said the impact of the sanctions against Iran are already being felt , “ as companies around the world refuse to do business with Iran rather than risk becoming involved in Iran ’s nuclear program and other illicit activities .
” Teheran has sought to deflect pressure and further sanctions by displaying a willingness to talk about nuclear issues – a line reinforced Monday by Teheran ’s senior envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency , and welcomed by Ashton .
“ Iran is ready to go back to the negotiating table ” quickly to discuss exchanging some of its enriched uranium for fuel rods for Teheran ’s nuclear reactor , Ali Ashgar Soltanieh told reporters in Vienna .
He spoke after presenting revised proposals on a possible swap to IAEA chief Yukiya Amano , who was expected to relay them to the US , France and Russia – the three nations engaged with Iran in such an exchange .
No details of the latest offer were available .
But under a similar deal in May with Brazil and Turkey , Iran agreed to ship 1,200 kilograms of low - enriched uranium to Turkey , where it would be stored .
In exchange , Iran would get fuel rods made from 20 - percent enriched uranium .
That level of enrichment is high enough for use in research reactors but too low for nuclear weapons .
Among concerns by opponents of the deal was that Iran has continued to churn out low - enriched material and plans to continue running a pilot program of enriching to higher levels , near 20 % – a level from which it would be easier to move on to creating weapons - grade uranium .
The US and its allies argue that the sanctions are in response to Iran ’s refusal to freeze all enrichment activities , and not in response to Teheran ’s fuel swap offer .
EU exports to Iran – mainly machinery , transport equipment and chemicals – amounted to $ 18.2 billion in 2008 .
Imports from Iran , the EU ’s sixth largest energy provider , amounted to $ 14.7 b . , with energy being 90 % of the total .
The new EU restrictions are similar to measures adopted by the Obama administration , which has imposed penalties against additional individuals and institutions it says are helping Iran develop its nuclear and missile programs .
In Canada , Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said the country ’s new measures would include a ban on any new Canadian investment in Iran ’s oil and gas sector , and restrictions on exporting goods that could be used in nuclear programs .
Iranian banks will also will be barred from opening branches in Canada , and Canadian banks will not be able to operate in Iran .
“ These sanctions are in no way intended to punish the Iranian people , ” said Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper .
“ These targeted measures are designed to hamper attempts by Iran to develop nuclear , chemical , biological and missile programs , ” and to persuade the country to engage in negotiations .
Also on Monday , Russia ’s Foreign Ministry said Teheran should stop its “ irresponsible rhetoric ” and take steps to end disagreements on its nuclear program .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Friday accused Moscow of turning against Teheran and joining the US in spreading lies about its nuclear program , in the latest sign that Iran was drifting apart from a onetime key backer .
Ahmadinejad ’s words “ are totally unacceptable to us ; they distort Russia ’s objective approach , ” the ministry said .
“ Instead of fruitless and irresponsible rhetoric , Iran ’s leaders should take concrete and constructive steps to work the situation out . ” Russia has recently shown increasing frustration with Teheran ’s policies , and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev urged Iran to find the courage to cooperate with the international community over its disputed nuclear program .
Moscow has a series of energy and weapons contracts with Iran , including a batch of S - 300 ground - to - air defense missiles .
Last month , the Russian government said the new UN sanctions forbade delivery of the weapons , while Iranian officials later insisted the sanctions did n’t cover contracts signed before the restrictions entered force .

What do Ewoks and transgendered people have in common ?
They were both the subject of an misguided comparison made by Bill O'Reilly on his show .
O'Reilly whipped out this bizarre analogy while discussing a lawsuit against American Eagle with guests Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lis Wiehl .
The suit alleged that the popular clothing retailer discriminated against transgendered workers with its employee dress code policy .
" If you 're a man , you can't dress like a woman , and vice versa , " paraphrased O'Reilly .
" You can't scare the customers .
If your name is Fred , you can't look like Dolly Parton . "
While Guilfoyle and Wiehl sided with the transgendered community , O'Reilly had more to say on the matter .
O'REILLY : " If you owned a clothing corporation , you can say , ' You can dress like an Ewok , if you want "
WIEHL : " Ewoks have nothing to do with gender identity , which is what the law says .
O'REILLY : " Gender identity ... Ewoks have genders too "

A giant “ sausage and wine ” party planned later this week in a Paris neighbourhood with many Muslim residents risks sparking disturbances and will therefore be banned , police in the French capital announced on Tuesday .
The event , announced on the social networking site Facebook late last month ( see page here in French ) , had drawn growing criticism from politicians and civic groups in recent days as its page containing barely disguised anti-Muslim slogans attracted over 7,000 members .
( Photo : French sausages on display at the Paris International Farm Show , February 28 , 2004 / Charles Platiau )
The event , called an “ apéro géant ” ( giant cocktail party ) , was due on Friday .
The main organiser , Sylvie François , wrote that she wanted the event to be “ a joyous protest ” against the closing down of roads in the Goutte d’Or neighbourhood every Friday by Muslims praying in the street outside the overcrowded mosque there .
The Facebook page also appeared to signal the party ’s thrust with appeals to “ native Parisians ” and complaints about “ the resolute foes of our local wines and pork products . ”

The federal government sued the state of Arizona this week over its controversial immigration law , arguing that enforcing immigration laws is a federal responsibility .
And the laughter from Arizona is still echoing across the land .
Of course it ’s the federal government ’s responsibility to enforce immigration laws .
The argument , which we acknowledge may prevail in court , is a laugher in the court of public opinion because it ’s undercut by the historic failure of federal lawmakers and successive administrations to enforce immigration laws .
Just last week , President Obama gave a speech in which he said it was essential to move forward with comprehensive immigration reform , yet he only rehashed old ideas without offering a solid plan or timeline .
As we ’ve said before , if you ’re going to fight to defend your authority , you had better be willing to use it .
A lack of faith in the federal government was the foundation for the Arizona law , and other states will follow suit .
Politicians in Oklahoma , South Carolina and Utah are pushing for tougher immigration laws when their legislatures return early next year , according to a Washington Post report .
We also found it surprising that the federal government would assert in its lawsuit that the Arizona law would harm people ’s civil rights and lead to police harassment of U.S. citizens and foreigners .
Given the last - minute changes made to the law , the Obama administration ’s claim looks like mere pandering to Latino voters .
While we were initially critical of the law , and would prefer to see comprehensive reform passed on a nation level , Arizona legislators watered it down in the final moments of the legislation process .
With the changes , we do n’t see it as the civil rights threat that it once was .
According to the law , police still would be able to detain a person on the suspicion that the individual entered the country illegally .
But one of the changes says that authorities can only detain suspected illegal immigrants in the process of enforcing another law or ordinance .
Furthermore , the law originally said a person ’s legal status could not be investigated “ solely ” on the basis of race , color or national origin .
Lawmakers removed the word “ solely ” and emphasized that investigators must have reasons other than race or national origin to investigate .
Such modifications to the law should have defused the controversy .
But clearly advocates on both sides have ignored the changes in order to further their already hardened opinions on immigration .
However , we do think Attorney General Eric Holder ’s concern that Arizona ’s law will drive a wedge between police and immigrant communities is well stated .
When beat cops are forced to act like immigration cops , it can cause a chilling effect in immigrant communities .
It becomes harder to solve crimes when potential witnesses are worried about being deported .
It ’s yet another reason why this thorny issue needs to be addressed at the federal level .
And soon .
“ The problem is the same as in every gold rush : the gold is easier to see than to mine , ” said Lindsay Conner , a lawyer at Manatt , Phelps & Phillips who specializes in entertainment finance .
More serious financing is starting to trickle in , he said , “ but we ’re a ways away from truly cashing in on either the cost - saving or revenue - generating potential of the Internet for entertainment . ”
Jordan Levin , chief executive of Generate , a digital production and distribution company , was more blunt .
“ Ad dollars are coming back , and digital deal - making may be quickening , ” Mr. Levin said .
“ But it ’s not enough to fuel a robust and dynamic market , and by that I mean a market that is n’t just a bunch of meaningless announcements . ”
Start-ups , many of them self - financed , see it quite differently .
“ We think we are reinventing television , ” said David Levy , C.E.O. of Philo , a month - old social networking service that lets groups of people interact while watching television .
“ More people understand this time around that you have to have a serious idea , ” he said .
“ Just because the barriers to entry are so low that anybody can start a company does n’t mean that just anybody should . ”
Technology is increasingly ripe for this kind of experimentation , says Larry Kramer , founder of MarketWatch.com and author of the forthcoming book “ C - Scape : Navigating the Rapidly Changing Worlds of Media and Business . ”
He noted that Apple ’s iPad and the rush by networks and movie studios to be a part of it  ABC was quick to offer 20 shows for iPad streaming  created a burst of activity by themselves .
Internet - equipped television sets are also becoming more mainstream .
And digital sales of movie and TV shows continue to grow .
The Digital Entertainment Group , a trade organization , said the category generated $ 1.1 billion in the first six months of the year , up 23 percent from the period last year .
Most of the successful digital entertainment companies operate in this area , including Netflix , which recently said that use of its streaming service was running double last year ’s rate .
It ’s well known that Wi-Fi connections are much faster than 3G so you want your Android phone to use the Wi-Fi connection whenever possible .
However , Wi-Fi also drains your battery much faster than a 3G connection .

When a plane crashes we can often recover the black box to determine what happened .
This box keeps a recording of any talk in the cockpit .
Here we present the recordings of the final moments of 10 crashes as found on the black box .
Due to the nature of the recording method , some of the audio is very difficult to hear , so listen very carefully .

10 LAPA Flight 3142
On 31 August 1999 , a Boeing 737-204C , operating as LAPA Flight 3142 , crashed while attempting to take off from the Jorge Newbery Airport in Buenos Aires .
The crash resulted in 65 fatalities , 17 people severely injured and several people with minor injuries , making it one of the deadliest accidents in the history of Argentinian aviation .
As the aircraft started its take - off run , a warning sounded in the cockpit , indicating that the aircraft was not correctly configured for the maneuver .
The crew continued the run , not realizing that the flaps were not at the required take - off position , and were instead fully retracted , thus preventing the aircraft from lifting off .
The jet overshot the runway , breaking through the airport ’s perimeter fence , crossed a road , hitting an automobile , and finally collided with road - construction machinery and a highway median .
Fuel spilling over the hot engines , and gas leaking from a damaged gas regulation station , resulted in a fire that totally destroyed the aircraft .
9 Flying Tiger Line Flight 66
On 19 February 1989 , a Boeing 747-249 F , operating as Flying Tiger Flight 66 , was flying an non-directional beacon ( NDB ) approach to Runway 33 at Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport , Kuala Lumpur , after having flown half an hour from Singapore Changi Airport .
In descent , the flight was cleared to “ Kayell ” , with a morse code of “ KL ” , which four separate points on the ground were commonly called by Malaysian ATC , albeit with different frequencies .
Two separate radio beacons were identically coded “ KL ” , as well as the VOR abbreviation ( Kuala Lumpur shortened to “ KL ” ) .
The airport was also sometimes referred to as “ KL ” by local ATC ( instead of the full “ Kuala Lumpur ” ) .
The crew was unsure of which point they were cleared to .
ATC then radioed to the flight , “ Tiger 66 , descend two four zero zero [ 2,400 ft ] .
Cleared for NDB approach runway three three . ”
The captain of Tiger 66 , who heard “ descend to four zero zero ” replied with , “ Okay , four zero zero ” ( meaning 400 ft above sea level , which was 2,000 ft too low ) .
Subsequent warnings triggered by the onboard Ground Proximity Warning System were cancelled as false alarms , and the aircraft hit a hillside 600 ft above sea level , killing all four people on board .
The proper radio call from ATC , instead of “ descend two four zero zero ” , should have been “ descend and maintain two thousand four hundred feet ” .
8 Adam Air 574
On 1 January 2007 , a Boeing 737- 4Q8 , operating as Adam Air Flight 574 ( KI - 574 ) , was flying a scheduled domestic passenger flight between the Indonesian cities of Surabaya ( SUB ) and Manado ( MDC ) .
The plane was ultimately determined to have crashed into the ocean , from which some smaller pieces of wreckage have been recovered .
The flight recorders ( “ black boxes ” ) were retrieved from the ocean on 28 August , 2007 , while salvage efforts for some larger pieces of wreckage continued .
All 102 people on board died .
A full national investigation was immediately launched into the disaster , uncovering multiple maintenance issues concerning the airline as a whole , including a large number concerning the aircraft .
Another possibility , proposed by the families of some of the deceased , is that the crash was due to a faulty rudder valve , known to have caused previous accidents and incidents on Boeing 737’s .
Debris location has indicated that the plane likely struck the ocean intact .
The final report , released on 25 March 2008 , concluded that the pilots lost control of the aircraft after they became preoccupied with troubleshooting the inertial reference system , and inadvertently disconnected the autopilot .
Offical Crash Report .
7 VASP Flight 168
On 8 June , 1982 , a Boeing 727-212A , operating as VASP Flight 168 , was flying a scheduled passenger flight from Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , to Fortaleza .
The flight departed Rio on its way to Fortaleza .
As the flight approached its destination , it was cleared to descend from its cruising altitude of FL330 ( approx . 33,000 feet Mean sea level ) to 5,000 feet .
Flying at night , with the lights of the city of Fortaleza in front , the Boeing 727 descended through its 5,000 feet clearance limit , and kept on descending until it crashed into a mountainside at 2,500 feet , killing all 137 on board .
Investigation revealed that the captain , possibly disoriented due to bright lights from the city ahead , continued the descent well below the 5,000 feet clearance limit , despite being warned twice by the altitude alert system , as well as by the co-pilot , of the terrain ahead .
As the Boeing kept descending , it struck a wooded mountainside at 2,500 feet and crashed
6 Air Florida Flight 90

On 13 January , 1982 , a Boeing 737 , operating as Air Florida Flight 90 , was a scheduled U.S. domestic passenger flight from Washington National Airport in Washington , D.C. to Hollywood International Airport in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , with a stopover at Tampa International Airport , in Tampa , Florida .
The aircraft crashed into the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River , killing all but 4 passengers and a single flight attendant .
The aircraft carried 74 passengers and five crew members , when it crashed during the failed takeoff attempt .
When the aircraft struck the 14th Street Bridge , which carries Interstate Highway 395 between Washington , D.C. , and Arlington County , Virginia .
It crushed seven occupied vehicles on the bridge , and destroyed 97 feet ( 30 m ) of guard rail , before it plunged through the ice into the Potomac River .
The crash occurred less than two miles ( 3 km ) from the White House , and within view of both the Jefferson Memorial and The Pentagon .
5 Delta Airlines Flight 191
On 2 August 1985 , a Lockheed L-1011 - 385-1 TriStar , operating as Delta Air Lines flight 191 , crashed while on a routine approach to the Dallas - Fort Worth International Airport , killing 8 of 11 crew members and 126 of the 152 passengers on board , and one person on the ground : a total of 135 deaths .
This accident is one of the few commercial air crashes in which the meteorological phenomenon known as microburst - induced wind shear was a direct contributing factor .
4 Northwest Airlines Flight 255
On 16 August , 1987 , a McDonnell Douglas MD - 82 , operating as Northwest Airlines Flight 255 , crashed after takeoff from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport , killing all of the crew and passengers except for a 4 - year - old girl , Cecelia Cichan , who sustained serious injuries .
Flight 255 made its takeoff roll on Runway 3C at approximately 8:45 PM EDT , with Capt .
Maus at the controls .
The plane lifted off the runway at 170 knots ( 195 mph ) , and soon began to roll from side to side at a height of just under 50 feet above the ground .
The MD - 82 went into a stall mode , and rolled 40 degrees to the left , when it struck a light pole near the end of the runway , severing 18 feet of its left wing , and igniting jet fuel stored in the wing .
It then rolled 90 degrees to the right , and its right wing tore through the roof of an Avis rental car building .
The plane , now uncontrolled , crashed inverted onto Middlebelt Road and hit vehicles just north of the intersection of Wick Rd .
The aircraft then broke apart and burst into flames as it hit a railroad overpass , and the overpass of eastbound Interstate 94 .
3 United Airlines Flight 232
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD4fYxDRNwA
On July 19 , 1989 , a Douglas DC - 10 , operating as United Airlines Flight 232 , was a scheduled flight from Stapleton International Airport , in Denver , Colorado , to O’Hare International Airport in Chicago , Illinois .
During flight the plane suffered an uncontained failure of its number 2 engine .
Shrapnel was hurled from the engine with enough force to penetrate the hydraulic lines of all three of the aircraft ’s hydraulic systems .
The hydraulic fluid from each system rapidly leaked from the aircraft , resulting in the inability of the crew to move the flight control surfaces .
Only the thrust levers for the two remaining engines remained workable , so the crew had limited control by using only thrust modulation ( symmetric thrust for pitch , differential thrust for yaw / roll ) .
The aircraft was forced to attempt an emergency landing at Sioux City , Iowa .
The plane broke up on landing , killing 111 of its 285 passengers and one of the 11 crew members .
2 Japan Airlines Flight 123
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue1RDLWLIGc
On 12 August 1985 , a Boeing 747 - SR46 , operating as Japan Airlines Flight 123 , was a Japan Airlines domestic flight from Tokyo International Airport ( Haneda ) to Osaka International Airport ( Itami ) .
The aircraft suffered mechanical failures 12 minutes into the flight , and 32 minutes later crashed into two ridges of Mount Takamagahara in Ueno , Gunma Prefecture , 100 kilometers from Tokyo .
The crash site was on Osutaka Ridge , near Mount Osutaka .
All 15 crew members and 505 out of 509 passengers died , resulting in a total of 520 deaths and 4 survivors .
The official cause of the crash according to the report published by Japan ’s , then , Aircraft Accidents Investigation Commission is as follows :
The aircraft was involved in a tailstrike incident at Osaka International Airport , on 2 June , 1978 , which damaged the aircraft ’s rear pressure bulkhead .
The subsequent repair of the bulkhead did not conform to Boeing ’s approved repair methods .
The Boeing technicians fixing the aircraft used two separate doubler plates , one with two rows of rivets and one with only one row , while their procedure calls for one continuous doubler plate with three rows of rivets to reinforce the damaged bulkhead .
This reduced the part ’s resistance to metal fatigue by 70 % .
According to the FAA , the one “ doubler plate ” which was specified for the job ( the FAA calls it a “ splice plate ” – essentially a patch ) was cut into two pieces parallel to the stress crack it was intended to reinforce , “ to make it fit ” .
This negated the effectiveness of two of the rows of rivets .
During the investigation Boeing calculated that this incorrect installation would fail after approximately 10,000 pressurizations ; the aircraft accomplished 12,318 take - offs between the installation of the new plate and the final accident .
When the bulkhead gave way , the resulting explosive decompression ruptured the lines of all four hydraulic systems .
With the aircraft ’s flight controls disabled , the aircraft became uncontrollable .
1 Delta Airlines Flight 1141
On 31 August 1988 , a Boeing 727 , operating as Delta Air Lines Flight 1141 , was a commercial airline flight that flew from Jackson , Mississippi , to Dallas - Fort Worth International Airport to Salt Lake City International Airport in Salt Lake City , Utah .
The aircraft crashed after takeoff from Dallas - Fort Worth Airport .
Two cabin crew members ( out of four ) and twelve of the 101 passengers on board lost their lives : a total of 14 deaths .
One passenger , who sat in 29C and had exited the aircraft through the aft break in the left side of the fuselage , attempted to re-enter the aircraft , received burn wounds , and died 11 days later .
FAA regulations require a sterile cockpit before takeoff .
This means there is to be no conversation outside of talk pertaining to the plane and pending flight .
( For example , reviewing Pre-Takeoff checklists . )
The CVR tapes recorded extensive talk about the CVR itself , and how , on Continental Airlines Flight 1713 , crew discussions were recorded about the dating habits of the flight attendants .
Coca - Cola is out , and soy milk is now part of San Francisco 's official city policy .
Under an executive order from Mayor Gavin Newsom , Coke , Pepsi and Fanta Orange are no longer allowed in vending machines on city property , although their diet counterparts are - up to a point .
Newsom 's directive , issued in April but whose practical impacts are starting to be felt now , bars calorically sweetened beverages from vending machines on city property .
That includes non -diet sodas , sports drinks and artificially sweetened water .
Juice must be 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice with no added sweeteners .
Diet sodas can be no more than 25 percent of the items offered , the directive says .
There should be " ample choices " of water , " soy milk , rice milk and other similar dairy or non dairy milk , " says the directive , which also covers fat and sugar content in vending machine snacks .
It 's all part of Newsom 's effort to combat obesity and improve San Franciscans ' health , similar to a national effort being championed by first lady Michelle Obama .
The mayor 's administration points to studies linking soda to obesity , including a UCLA one released last year that found adults who drink at least one soft drink a day are 27 percent more likely to be obese than those who do n't , and that soda consumption is fueling the state 's $ 41 billion annual obesity problem .
The study also found that 41 percent of children and 62 percent of teens drink at least one soda daily .
" There 's a direct link between what people eat and drink and the obesity and health care crises in this country , " Newsom spokesman Tony Winnicker said .
" It 's entirely appropriate and not at all intrusive for city government to take steps to discourage the sale of sugary sodas on city property . "
Restricting soda
San Francisco certainly is n't the first municipality to set nutritional standards for vending machines on public property .
The state and at least four counties have adopted or have recommendations for similar policies .
Santa Clara County 's policy , adopted in 2008 , is not as restrictive as San Francisco 's , allowing up to half of vending machine content to be standard soda .
It 's unclear how strict the other policies are .
Bob Achermann , executive director of the California / Nevada Soft Drink Association industry group , said he has n't received complaints about San Francisco 's rule , but said " it certainly sounds a bit proscriptive . "
" This is all about choice .
There is probably nothing more personal than what you drink and eat , " Achermann said .
" Singling out beverages in this whole equation of how to fight obesity is not going to be the answer . "
A multifaceted approach
Newsom floated the idea last year of imposing a fee on retailers that sell soda but has yet to follow through with legislation .
His administration says it 's trying a multifaceted approach to tackling obesity , including the Shape Up San Francisco exercise program and periodic Sunday street closures to encourage outside activity .
" This is not about the soda police or a crackdown on soda , " Winnicker said .
" People absolutely remain free to choose to drink unhealthy sugary sodas anywhere they want . "
Selling them is another matter .
While the mayor 's order contains exceptions for vending machines covered under already negotiated contracts , it directs department heads to have new contracts conform to the new standards .
That 's the case in the current bidding process for a five - year lease to run a cafe in the basement of City Hall .
The vending machine requirement will also be included when bids go out for a cafe at the Hall of Justice , Deputy City Administrator Amy Brown said .
Chong Park , who 's managed the City Hall Café for nine years , says she averages less than $ 100 a month on her cut from two gleaming red Coca - Cola machines at the doors to her cafe .
But with the future lease on the space up for grabs , she 's trying to bring the stock in her refrigerator cases in line with Newsom 's directive , and that 's going to impact her bottom line , Park said .
She gets about 15 percent of her business selling those sodas , and replacing them with 100 percent juice will be expensive , Park said .
" The future is going to be affected , " Park said .
" But I do n't want to be in trouble with the mayor .
I like him very much . "
Reem Nasra , who runs the Mint cafe at the Civic Center branch of San Francisco Superior Court , has put in a bid for the City Hall cafe .
" As far as meeting the guidelines , " Nasra said , " I do n't have any issues with that . "

A group of Algerians has launched a petition seeking reparations from former colonial ruler France for victims of nuclear tests carried out in the Sahara .
Algerian state news agency APS says the petition asks France " to recognize this situation and take its responsibilities " by creating a fund to pay for health problems related to the tests and to manage the waste they produced .
APS says the petition was started Saturday by a group of researchers , lawyers and journalists .
It asks France to declassify archives about the 17 tests carried out in Algeria in the 1960s .
France passed a law last year allowing for compensation to those who suffered from nuclear tests in the Sahara and the South Pacific , on a case - by - case basis .

The Margins of the World : Going Back to Hicksville
In Dylan Horrocks�s Hicksville , a journalist investigates a remote New Zealand town -- a mysterious place where every man , woman , and child seem to read comic books .
It was a critical darling when originally released in 1998 , widely seen as a love letter to comics .
More recently , though , it�s been described as �hate mail to the industry that betrayed its original vision .� �
I�d say Hicksville is both .
The book�s been unavailable for so long that when I had the chance to sit down with Dylan , he told me it�d been passed around like �samizdat literature� back home in New Zealand .
Now Hicksville is finally back in print , and it comes with a new , brutally honest introduction from Dylan .
I�ll let him explain why : �
� Hicksville came out 12 years ago , and I started drawing it 18 years ago .
To me , it �s very old work .
But the difficult thing is that I haven�t finished another book since then , apart from DC Comics stuff which I don�t really consider my work and a few issues of Atlas , serialized stories that haven�t been finished .
I was very conscious that I was doing a new edition of Hicksville without having done another book since .
That made me really uncomfortable about doing the new introduction .
�
� But going back to Hicksville -- scanning the whole thing in again , repositioning all the artwork on the page , deciding that the design of the book would be entirely hand - lettered -- it was almost like I subconsciously forced myself to make it a labor of love .
In the process , I had to reconnect with the love that first motivated the book .
My love of comics , and what had happened to it .��
So what had happened to it ?
In his comic The Last Fox Story � -- drawn years before Hicksville , and drawn with a ballpoint pen on whatever paper was at hand -- he describes the first time he felt allergic to comic books .
He enters a comic shop and �halfway in , I �m sweating .
By the time I reach Love & Rockets , I �m dizzy and have a pain in my gut .��
� My relationship with comics was very simple before I took the step of trying to make it a career .
That�s when I had the first real experience of my fear of comics .
I extricated myself from much of it by explaining it in The Last Fox Story .
In a way , doing the new introduction to Hicksville was like doing that story again -- bringing it up to date .
My fear of comics would come and go .
When I was drawing Pickle in the 1990s -- where I was serializing Hicksville -- I still felt really uncomfortable going into comic shops .
�
� I remember my friend Roger Langridge persuading me to try Bone by Jeff Smith , and I remember reading those obsessively , like a drowning man clinging to a raft .
Reading Bone felt pure .
It was sheer pleasure .
It felt simple -- not tangled up with all my anxieties about comics .
I don�t know why .
I�ve always been enormously fond of Bone for that reason .��
In Hicksville , cartoonist Sam Zabel faces the temptation of moving from New Zealand to Los Angeles , trading his zines for soulless superhero comics .
In reality , Dylan Horrocks�s success led him writing for DC Comics in 2003 .
( It �s the sort of raised - eyebrow irony beloved by Rod Serling . )
Dylan admits in the new introduction that he �should have listened to Sam .��
� It �s a very difficult living being an alternative cartoonist , so the notion that I could make a living writing comics ?
I figured , well , that can�t take up too much time .
I�ll work on my own stuff , my real stuff , the rest of the time .
What I hadn�t factored in was that I didn�t have any idea what I was doing .
I didn�t grow up reading those comics .
I think if I had , I would�ve had a kind of fantasy about how I�d write them .
� How would I write Batman ?��
� But when DC asked me if I�d write Batgirl , I imagined her from the �60s TV show .
That �s what I had in mind : the yellow boots , and the purple motorbike .
She�s a librarian , man !
She�s got the coolest job in the world !
She goes out at night and go - go dances and occasionally fights a bad guy .
I thought it�d be so much fun .
I underestimated how dark Gotham City had become .
I was very much at sea .
The funny thing is that now I have some distance , I know exactly how I�d write Batgirl -- but I don�t know whether it�s something they�d want to publish . �
Peppered with painful quotes -- like Jack Kirby�s � Comics will break your heart � --
Hicksville often seems strangely like the work of an artist who�s reflecting back after a long career .
I never doubted , however , that it remained at least in love with the idea of stories .
I was surprised to hear Dylan didn�t necessarily agree : �
� I was at my lowest point when I was writing for DC , and it took quite a long time to recover .
I hadn�t just fallen out of love with comics -- and I don�t know if I had , or if I just felt estranged from them -- but I �d fallen out of love with stories .
Picasso said , ' Art is the lie that tells the truth , ' but I felt like maybe art is actually just a lie .
Stories have a tendency to construct a fake model of the universe , a kind of artificial reality , in which things are simpler and questions have answers . �
� It �s the same with supposedly serious literary fiction .
There�s a tendency to present the world as saturated with meaning and significance , and to then construct these elegant architectural structures which have recurring metaphors and everything else .
Life�s just not like that .
When I was at my most depressed , I remember a friend saying to me : � What you �re going through is a crisis of faith . �
I think he was right . �
Hicksville contains stories within stories .
It not only incorporates snippets from old myths and old comics , but its characters dress up as other famous creations : Charlie Brown , old - school Batgirl , Winsor McCay�s Mr. Bunion carrying his suitcase marked " DULL CARE . "
It �s easy to feel lost in Hicksville .
Maybe that �s why it�s also full of maps .
As Dylan has one enigmatic cartographer say : � The true drama is in these relationships of space .��
� The strange thing is that I really only read nonfiction these days .
I find a very difficult to read novels for all these reasons -- with a few exceptions .
Every so often I go on a little binge and find a few novels that can cut through my allergic reactions .
But I only feel compelled to write fiction !
I feel this need to write stories , but I don�t believe in them anymore .
It took me a few years to work out different ways of seeing stories .
Ways that were , for me , meaningful and healthy .
�
� I started to think of stories more as a kind of �waking dreaming � --
I�m really interested in the daydream as a way of exploring things .
I wrote a long essay a few years ago about the way stories and art construct imaginary universes , imaginary landscapes , and I did that as a way to solve this conundrum too .
Instead of making up a sequence of events or telling a story that �s supposedly to do with the real world , I �m constructing an environment and exploring it .
It �s treating story purely as a process of exploration .��
What if , somewhere , there was a secret library of all the stories you want most to read ?
Hicksville perfectly captures this adolescent fantasy .
( I know it was one of mine . )
And , better still , what if all these comic books -- stories that inevitably come from America and Europe and Japan -- are tucked away deep in the southern hemisphere ? �
� In Hicksville , I was trying to work out how I felt about comics , and how the rest of the world felt about comics , too .
But I was also trying to work out my relationship with New Zealand -- I�d been overseas , and I�d initially had very mixed feelings about coming back .
I was in love with my girlfriend , and she wanted to live in there .
In the end , I decided I�d live in Antarctica if that �s what it took to be with her .
So I came back , and I found myself reconnecting with things about New Zealand -- things I loved very deeply .
�
� Comics are at the margins of the worlds of literature and art .
And the thing about New Zealand , of course , is that it�s in the margins of the world , too .
Hicksville was set on the easternmost cape of New Zealand .
I think what I was partly trying to do was to say , okay , yes , I live at the edge of the fucking world , and I �m obsessed with this marginal art form -- but to me , they �re the most important places .
I was looking out at the rest of the world and saying : � This is the centre of the world as far as I �m concerned .
Now how does the rest of it look to me ?�
In a way , I ended up reshaping the whole world around that centre .��

What if what was in your wallet really did make you a better person — or at least perceived as one ?
The closest thing to such a notion may be the American Express Centurion Card , also known as the Black Card .
Released in 1999 , AmEx has successfully created an aura of mystery and power around this rectangle made of sturdy titanium .
While American Express is decidedly discrete about the details of membership , this is what we do know : the Black Card has no credit limit , cards are issued by invitation only and one of the criteria considered for an invitation is annual credit card charges — those interviewed for the story claim that the threshold for invitation has been lowered from $ 1 million to $ 250,000 in recent years .
What is clear is that the one - time $ 5,000 initiation fee and annual $ 2,500 membership does come with unique perks , including airline and hotel upgrades , and a personalized concierge service that helps with travel and restaurant reservations as well as shopping procurement — benefits many holders say are the Black Card ’s true value .
But this hard - to - get credit card , with its unusual black appearance and hefty metal weight , does more than ensure access to airport lounges .
Evoking allure of wealth and power , it is known to curry favor and fawning by those who covet it .
We interviewed some Black Card holders , as well as those who have been in its presence , about the privileges that only membership can buy .
Want great service ?
Mention the card
Social media entrepreneur and media consultant Peter Shankman says that while the concierge service has saved him in many personal and professional pickles , he flashed the titanium just once in an effort to evoke VIP service .
It worked .
Shankman was in desperate need of a new suit and was browsing in an Armani store wearing his usual uniform of T - shirt and jeans .
“ No one paid me any attention .
It was right out of ‘ Pretty Woman , ' ” he says .
“ Finally , I said loudly , ‘ Never mind !
I ’ll take my Black Card and go to Prada ! ’
Within a minute , eight sales guys were there ready to help me . ”
I like to use it to impress the ladies , and they certainly are very inquisitive about it .
I think that it shows that you are not only responsible with your money , but that you have arrived financially in your life and in your career .

Owner , Madame Paulette
Broke , but wo n’t give up his Black Card
Not all stories are so entertaining .
Aylin Unal says a longtime friend finally qualified for a Black Card after coveting one for years .
He immediately made a point of showing it off frequently .
“ Even if he charges $ 3 , he makes sure to put the card in front of everybody , ” Unal says .
“ He carries everything on a money clip and the card is always on the outside . ”
In recent years , the friend found himself in six - figures of business and consumer debt and had his electricity turned off a few times for nonpayment , Unal says .
Nonetheless , he thwarts his accountant and attorney ’s advice to declare bankruptcy since doing so would mean he would lose the Centurion .
Unal asked her friend why he continues to pay the pricey annual fee since he does not take advantage of the card ’s travel perks .
“ He said it was worth it for him to get good treatment at the valet or a bar , ” she says .
“ It ’s really sad that at this point in his life he does n’t think better of himself . ”
Make the wait staff fawn over you
Other cardholders ’ friends get a kick out of the over - the - top service the card can elicit .
Donna
Wheeler ’s friend owns a Centurion , but only because her husband works for American Express , not because she ’s a high roller .
Wheeler says the power of the card is evident in restaurants , where the wait staff may be mediocre until the card is handed over with the bill .
“ Then they are fawning over us , saying , ‘ Oh , I hope you had a good visit ! ’
We just look at each other across the table and crack up laughing , ” she says .
Charm works really well to get upgrades , but in these cases I got the perks before I demonstrated my charm .
— Edward Ip
Owner , IUG Business Solutions
When charm fails , flash the card
Edward
Ip , owner of IT consulting firm IUG Business Solutions , is another cardholder who prefers to be discreet .
“ The people the card attracts are not the people you want to attract , ” he says .
“ Your close friends know who you are and what you do so they ’re not surprised or shocked to see it . ”
That said , “ It is a great way to get the bartender ’s attention . ”
Ip says that his card can be credited with the bottle of champagne that was once sent to his table the first time he visited the famed New York restaurant 21 Club , as well as an upgrade at a Beverly Hills hotel .
“ Charm works really well to get upgrades , but in these cases I got the perks before I demonstrated my charm , ” Ip says .
Personal life goal : Black Card invitation
John Mahdessian , owner of Madame Paulette , a high - end fabric cleaning service in New York , has had the card since 1999 .
He says that he sought out the card by intentionally charging $ 1 million on his AmEx that year with the sole aim to be invited .
Mahdessian says that the card exudes the type of status that he aims for .
“ I ’m the most eligible bachelor with a spotless reputation , ” says the 44 - year - old New Yorker .
“ I like to use it to impress the ladies , and they certainly are very inquisitive about it .
I think that it shows that you are not only responsible with your money , but that you have arrived financially in your life and in your career . ”
The Black Card as a pickup tool
Not all ladies are automatically impressed by the Black Card .
Liz Grimes encountered one while waitressing while in college .
She waited on a couple in their 20s who came in for lunch .
They were low - key and friendly and after chatting with Grimes for a while , the guy handed over his Black Card to pay the bill .
Grimes and her colleagues were impressed .
“ We were all wondering how someone so young could have possibly gotten their hands on one of these .
Was it his parents ?
Maybe his job ? ” she recalls .
Imagine her surprise when she picked up the signed receipt to find a $ 30 tip on a $ 30 bill — and a phone number , smiley face and note which read , “ Call me . ”
“ My friends insisted that I call him for the pure fact that he paid with the Black Card , ” Grimes says .
She refused .
“ Just because this guy obviously had money I was not going to sacrifice my morals and get involved in this situation . ”
Or , as John Mahdessian says : “ Just because you charge $ 1 million does n’t mean you have $ 1 million . ”

The Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations on Thursday that would establish a $ 50 fee for individuals who apply for a preparer tax identification number .
Proposed regulations that were issued by the IRS in March would require certain tax return preparers to obtain a PTIN ( see IRS Proposes Regulations on Preparer ID Numbers ) .
The IRS said it is still working to finalize those proposed regulations , which are the first of a series of steps planned to increase oversight of federal tax return preparation .
The proposed regulations ( REG - 139343-08 ) would establish a fee of $ 50 , payable to the IRS , to cover technology costs , as well as compliance and outreach efforts associated with the new PTIN program .
The proposed regulations would also provide for an additional fee ( expected to be substantially lower than $ 50 ) to be charged by the third - party vendor chosen to operate the new online system .
That fee amount is expected to be announced soon , as well as additional details about the launch of a new online application system .
The fees could change in future years as program costs are reevaluated , the IRS cautioned .
Agencies are directed by the Office of Management and Budget to charge user fees to recover the cost of services that convey special benefits beyond those available to the general public , such as the authority to prepare federal tax returns for compensation .
Tax professionals and other interested parties have until Aug. 23 , 2010 , to submit comments regarding the proposed regulations .
The official publication date of the proposed regulations is July 23 .

PRINT Aftermath Global Housing Bubble
Sometimes the complexity of the world is a ruse , and seeing the overwhelming future of our fortunes is strangely simple .
Our past and future credit crisis is but one case in point .
Remember when fear and failure wrecked markets wising up to the fallout of debt given to anybody for anything , but especially for buying houses ?
Naturally our financial leaders around the world took the radical steps required to reduce the debt created in a massive credit bubble .
Oh , sorry , that was my fantasy world I was talking about .
What our leaders are doing is correcting a severe cyclical recession .
What our reporters are doing is covering a severe cyclical recession .
This is sublime kabuki theater .
Back in the real world , the destruction of debt required to cure a credit bubble has n’t been done .
That means the reason for the new credit crisis is no different than during that past time of fear and failure – except that now we have new malignant clusters of sovereign debt serving as a sort of hand - held fan covering the unclothed emperor .
***
There is a prism I use to see the world .
It is in houses .
Look immediately above to see housing prices acting strangely in many advanced economies ( “ Real House Prices , 1997 - 2008 ” — a global housing - bubble chart ) .
Let me tell you what I see when I look at this :
We had one wicked housing bubble in the United States , but apparently we were the conservatives .
It looks like the funner countries are Ireland , Britain , Spain , Sweden , France , Norway , Denmark and Italy .
And while we are on the subject of debt , is there any comparison between the excess use of debt to buy mortgages and the use of debt to buy companies and commercial real estate and credit - card receivables .
What are the futures of these debt assets ?
Did they have any kind of a bubble like mortgages ?
I also wonder about the sovereign debts ?
A strange case ( Or is it a new - normal case ? ) is the residential mortgage market in the United States .
Look immediately above .
Values of the equity asset ( the home ) have fallen more than 30 percent , but the values of the debt asset ( mortgages ) used to buy the equity asset ( homes ) have fallen two percent .
Both of these investments have a right to title to the same asset , but one has fallen FIFTEEN TIMES further than the other .
Is this the real world or is it make believe ?
***
While it ’s possible that this anomaly may hold , the 14 percent of residential mortgage borrowers who are now behind points toward the debt mortgage balances and the equity home values moving closer to each other .
That ’s a complicated way of saying that mortgage balances logically should fall in value in a ratio similar to the fall in value of the house asset itself .
We know that the fall in property values is real and we know that the United States bubble in values was far greater than any bubble of the last 120 years ( See chart above and pay close attention to the amazing “ X ” bubble . ) .
Thus now do you see the pattern of Armageddon gathering force and deciding when and where to explode and paint a picture of gore all across the world .
The American market in housing went off the deep end .
A flood of negative equity now invades our land .
Foreclosures in progress are at a record .
Yet look yonder to strange and distant shores .
Look at Italy and Denmark and Norway and France and Sweden and Spain and Great Britain and Ireland ( Please see the chart below : “ Real House Prices ( Change 2000 - 06 ) ” ) .
Their real estate market got bubbled worse than ours .
Just when you think it ’s impossible for dishonesty to be taken to the next level in the American housing market , you see a chart like this one ( “ Foreclosed Homes on the Market ” ) , which , if true , means that bank - owned properties are being held like abandoned castles and that the next level of dishonesty has been achieved .
The chart shows huge numbers of bank - owned properties lying hidden in your local bank ’s burka .
The banks own the properties , but they do n’t sell the properties ; probably because the loss is too great for the bank .
I had always assumed that the shadow inventory was just bungling bankers failing to stay on top of their foreclosure cases .
I did n’t think of the sale of a foreclosure as a banker chugging boiling poison and embracing death .
The bankers have a nice PR line out there saying that the collateral takers are simply waiting for the market to turn so they can reap greater rewards when they sell their foreclosures .
Then I saw this chart and realized that I had been taken for a fool .
I said to myself : “ If I owned a bank and my bank would go out of business if I sold my foreclosure collateral , would I just hold it then to live for another day ? ”
The answer was obvious :
Yes , I would just hold it like an old abandoned castle .
Shame on me for believing the bankers waiting for the market to turn back around .
Are you telling me there is a banker in the world that would n’t sell collateral now and today if the price worked ?
***
It takes me aback .
Our housing market is a true obstacle course for an honest thinker .
The federal government is making every mortgage loan to forestall radical crashing , and our local banks are pretending to solvency by going into the castle business — holding foreclosures as either investments or tchotchkes or as prayer beads .
My suggestion therefore is that you look in to the John Paulson subprime - mortgage trade .
Read up on what that was all about .
See if there is some form of echo housing - bust credit - crisis high - multiple sovereign - credit - default derivative which you can use to really get the chance to do it big this time .
This is the best trade ever .
It ’s easy .
It ’s obvious .
It ’s real .
The center cannot hold .
America is a bubble , and no plan has been suggested to kill the bubble debt .
The world is a bigger bubble , but nobody has a plan for a global debt - destruction project .
It ’s not even on the agenda .
It ’s like the whole world has turned Japanese ( Yes , I really think so . ) .
We , and the world , and debt from mania , will break .
Hell will rule then , but only for an extended period .
And what if we do n’t break that debt in two ?
Then we will enjoy a Malthusian stumbling impoverishing zomby - ish period for about as long as forever is .
Do n’t believe me ?
Ask the kamikaze people .
They know what it ’s like to work side - by - side with a crushing credit - bubble balance sheet .
The kamikaze people are , of course , the Japanese .
The ghosts of the Japanese treasury issued the following statement :
***
“ In our experience deleveraging is a fantasy in the aftermath of an extreme credit bubble .
Now we know that and we watch as the world pretends we do n’t exist .
You simply must ask the right question after a crash .
You have to determine the likelihood of deleveraging .
Is it logical that bubble debts issued to buy bubble assets will be paid back when bubble assets lose their bubble value ?
“ The obvious answer in our case was ‘ no ’ .
The mania was too extreme .
The debt is too extreme .
Which leads to the next logical step .
What should we have done ?
We should have taken a massive write - off .
“ It was our job to declare bankruptcy .
We should have forced banks and insurance companies to convert debt to equity on a grand scale .
We should have destroyed the equity investments of millions of people and thousands of companies .
We did n’t .
We are still waiting to do what we should have done .
What appeared to be especially cruel then we know now would have been smart , courageous , and humane .
We know our wealth today would be much greater .
We know our debt today would be much less .
If we had taken radical action in the early nineties , our economy would be leading the world right now .
Instead we lied about the solution .
We lied about mania .
We failed to admit our failure .
“ Now we fight a monster .
Our hands are tied behind our back .
Every year the catastrophe gets worse .
And if you use the word ‘ stimulus ’ among us , we will show you our beautiful perfect streets , immaculate trains , perfect infrastructure , paved with blood and sweat , with diamonds and gold , and made from sovereign debt , which we amassed by borrowing from our own people .
“ Remember this .
Mark our words .
We ca n’t be helped you ridiculous fools . ”

Recently by Gary North : A $ 600 + Billion Spending Cut
The phrase “ Tea Party ” is synonymous these days with the politics of spending cuts .
The big one is the compulsory health insurance law .
Tea Party people want it repealed .
Yet in the grand scheme of things fiscal , that law is a drop in the tea cup .
In my previous report , “ A $ 600 + Billion Spending Cut , ” I suggested a sure - fire way to cut a big chunk of spending out of government budgets : local , state , and federal .
Stop funding all education .
The typical voter reads this and thinks : “ But that would end all progress . ”
There is no constituency for such an across - the - board spending cut .
The Tea Party has not recommended it .
There are other cuts possible — much larger cuts : end both Social Security and Medicare .
Same response , only louder .
This is why Keynesianism is always popular with a majority of voters .
Voters have accepted the Keynesian premise : government spending is a productive thing .
So , in a financial crisis , there is never any effective resistance to new emergency spending programs .
On the other hand , there is well - organized resistance by favored special - interest groups against cutting existing programs at all times ,
This process is the basis of the government ’s spending ratchet .
Spending by the national government keeps increasing .
So does the national debt .
Yet this acceptance of ever - more Federal spending may be changing , as economists say , “ on the margin ” — or as politicians say , “ on the fringe . ”
The Tea Party movement is the indication of a change of opinion .
THE DREAM OF A MAGICAL FIX
The Tea Party gets a lot of media attention these days .
Two Republican Party primaries on June 8 got coverage because of victories by Tea Party candidates : South Carolina and Nevada .
This coverage cheers me .
My first recorded vote was for Barry Goldwater in 1964 .
I read John T. Flynn ’s book , The Roosevelt Myth , at age 16 in 1958 .
I know about deficit spending .
I know this : it is popular politically .
Why ?
Because it is a way to defer spending cuts .
The voters really do believe that something will turn up , so that they will not have to pay off the Federal debt .
They do n’t know what , but something .
So does Congress .
To make tax cuts for higher income voters without making unpopular spending cuts is the dream of Republican politicians .
To make tax cuts for the middle class — the working poor pay only Social Security ’s FICA tax — without making unpopular spending cuts is the dream of Democrat politicians .
In the Reagan era , the President tried to achieve this by promising rising revenues as a result of reductions in the income tax rates in all brackets .
Unfortunately , he neglected to veto any major spending bills that were placed on his desk by Congress .
The economy also got hit by a major recession in 1981 — 82 as a result of a slowdown in Federal Reserve inflation .
In 1983 , the Federal deficit went above $ 200 billion .
Also in 1983 , Social Security technically went bankrupt .
The President assembled the Greenspan Commission , which recommended FICA tax hikes .
The President signed a law implementing the Commission ’s recommendations .
In 1986 , the President signed another tax increase , called TEFRA .
The deficit increased anyway .
What Reagan faced was piddling compared to what Obama faces .
The Federal deficit is obviously out of control .
This means that Federal spending is out of control .
Do we have legitimate hope that spending will be brought under control in time to avoid a crisis in the capital markets ?
No .
I see how far down the road that the West has traveled when it comes to debt : government debt , corporate debt , and household debt .
I look at the zones of modern life that have become dependent on ever - larger quantities of government debt .
Then I look at which programs Tea Party politicians say they will vote to cut .
Well , “ look at ” is not quite correct .
“ Look for ” is more like it .
NON - SHOPPING LISTS
Let ’s see their non-shopping lists .
Let ’s see what cuts the Tea Party candidates will recommend .
Put differently , let ’s see which entrenched constituencies for government subsidies they are willing to write off .
Let ’s see which cuts will be so substantial — enough to balance the Federal budget , let alone run a surplus — that their very advocacy in public will bring out voters to support the candidates the Democrats run .
The Democrats are not political fools .
They know how their bread is buttered . . . and where .
So do the Establishment Republicans .
All that the Democrats ’ candidates need to say is this : “ Where do you intend to cut Federal spending ?
Be specific .
Publish this as a campaign document .
How do you intend to reduce the deficit ? ”
The Tea Party candidate is the equivalent of the dude who is dressed in his best East Coast wardrobe , who steps out of an Arizona stagecoach in a 1948 Western .
The guys sitting around the saloon spot their mark .
“ Let ’s have a little fun with the dude ! ”
They pull out their six - guns .
They start shooting at the dude ’s feet .
“ Dance , dude ! ”
The dude dances , unless he ’s Gregory Peck .
We are going to find out this fall how many Tea Party candidates there are whose role model is Gregory Peck .
Unlike the 1948 Western , we will get to see if Mr. Peck is gunned down 20 minutes into the movie , with the rest of the film devoted to the final takeover of the county by Charles Bickford .
OVER THE CLIFF
Three things are driving the West ’s economy toward a cliff : government debt , bank leverage , and fiat money .
The increase in national government debt since early 2008 is unprecedented .
This is because , in a recession , politicians vote for bailouts , which increase the government ’s deficit .
Meanwhile , central banks buy assets of any kind in order to flood the economy with newly created fiat money , thereby saving the banking system .
This two - fold policy response — deficits and fiat money — is promoted by all schools of economics except Austrianism .
The school of economics that is most prominent today , and which gets good media publicity for promoting the two - fold policy response , is Keynesianism .
Members of the other schools of thought meekly ratify what the Keynesians promote openly , mumbling that “ there is no other choice in this crisis . ”
The Austrians protest , but until 2008 , hardly anyone paid any attention to them or their protest .
Keynesianism ’s solution to recessions is always the same : to have the national government borrow money that would have been lent to the private sector .
The theory is that when governments spend borrowed money , this increases economic growth , because the government spends the money rather than private producers and borrowers .
The Keynesian system rests on two unstated assumptions , which are illogical and therefore never stated plainly for the public to see .
Government spending of borrowed money that supports unemployed workers or funds corporate bailouts is economically productive and will restore economic growth and end the recession .
Private sector spending of borrowed money enables consumers to buy what they want and also enables businesses to purchase capital goods , labor , and raw materials in order to produce consumer goods and services .
This is economically wasteful and extends the recession .
When I state it this way , a normal person thinks : “ This makes no sense .
Why should government borrowing to pay people not to work and also to pay for government bailouts be productive , while allowing consumers and producers to choose their own level of debt is destructive ? ”
So , non-Austrian School economists never go into print with the two assumptions .
As well - paid designers of fine new wardrobes for emperors , they prefer not to let voters inside the weaving room .
The Austrians ’ policy recommendations are part of a four - point program .
First , governments should cut spending enough to produce a fiscal surplus , despite major tax cuts .
Second , governments should cease borrowing .
Third , the central bank should cease buying assets .
The Austrian camp is divided on point four : whether the budget surplus should be used to pay down the national debt , or whether the money should be returned to taxpayers , accompanied by an outright default on the national debt .
How popular with politicians is this agenda ?
It is n’t .
How popular is it with voters ?
Not very , especially when a crisis in the stock market is taking place , and over - indebted banks and corporations are going bankrupt .
No politician has ever run on this platform : “ Abolish the FDIC ! ”
The FDIC guarantees the bailout of depositors , up to $ 250,000 per bank .
It also guarantees that the money supply will never shrink because of failing banks , the way it did in the United States , 1930 — 33 , when about 9,000 banks went bust — but no large bank .
Large banks had the support of the Federal Reserve System .
Voters love the FDIC .
There are well - organized permanent political constituencies for the latest designs of clothing for emperors .
There are hundreds of millions of believers in the wisdom of emperors .
This is why non-Austrian School economists always have good jobs .
This is also why Austrian School economists are relegated to the fringes : websites and podcasts .
They are ignored by newspapers and network TV .
They are especially kept out of university economics departments .
Nobody in academia wants to let an Austrian School economist get close to impressionable children , who have perceptive eyes and who might call out something embarrassing from the sidelines in the middle of the big parade .
RUNNING OUT OF TIME
The idea that the debt markets are running out of time is now gaining attention .
This is the first time in my lifetime that this idea has penetrated the consciousness of the general public .
It is still being denied by the chattering class .
Non-Austrian School pundits are still fervently repeating the Party Line , to wit :
The debt of the United States government is essentially risk - less .
A 90 - day U.S. Treasury bill is the closest thing in history to a risk - free investment .
This debt is AAA - rated , and should be .
There is no possibility that Asian central banks will ever cease buying U.S. Treasury debt , let alone sell their existing portfolios .
Asian manufacturers cannot possibly do without American consumers .
This is why Asian central banks buy U.S. Treasury debt by inflating their own domestic currencies : to hold down interest rates in the United States , thereby enabling American consumers to borrow money to buy Asian goods , rather than letting Asians buy these goods .
American consumers are vital to Asia .
Asian consumers are not .
Thus it has always been .
Thus it will always be .
With the Greek government ’s announcement on April 23 of the threat of non-payment of its debt , the Party Line has met a growing skepticism .
It is possible for a Western government to default .
The non-response of the Northern European politicians for two weeks was followed by a frantic weekend announcement of a bailout worth $ 900 billion .
This was not the response of politicians who are in control .
It was a Hank Paulson “ the sky is falling ” performance .
The acronym of the busted budget nations — PIIGS — was surely one of the more delightful aspects of these recent events .
The PIIGS ’s politicians and bankers resent this , but they cannot do anything about it .
The mental image of pigs with their snouts in a trough is made to order for skeptics of the Party Line .
Serious analysts are beginning to waffle on the Party Line .
There is no full - scale revolt within what we can accurately identify as the Davos - Bilderberg axis , but there are people who serve as advisors to people inside this axis who are raising doubts in public .
The most notable is the Harvard University / Harvard Business School professor of financial history , Niall Ferguson .
His May 13 lecture to the Peterson Institute for International Economics , “ Fiscal Crises and Imperial Collapses , ” is by far the most persuasive of recent efforts .
Read it here .
Ferguson has compared the U.S. fiscal crisis to the fiscal crisis of the Ottoman Empire in 1875 .
In mid-December , 2009 , he published a paper , “ An Empire at Risk . ”
His assessment is both accurate and relevant .
. . .
This is how empires decline .
It begins with a debt explosion .
It ends with an inexorable reduction in the resources available for the Army , Navy , and Air Force .
Which is why voters are right to worry about America ’s debt crisis .
According to a recent Rasmussen report , 42 percent of Americans now say that cutting the deficit in half by the end of the president ’s first term should be the administration ’s most important task — significantly more than the 24 percent who see health - care reform as the No. 1 priority .
But cutting the deficit in half is simply not enough .
If the United States does n’t come up soon with a credible plan to restore the federal budget to balance over the next five to 10 years , the danger is very real that a debt crisis could lead to a major weakening of American power .
The precedents are certainly there .
Habsburg Spain defaulted on all or part of its debt 14 times between 1557 and 1696 and also succumbed to inflation due to a surfeit of New World silver .
Prerevolutionary France was spending 62 percent of royal revenue on debt service by 1788 .
The Ottoman Empire went the same way : interest payments and amortization rose from 15 percent of the budget in 1860 to 50 percent in 1875 .
And do n’t forget the last great English - speaking empire .
By the interwar years , interest payments were consuming 44 percent of the British budget , making it intensely difficult to rearm in the face of a new German threat .
Call it the fatal arithmetic of imperial decline .
Without radical fiscal reform , it could apply to America next .
This sort of talk was beyond the fringe in 2007 .
It was far outside the bounds of acceptable discourse within the Davos - Bilderberg axis .
It remains a fringe idea , but inside the circle , not outside .
As this idea spreads , it will penetrate into the highest level of the Peoples Bank of China and the Bank of Japan .
When it does , the scenario sketched by Ferguson will be perceived as valid .
Then there will be a change of central bank policy — there and here .
CONCLUSION
The Tea Party ’s main function today is to bring to the average voter a sense that Ferguson ’s scenario is no longer crackpot .
This will not lead to budget cuts .
It will not lead to tax cuts .
But it will produce voters who will say — after Ferguson ’s scenario has come to pass — “ never again . ”
Gregory Peck will be gunned down , but Charles Bickford ’s empire will not survive the financial cataclysm .
We will see who picks up the pieces , county by county .

The At War blog is following reaction to the release of an archive of classified military documents described here that paints a grim portrait of the war in Afghanistan .
The New York Times had access to the documents and published a series of reports .
A note to readers describes The Times ’s process of reviewing the documents and deciding what to publish .
Editors and reporters who worked on the articles are answering questions about the material in Talk to the Newsroom .
E-mail your questions to askthetimes@nytimes.com and post a comment below .
James Morin , a former captain in the United States Army who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan , questions whether the leak will have a chilling affect on candor among U.S. troops in a post on Room for Debate .
Leaks like those at the heart of the Pentagon Papers , play a role in a democracy when national civilian and military leaders mislead the country deliberately about the challenges faced .
What we see in these documents , however , largely demonstrates the absence of such a need .
Instead , we are left with the harmful aspects of classified leaks – a chilling lack of confidence and internal candor .
Going forward , a battalion - level intelligence officer may hesitate to pass on what her instinct tells her to be marginally credible information ( after all , even the best source is not always right ) .
She may start to wonder , “ Do I really want to see this pop up on WikiLeaks or run in a 10 - second spot on the evening news ? ” when she is debating whether the rumor is worth sending up to the next echelon .
Ultimately , such concerns will damage the ability of our institutions to fully understand the diplomatic and security landscape before them .
Stephen Farrell rounded up a sampling of reaction on military blogs .
In Threat Matrix , the blog of The Long War Journal , Bill Roggio writes : “ Longtime readers of The Long War Journal will not be shocked by these reports .
For years , Tom Joscelyn and I have been documenting the involvement of the Pakistani military and intelligence services with various terror groups . ”
He said he and his colleague would “ have more to come on these and other subjects as we sift through the documents . ”
On the Small Wars Journal , Rex Brynen said the documents appeared to bear out years of reporting from the war , but provided Afghan insurgents with a detailed picture of the Americans ’ files on them .
“ They seem more like the anti-Pentagon Papers , since they reveal that the official and media portrait of the war has been — within the confines of OPSEC , the normal political spin , and the fog of war — accurate .
There are , so far , no big surprises or scandals .
“ As to the intelligence and war - fighting consequences of the leak , it provides the Taliban with unparalleled information on what ISAF knows , does n’t know , and often how it knows it too .
It ’s likely to have a chilling effect on intelligence cooperation and sharing too , within and across governments . ”
Other reader echoed a theme perhaps unsurprising on military - focused blogs – anger at the unauthorized release of secret documents .
“ Where in the hell was the C.I.A.?
Wikileaks was known to be in possession of classified material in violation of U.S. and NATO country laws well before this release .
They should have been stopped before what is probably the largest release of classified material during a war in history .
Can you imagine what would have happened during WWII or even the “ cold war ” if something like this had occurred ? ”
And in a pointed exchange
gian p gentile :
“ Rex : Agree ; Like the Pentagon papers , but not really .
I would only add to your points about this historical reference that another key difference is the general apathy of the American public toward the war in Afghanistan compared to the moral connection between the American people and war during Vietnam because of the draft .
“ Unlike the Pentagon Papers that resonated months and years and even beyond after they were released , these wikileaks on Afghanistan will be front page for a day or two then swept into the dustbin of history where the only folks interested will be wonks , experts , historians doing current history , and military bloggers . ”
Tom :
“ Gian ….. and other groups that will be interested , Taliban / AQ ! ”
Abu Muqawama theorizes about the proliferation of new , Internet - based , media driving the news agenda but also addresses a key issue beyond the who , where , when and what happened in the leaked documents .
Will it change anything ?
In Wikileaks ’ Afghanistan adventure he writes :
“ I ’ve noticed on my Twitter account that opinion on the information contained in the leaked Afghanistan documents obtained and released by Wikileaks varies between “ yeah , we knew that .
So ? ” to “ Oh my God ! ” “ I think there is much more to this whole episode than whether or not you knew civilians were being killed in Afghanistan and former ISI officials were giving advice to insurgents in Afghanistan .
This is about public opinion .
Measuring what the public thinks and predicting how it might react to events is an imprecise science ( much like the related fields of economics and sociology ) .
But it ’s still very real . ”
He concludes :
“ What makes any difference here is whether any of this changes anything .
Does public opinion get swayed ?
Do politicians feel the need to react ?
Do insurgents find a sense of justification for their actions ( or fall in support when they screw up ) ?
The answer to all of these questions is yes . ”
“ So the response here is n’t , ‘ Yeah , whatever , we know this . ’ or ‘ OMG !
Why did no one tell me ?!’
The question to ask is how the information is being digested . ”
On Antiwar.com Justin Raimondo takes a step back from the detail in Bradley Manning ’s Gift and says that , at first glance , it is the overall impression that is so damaging .
“ What ’s particularly bad , from the perspective of the Obama administration officials charged with selling this war to the American people , is the dramatic portrayal of the sheer chaos enveloping our military effort …
Oh , and by the way , the Taliban is apparently armed with portable heat - seeking missiles – a fact the administration has been covering up . ”
As he fielded questions on the WikiLeaks disclosures , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs seemed at times to contradict himself , particularly when fielding questions on the relationship between Pakistan ’s spy agency and Afghan insurgents .
Nothing is new in the reports , he suggested , while adding that Pakistan was fully cooperating with the United States and NATO in combating the Taliban and militant groups operating in its borders .
“ I do n’t know that what is being said or what is being reported is n’t something that has n’t been discussed fairly publicly , again , by named U.S. officials and in many news stories .
I mean , The New York Times had a story on this topic in March of 2009 written by the same authors . ”
When asked what exactly the United States is getting for its continuing aid to Pakistan and whether the administration was certain that the ISI was no longer aiding insurgents , he said , “ Nobody ’s here to declare mission accomplished .
You ’ve not heard that phrase uttered or emitted by us as a way of saying that everything is going well . ”
The press secretary stressed that Pakistan ’s domestic government had made progress in recent months and noted that the documents did not include any developments since December 2009 .
Earlier today , our colleague Janie Lorber wrote : “ the question looms large : Are these the Pentagon Papers of our time ? ” Richard Tofel , the general manager of ProPublica , the investigative Web site , says the answer is , “ Not quite . ”
In a blog post he writes :
The greatest similarity between the Wikileaks trove and the Pentagon Papers is that the documents end before the current administration ’s policy began .
In political terms , that is hugely important .
The Pentagon Papers , of course , were a secret study , commissioned during the Lyndon Johnson administration by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara .
The period under study ended in 1968 , and the Papers were not made public until 1971 .
Johnson left office in 1969 , and was succeeded by a president of the opposing party , Richard Nixon .
Nixon promised a shift in Vietnam policy , and while his policy did not differ as much in practice as he had hinted that it would while campaigning , he was not held responsible , by most voters , for the deepening mess of the Johnson years .
In the current case , as the White House has repeatedly pointed out in the last 18 hours , the papers end before President Obama ’s announcement last year of an Afghanistan policy that departed from that of President Bush .
( That policy , of course , has centered on significantly increasing the number of troops , and focusing more on counter - insurgency . )
In terms of important disclosures , it ’s not even close , with the historical importance of today ’s documents likely to be relatively minor , and that of the Pentagon Papers enormous .
The Afghan war documents , Mr. Tofel argues , merely reiterate or add detail to previously reported suspicions and facts .
“ In 1971 , in contrast , ” he writes , “ the Pentagon Papers revealed a host of important discrepancies between the public posture of the U.S. government with respect to Vietnam and the truth — from the Truman administration , through the times of Presidents Eisenhower , Kennedy and Johnson . ”
As several observers have noted , the revelation that American soldiers suspect that Pakistan ’s intelligence service , the ISI , is sponsoring the Taliban , is not new in itself .
Steve Coll — the author of “ Ghost Wars : The Secret History of the C.I.A. , Afghanistan , and Bin Laden , from the Soviet Invasion to September 10 , 2001 ” — explained very clearly in an interview with PBS last year , any talks on a final settlement to the war in Afghanistan will have to please not just the Taliban and the Afghan government , but also the men who run Pakistan ’s military and intelligence services as well .
In Mr. Coll ’s words :
The Taliban ’s bid for national power in Afghanistan is inseparable from their historical relationship with the Pakistani security services .
Even today , the Taliban in Afghanistan are taking direction from leaders who are almost certainly living in Pakistani cities , may very well be known to the Pakistani security .
And why is the government of Pakistan — our ally — possibly tolerating the presence of these Afghan Taliban ?
Because they ’re not certain about where Afghanistan is going .
They see the Taliban as a potential hedge against their enemies in Afghanistan , so they ’re sort of sitting on their hands .
This could not be a more complicated war .
If you think about it , the United States is essentially waging a proxy war against its own ally .
The Taliban are a proxy of the government of Pakistan .
We are an ally of the government of Pakistan .
We are fighting the Taliban .
In the end , the Taliban will be defeated strategically when the government of Pakistan makes a strategic decision that its future does not lie in partnership with Islamic extremists .
The German magazine Der Spiegel has published an English translation of one of its articles on the leaked released documents , “ The Helpless Germans . ”
According to the magazine :
The war logs obtained by WikiLeaks depict a situation in northern Afghanistan that is far worse than it is depicted in the reports German Chancellor Angela Merkel gives to parliament .
They also show even though the German armed forces , the Bundeswehr , have been present since 2002 , they have made little progress in Afghanistan .
A Guardian live blog tracking reaction to the release of the documents notes that their Berlin correspondent , Kate Connolly reports :
The German government said today it planned to investigate the leaked US military documents amid concern that the information disclosed might put its troops in danger .
Foreign minister Guido Westerwelle called for the information to be closely scrutinized .
‘ All of it must of course be carefully examined , to see what possible new revelations there might be , ’ he said , speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels .
In a series of interviews , Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , explained and defended his organization ’s decision to publish tens of thousands of classified Afghan war documents .
In an interview with Der Spiegel , which was one of the three news organizations that had access to the documents before their release on Sunday , he said :
These files are the most comprehensive description of a war to be published during the course of a war — in other words , at a time when they still have a chance of doing some good .
They cover more than 90,000 different incidents , together with precise geographical locations .
They cover the small and the large .
A single body of information , they eclipse all that has been previously said about Afghanistan .
They will change our perspective on not only the war in Afghanistan , but on all modern wars . [… ]
This material shines light on the everyday brutality and squalor of war .
The archive will change public opinion and it will change the opinion of people in positions of political and diplomatic influence .
On Monday , Britain ’s Channel 4 News published the complete video of an interview with Mr. Assange , in which he said , “ There does n’t seem to be an equivalent disclosure made during the course of the war when it might have some effect .
The nearest equivalent is perhaps the Pentagon Papers released by Daniel Ellsberg in the 1970s , which was about 10,000 papers — but that was already four years old when it was released . ”
In June The New Yorker published a profile of Mr. Assange by Raffi Khatchadourian .
Adam B. Ellick and Salman Masood report from Islamabad :
A senior ISI official , speaking on condition of anonymity under standard practice , sharply condemned the reports as “ part of the malicious campaign to malign the spy organization ” and said the ISI would “ continue to eradicate the menace of terrorism with or without the help of the West . ”
Expressing dismay over the reports , the official said the Pakistan military and its spy organization had suffered tremendously while leading the forefront of the war against terror .
“ Pakistan is the biggest victim of terrorism , ” he said .
“ Why then are we still targeted ? ” he asked .
Calling the reports raw , uncorroborated and unverified , the official said : “ In the field of intelligence , any piece of data has to be corroborated , analyzed and substantiated by multiple sources .
Until then it remains raw data , and it can be anything . ”
Farhatullah Babar , the spokesman for President Asif Ali Zardari , dismissed the reports and said that Pakistan remained “ a part of a strategic alliance of the United States in the fight against terrorism . ”
He continued : “ Such allegations have been regurgitated in the past .
Also , these represent low - level intelligence reports and do not represent a convincing smoking gun .
I do not see any convincing evidence . ”
Mr. Babar questioned how Pakistan could possibly have the kind of connections to the Taliban that some of the reports suggest , asking if “ those who are alleging that Pakistan is playing a double game are also asserting that President Zardari is presiding over an apparatus that is coordinating attacks on the general headquarters , mosques , shrines , schools and killing Pakistani citizens ? ”
He continued , “ There was a time when many people believed that former President Musharraf was running with the hare and hunting with the hound , ” he said , suggesting that any such double - dealing lay with the president ’s predecessor and nemesis .
“ We believe that era is over . ” Pakistani newspapers touched only briefly on the documents .
Dawn.com , the Web site of the country ’s most prestigious daily , carried an Associated Press report in which an ISI official denied the allegations aimed at the spy organization .
The Express Tribune , a daily newspaper from Karachi , noted that American officials had held long - standing concerns about ISI links to the Taliban , though its report led with the government ’s condemnation of the leak .
Popular Pakistani blogs had nothing on the WikiLeaks trove by Monday afternoon .
Bina Shah , a novelist based in Karachi , wrote on Twitter : “ Why is nobody in Pakistan discussing the WikiLeaks story ?
It ’s sensational . ”
In what could be the one of the most serious cases of civilian casualties in nine years of war , top Afghan officials said Monday that 52 people had been killed in a remote region of Helmand Province on Friday when a rocket slammed into a house where women and children had gathered to take shelter from fighting between NATO troops and militants , Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Taimoor Shah report .
Maj .
Michael Johnson , a spokesman for ISAF , said that an assessment team was in the area investigating the incident .
If confirmed , the incident would be the worst civilian casualty toll since a NATO airstrike in Kunduz called in by German forces in September 2009 .
Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , which posted tens of thousands of classified military reports on the Afghan war online on Sunday , spoke to journalists about his work at the Frontline Club in London on Monday .
Embedded below is video of Mr. Assange ’s news conference posted on Ustream .
Here is the first part of the news conference :
Here is the second part of the news conference :
Mujib Mashal , an employee in The Times ’s Kabul bureau , rounds up some of the initial reaction to the reports on the document release .
Afghanpaper , an online news and opinion source , focused on the Pakistani intelligence service ’s reported links with the Taliban :
“ The documents indicate that Pakistan , a strong ally of the United States , allows its intelligence officers to directly meet with the Taliban .
In such meetings , the plans for fighting American soldiers , and even plots for the assassination of Afghan leaders , are discussed .
Obviously , such reports have become ordinary and mundane to us .
But what is noteworthy is the fact that U.S. officials have condemned the leaking of such information .
General Jones , the National Security Adviser , tried to show that America has good relations with Pakistan and decried the leakage .
Pakistan , too , seems uncomfortable with the leak , as its ambassador to Washington tried to play down the documents , saying they “ do not reflect current on - ground realities . ”
Afghanpaper goes on to say that the documents , despite not carrying any groundbreaking information , do reveal some clues about controversial issues in the war .
“ The documents might not contain any seriously surprising information , since Afghans have grown accustomed to such reports .
But they will definitely provide clues and answers to questions regarding the various kinds of military operations , the assassination of Afghan leaders , circumstances of civilian killings , political games with government figures etc . ”
Azadi Radio , in a Web site article entitled “ Pakistan is Deceiving the United States by Secretly Supporting the Taliban , ” also focuses on the Pakistani intelligence agency ’s ties , and how it undermines the war effort .
The piece is an exposition of the Times ’s article on the Pakistani spy service and the United States government ’s reaction to it .
Ava Press , an online news source , focuses on the extent of information that the documents provide on civilian casualties .
The piece quotes a human rights activist as saying :
“ These documents pull the veil from the secrecy with which Americans and NATO have been dealing with the incidents of civilian casualties .
Despite our repeated calls , most of the cases in civilian casualties never underwent a thorough investigation by the authorities .
These documents show what lies behind the secrecy that we have decried for a long time now . ”
Weesa Daily also focuses on the civilian casualties and points to the leaks ’ critical timing — when investigations into recent events are in progress .
“ These documents are leaked at a crucial time when NATO forces are investigating last week ’s airstrike in Helmand that killed 45 civilians . ”
Andrew Sullivan asks the question that many At War readers have asked since the War Logs report was published .
What do we really learn from the Wikileaks monster - doc - dump ?
I think the actual answer is : not much that we did n’t already know .
But it ’s extremely depressing – and rivetingly explicit – confirmation of what anyone with eyes and ears could have told you for years .
We already know the following :
The notion that a professional military and especially police force can be constructed and trained by the West to advance the interests of a “ national government ” in Kabul within any time frame short of a few decades of colonialism is a fantasy .
We are fighting a war as much against the intelligence services of Pakistan as we are the Taliban .
They are a seamless part of the same whole , and until Pakistan is transformed ( about as likely as Afghanistan ) , we will be fighting with two hands tied behind our backs .
This is the Taliban ’s country .
Fighting them on their own ground , when they can appear in disguise , can terrify residents by night if not by day , and fight and then melt away into the netherworld of mountains and valleys is all but impossible .
And as the occupation fails to secure popular support ( and after ten years and a deeply corrupt government in Kabul , who can blame the Afghans ? ) , the counter - insurgency model becomes even less plausible than it was before .
Adrian Lamo , the former hacker who turned in Pvt. Bradley Manning , the soldier arrested on suspicion of handing secret video and military secrets to Wikileaks , said Private Manning could not have acted alone in the latest release of some 92,000 documents .
“ I do not believe that Private Manning had the technical expertise necessary to communicate this amount information to the outside world without being detected on his own , ” he said in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News .
“ And I do n’t believe he operated without guidance , rather I think it ’s more likely that he was a personal shopper for classified data for the Wikileaks apparatus , ” he said .
“ It has harmed what is most important to our intelligence community and that is our ability to trust the people we put out there to do critical and sensitive jobs , ” Mr. Lamo said in the interview .
Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul , who ran Pakistan ’s spy service , the ISI , from 1987 to 1989 , a time when Pakistani spies and the C.I.A. joined forces to run guns and money to Afghan militias who were battling Soviet troops in Afghanistan , denied allegations in The Times ’s report on documents that appeared to show ties between the ISI and insurgents .
“ Report of my physical involvement with al Qaeda or Taliban in planning attacks on American forces is completely baseless , ” Mr. Gul said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal .
“ I am not against America , but I am opposed to what the American forces are doing in Afghanistan . ”
Mr. Gul , who now lives in a high - security neighborhood in Rawalpindi , which is also the headquarters of the Pakistan army , told the Journal : “ I am their favorite whipping boy and it is not the first time that such a allegations are made against me . ”
He said , “ It is almost two decades since I am retired from the ISI , but they keep accusing me for everything . ”
Julian Assange answered questions about the documents at the Frontline Club in London .
He defended the release of the information and encouraged reporters and the public to examine the documents for themselves .
He focused on the number of civilian casualties cited in the documents and said there is evidence of “ war crimes ” throughout the reports .
The complete news conference is available on the Frontline Club ’s Web site and posted above in our 11:29 update
Our colleague Richard A. Oppel Jr. reports from Kabul that the initial reactions of the Afghan media were not ones of shock or awe .
What the documents revealed about Pakistan did not surprise anyone in Kabul .
Asked whether there was anything in the leaked documents that angered the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , or which he thought was unfair , his spokesman , Waheed Omar , said in brief comments after a press conference in Kabul Monday afternoon : “ No , I do n’t think so . ”
“ Most of it was about civilian casualties and efforts to hide civilian casualties , and the role of a certain intelligence agency in Afghanistan , ” he said , referring to Pakistan ’s Directorate of Inter - Services Intelligence , or ISI , “ and the president ’s initial reaction was , ‘ Look , this is nothing new . ’ ”
“ Of course , ” Mr. Omar said , “ it is going to add to the awareness in the world about both of these issues , but there was nothing surprising in this . ”
The Washington Post notes how WikiLeaks ’ decision to let The New York Times and two European news outlets have access to the classified reports “ reflects the growing strength and sophistication of the small nonprofit Web site . ”
Senator John Kerry , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said the documents released by WikiLeaks raised serious issues about the U.S. ’s handling of the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
“ However illegally these documents came to light , they raise serious questions about the reality of America ’s policy toward Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Those policies are at a critical stage and these documents may very well underscore the stakes and make the calibrations needed to get the policy right more urgent . ”
The White House e-mailed the following statement with the subject line “ Thoughts on Wikileaks ” to reporters on Sunday evening .
In the memo , the White House advised journalists on possible reporting tacks to take on the documents and pointed them to an excerpt from The Guardian newspaper ’s report :
You all should have received a written statement from General Jones [ see update below ] about the wikileaks release .
Please let me know if you did n’t .
A few thoughts about these stories on background : 1 ) I do n’t think anyone who follows this issue will find it surprising that there are concerns about ISI and safe havens in Pakistan .
In fact , we ’ve said as much repeatedly and on the record .
Attached please find a document with some relevant quotes from senior USG officials .
2 ) The period of time covered in these documents ( January 2004 - December 2009 ) is before the President announced his new strategy .
Some of the disconcerting things reported are exactly why the President ordered a three month policy review and a change in strategy .
3 ) Note the interesting graphs ( pasted below ) from the Guardian ’s wikileaks story .
I think they help put these documents in context .
4 ) As you report on this issue , it ’s worth noting that wikileaks is not an objective news outlet but rather an organization that opposes US policy in Afghanistan .
The White House official then quoted from an article by Declan Walsh of the Guardian , who wrote :
But for all their eye - popping details , the intelligence files , which are mostly collated by junior officers relying on informants and Afghan officials , fail to provide a convincing smoking gun for ISI complicity .
Most of the reports are vague , filled with incongruent detail , or crudely fabricated .
The same characters — famous Taliban commanders , well - known ISI officials — and scenarios repeatedly pop up .
And few of the events predicted in the reports subsequently occurred .
Mr. Walsh also reported that a retired senior American officer told him that ground - level reports were considered to be a mixture of rumors and “ second - hand information ” which was weeded out as information was passed up the chain of command .
“ As someone who had to sift through thousands of these reports , I can say that the chances of finding any real information are pretty slim , ” the officer , who has years of experience in the region , told Mr. Walsh .
Mr. Walsh added , in a passage quoted by the White House official , “ If anything , the jumble of allegations highlights the perils of collecting accurate intelligence in a complex arena where all sides have an interest in distorting the truth . ”
The memo also provided excerpts of comments that President Obama has made on issues addressed in the documents .
The White House released the following statement , condemning the disclosure of classified information :
Statement of National Security Adviser Gen. James Jones on Wikileaks
The United States strongly condemns the disclosure of classified information by individuals and organizations which could put the lives of Americans and our partners at risk , and threaten our national security .
Wikileaks made no effort to contact us about these documents – the United States government learned from news organizations that these documents would be posted .
These irresponsible leaks will not impact our ongoing commitment to deepen our partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan ; to defeat our common enemies ; and to support the aspirations of the Afghan and Pakistani people .
The documents posted by Wikileaks reportedly cover a period of time from January 2004 to December 2009 .
On December 1 , 2009 , President Obama announced a new strategy with a substantial increase in resources for Afghanistan , and increased focus on al Qaeda and Taliban safe - havens in Pakistan , precisely because of the grave situation that had developed over several years .
This shift in strategy addressed challenges in Afghanistan that were the subject of an exhaustive policy review last fall .
We know that serious challenges lie ahead , but if Afghanistan is permitted to slide backwards , we will again face a threat from violent extremist groups like al Qaeda who will have more space to plot and train .
That is why we are now focused on breaking the Taliban ’s momentum and building Afghan capacity so that the Afghan government can begin to assume responsibility for its future .
The United States remains committed to a strong , stable , and prosperous Afghanistan .
Since 2009 , the United States and Pakistan have deepened our important bilateral partnership .
Counter - terrorism cooperation has led to significant blows against al Qaeda ’s leadership .
The Pakistani military has gone on the offensive in Swat and South Waziristan , at great cost to the Pakistani military and people .
The United States and Pakistan have also commenced a Strategic Dialogue , which has expanded cooperation on issues ranging from security to economic development .
Pakistan and Afghanistan have also improved their bilateral ties , most recently through the completion of a Transit - Trade Agreement .
Yet the Pakistani government – and Pakistan ’s military and intelligence services – must continue their strategic shift against insurgent groups .
The balance must shift decisively against al Qaeda and its extremist allies .
U.S. support for Pakistan will continue to be focused on building Pakistani capacity to root out violent extremist groups , while supporting the aspirations of the Pakistani people .
As our colleagues report , a six - year archive of classified military documents to be made public online Sunday by an organization called WikiLeaks offers a picture of the war in Afghanistan that is in many respect more grim than the official portrayal .
The New York Times ,
The Guardian newspaper in London and the German magazine Der Spiegel were given access to the records , which illustrate why , after the United Sates has spent almost $ 300 billion on the war in Afghanistan , the Taliban are stronger than at any time since 2001 .
The latest posting from WikiLeaks is its first publication of classified military information since its release in April of a video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters that killed a dozen people in Baghdad , including two Reuters news staff .
Some of the findings in The Times ’s analysis of the trove of documents released Sunday include :
* Americans fighting the war in Afghanistan have long harbored strong suspicions that Pakistan ’s military spy service guides the Afghan insurgency that fights American troops , even as Pakistan receives more than $ 1 billion in U.S. aid .
* The C.I.A. ’s paramilitary operations are expanding in Afghanistan .
* The Taliban has used portable , heat - seeking missiles against Western aircraft — weapons that helped defeat the Soviet occupation in the 1980s .
A note to readers describes the The Times ’s process of piecing together the documents and deciding what to publish .

Martin Walsh writes :
One of my favourite examples of linguistic innovation in Tanzania was the rapid transformation in 1996 of a politician ’s name into a term of ridicule in Swahili .
Ramadhani Kihiyo became CCM MP for Temeke constituency in Dar es Salaam ( aka ‘ Bongo ’ ) in the first multi-party general elections in October 1995 .
But his election was challenged , and in the subsequent petition hearing it emerged that he had lied about his academic qualifications ( there ’s a nice summary of these proceedings in Tanzanian Affairs , No.55 ) .
Kihiyo resigned his seat at the end of May 1996 , and his name became a byword for fake certificates and invented resumés .
I remember this well because it was the running joke among my travelling companions ( government officials and a driver from Dar ) when I was visiting villages in Pawaga , in Iringa District , in September 1996 .
‘ Fulani ana kihiyo ’ , and the plural form ‘ Fulani ana vihiyo ’ , ‘ So - and - so has bogus qualifications ’ , was the expression I heard in endless variations and hilarious applications as we drove along the dusty dry - season roads .
As this became widespread usage in the country it was said that people who shared Kihiyo ’s Sambaa name were dropping it to avoid its unfortunate associations and the embarrassment thus caused .
Fortunately for them , time has since begun to erase memories of the Kihiyo scandal , and many Tanzanians do n’t know what a kihiyo is , though the practice it refers to is all - too familiar .
A quick search of the internet produces a few examples , all of them using kihiyo as a term for the person with the invented qualifications ( e.g. ‘ huyo kihiyo ! ’ , ‘ that faker ! ’ ) rather than the made - up achievements ( paper or otherwise ) themselves .
The only other example of eponymy in Swahili that I can think of was coined during the Lewinsky scandal in 1998 , when US President Bill Clinton ’s extra-marital relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky was a major international news story .
Among at least some urban Tanzanians kumk ( i) linton mtu , ‘ to “ clinton ” someone ’ , is now a jocular euphemism for fellatio , kunyonya ( lit. ‘ sucking ’ ) in everyday Swahili .
If this was an English expression you ’d expect it to be a reference to whatever the president did to his young intern .
But as Clinton told the courts , he did n’t really do anything , and the Swahili slang refers to the act that Monica is alleged to have performed on him .
So while it would be correct to say that Monica “ clintoned ” Bill ( Monica alimklinton Bill ) , you ca n’t use this eponymous verb to say that he had “ clintoned ” her – or indeed any other woman .
It is possible , however , for one man to “ clinton ” another , linguistically - speaking that is .
It ’s perhaps no coincidence that these two examples of contemporary eponymy derive from political scandals and the prominence given to them in the newly - liberalised Tanzanian media .
But the first seems not to have stuck and I do n’t know how widely used or understood the second is , beyond the circle of Zanzibari women and Bongo dwellers that I ’ve heard it from .
I ca n’t imagine seeing the likes of ‘ kihiyo , n. vi-’ or ‘ k ( i) linton , v. ’ in a printed Swahili dictionary anytime soon , but would love to be proved wrong .

David Cameron is eager to show that he can break with the past and chart new avenues – what with the coalition with the Liberal Democrats and talk of the " big society " reversing decades of centralised government power .
But as he heads to India accompanied by a cricket squad of ministers and businessmen , he would do well to read up on a bit of history – and in particular , on the letter that Queen Elizabeth I gave to John Newbery , one of the first Englishmen to visit India .
Dated February 1583 , it was addressed : " To the most invincible and most mighty Prince , Lord Zelabdim Echebar , King of Cambaia ; Invincible Emperor , etc . "
The letter explained that Elizabeth 's countrymen liked to trade , that they thought this would be of mutual benefit , and that they were willing to travel great distances for this purpose .
The letter went on to speak of the Indian Emperor 's " humanity " , and of how the English Queen would be " greatly beholden " if he would treat her subjects " honestly " and grant them " such privileges as to you shall seem good " .
Elizabeth was not well informed about India .
She had the wrong name for the Indian monarch and was mistaken about his title .
He was Jalaluddin Akbar , one of the great Mughal Emperors , whose domain extended far beyond " Cambaia " .
For good measure , she also misspelled the name of this port in modern - day Gujarat , on the west coast of India – it was , in fact , Cambay – though she could have claimed some kind of credit , if only because it was along the town 's waterfront that , 130 years later , British sailors first introduced cricket to the Indians .
What gives the letter real contemporary relevance , however , is that – like Newbery – Cameron and co are going to India to trade .
And while Britain is no longer quite the small island threatened by Spain , then Europe 's most powerful kingdom , its present economic woes do make it much more of a supplicant – all the more so , as India is convinced it is on its way to regaining its old 16th - century economic domination .
Then , the Mughals could realistically have expected to be described as one of the world 's great powers – and for the next century and a half , it was India , along with China , that dominated global trade .
Even in 1750 , 167 years after Elizabeth 's begging letter , India had 24.5 per cent of the world 's manufacturing output – with China leading the field with 32.8 per cent while the United Kingdom was barely visible with 1.9 per cent .
It was another seven years before Robert Clive 's decisive victory over the Nawab of Bengal on the banks of the Bhagirathi River at Plassey converted the British from traders to rulers and changed everything .
Modern India has still some way to go to regain its once - lofty position but it is growing at over 8 per cent a year , and the recession that haunts the West is for most of its people just a series of media images from another part of the world .
India has had no need to bail out its banks or adjust to an age of austerity .
True , as in the 16th century , vast inequalities of wealth remain – with just under half the population of 1.2 billion living on less than $ 2 a day .
But a thriving middle class of 400 million people is constantly seeking to lift an economy already ranked 11th in the world .
And in marked contrast to the ageing societies of China , Japan and Europe , the prospects for growth are further fuelled by an increasingly young population – with 70 per cent of Indians under the age of 35 .
And all this is complemented by a certain political and historical maturity .
I was made aware of this on a recent trip to the heartland of northern India .
The trip took in sites such as Nalanda , the university that dates to the fifth century BC and claims to be the oldest in the world .
It included Bodhgaya where , under an ancient Bodhi Tree , a little - known prince called Siddharta found inspiration after years of meditation and became Buddha , and Sarnath , where Buddha preached his first sermon .
At every place , the guides took pains to point out the destruction that the various invaders , many of them Muslims , had inflicted .
But almost in the next breath they went on to praise the British , who in many cases had rescued the ruins , indeed made the Indians aware of their history .
This praise extended even to Lord Curzon – who , in 1917 , told the British War Cabinet that it would take Indians 500 years to learn how to rule themselves .
His reign as viceroy ignited the first great nationalist agitation against British rule .
But he also did much to protect ancient Indian monuments .
This Indian ability to move from touchiness about the Raj to a more confident , measured view of its impact has been helped by the economic success of Indian businesses and the mark they are making on the international scene .
In the India of my childhood , hawkers in Mumbai would shout " novelty , novelty " , holding out the foreign goods we so desired but could not get .
For my generation , everything foreign was good and we could not wait to escape India .
But now Indians can see on their screens their fellow Indians emerging as giants of world business – particularly in Britain .
Lakshmi Mittal , head of the world 's biggest steelmaker , is top of the Sunday Times Rich List .
And another Indian , Anil Agarwal of the mining group Vedanta , is in the Top 10 .
Even more pleasing to Indian eyes is the Tata Group 's success .
In a country where businessmen and politicians are expected to be corrupt , the Tata name is magic .
It represents well - run businesses which know how to make money , treat their employees properly and set standards in business probity .
Tata stories are part of Indian folklore .
At the beginning of the 20th century , a member of the Tata family was refused entry to a whites - only British club in Mumbai which had a sign saying " Indians and dogs not allowed " .
The Tata response was to build the Taj Mahal hotel and put up a sign saying " British and cats not allowed " .
Apocryphal as the story may be , the Tata legend was augmented when they became the first steelmakers in India , defying the Raj official who promised to eat any steel the family produced .
As the Tatas have taken over such iconic British brands as Jaguar and paraded their Nano city car on British streets , Indians feel that the awful ghost of the East India Company , the trading entity that conquered India , has been exorcised .
This was illustrated recently when there was speculation that Anil Ambani , one of the richest men in India , might buy Liverpool football club .
There was much debate on Indian television of the merits of owing a Premier League club .
One participant suggested it was payback time to the British for the East India Company .
The presenter cut in sharply , saying : " We paid them back a long time ago .
I thought the Indians owned most of the British businesses worth having .
We do n't need to buy a football club to demonstrate that . "
The rest of the panel roared with laughter , showing the confidence of modern India and how it views its old imperial master .
It should be noted that it is an attitude further shaped by the fact that Britain , after 200 years of dominance , is no longer the only foreign power that counts .
The Indian leadership , led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , that Cameron will meet in Delhi is still largely English - educated .
Singh is a Cambridge graduate who was tutored by Sir Alan Walters , Mrs Thatcher 's economics guru .
But Singh is now 77 and his generation is on its way out .
A younger generation mainly educated in the US is waiting to take over .
It includes Jyotiraditya Scindia , the 39 - year - old minister of state for commerce and industry , and Sachin Pilot , the 32 - year - old minister of state for communications and technology .
Scindia is of the royal family of Gwalior which , during the Raj , would not have been allowed to deal with a foreign power except with British blessing ; now he brings to Delhi the skills he acquired at Harvard and Stanford .
For his part , Pilot went to Pennsylvania .
The 39 - year - old Rahul Gandhi , who is being groomed to take over from Singh , was educated at Cambridge but also at Rollins College , Florida – a fact that would have been anathema to his great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru .
A product of Harrow and Cambridge , Nehru used to rile his British jailers by singing Harrow school songs .
After becoming free India 's first Prime Minister he maintained the British connection .
He accepted pleas from Churchill and Attlee that India should remain in the Commonwealth , overturning the long - standing policy of his Congress party that India should leave .
While he kept secret his affair with Lady Mountbatten , wife of the last Viceroy Lord Mountbatten , he looked forward to his airmailed copy of the weekly New Statesman and loved visiting London .
By contrast , he distrusted America and made no secret of his desire to limit American influence in India .
Some Indians still have a schizophrenic attitude to the United States , summed up by Prannoy Roy , who runs NDTV , India 's most - successful news channel .
" We Indians love to say , ' America leave – but take us with you . ' "
But this is changing due to the presence of a large and successful Indian diaspora in America .
It has also been helped by Pakistan , long regarded as America 's " client " in the region , now being seen as a failed state .
All this has moved India closer to America and , the Communists apart , most Indian leaders are now keen to make up for half a century of neglect .
An interesting illustration of the American influence is in the launch of the Indian Premier League – the Twenty20 cricket competition known as the IPL – and is well summed up in the story of Lalit Modi , the man who created it but has since been drummed out of the game for alleged misdeeds .
Modi has both a US degree and a US conviction .
In 1985 , while still at university , he was convicted of abduction and possessing cocaine .
He escaped jail on a plea bargain , agreeing to five years of probation and 100 hours of community service – and once he had graduated , he persuaded an American court to let him return to India on health grounds .
While the English had invented Twenty20 cricket but done nothing much with it , Modi , making the most of India unexpectedly winning the first Twenty20 World Cup , launched the IPL in the spring of 2008 .
The name IPL may echo the title of the English football 's Premier League but many of Modi 's ideas , such as creating city - based sports franchises , were borrowed from American sports .
At IPL matches , Modi introduced blonde pom-pom girls , who gyrate every time a four or a six is hit – celebrations familiar to American followers of sport but never before seen in cricket .
The IPL emphasised that India is the powerhouse of cricket , providing 80 per cent of the world game 's income , thus allowing Modi to sell the television rights for over $ 1.6 bn .
It also underlined that when it comes to ideas , these days India looks to America .
Even Modi's subsequent fall from grace had an Americanised feel to it .
Under investigation for tax evasion , money laundering , bogus offshore companies and sweetheart deals , Modi's IPL gave the impression of having operated in a manner similar to the way that business was run in unregulated 19th - century America – with no corporate governance and any deal , however dubious , permissible .
Ironically , Modi 's problems came about because of his clash with another Indian high flyer who has spent much of his life in America .
This was Shashi Tharoor , who was educated in the US and then worked for the UN for nearly 30 years , just missing out on becoming Secretary General to the South Korean Ban Ki-moon .
Last year Tharoor was parachuted in to contest the safe Kerala seat of Thiruvananthapuram and was made a minister of state in the Foreign Office .
Evidently , the Congress leader Sonia Gandhi saw him as the sort of man to be part of the coterie around her son Rahul , when he takes over as Prime Minister .
But Modi's tweeting about Tharoor 's involvement with a franchise in Kochi , a coastal town in Kerala , raised questions about the minister 's judgement and forced his resignation .
For good measure , the Indian Prime Minister was in the White House when the story exploded and had to take time off from meeting President Obama to deal with it .

The first stop for any rider coming down from the Tour de France podium is in front of the microphone brandished by French television presenter Gérard Holtz .
During his post - stage interviews in Pau , the effervescent Holtz received a bonus when race leader Alberto Contador and second - placed Andy Schleck reached his position at almost the same time .
This allowed the Spaniard to state publicly his apology for events on the Port de Balès , when Schleck ’s mechanical mishap resulted in Contador taking the race lead from the irate Luxembourger , who is , coincidentally , one of his close friends .
Holtz had just started his interview with Contador , by asking him for his thoughts on a stage that started fiercely for the yellow jersey group and ended up rather tamely for them …
Alberto Contador :
It was certainly a hard stage .
Right from the second kilometre of the stage there were only 14 riders in the peloton .
Gérard Holtz :
There were whistles on the podium .
Did it shock you to hear that ?
AC : No , I can respect why …
GH : Hang on , sorry for interrupting you , but we ’ve got another guest here .
Andy , can you sit down ?
Alberto ?
AC : We are very good friends and we ca n’t let that friendship be ruined by what has happened .
GH : Andy , what do you think when you hear Alberto say that ?
Andy Schleck :
We did speak to each other today .
What we all saw yesterday was not something that you want to see in a race , but sometimes things like that do happen .
Alberto said to me that it was simply something that ’s part of racing .
I told him that it ’s all fine now .
The Tour de France is going to be won by the rider with the best legs , and there is certainly going to be a great battle between the two of us the day after tomorrow .
GH ( referring to the video that Contador posted on Youtube in the evening after stage 15 ) : Alberto , is it true that you apologised to Andy ?
AC : Yes .
I did n’t need to .
But we ’ve got a very strong friendship and it was for that reason that I wanted to apologise yesterday evening .
AS : I realise that after what happened at Spa the race could already have been over for me .
That day the peloton waited for me .
Yesterday the situation was n’t the same , and I realised that I should n’t fret about it too much .
GH : You ’re like now two boxers preparing for the final rounds on the last Pyrenean stage and also in the final time trial .
AS : Yes , eight second is nothing at all .
GH : Laurent Fignon and Greg LeMond know that all too well …
AS : In the final week of the Tour de France eight seconds between him and me is nothing at all .
I think that the Tour will be decided on the Tourmalet and that the first one to the summit will be the man who wins the Tour de France .
GH : Can you also tell those members of the public who have been jeering Alberto that they should stop because once again today there was a scene that was disrespectful of all those who love cycling …
AS : Yes , er …
GH : Can you say it directly into that camera ?
AS ( looking directly into the camera ) : Everyone stop that !
Do it for me .
GH : That ’s good to hear because I think it is right to respect the yellow jersey and also to respect great champions .
AC : I just want to say many , many thanks for that my friend .
GH : Thank you to both of you champions .
The Core Data Programming Guide clearly states that Core Data is not a database but since both Core Data and a database are ways of providing searchable , persistent storage , exactly how and why they are different may not be clear .
In this post , I 'll look at the way Core Data works and the reasons why its features and capabilities are different to those of common SQL databases — even though an SQL database may be used as the backing store .
Introduction
Both Core Data and an SQL database provide a means of persistently storing structured data in a searchable store .
Since programmers are generally familiar with databases and since Core Data is actually backed by an SQLite database , it is understandable that Core Data is often treated and used as though it were a wrapper around SQLite .
It is important to realize that although you can use Core Data in this way ( in fact , it works very well like this ) , that Core Data actually operates over a different domain to SQLite — meaning that it provides lots of services that SQLite does n't but also that Core Data can't provide some of the services that SQLite can .
Even for services that both technologies provide , there are different performance considerations .
Primary function of a database
The somewhat narrow description of database that I will use is : persistent and searchable storage for data in table , row , column format where the primary goal is to keep the data up - to - date on disk at all times , with a secondary goal of powerful , focussed , narrow fetching and updating capabilities .
There are lots of database implementations and many provide features far beyond this description but I 'm really looking at the key components of a straightforward SQLite - style database implementation with which many programmers are familiar .
Despite many databases being called " relational " ( which implies that they have a degree of support for object connectivity ) , SQLite and many other relational databases do n't handle the mechanics of connecting objects ; maintaining state ( like a an object relation ) between columns , rows or tables is left to the user of the database .
In this sense , a database is " dumb " storage — rows have few behaviors beyond " read " and " write " and extending or customizing their behavior would involve extending the database system itself .
Even when triggers are available , their programmatic capabilities are limited .
Primary function of Core Data
At its heart , Core Data is an object graph manager with lifecycle , searching and persistence features .
In the case of Core Data , object graph management includes :
You can connect object A to object B and the connection at both the A and B ends is kept perpetually in sync .
If you change the connection at the A end , the B end will be updated and all changes trigger notifications ( to which you can attach arbitrary code )
Deletion of objects at one end of a connection can trigger cascading deletion or nullify responses .
The other end of a connection can exist out of memory ( faulted ) unless the connection is actually followed at which time the connected object is loaded .
Unlike a typical database , Core Data can be used totally in -memory .
While Core Data is often called a " object persistence " framework ( since it is expected that you will use its persistence features ) , it is actually possible to use Core Data entirely in - memory without any form of persistence .
Of course , once you have data , it is reasonable to want to keep that data , so persistence is treated as a major feature of the framework but it is important to know that persistence is not mandatory .
Also unlike a database , it is possible to use Core Data without any form of searching .
If you allocate and connect all your objects , all you need to do is hold onto one of them and you can walk through everything without needing a fetch request .
This search - less behavior is not because Core Data transparently performs a search : once data is loaded in memory , following a connection does not involve a search .
All Core Data objects are fully instantiated Objective - C objects that manage most of their own attributes , relationships and lifecycle .
This also means that their properties and behaviors are implemented by methods , making them both observable and overrideable .
Databases and object graph management are not inherently exclusive
While not available by default in SQLite , the " foreign key " of MySQL , and other SQL:2003 compliant databases , can handle keeping identifiers in different tables in sync and even cascade deletion when requested .
The programmatic customization abilities of overrideable objects is not available but the basics of graph management are there .
There are other object relational frameworks that work closer to Core Data 's model but which try to behave as an atomic , transactional database .
To update the object graph , these frameworks must :
load appropriate rows from a database
instantiate objects from these rows
make changes to the graph objects that are now in memory
commit the changes back to the database
To be properly atomic , these steps must all be performed as a single transaction ( with no other reads or write to the affected rows during the transaction ) .
While some systems might require this , it is far too slow for a general object graph system .
Core Data does not follow this model as Core Data aims to be a more general object management system — and that means that it needs far better performance and flexibility than this model would allow .
Operating in - memory versus an on - disk database
Without access to the source code , it 's not entirely clear .
We can only assume that the NSManagedObjectContext tracks instantiated objects in a heap or structured container of some form so that it can find them again .
This tracking structure may behave a bit like an in - memory database but it would only be for tracking the existence of instantiated objects — it is important to note that it would not itself store any data .
Also note that the centralized NSManagedObjectContext and any structures it might maintain are not how you interact with instantiated NSManaged Object s — you interact with an NSManagedObject by sending messages to NSManaged Object pointers .
The reason that Core Data focuses on an in - memory representation is speed .
For object graph changes that affect multiple objects , it is much faster if they are all in memory already , rather than needing to search for them again in the database .
For temporary objects ( data that does n't have to be saved to disk )
Core Data can create , change and manipulate objects much faster than SQLite can since SQLite has to update indexes and update nodes in the B - tree , as well as simply allocating space and setting values .
Core Data can allocate millions of objects in a few seconds , where SQLite might take a few minutes for the same number of allocations .
The tradeoff with an in - memory approach is that SQLite is still used as the backing store .
Reading from disk and saving to disk involves all of SQLite 's overheads plus the overhead of the Core Data to SQLite conversion process — so is invariably slower than SQLite alone .
Common database tasks that Core Data does n't do
I 've spoken about features that Core Data has that databases do not .
It is important to consider some of the features that Core Data 's approach lacks with respect to a database .
Core Data cannot operate on data without loading the data into memory
In SQL you can simply " DROP tableName " to delete whole tables or update every column of a table with commands like " UPDATE tableName SET key1 = value WHERE key2 = otherValue " .
These commands can efficiently update vast amounts of data because they only need to load small amounts of data into RAM at any given time .
Core Data does n't work in this perpetually on - disk manner — it only works on objects in memory .
Even if you only want to delete an object , it must be loaded and instantiated in RAM .
Of course , this is necessary because the object , and its potentially overridden behaviors must be loaded and invoked .
There are also connections to be kept up to date with other objects .
However this constraint has implications : if you 're trying to change huge numbers of objects ( tens of thousands or more ) you will need to consider keeping your memory footprint down .
This can be done by periodically refaulting unchanged values ( refreshObject : mergeChanges : ) or avoiding the fetch of an object 's data ( setIncludes Property Values : NO on NSFetchRequest ) or even saving the whole context and releasing all the objects you 're holding .
Core Data does not handle data logic
There are a few data - related features that SQL contains , a good example being " unique " keys , that Core Data does not include .
There are a couple of technical reasons why this might be the case .
Subclasses can override the getter and setter for an attribute to the point where it is unclear whether it is or is not unique .
In fact , transient Core Data attributes need not even support isEqual : .
However , I suspect the distinction is actually that Core Data offers no real support for attribute behaviors at all .
Core Data manages the " graph " ( connections ) but the data attributes are all the responsibility of the business logic in the rest of the program ; convenient as it may be , it falls outside Core Data 's conceptual domain .
Multi - threaded , multi-user scenarios
Core Data does not offer any amount of threading support .
To be fair , SQLite is single threaded too but many other databases are multi- threaded and multi-user .
Core Data has been designed for single - user environments ( running inside desktop and iPhone apps ) .
Getting rid of threading and locking makes the framework much faster and simpler to work with in its standard usage scenarios .
However , there are still situations where you will want multiple threads reading your data .
NSManagedObject s and their NSManagedObjectContext should be accessed from a single thread only .
If you need another thread working on the same data , you need to save the file and reopen using a different NSManagedObjectContext in the other thread .

Life Settlements – Life Insurance Rescue
Seems like people will figure out how to make a buck out of anything .
Lately , this includes death .
Do n't get me wrong :
Since the dawn of man a lot of people have been making a lot of money on death .
Death sells , for the reason that it is the big unavoidable .
Morticians and those who sell burial plots are getting ready to go through their biggest up cycle ever as the baby boomers start cashing it in .
And life insurance has always been a very lucrative business , though the trouble with life insurance is that you actually have to die to reap the benefit of it .
Not anymore .
Seems like some very bright people have figured out a way for you to make money on your life insurance before you die .
No , it does not involve being placed into a time machine and being teleported to some future date right after you 've been lowered into the ground where you collect on your own policy and then get zapped back to the present where you can spend it .
It does n't involve you faking your death , either .
Nope , these very bright people have figured out a way for you to make money on your own death before you die , in a way that does n't involve fraud or teleporting .
To the contrary , they will show you how to create vast amounts of cash - hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more - seemingly out of thin air without you having to do much than take a medical , signs some forms , receive the check , and then of course at some future date die at your leisure .
The one sure thing about anything this good is that it is sure to get a bunch of other folks all riled up , and indeed this strategy has of late come under some serious scrutiny with some other very bright people claiming that there are some significant and hidden downsides to the strategy .
What ?
You can't get something for nothing ?
If it is too good then it is not true ?
Somewhere between the very bright people who claim that you can make money off your death before you die , and the very bright people who claim that you can't , lies the truth .
To find that truth you must first understand the concept of a " life settlement " , and to understand that , you must understand what its immediate predecessor , the " viatical settlement " are all about .
Viatical Settlements
Let 's say that you are diagnosed with a terminal illness , such as serious cancer or AIDS , but you do n't have sufficient money for treatment or even to keep yourself comfortable until you die .
But let 's say that you do have a life insurance policy , although in such a case you 'll find that it does you pitiful little good until you do cash it in .
So , you find somebody who will buy your insurance policy now at some reduced value , knowing that very shortly they will be able to cash it in .
This gives you the money for treatments to hopefully slow the progress of your disease and also maybe keep you somewhat comfortable until you finally kick the bucket .
From the investors ' perspective , they have examined your medical records and prognosis and know with some certainty ( depending on what you have , and how bad it is ) that you are going to die within a couple of years .
When you die , the investors know that your life insurance policy will now pay them as the named beneficiaries , so they will get the money that they paid you for the policy plus some .
It is then just a simple matter of taking their total profit on the policy , and dividing it by how many years you actually live , and that is their return on their investment .
So , let 's say that you have a $ 300,000 life insurance policy , your oncologist tells you that at best you have two years to live , and so the investors pay you $ 200,000 for it and you name them the beneficiaries of the policy .
If in fact you die in two years , the investors will have made a profit of $ 100,000 split over two years , or what amounts to a $ 50,000 per year return - although this will be a pre-tax profit and income taxes will be owed on it .
Still , not bad for a $ 200,000 investment .
This type of investment in the life insurance owned by a person who is probably soon going to die ( with " soon " being somewhat arbitrarily set as being within three years ) is known as a " viatical settlement " .
In the 1980s , there was created almost overnight a multi-billion industry in investing in the life insurance policies of AIDS patients , and later this industry spread to cover terminal cancer patients and in fact nearly any other disease where sure death was a soon - to - be- realized certainty .
The fly in the ointment for investors is of course that you might outlive your physician 's prognosis , meaning that when the Angel of Death came for you at the appointed time you told him to take a hike and do n't come back until much later .
This danger , from the investors ' view , arises primarily from advances in medical technology .
What might have been sure death a couple of years ago , might become defeatable or at least put into long term remission .
Such was the case with many of the AIDS patients .
As medical technology progressed , some of the patients start living longer while with others the AIDS went into remission altogether and they are still alive .
Doubtless , there are few investors out there who have been waiting a couple of decades now to cash in on the life insurance policies that they long - ago bought , and there probably are not just a few cases where the AIDS victims have now outlived the investors in their policies .
Eventually , the same thing started happening with cancer patients who also refused to cash in their chips at the appointed time , and investors were no longer willing to take anything but the very worst cases , where no advance in medical technology was going to make a difference .
This selectivity started causing a lot of fraud in the viaticals market , as people who actually were n't very sick at all started portraying themselves at death 's doorstop and repeatedly sold policies on their own lives .
Then , some viatical fraudsters simply collected money from investors and never even invested in policies .
This and similar fraud caused the viaticals market to be viewed as very sleazy ( as if dealing in death was n't sleazy enough in the first place ) , thus inviting state regulators in to further muck up the process with red tape , and driving would - be investors out .

Life Settlements
So the viaticals mess left a multi-billion dollar business with relatively few real victims of disease to buy policies from .
But one of the great things about America is the ingenuity of our capital markets , and their ability to not just let money sit around but to put it to work .
It was just about when the viaticals markets were starting to fall apart that some very bright person looked at the situation and said ,
" Hey , what about people who are n't terminally ill , but whose health has gone down since they originally bought their policy ?
Since the insurance companies are prohibited from lowering benefits to reflect their poor health , their policies are worth a lot more than their surrender value . "
Thus was born the concept of investing in the life insurance policies of the elderly , or what is known as " life settlements " .
Assume that you have an old codger who is 65 and had a significant decline in health , such as a stroke or major heart attack ( their medical records include physician 's comments to the effect of " one foot in the grave " or " quite surprised to see him again " ) , but who once upon a time bought a $ 1 million life insurance policy .
The old codger has since raided all the cash value out of the policy to fund his medical treatments and early retirement .
Indeed , because of his age the cost of insurance is now rapidly increasing meaning that the old codger will either have to put more money into the policy or it will expire anyway .
His problem is that he does n't have any more money to put into the policy unless he borrows against the equity in his home or something , which he really does n't want to do .
Keep in mind that by this time the old codger has forgotten what he bought the life insurance for initially , which was both for tax - free growth and to leave something for his kids .
Because it no longer has cash value for him to access , and because he has forgotten that it will pay out a large amount of money to his kids if he keeps it up , it to him is a wasting asset that he would love to get rid of .
The life insurance has basically become a " What have you done for me lately " sort of investment , and thus emotionally the old codger is much more willing to hold it than , say , stock in IBM which has n't paid him much in the way of dividends but still has dramatically appreciated in value .
A quick glance at your handy pocket guide to Actuarial Tables & Life Expectancies reveals that the old codger is supposed to die , on average , within five years .
So , you go to the old codger and say , " Hey , I 'm willing to buy your life insurance policy from you for $ 500,000 paid immediately . "
From your viewpoint , this is a good investment .
If he cashes it in by 70 as predicted , then you get paid $ 1 million on the policy , meaning that you 've made $ 500,000 over 5 years ( less any premiums you have to pay to keep the policy up ) .
In round numbers , this is a $ 100,000 per year pre-tax profit on your original $ 500,000 investment .
That 20 % annual pretax return does n't look too shabby against current interest rates , and the insurance company is arguably much more solvent than any bank .
Gosh , even if the old codger lives to 75 , it 's still not a bad investment , since then you 're still making 10 % per year .
And the odds of the old codger living past 75 ( and giving your corporate bond like rates ) are somewhat offset by your hope that he will cash it in before 70 meaning that you made a wonderfully nice profit .
As an aside , most of the investors in life settlements are large financial firms and hedge funds who are looking for something that has at least the safety of high - grade corporate bonds , but with a high return ( since bond yields are still intolerably low ) .
These firms buy many , many life settlements and pool them together .
While these firms can not , of course , predict when a particular old codger will finally kick the bucket , they can employ the Law of Large Numbers to get a pretty good actuarial feel for when most of the policies will pay , thus allowing them to calculate their expected yield for the pool - and sell slices of the pool to investors looking for safe , higher yielding investments .
Who Loses With Life Settlements ?
From the old codger 's viewpoint , it is a great deal for him too .
Since he could n't afford to make current payments to keep the policy up anyway , in his mind the value of the policy was a precisely calculated " $ 0 " .
And here you come along and give him $ 500,000 hard cash for it .
Sucker !
Wait , you say , how can this " win win " situation be ?
Not everybody can be a winner in a transaction , right ?
Absolutely right .
In this situation there is a loser , and a big loser too .
It is the old codger 's kids .
Had the old codger kept the policy alive , his kids would have been big winners at his death - just like the investors will be , and even more so since unlike the investors the kids will not have to pay income taxes when the policy pays off ( although the old codger 's estate may have to pay federal estate taxes , depending on what happens with estate tax repeal ) .
In other words , if this transaction makes so much sense for the investors , it makes even more sense for the old codger 's kids .
Basically , the old codger is giving up a very valuable future asset for basically pennies now - it is simply not a good trade .
However , few of the life insurance salesmen tell their clients to engage in life settlements really work to advise their clients that it is a bad trade to settle their life insurance policy instead of keeping it alive .
To an extent , the insurance company is also a loser .
The reason has to do with what is called a policy " lapse " , meaning that the insurance company receives premiums but does not have to pay out on the policy .
Anytime a policyholder does n't keep a policy up , there is a lapse .
Suppose the old codger did not sell his policy to the investor , but simply let it lapse .
In that case , the insurance company would have collected premiums from the old codger for years , but in the end never paid out any death benefits to the old codger 's estate .
Policy lapses are sweet money for life insurance companies , and do impact their profitability .
A life insurance company can make a bunch of bad underwriting bets but still be profitable if lapse rates are high enough .
Indeed , there are some industry analysts who suggest that some life insurance companies are only profitable because of their lapse rates .
Life settlements can theoretically work to reduce lapse rates , because the investors who buy the policy will always contribute just enough money to keep it paid up until it pays off .
If enough people hear about life settlements and sell their policies before they lapse , the lapse rates would go to zero and the life insurance companies would be forced to raise rates .
This would make life insurance less competitive against other investments , and probably lead to lower sales .
But if you think that any of this causes the life insurance companies to worry , you 're wrong .
Life insurance companies know that any loss of sales due to higher premium rates will probably be more than offset by the greater sales due to people who start buying life insurance policies as investments with the thought of later selling the policies to fund retirements .
Life insurance companies had always been somewhat embarrassed by lapse rates anyway , since they tended to indicate that policies had been improperly sold in the first place .
Also , life insurance actuaries already assume that a certain number of policyholder 's will have health declines , and thus will hold their policies until their death .
From an actuary 's standpoint , the concept of life settlements in causing losses to the insurance companies is n't nearly as onerous as the insurance agents try to paint it out to be when making a sale .
Finally , the life settlements markets are limited to a relatively small part of the market since they are only for people over 65 and who have had a dramatic health change .
This group probably represents less than 0.5 % of all life insurance policies , so life settlements probably are not going to impact life insurance profitability that much .
It is , however , an argument that life insurance agents falsely use to try to portray the insurance companies as the big losers , and not the kids of those who are selling their policies .
Problems with Life Settlements
The point is that a life settlement is only a good deal for folks who have no beneficiaries or estate needs of any kind .
If you take into both family and charitable aspirations , this is a very small market .
If an old codger has heirs that he wants to benefit , or any other estate needs , then life settlements are not a suitable strategy .
Instead , the old codger should do anything he can to keep the policy going , just like the investors would do if they got it .
So , there are several significant problems with the life settlements market , and all of this discussion is just my way of meandering around to give you some background on life settlements so that we can discuss those problems .
The first problem is that some bad guys in the life settlement market cannot leave well enough alone .
Because there simply are not enough seniors who are situated like the old codger , i.e. , have a large life insurance policy that they cannot afford to keep up , these bad guys look to basically " grow " future life settlements by arranging slick - sounding deals to encourage people who do n't even have much life insurance yet to buy life insurance with the idea that later they will sell it .
With these arrangements , known as SOLI ( short for " Stranger - Owned Life Insurance " ) life insurance truly does become a pure investment with the policies grown like so many fields of corporate bonds awaiting future harvest .
SOLI is a hot topic product right now among many life insurance agents who cater to wealthy people , since they can be pitched that they can get a very high level of insurance for two years ( thus allowing the policy to mature past the noncontestability period ) , and then also make a tidy profit up front just for engaging in the transaction .
If they do n't have the money on hand to buy the life insurance policy up front , that 's still no problemo as the investors will loan them the money , subject to taking the policy after the two years in repayment of the loan .
This means basically Free Money ( !!! ) for those who allow life insurance policies to be bought on their lives .
The problem here is that this is precisely the sort of thing which can - and should - draw Congress ' attention to allowing life insurance to grow tax - free .
Why these life insurance policies are allowed a tax - free build - up is anybody 's guess , since they really are a pure investment that have little to do with protecting the family from the insured 's death .
Indeed , because of insurable interest requirements for the initial issuance of the policy , most of the people who are approached to engage in this type of transaction already have a large enough estate that they do n't need these policies to protect their families , and indeed are almost immediately cashing out of them .
In these situations , the life insurance really is no different than a corporate bond , and there really is no sensible reason that they should be taxed much differently .
What is happening is a recognition that wealthy people have a hidden asset , which is their insurability .
The bum at the bus station can't qualify for $ 5 million in life insurance , but many affluent and nearly affluent Americans can .
If somebody has an estate worth $ 5 million , then they have an insurable interest of at least that .
So why not take that unused asset and make some money off of it , right ?
Whether buying a lot of insurance makes financial sense for a person depends on a lot of factors , including their age , health , and what the internal rate of return will be .
But when it does make sense , wealthy people should be taking advantage of their large insurable interest by purchasing as much life insurance as they can reasonably afford so as to either pay estate taxes or to further grow their estate ( income tax free ) for their children .
Most wealthy people will not do this , of course , because they generally do n't like life insurance no matter how much financial sense that it makes .
What SOLI does is to turn this dislike of life insurance on its head so that wealthy people think that it is cool that they are not only making money but also selling a policy they never really wanted to these crazy investors .
But in reality it is the wealthy folks who are stupid , and the investors who are smart .
On a $ 10 million policy , a wealthy person might get $ 500,000 for selling their policy , but the investor will get $ 10 million on their death , less this $ 500,000 and any agent commissions , plus maybe a couple of million in keeping the policy going until the wealthy person kicks the bucket - at which time they might make $ 6 or $ 8 million in pure profits .
You decide who is smart and who is stupid .
If the wealthy people were really smart , they would simply buy as much life insurance as they could and hold it until their deaths .
If they did n't have the cash on hand to buy it , they could always use the services of many lenders who are willing to finance the premiums with the loans being paid out of the policy proceeds at death .
These days , many lenders are even willing to make these loans on a non-recourse basis , meaning that the policyholder is not even personally liable for the loan ( the policy is used as security for the loan until the loan is paid off at death ) .
But as discussed above , wealthy people let their dislike of life insurance ( or maybe of life insurance salesmen ) get in their way of what would be a really good investment for their families .
The Hidden Suitability Issue
This leads us to the most significant problem involving life settlements , which is suitability .
Usually , the issue of suitability relates to the agent selling a senior something which they do n't need .
Here , the suitability issues relates to the agent incorrectly advising the senior to sell something that the senior should be holding .
In many ways , it really is no different than if the senior held a Certificate of Deposit that would pay $ 10 million in ten years , and the agent came and convinced them to unload the CD now for only $ 1 million .
What the agent might argue is that the senior was cash - tight , and needed the $ 1 million now for cancer therapy .
In that very limited case , the agent 's advice might be correct .
But how about if the senior did n't even need the $ 1 million because the senior had other cash available ?
In the latter case , the senior would not be deemed to be suitable for the sale of the CD .
In fact , at a speech given May 25th at the NASD Spring Securities Conference , Mary Schapiro , the Vice Chairman and President of the NASD , stated that the NASD considers life settlements to be " securities , subject to firm supervision . "
If , as the NASD thinks , life settlements are securities then that raises a wide variety of issues , including suitability and whether the life settlement sold must be accompanied by an offering memorandum or prospectus just like any other security .
Certainly , all of this opens the door for securities litigation whenever a life settlement is sold - and perhaps most likely against the agent who acts as a de facto securities broker in encouraging the senior to sell .
In some states , such as California , one must also wonder whether so - called " senior abuse " statutes might come into play where seniors are being encouraged to sell their policies when they have the ability to continue to fund them .
What goes on in a lot of these cases is that the insurance agent who is encouraging the senior to sell his life insurance policy by way of a life settlement is then also encouraging the senior to " replace " their life insurance needs with a new policy .
While this puts the insurance agent into a wonderful double commission situation where they are making money both selling the old policy and buying the new one , it usually makes little sense .
The reason is that the insurance costs of the new policy will almost always be higher than that of the old policy , simply because the senior is now older and more importantly , much less healthy than when he bought the original policy , so he will be in a higher " risk " class .
In other words , the insurance agent is telling their senior to sell a perfectly good policy and replace it with a crappy one .
This is usually bad advice , since if the senior was really smart he would put enough money into his old policy to keep it alive , and then use whatever remaining excess liquidity that he has to buy as much more life insurance as he can afford and the underwriters will let him buy .
A must - read recent study by Deloitte Consulting LLP and the University of Connecticut discuss the typical higher insurance costs of the replacement policy , see The Life Settlements Market : An Actuarial Perspective on Consumer Economic Value , http://www.quatloos.com
/uconn_deloitte_life_settlements.pdf
This study concluded in part that at least half of the policy value will be lost by the super - high transaction costs , which exceed by many multiples the transaction cost of selling any other financial asset .
The Insurable Interest Problem
As egregious as the life insurance agent 's conduct sounds , many of them are starting to tell their seniors that they can repeat this process " every two years " which leads to the next problem , that of insurable interest .
The concept of insurable interest means that you have something worth insuring .
In addition to other things , this keeps people with nothing to lose from buying a lot of life insurance and then suddenly being found dead .
The concept of insurable interests is why the bum at the bus depot can't buy $ 5 million in life insurance , but the person with a $ 5 million estate whose heirs will need the money to pay estate taxes and other costs can .
The problem with insurable interest is that even though it grows with the wealth of the policyholder , it is still finite .
Just as one cannot buy $ 5 million in life insurance on the bum at the bus depot , one cannot buy $ 50 million in life insurance on somebody who only has a $ 5 million estate .
Yet , that is exactly what is happening with many of the life settlement deals where a portion of the money is being used to buy new policies .
What goes on to avoid the insurable interest issue is tantamount to fraud , as the insurance agents who fill out the applications either fail to disclose the existence of other insurance , or they inflate the value of the senior 's wealth .
While in the past the life insurance companies have not paid much attention to the issue , they are now redrafting their forms to pick up these instances of multiple sales of life insurance to a single senior .
A significant risk for wealthy people who engage in these transactions is that their estate could lose - big .
If a life insurance company later decides to challenge the insurable interest issue and wins , it means that the life insurance policy held by the investors has become valueless , and the investors will then sue the estate of the person for fraud and seek damages equal to what they would have made had the policy stood up .
Of course , this means the face value of the life insurance policy is much larger than the pittance that the wealthy person originally made by selling it .
The investors need not be much concerned about the insurable interest problems because for them it is a " heads I win , tails you lose " scenario .
If the policy survives an insurable interest challenge , the investors get the face value death benefit from the life insurance company and go away fat and happy .
But if the policy does n't survive an insurable interest challenge , then the investors get to sue the helpless ( because dead people can't testify in their defense ) estate for the fraud of the wealthy person who sold them the now " bogus " life insurance policy , and they can collect the face value of the life insurance policy from the estate .
From the investors ' view , this is of course another excellent advantage to dealing only with wealthy people .
The Problem with Rebating
Yet , it is not easy to get the attention of wealthy people to enter into these transactions , and they usually do n't want to take a medical examination or having people prying into their private lives , so the insurance agent must offer substantial bait .
This bait usually comes in the form of large amounts of cash paid up - front .
How much cash ?
On a $ 10 million policy , the wealthy person might get as much as $ 500,000 up front just for taking the medical examination and signing the application .
They also get " free insurance " for the two year period until the contestability period expires , and the investors feel safe in buying the policy .
Half - million bucks for a couple of hours ' work ?
Sweeeeet .
What the wealthy person is n't told is that this money is coming from the commissions paid on the life insurance policy that is sold , and thus amounts to what is called a " rebate " of commissions by the agent .
Such rebates are usually illegal , and we 've heard that some state insurance commissioners are starting to look into the practice .
While rebating is an illegal practice for the agent , it is n't necessarily illegal for the wealthy person .
However , if something happens and the policy later fails , the rebating could be great evidence of collusion between the life insurance agent and the wealthy person .
Who Ends Up Owning Your Life ?
So where do all these life settlements end up ?
Most of them end up in pools owned by large financial institutions and hedge funds .
The firms monetize the policies and sell interests in the pools to the investors , which are usually even larger investment or pension funds .
That is what happens most of the time .
There is a concern , however , that particular life settlement contracts could end up in the hands of seedy elements .
Or as Steve Leimberg of http://leimberg.com puts it , " How well would you sleep at night knowing that your life insurance policy is owned by Tony Soprano , and his rate of return will depend on how quickly you die ? "
Although having your life insurance ultimately purchased by a mobster is probably a longshot , it may not be worth the anguish to later find out that your life insurance policy that had been initially purchased by a Cayman hedge fund has since been sold to an obscure company in Colombia .
With life settlements , there simply is no guarantee who will end up owning the policy , and that might disturb some .
Indeed , the historical background of the insurable interest laws goes back to what were known as the " death pools " of Victorian England .
Then , bettors would speculate on when a particular person would die , and later started taking life insurance out on their lives without them knowing about it or giving their permission .
When later the " accidental " death rates of such persons started to rise , the English Parliament basically forbid SOLI by requiring that the purchaser of a life insurance policy have a recognizable interest in the person being insured .
By waiting the two years before buying the policy , the investors in life settlements skirt these rules but the underlying concerns are still there .
Congress and Life Insurance
Some of the life insurance companies are concerned about life settlements .
This concern has nothing to do with lapse rates or death pools , and everything to do with Congress .
Their concern is that if Congress realizes that life insurance policies are really just investments , Congress will start taxing them the same way as other investments .
Life insurance has a huge tax advantage over most other investments insofar as its value is allowed to build up tax deferred and no income or capital gains taxes are due when the life insurance policy pays off at death .
This special treatment is due to the historical use of life insurance to take care of families after the death of the breadwinner , but today it makes little sense where many life insurance policies are just ordinary investments with only the thinnest sliver of death benefit being given to get the tax - free buildup .
Congress , which is once again running huge deficits , has been eyeing the cash buildup in life insurance policies and wondering exactly why that buildup is not taxed .
Some in the life insurance industry are concerned that this whole life settlements business may precipitate the taxing of this buildup .
Some Final Thoughts
So what do you do if you have already been talked into a life settlement and then were talked into buying replacement insurance ?
You should talk with an attorney to determine whether the original sale made sense , and whether your life insurance agent fully explained to you that it might have made more financial sense to continue to fund the policy than to sell it .
You should also talk to your attorney about whether your life insurance agent explained to you that the cost of insurance might be higher with a replacement policy because you have aged .
And if you are being approached to do this transaction , you should find an attorney who is knowledgeable about it to help you to review whether it is right for you .
Life settlements are now being pitched as " free money " for wealthy people , but in reality they should only be used by people who no longer have the liquidity to keep their policies in effect .
For everybody else , the sale of the policy is probably unsuitable and the advice to sell it will often be wrong .
Those considering entering into a transaction to " grow " a life insurance policy for later sale should consider their risks of later liability to investors if the policy is successfully challenged , and demand indemnification and hold harmless agreements from the investors .
Also , they should carefully consider who might end up holding their policies , and perhaps attempt to limit the investors in their policies to strictly institutional investors .
We expect that regulators will soon jump into the life settlements markets , as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) and various state securities regulators have started looking into the issue .
As noted , the NASD has stated that it already considers life settlements to be a security and thus subject to suitability analysis .
Eventually , too , interests rates will rise thus making the rates of return on life settlements less attractive to investors .
All this will cause an eventual shake - out of the life settlements business , thus hopefully returning it to its meaningful core function which is to provide an alternative method for seniors who cannot afford to keep their policies up to gets some additional cash out of them .
In the meantime , seniors should be wary of deals that offer them quick profits for simply allowing life insurance to be placed on their lives .
They should not allow themselves to be rushed into such arrangements , but instead should take the time to carefully analyze what it is they are doing , and whether they would be better off simply buying the life insurance themselves and holding it , instead of committing themselves to selling it off after two years .
Insurance agents and financial planners should also be wary of these deals , and the potential for later being subject to discipline for advocating an arrangement which was unsuitable for their clients and subjected them to lost opportunity when their client later discovers that he would have been better off holding on to the life insurance as his estate 's own best investment .
Particularly where replacement insurance will be used , insurance agents and planners should be very careful that they explain that the true cost of insurance for the new policy will likely be higher than if their client had simply continued to fund the original policy .
It is not too difficult to envision lawsuits after the death of the senior where the family finds out that the senior had a huge amount of life insurance , but they were not beneficiaries .

One ounce of marijuana today is $ 375 .
If Californians vote for Prop 19 or if the state legislature and Governor approve AB 2254 , the price could drop to $ 38 per ounce , says the RAND Corporation in a study released today .
Called Altered State ?
Assessing How Marijuana Legalization in California Could Influence Marijuana Consumption and Public Budgets , the report examines the likely increase in usage , how much tax revenue could be generated and other issues .
One issue especially may be highly debated over the coming months .
It 's often said that legalizing marijuana will free the state from enforcing the drug .
But RAND " estimates that the cost of enforcing the current laws probably totals less than $ 300 million . "
Whether that 's true or not , it could become a focal point of the opposition .
Other findings incude the increase of usage , which could be 50 to 100 % more than now , matching the 1970s .
Despite that increase , researchers feel tax revenues will not blow away the charts .
The early reviews of Inception all praised its complexity and smart ideas , but warned it might be too smart for dumb moviegoers .
Now some people are starting to wonder if it'll make back its reported $ 200 million budget .

Science fiction writer Jason Sanford puts it right out there :
This film will be a major flop at the box office ...
My prediction is that this will be a good SF film which the critics will love , but which does n't find a large audience because of its subject matter .
Since Christopher Nolan is still Hollywood 's golden boy and is working on another Batman movie , studios will overlook losing their shirts on this film .
But that wo n't change the fact that Inception will be a flop .

Reviewers have already been comparing it to Blade Runner — and raising the possibility that it might have a similar track at the box office to Ridley Scott 's masterpiece , which only gained appreciation after it was in theaters .
And then there 's this post at Hollywood .com .
Writer Peter
Hall says that after seeing Inception , he does n't think it 's too smart for audiences .
Nolan does a great job of making his complex , head - spinning , layered ideas comprehensible .
But then he adds :
After seeing Inception , though , I had a conversation that blew my mind more than the movie did .
A friend from my old hometown was asking what I was up to .
I told him I had just gotten back from a screening of Inception .
His response ?
" What 's Inception ? "
It boggled my mind that he did n't know .
I wanted to shove his face in the trailer like he had done something wrong , like he was a pet who had gone to the bathroom on the living room rug .
Eventually once I talked him through it , once I explained that it was the new movie from the guy who made The Dark Knight and that it starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Joesph Gordon Levitt , he recalled vaguely knowing what it was , but he had no clue what it was about .
The last part did n't stand out to me - before seeing it myself I vaguely knew what it was about , but that 's because I had avoided everything since the first theatrical trailer for the film - but I was kind of stunned that someone like him , a geek who is definitely more into movies that Joe Facebook , did n't instantly register that Inception was the new movie from The Dark Knight guy starring DiCaprio .
I 'm getting a bit of a sinking feeling here .

What the employer buys on the labor market and what he gets in exchange for the wages paid is always a definite performance which he appraises according to its market price .
The customs and usages prevailing on the various sectors of the labor market do not influence the prices paid for definite quantities of specific performances .
Gross wage rates always tend toward the point at which they are equal to the price for which the increment resulting from the employment of the marginal worker can be sold on the market , due allowance being made for the price of the required materials and to originary interest on the capital needed .
In weighing the pros and cons of the hiring of workers , the employer does not ask himself what the worker gets as take - home wages .
The only relevant question for him is ,
What is the total price I have to expend for securing the services of this worker ?
In speaking of the determination of wage rates , catallactics always refers to the total price which the employer must spend for a definite quantity of work of a definite type , i.e. , to gross wage rates .
If laws or business customs force the employer to make other expenditures besides the wages he pays to the employee , the take - home wages are reduced accordingly .
Such accessory expenditures do not affect the gross rate of wages .
Their incidence falls entirely upon the wage - earner .
Their total amount reduces the height of take - home wages , i.e. , of net wage rates .
It is necessary to realize the following consequences of this state of affairs :
Enlarge By Andrew Meares , AP Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard , shown here at a debate on Sunday , assured Christians that her atheism would not interefere with church - run welfare and education programs .
CANBERRA , Australia ( AP )  New Prime Minister Julia Gillard assured Australia 's Christian majority on Thursday that her atheism would not affect government funding to church - run schools if she is re-elected .
Gillard , who was sworn in last month and promptly called elections , was the first prime minister in the federation 's 109 - year history to take an affirmation of office instead of swearing on a Bible .
FAITH & REASON : U.S. Dems :
God lobby should step up
While most Australians are Christian by birth , they are generally not devout and prefer to keep politics and religion separate .
Politicians who talk about their Christian faith are derogatorily known as " God botherers , " noted Norman Abjorensen , an Australian National University political scientist .
Still , Gillard sought to reassure voters that her faith would not affect government policies such as funding for church - run schools or churches ' tax - free status after a Roman Catholic bishop raised concerns .
Campaigning ahead of elections on Aug. 21 , she pointed to the record government funding for school building projects that the Catholic church , the largest provider of private education in Australia , had received in her tenure as education minister .
" In terms of the work that the Catholic church does that other churches and religious groups do in our society , I am a big respecter and my history has been to be a big supporter , " Gillard told reporters .
" I 've worked well and respectfully with the representatives of Catholic schools around the country ... and that 's the approach that I will continue to take as prime minister , " she added .
Gillard ousted former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , a staunch Anglican , in a coup in their center - left Labor Party last month .
Catholic Archbishop Barry Hickey , of the west coast city on Perth , told The West Australian newspaper that many Christians were concerned about the affect an atheist prime minister could have on church schools and welfare agencies .
" While there is no indication that the present prime minister will undermine the special privileges that churches enjoy , some wonder what the future will bring , " Hickey told the newspaper .
" This may well influence their vote . "
Hickey 's office on Thursday confirmed to The Associated Press he had made the comments .
Opposition leader Tony Abbott , a Catholic and a former seminarian , said Gillard 's spiritual beliefs should be irrelevant .
" Every candidate in this election should be judged on the basis of competence and policies , not personal beliefs or religious convictions , " Abbott told reporters .
Opinion polls show Labor is likely to win a second , three - year term in a close election .

Legendary Cuban folk singer Silvio Rodriguez is scheduled to perform throughout the United States this summer in his first tour here in more than 30 years .
Although Rodriguez has not been granted a visa from Washington yet , the Cuban singer - songwriter is expected to perform at Carnegie Hall in New York on June 4 , including additional concerts in Los Angeles , Chicago , San Francisco and Puerto Rico .
Granting a visa to Rodriguez , one of Cuba ’s most famous singers and supporters of the island ’s socialist revolution , is being widely seen as another step toward easing tensions between the U.S. and Cuba .
The 63 - year - old Rodriguez is a founding member of the “ Nueva Trova ” ( New Song ) movement , which fuses poetic lyrics with revolutionary politics .
For decades Rodriguez has filled auditoriums across Latin America where he is beloved .
He has released more than 20 albums in his career .
In May 2009 , Rodriguez was scheduled to make a special appearance in New York during a tribute to American folk singer Pete Seeger , at Madison Square Garden .
Rodriguez was unable to attend because Washington failed to process his visa request fast enough .
Since the historic presidential election of Barack Obama in 2008 , hopes to strengthen ties between Cuba and the U.S. have increased throughout the hemisphere .
Though political relations have not significantly improved between both nations , cultural exchanges involving artists and musicians have become more commonplace .
Last month , business and human rights groups urged Congress to work towards easing the decades - old embargo on Cuba by passing a bipartisan bill to lift a ban on travel to the island .
They also asked that certain obstacles to legal farm sales between the two countries be removed .
“ We believe the proposed legislation represents a necessary step toward ending a U.S. policy that has failed for decades to have any impact on improving human rights in Cuba , ” said Jose Miguel Vivanco , executive director with the Americas division of Human Rights Watch , during a congressional hearing .
Representative John Tanner , D - Tenn. , chairman of a trade subcommittee in the House of Representatives Ways and Means , called the hearing to examine a bill crafted by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Colin Peterson , D - Minn. , and Jerry Moran , R - Kansas .
The legislation would lift restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba and remove certain obstacles to cash agricultural sales already allowed under previous reforms .
“ Lifting these travel and trade restrictions is about what is best for the United States , ” Tanner said in a statement , adding it would create U.S. jobs through additional farm sales and help the Cuban people through increased tourism .
A study by Texas A&M University in March estimated that if the Peterson - Moran bill were approved including lifting the travel ban and easing agricultural export restrictions , the move could lead to $ 365 million in additional sales of U.S. goods and create 6,000 jobs in the U.S .
Critics say the U.S. embargo is an outdated holdover from the Cold War era that only makes matters worse for developing Cuba , which because of the blockade the Cuban people continue to lack badly - needed medical , technological and industrial resources .
In February , leaders of all 32 nations in Latin America met during a summit in Mexico and once again called on the U.S. to lift the embargo against Cuba .
The Obama administration , unlike the previous one , has taken some steps to improve relations with Havana , such as allowing unlimited family travel and remittances and greater telecommunication links .
However , many activists say , more needs to be done , and Washington must respect Cuba ’s sovereignty and political independence in the process .

But in Patch 17 , as you probably know , Blizz undid some of these Unlisted Changes .
Many of the following bug fixes were intended for internal testing only , and are now being reverted .
250 mm Strike Cannons can no longer deal damage to hidden targets .
Barracks build time decreased from 65 to 60 seconds .
Bunker build time decreased from 40 to 30 seconds .
Canceling morphing Banelings now returns 75 % of the cost like other morphing Zerg units .
Hellion range reverted from 6 to 5 .
Reaper build time decreased from 45 to 40 seconds .
Zealot build time decreased from 38 to 33 seconds .
However there were many , many more Unlisted Balance Changes that were not addressed in the notes , nor within the game .
Here they are , I confirmed these myself :
Blue changes seem likely to be intended for internal purposes only , and should probably be reverted
Green changes are likely intended to remain in the game , but have yet to appear in any patch notes
Red changes are changes they DID revert back in this patch , but were not listed in the notes
Unlisted Balance Changes that still were not reverted in the latest Patch 17 , and yet seem likely to be intended for internal testing only , and should probably be reverted :
Neural Parasite lasts about 12 - ish in - game seconds .

It 's easier to completely trap units in Force Fields .
IMO it 's pretty stupid to completely take units out of the battle so easily with a 50 energy , low tech spammable spell , especially with roaches being unable to burrow underneath .
All of the units shown in the wireframe panel are completely stuck by Force Fields :

Almost certainly not intended , the tooltip says the Cooldown is still 15
If you select a reactor barracks + tech lab barracks , they fit in the same tab , but before it separated them into 2 tabs .
Then if u wanted to build from reactor barracks you had to tab and from tech lab tab back etc .
So now since it selects both in the same tab , if you build a marauder , the tech lab builds it ; and if you build a marine , reactor builds it .
If you build 3 marines , it makes 2 in reactor and 1 in tech lab , if you build marine , marauder , marine it makes 2 in reactor and 1 in tech .

A YOUNG woman died after suffering a heart attack as she used a sex toy .
Nicola Paignton was found in bed with a vibrator by her side and a pornographic film playing on her laptop .
An inquest in Gloucester heard Nicola died from a sudden heart arrhythmia , probably brought on by her state of arousal .
Gloucestershire coroner Alan Crickmore agreed it was likely that " her activity before death " contributed to the fatal arrhythmia .
He recorded a verdict of death by natural causes .
Nicola , of Victoria Road , Cirencester , was found dead on October 15 , 2009 .
Police were called by her employer Sarah Griffiths when she did not turn up for work as a nanny .
Sarah had gone round and seen Nicola through the curtains , lying on her bed .
It was bad enough to have the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia called " Idaho " .
But leaving aside concerns as to why the organisers of the event would want it to sound like a D - day landing beach , the idea that the " T " should be silent is hugely symbolic .
A much better acronym would have been Idath , but that would have meant putting transphobia in front of homophobia .
The organisers must have decided that trans people were not important enough .
Following this trend , the tragedy of the Malawian couple sentenced to 14 years imprisonment with hard labour simply for loving each other , is now framed as a " gay rights " issue .
However , the appalling case of Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga has demonstrated just how silent the T has been rendered - and indeed the possibility that there might also be an I ( for intersex ) not even considered .
There has rightly been an international outcry in response to the couple 's barbaric treatment , but the protest has been against the perceived homophobia of Malawi 's law courts .
The problem is , however , that one half of this couple does not primarily identify as gay .
Tiwonge is most probably transgender but possibly intersex ( in many parts of Africa people do not actually have clear vocabulary to express this ) , and considers herself a woman .
Indeed she has lived " as a woman " all her life .
This situation brings to mind Milton Diamond 's important insight : " Nature loves diversity , society hates it . "
As a society we have started to learn that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality , but too many people still have problems with transgender people including , unbelievably , some gay people .
A gay male film director has recently made a transphobic film in the US , much to the dismay of the American trans community .
Being gay , lesbian or bisexual is in the west increasingly considered an acceptable and natural part of human diversity , in a way that being trans is not .
The international outcry has been against the conviction of two gay men , and I suspect the international community would be less motivated to intervene in the case of a transgender woman .
Paradoxically , the apparent media consensus that these two people are gay may help secure their release if international pressure can be maintained .
But I , for one , will not be forgetting how this story 's transgender angle appears to have been systematically suppressed – some might even say censored .
This probably stems from the fact society still does not consider trans people to be human beings .
It has been calculated that a transgender woman is murdered somewhere in the world every 53 hours .
Given the relative size of the population of transgender women who are " out " , and the fact that not all murders of trans women are known or reported , that is equivalent to at least 1.3 million cisgender women being murdered every year .
I suspect that if women were being slaughtered on that scale just for their gender it would be huge news , but when it is trans women ( and sometimes trans men ) being murdered , it is different .
In 1980 , a misguided and ignorant woman called Janice Raymond called for trans people to be " mandated out of existence " .
Despite the best efforts of murderers and transphobic journalists at erasing us , we are still here 30 years later .
Our numbers are growing rapidly and , what 's more , we are no longer willing to be silenced , misrepresented or ignored .
Please support Chimbalanga and Monjeza and ask the UK government to apply pressure on Malawi to end this farce while they are both still on this planet .

Color Cycling is a technology used “ back in the ‘ 90s ” in video games , where the colors of a particular object are shifted over time to give the appearance of animation .
This used less computing resources than actually storing and animating several frames .
It was most commonly used for things like water and fire , but later , graphic artist Mark J. Ferrari used the technique to great effect to animate snow , ocean waves , moving fog , smoke , waterfalls and more .
This technique died in the late '90s due to the rise of 3d technology and full 32 - bit color games , but it has been brought back to life by Joe Huckaby , who has implemented a full 8 - bit color cycling engine in JavaScript using the Canvas element .
But , this is n’t just a port : there is an additional feature of this engine that was n’t found back when these things were common .
That feature , Huckaby calls BlendShift Cycling .
Whereas a normal color cycling engine would simply change the colors and move on with it , Blend Shift Cycling creates a better looking effect by “ fading ” one color into the next .
As you can see in the demo , the effect looks pretty darn realistic .
If you click on Show Options , and then switch to Standard cycle mode , you can see the difference between BlendShift Cycling and Standard Cycling .
Since the canvas element is not yet hardware accelerated ( except in IE9 ) , some optimization had to be done in order to make the effect perform at the level you can see in the demo today .
Instead of looping through all 307,200 pixels every frame , the scene is pre-processed to extract an array of just the pixels that will be updated .
This optimization trick worked well as you can see , and it worked well enough that the demo runs very smoothly on an iPad or other mobile device with a decent processor as well .
Very impressive !
You can check out a blog post about the effect here , the demo showcasing scenes designed by Mark Ferrari with or without sound ( as played by the HTML5 Audio element ) , and have a read through the code here .
Impressive work !

​ A Hawaii - based marijuana minister who has for years been preaching the good news about ganja is now under federal indictment , and agents on Friday managed to persuade a federal judge that he is somehow “ too dangerous ” to be allowed out on bail .
Roger Christie , the founder of The Hawaii Cannabis Ministry ( THC Ministry ) , has been ordered held without bail after the Drug Enforcement Administration arrested him , along with 13 current or former employees and growers , on July 8 .
Christie and the others are charged with marijuana trafficking offenses related to their alleged distribution of marijuana as a sacrament at the ministry , reports Stop The Drug War
Christie had already been raided by the DEA in March , with agents “ seizing ” cash and marijuana , but not arresting him at that time .
Federal agents claim that after that raid , Christie continued his marijuana distribution at the ministry .
He and the others were secretly indicted last month .
Christie had originally been ordered held without bail , at federal prosecutors ’ request , as ordered by federal Magistrate Judge Kevin Chang .
The minister and his public defender , Matthew Winter , last week filed a motion seeking his release , citing the nonviolent nature of his offenses , Christie ’s longstanding ties with the community , his lack of a criminal record , and his willingness to abstain from marijuana use or distribution pending trial .
A federal pre-trial sentencing report also agreed that Christie should be freed on bail .
But prosecutors hit back with a 46 - page memorandum in opposition .
Claiming that Christie started back distributing marijuana after the March raids , prosecutors said that made him “ a danger to the community and … no conditions / combination of conditions could assure the safety of the community . ”
U.S. District Court Judge Alan Kay on Friday agreed with prosecutors .
Christie will now be held behind bars without bail until trial , because the gentle , pot-smoking minister is obviously “ too dangerous ” to walk around as a free man .

Atheists Break Out New Ritual Tool : The Blow - Dryer
Nonbelievers Adopt Provocative Ceremony to Make a Point About Baptism
Wielding a blow - dryer , a leading atheist conducted a mass " de - baptism " of fellow non-believers and symbolically dried up the offending waters that were sprinkled on their foreheads as young children .
At the annual American Atheists Convention , one of atheism 's premier provocateurs , Edwin Kagin , faced the crowd and raised high a hairdryer labeled " Reason and Truth . "
Said one woman who travelled from Cincinnati to undergo the de-baptism , " I was baptized Catholic .
I do n't remember any of it at all . "
The woman , Cambridge Boxterman , 24 , added , " According to my mother I screamed like a banshee , and those are her words , so you can see that even as a young child I did n't want to be baptized .
It 's not fair .
I was born atheist and they were forcing me to become Catholic . "
Kagin , who is American Atheists ' national legal director , firmly believes that regardless of one 's religious beliefs , each person has the right to say or do what he or she wants , provided it is within the law .
In the past , he has reportedly called out parents who subject their children to strict fundamentalist religious education , referring to it as child abuse .
" It is teaching children that the world works in other ways than it does , " he said .
" This can be extremely dangerous . "
" They are practicing child abuse in teaching that the world operates in ways other than it does , " he told the convention crowd .
" And in my opinion , they are engaged in terrorism by weakening our nation and our understanding of science and things with which we can defend ourselves and progress .
If it had not been for these fools we could have been at the stars 2,000 years ago . "
Kagin , author of " Baubles of Blasphemy , " has a history of behaving in ways that elicit a rise from God-fearing people .
He 's known to have asked female atheists to dress in burqas and perform a song , " Back in their Burquas Again , " he 's referred to Mary Magdalene as a deranged hooker and he 's called the Holy Eucharist " Swallow the Leader . "
Kagin said religion should not be used to determine how people ought to live their lives .
" They 're doing harm to women who want to control their own bodies and their own reproductive rights , " he said .
" They 're doing harm to a great number of people and they 're saying that ' what we 're doing is sacred and inviolate .
We can do whatever we want to your rights , and you can not react . '
That 's what they 're doing . "
Kagin : De-Baptism is ' Spiritually Cleansing '
It is in this same spirit that Kagin performs the de-baptism .
Standing at a podium wearing a long brown monk 's robe , Kagin read with the oratorical skill of a preacher from a set of pages in his hand and invited participants to come forward to be de-baptized .
He recited a few mock - Latin syllables , to the audience 's amusement .
An assistant produced a large hairdryer , labeled " Reason and Truth , " and handed it to Kagin .
The man who'd elected himself to be de-baptized stood before him .
Kagin turned on the hairdryer , blowing the hot air in his face in an attempt to symbolically dry up his baptismal waters .
" Come forward now and receive the spirit of hot air that taketh away the stigma and taketh away the remnants of the stain of baptismal water , " Kagin shouts .
Atheists poke fun at baptisms in this ceremony , saying they believe their waving around a hairdryer holds the same level of magical and spiritual powers as does the baptismal ceremony .
Kagin said that many people have undergone de-baptism .
" Many have taken it as somewhat of a joke , but some have found it truly , if you will , a spiritually cleansing experience , " he said .
Kagin has said he does n't particularly care who he 's offending with his actions , and that he is acting completely within his rights .
" You can mock anything you want because you have the right to , " he said .
" Humor is humor and what types of humor are you going to outlaw ? " he said .
He conceded that although it may not be good manners to continually take a mocking stance toward religion , " in many cases , it is the only real response . "
Kagin said he thought some people might get overly offended by his poking fun at religion .
" If someone is so secure in their faith , why are they the least bit concerned about some little atheist mocking them ? " he asked .
" I think the reason they are worried and concerned is the very deep fear that if everyone does n't believe it , maybe it is n't so . "
For Kagin , this struggle between godless and god-fearing hits very close to home : his son , Steve Kagin , is a fundamentalist minister in Kansas .
He founded Camp Quest , a secular summer camp for young nonbelievers , many of whom , he says , have been harrassed or hounded for their lack of faith .
And then there 's this interesting twist .
His own son , Steve Kagin , is a fundamentalist minister in Kansas .
Kagin said that his son claims to have a personal revelation in Jesus Christ .
" I am totally unable to say that 's not true , " he said .
" There are examples all through history of quite sane people who have had such experiences .
I do n't think it is but I 'm not going to say it is n't . "
Kagin : ' As Much Merit as the Original Baptism '
When asked if he is pained by their opposing views on this issue , Kagin chuckled .
" Oh , one wonders where they went wrong , " he said .
He and his son , Steven , have an excellent relationship , Kagin said , but they do have their limits .
" We just understand there are certain things we really can't , at this point , talk about , " he said .
" I do n't lose much sleep over [ it ] because everyone has the right to do what they want to do within the law , " he said .
" That 's what I believe in . "
As Cambridge completed her de-baptism , she expressed no qualms about how it might be perceived .
" Sometimes you 've got to have shock value , " she said .
" There 's some times where you just have to shock people into getting attention and from there , they ask questions ...
And maybe they learn a bit . "
Kagin said that he saw the conflict between atheists and believers as America 's religious civil war .
He said bad manners are a reasonable weapon in that war , but he said it was unlikely that atheists would emerge as the victors .
" Atheists have no chance whatsoever of prevailing in a direct confrontation with believers , " he said .
" There are far too many [ believers ] . "
A new method of exoplanet detection can go beyond standard measurements like mass and distance to tell us crucial details about the planet 's atmosphere .
But astronomers needed to make sure the method worked - so they tried it on Earth .
Advertisement
As it stands , telescopic observation has proven to be fantastic at finding exoplanets - we 're well into the hundreds at this point - but it's not nearly as good as telling us what the planet is actually like .
To be sure , we can figure out the planet 's mass , distance from its star , and whether it 's rocky or gaseous .
But even all that does n't really get you close to knowing whether the planet in question could support life - after all , alien astronomers many light - years away would get pretty much identical readings in those categories for Earth and Venus , and those two could n't be much more different in their ability to support life .
So what astronomers really need is a way to deduce the nature of a planet 's atmosphere using little more than the manner in which it orbits its star .
There 's a phenomenon known as stellar occultation that allows us to do exactly that .
Basically , certain elements in a planet 's atmosphere interact with the wavelengths of the star 's emitted light in very specific ways , and it 's possible to reconstruct the entire atmosphere from the addition and subtraction of these wavelengths .
This was first tested back in 2001 on the Jupiter - sized planet HD 209458 b , an artist 's conception of which you can see up top .
Advertisement
But could this method work on a much smaller , Earth - like planet ?
Astronomers decided to test this by using it to figure out one of the most complex atmospheres in the known universe - that of Earth itself .
Obviously , we can't send a telescope to another solar system to test it out on Earth , but by making measurements during a lunar eclipse they were able to closely replicate what occurs during a stellar occultation .
The test was hugely successful - the spectrograph used in the experiment was able to detect ozone , oxygen , nitrogen , and sodium using only light reflected from Earth 's atmosphere .
Obviously , it 's a very huge jump from successfully using this method on a planet you 're standing on to one tens or even hundreds of light - years away , but its ability to detect minute amounts of various elements during what the astronomers described as less than ideal conditions suggests that this really could be a powerful new tool in the search for Earth - like planets .

Bananas are among the most popular fruits for eating right out of the hand as well as incorporating into baked goods .
Recipes call for sliced bananas , mashed bananas , diced bananas , and even whole bananas , so sometimes it 's difficult to know just how many bananas you need .
Luckily , there are some simple equivalent measurements you can use to help you the next time you are buying bananas for a recipe .
But , if you are in doubt about the quantity , buy a couple of extra bananas ; you can always freeze them if they are n't needed in the recipe .
One thing to keep in mind is how big the bananas are as some recipes will reference the size , as in " two small bananas , " for example .
Small bananas are approximately 6 to 6 7/8 inches long , medium bananas are roughly 7 to 7 7/8 inches long , and large bananas are approximately 8 to 9 inches long .
Converting Pounds to Quantities
Some recipes will specify how many pounds of bananas you need , but if you are using bananas from the fruit bowl on your kitchen counter , and you do n't own a food scale , then you probably do n't know how many bananas are in a pound .
If you keep these equivalents nearby , though , you will be able to make the switch easily .
1 pound bananas = 3 medium bananas
1 pound bananas = 4 small bananas
1 pound bananas = 2 to 2 1/2 cups sliced
1 pound bananas = 1 1/3 cups mashed
1 pound dried bananas = 4 1/2 cups sliced
Converting Quantities to Cups
Whether you are making a fruit salad or a banana bread , these recipes may call for either whole bananas or the measurements in cups .
Once you get a hang of the conversions , you will feel confident with any banana recipe down the road .
1 medium banana = 2/3 cup sliced bananas
2 medium bananas = 1 cup diced bananas
3 medium bananas = 1 cup mashed bananas
2 medium bananas = 1/2 to 1 teaspoon banana extract

Substitutions
You can't make banana pudding or banana bread without bananas .
However , if you do n't care for bananas , are allergic to them , or do n't have time to run to the store , there are some substitutions you can make for bananas in recipes .
Applesauce ( store - bought or homemade ) can substitute for a banana in baked goods .
Replace one banana with 1 /2 cup of applesauce , but do n't use more than 1 cup of applesauce because the mixture will be too wet .
Egg whites ( or a whole egg ) can also substitute for a banana in some baked goods .

Canned pumpkin and silken tofu also work as substitutes for a banana in some recipes , although you may need to add sweetener , and plain yogurt might work in some recipes — but if the recipe calls for vinegar or lemon juice , choose another substitute .

Mashed cooked sweet potato works as a banana substitute in baked oatmeal recipes , and good substitutes for bananas in smoothies are canned pumpkin , mango , avocado , and frozen yogurt .
Using Bananas as Substitutes
Bananas can be used as substitutes for other ingredients in baked goods .
Vegans , in particular , are familiar with using bananas to substitute for eggs .
One ripe banana replaces one egg in a cake recipe — the banana will flavor the cake , so only use them when they complement the other ingredients .
Extra leavening may be needed .
Bananas can also be a substitute for butter and oil in recipes .
If using bananas for butter , replace in equal amounts .
You can substitute 3/ 4 cup of mashed banana for 1 cup of oil in baked goods such as muffins , cakes , and bread , but you 'll need to use a low - gluten flour and reduce the baking time .
Freezing
Keeping a supply of banana slices in the freezer means you 'll always have just the right amount of banana for baking , sauces , and smoothies — making substitutions unnecessary .
Freezing bananas is a simple process , but they should be frozen at peak ripeness .
Begin by peeling the bananas , and then cut each banana into slices that are about 3/4 - inch thick .
Spread the banana slices in a single layer on a cookie sheet ; the slices should not touch .
Freezing them this way means they wo n't all clump together , and you 'll be able to remove only as many slices as you need .
Freeze for an hour or more and transfer them to plastic bags or containers that have been labeled and dated ; then return them to the freezer .
TONY Abbott has lashed out at the government for flinching in its support of Israel , using his first major speech of the campaign to pledge fidelity to the Jewish state .
Addressing an Australia - Israel Chamber of Commerce lunch in Melbourne , Mr Abbott drew applause when he signalled that the Coalition would '' never support a one - sided UN resolution against Israel to curry favour with an anti-Israel authority ' ' .
He also suggested the government overreacted in its response to the Israeli Defence Force 's attack on an aid flotilla that killed nine activists .
" Of course the Israeli government does from time to time make mistakes , " Mr Abbott said .
" What government does n't from time to time make mistakes ?
" But Australians should appreciate that a diminished Israel diminishes the West ; it diminishes us .
And I have to say that I am a little disappointed that given the deep affinity between the Australian people and the Israeli people that the current Australian government has somewhat weakened our longstanding bipartisanship on Israel .
AUCKLAND ( Reuters ) - A drunk driver trapped after overturning his car cracked open another can of beer while he waited for emergency crews to rescue him , a New Zealand court was told .
Paul Nigel Sneddon , 47 , pleaded guilty to careless driving and drunken driving after being nearly three times over the legal alcohol limit in a district court in the city of Palmerston North , the Dominion Post newspaper reported on Wednesday .
Police found Sneddon , a former baker , trapped in his overturned Ford Laser on June 1 , drinking a can of beer after he failed to take a corner properly and crashed through a wooden barrier , flipping his vehicle .
Defense lawyer Peter Young said that when Sneddon found he could not open the doors , “ he had nothing else to do at that point , so he had another beer . ”
When asked by police how much he had consumed , Sneddon replied : “ Plenty , I ’ve been drinking for four days straight . ”
Sneddon , who is estranged from his wife , told the Wellington - based newspaper that he went on a drinking binge after losing his job at a bakery on the same day that he heard his father was diagnosed with prostate cancer .
Judge Gregory Ross fined him NZ$ 1,100 ( US$ 780 ) and disqualified him from driving for 10 months .
It was his first offence .
My wife loves bacon that 's cooked to the cusp of burning , so I 've got a good knowledge of the properties of bacon on that fine line .
It 's so brittle , you can powder it very easily .
I myself would probably just stick it in a plastic bag , and whack it a few times with a pan , but I do n't see any reason why you could n't put it in the blender .
I have a nice mortar and pestle I use for powdering things , but that 's probably overkill in this case .
Toronto FC announced Friday that they have signed forward Maicon Santos .
Santos was released earlier this week by Chivas USA .
As per team and league rules financial details were not released .
“ We are delighted to welcome Maicon on board , ” said manager , director of soccer Mo Johnston .
“ Preki knows this player inside and out , and speaks very highly of him both on and off the field .
He ’s a target man , strong , and packs a very good shot .
We are very excited . ”
Santos , 26 , joined MLS on August 21 , 2009 after he was loaned out by his Brazilian club Bonsucesson Futebol Clube of Brazil .
He made his debut with the club the following day assisting on Sasha Kljestan ’s second goal in a 2 - 0 win over Toronto FC .
He played in eight games in 2009 , seven as a starter and finished that season with a goal , and an assist .
The forward also scored a goal in the first leg of the western conference semi-final of the 2009 MLS Cup Playoffs in a 2 - 2 draw with the L.A. Galaxy .
Prior to joining MLS , Santos has played professionally in Brazil , Libya , and Israel .
He will be available for selection for Saturday ’s game against the Colorado Rapids in a noon ET kick - off at BMO Field .
An attempt was made to poison a key American adviser involved in the bidding for a multibillion dollar mining contract in Afghanistan by replacing beer in a bottle with sulfuric acid .
The little - reported incident occurred in June 2007 but takes on new interest with the publication by the Wikileaks website of an intelligence warning in February 2007 that Pakistan ’s ISI spy agency was planning to poison soldiers ' alcoholic drinks .
James Yeager , an American geologist who advised Afghanistan 's Ministry of Mines , tells the Monitor he returned to his residence in Kabul to find it had been burgled .
The intruder took money from a drawer and left behind a bottle of Corona beer .
IN PICTURES : Top notorious spies
The Corona bottle sat on his counter for the next two weeks Yeager says , because Corona is one of his least favorite beers .
He finally opened it during a going away party as the other drinks began to run low .
“ I pulled it out and when I popped it there was no fizz and the cap was loose , ” says Yeager .
“ Because this one did n’t have fizz you wonder if it went rancid or not , and I just kind of sniffed it and I went ‘ Oh , that does n’t smell like beer . ’ ”
Yeager , a geochemist familiar with acids , realized it smelled like sulfuric acid – otherwise known as battery acid .
He called a friend over who had the same reaction to the smell .
Yeager poured the “ beer ” into the toilet and it foamed and fizzed , leaving “ no question ” in his mind it was sulfuric acid .
Among the 90,000 documents made public by Wikileaks is an intelligence report claiming that Pakistan ’s spy agency , the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , and insurgents were plotting a similar type of tampering .
“ A local Authority reported that ISI and insurgents are going to buy alcoholic drinks from markets [ in order to ] mix them with poison and use them for poisoning ” Afghan and international troops , reads the report in the Wikileaks trove .
Media outlets including the Guardian in Britain highlighted the supposed plan as “ highly implausible ” and used it to caution that much of the Wikileaks ’ intelligence data dump may be “ low grade ” and unreliable .
Experts told of the actual poisoning attempt of the American adviser say that it does n’t change the advice to the public to take the Wikileaks reports with a big grain of salt – but it does highlight the need for professionals to sift through the Wikileaks material to give a realistic judgment on the threats .
“ There ’s a need for a greater examination and categorization of these 90,000 reports .
I ’m sure a lot of these reports are of low reliability , ” says B. Raman , former head of counterintelligence for India ’s spy agency , the Research and Analysis Wing .
Yeager says he does n’t know who was behind the poisoning attempt .
He ’s glad no one got hurt , but ultimately he treats the incident lightly .
“ I work internationally a lot and it ’s just one of those things ...
It ’s entertaining .
You just go on , ” he says with a laugh .
He says at the time he thought , “ Who cares I ’m going home . ”
Yeager served as an adviser to the Ministry of Mines during the international bidding for rights to mine Afghanistan ’s Aynak copper deposit .
The Chinese eventually won the $ 2.9 billion contract .
Before leaving in 2007 , Yeager urged the Karzai administration to reexamine the bids .
Two years later , he released a report criticizing the tender process , saying that the ministry did not operate transparently and that Chinese firms do not have to play by the same anti-bribery rules as American firms .
Alcohol is officially banned in Afghanistan and Pakistan , but it can be distributed in foreigners - only venues and is easily obtained on the black market .
Pakistani security analyst Rifaat Hussein notes that food and drink tampering plots are not unheard of in the region .
He referenced a recent case where the US Embassy in Pakistan warned American citizens against using a catering company due to an alleged association with Faizal Shahzad , the New York Times Square bomber .
“ I think we should not dismiss [ the Wikileaks report ] just because it is emanating from Afghan sources who may have a vested interest in trying to discredit the Pakistani intelligence services , ” says Dr. Hussein .

( Dagbladet ) : I løpet av første halvår 2010 har Norsk pasientskadeerstatning ( NPE ) mottatt 2277 nye erstatningskrav etter påstått behandlingssvikt i helsevesenet .
Dette er en økning på 10,3 prosent mot samme periode i 2009 , skriver NPE på sine nettsider .
Økningen er på nesten 10 prosent for saker knyttet til offentlig helsevesen , 12 prosent for legemiddelsaker og 19 prosent for privat sektor .
- Vi hadde forventet en viss økning av innkomne saker , da dette er en utvikling vi har sett over flere år , sier assisterende direktør Rolf Gunnar Jørstad og legger til :
- At økningen for privat sektor er høyere enn for offentlig helsevesen er ikke overraskende , da privat sektor først ble omfattet av pasientskadeordningen fra 1 . januar 2009 .
- Økt rettighetsbevissthet Han ser flere mulige årsaker til de rekordmange behandlingsklagene .
- Generelt sett er nok ordningen stadig mer kjent både i befolkningen og blant helsepersonell .
Man skal heller ikke se bort fra at økt rettighetsbevissthet i befolkingen spiller inn .
Vi erfarer også at mange saker i media om feil og svikt i helsevesenet gjør at flere melder krav om erstatning , sier Jørstad .
Han avviser at tallene gir grunnlag for å si at kvaliteten på helsetjenestene har blitt dårligere .
- Men det er samtidig grunn til å tro at det er mørketall når det gjelder pasientskader .
Jørstad sier at det er positivt at pasienter som mener seg påført skade melder saker til NPE slik at de får utredet om de har krav på erstatning eller ikke .
440 mill .
I løpet av første halvår av 2010 har det blitt utbetalt 439,4 millioner kroner , noe som er en økning på 10 prosent sammenlignet med samme periode i fjor .
Erstatninger knyttet til offentlige helsetjenester har alene økt med nesten 10 prosent og står for 96 prosent av utbetalingene .
- Økning i utbetalinger skyldes for det meste interne effektiviseringstiltak hos oss .
Vi har både startet opp og sluttført flere utmålingssaker enn i foregående år , påpeker Jørstad .
As a signed - up member of the deflation camp , I think the Bank and the Fed are right to keep their nerve and delay the withdrawal of stimulus -- though that case is easier to make in the US where core inflation has dropped to the lowest since the mid 1960s .
But fact that O Parsson ’s book is suddenly in demand in elite banking circles is itself a sign of the sort of behavioral change that can become self - fulfilling .
PRINCETON , NJ --
The conservative shift in Americans ' views on abortion that Gallup first recorded a year ago has carried over into 2010 .
Slightly more Americans call themselves " pro-life " than " pro-choice , " 47 % vs. 45 % , according to a May 3 - 6 Gallup poll .
This is nearly identical to the 47 % to 46 % division found last July following a more strongly pro-life advantage of 51 % to 42 % last May .
While the two - percentage - point gap in current abortion views is not significant , it represents the third consecutive time Gallup has found more Americans taking the pro-life than pro-choice position on this measure since May 2009 , suggesting a real change in public opinion .
By contrast , in nearly all readings on this question since 1995 , and each survey from 2003 to 2008 , more Americans called themselves pro-choice than pro-life .
Shift Limited to Republicans and Independents
According to two - year averages of these results since 2001 , Republicans have become more likely to call themselves pro-life since polling conducted in 2003 / 2004 , as have Republican - leaning independents since 2005 / 2006 .
Independents who lean to neither party also became more likely to call themselves " pro-life " between 2003/2004 and 2005 /2006 , but have since held steady .
Democrats ' self - identification with the pro-life position has moved in the other direction , declining from 37 % in 2003 /2004 to 31 % in 2009 /2010 .
Among independents who lean Democratic , there has been no movement in either direction .
Age and Gender Trends Mirror Overall Pattern
All age groups have become more attached to the pro-life label since 2005 , with particularly large increases among young adults and those aged 50 to 64 years in the latest period between 2007/ 2008 and 2009/2010 .
Both genders have also become more likely to identify as pro-life , with the increase among women coming mainly since 2008 , whereas the increase in men started after 2006 .
Underlying Moral Reaction to Abortion is Unchanged
It is not entirely clear why Americans have grown more likely to embrace the pro-life label when defining their own views on the issue , especially because there has not been an attendant increase in opposition to abortion on moral grounds .
Half of Americans currently say abortion is morally wrong -- in line with most of Gallup 's readings on this question since 2001 , although higher than the initial 45 % recorded in 2001 and a one - time 44 % reading in 2006 .
Barring evidence that Americans are growing more wary about the morality of abortion per se , the trends by party identification suggest that increased political polarization may be a factor in Republicans ' preference for the " pro-life " label , particularly since Barack Obama took office .
Whatever the cause , the effect is that the pro-life label has become increasingly dominant among Republicans and to a lesser degree among independents , while the pro-choice label has become more dominant among Democrats .

Dicelab
What is Dicelab ?
Dicelab is a tool to calculate the probability distribution of dice rolling schemes , and to roll dice accoring to such schemes .
This can be used to analyse or design games , but may be useful in other situations as well .
Using a formal language to specify the dice rolling schemes allows dicelab to handle many , if not most , real and imaginable dice rolling problems .
Example
Assuming a fictional table - top roleplaying game uses the following scheme to determine success or failure : the player rolls N dice ( determined by her skill ) , and discards all the lowest N - 2 dice .
The remaining two dice are summed up and compared against a problem - specific threshold T. If e.g. a player with a skill of three would try to beat a threshold of 10 , what would be his odds ?
dicelab allows calculating just that :
count > 10 sum keep high 2 3#d6 ;
which would result in the following output :
0 0.800926 1 0.199074
Features
Can precisely calculate the distribution , roll the dice and estimate the distribution by rolling many times and summing up .
Interface allows usage in scripts .
Full - featured formal language that allows to specify most dice rolling schemes .
Internal optimiser that reduces the complexity of many rolls .
Documentation
Dicelab comes with a manual that tries to explain the usage and the formal language .
This manual can also be viewed online : dicelab_manual.pdf .
If you want to check whether the current version contains any changed relevant to you , please refer to the ChangeLog .
Download
The basic dicelab distribution contains the sources and has to be compiled manually to be usable .
For Windows users , who often have problems compiling programs themselves , a separate file containing pre-compiled windows binaries is provided .
Please note that dicelab may be provided through your distributions packaging system on some operating systems ( e.g. Debian and Ubuntu ) .

Mary Anne Hobbs announced on Friday that she 's quitting her popular Radio 1 show Experimental ( formerly The Breezeblock ) after 14 years to be a lecturer at the University of Sheffield .
It 's a typically dramatic and decisive gesture from someone who has carved out her own niche throughout a mindboggling career .
I grew up reading Hobbs in NME in the mid to late 80s .
It was pretty much the magazine 's last great era , and she held her own in the boys ' club of Stuart Maconie , David Quantick , Danny Kelly , Andrew Collins and Steve Lamacq , writing cover features on Nirvana and Happy Mondays .
I enjoyed her DJing and confrontational interviews on Xfm and Radio 1 , where as well as playing brutally extreme guitar music , she was the only person bar her mentor John Peel to feature records from the odder corners of electronica .
I only began to realise just how much she had achieved when our paths crossed in 2005 thanks to the emerging sound of dubstep .
I championed its bass throb in my small way in the press , but Hobbs gave the localised scene an almighty boot up the arse , sending it global to a degree no comparable UK underground genre has ever managed .
Watching Hobbs shepherd a fledgling scene to the point where its core artists are producing Britney Spears , Snoop Dogg and Rihanna was impressive enough .
But as I got to know ( and interview ) her , I realised she escaped an abusive home at 16 to live in a car park with a hard rock band because " that 's how you became a music writer " .
She has the strength of character to stare down John Lydon and charm Chuck D , and counts Jeremy Paxman and Chris Morris as friends .
Hobbs is not giving up music evangelism – she still DJs around the world with the energy of someone half her age – and Radio 1 has not announced what will happen to her programme , so the ramifications of her move are not clear yet .
But there 's no question that , like everything else she 's done , her departure will stir things up for a lot of people on a surprisingly large scale .
A federal appeals court reversed itself Friday and dismissed a lawsuit by a Southern California man who was Tasered by a police officer after being stopped for not wearing a seat belt .
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had initially ruled in Carl Bryan 's case in December , saying police must have reasons to believe a suspect is dangerous before firing a Taser and can't use the weapon merely because the person is disobeying orders or acting erratically .
The court reaffirmed that conclusion Friday , setting legal standards for excessive - force suits against police who use stun guns in the Ninth Circuit 's jurisdiction of California and eight other Western states .
But the three - judge panel also said - contrary to its previous decision - that the laws governing Tasers were unclear at the time of the incident and the officer would not necessarily have known that he was violating Bryan 's rights .
A previous Ninth Circuit ruling referred to the Taser as a " pain - compliance " weapon and did not specify that it could be used only against someone who posed a threat , the court said .
The officer " could have made a reasonable mistake of law regarding the constitutionality of the Taser use , " Judge Kim Wardlaw said in the 3 - 0 ruling Friday .
U.S. Supreme Court decisions allow suits against police only for violating " clearly established " rights .
Bryan was 21 when a police officer in his hometown of Coronado ( San Diego County ) stopped him as he was driving home in July 2005 .
Wearing only boxer shorts and tennis shoes , and upset for forgetting to fasten his seat belt , Bryan swore at himself as he stepped out of the car , and was shouting gibberish and banging his thighs as he stood 15 to 25 feet away from Officer Brian MacPherson , the court said .
MacPherson said Bryan then took one step toward him .
Bryan denied it , and the court said the evidence indicated that Bryan had been facing away when the officer fired his Taser .
Bryan fell on his face , breaking four front teeth .
He was charged with a misdemeanor of resisting and opposing an officer , but prosecutors dropped the case after the jury deadlocked .
Bryan then sued MacPherson and the city .
The court said Bryan 's claims , if true , would show that the officer had used excessive force .
Bryan was unarmed and was not threatening MacPherson , the court said , and the officer did not warn him he might be Tasered .
Stun guns inflict severe pain and should be used be used only when substantial force is necessary and other options are unavailable , the court said .
" The objective facts must indicate that the suspect poses an immediate threat to the officer or a member of the public , " Wardlaw wrote .
MacPherson 's lawyer , Steven Boehmer , said the panel had set " a clear standard for Taser use , " while not retroactively applying the rules to the officer 's actions .
Bryan may appeal further , said his lawyer , Eugene Iredale .
Any officer with common sense , he said , should know that blasting a non-resisting seat - belt violator with 50,000 volts of electricity is " clearly illegal and an excessive use of force . "
When the author Justin Spring finally tracked down the executor of Samuel Steward ’s estate , he had no idea what this sexual outlaw and little - known literary figure had left behind after his death in 1993 .
So he was taken unawares by the 80 boxes full of drawings , letters , photographs , sexual paraphernalia , manuscripts and other items , including an autograph and reliquary with pubic hair from Rudolph Valentino , a thousand - page confessional journal Steward created at the request of the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey , and a green metal card catalog labeled “ Stud File , ” which contained a meticulously documented record on index cards of every sexual experience and partner 
Rock Hudson , Thornton Wilder , “ One-eyed Sadist ”  that Steward said he had had over 50 years .
An attic full of items contained a secret history of a little - documented strand of gay life in the middle decades of the 20th century .
Steward ’s experience stands in stark contrast to the familiar story of furtive concealment and persecution in the period before gay liberation .
As new biographies of artists and writers like E.M. Forster detail the effects of sexual repression on their work , Steward ’s history shows what a life of openness , when embraced , entailed day to day .

I 'm not going to lie : I was getting bored .
Somewhere along the way , I 'd lost my passion for geriatric podiatry , the one thing I thought would always matter to me .
As a young doctor , my heart would race as I thought of the joys that awaited me within Mr. Berkowitz 's tasseled loafers , or the wonders to be revealed as Mrs. Deacon slipped off her orthopedic shoes .
But after 30 years and 14,000 feet , I was going through the motions .
Sure , I could drain an infected ingrown toenail as skillfully as ever , but it was work and nothing more .
Advertisement
That was then .
As of my 10:30 appointment yesterday , I am reborn .
I was n't expecting much from Mr. Marinucci .
He told me he had some slight swelling in his feet , and while peripheral edema was nothing new to me , it had lost all its charm .
As I helped him onto the examination table , I was already looking ahead to the moment I prescribed him some diuretics and sent him on his way .
But as soon as he took off his socks , I knew I was in the presence of something rare and wonderful .
Advertisement
Just like that , I was fresh out of podiatry school again , thrilling to the feel of elderly chapped skin , savoring the faint crackle it made as I pressed against it with my thumbs .
Every tiny fissure was a testament to this man 's 89 years of footsteps .
And there , in front of the ankle — those veins !
Perhaps the most magnificent varicose bundle I had ever witnessed in three decades of medical practice .
Only a person this old , this well - lived , could offer such gnarled splendor .
The stories those veins could tell if given the chance …
Mr. Marinucci 's swelling was , well , magnificent .
I 've seen plenty of fluid buildup over the years , but this was perfect , resisting my probing finger neither too much nor too little .
But there was more , like the corns on the outside of his big toes .
People of all ages get them , of course , but there 's a profound difference between the ones some 23 - year - old gets from playing basketball in sneakers that are too tight and the ones a man like Mr. Marinucci earns over a long lifetime of overpronation .
His corns , like his flattened arches and the worn padding on his heels , whispered the wisdom of a million footsteps .
Advertisement
And I was learning to listen all over again .
I suddenly realized how blessed I was to be looking at feet like this and how foolish my colleagues were for bragging about the young and shapely extremities they saw in their offices .
Let them keep their pretty , pedicured specimens ; I will choose the feet of our most aged men and women , and I will cherish the lessons their feet have to impart .
Any podiatrist who cannot appreciate Mr. Marinucci 's flawlessly symmetrical bunions is n't worthy of the profession .
Advertisement
Of course , I could work another 30 years and probably never see feet like Mr. Marinucci 's again .
That perfect mix of advanced age , biological predisposition , and neglect only comes around once in a career .
But that hardly matters , because the world is full of wonder : Mrs. Hutchinson may not have a metatarsal deformity , but I can delight in skin as delicate as rice paper ; Mr. Drake might not have a plantar wart , but there — in the nook between his third and fourth toe — fungus !
Every senior citizen has feet with something to offer .
I 'm ashamed I ever forgot that .
Anyway , my two o'clock just arrived .
I 'm not sure what brought her here today .
All I know is that she 's old and so are her feet .
And from now on , that 's good enough for me .

Bena Burda , founder of Maggie 's Organics in Ypsilanti's , helped her company achieve certification recognizing the company met fair labor standards .

“ First and foremost , it ’s priced for the average customer to purchase , ” said Maggie ’s founder and CEO BenÃ¡ Burda .
“ We try to make organic affordable .
It ’s well - designed , and customers love it .
“ We try to do the right thing that ’s alternative to traditional sweatshop models . ”
The spring line includes camisoles , tanks , T - shirts , wrap tops , hoodies , wide leg pants , leggings knit dresses and scarves .
Prices range from $ 12 to $ 35 .
“ Customers are very excited that there ’s something like this , ” said Maggie ’s vice president Doug Wilson .
“ We can sleep at night knowing that everyone in the process has not only been treated fairly , but is making contributions to their community . ”
The detailed certification processÂ is monitored by Scientific Certification Systems , one of three organizations that verify fair labor practices .
It required Maggie ’s to identify each level of the apparel ’s production from the organic cotton grower and cotton gin and spinning mill cooperatives in Nicaragua to the knitting and sewing factory in Costa Rica to the screen printing and office and warehouse operations in Michigan .
Burda accompanied the inspectors to each location , but had to sit out when it came time to interview management and workers .
“ That process for me was a really big learning experience , ” Burda said .
Certifications for fair labor or fair trade usually extend to commodities like bananas , coffee and tea , but Maggie ’s becomes the first apparel company in the world to receive certification of this kind .
Burda hopes fair labor catches on with other apparel makers .
“ We think this is ground breaking work , and the momentum behind the issues is driven by customers , ” Burda said .
“ Our customers care what goes in their body , and now what goes around their body .
I think out of the concern for how food is grown is a greater concern for how a product is produced , so it ’s a natural segue to ask how workers are treated .
“ With the anti-sweatshop movement , this seems to be a natural fit . ”

The Reprehensible Sexualization of Rape
By Dustin Rowles | Industry | July 13 , 2010 |
Three years ago , after I had a kid , a lot of the commenters razzed me and suggested that I ’d mellow out .
In my mind , I told them to go fuck themselves , but they were right .
There ’s still quite a bit that will get my ire up , but my default setting is no longer quiet , bubbling rage ( that ’s TK ’s territory these days ) .
You have a kid and the unicorns and rainbows come out , and it ’s harder to hold a muzzleloader to the world .
I no longer want to kill everyone , but I still want to murder the people behind the I Spit on Your Grave remake in the face .
And the neck .
And in the junk .
I know I ’m a broken record on this , but the movie poster for the film came out , and even though I told myself I would n’t speak of the remake again — because in doing so , it inadvertently promotes it — I ca n’t help myself .
Because my lips curled , and my hands started to tremble like a goddamn nursing home geriatric trying to button his sweater vest .
I even slept on it , thinking the feeling might subside , but when I woke up this morning and caught another glance at the movie poster , I wanted to cause malicious , violent harm to director Steven R. Monroe and everyone at Anchor Bay Entertainment responsible for this bullshit .
Because as bad as the original film was — and no movie has ever made me as homicidal as that 1978 film — at least the movie poster highlighted the fact that it was supposed to be a feminist revenge flick , even if it was the absolute farthest thing from that .
This new poster , which pays homage to the original movie poster , does n’t even get that right :
It pays lip service with the very small “ Day of the Woman ” caption tucked away in the lower right hand corner .
But otherwise , the only thing you can say for this poster is that it sexualizes a rape victim .
And not just any rape victim , but a woman who is brutally gang raped by several men and left for dead .
And they show the bruises and the dirt and the dried blood , but they make goddamn sure that they also airbush that ass .
Because the assholes who put together this poster want to titillate you ; they want you to see the movie , not because this woman takes revenge on her rapists , but because this hot lady with a nice ass gets gang - raped on a rock .
That is the only explanation for this movie poster .
It ’s inexplicable .
It ’s fucked up .
And they make motherfucking sure to highlight the fact that it ’s unrated , as if to say to the redneck assholes who get off on this bullshit :
She ’s gonna get raped real good .
Those fucking troglodytic peons : Jump up my ass .
Die in a house fire .
And not from the blazes , you shitheels , but slowly from smoke inhalation .
And I hope , while you ’re coughing up your goddamn lungs , someone is standing behind you and shoving a bar stool up your ass .
This bullshit is inexcusable .
Here ’s the movie poster , and for anyone that sports wood at the sight of this woman ’s ass : 1 ) Get a life , 2 ) Do n’t be so fucking pathetic , and 3 ) I hope you stub your dick in the door .

One year ago today : i've mentioned this oxygen molecule death before , but i feel the people must be informed .
only just now i looked it up and SCIENCE says that it takes a few minutes to suffocate in a vacuum , so you would n't die instantly if you were this cosmically unlucky chap to have all the oxygen randomly bounce away from him !
awesome , man , that 's one life fear assuaged

This is a guest post by Jerry Paffendorf .
What should you do if you dream of starting the next big thing on the internet that has real world impact ?
You should leave San Francisco and come to Detroit !
Duh !
Wait .
What ?
Yep .
I think so .
I moved to Detroit a little over a year ago after founding a startup with friends in Brooklyn , raising money from investors in Silicon Valley , being forced to move to San Francisco and then getting fired along with everyone else because we were a bit outside the box on our approach .
That was a lot of heartbreaking fun !
( For the record , we built a real - time social layer for your browser that let ’s you follow friends around the web live , see their cursors move around pages , chat and leave comments and graffiti anywhere on any site – it was crazy and awesome and now it ’s in a shoebox but will live again . )
I used my last California unemployment checks to get a studio at the Russell Industrial Center and set out conceiving of LOVELAND micro real estate , an evolving online - offline project that ’s seen modest bootstrapped success and has a bright future as we organically respond to what works and what does n’t , experimenting with a combination of micro-payments , maps , virtual goods , social ownership , narrative and other elements of online games tied to real land and things .
Hear me out a second .
There ’s the commonplace story of artists moving to Detroit to make use of all the big , cheap space .
Less commonplace is the story of digital creatives moving here for the same , but also to tackle a different set of problems with a very different set of real world influences that you have in places with traditional internet culture , where they pile programmers and design hipsters high like sticks in a bonfire and burn them up towards the status quo .
In my view that ’s a bit of a waste .
Detroit has real problems and in addition to all the necessary ground work it needs new online and mobile solutions for connecting and empowering people and communities , increasing transparency , fundraising , mapping , planning , globally showcasing the great local work of the less internet - savvy , making it fun to participate in reinvention , and so on down the line .
The slightly adventurous developers and designers amongst you will find a thousand things to do , as well as a lot of attention and support for your efforts , and just a thousand of you will make a big difference .
I can imagine massive new internet success grown from Detroit ’s unique condition , infrastructure and creative influences , that the rest of the world would never think of , but will happily adopt to make their lives better , too .
Am I crazy or can you ?
Could be both .
But there 's only one way to find out . :-)

In a 1997 light - hearted comedy , " Excess Baggage , " Benicio del Toro ( an inadvertent kidnapper ) asks Alicia Silverstone ( the unintended kidnap victim ) , " How stupid do you think I am ? "
Silverstone classically deadpans her response , " How stupid is there ? "
I thought of this scene often this past week as I watched WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange attempt to explain and then justify his dumping of some 75,000 classified U.S. intelligence documents into the public domain .
It was hard to suppress a laugh as he attempted to justify the release of documents based on their content when most of us in the actual business of secrets know that reports are more often classified because of their source , not their content .
Suppress a laugh .
Except that this is n't a comedy .
It 's a tragedy .
And innocents will die .
First of all , let 's look at the " up " side of this release .
These documents " prove " that war is grittier when viewed by an infantryman than by a policymaker ; that Pakistan 's intelligence service , the ISI , is a difficult partner ; that in war innocent civilians sometimes die ; and that the Taliban has been growing in strength over the past several years .
Not quite " stop the presses " kind of revelations .
Now the downsides .
According to multiple press accounts , despite WikiLeaks ' claim that it had redacted source - identifying information from the military 's intelligence reports , it apparently did a half - baked job and real names of real people are being exposed .
Beyond that , even when you effectively mask source - identifying data , the enemy knows who did or who did not know about the historic operation or meeting or rendezvous now being made public in a leaked American document .
I can already see the Taliban or al Qaeda dialogue : " Brother , in whose house did we hold that meeting in 2007 ? "
WikiLeaks , as part of its self - justification , contends that much of this information is dated , none of it more recent that seven months ago .
Let me remind readers that we send young Americans in harm 's way ( and frequently are forced to kill our adversaries ) in order to retrieve this kind of information on al Qaeda and the Taliban .
This data dump is the moral and cyber equivalent of capturing an al Qaeda hard drive , a treasure trove of historical knowledge that enlightens and informs current operations .
With this release , the enemy now knows about us that which we struggle so hard to learn about him :
What we do well and what we do less well , where our thinking is strong and where it is not , where our analysis is incisive and where we have blind spots .
I used to give the graduation address to CIA case officers as they completed their operational training .
At every ceremony I would remind them that they would be taking the fate of their future sources into their hands , that in a powerful moral sense , they would be responsible for the well - being of their sources and , very often , their source 's families .
Without that implied " contract , " why would anyone provide information to us ?
What potential sources in Afghanistan will now believe that America can protect them ?
Why would anyone in that troubled land bet his family 's well - being and future on such a well - intentioned but obviously porous partner , whatever hope or vision for the future this potential source might harbor .
And we will never know who will now not come forward , who will not provide us with life - saving information , who will decide he cannot opt for a common effort against a common enemy .
But we can be certain that the cost will be great .
And foreign intelligence services , with whom we have established productive and legitimate partnerships , will ask , " Can I trust the Americans to keep anything secret ? "
On top of last summer 's voluntary disclosure by the administration of CIA covert actions in America 's previous interrogation program ( over the objection of the current CIA director and seven of his predecessors ) , what liaison service in the world will now accept any assurances that we can protect their secrets ?
Or protect their identity ?
Or be consistent in our policy ?
Finally , I can only imagine what adversary intelligence services worldwide are doing with these documents .
If I were the chief of Russia 's FSB or China 's PLA - 2 , I would be gathering all of my English - speaking officers and directing them to read all 75,000 documents to learn where the Americans are strong , weak , vulnerable , formidable , to be avoided and to be challenged .
And all of this because of some corrupted view of the inherent evils of the modern state , a pseudo - romantic attachment to the absolute value of transparency , a casual indifference to inevitable consequences and a neurotic attachment to one individual 's self importance .
Rarely have we seen such a dangerous combination of arrogance and incompetence .
Perhaps we should ask heaven to help us , because our intelligence services will surely be less able to do so .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael V. Hayden .

Just around the corner from the Eaton Centre , a psychiatric facility is locking up youngsters who do n't belong in secure custody , provincial documents reveal .
In one case , a 15 - year - old girl 's “ moderately eccentric interests ” in origami and the study of bugs were cited by a psychiatrist at Youthdale Treatment Centre as examples of a possible mental disorder .
Another teen 's admission of having unprotected sex was taken as evidence of a suicide wish because such behaviour could lead to AIDS .
“ Secure treatment is not a placement substitute for child welfare , ” a provincial appeal board ruled in ordering the release of a 14 - year - old boy with a learning disability and limited school supports .
A Toronto Star review of 32 cases over the past two years where a youth formally appealed the lock - up decision found that nearly half ( 14 ) were overturned after an emergency hearing by the Ontario Child and Family Services Review Board .
Most of these children were ordered released on the grounds they did n't even have a mental disorder .
Youthdale is a non-profit community agency .
Last year , it received $ 11 million in funding from the Ministry of Children and Youth Services .
In addition to the secure treatment unit and a less restrictive inpatient program downtown that has no maximum length of stay , Youthdale operates four group homes in the Annex , one home in Aurora and three cabins at a remote wilderness setting near Parry Sound for children with mental health issues .
The centre also runs a 24 - hour telephone crisis line , which is often the first step toward getting a child admitted .
With consent from a legal guardian — often children 's aid — youth 16 years and younger can be held in Youthdale 's secure unit for up to 30 days where they may receive mood - altering medications .
Disruptive behaviour may be managed with chemical injections as well as mechanical and physical restraints .
Paul Allen , Youthdale 's clinical director , said a review of his agency 's policies and practices , led by two psychiatrists in response to complaints from former patients and parents , is underway .
A report is expected later this summer .
“ The challenge of balancing a child 's rights and needs for treatment is a complicated matter , ” Allen said .
To lock up a child , provincial law states that a facility must satisfy five criteria .
It must demonstrate the child has a mental disorder ; poses a substantial threat to himself or others ; that secure custody would prevent the child from causing serious bodily harm to himself or others ; that the facility offers appropriate treatment for the child 's mental disorder and that there are no less restrictive method available .
A “ mental disorder ” is defined by the Child and Family Services Act as “ a substantial disorder of emotional process , thought or cognition , which grossly impairs a person 's capacity to make reasoned judgments . ”
Once committed , the child meets with a provincial youth advocate who informs him he is allowed to appeal his secure placement .
In 2009 , 117 youth were admitted to the secure floor for 30 days .
Appeals were filed by 30 youth , but 19 withdrew their applications before the hearing .
Of the remaining 11 , seven were ordered released .
The girl with the “ moderately eccentric interest ” in the study of bugs appealed in December 2008 .
The board ruled the 15 - year - old , gifted student 's behaviour — pouring flour on the floor and getting into physical confrontations with her mother — was the result of teen - parent conflict and was not caused by a mental disorder .
In the case of the girl who admitted to having unprotected sex , Youthdale claimed the teen refused to take birth control pills , which indicated a “ gross impairment to make reasoned decisions . ”
The board 's decision cited evidence that the child had discussed birth control with a doctor and that the teen 's mother threw out sample pills and refused to fill the prescription .
The board also took issue with a psychiatrist 's suggestion that the teen 's ability to make reasoned judgments was impaired because she took Prozac only when she needed to feel better .
“ This is typical of even adult patients taking medication , ” the board wrote in its decision .
“ To suggest that a child should be admitted to a treatment centre because of this is unrealistic . ”
Review board chair Suzanne Gilbert , a lawyer who specializes in criminal law and youth protection , told the Star she would not comment on individual cases .
The board , which must rule within five days of receiving an application , has members with backgrounds in education , law , social services and mental health .
“ To lock a child in a secure area is a very serious decision , ” she said .
Gilbert noted that of the three Ontario facilities with secure treatment units , all but one of the recent appeals have come from Youthdale .
Youthdale 's headquarters is a four - storey , tan brick building on Victoria St. A sleep research clinic and gymnasium occupy the basement .
There are as many as 20 children occupying beds in rooms on the upper two floors at any given time .
Ten beds are reserved for children who present emotional and behavioral issues but no imminent risk of harm to themselves or others .
The locked fourth floor is set aside for up to 10 children considered at immediate risk of seriously hurting themselves or others .
“ Our approach to managing kids when they are distressed and agitated is well in advance of the 1950s , ” said Allen , responding to comments from critics who suggested Youthdale 's methods were outdated .
Allen said the agency 's treatment plans are “ good as any care you will find in any hospital or any other mental health centre . ”
Allen invited the Star to tour the facility last month .
Two of the children in the secure unit were in common areas at the time .
One cherub - cheeked boy is seated alone inside a room with glass windows playing a hand - held electronic game .
A girl sat by herself at a table , staring blankly ahead while holding a picture of trees torn from a magazine .
Their bedrooms , though impeccably clean , are cell - like — big enough only to accommodate the length of a twin - size bed , which is fitted with a flat sheet and a pancake - thin pillow .
A window is covered in external blinds that open and close with a magnetic device held by staff .
On this day , in the early afternoon , they are shut .
The only personal artifact that shows a child sleeps here is a small , plush toy dinosaur perched on a shelf high out of arm 's reach .

Dr. Nathan Scharf , Youthdale 's director of psychological services , explained that the facility has been admitting more children under the age of 12 .
Many , he said , have neuro - developmental disorders .
Scharf estimated that one - third of youngsters admitted to the secure unit now fall into this demographic .
“ They 're damaged in the sense that there is something wrong with them from the time they were born , ” he added .
In one of the cases the Star reviewed , Youthdale argued a 14 - year - old girl was a danger to herself because she once said , “ I wish I was dead ” after learning she could never return home to live with her mother .
The girl was in the care of the Catholic Children 's Aid Society and suffered from seizure - like episodes during which she drooled and walked into walls .
These episodes were considered further proof she posed a danger to herself .
She was considered a danger to others on grounds that she can become “ loud and argumentative . ”
The review board ruled there was “ no evidence that an emergency measure was at all warranted .
“ It appears ( the Catholic Children 's Aid Society ) was looking for a way to have her problems diagnosed and receive appropriate treatment after hitting an impasse in the child 's care , ” the board 's decision states .
Youthdale 's Scharf suggested the review board 's decisions are subjective .
“ How they interpret the information is subject to their own attitudes and philosophies , ” he said .
In another case , the review board ordered released a 14 - year - old boy who had a learning disability and was suspended for skipping school .
The board noted “ a clear link between the child 's lack of appropriate school supports and behavioural difficulties . ”
The board recommended less - intrusive options to help the child , such as working with the local hospital to access assessment and counseling services .
In one case involving a 14 - year - old girl whose mother contacted children 's aid for help after her daughter was sexually assaulted , Scharf told the review board an assessment at the centre 's secure treatment unit will sometimes lead to prioritizing youth with community resources .
The board called this an “ irrelevant consideration . ”
“ To deprive a child of her liberty in order to more readily access community resources , ” the decision stated , “ flies in the face of the use of secure treatment as an extraordinary measure of last resort . ”
The Ministry of Children and Youth Services told the Star it is committed to providing support for “ our must vulnerable , ” which is why it empowered the review board to scrutinize admissions into secure treatment .
Said ministry spokesperson Paris Meilleur : “ The statistics demonstrate the process works and that the review board is serving its purpose . ”
Today I found out everything you probably think you know about Velociraptors is a lie .
Now to be fair , everything I “ knew ” about Velociraptors came from the Jurassic Park movies and so I should n’t really be surprised it was all wrong .
So if , like me , you thought that Velociraptors were slightly bigger than a human ; reptilian looking ; hunted in packs ; were found in what is now the United States ; and were ridiculously intelligent .
Well , literally none of that is true .
Velociraptors were actually only about the size of a domesticated Turkey , being only about 3 feet tall and 6 feet long , with most of the length coming from the tail and weighing in at around 20 - 30 pounds full grown .
More than that , they also looked somewhat like a Turkey as well , but with a long tail obviously .
It turns out , Velociraptors were very similar to birds in a lot of ways .
They had hollow bones , feathers , built nests for their eggs , and are thought to have behaved very similar to birds .
As Mark Norell , curator of fossil reptiles , amphibians , and birds at the American Museum of Natural History , stated , “ The more that we learn about these animals the more we find that there is basically no difference between birds and their closely related dinosaur ancestors like Velociraptor .
Both have wishbones ; brooded their nests ; possess hollow bones ; and were covered in feathers .
If animals like Velociraptor were alive today , our first impression would be that they were just very unusual looking birds . ”
More than that , there has never been one bit of evidence that suggested that Velociraptors hunted in packs .
In fact , every fossil found of Velociraptors has seemed to indicate they were solitary creatures .
There was even one fossil where the Velociraptor was in the act of trying to kill a Protoceratops , which was a pig sized dinosaur , when a sandstorm came up and buried them both while they were still fighting one another .
If they hunted in packs , there should have been more Velociraptors at that find , particularly given the size of the Protoceratops relative to the Velociraptor .
Next up , the Velociraptors were not found in the United States , as the films suggested : where the paleontologists in the film dug up the Velociraptor skeleton in Montana .
In fact , they have only been found in Central Asia around Mongolia .
Were they intelligent ?
Well , for a dinosaur , it is thought they were somewhat intelligent due to their brain size relative to body size .
But it turns out , that ’s basically just saying they were slightly more intelligent than a board with a nail in it .
For reference , the dinosaur that is thought to have been the smartest of all dinosaurs was the Troodon ; it is thought to have been around as smart as a primitive opossum .
So there goes the whole Philosraptor thing out the window .
The deepest thoughts a Velociraptor ever thought were probably on the level of the Seagulls in Finding Nemo .
“ Mine ? ” Hardly the “ smarter than dolphins , whales , and some primates ” that Dr. Alan Grant in Jurassic Park III suggests .
Actually , if you ’ve ever raised domestic Turkey ’s , which I have and do n’t recommend , the “ just slightly more intelligent than a board with a nail in it ” , is about the domestic Turkey ’s level of intelligence too .
I ’m beginning to think Velociraptors were nothing but domestic Turkeys with slightly different bone structure . 😉
So what were they thinking in Jurassic Park ?
Well basically , they modeled what they called the “ Velociraptor ” in the movie after the Deinonychus .
The Deinonychus were also raptors , but were significantly bigger than the Velociraptors , coming in at about 12 feet long , about 6 feet tall , and weighing about 150 pounds full grown .
Pretty much picture the “ Velociraptor ” in Jurassic Park and you get a pretty good idea of what the Deinonychus were thought to have looked like ( although there still is some debate over whether they too had feathers , with many researchers leaning that way ; so really , picture the “ Velociraptor ” in Jurassic Park and add feathers and you get the Deinonychus ) .
The Deinonychus also were thought to have occasionally hunted in packs to bring down larger prey and were thought to have been very fast .
Their habitat was in the forests of North America .
Now on the intelligence bit , they too were n’t really thought to have been very intelligent .
Although , clearly they were at least smart enough to work together to bring down larger prey when the need arose .

Bonus Facts :
Despite the feathers and the fact that certain of the Velociraptors ’ closely related ancestors could fly , the Velociraptors are thought to have not had the ability to fly due to their weight proportional to their short forelimbs .
A full grown Velociraptor weighed in at about 20 - 30 pounds .
Once again , very similar to a Turkey .
Though of course , wild Turkeys are typically a bit lighter than that and can fly in short bursts and are great gliders over short distances .
But domesticated turkeys weigh in closer to the Velociraptors projected weight and cannot fly .
Much like Chickens and Turkeys , Velociraptors also had similar looking claws , but in the Velociraptors ’ case with the middle claw being retractable .
It could extend out to about 3 inches for stabbing and slashing and was the Velociraptors ’ primary weapon .
This is similar to the spurs on a rooster or male turkey .
Velociraptors were also probably warm - blooded .
They are thought to have had about the same metabolism as the Kiwi , which is similar in anatomy , feather type , bone structure , and nasal passages ; the latter of which is usually a good indicator of metabolism in animals .
Also , cold blooded animals typically wo n’t pursue prey ; they prefer to lie in wait until the prey comes to them .
Velociraptors clearly were built for pursuing prey .
The name “ Velociraptor ” comes from the Latin “ velox ” , meaning “ swift ” , and “ raptor ” , meaning “ robber ” or “ plunderer ” .
The name was chosen by paleontologist Henry F. Osborn in 1924 , after he discovered the fossil in Mongolia that same year .
It has long been suspected that Velociraptors had feathers , but the evidence proving this has only come very recently .
That evidence came from a discovery in September of 2007 of a forelimb fossil of a Velociraptor that had quill knobs , similar to those found on birds .
Only about a dozen Velociraptor fossils have been found to date .
If you ever want to raise domestic turkeys , one pro-tip is that you need to make their food and water dishes shiny .
If you do n’t , they are n’t typically smart enough to eat and drink , particularly when they are young .
They are pretty obsessed with shiny objects though .
So much so that if the sun glints of a neighboring turkey ’s eyes , the other turkey will very likely try to peck their neighbors eye out to get the shiny object .
This can be used to your advantage though as they mature .
If you go in their cage when the males are mature , they will likely try to attack you .
If there was only one , this is n’t a big deal , though they do have very long and sharp spurs they can rip into you with and can weigh upwards of 45 pounds .
However , when there is a bunch of them coming at you like they are going to attack , this can be a slightly more dangerous proposition .
Their spurs are quite capable of ripping open your insides .
But never fear , just bring a very shiny object in with you .
They will instantly get distracted and forget all about attacking you .
This works pretty much every time .
My object of choice was a knock - off samurai sword .
That way , if the shiny sword did n’t distract them and make them forget about attacking me , I was well protected . 🙂
Another pro-tip : do n’t raise turkeys or really any type of poultry .
Seriously , just do n’t .

Yesterday a Dublin court heard arguments in the case of Christopher Clancy , who dressed up as the Joker and set fire to his school for its " hypocrisy " and for treating students " as sub - human . "
He did € 1 m worth of damage .

According to the Irish Independent :
Garda Liam Ganny told the court that Clancy , who had left the school the previous November , filled six large jerry cans with petrol and cut his way through a wire - mesh fence to access the school grounds .
He smashed in a glass door and proceeded to spill the contents of one can along the corridor .
He then lit the petrol and escaped from the school .
When gardai arrived at the scene they noticed a man dressed " in a purple suit , with green hair , a white face and red painted lips " .
" He was dressed up as The Joker from ' Batman ' , " said Gda Ganny .
" He then told us to go around the corner and we would see what he had done . "
Clancy had video - recorded the burning building on his mobile phone and had planned to send the video clip to his friends .
He told gardai he had left the school five months previous to the arson attack and " that 's when I planned the attack " .
He purchased the jerry cans over a five - week period and hid them in the bushes near the school .
He bought 100 litres of petrol from a nearby petrol station .
He told gardai : " I am glad I did it because the people will realise they can't treat students as sub-human . "

The judge in the case called this a " one - off incident , " and seemed inclined to be lenient - she ordered Clancy to get medical help and postponed sentencing until October .
Clancy is currently planning to attend the Dun Laoghaire College of Art and Design in September .
I , for one , am looking forward to seeing this lad 's artwork .

In the late 1960s the renowned University of Oxford physicist and mathematician Roger Penrose came up with a radically new way to develop a unified theory of physics .
Instead of seeking to explain how particles move and interact within space and time , he proposed that space and time themselves are secondary constructs that emerge out of a deeper level of reality .
But his so - called twistor theory never caught on , and conceptual problems stymied its few proponents .
Like so many other attempts to unify physics , twistors were left for dead .
In October 2003 Penrose dropped by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , N.J. , to visit Edward Witten , the doyen of today ’s leading approach to unification , string theory .
Expecting Witten to chastise him for having criticized string theory as a fad , Penrose was surprised to find that Witten wanted to talk about his forgotten brainchild .
A few months later Witten posted a dense 97 - page paper that tied together twistors and strings — bringing twistors back to life and impressing even the harshest critics of string theory .
In the past few years theorists have built on Witten ’s work and rethought what space and time are .
They have already spun off calculational techniques that make child ’s play of the toughest problems in ordinary particle physics .
“ I have never been more excited about physics in my life , ” says string theorist Nima Arkani - Hamed , who recently moved to the institute from Harvard University to immerse himself in the emerging field .
“ It is developing at a blistering pace right now , with a group of roughly 15 people in the world working on it day and night . ”
Prior to Witten ’s work , twistorians and string theorists moved in separate circles and spoke what might as well have been different languages .
Whereas Penrose and his colleagues have made their names studying Einstein ’s general theory of relativity , string theorists trace their descent to particle physics .
Lionel Mason of Oxford says that when he and Penrose visited Syracuse University in 1987 , they blew off a talk on string theory that , in hindsight , would have given them the clues they needed .
“ We did n’t go to a particle physics seminar — we were relativists , ” he says .
Penrose ’s original goal was to reconsider how quantum principles apply to space and time .
Conventional wisdom held that spacetime geometry should fluctuate on quantum scales , altering how events relate to one another .
But in that case , an event that was supposed to cause another may no longer do so , creating paradoxes such as those found in time - travel stories .
In twistor theory , causal sequences are primary and do not fluctuate .
( The theory gets its name from what causal relations look like around a spinning particle , as shown at the left . )
Instead the location and timing of events fluctuate .
But twistorians could not make this idea precise — until string theorists showed that an event of ambiguous location and time is nothing more or less than a string .
String theorists , for their part , had a promising idea for the creation of space that they could not get to work .
In 1997 they conjectured that particles zipping around in four dimensions can behave just like strings interacting in five dimensions .
The new dimension materializes like a figure in a pop-up book .
Yet this conjuring trick produced only a single dimension of highly warped space .
Using twistor concepts , theorists have now shown how all the dimensions of ordinary space — and even time — can pop out .
Many theorists find it quite natural that spacetime would be derivative .
Andrew Hodges of Oxford points out that we do not perceive spacetime directly ; we infer that events happen in specific locations at specific times from the information that comes to us .
“ This idea of points of spacetime as being primary objects is artificial , ” he says .
Indeed , the concept of distinct positions and times breaks down because of the gravitational warping of spacetime and the notoriously spooky connections between quantum particles .
Whether or not they succeed in remaking space and time , twistorians and string theorists have already endeared themselves to particle physicists .
Even fairly simple particle collisions demand equations containing tens of thousands of terms , which are written using a strategy devised by the famous physicist Richard Feynman in the 1940s .
Almost all of those terms end up canceling out , but you do n’t know in advance which will cancel , so you have to slog through all of them .
An alternative strategy inspired by twistors and strings captures symmetries that Feynman ’s approach does not , so it sheds the excess mathematical baggage from the outset .
Calculations that math whizzes once gave up on now take just a couple of weeks .
“ I ’m pretty sure Feynman would be quite pleased if he saw what we can do , ” says Zvi Bern of the University of California , Los Angeles .
The emerging theory of spacetime is still very tentative and so mathematically dense that even those physicists directly involved admit they can barely follow what is going on .
Theorists have yet to explain why , if spacetime is merely a construct , it nonetheless seems so real to us .
It must somehow take shape much as life springs from inanimate matter .
Whatever the process is , it cannot occur only on subatomic scales , because the concept of size must itself emerge .
It should be evident on all scales , everywhere around us , if only we know how to look .

LAS VEGAS – Attribution is one of the biggest problems on the internet when it comes to cyberwarfare .
How do you hold a nation responsible for malicious attacks if you can't determine whether the activity was state - sponsored ?
Retired General Michael Hayden , former director of the National Security Agency , said Thursday that one solution being discussed in government is to simply forget about trying to determine if the source of an attack is state - sponsored and hold nations responsible for malicious activity coming from their cyberspace .
His words were greeted with applause from the audience of computer security professionals .
" Since the price of entry is so low , and ... it 's difficult to prove state sponsorship , one of the thoughts ... is to just be uninterested in that distinction and to actually hold states responsible for that activity emanating from their cyberspace , " said Hayden during his keynote address at the Black Hat security conference .
" Whether you did [ the attack yourself ] or not , the consequences for that action [ coming from your country ] are the same . "
Asked later for examples of what the consequences to a nation might be , he suggested some kind of cyberexile , or a response that would thwart the flow of the internet from the suspect country in a way that would slow their cybercommerce and ability to communicate .
Hayden , who is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group , a security consultant company founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , focused his talk on cyberwarfare and acknowledged that the term is thrown " pretty much at anything unpleasant . "
He said the U.S. military does n't consider intelligence attacks acts of war but the kind of " normal espionage thing that routinely happens between states . "
" Without going into great detail , we 're actually pretty good at this , and the Chinese are n't the only ones doing this , " he said .
Outside of this , the U.S. and international community have n't made much progress in determining what would actually constitute an act of war in this domain , but he said there have been some initial discussions about the idea of having global agreements to restrict certain kinds of activity .
He cited denial - of - service attacks as an example of one type that could be restricted under a kind of Geneva Convention agreement on the rules of cyberwar .
" That is such an easily available weapon that we [ might decide we ] ought to stigmatize its use so that adult nations do n't do it and they do n't allow it to happen from their sovereign space – that 's one thought , " he said .
He also said ideas have been raised about forming the cyber equivalent of demilitarized zones for sensitive networks , such as the power grid and financial networks , that would be off - limits to attack from nation states .
He acknowledged that this contradicts the view in kinetic warfare where attacks on power grids and other infrastructures are considered legitimate targets .
In a press conference following his talk , Hayden was asked about cyberespionage and whether the United States considers collateral damage that could occur as a result of such activity by the United States , such as an incident that reportedly occurred in the early ' 80s in Russia .
In 1982 , the United States reportedly sabotaged the Siberian pipeline through a logic bomb planted in software , causing an explosion .
The United States learned from a Russian scientist that the Soviets were stealing data on U.S. technology , so the CIA hatched a plot to insert the logic bomb into software headed to Russia to operate pumps , valves and turbines on the Siberian natural gas pipeline .
At a pre-programmed time , the malware caused excessive gas pressure to build on the valves , resulting in an explosion that was captured by orbiting satellites .
Although there were no human casualties , there might have been under different circumstances if the explosion had occurred in a populated area .
Hayden acknowledged during his keynote that there are problems with anticipating consequences of cyberwarfare attacks .
" You can never do anything in this domain without something going pop in [ the physical world ] , " he said .
" At the end of the day , it really is n't a videogame and something 's going to happen in somebody 's physical space . "
He added that in considering the possibilities for collateral damage from a cyberattack , generally the military considers whether the good that is perceived to come out of an action greatly outweighs the possible unintended consequences .
But with cyberattacks , the consequences can be much less predictable .
" When you do this , are lights still going to be on on the eastern seaboard ? " he said .
" When you do something in the cyberdomain , you 're asking a policy maker to accept a risk that 's probably a little less measurable than a parallel operation outside of cyberspace ....
The thinking on cyberstuff is so immature that , if we 're not careful , they 'll become the special weapon of the 21st century like nuclear weapons were [ in the last century ] that you really had to have the president in the room before you could use them . "
Hayden was asked about WikiLeaks and the possible repercussions that will come from the secret - spilling site publishing 77,000 intelligence documents on the Afghanistan war .
" This is an interesting aspect of a cyberwar [ that ] would not exist in physical space , " he said .
" So , how now do we deal with this ?
Can we sustain espionage ?
Will it be possible for America to spy if this cultural trend is not modified or muted ...?
We have less control of our secrets than some other states . "
Hayden said the intelligence community will likely push back against open intelligence - sharing initiatives that evidently made this and other documents published by WikiLeaks vulnerable to leaking .
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the government made the sharing of intelligence easier in order to combat criticism that people responsible for defending the country did n't have the information they needed .
As a result , intelligence reports and documents were made available to a much wider group of people in the government and military .
Hayden said " it 's going to take very strong leadership " to ensure that there is n't a knee - jerk reaction that simply closes access to intelligence going forward . "

As of this writing , it looks like Motorola is on the fence regarding a future update to Android 2.2 , as it relates to the Milestone .
It just got Android 2.1 , so we can see where Motorola is coming from .
That ’s from a logic standpoint .
But , from the much healthier standpoint of wanting the most current software on our device at all times , we ’re wondering what they ’re thinking .
Thankfully , though , we ’ve got a great development community out there — and here you have Android 2.2 , in build FRF91 — which has already made the rounds over plenty of devices already .
Of course , we all know that the Milestone is locked down .
It uses the same eFuse technology that became so shockingly famous over the release of the Droid X the last couple of weeks .
But , that ’s not stopping the 7 months of hard work since its release .
There ’s something to do with “ second boots ” that we ’re honestly going to say we ’re not sure the details of , but it works , and Froyo is definitely running on a Motorola Milestone .

The seven best things created in 1980 :
1. Intergalactic daddy issues
2 . Good folk punk
3. Grilled pizza
4. My friend Clayton Martin
5. Anti-jaundice shots
6 . The world 's second - best time waster
7. Tom Selleck 's mustache
As interesting as the other six may be , today we 're here to talk about number 3 .
For my money , grilling pizza is by far the best way to cook pizza at home .
It 's the only method that consistently delivers the crisp , blistered crust that the best pizzerias achieve .
Invented at Al Forno in Providence , Rhode Island , in 1980 , the process itself is so simple and its benefits so obvious once you taste the pies that it 's frankly unbelievable to me that they did n't exist centuries if not millennia ago .
Granted , grilled flatbreads are not a new thing , but still , to combine them with tomato , cheese , and good olive oil is just such a good idea .
The basic theory is easy .
Take a round of pizza dough , expose it to the intense heat of a grill , flip it , top it , char the bottom , and serve .
Because grills can reach upwards of 600 °F and emit radiant energy like a motherfu**er , the pizzas bubble , crisp , and char in about 45 seconds flat per side .
That 's timing that rivals the hottest wood - burning oven , and just like those pizzas , the result is a crust that is soft and chewy in the center , with a crisp , crackly shell that 's deeply charred in spots — especially if you go all out and make it with the finely milled Italian type " 00 " flour .
Have you ever seen anything this spotty - yummy come out of a home oven ?
There Are a Couple of Snags — Here 's How to Work Around Them
1 . There is no heat source on top of the pies .
This means that you have to reverse the order of the toppings , placing the cheese directly against the freshly charred crust so that it melts properly .
The tomato sauce ( I prefer a simple uncooked sauce of salted canned San Marzanos ) has to be applied in dollops so that the melty cheese can show through .
2 . It also means that toppings that require cooking must be precooked and added hot — say , sausage chunks or spinach leaves .
Additionally , salumi like soppressata or pepperoni will not get the deliciously crisp edges that they do in a normal oven .
As a crust lover , personally , It 's a trade off I 'm willing to make .
Finally , just like a good stir fry , mise en place is all - important .
These things cook fast , so have all of your tools and ingredients on hand before you throw the first piece of dough on the grill .
Follow our recipe for grilled pizza for exact timing and measurements or , if think you 've got a good dough and sauce of your own , head into the sideshow above for a quick visual breakdown of the process .

Based on initial press reports , the leaking of “ 90,000 classified documents ” related to the Afghanistan war does n’t really tell us much that we do n’t already know .
Our Afghan partners are less than reliable .
Nation - building is a painstakingly slow enterprise .
At least some Pakistanis are playing a double game .
NATO forces continue to kill non-combatants , despite universal acknowledgment that doing so alienates the people whose affections we are desperate to win .
The insurgents are on the march .
Who , if anyone , is likely to find any of this news ?
Does it come as a shocking revelation to learn that U. S. special operations forces are conducting secret raids aimed at eliminating Taliban leaders ?
The leaks are unlikely to affect the course of events on the ground .
However , they may well affect the debate over the war here at home .
In that regard , the effect is likely to be pernicious , intensifying the already existing inclination to focus on peripheral matters while ignoring vastly more important ones .
For months on end , Washington has fixated on this question : what , oh what , are we to do about Afghanistan ?
Implicit in the question are at least two assumptions : first , that something must be done ; and , second , that if the United States and its allies can just devise the right approach ( or assign the right general ) , then surely something can be done .
Both assumptions are highly dubious .
To indulge them is to avoid the question that should rightly claim Washington ’s attention :
What exactly is the point of the Afghanistan war ?
The point cannot be to “ prevent another 9/11 , ” since violent anti-Western jihadists are by no means confined to or even concentrated in Afghanistan .
Even if we were to “ win ” in Afghanistan tomorrow , the jihadist threat would persist .
If anything , staying in Afghanistan probably exacerbates that threat .
So tell me again : why exactly are we there ?
The real significance of the Wikileaks action is of a different character altogether : it shows how rapidly and drastically the notion of “ information warfare ” is changing .
Rather than being defined as actions undertaken by a government to influence the perception of reality , information warfare now includes actions taken by disaffected functionaries within government to discredit the officially approved view of reality .
This action is the handiwork of subversives , perhaps soldiers , perhaps civilians .
Within our own national security apparatus , a second insurgent campaign may well have begun .
Its purpose : bring America ’s longest war to an end .
Given the realities of the digital age , this second insurgency may well prove at least as difficult to suppress as the one that preoccupies General Petraeus in Kabul .
Using meat as “ buns . ”
Adding an extra sandwich — or two .
Making anything a “ footlong . ”
What results from these tricks of the fast food world are n’t examples of food ; they ’re freak gimmicks of a cheap ’n ’easy system of calorie production .
But that does n’t stop hoards of people from gobbling them up with glee and extra “ special sauce ” dribbling down their chins .
Chain restaurants usually offer their Frankenfood inventions for “ a limited time only , ” but the effects on people ’s health and on the health of the planet stick around for a lot longer .
Feast your eyes on some of the most recent food bastards and let us know in the comments area below what creations we might have missed .
KFC Double Down
In the run-up to its much - rumored release , the Double Down was hailed with the words : “ It ’s real . ”
While this legendary , lard - laden fast food creation needs no explaining , we still feel a little upchuck coming on every time we run across it .
Some cheeky vegans got a hold of the Double Down and turned it into an animal - free meal with a much more apt tagline : “ It ’s fake . ”

To deal with a problem , the first thing we have to do is to understand the problem .
This means that we have to be able to measure all meaningful aspects of the problem .
If we consider the problem of online fraud , it is encouraging that there has been substantial progress in understanding phishing and how malware is used to steal credentials , documents and money .
But , strikingly , almost nothing is known about Nigerian scams ( also known as advance fee fraud and 419 scams - 419 is a section under the Nigerian Criminal Code Act that prohibits obtaining goods by false pretences ) .
This makes it harder to defend against this increasingly common type of fraud , and almost impossible to predict the extent to which it may become worse onwards .
We designed and performed an experiment that allows us to take the pulse on Nigerian scammers .
Are the scammers really from Nigeria , you may begin to ask ?
What do they want , and how do they get it ?
What are their strengths , what are their weaknesses ?
Are they at the peak of their success , or should we fear that they can become dramatically better at what they are doing ?
What can organizations do to secure themselves and their users ?
Here is the experiment in a nutshell .
Imagine a camera that sells for $ 750 new , and I offer one for sale on Craigslist for $ 250 .
Only used for a few weeks , in perfect condition .
Good deal , right ?
But what if I instead were to ask $ 750 ( or more ) for it used ?
Not so hot , you might say .
It makes more sense for you to buy it in the store .
You would not bother contacting me .
But fraudsters would .
They may contact me and ask to buy it - even at a premium .
They will tell me where to ship it , and they will send me a payment .
Or rather : something that looks like a payment to a would - be victim , who would not realize that it really was not a payment until after the camera was shipped .
We used the technique of offering too expensive merchandise to find fraudsters without bothering honest people .
In fact , we used it to make the fraudsters find us , while avoiding everybody else .
Then we acted as would - be victims , and paid attention to what happened .
Here are some of our findings :
Nigerian scams are aptly named .
Indeed , almost all of the fraudsters we interacted with wanted us to ship our merchandise to an address in Nigeria .
Knowing this may help a little in designing countermeasures , whether legal or technical .
Most Nigerian scammers " pay " using PayPal .
Then they send an email that looks a lot like a PayPal payment notification .
But , interestingly , they do not spoof emails .
If they were , which would be very easy , they would no doubt increase their yield .
Some Nigerian scammers " pay " using Western Union .
Then they send a confirmation code that lets the seller pick up the money - but with some digits starred out .
" When you send me the tracking number , I will send you the missing part , and you can pick up the payment . "
Some Nigerian scammers " pay " using Credit Cards .
They request the victim 's credit card details so that they can " transfer " the money to his or her account .
Nigerian scammers are bullies .
As a would - be victim has agreed to sell , but then expresses second thoughts , the scammer becomes mean and threatening .
He sends angry emails in all - caps ; tells the would - be victim that he or she will be blacklisted or reported ; he even sends a notification from a payment provider , stating that the would - be victim 's account has been revoked .
( This can only be undone by responding to the notification with your password . )
Nigerian scammers know what they want .
They want fancy cameras , but do not care as much for laptops , and do not give a darn about refrigerators and other bulky electronic appliances .
It makes sense :
The merchandise needs to be shipped to them , and then be resold in Nigeria .
Knowing that the scammers remain in business , we can infer that they are reasonably successful .
In fact , we see more and more Nigerian scams .
So we can conclude that there are enough people who are not very careful , and that bullying them pays off .
This is not about people lacking technological skills , it is about them not thinking critically .
User awareness and education campaigns could change that .
Of course , Nigerian scams are not limited to Craigslist , nor to frauds in which they try to obtain people 's cameras for free .
Our experiment only gives us a glimpse at one particular type of scam at one particular point in time .
But it gives us hope that it is possible to create a taxonomy of scams and scammers , and develop tools and campaigns that hurt their bottom line .
NEW YORK ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ US banking giant JPMorgan Chase on Thursday announced a net profit of 4.8 billion dollars in the second quarter , up nearly 80 percent from the same period last year .
Reporting solid performance across most business areas , the New York - based bank ’s profits included 1.5 billion dollars that had been set aside to cover bad loans .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We continue to aggressively do all that we can reasonably and responsibly to contribute to the economic recovery , ” said CEO Jamie Dimon .
Earnings were “ partially offset by a charge of 550 million dollars for the UK bonus tax , ” said Dimon , adding that upcoming US financial reform also posed potential pitfalls for the firm .
“ Many challenges and uncertainties remain which may result in unintended consequences for our clients , the markets and our businesses , ” he said .
“ Increased focus is critical in order to implement these reforms in a way that protects consumers and the competitiveness of the US financial system . ”
JPMorgan is the first large US bank to report second quarter earnings .
ADVERTISEMENT
The announcement sent shares in the firm almost one percent higher in pre-opening trades .
But it was not all good news from the bank , which reported profits were down in its investment banking business .
That loss was more than offset by a surge in retail financial services , which saw a net profit of one billion dollars , versus 15 million dollars in the same period last year .
ADVERTISEMENT
The bank took a 25 billion dollar bailout from the US government at the height of the financial crisis .
It has since repaid that sum , and last year saw its profits double for the full year to 11.7 billion dollars .
The state of California will have its first - ever Asian American chief justice this year if the nomination by the Governator , Arnold Schwarzenegger , goes through as expected .
And she will be a woman , tipping the balance of the court to a woman majority for the first time in state history .
Talk about an old gal ’s club .
Schwarzenegger has nominated Tani Cantil - Sakauye , a 20 - year veteran justice and mother of two , to the highest role in the state ’s court system .
Legal scholars expect Cantil - Sakauye ’s nomination to pass easily through the State Bar and Commission on Judicial Appointments .
If all goes well , expect to see her name on the Nov. 2 ballot , where the voters must endorse her .
California may thus be joining the ranks of Tennessee , Wisconsin and Michigan – the only other states with women - in - the - majority top courts .
But do n’t stop there , California !
The Golden State is still sorely lacking in equitable racial representation on its Supreme Court .
In a state where more than one third of residents are Latino , the top court includes only a single Hispanic justice .
African Americans , who make up nearly seven percent of California ’s population , are unrepresented entirely .
With the addition of Cantil - Sakauye , the court will boast three Asian American justices , exceeding representation of that group ’s population in the state .
Though tokenistic racial representation alone may not improve legal decision making , the representation of a diversity of life experiences most certainly can .
A jury of one ’s peers must include faces , colors and lives representative of every body passing through a court .
The forthcoming issue of Ms. magazine features a map of the U.S. showing where gavel - wielding women rule the high court .
When we went to press , 20 states could boast a woman chief justice ; now our map can include California as well .

After months of speculation , Mini and Prodrive will announce a World Rally Championship programme this week , according to AUTOSPORT 's sources .
Mini's first - ever World Rally Car , which will be based on the Countryman road car , has been in preparation for months at Prodrive 's Banbury base and the BMW 1.6 - litre turbocharged engine recently arrived to turn a rolling shell into a full World Rally Car .
Testing of the new machine is expected to begin soon and , as technical director David Lapworth said , once it starts testing it will not stop .
" When we start testing on our rally car development programme , it will be intensive , " said Lapworth .
" We still have a good timescale to work towards for testing and we 're happy with where we 're at . "
Some sources have indicated Mini will formally launch the car in Rome just ahead of the Rally d'Italia - Sardegna in May next season - the car is not expected to compete in any of the first four rounds of next year 's World Rally Championship .
Prodrive has remained tight - lipped about any announcement this week , denying that it has anything planned .
The British preparation firm has yet to even admit to any kind of agreement with BMW or Mini - even though AUTOSPORT broke the story of Mini 's return to rallying 's highest level in August last year .
Norwegian driver Mads Ostberg is being tipped to do some of the early development driving - and to take one of the factory seats in next year 's WRC programme .
Ostberg is a long - standing customer of Prodrive and is expected to run a Mini - based team in next year 's WRC as well as driving an official car .
Ostberg has resisted the opportunity to drive any other cars in the WRC or Intercontinental Rally Challenge this season - including a Peugeot 207 S2000 after a test attended by Sebastien Loeb - out of loyalty to Prodrive .
Kitchen " tips " and habits made up a big percentage of things we discovered we were doing wrong .

Peter Aitken put together a great page with a number of common kitchen myths and the reasons why they 're misunderstood .
Some of them you may already have cast aside , but many are hard - and - fast laws , passed down through generations , that refuse to stand up to science .
Including the ever - popular orange box :
A box of baking soda in the fridge or freezer absorbs odors
This is a very clever and successful marketing ploy by the baking soda people , but the fact is that baking soda is very poor at absorbing odors .
It seems to make sense , however , so lots of people have spent untold billions of dollars to put boxes of baking soda in their fridge or freezer to no effect .
Activated charcoal would work much better but is expensive .
Better to wrap your food and clean the fridge once in a while .

Many details remain to be established about the Israeli commando assault on the Mavi Marmara - the lead ship in a flotilla intent on carrying humanitarian aid to the Gaza strip - in the early hours of 31 May 2010 .
But whatever the investigation of the incident ultimately reveals , the killing of nine human - rights activists bears witness to two related developments : the increasing politiciisation of humanitarian aid , and the growing sense of threat that the Israeli government seems to feel from human - rights organisations and international law .
The humanitarian minimum
Since human - rights workers and humanitarian groups emerged in the field of international conflict , they have been the targets of repressive regimes or violent militias , who often interpret the provision of relief and assistance to civilians as intervention on behalf of the enemy .
Aid convoys to the ” other side ” have routinely been attacked or hijacked , staff kidnapped or killed , hospitals and compounds seized and destroyed .
When shelter , medicine , and food are seen as interventions , it means that control over the conditions of civilian life has become one of the weapons in the conflict .
Humanitarianism is in a strict sense grounded in the principles of neutrality , impartiality , and commitment , first and foremost , to the civilian victims of conflict .
However , aid workers are not always successful in convincing fighters of their independence , and sometimes themselves blur the border between support for victims and support of a political cause .
Furthermore , when the pursuit of a military strategy ( such as a state of siege ) entails and / or is designed to affect the quality of civilian life , the provision of aid can become an element in a politico - military calculation .
When aid is thus politicised it can easily become a target for all parties in a conflict .
As Toni Pfanner of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) noted in 2005 : ” recent attacks on humanitarian organisations , including the ICRC , both in Iraq and in Afghanistan have shown that humanitarian relief may be contrary to the belligerents ' interests or , even worse , that attacks on humanitarian workers may foster their agenda . "
But with very few exceptions , direct and intentional attacks on aid workers or human - rights advocates have hitherto been largely the work of undisciplined militias , ragged armies , criminal gangs , and police - states .
The perpetrators have included the Taliban , the Bosnian Serb army , Iraqi insurgents , and the organisers of Latin America ’s “ dirty wars ” .
Now , with the lethal raid on the Mavi Marmara , is Israel in this respect following in their footsteps ?
The double logic
To answer this question , it is necessary to rewind .
The attack in the Mediterranean - albeit it was followed on 5 June by a non-violent prevention of the later attempt to deliver supplies to Gaza via the MV Rachel Corrie - represents the violent culmination of a process in which the Israeli government , and various private proxy groups , have come to see humanitarian and human - rights groups , and even international humanitarian law itself , as an " enemy " of or a threat to the existence of the state .
In this context , the fact that navy commandos used lethal force to “ defend their nation ” from an aid convoy should perhaps not be a surprise .
Before the departure of the Mavi Marmara - led flotilla , Israel ’s deputy foreign minister Danny Ayalon declared that " there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza " and therefore that the flotilla was not a relief mission in fact but " a provocation intended to delegitimise Israel " ( the Israeli government press office even emailed copies of a Gaza restaurant menu to reporters . )
After the attack , Ayalon 's description of the flotilla as an " armada of hate and violence in support of the Hamas terror organisation " was simply the ratification of this more general Israeli government interpretation of civil - society activists , at sea and on land .
The process is more complex , however .
The vigorous current discussion around the politics of humanitarianism provides evidence for the case that aid can indeed be politically motivated and manipulated by both its givers and its receivers .
It is in this connection that the apparently inverse phenomenon of attempts by powerful states to instrumentalise or monopolise the construction of humanitarian space and the delivery of aid can be understood .
The Israeli government ’s attempt to " manage " the humanitarian situation in the Gaza strip as an instrument of state policy belongs to this modern history of instrumentalisation ( whose precedents include the refugee - camps across the border from Kosovo during the Nato air - campaign there in 1999 ) .
This regulation of the flow of cross - border aid for political purposes has been echoed , in reverse , in the increasingly partisan rhetoric of some aid organisations , as some of the statements from the activists on Gaza flotilla testify .
The closure policy of Gaza is regulated , after a decision in January 2008 by the Israeli high court of justice , by a policy through which the state assumes the responsibility of providing the inhabitants with a " humanitarian minimum " meant to forestall the possibility of a humanitarian crisis developing - but no more than that .
Dov Weisglass , adviser to former prime minister Ehud Olmert , explained the rationale : " The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet , but not to make them die of hunger . "
In June 2009 the newspaper Ha'aretz published an Israeli document entitled " Red Lines " which specifies precisely the number of calories allowed to enter the strip , organised according to gender and age , at a level just above the United Nations 's definition of hunger .
The control of these supplies provides Israel with political leverage , but it can only be maintained if goods pass through its borders rather than through underground tunnels or from the sea .
In this sense , the attack on the Gaza flotilla obeyed a complex logic : it confirmed in practice the definition of humanitarian and human - rights activists as enemies of the state , and it reaffirmed the state 's attempt to manage the humanitarian situation in Gaza as a instrument of policy .
The next enemy
The current campaign began in summer 2009 , in the wake of a number of reports from human - rights organisations challenging the conduct of the Israeli military in Operation Cast Lead , its three - week assault on Gaza in December 2008 - January 2009 .
The new government of prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu - who had consolidated his hardline reputation during an earlier term in 1996 - 99 - seemed to react to the reports , their authors , and their logic with unusual severity .
" We are going to dedicate time and manpower to combating these groups ; we are not going to be sitting ducks in a pond for the human - rights groups to shoot at us with impunity " , Ron Dermer , director of policy planning in the prime - minister 's office told the Jerusalem Post in July 2009 .
" Every NGO that participates in this adds fuel to the fire and is serving the cause of Hamas " , he said .
" This is exactly what Hamas wants to do . "
In August 2009 , Moshe Ya'alon - the minister of strategic affairs , and a former Israeli Defence Forces ( IDF ) chief - of - staff - declared in a meeting with settlers that the activists of Peace Now represented a " virus " .
“ We again are dealing with the issue of the virus , Peace Now - the elitists , if you may - who have incurred great damage . "
Although he was reprimanded by the prime minister for the remark , Ya'alon 's phrase - especially following Dermer 's militant words - set the tone of the campaign that has since unfolded .
It came into its own after the publication of the report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict ( under the chairmanship of the South African judge Richard Goldstone ) to the UN ’s Human Rights Council ) in September .
The report concluded that there was evidence indicating that serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law had been committed by Israel ( and Hamas ) during the Gaza conflict , and that Israel committed actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly crimes against humanity .
The Israeli government could in principle have simply ignored the report , or dismissed it by attributing it to the usual " anti-Israeli " suspects .
Instead it took the charges extremely seriously , although not in the way the commission might have hoped .
The Netanyahu government decided to " combat " both the Goldstone report and the entire phenomenon which it saw the document as exemplifying – something it referred to variably as " Goldstonism " and the " Goldstone effect " , which it understands as an international tendency to delegitimise Israel , denying its right to exist .
Binyamin Netanyahu himself , in a November 2009 lecture at the Saban Forum , one of Israel 's leading security - studies institutes , identified three strategic threats facing Israel .
The first of these so - called " three challenges to Israel 's security " , he explained , was " a nuclear Iran " , which has threatened to " wipe Israel off the map . "
The second was cross - border " missile and rocket attacks " from Islamist militant organisations such as Hamas and Hizbollah .
What was the third after these first two formidable , if classic , opponents ?
" The third challenge to peace is the attempt to deny Israel the right to self - defence .
The UN Goldstone report on Gaza attempts to do that . "
The logic of this argument is far - reaching .
Binyamin Netanyahu was quick to emphasise that it is not simply Justice Goldstone or any particular organisation or report which constitutes the threat , nor is Israel its sole target ( " Be assured that this UN report is not Israel 's problem alone .
It threatens to handcuff all states fighting terrorism . " )
The problem is more too , Netanyahu suggested , than simply an ideologically - or politically - motivated abuse of international humanitarian law ( the so - called laws of war ) .
Rather , it is the current definition itself of this law , which he argued gave undue protection to " terrorists embedded in civilian areas [ who ] deliberately launch attacks on the innocent " and thus undermined the legal and moral position of the states which fight against them .
In response , Israel ’s prime minister called for a radical rewriting of IHL to address the " threat . "
" Paradoxically " , he said , " it is possible that the firm response of important international leaders and jurists to this morally twisted report will accelerate the re-examination of the laws of war in an age of terror . "
It is one thing to criticise the Geneva conventions or IHL .
It is yet another thing to violate or ignore them .
States and non-state actors do both of these things all the time .
It is third , and a rather different thing , to construe IHL itself , and its advocates , as a threat to the existence of a state , and to initiate a systematic process of combating them .
But this interpretation , advanced now quite routinely by the Israeli government , might explain why legal opinions such as the Goldstone report - which would limit Israel 's capacity to act " disproportionally " - could be seen as an existential threat .
The enemies within
In this light , perhaps the raid on the Mavi Marmara demonstrates what the Israeli government might mean by the end of " impunity " for human - rights NGOs and other international activists , and by granting them a new status as a strategic threat on a par with Iranian nuclear weapons or thousands of missiles and rockets .
In January 2010 a leading Israeli think - tank , the Reut Institute , worried about what it called the " delegitimation war " .
Its director , Gidi Grinstein , wrote in Ha'aretz : " Our politicians and military personnel are threatened with lawsuits and arrest when they travel abroad , campaigns to boycott our products gain traction , and our very existence is challenged in academic institutions and intellectual circles .
The country is increasingly isolated .
To date , Israel has failed to recognise these trends for the strategically significant , potentially existential , threat they constitute " ( see Gidi Grinstein , “ Israel delegitizers threaten its existence ” , Ha’aretz , 14 January 2010 ) .
Perhaps the " recognition " has now happened .
The Israeli government and a group of proxy organisations have launched a multi-pronged project of " counter - delegitimisation " , directed at humanitarian and human - rights NGOs .
They seek , in the words of one of its participants , " to end the practice used by certain self - declared ' humanitarian NGOs ' of exploiting the label ' universal human rights values ' to promote politically and ideologically motivated anti-Israel agendas . "
Likewise , Israeli groups have launched campaigns against the New Israel Fund , a United States - based organisation that funds civil - society activists in Israel and which has been accused ( as have the NGOs it has funded ) of undermining the foundations of the state by contributing to the research behind the Goldstone commission report .
This recent atmosphere contributed to two recent high - level political decisions in Israel : the Knesset ’s overwhelming vote in February 2010 to pass a law depriving groups that receive support from foreign governments ( as most human - rights and humanitarian groups do ) of their tax - exempt status , and thus their ability to raise money abroad ; and the proposal of a new law in April that sought to close down NGOs involved in bringing legal proceedings against Israeli government officials or military officers abroad .
The military , for its own part , has started confronting international activists with renewed vigour and zeal .
It has recently developed a practice of invading Palestinian towns to arrest not militants but international activists ( mainly European members of the International Solidarity Movement ) .
Many other activists do not even get the chance to enter , having been turned around at the border or held in the new detention facility built in the Tel Aviv airport for this purpose .
In a public letter released at the end of January 2010 , a group of thirteen Israeli human - rights organisations called on the government to " denounce the increasing assaults on the human rights and social change organisations in Israel . "
It cited " a series of invective comments by various officials who wish to delegitimise the civil society organisations who work for human rights and social change "
( The authors at this point would like to express thanks for the work of ACRI 's director Hagai El - Ad ) .
Buried among the citations were words attributed to Moshe Ya'alon , who was quoted as saying of human - rights organisations : “ your enemies will come from within ” .
In this mindset , international NGOs presumably would be the “ enemies from without ” .
The threat of law
The notion that the Mavi Marmara - led flotilla itself and the activists on it were designated as enemies could help explain why a full - scale military operation was ordered against a humanitarian mission ( after all , several ships carrying humanitarian aid had been allowed into Gaza in previous years ) ; and why , even when resistance from some of the ship 's passengers to the takeover seem to have turned violent , the soldiers ' response was so disproportionate .
But what is harder to explain is why the designation happened in the first place .
That militias , bandits , terrorists , and pirates seek to threaten or kill human - rights activists and humanitarian - aid workers seems easy to comprehend , however reprehensible their actions .
But it remains somewhat mysterious that a state which insists it is the only one upholding human rights and democracy in the neighbourhood would decide to " combat " them so directly .
Why the assaults , and why the worry ?
One of the most frequent and powerful critiques of international war - crimes law is that it is too often only applied to the weakest parties in a conflict .
The International Criminal Court , as Guénaël Mettraux points out , " has thus far only indicted Africans . "
International criminal law , he writes , " remains to a large extent le droit des autres , a set of rules that we seem content to apply to others , but not to ourselves .
The ' others ' are those , states and individuals , who have lost the political muscle to pre-empt or resist the application of that regime to them " ( see Guénaël Mettraux , “ International Justice - For Others ” , International Herald Tribune , 1 June 2010 ) .
The powerful states , it would seem , can simply get away with violations of the laws of war , and barely even need to worry about the bad publicity .
While the United States was hiding “ ghost ” detainees from the Red Cross and subjecting them to “ advanced interrogation techniques ” , its officials were loudly - if anonymously - advertising the use of those methods in leaked stories on the frontpages of major newspapers .
They did not appear terribly worried about the potential legal consequences .
Similarly , when Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni told Radio Reshet Bet during the war in Gaza that " Israel is … a country that when you fire on its citizens it responds by going wild – and this is a good thing " , she seemed to promote with pride the sheer disproportion of the military operation then underway .
But when that very quotation appeared as the centrepiece of the Goldstone commission 's report , the government reacted with outrage , and some fear about possible war - crimes charges .
At a moment when questions of humanitarianism and human rights have become a major stake in the conflict , the battle - space has expanded to include them , discursively and physically .
There are two available interpretations of this trend and the campaign which it has spawned , apparently including the violent raid on the aid flotilla on 31 May 2010 .
The Israeli government 's reaction to the strategic threat posed by international humanitarian law , and its advocates , might suggest ( first ) that it fears it belongs to the “ others ” - to those without the political force to resist the application of the law .
By contrast , the government ’s reaction might suggest ( second ) that with each passing day the extension of the law grows ; and that accountability for all before this law could become more of a reality , perhaps even sooner rather than later .
If Israel still seeks to rewrite international humanitarian law and to regulate humanitarian supplies as instruments of state power , and if some international organisations respond with increased legal challenges and others with more more ships on the seas , then the incident of the Mavi Marmara will be remembered as one of the opening shots in this emerging battle of law and aid .

Internet : Chris Gethard
The Upright Citizens Brigade is best known for the fantastic foursome ( though didja know Horatio Sanz was an original member in Chicago ? ) , but it ’s also enjoyed great success with its two theaters , one each in New York and Los Angeles .
Legions of malleable young comics can now subscribe to the UCB philosophy , which pushes fast and funny , down - and - dirty improv and sketch comedy .
Gethard is a child of the New York theater , and he ’s used its former - strip - club confines to refine his bizarre sensibilities .
He performs weekly with improv team The Stepfathers , occasionally with celebrity - studded ASSSSCAT , and has put on shows aboard buses and featuring boxing bouts .
He ’s also the force behind The Chris Gethard Show , a monthly late - night talk show featuring Gethard and his comic pals pulling odd stunts .
In one , he auctions off the chance to have a sleepover at his parents ’ house ; at another point he forces two straight male comics to go on a date .
He recently took his renegade sensibilities to Comedy Central as the host of Portable Lounge , a transient talk show that kicked off in a bowling alley with Saturday Night Live ’s Bobby Moynihan .
Gethard is set to star in Comedy Central ’s Big Lake sitcom in August , alongside Sanz and Chris Parnell , but for now it ’s nice to see an underdog get his due .
Here ’s that date video , which is pretty great :
He ’s also attempted to contact Diddy via , well , you ’ll see :

CD : Lewis Black , Stark Raving Black
Lewis Black has officially become an “ applause comic . ”
After years of refining his outsider - looking - in , hot - tempered act , Black ’s audience can see where jokes are going — and they like it .
The smallest proclamations about bad politicians making bad judgments get huge applause breaks — and given that Black plays almost exclusively large theaters now , that sporadic applause is a hiccup in the comic ’s momentum .
But Black wisely plays against expectations , sticking by premises that are more personal and refined in this , his eighth album .
He tackles his age ( just over 60 ) , then transitions into stories about his parents that reveal a ) where he got his disturbing sense of humor and b ) just how disturbing they still are , well into their nineties .
There ’s also talk of the financial meltdown , but Black spins these well - worn topics to reveal the aspects that personally insult him the most , like how one bank exec spent $ 1.5 million just to redecorate his office .
And , of course , his random angry snipes are a delight for their furor alone :
At one point , apropos of nothing , he yells , “ And if you ’re Twittering , fuck you . ”

Internet : Jordan Vogt - Roberts
There ’s something sweetly tragic about all of Jordan Vogt - Roberts ’ videos .
Characters look like fools , take themselves way too seriously , and generally wallow in humiliation .
Thus the comedy , even in a few short minutes , is heartbreaking and gut - busting , nuanced and uproarious .
His new series , Memoirs Of A Manchild ( starring Thomas Middleditch ) , speaks for all twentysomethings still unhealthily fixated on Legos and Star Wars toys .
And he completed a darkly comic short film , Successful Alcoholics , which recently appeared at the Independent Midwest Film Festival and the Just For Laughs Chicago fest .
It stars TJ Miller and Lizzy Caplan as barely functional boozehounds who all but destroy each other ’s lives , but Vogt - Roberts manages to milk the situation for some levity .
And when Vogt - Roberts brazenly embraces his silly side , the results turn heads .
When Miller auditioned for the Yogi Bear movie and had n’t heard back , he worked with Vogt - Roberts to shoot a mock audition video in which Miller interacts with a live bear ; the short landed Miller a role .
Vogt - Roberts has also created unusual “ mash - up ” videos — blending two words , like dub and subtitles into “ dubtitles , ” then demonstrating the word cinematically — and they ’ll feature prominently in a forthcoming Comedy Central special directed by Vogt - Roberts , featuring Miller , Kumail Nanjiani , Hannibal Buress , Matt Braunger , and Kyle Kinane .
All these videos are available on his website ( the Memoirs ones are “ The Lemonade Stand , ” “ Mint In Box , ” and “ Ages 4 And Up ” ) , but here ’s a treat from the archives , with most of his comedy pals in tow :

When assistive technology researcher Dr. Cliff Kushler contributed to the development of the T9 predictive text input system in the '90s , he helped pave the way for a major breakthrough in mobile messaging .
T9 became ubiquitous on feature phones and is still widely used today on mobile devices with conventional numeric keypads .
Kushler 's latest company , called Swype , offers an intriguing new spin on efficient text entry that could prove equally influential in the emerging era of touchscreen and motion - based input .
Kushler began developing the underlying technology behind Swype a few years after AOL acquired Tegic , the company that he originally cofounded to develop T9 .
Originally devised as head - tracking system and later adapted to touchscreens , the Swype keyboard allows the user to input text by moving a finger in a rapid sweeping motion over a qwerty keyboard , sliding in order over the letters that form the desired word .
The software will analyze the path of the user 's finger on the screen and compute possible word matches .
This system allows users to input an entire word without having to lift their finger from the touchscreen surface .
It offers a considerable boost in typing speed relative to conventional touchscreen keyboards .
Kushler began developing the Swype input system in 2001 , but it took years of research for it to reach its current level of maturity .
The technology was introduced to the public at the TechCrunch 50 conference in 2008 and soon attracted the interest of mobile device vendors .
The Swype input system is now available in 35 languages and has shipped on roughly 15 devices over the past six months .
Kushler is still heavily involved in the effort and serves as CTO of the Swype company .
Swype is working on an Android version of its keyboard , which is currently in the beta test stage .
Although the Android version is still relatively new , it has already been adopted by several prominent handset makers .
It will be available on Motorola 's upcoming Droid X smartphone and Samsung 's Galaxy S series .
I installed the downloadable beta version of Swype for Android on my Nexus One and have also tested it on a Droid X review unit that we recently received from Verizon .
After spending two weeks with the Swype software , I never want to go back to using a regular touchscreen keyboard .
It is a shockingly effective input system that tangibly increases typing speed and accuracy .
Instead of hitting each key individually , you just move your finger or thumb over the keys in succession .
The software will draw a line that follows your movements , tracing your finger through the keys .
When you lift your finger after tracing over a word , the software will compare the traced letters with the contents of its dictionary and look for a match .
For example , to type the word " write , " you press down on the " w " key , move your finger to the right all the way to the " i , " and then swerve back the way you came and end at the letter " e . "
The swift back - and - forth motion that is used to type that word with Swype can be performed much faster than hitting each key in sequence .
Typing the word " write " with Swype
The software is very permissive and will often still be able to compute accurate matches even if you missed a letter or veered a little bit off course .
This allows you to move faster because you do n't really have to be precise .
In cases where there are multiple potential matches ( like when you move your finger from the " p " in a left - hand direction to the letter " t " and it could spell either " put , " " pot , " or " pit " )
Swype will show you a list of words and you can simply tap the one you want .
Typing the word " put " with Swype
Obviously , this kind of predictive gesture - driven input will only work if the word that you are trying to type is already in the software 's dictionary .
This limitation is a bit problematic on smartphones , where users often have to type URLs , e-mail addresses , and other kinds of text strings that are n't in any dictionary .
In order to accommodate those kinds of usage scenarios , the Swype keyboard supports regular key - by - key typing in addition to its gesture system .
When you are typing a non-dictionary word , you just hit one key at a time instead of sweeping .
The words that you type in that manner will be added to Swype 's dictionary so that you will be able to input them with a sweep on subsequent uses .
For example , when I manually typed in " arstechnica.com " in the URL bar of the browser , it trained the keyboard to support typing " arstechnica " with a sweeping motion .
One of the most advantageous characteristics of Swype is that it works exceptionally well for one - handed input .
I can type very quickly with Swype when I 'm operating the phone with one hand by sliding my thumb over the keyboard .
I no longer have to rotate the device into landscape orientation and use both hands in order to type at a reasonable speed .
Next time that I 'm traveling and find myself at an airport , dragging my luggage with one hand and trying to respond to an e-mail with my phone in the other hand , Swype is going to make the experience much less painful .
I can also type quickly with Swype by holding it with one hand and performing the sweeping gestures with the index finger of their other hand .
The thumb and index finger methods are both comfortable for me and work equally well .
I find myself using the index - finger typing method more often on the enormous Droid X , because I 'm usually operating the large device with two hands anyway .
On the N1 , I generally use the one - handed thumb method instead of the index - finger method unless I just happen to pick it up with my left hand , which has a lot less thumb dexterity .
Swype offers several minor conveniences that help to further accelerate typing .
As Swype input is generally done one word at a time , there is often a need to be able to delete entire words while typing .
To delete an entire word rather than just a character , you press and hold the backspace key .
It will continue to delete entire words for as long as you hold it down .
This allows you to delete whole paragraphs rather quickly .
Another minor convenience is that you do n't have to hit the space bar between words .
After you input a word , you can just pick up your finger and start inputting the next word .
The software will automatically input a space between them .
Similarly , when you are presented with a set of options for possible word matches , the software will assume that you wanted the first one in the list if you just start inputting another word rather than selecting an item from the assortment .
In our put / pot / pit example above , you will notice that " put " is highlighted green and placed at the top of the list .
If I ignore the list and start inputting another word on the keyboard , it will automatically insert " put " before computing the new word .
I did some typing tests to compare my performance between Android 's standard touchscreen keyboard and the Swype keyboard .
I used the ExtremeTypist program , but disabled its eccentric Extreme mode .
I was able to get 74 characters during a test with the regular keyboard and I got 102 characters on my first try with Swype .
That 's with a relatively artificial set of words — I suspect that the measurable gap might widen further if I was typing a coherent sentence rather than random words .
One of the factors that makes Swype faster is that it largely insulates the user from typos .
With the regular touchscreen keyboard , I find myself fat - fingering the keys and having to use backspace to make corrections .
Swype still manages to figure out what I meant , even if I miss , so it gives me much higher accuracy .
Of course , the downside is that a typing error with Swype is more costly than a typing error with a regular keyboard because you will have to do the whole word over again rather than just redoing a single letter .
Some of the handset vendors that are licensing Swype include a quick - edit feature that makes it easier to go back and change a word .
This feature is not supported in the downloadable beta version that you can install on other Android handsets , however , because it requires modifications to Android 's input method system .
Although Swype improved my typing performance on a touchscreen , I 'm still faster with a physical slide - out qwerty keyboard .
I thumb - typed more articles than I care to admit on my old Touch Pro 2 — a device with a physical keyboard that I regard as the gold standard for smartphones .
Swype can't beat that , but it is definitely the best touchscreen keyboard I have ever used .
Even on devices with a good slide - out hardware keyboard , Swype would still be highly useful and relevant for situations where you want to do fast text input with one hand .
The future of Swype
I spoke with Swype CEO Mike McSherry to learn more about the underlying technology and the company 's plans for the future .
The algorithm that attempts to guess the correct word is implemented in C++ and is relatively portable .
This has made it practical for the developers to bring the Swype input system to multiple platforms .
It is supported today on Windows Mobile , Android , and Symbian .
The company is investigating a MeeGo port and intends to bring it to other platforms in the future .
Swype 's developers are also exploring the possibility of adapting the input system to work on other kinds of devices besides smartphones .
McSherry says that the basic principals behind the Swype input system will likely work well in any computing environment where you have a means of tracking the movement of a pointer over a surface — any screen that you can touch or point at .
For example , he thinks that it could be a perfect match for the motion - based control systems that are becoming popular on gaming consoles , such as the Nintendo Wii .
He also cited tablets , car computers , and televisions as other potential devices where the Swype technology could potentially be useful .
Mass - market consumer electronics are where Swype expects to find its biggest business opportunities , but McSherry commented that the company is also committed to developing effective input systems for people with disabilities — a goal that initially inspired Kushler to develop both Swype and T9 .
The small conveniences , high error tolerance , and excellent efficiency of the sweeping gestures really make Swype shine .
It 's a pleasure to use and requires very little acclimation time because the sweeping gestures feel extremely natural and intuitive for text input .
Swype is very impressive and is likely destined to become a must - have feature for smartphones .
We were a little shocked to learn in Panasonic 's latest press release that there are still people out there who rely on faxes .
For our younger readers , faxing is a means of transmitting images between two machines that make funny noises over phone lines .
Important documents were often transferred via those funny noises because the resulting quality was so low your signature and any other confidential info was made impossible to read on the resulting printout .
However , Panasonic 's new KX - PW821 shuns the paper altogether , allowing you to doodle something on the screen and then hit send to have it transmitted .
On the receiving end it can save a tree by writing faxes straight to SDHC storage and can store voicemails and full conversations as audio recordings , meaning this package could replace even the tape in your vintage answering machine .
No word on whether the tiny kendo student is included , however .
Holland progress – they shaded the contest , and took the initiative to try and win the game by throwing on an extra attacking player at half - time .
Both teams named the expected starting XIs , and both set out broadly as predicted in the preview .
Uruguay ’s midfield was a cross between a standard four - man system and a diamond , with Walter Gargano playing much further up the pitch than we are used to seeing him .
Alvaro Pereira stayed wide , whilst Diego Perez played a reserved role on the right .
The first half was a fairly tame affair – Holland ’s passing was slow and unadventurous , whilst Uruguay ’s pressing was very good .
Diego Forlan and Edinson Cavani chased the ball in the Dutch half whilst the other eight players stayed the other side of the halfway line , literally trying to prevent the ball coming into their half .
Uruguay were reasonably happy for their opponents to control the ball , as they have been throughout the tournament ; they have managed an average possession of just 40 % – a lower percentage than any team to have reached the quarter finals since 1966 , according to OPTA .
Equally , Holland were reasonably content to knock the ball around in non-threatening areas – again , this can be backed up with a stat from OPTA – only 53 % of Holland ’s passes have been in the opposition half at the tournament , the lowest of any team .
So what did we have ?
Holland holding onto the ball but doing little with it , Uruguay intent on playing defensively and not allowing Holland space to break into .
Mark van Bommel and Demy de Zeeuw were seeing plenty of the ball but failing to get it to the creative players , justifying Jonathan Wilson ’s description of Bert van Marwijk ’s side as “ team in which six players defend , three attack , and Dirk Kuyt runs about ” .
Robben threat
The immediate battle was in Uruguay ’s left - back zone .
As expected , Martin Caceres was fairly comfortable dealing with Arjen Robben coming inside onto his stronger foot , partly because Caceres is a centre - back , partly because he is right - footed .
Alvaro Pereira also did a good defensive job , dropping deep and doubling up quickly whenever Robben got the ball .
Uruguay ’s concern about Robben , identified as the main threat beforehand , and the lopsided nature of their midfield meant that Dirk Kuyt was constantly in space on the opposite flank , and he had a very good game .
Kuyt is a notoriously unselfish player who gets praised mostly because of his work rate , but equally his positional awareness is excellent .
That flank was noticeably more free for Holland to work in , and that may have contributed to the opening goal – although in fairness , it was all about a superb strike from Giovanni van Bronckhorst rather than anything to do with tactics .
Uruguay were slow to support the front two throughout , and the Forlan - Cavani partnership was often crowded out by the presence of six defensive - minded Dutch players .
It was basically up to those two alone to get goals , and it did n’t help that they only combined ( in terms of a pass from one to the other ) three times all game .
That said , they worked well for Uruguay ’s equaliser – Cavani ’s slight bit of movement created space for Forlan in the hole , and his swerving shot deceived Maarten Stekelenburg and ended up in the net .
Half - time change
At half - time , neither side were playing particularly good football , which was probably to Uruguay ’s advantage .
It was effectively a bore 0 - 0 with two excellent shots thrown in .
Holland were struggling to link defence and attack , whilst Uruguay were n’t getting enough men into the final third .
One reason for both those factors was Oscar Tabarez ’s use of Walter Gargano , usually a holding midfielder , in an advanced position .
He did a good defensive job high up the pitch , but never looked to support the two strikers , despite being the best - placed Uruguay player to do so .
Maybe with that in mind , van Marwijk made an attack - minded substitution at half - time .
He probably decided he did n’t need two holding midfielders against a side not looking to break from the centre of midfield , and removed de Zeeuw , putting Rafael van der Vaart on in his place to link the play .
This switched the team to something more like a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 , with Mark van Bommel on his own ahead of the defence .
Oscar Tabarez did n’t respond .
Did it work ?
Well , yes and no .
It meant Holland got the ball to their forward players more quickly and easily , and Holland retained the ball in more threatening positions .
However , it also meant that Kuyt and Wesley Sneijder were playing deeper than they had been previously , and therefore there seemed to be less of a direct goal threat from those two .
Robben remained pressed up high against Caceres .
Another knock - on effect was that Uruguay had more space to break into , with only one Dutch holding midfielder , and they were themselves looking more threatening in the second half .
That was , until Sneijder ’s fortunate goal – which deflected off a Uruguayan defender , narrowly avoided the ( possibly ) offside Robin Persie , before squeezing in off the far post .
This came after the Dutch had been looking under pressure – as Alvaro Pereira said after the match , “ The main difference was the timing of the Dutch goals .
They scored their second right in the middle of our best spell . ”
This may have been the case , but Uruguay never really forced the issue – in particular , they created nothing in wide areas .
Holland ’s two apparent weak links – Khalid Boulahrouz and van Bronckhorst – both had excellent games .
Holland seal it
The third goal was more pleasing on the eye – Kuyt again showed his positional awareness by keeping width on the left - hand side when other Dutch players were haring into the box .
He had time to cut back onto his right foot , before curling an inch - perfect cross over for Robben , who had made a run in from the opposite flank .
His header bounced in off the post – the third time Holland had scored via the woodwork in this game – and it looked to be game over .
Tabarez sent on another striker , Sebastian Abreu , in place of Alvaro Pereira , and Uruguay got a goal back in the 92nd minute with a neat strike from Maxi Pereira following a free - kick – a deserved goal for the Benfica player , who has provided a consistent threat from full - back in the competition .
A late scramble produced a tight finish but no final goalscoring opportunity , and Holland held on to record a famous victory .
Conclusion
This was a game decided by very fine margins , and despite Holland winning the game following a half - time change in formation , it ’s difficult to attribute too much of their success to tactics .
Nevertheless , with this being a Holland side that have been criticized for a perceived lack of adventure and flair , we should credit van Marwijk for a bold attacking move .
In the second half , Holland had five attacking players whilst Uruguay had only two , and the team who made more of an attempt to win the game prevailed .
Tabarez must rue the fact he had injuries and suspensions to cope with , limiting his tactical options .
It was a slight surprise that he did n’t reshape his side after van der Vaart ’s introduction , especially as his philosophy so far has been to adapt from game to game according to his opponents , but then Uruguay were on top before the goal went in .
Tabarez has proved himself to be an astute tactician at this competition , and a run to the semi-finals should be considered a success .

How ’d he do ?
As always , the answer seems to depend on where you ’re sitting .
Environmentalists were disappointed , centrists were pleased but skeptical , conservatives in the business sphere just want the problems solved so we can get back to business .
And the political right appeared to be responding to a completely different speech ( in an alternate universe in which Obama caused the oil leak and is now using that as an excuse to RAISE YOUR TAXES ! ) .
Editorial cartoonist Tom Toles ’ take ( next to this column ) appeared a few days ago , but pretty accurately sums up the reaction from Beltway Republicans .
( Read our summary of the main points of President Obama ’s speech )
Politico ( centerish , DC website )
“ His language was notably muscular – calling the spill an “ epidemic ” and an “ assault ’ on the Gulf , and his response a “ battle plan ” to fix it – and he sought to equate the level of the national response to triumphs past , such as World War II and the moon missions . ” [ social_buttons ]
Ezra Klein ( liberal , Washington Post ) :
Noting that Obama ’s use of language was similar to his calls for the final push for health care reform , Klein says environmentalists should be optimistic that the President is serious about getting a bill passed – even if he did n’t lay out any specifics .
He also did not utter the words “ climate change ” or “ global warming . ”
The closest Obama got was to praise the House for “ passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill – a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America ’s businesses . ”
The section of his speech devoted to the issue avoided the politically - controversial problem in order to focus on the broadly - popular solution : Clean energy …
Obama did not make any specific promises about the bill he would support , or even that he wanted .
He did not say he would price carbon , or that we should get a certain percentage of our energy from renewables by a certain date .
Joseph B. White ( conservative , Wall Street Journal )
Watch this trick : Obama endorses energy action without exactly endorsing the climate change / cap and trade bill passed by the House .
He ’s happy to look at other ideas .
Sounds like health care , Chapter 1 .
Ben Adler ( liberal , Newsweek )
“ Obama Chickens Out on Energy ” : President Obama eloquently laid out the case that we have failed to confront our dependence on fossil fuels , and that now is the time for us to do so .
Obama acknowledged that the our failure to do this so far has been caused not just obeisance to entrenched interests , but also “ a lack of political courage and candor . ”
But he failed to use this opportunity to marshal public support for a logical , tangible goal that would reduce our destructive consumption of oil and coal .
As Obama noted , he campaigned on , and the House of Representatives passed , a bill that would finally put a cap on U.S. carbon emissions .
So you would think that Obama must surely have gone on to note that the bill is now stuck in the Senate , where it has not gained the super - majority under the extra-constitutional requirement enforced in this Congress by Republicans and conservative Democrats .
You would be wrong .
Dave Roberts ( liberal , Grist magazine )
Normally Obama ’s energy pitch includes ritual nods to ‘ clean coal , ’ nuclear power , and domestic drilling .
None of those made an appearance last night ; it was only energy efficiency and renewable energy .
That strikes me as a deliberate ( and welcome ) message to the Senate about what Obama wants on the energy side of a bill .
Michael Steele ( conservative , chairman of the Republican Nation Committee )
“ Exploiting the tragedy in the Gulf to try to ram through a devastating job - killing national energy tax is more of the same Chicago - style politics that has the President ’s approval ratings plummeting to an all - time low . ”
How many irrelevant buzzwords can we fit into one sentence ?
This stuff may play well to the hard - core base of the party , but leaves independents who just want the problem taken care of scratching their heads …
Brian Wingfield ( conservative , Washington Bureau Chief for Forbes business magazine )
President Obama used his address to get his feet back under him .
But now the long journey to cleaning up the Gulf begins .
Erick Erickson ( conservative , RedState.com )
[ Obama ] hopes you will ignore what Steven Hayward has pointed out at AEI — very little crude oil goes into producing energy in America to keep lights on .
Most oil goes to fueling our cars .
Windmills , nuclear reactors , and solar panels will not fuel our cars .
If we do n’t extract the oil , we will grow more and more dependent on Hugo Chavez and Iranian President I ’manutjob .
I realize he does n’t want a crisis to go to waste , but his priorities are clearly not those of the rest of the nation .
Bill O’Reilly vs Sarah Palin ( conservative , Fox News )
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/QfTTckgn-mo&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0]
The Economist ( conservative , European weekly magazine )
In the end , I think there was n’t much the president could do to reassure the public in this speech .
He laid out the government ’s actions , which are substantial .
And yet the oil creeps closer to America ’s shores .
Thus , you get the president of a Louisiana parish wondering ( on CNN ) why it takes weeks instead of days to skim the oil .
“ We ’re working on it with everything we ’ve got , ” is not a satisfactory response for that man .
But that is essentially the response Mr Obama gave to America tonight .
It was the only response he could give .
The Economist ’s writer ( un - bylined , as is the magazine ’s tradition ) also mocked the American media ’s obsession with style , noting , “ The lack of profanity from Mr Obama is troubling .
It ’s as if he does n’t care . ”
Marc Ambinder ( center , The Atlantic magazine )
Whether he ’s taken command of the response is immaterial now ; it is now his spill to fix .
Obama ran for office on the promise of restoring Americans ’ faith in their government ’s ability to solve modern problems .
The economy aside , this is the biggest test of whether he can bend the curve of history in that direction .

Those of us who say that the stimulus was too small are often accused of after - the - fact rationalization : you said this would work , but now that it has n’t , you ’re just saying it was n’t big enough .
The quick answer to that accusation is that people like me said that the stimulus was too small in advance .
But the longer answer is that it ’s all in the math : Keynesian analysis provides numbers as well as qualitative predictions , and given reasonable projections of the economy ’s path in January 2009 , the proposed stimulus just was n’t big enough .
Let ’s go back to the tape , January 9 , 2009 :
Even the C.B.O. says , however , that “ economic output over the next two years will average 6.8 percent below its potential . ”
This translates into $ 2.1 trillion of lost production .
“ Our economy could fall $ 1 trillion short of its full capacity , ” declared Mr. Obama on Thursday .
Well , he was actually understating things .
To close a gap of more than $ 2 trillion — possibly a lot more , if the budget office projections turn out to be too optimistic — Mr. Obama offers a $ 775 billion plan .
And that ’s not enough .
Now , fiscal stimulus can sometimes have a “ multiplier ” effect :
In addition to the direct effects of , say , investment in infrastructure on demand , there can be a further indirect effect as higher incomes lead to higher consumer spending .
Standard estimates suggest that a dollar of public spending raises G.D.P. by around $ 1.50 .
But only about 60 percent of the Obama plan consists of public spending .
The rest consists of tax cuts — and many economists are skeptical about how much these tax cuts , especially the tax breaks for business , will actually do to boost spending .
( A number of Senate Democrats apparently share these doubts . )
Howard Gleckman of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center summed it up in the title of a recent blog posting : “ lots of buck , not much bang . ”
The bottom line is that the Obama plan is unlikely to close more than half of the looming output gap , and could easily end up doing less than a third of the job .
In practice , it was even worse , because one of the key elements of the plan — aid to state and local governments — was cut back sharply in the Senate .
We ended up with only about $ 600 billion of real stimulus over that two - year period .
So this was n’t a test of fiscal stimulus , even though it has played out that way in the political arena : the whole thing was obviously underpowered from the start .
But imagine if Palestinians stopped the rock - throwing and put female pacifists in the lead .
What if 1,000 women sat down peacefully on a road to block access to an illegal Jewish settlement built on Palestinian farmland ?
What if the women allowed themselves to be tear - gassed , beaten and arrested without a single rock being thrown ?
Those images would be on televisions around the world  particularly if hundreds more women marched in to replace those hauled away .

“ This is what Israel is most afraid of , ” said Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi , a prominent Palestinian who is calling for a nonviolent mass movement .
He says Palestinians need to create their own version of Gandhi ’s famous 1930 salt march .
One genuinely peaceful initiative is a local boycott of goods produced by Jewish settlements on the West Bank .
Another is the weekly demonstrations in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah against evictions of Palestinians there .
And in Gaza , some farmers have protested Israel ’s no - go security zones by publicly marching into those zones , even at the risk of being shot .
So far there is no Palestinian version of Martin Luther King Jr. But one candidate might be Ayed Morrar .
A balding , mild - mannered activist , he was the mastermind behind the most successful initiative so far : nonviolent demonstrations a half - dozen years ago in the West Bank village of Budrus against Israel ’s construction of a security fence there .
More than many other Palestinians , he has a shrewd sense of public relations .

RWA : You Can Drink The Water

Posted to : Breaking News , Environment , The Hill
( Updated ) New Haven should expect its water to stay brown through the heat wave , but most people should feel comfortable drinking it , according to the water authority .
The Regional Water Authority ( RWA ) scrambled Wednesday to respond to widespread concern about muddy water coming through the tap over the past two days , as a heat wave slammed the city .
Increased demand from homes and “ liberated ” fire hydrants ( such as the one in the video , in the Hill neighborhood ) led the water to turn brown , according to the RWA .
New Haven households reported the problem beginning Monday night .
Reports became widespread Tuesday and lasted into Wednesday morning .
Messages poured onto social networking sites Tuesday trying to figure out what was going on .
The brown water stretched across the city , with reports in East Rock , Fair Haven , Dwight , Wooster Square , Westville and downtown .
It reached the faucets of City Hall and the soda fountain at Sally ’s Apizza , according to contributors ’ posts .
After much speculation , the RWA issued a public announcement on its website Wednesday at 10 a.m. explaining the problem .
Spokeswoman Kate Powell said Wednesday that the dark color comes from sediment stirred up by extra - high water flow due to high demand .
Illegal open fire hydrants are a major draw on the system , she said .
The high flow of water “ scoured ” the water mains , scraping up sediment that is usually “ sitting happily ” in the pipes , Powell said .
The RWA suspects the sediment may contain zinc or manganese .
It is testing the brown water and expects to get results back today , Powell said .
Despite its “ unappealing ” appearance , the water is OK to drink , according to Powell .
“ It is not harmful , ” she said .
“ It is no different from the clear water , except that it has stuff floating around in it . ”
She stopped short of calling the water “ safe , ” because it may not be safe for people with compromised immune systems .
As of Wednesday , East Rockers reported their water had cleared up somewhat , but remained too dirty to use for washing white clothes .
City spokeswoman Jessica Mayorga said the RWA is handling the problem , not the city .
RWA gave several recommendations for what to do : “ It is a personal choice whether or not to use the discolored water for showering , flushing toilets , cleaning floors , etc .
“ To drink lightly discolored water , fill a container , put it in your refrigerator to cool and let the color settle to the bottom .
When ready to drink , use the clear water from the top of the container .
You should use caution if you wash clothes , especially light colored ones , in your washing machine .
Check the condition to your water to prevent staining . ”
The water wo n’t return to normal until the demand falls , Powell said .
The RWA serves water to 430,000 customers in 15 towns in southern Connecticut .
When the heat wave struck , demand jumped from 57 million gallons per day to 82 million gallons per day , Powell said .
She said the RWA received complaints from people in New Haven , East Haven , West Haven , Hamden , and parts of Milford and Orange .
All 15 towns were at risk of having brown water , but the problem tends to be worse in areas of high population density , she said .
“ It really has to do with people , ” she said .
“ It ’s so hot out .
People need water .
It ’s just a high demand .
There ’s really not a lot we can do . ”
Powell said in the past , customers have suffered brown water for a brief amount of time , when someone in the neighborhood opens a fire hydrant .
This year ’s problem is more severe , she said .
“ It has n’t happened to this degree probably for 15 years , ” Powell said .
The RWA outlined a couple of ways that people can assist : Restrict your lawn - watering to the early morning hours .
And be on the lookout for open fire hydrants : “ due to widespread illegal hydrant openings contributing to the high flows of water , please call your local fire department if you see an open hydrant . ”
The New Haven fire department can be reached during business hours at 203-946-6222 .
If RWA consumers have questions , they can call 203- 562-4020 .
Powell acknowledged the RWA was delayed in getting the word out to customers .
The utility posted the advice on its website at 10 a.m. Wednesday .
At that time , it also began sending out warnings to people who signed up for Code Red Alerts on the RWA website .
In lieu of an official announcement by the RWA Tuesday , comments ran fast and furious on SeeClick Fix .
A commenter named Daisy posted these two photos — one of a white bowl filled with tap water , the other of the sediment it left behind .
Others debated whether to bathe in the water .
“ My fiancee just took a shower and she did not die ! ” one commenter reported .
Another reported the muddy water had soiled a load of laundry .
“ Had to rewash our whites ! ” Kmherb wrote .
Meanwhile , water was flowing fast and furious at the intersection of Frank and West streets in the Hill Tuesday evening .
Neighborhood kids cooled off in the spray — and “ shared ” it with passing motorists , whether they wanted it or not .
An occasional driver got a pass , but that was the exception .

Yet no one has felt the need to comment on whether we can wash our dishes or shower in it …given that it leaves a visible residue , I ’d say not .
But I want an official word on what it is EXACTKY ( not some vague muttering about sediments ) , and whether it ’s dangerous ,

But is it safe to drink ?
Some people on seeclickfix reported that the water company says the problem stems from overwhelmed filtration systems .
If that is the case the brown water may not be safe to drink .
Clearly both the city and the water authority need to step up their crisis management and find ways to inform new haven citizens better .

This brown water needs to be acknowledged and explained to the public quickly by the Regional Water Authority .
We are afraid to bathe in it and certainly not planning on cooking with it .

The hydrant @ Frank & West was illegally opened ( no city sprinkler on it ) .
It is so dangerous espescially for the motorist who may not see a child running through the stream of water .
Also now the news is saying that the brown drinking water is related to all the fire hydrants that are continously being illegally opened again no so good .
Shame on the people who are doing this .

Thanks for going after the RWA to acknowledge what everyone has been noticing since early Tuesday .
NHI was a full 8 hours ahead of WTNH on the story !
Now how about investigating what appears to be rolling blackouts ?
Court , Academy and Olive went dark Tuesday night for the second night in a row .
East Rock neighborhoods report outages as well .
When will UI step up and acknowledge what ’s going on ?
How about some instructions to residents on how to conserve energy and still stay cool to avoid further blackouts ??

This is kind of pathetic .
Everyone puts all their eggs in one basket , so to speak , trusting a central authority of any kind and then decrying their lack of effectiveness in a crisis .
Everyone suddenly becomes helpless when they realize that very basic necessities , like water , are supplied and controlled by a central authority .
This scenario should shock and disgust us , but instead we use it as an opportunity to voice our opinions about what may have caused the crisis or who is to blame .
We miss the opportunity to make real changes in our lives to affect our fundamental needs .
We no sooner return to a cowering position before the state , pleading for their help , and the cycle continues .
With water being the most essential ingredient in our diets , we should know how to get it and filter it ourselves , if need be .
This story has proven once again how most modern humans are not fit to survive in their environment .
Most are being carried and propped up by the state or by a central authority of some kind , unable to account for their very basic needs such as water .
How sad .

Actually , I ’m surprised people say they have never seen this before ; it seems to happen every year .
Usually in the summer , when people are opening hydrants or the water company is repairing or maintaining the lines .
It ’s never been anything to worry about in the past , and a faucet filter clears it up if you ’re worried about drinking it .
I might hold off on washing your whites , though .

The RWA ’s excuse that the sediment is being stirred up because of the high demand on water due to the heat is a LIE !!!.
I live in East Rock and this problem occured several times over the winter months .
In the winter they told me that it was a crack in the water main and the dirt “ sediment ” was getting through .
Then it was a problem with the filtration system .
Now a totally different excuse for the same problem .
And they tell us to “ go buy bottled water ” .
So how about we all go buy this bottled water , and instead of sending money to pay our bills ( which we ’re still going to get ) we send in all the reciepts from the bottled water ( or filtration systems ) that we buy .

Its safe to drink the water .

Safe means we drop dead 10 years later .

Most know about this .
It has always been an issue since I was a kid .
It happens in the summer when kids open the hydrants and in community ’s after a fire .
Most city folks know about it ….
I guess not all .
I just find it funny that people are freaken out like it is the end of the world .
Again it happens every summer since I was a kid , and I am no spring chicken .
posted by : Cedarhillresident on July 7 , 2010 10:05 am oh and PS if the Hydrants where maintained the way they should be this would not happen I remember they use to go and drain them every year to prevent the heaviest of build up which maybe why it it is getting worse

Not true , FD inspects hydrants twice a year .
And if a hydrant is used in the winter it is immediately pumped out and inspected the next day .

I think I have a completely different perspective on basic utilities .
I ’m from the eastern end of Puerto Rico and the water or electric would go away often .
During heavy rain our water would turn brown — sometimes they ’d have to shut it off .
Trust me , it ’s better to have brown water running through your pipes than having to not flush your toilet for a few days — because I sure do n’t have the 50 gallon tank of back - up water that we used to have in PR — yup , to fill buckets up to flush the toilet and to warm up to bathe .
We have it exceptionally good up here — we rarely have interruptions of service .
The power going away ?
Standard at least once a month in PR .
I promise it ’s not the end of the world .

I do n’t know what the water company may have said in the winter months , but sometimes the same recurring problem can have different causes , as Cedarhillresident pointed out .
And if not every year , Milt , at least many years .
Also , I was actually looking for a way to avoid advertising a commercial product but what I meant by ‘ faucet filter ’ was something like a Brita or a Pur filter .
I have one on my kitchen faucet and it took the sediment out just fine .

If you do not know how to filter and purify your own water you should learn this invaluable skill asap .
I agree as well that RWA and such should do a bit better with keeping folks updated on water quality issues that may crop up - but the ‘ crisis ’ earlier this year in Boston with water quality shows that most people are too reliant on an outside authority for even the most basic of human needs .
Imagine what the case would be were this not sediment , or if nothing came out of your faucet when you turned it on ?
What if you could n’t go to the store and buy bottled water , or a water filter ?
If you do n’t know the answer to these questions , you should think about spending the 15 minutes that it would take to rectify this sickening lack .

posted by : visitor on July 7 , 2010 11:55 am most water authorities clean out the pipes regularly so that this sediment does n’t build up , no ?
and with how ridiculously high our water bills are , i would expect more than this .

What a range of reactions …
Interestingly enough , I ’m * not* seeing this problem even though my upstairs neighbors are .
Water looks fine to me .
True that in this modern industrialized world , we depend a lot on centralized services .
It ’s their job to get things right , but it ’s our job to hold them accountable for doing so .
I ’m glad they ’re testing the water — if the sediments really are as innocuous as they say , the situation does n’t seem all that bad to me ( inconvenience , yes , but a minor one ) .
But science should have the final say .

Ok - here is a basic system that is more so for filtration than some kind of microorganism purification , for which a bit of boiling , silver , or iodine can work .
http://pottersforpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/ide-filter-user-guide.pdf
I used a modified version this filtration system when I was in the back - country of Assateague island , which had plenty of water and sand , but cloudy water .
I made it from found materials and sand , but i would guess that most folks have something that would work similarly laying around .
I also do n’t think there is any problem with buying a filtration system from the store , etc. especially as a precaution , it is a pretty good idea !
However , simple systems like that one above , or involving sand / gravel and gravity are not difficult to make , and could save your life in a dangerous situation .
Also , I do n’t disagree that water bills are high , and that RWA should probably work to improve the quality of their website / sediment cleaning with this $ $ - but in the event of a major water - based catastrophe , putting all trust in the RWA because you pay high water bills is probably going to bode poorly for you .
As is complaining .

posted by : Water Scientist on July 7 , 2010 7:47 pm RWA are being partly truthful but deceitful .
The water is safe to drink because it has been treated , and the very fine particles in it have also been treated .
This includes filtration and chemical dosing including a degree of chlorination .
There are negligible toxins or bacteria in it .
What the RWA is not saying is the very fine particles , or sediment , are so small they are absorbed by the stomach lining and interfere with food digestion .
They are ejected by the body but the result can be serious diarrhea or dysentery .
So drink the water at your own risk .
For washing its okay , as the sediment cannot be absorbed through the skin .
My advice is buy bottled water till the water runs clean and has a slight chlorine like smell .
If your neighbor or someone else in the same building has a problem , then you have it too , even though your water may look clean .

That ’s a great deal more than the vast majority of people in the world have .
So as you filter , or boil , or buy bottles , or go through whatever tiresome process you have to go through to reassure yourself that you are not going to die from drinking this water , keep in mind the people worldwide who have to drink water they know is making them ill , who have to walk miles to fetch that water , every day of the year .

Ami , my point was not that it ’s ok to accept third world standards in a city such as New Haven .
As I explained , even this brown water is of a much higher standard than most people in the world have to accept .

There is one other news story about a town in New York ’s lower Hudson valley , and one about a town in Texas that had this problem last May .
Otherwise , it just seems to be us .
Why does this problem occur in just a few isolated towns ?
I generally believe that the water is usable .. but I also think this should n’t happen at all .
posted by : Brian on July 8 , 2010 1:50 pm
Looks like the discolored “ brown ” water is due to the resuspension of manganese sediments in the water distribution system from high demand flows .
This is a fairly common problem that is nearly unavoidable in extreme situations such as with this heat wave .
I would not drink the water and it can stain laundry .
Your best bet is to wait until the evening hours when system demands drop and the water clears .

The air we breathe on a regular basis in New Haven is far more disgusting and unhealthy than this brownish water coming out of the tap — it ’s just that you ca n’t see the ozone , SOx , NOx , and particulate matter as easily as you can see sediment residue in your water .
But nobody seems to complain very much about the air quality except a few activist groups that nobody pays much attention to .

The ARRA was -- I thought -- supposed to be only one of three big stimulative policy moves that was going to be undertaken in 2009 .
The ARRA , use of the TARP money to fund a very large risky asset purchase program by the Treasury , and quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve in order to restor confidence that there was no chance of deflation .
Only the first of these happened at any scale .
And we were unlucky .

Books , Bookstores and Libraries That Are Out to Get You
Do you know that there is a certain sub - genre ( sub - sub - genre ? ) of murder mysteries concerned with the world of authors , manuscripts , rare and deadly books - with the emphasis on deadly books ?.
Typically , they feature an indefatigable hero leaping around libraries in a race against time , unearthing cyphers , ancient manuscripts and clues hidden in old books .
Thrillers like this belong to a popular sub - genre called bibliomysteries , and as the name suggests , they all concern some sort of bookish skull - duggery .
Book lovers love them but if you ’re tempted to read one here are a few words of warning .
Books can be fatal , as this eager reader is about to discover :
The Book With The Iron Clasps ( left ) , The Book of Death on the right
This deadly tome is called ‘ The Book with The Iron Clasps ’ and its story lies in the novel of the same name .
Written by Angus B. Reach in 1848 , it ’s the first - ever detective novel (! ) and it ’s illustrated by George Cruikshank .
It may well be a cracking read but do n’t try to open it – the Borgias have poisoned the pages .
It ’s just the first of many books best kept under lock and key ...
The bad news is that some books have plain it got it in for you and in fact there are thousands of dangerous books lurking on the shelves .
Spotting them should be no trouble - there ’s no need to crack a code with a title like " The Book of Death " ...
Unfortunately as with all the best thrillers there ’s a twist to the tale – readers are not the only ones at risk .
Budding authors are told to ‘ write about what you know ’ but few of them realize just how dangerous writing can be .
Bibliomysteries have a habit of biting the hand that writes them :
Sometimes these hapless hacks are cut off mid-sentence long before getting the work to the publisher in the first place .
Manuscripts that threaten to expose the truth about the perils of the page are ruthlessly brought to a full stop :
By now even the bravest bibliophile will be glancing at their bookcase wondering if their next read might be their last .
Look out for those shelves , by the way – more than one bibliomystery starts with a body under a pile of books .
( Did they fall or were they pushed ? )
I ’d choose a short book next if I were you and even then you might not get to the last chapter to find out whodunnit :
Is nowhere safe ?
Surely the library can provide some sanctuary ?
Hah !
That , gentle reader , is just what they want you to think !
Libraries are full of books which makes them the deadliest places of all :
As for bookshops , well , there ’s nowhere better to spend a quiet five minutes but from now on it might be better to just cross over to the other side of the street .
Used bookstores are dying by the dozen but this is ridiculous :
Things are obviously worse than anyone suspected .
Let ’s play safe and just accept that books are best avoided :
Is nobody safe ?
It might be better to ask an expert .
What about that most – ahem - noble , upright , sainted individual , the book collector ?
Oh well .
Maybe it ’s better to just wait for the film to come out .
And look on the bright side - you probably wo n’t be able to get your hands on any of these bibliomysteries in the first place .
Look what happened to the guy I got them from :
I write about old books for the UK ’s leading book collecting magazine , Book and Magazine Collector , under the byline ‘ betweenthelines ’ .
I ’ve collected bibliomysteries for the last ten years .
Apart from the first the ones above date from 1904 to 1959 and are a mixture of American and British titles and editions .
Collecting mystery stories by theme is fun and relatively inexpensive and I ’ll write more about this soon .
In the meantime you can read about plenty of other interesting old books on my website , www.anewlookatoldbooks.com.
Please join me each Sunday evening for the book of the week .
Be careful while outside some sinister bookshops , too ...
Even if you escape the clutches of " fatal " books , you can still fall victim to a store 's drain pipe :

Are you feeling overwhelmed , stressed out , and ca n’t focus ?
Then maybe you do have ADHD .
But , in our experience , finding reliable , independent information on adult ADD / ADHD is difficult .
Especially online .
Everyone has a strong opinion on what ADHD is and whether it ’s even a real ‘ disorder . ’
The amount of ‘ Myth - Information ’ is overwhelming and often disheartening .
ADHD is a real disorder and doctors have been diagnosing what we now know is ADHD since the 1700’s .
Today , there are thousands of studies and new Brain Imaging Technologies that show there is a real difference in how the ADHD brain works .
In fact , genetic researchers have identified over 20 genes associated with this mindset .
You should know however that ADHD is neither a moral failing nor a character flaw–it ’s an issue with low levels of certain brain chemicals .
About 4 % of adults qualify as having ADHD , but most ADD adults have no idea they have it .
What will I learn from the quiz ?
This 5 minute quiz will :
Suggest whether ADHD may be an issue for you .
Reveal which of the two main subtypes of ADHD you fit into .
Help you learn more about ADHD and your next steps .
This quiz is based on the international standards for diagnosing ADHD / ADD adults , set forth by the World Health Organization , The American Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Psychiatric Association .
What makes ADHD an actual disorder ?
Because it may be undermining your best efforts to enjoy and participate in many areas of your life .
Understand what it is , and how it affects adults is the key to taking the next steps on what to do about it .
Image caption Is Nili Fossae the site where life on ancient Mars was buried and preserved ?
Researchers have identified rocks that they say could contain the fossilised remains of life on early Mars .
The team made their discovery in the ancient rocks of Nili Fossae .
Their work has revealed that this trench on Mars is a " dead ringer " for a region in Australia where some of the earliest evidence of life on Earth has been buried and preserved in mineral form .
They report the findings in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters .
The team , led by a scientist from the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute ( Seti ) in California , believes that the same " hydrothermal " processes that preserved these markers of life on Earth could have taken place on Mars at Nili Fossae .
The rocks there are up to four billion years old , which means they have been around for three - quarters of the history of Mars .
When , in 2008 , scientists first discovered carbonate in those rocks the Mars science community reacted with great excitement ; carbonate had long been sought as definitive evidence that the Red planet was habitable - that life could have existed there .
This is the place that we should be checking out for life on early Mars Adrian Brown , Seti Institute
Carbonate is what life - or at least the mineral portion of a living organism - turns into , in many cases , when it is buried .
The white cliffs of Dover , for example , are white because they contain limestone , or calcium carbonate .
The mineral comes from the fossilised remains shells and bones and provides a way to investigate the ancient life that existed on early Earth .
In this new research , scientists have taken the identification of carbonate on Mars a step further .
Adrian Brown from the Seti Institute , who led the research , used an instrument aboard Nasa 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter called Crism to study the Nilae Fossae rocks with infrared light .
Then he and his team used exactly the same technique to study rocks in an area in north - west Australia called the Pilbara .
" The Pilbara is very cool , " Dr Brown told BBC News .
" It 's part of the Earth that has managed to stay at the surface for around 3.5 billion years - so about three quarters of the history of the Earth . "
" It allows us a little window into what was happening on the Earth at its very early stages . "
Image caption Scientists believe life could have existed on Mars almost four billion years ago
And all those billions of years ago , scientists believe that microbes formed some distinctive features in the Pilbara rocks - features called " stromatolites " that can be seen and studied today .
" Life made these features .
We can tell that by the fact that only life could make those shapes ; no geological process could . "
This latest study has revealed that the rocks at Nili Fossae are very similar to the Pilbara rocks - in terms of the minerals they contain .
And Dr Brown and his colleagues believe that this shows that the remnants of life on early Mars could be buried at this site .
" If there was enough life to make layers , to make corals or some sort of microbial homes , and if it was buried on Mars , the same physics that took place on Earth could have happened there , " he said .
That , he suggests , is why the two sites are such a close match .
' Geological olympics '
Dr Brown and many other scientists had hoped that they would soon have the opportunity to get much closer to these rocks .
Nili Fossae was put forward as a potential landing site for Nasa 'a ambitious new rover , the Mars Science Laboratory , which will be launched in 2011 .
The site was championed by other geologists , including John Mustard from Brown University in Rhode Island , whose team made the case to Nasa to have it included in the landing site shortlist for MSL .
But Nilae Fossae was eventually deemed too dangerous a landing site and it was finally removed from the list in June of this year .
Image caption
The shortlist of four landing sites ( labelled in white ) and the position landers and rovers already on Mars ( in yellow )
" The rover is being landed remotely - so there 's no human pilot involved ; it 's all up to the robot .
And [ that 's ] a very dangerous thing , " said Dr Brown .
" You need 20 km of smooth terrain and unfortunately at this site it is pretty rocky - those ancient rocks are pretty weathered and the surface is rocky and uneven . "
" It will be visiting another interesting site when it lands , but this is the place that we should be checking out for life on early Mars . "
John Grant , a scientist from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC , and a member of the planetary sciences panel that advises Nasa on the MSL mission , spoke to BBC News earlier this year about the choice of landing site .
He said that the objective of mission was a search for " habitability " .
It was not , he said , a life detection mission .
" [ It ] entails looking at geologic environments that may not only have been habitable but where signals associated with that habitability have been preserved , " he told BBC News in February .
But that does not alleviate the disappointment that many feel over having Nili Fossae and all its secrets taken off the table for the mission .
And what makes Mars Science Laboratory even more of a crucial mission for scientists is the fact that it will be the last rover to explore the surface of Mars until 2018 - partly because funding the mission has been so extraordinarily expensive .
Dr Brown described the experience of having his favoured landing site removed from the shortlist as the geological equivalent of having " your city 's Olympic bid rejected " .
" I also see a race happening here , " he said .
" It might take us a couple of decades to build our capability to land [ unmanned ] rovers somewhere geologically interesting on Mars .
" And in those decades , human space flight capabilities are going to develop and we could have the capability to send humans to Mars . "
So in this race of the human versus the robots , which will win ?
" It 's my personal belief , " said Dr Brown , " that by the time real human geologists get to go to Mars , the question of whether there is life on Mars will still be open . "

The Jenolan Caves near the Blue Mountains west of Sydney is about to become possibly the first tourist attraction in the world to launch tours in the fictional Star Trek language of Klingon .
The link between the world 's oldest dated limestone cave system and the fictional Star Trek language is through a spaceship , the USS Jenolan , which featured in an episode of the Next Generation series .
Earlier this month two Klingon scholars from the United States flew to Australia to tour the caves and finalise the translation of a self - guided tour .
They have recorded it at a Sydney studio and the commentary will be available late next month on a digital audio device .

Over a week ago , Geekosystem reported on how nine domains , including the much adored Ninjavideo and TVShack , were controversially taken down by U.S. authorities at the behest of Disney in the cleverly named “ Operation In Our Sites , ” citing intellectual property theft .
Now we ’ve learned that an apparently reliable source told TorrentFreak that the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) –the non-profit , private corporation responsible for managing the web ’s domain name system–had in fact handed over the movie streaming domains to the government , as the domain owners were violating their terms and conditions , in part by blocking their WHOIS information .
What ’s more , TorrentFreak is reporting that two more sites had been targeted by Homeland Security officials : download giants Pirate Bay and MegaUpload were on the suggested list for domain seizure .
P2P technology expert Johan Pouwelse from the Delft University of Technology remarked : “ Hollywood lawyers have discovered the soft underbelly of piracy . ”
In the case of Pirate Bay , U.S. authorities perhaps decided timing was n’t convenient , due to the pending criminal process against the site in Swedish court .
Additionally , whereas various other sites targeted had made their Whois data anonymous , TPB ’s information is valid .
In any case , Pirate Bay is dealing with its own worries at the moment , patching gaps following a massive security breach yesterday .
Whether the Hong Kong - based MegaUpload is under any threat of seizure is uncertain .
To MU ’s credit , they are normally adept at identifying and taking down pirated files that have been uploaded .
Internet users have questioned the diplomatic and legal issues of targeting private websites with servers located off American shores .
One poster , wtfgov ? , writes : “ whether or not these websites follow american copyright laws , the constitution does not grant mr. obama the privillege to seize private property from other countries … ”
When pressed for comment , ICANN did not offer Torrent Freak a reply .

A flotilla of nine spud barges – flanked by containment boom – will be waiting , ready to block the 530 - foot - wide entrance to Weeks Bay .
If all goes according to plan , these rusted steel behemoths will form an impenetrable barrier , defending the estuary ’s 19 federally - protected species and the vital marshland which serves as a nursery for shrimp and other seafood so crucial to the Gulf Coast region .
They will also preserve an unspoiled way of life .
The blockade is being led by Jamie Hinton , the local volunteer fire chief who , at one point , was faced with the possibility of being jailed for violating the federal and state chain of command .
His resourcefulness is a parable not only of how desperate Gulf Coast communities have become to save the shorelines on which their lives have taken root , but also of the confusion that can consume and undermine such a massive relief effort .
In the end , Magnolia Springs did not need BP or Mr. Obama or the governor in Montgomery .
It needed the grit and determination of the people themselves – people like Hinton , who says he will stand chest - deep in the waters of the bay , linked arm in arm with his neighbors , if that ’s what it takes to stop the encroaching oil from despoiling the sublime latticework of bogs and bayous that he calls home .
Hinton 's plan
Soft - spoken and polite , Mr. Hinton does n’t fit the image of a rabble - rouser , but still waters run deep .
He is passionate about this wildly beautiful place .
The plan he has been charged with implementing was the product of exhaustive community input .
It is an attempt to defeat those forces of nature that have often defeated the Coast Guard and BP elsewhere .
Boom is effective when placed properly , but even in relatively calm waters , some oil will always go over and beneath it .
In Weeks Bay , where there is a constant one - to two - foot chop , booming is an extra challenge .
That ’s where Hinton ’s barges come in .
Hinton hopes they will break any wave action , allowing the boom laid in front of and behind them to hold the oil .
It ’s not a fail - safe plan , Hinton acknowledges .
He would know .
He has more than 400 hours of hazardous materials training , including booming instruction .
“ Ca n’t say [ the oil ] is going to make it through and ca n’t say it won’t , ” he says .
But at least it ’s a plan .
Nobody else seemed inclined to do much of anything for Magnolia Springs , he says .
When he first began gathering resources , county officials told him he was blowing things out of proportion , that it was just sweet crude .
“ I do n’t care if it ’s sweet , sour , light , or black , ” he says .
“ I do n’t want it in my river . ”
Others told him the government would handle it .
He scoffed .
He remembered the Exxon Valdez , hurricane Katrina , hurricane Ivan .
If anyone was going to save Magnolia Springs , it would n’t be the feds , BP , or environmental activists .
It would be the thousand - odd people who live here .
After all , the locals knew the water – knew every twist and turn of Magnolia River , Fish River , and Weeks Bay .
They would handle things the way they always did – together .
While the community struggled to get its plan approved by Deepwater Horizon Unified Command , BP workers arrived with their own plan :
They laid a straight line of boom across the bay , tied it to pylons with rope , and left .
Hinton tried to tell them the pylons were encrusted with barnacles , but no one listened .
He knew the tossing waters would cause the sharp shells to sever the rope , and he was right .
The boom floated away , and Magnolia Springs was left defenseless once more .
Instead of being discouraged , he redoubled his efforts , and by mid-May , the town ’s plans had been approved , along with a $ 200,000 grant to keep the barges manned 24/7 – a Coast Guard requirement – for three weeks .
All that remained was the decision about when to put the plan into action .
Jumping through hoops
Last Wednesday , that moment came .
Hinton called the Alabama Department of Environmental Management and told them the time had come to deploy the
barges .
“ They acted as if they ’d never heard about it , ” he says .
“ We started jumping through hoops to get the plan approved again . ”
Hinton and Mayor Charles Houser conferred .
If the small - town fire chief blocked the bay without permission , he could be jailed or fined , but he was willing to take that chance .
In a way , the decision was an easy one .
There is a timelessness to the marshes of Magnolia Springs , where ospreys glide across the water and cottonmouths slither through pitcher plant bogs .
It is “ the most beautiful place on earth , ” Hinton says , and he wants his grandchildren to see it – just as it is now .
Friday afternoon , Hinton learned his plans had been approved once more , backed by another grant that should allow them to keep the barges in place for as long as three months if necessary .
“ We ’ve done all we can do , ” he says .
The uncertainty leads to sleepless nights for both Hinton and Mayor Houser , who says he ’s confident about their course of action but still feels a queasy tension .
He ’s frustrated by BP ’s overall plan for the Gulf Coast , calling it confusing and disjointed , with no clear chain of command .
“ I ’ve been in meetings with BP and they seem like they live in a vacuum , ” he said Friday as he stared out at the water .
“ They just do n’t get it .
How can you replace this ?
It ’s our little slice of heaven . ”

“ I ’ll swallow your soul ! ” ~ Possessed Henrietta ( Evil Dead II , 1987 )
Demons have long been the stuff of High Fantasy Fiction , long before Dungeons & Dragons began to cram them into a small corner of a Monster Manual , under the Letter D. From pulp fiction heroes like R.E. Howard ’s brawling Conan the Cimmerian , to Moorcock ’s tragic Elric of Melnibonea , to Lieber ’s swashbuckling duo Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser , fantasy authors have been conjuring demons to beset heroes since the 1930s .
And whether the protagonists are facing the horridly - tentacled Thog , or Arioch of the Seven Darks , or a foggy demon of pure Hate , the heroes are squaring off against some of the most horrid and dangerous monsters in all of fantasy literature .
For most Authors are quick to remind us that demons are not merely content with killing the body and eating it , but are also capable of devouring the heroes ’ very souls as well !
Over the years , and across the various D&D editions , demons have gone through a number of transformations .
Many remember the change of name to present a more “ politically correct ” game to the public , changing “ demon ” to “ tanar ’ri ” .
And there were even some cosmological changes as well , particularly during the advent of Planescape , when demons , devils , and daemons became embroiled in a brutal Blood War across the Lower Planes .
But now , with D&D 4E , the multiverse has changed once again , the Elemental Chaos and the Astral Sea have become re-defined in the cosmos , and even the Abyss has become something a bit stranger and darker than it was in previous editions .
And with those changes , the WotC developers have released a new book , the Demonomicon , based upon the arcane tome penned by the Witch Queen Iggwilv , and offering Dungeon Masters a new vision of rampaging demons for Characters of all Levels to face .
Demonomicon
Authors : Mike Mearls , Brian R. James , Steve Townsend
Cover Illustrator : John Stanko
Publisher : Wizards of the Coast
Year : 2010
Media : Hardbound ( 160 pages )
Retail Cost : $ 29.95 ( $ 19.77 from Amazon )
The Demonomicon ( of Iggwilv ) is an official sourcebook for use with Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition , containing new esoteric demon lore , a tour guide of notable Abyssal locations , and a monster manual of new demons to be used at all levels of play .
The sourcebook is campaign “ non- specific ” , presenting demons for use with the general cosmology described in the Manual of the Planes and the Dungeon Masters Guide .
The Production Quality of the Demonomicon is excellent , with some very fine writing by the Authors and other contributors , and the information presented in a logical fashion , which makes it easy to use by Dungeon Masters .
Admittedly , there are occasional references to other published works , such as Dragon Magazine or Manual of the Planes , but these are always noted with a page number to facilitate a look - up .
The new demons presented in the book use the new format of monster stat blocks , along with more descriptive monster lore sections accompanying the stats , as was recently introduced in the Monster Manual 3 .
And the artwork in the Demonomicon is frankly stunning , particularly in the latter portion of the sourcebook where the new demons are detailed .
But there are also some very fine maps rendered of the Abyssal locales as well in Chapter 2 , which should prove very useful for Dungeon Masters when their adventurers choose to plumb the deepest depths of evil .
The Demonomicon is divided simply into three broad Chapters – Demon Lore , The Abyss and Demons – with the latter essentially functioning as a Monster Manual Supplement of new Demons and Demon Lords .
The first two chapters are then divided up into sub-sections , each discussing different topics of Demon Lore , and the Layers of the Abyss , respectively , and the Authors present the information in a reasonably organized fashion .
Like the Monster Manuals , the final chapter presents new demons and demonic creatures alphabetically , although there is a table at the end which lists demons by Level to make them easy to add to encounters .
In the first Chapter on Demon Lore , the Authors present some rich background information on the formation of the Abyss : a terrifying plot designed to destroy this cosmos by evil beings from another universe , called the Obyriths .
I actually found the background information really fascinating , as it involved an old power from the Greyhawk Campaign setting , Tharizdun , as the progenitor of The Abyss in the Elemental Chaos , after he had been corrupted and mislead by the alien Obyriths .
Although the story of Tharizdun and the Cult of Elemental Evil has been edited somewhat from its original material to make it fit the new 4E cosmology , it is actually a nice homage to Gary Gygax ’s vision of a dark primal god of pure evil so terrible that the gods had to bind him in perpetual imprisonment to save all of creation .
And the addition of a new order of evil entities that corrupted Tharizdun , which seeded the Abyss in the first place with Tharizdun ’s help , is just begging for development into a campaign arc .
And the Authors of Demonomicon do just that by giving Dungeon Masters an example of one called “ Rise of the Obyriths ” .
Although it is just a “ bare bones ” outline , the Demonomicon envisions a fairly epic campaign arc , starting with squabbles between demon cultists in the Heroic Teir , and ending in the Epic Tier with a mass charge into the Abyss at the head of an army of allied forces from all over the astral plane in order to stop the Obyriths from remaking cosmos in their own demented and evil image .
Definitely enough material there to keep adventurers busy for 30 Levels – and it is , of course , only one possibility for a campaign against these evil alien entities !
It is actually somewhat hard to convey just how much really great “ fluff ” and adventure hooks are packed into the first chapter of this sourcebook .
But Chapter 1 of the Demonomicon has quite a bit of decent “ crunch ” in it as well , as the excerpt on Cacodemon Possession as was previewed in June on the WotC site can attest .
Of course , there is a lot more to the discussion on Cacodemons , and to demonic possession in general , which DMs can use to spin - off some amazing adventures .
Now as a Dungeon Master , I am a huge fan of Monster Themes , as I recently revealed with my own Bloodtainted Theme a couple weeks ago .
I am pleased to find that the Authors of Demonomicon created really awesome new Themes to use to create the followers of the various demon lords , such as Yeenoghu ’s Death Pack , Kostchtchie ’s Winter Host , and my personal favorite , the Faithful of Graz ’zt .
There is also a brilliant
Theme designed for pairing a demon and a mortal summoner in an encounter – Demon Summoners and Bound Fiends – which gives each of them powers that are specifically used to act more synergistically during an encounter .
And yes , there is a listing for the Summon Demon Ritual for Ritual Casters , should they be so inclined ( or insane ) to want to try bargaining with a demon for help !
Admittedly , I was ambivalent about the “ Theme ” which allows a DM to substitute a different encounter power for a demon ’s variable resistance ability .
While an interesting concept , it is not really a “ theme ” , but more a way to play to the weakness of a group of Heroes for not having enough elemental attack powers to make the variable resistance worth having .
However , I did think these new demonic powers were pretty darned nice , but it feels a little too contrived to edit monsters just to oppose a party ’s weak suits .
It is definitely one of those stat block edits that Dungeon Masters should be careful about using too often .
Chapter 1 ends with some very “ crunchy ” demonic - related hazards to spice up an encounter .
Many of the hazards take the form of furnishings and architecture , such as pillars , altars , and tapestries .
This provides Characters a very good reason to be little more concerned about the décor than just viewing everything a DM describes in an encounter setting as mere flavor text .
Chapter 2 deals with the nature of various layers of the Abyss , detailing their rulers , ecology , inhabitants , and hazards .
There is a very nice Table of Abyssal Layers in the middle of this chapter , offering Dungeon Masters a quick reference of over 80 listings , of which nearly a score of these locales are discussed in the Demonomicon .
The table also denotes the name of the demon lord which rules that layer , and the page number to reference either the Demonomicon , or Manual of the Planes or a particular Dragon Magazine ( usually from the column from which this sourcebook gets its name ) .
It is worth mentioning that there are listings for demon lords and Abyssal layers which have not been developed by the Wizards of the Coast design team in this or any other sourcebook .
No hint is given if these will be developed later in future Dragon Magazine columns , or are just offered to spur the creativity of Dungeon Masters , with fascinating names like the demon lord Socothbenoth ’s layer called Goranthis or Azazel ’s layer called the Outcast ’s End .
Regardless , there are some tantalizing locales provided for Heroes to seek high adventure .
Of the Abyssal layers discussed in the Demonomicon , some of them are given considerably more detailed descriptions than others .
For instance , the Plane of a Thousand Portals , the realm of demon lord Pazuzu , and the triple - layered realm of the demon lord Graz ’zt , called Azzagrat , are given some incredible details , discussing not only the nature of the Abyssal realm , but also specific geographical locales and noteworthy terrain .
These areas can be quickly developed for use in a campaign with a little or no work , and would provide heroes a good stomping ground for their adventures in the Abyss .
Other well developed locations from the Demonomicon include The Blood Rift and the City of Morglon - Daar , the Iron Wastes of Kostchtchie , Demogorgon ’s Abysm , and Oublivae ’s realm , called simply The Barrens .
Obviously , in a book which is only 160 pages long , not every layer of the Abyss can be listed in such expansive details as the previously mentioned locales .
The Authors make note of nine other realms of interest , and give them a quick 2 - 3 paragraphs , as well as a table of the layer ’s traits .
Disappointingly , Zuggtmoy ’s realm of Shedaklah is one of those having a short entry , which is surprising as the demon lord of fungus makes her grand re-emergence to 4th Edition later in Chapter 3 .
Those old - school AD&D gamers will undoubtedly remember this nasty demoness from the Temple of Elemental Evil adventure , the sequel to the Village of Hommelet module .
But perhaps even more noticeable an omission is the listing for the infamous demon lord Jubilex .
Perhaps one of the most well - known demon lords from the early days of Dungeons & Dragons , second only perhaps to Orcus , it seems a clear case of oversight to include his rival Zuggtmoy , but to omit a stat block for Jubilex – particularly in light of the fact that his realm , Molor , was discussed in The Plane Below , yet he was not given stats in that sourcebook either !
However , despite the omissions , Chapter 2 of the Demonomicon is a well - designed primer to the Abyss , capable of giving Dungeon Masters a good starting point to begin planning their own campaigns there .
It should be noted that the Authors also provide some very interesting material regarding a variety of ways to travel through the Abyss using all manner of portals and gates , as well as a bit on nature of demonic cults and temples .
Strangely , the latter section would probably have been a better fit in Chapter 1 : Demon Lore , rather than Chapter 2 : The Abyss .
The final section of Chapter 2 features two Demonic Delves , with detailed adventure locales , hooks , and a couple of encounters designed specifically for each delve .
The first delve which is designed for the end of the Paragon Tier , entitled The Wasting Tower , is of particular note as it features a trip into the Abyssal realm of The Blood Rift , to the Tower of Khin Oin .
Planscape fans will enjoy the fact that the famous power broker of Sigil , Schemeshka the Marauder , plays a big part in this short adventure , which makes this Demonic Delve a noteworthy experience .
The last Chapter of the Demonomicon , which is the largest section of the book , is a monster manual of new demons and demon lords .
The authors have created the stat blocks for five demon lords and nearly sixty other demons ranging in power to be capable of use in all three Tiers of play .
One of the new demon lords introduced , Oublivae , was discussed in the Spotlight Interview – 3 Questions : Oublivae and from her stat block , she does a good job living up to the “ hype ” offered by the designer , Steve Towsend .
The other demon lords included in the Demonomicon include Kostchtchie , Pazuzu , Zuggtmoy , and Phraxas , several of which have appeared in previous editions .
And although Phraxas seems to be a new demon lord , he actually bears a certain resemblance to Anthraxas the Oinodaemon , a daemon lord from AD&D .
In fact , many of the previous editions “ daemons ” or “ yugoloths ” have been inducted into the Abyss as demons now , including the guardian demon , derghodemon , piscodemon , yagnodemon , hydrodemon , and a new minion form of the mezzodemon .
But the slide of daemons to demons started long before the Demonomicon , and this sourcebook merely presents a wide variety of demonic creatures which can ravage the cosmos in almost any environment .
I was very pleased to see the authors include the Nabassu demon , which was one nasty piece of work in the old editions , and is just as mean and nasty in 4E .
The Authors also looked beyond the “ classic ” AD&D demons and daemons to draw inspiration from , and included a host of demonic entities like the abyssal ravager , the blood demon ( previously blood fiend ) , and the zovvut .
There were , however , some critters which made the leap from just plain old monster to demon that were a bit surprising .
The ixitachitl is no longer a strange form of intelligent sting ray with an Aztec-ish name , but are now demonic servants of Demogorgon , created when he was an aquatic primordial before his transformation to demon lord .
And clockwork horrors have graduated from mere constructs to elemental demonic constructs created by a demon lord of Alchemy and Artifice named Haagenti .
I cannot say that I am opposed to these changes from the original monsters , just more surprised they would be taken in such a drastically different direction than their original AD&D concepts .
Overall Grade : A-
With very little reservation , I can definitely recommend the Demonomicon as a truly excellent sourcebook , and is fighting hard for the top spot in my library against the previously release Underdark earlier this year .
Much like Underdark , it is narrowly focused onto an iconic portion of the D&D universe , and offers rich and well - developed content which will provide the foundation for numerous campaign arcs and adventures for many Dungeon Masters everywhere .
And unlike Manual of the Planes , The Plane Below and The Plan Above , the Demonomicon does not try to take on so much material that it cannot adequately develop it within a moderately sized sourcebook , but because of its focus , manages to provide a very satisfying blend of “ fluff ” and “ crunch ” regarding all thing demonic .
Now I am not saying that I would not have preferred to see more than just a 160 page sourcebook , but for its page length , Demonomicon definitely packs in a lot of material .
Sadly , the MSRP for Demonomicon is its most disappointing feature , and I have already voiced my concern about page length shrinkage versus retail price in previous blogs .
But given the potential demonic mayhem that can be loosed on a campaign from this sourcebook , owning a copy of the Demonomicon of Iggwilv should be high on the priority list of every Dungeon Master who wants to show their adventurers the depths of pure evil .
So until next blog … I wish you Happy Gaming !

Calvin Tillman , the mayor of DISH , Texas — the tiny hamlet named for the network that gives its residents free satellite TV — sits in his City Hall office , matter - of - factly telling a documentary filmmaker about how somebody ’s going to accidently “ blow up the town ” someday .
The roughly 200 residents of DISH live atop the natural - gas - rich Barnett Shale in Denton County .
And so Josh Fox , the director of HBO ’s Gasland — which chronicles the dangers of natural gas drilling and related air and groundwater contamination — has come to hear Tillman 's woes .
“ It ’s humorous — but it ’s not humorous , ” Tillman warns before describing one of the local natural gas compressor sites in DISH for the cameras .
“ There ’s a sign that says no open flames , no smoking — and there ’s a barbecue grill sitting underneath it .
So , some guy is going to be cooking his hamburger one day and blow up the town . ”
Fox ’s documentary , complete with that scene , premiered on June 21 to the consternation of oil and gas producers .
The tone used to describe DISH marks a stark change from the one struck the first time the town was featured on cable .
The jokes were better then .
In a Jan. 10 , 2006 segment on Comedy Central ’s The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , correspondent Ed Helms chronicles the bickering between and former mayor Landis Clark — who founded the town in 2000 — and then - mayor Bill Merritt over the decision to change the name from Clark ( as in Landis Clark ) to DISH .
The goings - on in DISH are n’t funny anymore .
Lately , Tillman , who became mayor in 2007 , has been fighting for the town ’s survival as natural gas companies have laid miles of pipeline through residents ’ property and constructed multiple compressor sites .
Air quality has consumed much of Tillman ’s focus , though residents also complain of noise from the facilities , of having their property turned over to private companies against their will and most recently of contamination in their drinking water .
As he takes on the companies and the agencies that regulate them , Tillman has become a media darling , an unlikely face of oil and gas reform and a public speaker crisscrossing the country .
But now , he ’s ready to give up — packing up and preparing to leave the town entirely , along with his job as mayor .
That ’s if he can sell his house promptly , which will be difficult in a town where property values have plummeted .
" It 's been one of those things , you know , we knew it was bad , but we just kept hoping it would get better , " says Tillman , who is no longer confident enough in that hope to subject his kids to life in the shadows of natural gas facilities .
In his three years as mayor , Tillman ’s chief focus has been on reducing the chemicals released into the air by the compressor sites , which did n’t exist when he moved to DISH in 2003 .
Recently he has been forced to also cast his attention to what ’s been happening underneath his feet .
This spring , less than a mile from his house , Amber and Damon Smith began finding sediment and fluids in their tap water that they suspect are associated with the hydraulic fracturing — or “ fracking ” — process used to free the natural gas from the shale below .
Currently , the Smiths , who also have young children , are the only DISH residents complaining of a water problem , but given time , neighbors fully expect it to spread .
Besides the promise of free satellite television until 2015 , the community of DISH is united by a mix of health concerns , declining property values and a palpable distrust of government .
“ We ’re mostly a good group of hardworking , honest folks , " says Tillman of the mostly conservative town .
“ We ’re not a group of radical tree - huggers .
We ’re hardworking , tax - paying honest American Texans , and we ’ve been wronged . ”
Energy in Depth , a coalition of natural gas producers , released a rebuttal to Fox ’s “ shock - u- mentary ” featuring DISH .
The group adamantly asserts that fracking does not contaminate drinking water .
They include a May 2009 quote from outgoing Texas Railroad Commissioner Victor Carillo : “ Though hydraulic fracturing has been used for over 50 years in Texas , our records do not indicate a single documented contamination case associated with hydraulic fracturing . ”
Tillman acknowledges that some positive strides have been made .
In terms of aesthetics , noise level , odor and environmental impact , Tillman says DISH is now among the most livable of comparable locations in the Barnett Shale region .
It has n’t always been that way .
“ The companies have really cleaned up their act , ” he says , though he credits the pressure of public opinion — not the force of regulatory agencies , which he charges have " rolled over " to big corporations .
Frustrated with slow - moving state agencies , Tillman convinced the town of DISH to fork over a significant chunk of its city budget to commission its own air quality study .
Released in September 2009 , the study concluded : “ Air analysis performed in the Town of DISH confirmed the presence in high concentrations of carcinogenic and neurotoxin compounds in ambient air near and / or on residential properties .
The compounds in the air indicate quantities in excess of what would normally be anticipated in ambient air in an urban residential or rural residential area . ”
In April of this year , the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality installed a permanent air monitor in DISH .
In its first two months of operation , it has yet to measure any significant cause for concern .
Occasionally , some of compounds will show a spike , often in conjuncture with an odor that Tillman describes as “ like a sulfur smell . ”
He suspects it 's exacerbated by glycol dehydrators that were installed about two years ago to remove moisture from the gas .
This spring , Tillman ’s son began getting nosebleeds on nights when the smell hung in the air , which prompted the family 's decision to leave .
“ It is possible that something that is not tested for is causing the nosebleeds , or maybe this is just coincidence , but it disturbs me nonetheless , ” he wrote on his blog ( unsubtly titled baddish.blogspot.com ) when he announced his decision .
Tillman offers formaldehyde as an example of something that might be affecting his boys that TCEQ does not test for .
“ They are so far behind the curve on this , I ’m not sure they know what to test for and how to do it , ” he says .
“ I suggest something and they look at me like I ’ve got two heads . ”
He suspects that when he goes , the air pollution monitor will follow shortly thereafter .
“ I think it will maintain for a while , ” he says .
“ Someone will come in behind me that will keep the pressure moving , but eventually it will go back to what it was . ”
TCEQ spokeswoman Lisa Wheeler said Tuesday that the agency could not immediately comment for this story .
( See their response , filed after this story originally ran , here . )
Upon request from the town , the Department of State Health Services agreed to test exposure levels in DISH residents earlier this year .
It concluded that while some individuals had higher levels of known toxins , like benzene , those tested did not demonstrate a pattern consistent with a community - wide exposure to a single source , but were likely due to factors such as smoking or car exhaust .
Jim Caplinger was one of the residents tested .
He “ absolutely ” did not believe the DSHS conclusion .
“ Even though all the things in my blood were given off by the compressor station , ” he says , “ the one thing they would not attribute it to was the compressor station . ”
DSHS spokeswoman Christine DeLoma says the purpose of the study was only to determine exposure levels , not to identify a source of exposure .
“ As with any study , there are limitations , and we acknowledge that , ” she says , noting that the measurement was only a onetime test of recent exposures — effectively a snapshot in time .
DeLoma says DSHS remains open to conducting another study , but the town has yet to request one .
Tillman calls the DSHS report an “ obvious political statement . ”
Aware that his detractors criticize such a response as indicative of an inability to accept any conclusion but his own , he says , “ Frankly , the answer I wanted was that they had n’t found anything , but they found some things .
...
And based on my experience with other state agencies , I do firmly believe that they are here to protect the industry . ”
DISH residents Jim and Judy Caplingers are planning to leave town like the mayor and soon will put their house on the market , they say .
They moved in at the beginning of 2005 .
“ It was beautiful and peaceful when we first moved out there , ” Judy says , “ but it did not last long . ”
They ’ve noticed the same smell Tillman has , but mostly they hate the noise from the compressor station — “ like a 747 trying to take off , ” Judy says .
Resident Chuck Paul ’s property has been on and off the market over the last two years .
In that time , pipeline companies have claimed portions of his land for the and installed pipe underneath it , so that he says only about 30 of his 64 acres are usable .
“ With the way they cut it up , you ca n’t do anything with the property except pay the taxes and grow grass on it , ” he says .
When he tried to auction it off , he was offered about 50 cents on the dollar and turned it down .
Of course , Tillman ’s high - profile advocacy does n’t exactly foster a seller ’s market .
“ Naturally , I think it ’s more important that word gets out , ” he says .
Both the Tillmans and the Caplingers expect to incur significant losses when — if — they sell their houses .
Tillman can’t imagine letting go completely — he expects to stay involved moving forward , even if from a distance .
He acknowledges that his notoriety will likely wane if he relinquishes his role as a public official .
“ Walking away is going to be difficult , ” he says .
“ These are my friends and extended family here .
One of the things that really frustrates me about the situation is that this is my home . ”
He says he ’ll miss the free Dish Network and does n’t know where his next home might be , but “ it will be away from the Barnett Shale . ”
Filmmaker James Cameron speaks at The Climate Rally concert in honor of the 40th Anniversary of Earth Day , in Washington on April 25 , 2010 .

MOSCOW , June 4 ( UPI ) -- U.S. authorities would be " appalled " if the Russian mini-submarine Mir were dispatched to help control the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , Russian officials said .
U.S. filmmaker James Cameron said Russian - made
Mir submarines could help BP with its efforts to control oil spilling from a well a mile underwater in the Gulf of Mexico .

Cameron used the Mir during filming of the 1997 blockbuster Titanic .
Anatoly Sagalevich , a director at the Russian Shirshov Institute of Oceanology , said he spoke with Cameron on dispatching the submersible to the Gulf of Mexico , Russian 's state - run news agency RIA Novosti reports .
The Shirshov Institute owns the Mir mini-subs .
Cameron raised the issue of deploying Mirs during meetings with U.S. regulators Wednesday .
Sagalevich said executives at BP rejected the proposal , the Russian news agency noted .
" We are Russians and if we go to the Gulf of Mexico with Mirs and do something there , the Americans would be appalled , " he explained .
British , American and Norwegian engineers are in a race to design and build the holy grail of wind turbines – giant , 10 MW offshore machines twice the size and power of anything seen before – that could transform the global energy market because of their economies of scale .
Today , a revolutionary British design that mimics a spinning sycamore leaf and which was inspired by floating oil platform technology , entered the race .
Leading engineering firm Arup is to work with an academic consortium backed by blue - chip companies including Rolls Royce , Shell and BP to create detailed designs for the " Aerogenerator " , a machine that rotates on its axis and would stretch nearly 275 m from blade tip to tip .
It is thought that the first machines will be built in 2013 - 14 following two years of testing .
But the all - British team of designers and engineers , which includes Eden project architects Grimshaw , is in stiff competition with other groups .
Earlier this year US wind company Clipper , which has close ties with the US Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory , announced plans to build 10 MW " Britannia " turbines in north - east England .
Based on a scaled - up version of the conventional wind turbines now common in the British landscape , these giants would be fixed to the sea bed but would stand nearly 600 ft high above the waves .
If they prove technically and financially feasible , each turbine should be able to generate enough electricity to provide 5,000 - 10,000 homes and , says Clipper , should create energy equivalent to 2 m barrels of oil in their 25 - year lifetime .
Meanwhile , Norwegian firm Sway is planning to build massive floating turbines that would stick straight out of the sea from 100 m - deep floating " masts " anchored to the sea bed .
An EU - sponsored research project is also investigating 8 –10 MW turbines , and other American and Danish companies are planning 9MW machines .
Full - scale prototyes of all three leading designs are expected to be complete within three years .
" There is a wonderful race on .
It 's very tight and the prize is domination of the global offshore wind energy market , " said Feargal Brennan , head of offshore engineering at Cranfield University , where much of the Aerogenerator development work has been carried out .
" The UK has come late to the race , but with 40 years of oil and gas experience we have the chance to lead the world .
The new [ Aero - generator ] turbine is based on semi-submersible oil platform technology and does not have the same weight constraints as a normal wind turbine .
The radical new design is half the height of an equivalent [ conventional ] turbine , " he said .
He added that the design could be expanded to produce turbines that generated 20 MW or more .
The largest wind turbines currently installed are mostly rated at around 3MW .
By comparison , coal power stations typically have a capacity in gigawatts , or thousands of megawatts – it would take 180 of the new giant turbines to generate the equivalent capacity of a coal power station proposed this year for North Ayshire , Scotland .
Engineers say that scale is the key to wind power .
Doubling the diameter of a conventional wind turbine theoretically produces four times as much power , but weighs eight times as much and can increase costs by a factor of eight .
Offshore power is widely regarded as the future of renewable energy because the wind is much more reliable at sea , larger machines are possible to transport and install and there is far less public opposition .
On land , massive cranes and blades have to be driven to remote hilltops , and planning permission can take many years .
However , the present generation of offshore turbines are 30 - 50 % more expensive than their terrestrial counterparts , are harder to maintain and are more prone to corrosion .
The market for offshore power is expected to grow to hundreds of billions of dollars a year .
Last year the European Wind Energy Association predicted that Europe would increase its offshore wind power from less than 2GW today to more than 150GW by 2030 .
Britain , which has little upland space available for large wind farms , overtook Denmark in offshore wind generation in 2008 and now leads the world with 330 offshore turbines installed .
It also has the world 's most ambitious plans to develop the wind resource , being committed to installing 12 GW of offshore power by 2012 .
This is the equivalent of 2,500 of the largest 5MW machines presently developed .
John Sauven , director of Greenpeace UK , said : " It is critical that the UK government does not hinder the development of offshore wind power by cutting budgets for short - term gain .
All our energy needs depend on this . "
The troubled newspaper industry has been railing for years about how the Internet is destroying their business model , and taking actions such as paywalls and talking about changing copyright law .
Now , one newspaper is going further -- it 's taking bloggers that posted its stories to court , with the result that a number of blogs have been shut down and are facing multi- thousand - dollar settlement charges .
TheLas Vegas Review - Journal set up an agreement with Righthaven LLC that enables Righthaven to sue , on behalf of the Review - Journal , bloggers who reposted content from the paper .
And it has done so , filing nearly 80 cases , regardless of whether the blog was commercial or gave credit to the source .
While some have claimed Righthaven has a right - wing agenda and is focusing on liberal blogs , conservative blogs have also been targeted .
" Righthaven has offered no prior contact , cease - and - desist warnings or any attempt at good - faith resolution whatsoever , " reported The Armed Citizen , which posted six articles from the Las Vegas paper among 4,700 articles it has posted on the subject of Second Amendment rights .
" The Armed Citizen has been excerpting articles from newspaper , TV station , and radio station websites for a number of years without a single complaint or infringement notice . "
( Joe Strupp , of Media Matters , notes that , thus far , conservative Nevada political candidates who have posted entire articles have not yet been targeted , raising the possibility that the candidates need to account for an in - kind donation for use of the articles . )
Certainly , by the law , bloggers who posted text of entire articles were wrong , even if they cited the source .
On the other hand , Righthaven 's action resembles that of law firms that make money by systematically filing Americans with Disabilities
Act lawsuits against a whole string of businesses in a city , regardless of whether a disabled person has actually had an issue , or Recording Industry Association of America copyright suits against 12 - year - old girls .
Is the goal here really to protect the copyright , or to shake down a variety of individuals who do n't have the resources to fight it ?
In one case , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) , settled its case , for a single article , for $ 2,185 .
$ 2000 an article is more than $ 150,000 for the 80 suits , even if the bloggers posted just a single article -- and some of them , like the Armed Citizen , posted several .
In addition , there are the legal costs involved .
In another case , the blog in question was one about cats in cities -- a blog with no advertising and no commercial potential whatsoever , writes James Rainey in the Los Angeles Times .
In still another case , the news article was posted in the comments section by a third party and was soon removed by the blog owner .
Ironically , in one case , a blog from a progressive organization is being sued for posting an article for which it was the source of the news , which some articles noted would make it difficult to do such reporting in the future .
" It the height of stupidity for a news organization to sue its own source over display of an article in which the defendant figures prominently , " noted one , adding that the lawsuit ran the real risk of actually bankrupting the organization in question .
And in general , the lawsuits make it more difficult for reporters to write about anything associated with the nearly 80 defendants in question .
" Simply put , this puts the RJ's reporters and photographers in a serious conflict with just about everything they cover , " writes the media watchdog blog LV Journal Review .
More than money may be at stake -- according to the filing associated with at least one of the lawsuits , Righthaven is also demanding " names and addresses ( whether electronic mail addresses or otherwise ) of any person with whom the Defendants have communicated regarding the Defendants ’ use of the Work " -- meaning , a list of all the blogs ' members ? -- and rights to the domain names of the blogs under litigation .
The bigger question is whether other newspapers , emboldened by Righthaven 's action , may be tempted to follow the same course .
" Ca n't we acknowledge that copyright law has a righteous purpose , to protect original content and encourage creators to create even more ? , " the LA Times ' Rainey wrote .
" Ca n't we also admit that a little creative reuse , far from thievery , can drive new attention to good work ?
The rub has been where to draw the line to determine what , exactly , constitutes " fair use . " "
Rainey recommends that bloggers not republish more than three paragraphs , always name the source , and always link to the original .
July 16 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama ’s request for more money to pay for the war in Afghanistan is working its way through Congress slowly as lawmakers concentrate on other priorities and deal with scarce budget resources .
Obama has asked for $ 33 billion more to help fund 30,000 extra U.S. soldiers being sent to Afghanistan this year .
He wants $ 4.5 billion more for beefed - up foreign aid and civilian operations in Iraq and Afghanistan this year ; about $ 2 billion of that amount is dedicated to Afghanistan .
The House of Representatives approved the funding last month and added billions of dollars in non-military spending , meaning the measure must return to the Senate for final approval .
Lawmakers are expected to pass the funds , but are also demanding assurances that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai tackles corruption to ensure U.S. taxpayer dollars are not wasted .
Following are the costs to U.S. taxpayers so far , as well as some of the future funding needed .
COSTS SO FAR
Congress has approved $ 345 billion so far for the war in Afghanistan , which the United States invaded to fight al Qaeda and topple the Taliban after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , which produced the figure , said about $ 22 billion has gone for Afghan - war - related activities in other countries .
COMPARISON WITH IRAQ
Some $ 708 billion has gone to the Iraq war so far , CBO says .
But Afghanistan is becoming the more expensive battleground , as the pace of U.S. military operations slows in Iraq and quickens in Afghanistan .
The current fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30 , is the first in which more money has been allocated to Afghanistan ( $ 72.3 billion ) than Iraq ( $ 64.5 billion ) , according to the National Priorities Project , a nonpartisan budget research group that examines congressional appropriations .
MONEY FOR AFGHANISTAN’S MILITARY AND POLICE FORCES
Included in the money spent on Afghanistan is more than $ 25 billion for training and equipping the Afghan National Security Forces -- the army and police , according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction .
Obama wants another $ 14.2 billion for this purpose for the rest of this year and next ; the idea is to leave behind security forces that can take on the responsibility of fighting the Taliban as U.S. forces start to leave .
FUTURE MILITARY COSTS
Future expenses are a question mark , partly because troop levels are uncertain .
Obama says he wants to start withdrawing forces from Afghanistan in mid-2011 , but that will depend on conditions on the ground .
No departure deadline has been set .
Estimates of the cost per troop per year in Afghanistan vary from $ 500,000 to $ 1 million depending on whether expenditures on housing and equipment are included along with pay , food and fuel .
Medical costs and veterans ’ compensation balloon as time goes on .
FOREIGN AID AND CIVILIAN SURGE
Foreign aid , including food and development assistance , to Afghanistan has totaled some $ 17 billion since 2002 , according to Department of State and Congressional Research Service documents .
Future expenses are unknown and there is growing concern among lawmakers over corruption in Karzai ’s government .
Rep. Nita Lowey , a Democrat who heads the House appropriations subcommittee on foreign aid , last month froze about $ 3.9 billion in civilian aid to Afghanistan pending hearings on how Afghanistan and its U.S. partners intend to handle corruption .
The State Department is seeking more money to help fund a “ civilian stabilization strategy ” to deliver more economic assistance to Afghanistan , especially its agricultural sector .
Part of the idea is to create jobs that will draw insurgents off the battlefield in Afghanistan .

Update : Civil rights attorney arrested in police confrontation
The Center for Constitutional Rights just sent out the following release …
This afternoon , CCR Attorney Sunita Patel was arrested while carrying out her legal observer duties at a protest of ArizonaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s unconstitutional immigration law , SB 1070 .
As police began a sweep , Ms. Patel began to take down names of those being arrested and was promptly arrested herself .
Witnesses say legal observers were deliberately targeted by police .
Said CCR Legal Director Bill Quigley , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Arresting a young woman of color who is there as an attorney observer demonstrates how irresponsible and un-American the Arizona action is .
I fear Arizona is starting to act like Mississippi in the civil rights days .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 

Several hundred activists marched here Thursday as a new Arizona immigration law went into effect , sparking a tense standoff with riot police in which about two dozen people were arrested .
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer appealed against a judge ’s injunction stripping the most contentious sections from the legislation , as angry protestors were met by scores of police in riot gear .
Civil rights groups marched through Phoenix , the capital of Arizona , to denounce the new law , even though a judge has temporarily stripped it of key powers allowing police to spot check the immigration status of all suspects .
Judge Susan Bolton ruled Wednesday that those powers would place a burden on legal resident aliens living in Arizona , where one in three of the 6.6 million people is foreign - born and an estimated 460,000 are illegal immigrants .
Protestors urged schools , town and city governments and local police departments not to comply with the law , which they say amounts to ethnic profiling .
ADVERTISEMENT
Waving Mexican and US flags , the activists marched on the courthouse and the offices of tough county sheriff Joe Arpaio , brandishing banners demanding “ Stop the Raids , No More Deportations ” and “ Stop Targeting Immigrants Now . ”
About a dozen demonstrators chained themselves to the metal doors of the Marciopa country jail until sheriff ’s deputies emerged from the building to take them inside , an AFP correspondent saw .
Arpaio warned that those causing disturbances will be arrested , and Phoenix authorities told AFP that about two dozen people had been detained .

In a challenge to the immigrant groups , Arpaio said some 200 police and volunteers would be patrolling the streets on Thursday on the lookout for illegal immigrants in the 17th such sweep by his deputies .
“ We ’re going to hit certain areas valley - wide , which includes cities , that we feel that the human smuggling is taking place , ” he told reporters .
ADVERTISEMENT
Activists accused the authorities of fostering “ a climate of hate . ”
“ They ’re not hiding their intentions , and we intend to resist , ” said Alfredo Gutierrez , a former state senator and activist with the Somos America rights group .
But officials in Arizona , which borders Mexico , argue the US administration has failed to secure the borders , and they are overwhelmed by illegal immigrants .
ADVERTISEMENT
Brewer , who signed the bill into law in April , appealed against the judge ’s injunction , vowing to take the fight to the Supreme Court .
“ Illegal immigration is an ongoing crisis the state of Arizona did not create and the federal government has refused to fix , ” she said , urging the courts to expedite the appeal .
Judge Bolton on Wednesday suspended the most contested parts of the law hours before it went into effect at one minute after midnight ( 0701 GMT Thursday ) .
She ruled that sections handing police the power to check the immigration status of all suspected criminals and making it a crime not to carry proper papers were suspended .
ADVERTISEMENT
She also temporarily froze a section making it a crime for illegal immigrants to solicit work — a clause aimed at the queues of people who gather early every day waiting for employers to drive by and offer them spot jobs .
The row over the Arizona law has thrust the issue of the nation ’s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants once more into the spotlight , after a series of failed legislative attempts to bring them out of the shadows .
“ This is just a backfire of the economic policies that the US is implementing on third world nations , ” said Jorge Perez , who traveled to the protest with a group of labor activists from San Diego .
“ I ’ve talked to a lot of immigrant laborers , who come here for work , and they say they hate it here , ” he added .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ They ’d rather be at home , but they have no choice , ” said Perez , who claimed free trade agreements were to blame for economic misery in Latin America .
The Obama administration has filed one of seven legal challenges to the law being heard by Bolton , and she ruled it would likely succeed in arguing that the federal government has responsibility over immigration policy .

There are many ways to row a boat , but it took a physicist to figure out which should work best
IT IS 7 am on a cloudy Monday morning and the banks of the river Thames in west London are humming with activity in preparation for an experiment .
At the Imperial College Boat Club , the men ’s rowing eight are about to take to the water in an unusual boat .
The placement of rowers in a boat – its “ rig ” – conventionally has the oars arranged alternately to the left and right .
In this boat , however , the order is seemingly random .
As the crew gingerly takes to the water , the first two men are pulling to the left , the next four to the right and the final two to the left .
The crew is testing a rig suggested by John Barrow , a mathematical physicist at the University of Cambridge .
According to Barrow ’s calculations , this configuration should outperform the standard rig in one very important way .
The puzzle is that this configuration has never been used in a top - class competitive race , as far as Barrow can tell .
“ The rig seems entirely new to rowing , ” he says .
So this morning ’s paddle , at New Scientist ’s suggestion , is a rough test of whether his calculations have the ring of truth .
The force generated by an oar being pulled through water has been well studied by rowing coaches .
Though the size and direction of this force varies throughout the stroke , it can always be resolved into two components : one that pushes the boat forward and …
People may work to pay the rent , gain accolades or contribute to society .
But a new study suggests another reason why we do anything : to save us from boredom .
In fact , we so dread dawdling that we 'll take up a meaningless task as long as we find some way to justify it to ourselves , the researchers say .
However , the results show humans are wary of work without reason : Participants chose idleness over activity if they felt the task was a waste of time .
Such reluctance to accept busywork might come at a cost to our happiness .
Across the board , participants were happier if they were busy than if they were idle .
The results suggest people should stay occupied , even if their activity serves no purpose .
For instance , make a mess just to clean it up , or take something apart just to put it back together again .
Such work is a better alternative than engaging in busy , yet destructive activity , such as crimes , the researchers say .
Business brings happiness
The findings are based on two experiments .
In the first , 98 college - age participants were told they would fill out surveys about their school , and must leave all personal items at the door .
After the students finished one survey , they were told the next would not be ready for 15 minutes .
In their free time , they could either drop their first survey off at a location right outside the door , or at place farther away .
It would take about 12 to 15 minutes to walk to the second location and back .
The students would receive a candy once they turned in their survey .
Some students were told that no matter which location they went to , the candy would be the same — a piece of milk or dark chocolate .
Others were told that one location offered only milk chocolate , while the other offered only dark chocolate .
A prior test had indicated that the students , on average , did not have a preference for milk or dark chocolate .
Students in the first group had no reason to go to the more distant location since the candy they received would be the same either way .
The latter group did n't really have a reason either , since students generally liked milk and dark chocolate the same .
But a student could justify the longer trip by saying he or she preferred the candy offered at the farther location .
When the candies offered at the two locations were the same , most students , 68 percent , chose to drop off the survey at the nearby location .
But when the candies were different , the majority , 59 percent , took the long walk .
In general , those who kept themselves occupied by walking were happier in the last 15 minutes of the experiment than those who chose to be idle .
The second experiment , involving 54 participants , was the same as the first , except that students were told which location to deliver the survey to — they did n't have a choice .
Again , students who were busy the entire time by walking to the farther location were happier than students who waited idly in the last 15 minutes .
Build a bridge to nowhere
When the researchers described the first experiment to a group of 52 participants , most said those who kept themselves busy would be happier .
This suggests that , although we know business brings happiness , we can't bring ourselves to do something without reason .
Our desire to justify everything we do might have evolutionary underpinnings .
" In their strife for survival , human ancestors had to conserve energy to compete for scarce resources ; expending energy without purpose could have jeopardized survival , " the researchers write in the July issue of the journal Psychological Science .
So how do we overcome this aversion to idleness ?
Since we do n't know what 's best for ourselves , the researchers suggest those with authority should take the lead .
" Governments may increase the happiness of idle citizens by having them build bridges that are actually useless , " they write .
Some of these interventions actually already exist , the researchers say .
" Airports have tried to increase the happiness ( or reduce the unhappiness ) of passengers waiting at the baggage carousel by increasing the distance between the gate and the baggage claim area , forcing them to walk far rather than wait idly , " they write .
In this part of the country , the potentially enormous natural gas play of the Marcellus Shale has many residents lining up to lease their land to gas prospectors .
Estimates vary on the precise size of the Marcellus Shale , which stretches from West Virginia across much of Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio and into the Southern Tier of New York .
But by any estimate , the gas deposit is huge  perhaps as much as 500 trillion cubic feet .
( New York State uses a little over 1.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas each year . )
An industry - financed study published this week suggested that as much as $ 6 billion in government revenue and up to 280,000 jobs could be at stake in the Marcellus Shale region .
Fracking has been around for decades , and it is an increasingly prominent tool in the effort to unlock previously unreachable gas reserves .
The oil and gas industry estimates that 90 percent of the more than 450,000 operating gas wells in the United States rely on hydraulic fracturing .
Roughly 99.5 percent of the fluids typically used in fracking , the industry says , are just water and sand , with trace amounts of chemical thickeners , lubricants and other compounds added to help the process along .
The cocktail is injected thousands of feet below the water table and , the industry argues , ca n’t possibly be responsible for growing complaints of spoiled streams and wells .
But critics say that the relationship between fracking fluids and groundwater contamination has never been thoroughly studied  and that proving a link has been made more difficult by oil and gas companies that have jealously guarded as trade secrets the exact chemical ingredients used at each well .

Several other concerns linger over fracking , as well as other aspects of gas drilling  including the design and integrity of well casings and the transport and potential spilling of chemicals and the millions of gallons of water required for just one fracking job .
The recent string of accidents in the oil and gas industries  including the gulf spill and a blowout last month at a gas field in Clearfield County , Pa. , that spewed gas and wastewater for 16 hours  has unnerved residents and regulators .
Most local planners view some accommodation of projected population increases as the " right thing to do " and reluctantly support " No Growth " policies when forced to by their elected officials and / or voters .
Many of us work and / or live in communities with growth pressure where some of the amenities and quality of life that residents enjoy are threatened by growth .
Following are four arguments to respectfully offer the " No Growth " alternative as an arguable position for local planners .
1. There Is No End To Population Growth
In California , planners talk about " the next 15 million Californians by 2020 " as if that is the sum population to accommodate with housing and jobs and water , and then we 're done .
But five years from now we 'll be talking about " the next 15 million Californians by 2025 " ; and five years later , " 15 million by 2030 . "
There is no foreseeable end in site to growth in California and , to varying degrees , in many other areas of the Nation .
Based on the Census Bureau 's national population projections over your lifetime and children's , any desirable area is going to see continuous demand from internal growth , intra-state migration ( as increasingly digital job - holders seek out desirable places to live ) , and international migration .
If your city or county develops housing and jobs to meet 20 - year projections , the No Growth argument is that it will only encourage more people in the long - term as well .
The analogy is an added freeway lane -- there is a temporary reduction in traffic volume which attracts more drivers and congestion returns .
Arguably , there are really only two future scenarios for communities in desirable areas : 1 ) high housing costs with some preserved open space and agricultural and 2 ) high housing costs without open space and agriculture .
Accommodating growth never ends , therefore the rational choice is to draw the line now while you still have something to save , no matter the consequences .
2. Buildout Is A Myth
As the activist cities and counties shut down growth one by one , growth will flow like water down the path of least resistance .
General Plans will change little by little -- a parcel here , a policy there -- as market pressures increase .
Homeowners will be tempted to " cash out " their equity rather than stay and fight development since tax laws now allow substantial tax - free capital gains .
Rents will rise and make recycling of older commercial areas profitable .
Infill and Smart Growth policies are temporary fixes .
There are only so many infill sites , and Smart Growth may raise the average density but in the long run that , too , will eventually " fill up . "
More and more surrounding open spaces are being taken ' off the market ' for species habitat or water sheds or parks or preserves .
Here in California , finding new sources of water is now a bigger hurdle and no county or city wants to front infrastructure costs .
Several counties have effectively shut down the conversion of agriculture to urban uses by requiring voter approval of " open space to urban " General Plan amendments , a relatively simple and court - tested method that may spread across the country .
All these events are slowly drawing a noose around entire regions of existing urban areas as opposed to just one or two cities here and there .
As a result , we are seeing longer " interregional commuting . "
There are exceptions for pro-growth areas but even these areas will soon find themselves inundated with development and congestion so intense that they , too , may change their tune .
In a state of constant population growth , you either build up or out , and building out is becoming less and less of an option and building up is contentious .
The third alternative is to " just say no " , although few planners willingly take that position .
3 . It Should n't Only Be Just A " Buyer 's Market "
Our legal system favors the " buyer " when it comes to growth .
In a sense , local governments and their communities are " sellers " and the new households ( formed by current residents or newcomers ) are the " buyers . "
We shop for communities that offer the best mix of amenities for our dollars and what we can or want to spend .
Local governments , on the other hand , are required to provide services to everyone within their jurisdiction , if you find a place to live .
Unfortunately , the poor will always get pushed around in a market - based economy and there are very few communities willing to risk being inundated with additional population as a result of trying to increase housing supply to help the local low - income population .
In many cases , the new housing leads to the middle class " spreading out " and / or a second home market and the poor are still crowded into a small corner or , in some areas , forced out of the area and into long commutes .
Trying to accommodate rapid population growth in areas where it's not welcome is similar to correcting inherent flaws in both democracy -- in that incoming households cannot vote locally and local voters are motivated to protect what they have -- and our market - based economy , where higher income households will outbid the poor .
It 's a tall order that will likely fail .
Then , there is the underlying tension between regional and state governments and the business community who generally like some regular growth and those local voters who do n't want any growth and elect local officials with the same mandate .
For example , California 's Regional Housing Need Allocation program says , in essence , that local communities " have to sell " to future buyers at prices the buyers want to pay ( i.e. a range of values and rents ) .
Is n't that inherently unfair ?
The market should work both ways .
If buyers can look around and ' buy ' into a community that is being forced to produce housing at the buyer 's preferred price , then the selling communities should also have the right to sell at its preferred price .
If a community or region refuses to grow , the result may be higher prices , economic displacement and hardship , and dangerous crowded housing in exchange for keeping a desirable quality of life for the " already landed " middle - and upper - income groups .
If the local voters are willing to pay this price , why should planners try to prevent it ?
If you want to lessen those undesirable impacts , then restrict both supply and demand , but not just supply .
Otherwise the only control of demand is higher housing prices .
Who will win in a showdown between local " NIMBY - No Growth " and regional and state planning " you must take a fair share ? "
Who elects state legislators ?
If the stakes get high enough , look for a statewide No Growth " get rid of housing allocations " movement similar to the California Proposition 13 tax revolt of the 1970's .
Whose side do you want to be on ?
Welcome to the realities of a democracy and market - based economy .
4. No National Growth Policy , Self - Defense Is Your Right
It 's a national market for housing and growth -- and in some areas , international .
As long as the Federal Government has no real effective growth policies -- meaning where growth occurs -- then every community has " the right of self - defense . "
You could argue that the income tax deduction for mortgage interest and local real estate taxes and the every - two - years $ 250,000 capital gains exemption for sale of principal residence is a national growth policy , and that it encourages sprawl .
Both are large subsidies for homeownership that generally increase with the more you buy .
In decades past , the Federal Government subsidized and explicitly directed growth through transportation ( canals , railroads , and highways ) , land grants and sales , and other subsidies to local governments .
Those days are gone .
Some states are growing too fast while others have excess capacity .
It is therefore arguable that the national government should do more to be aware of unanticipated consequences of the tax code and direct growth among the states and metro-areas ?
As long as Congress and the White House have laissez - faire growth policies , No Growth is an arguable smart move .

The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author and intended to balance the Smart Growth debate by examining the No Growth arguments .
Most local planners view some accommodation of projected population increases as the " right thing to do " and reluctantly support " No Growth " policies when forced to by their elected officials and / or voters .

There are only so many infill sites , and Smart Growth may raise the average density but in the long run that , too , will eventually " fill up . "
More and more surrounding open spaces are being taken ' off the market ' for species habitat or water sheds or parks or preserves .
Here in California , finding new sources of water is now a bigger hurdle and no county or city wants to front infrastructure costs .
Several counties have effectively shut down the conversion of agriculture to urban uses by requiring voter approval of " open space to urban " General Plan amendments , a relatively simple and court - tested method that may spread across the country .
All these events are slowly drawing a noose around entire regions of existing urban areas as opposed to just one or two cities here and there .
As a result , we are seeing longer " interregional commuting . "
There are exceptions for pro-growth areas but even these areas will soon find themselves inundated with development and congestion so intense that they , too , may change their tune .
In a state of constant population growth , you either build up or out , and building out is becoming less and less of an option and building up is contentious .
The third alternative is to " just say no " , although few planners willingly take that position .
3 . It Should n't Only Be Just A " Buyer 's Market "
Our legal system favors the " buyer " when it comes to growth .
In a sense , local governments and their communities are " sellers " and the new households ( formed by current residents or newcomers ) are the " buyers . "
We shop for communities that offer the best mix of amenities for our dollars and what we can or want to spend .
Local governments , on the other hand , are required to provide services to everyone within their jurisdiction , if you find a place to live .
Unfortunately , the poor will always get pushed around in a market - based economy and there are very few communities willing to risk being inundated with additional population as a result of trying to increase housing supply to help the local low - income population .
In many cases , the new housing leads to the middle class " spreading out " and / or a second home market and the poor are still crowded into a small corner or , in some areas , forced out of the area and into long commutes .
Trying to accommodate rapid population growth in areas where it's not welcome is similar to correcting inherent flaws in both democracy -- in that incoming households cannot vote locally and local voters are motivated to protect what they have -- and our market - based economy , where higher income households will outbid the poor .
It 's a tall order that will likely fail .
Then , there is the underlying tension between regional and state governments and the business community who generally like some regular growth and those local voters who do n't want any growth and elect local officials with the same mandate .
For example , California 's Regional Housing Need Allocation program says , in essence , that local communities " have to sell " to future buyers at prices the buyers want to pay ( i.e. a range of values and rents ) .
Is n't that inherently unfair ?
The market should work both ways .
If buyers can look around and ' buy ' into a community that is being forced to produce housing at the buyer 's preferred price , then the selling communities should also have the right to sell at its preferred price .
If a community or region refuses to grow , the result may be higher prices , economic displacement and hardship , and dangerous crowded housing in exchange for keeping a desirable quality of life for the " already landed " middle - and upper - income groups .
If the local voters are willing to pay this price , why should planners try to prevent it ?
If you want to lessen those undesirable impacts , then restrict both supply and demand , but not just supply .
Otherwise the only control of demand is higher housing prices .
Who will win in a showdown between local " NIMBY - No Growth " and regional and state planning " you must take a fair share ? "
Who elects state legislators ?
If the stakes get high enough , look for a statewide No Growth " get rid of housing allocations " movement similar to the California Proposition 13 tax revolt of the 1970's .
Whose side do you want to be on ?
Welcome to the realities of a democracy and market - based economy .
4. No National Growth Policy , Self - Defense Is Your Right
It 's a national market for housing and growth -- and in some areas , international .
As long as the Federal Government has no real effective growth policies -- meaning where growth occurs -- then every community has " the right of self - defense . "
You could argue that the income tax deduction for mortgage interest and local real estate taxes and the every - two - years $ 250,000 capital gains exemption for sale of principal residence is a national growth policy , and that it encourages sprawl .
Both are large subsidies for homeownership that generally increase with the more you buy .
In decades past , the Federal Government subsidized and explicitly directed growth through transportation ( canals , railroads , and highways ) , land grants and sales , and other subsidies to local governments .
Those days are gone .
Some states are growing too fast while others have excess capacity .
It is therefore arguable that the national government should do more to be aware of unanticipated consequences of the tax code and direct growth among the states and metro-areas ?
As long as Congress and the White House have laissez - faire growth policies , No Growth is an arguable smart move .

The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author and intended to balance the Smart Growth debate by examining the No Growth arguments .
As promised , an explanation .
This is the “ Command Not Found ” runner .
For those of you who may not be familiar , command - not - found is a magical little command line tool that gets activated when the shell cannot find the binary you wish to launch .
It has a database of binaries and package names , and can check to see which package contains the binary you tried to type .
If it finds one , it tells you which package to install to get this binary .
But I find that I use KRunner for launching my stuff more often these days .
On new installs , I instinctually go to KRunner and try to type in the name of my favorite app .
But then I get nothing ; realizing that this is a new install and I have yet to install this piece of software .
I mumble , backspace , and type in the name of my favorite package manager .
I then type in the name of the application I wanted ( again ) and mark it for installation .
… but would n’t it be nice if I did n’t have to ?
I do n’t anymore , thanks to the Command Not Found runner .
I was browsing the KDE brainstorm section of the KDE forums and saw this idea .
I thought it was neat and actually feasible , so yesterday I sat down and hacked .
By the end of the day , the installer / command not found runner was born !
Here ’s how it works :
Whenever KRunner cannot find an application via KService , the Command Not Found runner takes what you typed and tells the command - not - found utility to find which package has that program .
If command - not - found finds anything , the runner returns a result .
Click that result , and it starts qapt - batch , telling it to install that package .
You just have to enter your password , and qapt - batch will do all the rest .
Neat !
As an added bonus , if the runner detects that the program you are trying to run has a different name than the package it is in , it gives a nice , helpful little subtext that explains that the amarok package contains “ amarokpkg ” , even though the package is n’t named “ amarokpkg ” .
A few notes based on the comments my mysterious post last night introduced :
This is not meant to replace traditional package management .
It is just a little convenience feature that can only ever install things that are n’t installed .
It will never do anything more than that package management - wise .
Going back to the first point , it is ( in general ) a good thing that you have to know the exact name of the program to get this to show up .
It limits the usecase of this service to those who forgot that they had n’t installed $ app yet , and will have a very small likelihood of showing up for somebody who is not trying to run $ app .
There would really be no reason to not enable this by default , especially since KRunner is somewhat of a hidden feature in the first place …
The KRunner plugin can be turned off .
It does not do any package management itself .
It leaves the installation to a real batch installer program .
If the user does not have the privileges to install packages , it will not show up .
At the moment , it only works on Debian - based systems , since it requires the Debian command - not - found program .
Sorry ’bout that .
😦
I just do n’t see a way that this could be done in a cross - distro manner right now …
It was simple to code , however , so it should n’t be too much trouble to make one for another distro , if you know how their command - not - found works ( if they have one , of course )
Going back to the KDE Brainstorm post , it is definitely feasible to add this to Kickoff .
It does require a one - line patch , however , so that pretty much limits it to people who want to patch kickoff themselves to get the runner to show results there …
It would be neat if we could make certain “ categories ” of runners , and then have kickoff configured to only show the results of certain categories .
At the moment there ’s a whitelist that you have to add to before they ’ll show .
I ’ll try to get packages up in the next few days , but due to my impending vacation I do n’t know how successful I ’ll be in actually getting around to it .
You can grab the source here if you want to .
It should just need kdelibs5 - dev to build .

An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said the army views Gaza 's Hamas rulers as the sole party responsible for the rocket attacks against Israel .
The 36 - hour tit - for - tat began Friday , when a rocket fired by Gaza militants exploded in the coastal Israeli city of Ashkelon .
The IAF struck three targets in Gaza Friday night , which Palestinian sources described as the heaviest assault since Operation Cast Lead , Israel 's three - week assault on the Gaza Strip a year and a half ago .
A Hamas operative , a 40 - year - old member of Hamas ' military wing , was killed in an explosion near the Nuseirat refugee camp south of Gaza City in the center of the Hamas - controlled strip .
Another 13 Palestinians were hurt .
Hamas has vowed revenge for the militant leader 's death .
Palestinian militants then fired a Qassam rocket Saturday night , which hit the Sha'ar Hanegev regional council area in the Negev , just hours after the first IAF strike on Gaza .
According to the IDF spokesperson 's office , the rocket damaged the structure 's rooftop and destroyed most of the second floor of the building , which serves during the day as a daycare center for people with disabilities .
No injuries were reported in the attack .
IDF patrol units have been scanning the area for the rocket 's remains .

Racism affects online sales across much of the nation , suggests a study .
In the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research effort by economists Jennifer Doleac and Luke Stein , at least least three online ads for a used Apple iPod were placed in 300 regions nationwide from 2009 to 2010 .
" Each ad contained a photo of the iPod held by a black hand , a white hand , or a white hand with a wrist tattoo , " says the study .
The economists ran each ad for 12 hours , offering to sell the iPod to the highest bidder .
What they found :
• Black sellers received 13 percent fewer responses and 17 percent fewer offers than white sellers .
•
The average offer received by black sellers was 2 percent to 4 percent lower , despite the self - selected — and presumably less biased — pool of bidders responding to these ads .
•
The effects were similar for tattooed sellers , suggesting a role for statistical discrimination .
•
Buyers corresponding with black sellers exhibited lower trust :
They were 17 percent less likely to include their name in e-mails , 44 percent less likely to accept delivery by mail , and 56 percent more likely to express concern about making a long - distance payment .
" Clearly , black sellers are at a significant disadvantage to whites , " say the authors , particularly in places where few iPods went on sale , where black sellers received 24 % fewer offers .
In markets where 20 or more iPods went on sale a week , there was little discrimination .
Only in Western states did buyers not make fewer offers to black sellers .
In the Northeast , they received 32 % less ; in the Midwest , 23 % fewer ; and in the South , 15 % fewer .
Black sellers also received fewer offers in high - crime and racially segregated regions .
" Black sellers are at a significant disadvantage on average , but their outcomes depend greatly on various features of their local markets , including the level of competition and the degree to which local buyers are wary , " concludes the study .

Northwest to pay $ 38 million cargo price - fixing fine
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Northwest Airlines will plead guilty and pay a $ 38 million fine for conspiring to fix cargo rates , the Justice Department announced Friday .
In a felony charge filed Friday , the Justice Department said Northwest Airlines Cargo earned more than $ 80 million from air cargo services between the United States and Japan after the company conspired to fix those rates in violation of federal antitrust laws .
The alleged price - fixing occurred between July 2004 and February 2006 , prior to Northwest 's merger with Delta Air Lines ( DAL , Fortune 500 ) .
Northwest agreed to pay the fine and cooperate with an ongoing investigation into an industry - wide conspiracy to fix rates .
The company has also fired the person " it believed had primary responsibility for the conduct in question , " Delta said in a statement following the plea agreement .
" The agreement does n't assert any misconduct by any current or former officer or member " of the company 's board of directors , Delta 's statement said .
Another 15 carriers - including British Airways , Korean Air Lines , Qantas Airways and Cathay Pacific Airways -- have already either pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty in the Justice Department 's investigation , paying out $ 1.6 billion in criminal fines , the department said .
Four executives from Qantas , British Airways and SAS Cargo Group have also been sentenced to serve prison time , and charges are pending against a fifth executive , the department said .
We have all had our share of shouting and screaming teachers in our school days and it always made me wondered if there can be some consequence to it .
Seems there is – 39 - year old Teacher , Valissa Julietta Bauer , from Australia claims that all the screaming damaged her larynx .
She claims that she had to shout to control the pupils in her composite Year 6 and 7 class at Thabeban State School in Bundaberg , Queensland which included – 31 special needs children , including a diabetic child who required insulin injections , two autistic children , a child with cardiac disorders and a few children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder .
She is suing the state goverment for almost $ 350,000 for the damage as they failed to get her assistance for the classes .
She claims the school failed to regularly rotate her between various duties , to reduce her contact with the composite class .
Ms Bauer also blames the school for failing to supervise or ensure that the correct number of staff were available to monitor the high number of students in the Year 6 and 7 class .
She also claims she received inadequate training to prevent her being injured .
Her claim is for almost $ 420,009 in damages for personal injury as a result of alleged negligence , breach of contract or statutory duties .

I wonder if the students had some ear / hearing related damage ?
Bring the Noise
Anybody who ’s been anywhere near a moving electric car has probably been astounded by the stealth of it ’s silent approach , but this became a safety concern for some special interest groups , who felt that industry standards were needed for everyone ’s greater safety .
The question is n’t so much ‘ why ’ , as much as it is ‘ how ’ this noise will be made , and ‘ what ’ will it sound like ?
So , back in 2008 , the experts at the Geneva - based United Nations Economic Commission for Europe , the body responsible for harmonizing global vehicle regulations , started working on a set of minimum noise standards designed to prevent the uber - quiet Electric Vehicles ( EV’s ) from becoming a safety risk to Pedestrians – particularly young children and the blind .
The results of this initiative are the Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians ( VSP ) standards , which we can already see ( uhm ‘ hear ’ ) demonstrated in the new Nissan Leaf .
On a pragmatic note …
Obviously , the underlying and universal ideal that ’s being pursued in this initiative is to help both Drivers and Pedestrians avoid the risk of collision , of course .
Yet , is n’t this need already governed by the regulation of ‘ when ’ , ‘ where ’ , and ‘ how ’ it ’s actually safe to step out onto a roadway to begin with ?
If traffic lights and crosswalks are n’t amenable or audibly functional for those at risk , then it seems abit superfluous to try and make vehicles louder to compensate for any ( alleged ? ) safety shortcomings in the existing infrastructure and crossing points .
Surely this is n’t about making it easier for those at risk to jaywalk , or play out in the middle of streets to begin with !
This initiative seems to be more about assuring some peace of mind for leisurely behavior on quieter streets ( and certainly in driveways ) , by forcing cars to remain as audible as they ’ve always been , rather than everyone benefiting from one more of the pleasant side effects of silent EV technology .
As it turns out , there are those who wish to balance these objectives by making sure that these new standards only get applied below a minimum speed , and even most importantly when EV ’s are moving in reverse …
Which is where the greatest safety benefits to all can be realized .
As it stands though , any global regulation standards wo n’t likely be put into place before 2013 , although Japanese manufacturers are already moved ahead with voluntary noise guidelines of their own , which have resulted in a wide variety of different sounds being produced by EV’s .
This leaves the door wide open to finally offering the world a futuristic car that at least sounds like something that we were promised in the Jetson ’s so long ago now …
So we can at least we can look forward to a facsimile of the future finally arriving here in the 21st century .
Meet George Jetson …
Developing the Nissan Leaf VSP Vechicle Sound for Pedestrians
Critics of this initiative are calling this a license to emit noise pollution , rather than requiring Pedestrians to adhere to existing traffic rules , and of course requiring EV motorists to drive safely to begin with .
One ca n’t help but wonder how many millions were spent to develop what basically amounts to a sound effect for electric cars .
Ironically , even after we ’ve considered ways to make bikes more politely audible in our look at Bike Bell Protocols , there ’s no requirement ( as yet ) to make the swarms of new E - Bikes any more inaudible than they already are , even though they already make less sound than either a bike ( coasting with the sound of it ’s hub ratchet clicking ) , or of EV ’s that at least emit tire noise .
Hmnn…Surely it ’s nothing that a few more studies and research grants could n’t fix .
In the meantime we could always just figure out how to attach a modern version of baseball cards to our spokes again …
As we ’ve been discussing over in “ Ringing Around the World ”
It would be easy to start this section off by repeating the old adage that you get what you pay for .
To a fair extent that is true , but there are certainly exceptions .
Some very expensive mainboards are notorious poor performers ( bought an ASUS lately ? ) and once in a blue moon you strike a cheaply built little board that seems to be far more capable and reliable than it has any right to be .
But these are exceptions .
On the whole , the quality of a mainboard depends on the amount of care that has gone into making it , and on the quality of the components .
Both of these cost money , and to get a decent board you need to be prepared to pay a little more than the lowest possible price .
But do n't be too quick to pay too much more !
Quite often the most expensive boards are no better than the honest middle of the road ones , just priced higher .
Sometimes they have extra features or better quality to justify the price , sometimes they do n't .
This section , however , is not about the normal variation in quality and reliability between typical motherboards .
It is about plain old - fashioned greed , and the cheap , shonky boards that sometimes result from it .
Here then , is a short gallery of the cheap , the nasty , and the outright fraudulent .
PC Chips fake cache 486 Let 's begin with the most famous of them all : the fake cache 486 boards that PC Chips produced in the mid-Nineties .
Take a careful look at it .
You can date the board quite easily : it has a Socket 3 connector for a 486 CPU ; and VESA slots , so it can't be a very early 486 board ( they had no VESA ) , nor can it be a late model one , because the last of the 486 boards had PCI slots .
Middle period 486 then .
Now look at the RAM slots : 4 30 - pin and 2 72 - pin .
That tells you that it is from the transitional phase when 30 - pin RAM was on the way out and 72 - pin RAM on the way in .
That puts it in the 1994 to 1995 period .
Memory can only go so far , but if it is to be trusted these were around in mid-1995 .
And they were everywhere !
They were probably the single most common 486 board you could buy for a little while .
What made them so successful ?
One thing , and one thing only : the price .
These things were going for AU$ 80 ex tax in trade quantities .
All the other 486 boards were around the $ 140 mark .
And most of the shops that were selling these were not paying sales tax either .
( We could go into a long explanation of the now defunct Australian sales tax regime here , and explain how about one third of the entire computer industry used a series of artful dodges to evade paying the 22 percent wholesale sales tax , and damn near ripped the guts out of the entire industry , but perhaps we can leave that for another day . )
Net result was that you could walk into a computer shop and buy a good 486 mainboard for about $ 180 retail .
Or you could walk into the fly - by - night shonkster 's shop three doors down the road and buy one of the boards in the illustration for $ 90 .
OK , it was n't legal , because the shonk was dodging sales tax , but he was the one who would go to jail if he ever got caught , not you , so why not ?
Even if he paid tax it was still only $ 110 .
A 486 board is a 486 board , is n't it ?
Let 's look a little closer .
We can start by looking at the board itself .
( Picture at right . )
On the top you can see the same no - name 486 board .
The board underneath is a Gigabyte 486VF , another board from the same general era .
Notice how much thicker the Gigabyte PCB is ?
That 's the first sign .
Some perfectly good main boards are quite thin , but in general thick boards are good boards , thin boards are thin because it 's cheaper to make them that way .
Now hold the board in both hands and flex it : it bends like cardboard .
Do the same with a good main board ( use an old one , because this is not good for them ) and it will bend less than half as far with the same force .
Nothing conclusive yet , but there is a second black mark .
Now let 's look at the chipset .
This is where it starts to get interesting .
← Easy enough to see that it 's a UMC chipset .
Nothing wrong with that is there ?
UMC stopped making chipsets not long after this , or at least stopped making them under the UMC name — UMC is are a major foundry and manufacture all sorts of semiconductors for outside companies under contract — but UMC 386 and 486 chipsets were perfectly OK .
But is it a UMC chipset ?
It seems an odd way to label it .
Compare to the other 486 chipsets at right and below .
Well , perhaps UMC just labeled their chipsets differently , with a peel - on sticky label rather than marking the actual chip itself ?
Nope : the chipset on the lower left is another UMC and , just like all the other UMC chipsets we have ever seen , the chips are labelled in the ordinary way .
Still not convinced ?
Well , let 's peel the label off and see what we get .
There it is , naked and anonymous .
And here at last we have the first of the several unique things about these boards : they had a rather special ' universal ' chipset .
Now a small shop buying ten pieces at a time did n't get this choice , but if you were a bigger buyer you got the option .
" Want to buy some 486 boards ? " " What price ? " " If you take 100 pieces , $ 76 . " " OK .
What chipset are they ? "
" What chipset would you like ? "
No kidding .
That is exactly what went on — we never bought any , but we know people who did , and you could have any chipset you wanted .
Well , you could have any chipset label you wanted .
We only remember seeing these boards with UMC or PC Chips labels , but apparently you could ask for anything at all : UMC , SiS , Intel , you name it .
After all , from the importer 's point of view , if it helped close a sale for 500 motherboards , how much did it cost to get some sticky labels printed up ?
Now a couple of small things : look at the heatsink in the picture at right .
A lot of boards used cheap and nasty heatsinks for the CPU voltage regulators , including quite a few rather good ones , but it is one more of those small signs that add up to an overall total .
As with everything about these boards , the manufacturer has taken the cheapest possible option .
There are no sockets for the cache RAM chips or the BIOS chip either .
( See picture below and right . )
This meant that you could not replace a faulty cache chip or re-flash a faulty BIOS , but so what ?
In manufacturing quantities , those ten missing sockets per board probably cost a total of one dollar , and a dollar saved is a dollar earned .
By saving a couple of cents here and maybe a whole dollar there , they had managed to reduce the manufacturing cost of the mainboard by maybe five or ten US dollars .
That made it one of the cheapest boards on the market , but it still should have been costing them somewhere around AU$ 120 a piece to land boards in Australia .
They were already the poorest quality motherboard you could buy , but how did they manage to make a profit selling them for AU$ 80 ?
The answer is very , very simple : fraud .
A typical 486 mainboard had 256k of cache RAM .
You can see some in the picture below .
Now cache RAM needs to be faster than main RAM or it is useless .
In 1995 most standard fast page RAM was rated at 60 or 70 nanoseconds .
Cache RAM was usually rated at either 15 or 20 nanoseconds .
It was n't possible to get 20 nanosecond performance out of cheap dynamic RAM in those days , so cache RAM was always SRAM : static RAM , which uses a lot more transistors per bit and costs quite a lot more .
In fact , 256 k of static cache RAM in 1995 cost between $ 40 and $ 50 .
It was the single most expensive part of a motherboard .
In the early '90s some of the cheapest and scungiest distributors started selling low - end 486 boards with the cache sockets unpopulated .
( See picture at right . )
This made the boards cheaper but you can imagine what it did to the performance .
We saw quite a few 486SX - 33s with no mainboard cache RAM and they were very slow ; nowhere near as fast as a properly cached one .
Before too long people got wise to this , and refused to buy boards that had no cache RAM in their sockets .
After all , those rows of empty sockets stood out like dogs balls : even the most non-technical buyer would look at the board and ask what the missing stuff was .
Besides , for the retailer , leaving the cache out meant extra service calls .
The board was not just a lot slower , if it ever dropped its CMOS setup it would n't boot .
The factory BIOS default on 486 boards , quite sensibly , was external cache enabled .
With cache enabled but not actually present , the system can't boot .
You had to go into setup , switch of the cache in BIOS , and save the changes before it could start up .
Sure , it was a problem you could solve over the telephone , but then you had to explain why it had happened , and not many retailers like saying ' because , Sir , I sold you a motherboard with some parts missing from it because it was cheaper that way ' .
The fashion for leaving cache RAM out came and went quite quickly .
By 1995 it was all over .
Here is our friend the anonymous 486 board again .
See those black plastic things with metal legs on in the picture below ?
They look rather like cache RAM chips , do n't they ?
In fact , if you took the trouble to search out the part number in a semiconductor handbook , you 'd find that it indicates a 20 nanosecond cache RAM chip .
Only trouble is , those black plastic things with metal legs ain't cache RAM chips , they are ... well ... black plastic things with metal legs on .
The board below it is a variation on the theme : the same model of board , the same manufacturer , the same fraud , just different part numbers .
( In fact , this second one was faster : the top board took 20ns before it failed to function as advertised ; the bottom one , having fake chips marked as 15ns parts , under - performed 5 nanoseconds sooner . )
But surely it must have been a simple matter to detect this fraud ?
All you had to do is go into the BIOS , switch the external cache on , and see if the system hangs on boot or not ?
Nope : these boards worked just fine with the BIOS cache setting either way .
Well , they used to hang quite a lot , but that was just normal random hangs and crashes , something that cheap boards do all the time , not a complete failure to boot like you used to get with unpopulated cache socket boards .
How could this be so ?
How could the board run with cache enabled in BIOS but without any cache ?
Simple : the manufacturer had reprogrammed the BIOS to permanently disable external cache no matter which way you set it , and to report " 256 k cache enabled " during the boot sequence no matter what .
This too should have been reasonably easy to detect : all you had to do was swap the BIOS chip over with another board , and the deception would be unmasked .
And this is why the BIOS chip was soldered directly into the board , instead of being socketed : not just to save using a 10 c part , but so that you could n't easily remove it and detect the fraud .
The really silly thing about the fake cache boards was that they actually worked reasonably well some of the time .
Not very fast and usually not for very long , but they went OK with a DX - 66 or DX - 100 CPU .
They tended to have a lot of niggle problems — occasional GPFs , traps and hangs , inability to run certain programs , and they were absolutely hopeless as soon as you pushed the bus above 33 M Hz — so a DX - 80 , for example , was out of the question .
But of course , by removing the cache RAM and crippling the performance , they had also removed one of the most common problem areas in a mainboard .
With no cache issues to worry about , a board has to be really bad to give you problems .
These , in other words , were really bad .
Why did people buy them ?
Because they went to cut -rate fly - by - night dealers and bought on price alone .
And because the dealers also bought on price alone .
And it made a significant difference to the price : a decent quality board with 256 k cache RAM ( say an OPTi 895 or an FIC PVT ) in mid-95 when these were about was about $ 140 in trade quantities before tax or freight , those PC Chips things were selling for $ 80 .
The moral of the story ?
It is very easy to sit back and criticise the dealers who sold this fraudulent crap .
But why bother ?
Most of them are broke by now : you can't pull this sort of stunt forever ; sooner or later the public wake up to it .
And it 's easier still to criticise the wholesalers who imported it — several of the company directors responsible had nice long government sponsored holidays , though unfortunately not for this scam , it was unrelated crimes : tax evasion on a truly massive scale .
And we should rightly blame the Australian trade practice authorities did absolutely nothing about it because they , like their equivalents in other countries , were too ill - educated in matters technical to understand it .
Most of all , it is easy to blame the manufacturer who started the whole thing , and we most certainly do .
They are now one of the largest mainboard makers in the world , astonishingly enough .
We hope that the people responsible for the fake cache scam are no longer employed there , though we have no way of knowing .
But there is a deeper moral : in a way , the real culprits were the hordes of greedy retail buyers who made it all possible .
By relentlessly shopping on price , price and price , a great many Australian PC buyers left themselves wide open to this fraud .
In the end , the one essential thing that makes con tricks possible and practical is the greed of the victim .
To - do lists .
We all have them , but that does n't mean we have to like them .
Getting through a pile of boring chores is n't all that fun , but an upcoming iPhone app is looking to change that .
Dubbed EpicWin , the app aims to merge your to - do list with an RPG , letting you gain experience points and find rare loot as you do the laundry and catch up on e-mail .
The app is a joint venture between Rexbox — visual designer on LittleBigPlanet — and Mr. FungFung — the developer behind the iPhone game MiniSquadron .
Completing tasks will move you ahead on the in - game quest map , and venturing to new locations will earn you in - game items .
The app will also feature Facebook and Twitter integration , letting you share your triumphs with your friends .
And if the trailer is any indication , it looks like it will have plenty of style to spare .
" Rather than just mentally ticking off your chores , completing each one improves and develops your character in an ongoing quest to level - up , gain riches , and develop skills , " reads EpicWin 's official site .
" Doing the laundry is an epic feat of stamina so why not get stamina points for it ? ! "
EpicWin does n't currently have a release date , but according to the site , RPG fiends will be able to improve their productivity stats " soon . "

There is a shortage of livers for transplant
US scientists have created working liver grafts in the lab , and say the research could one day allow the growth of livers for transplant .
There is a shortage of liver donors , but so far it has been difficult to grow replacement organs .
In the work , published in Nature Medicine , a team from Massachusetts General Hospital , created successful grafts using rat cells .
A UK expert said it was " a big step in the right direction " .
Much more work will be required to make long - term functional liver grafts that can actually be transplanted into humans .
Dr Korkut Uygun , Researcher
In the study , scientists initially flushed out living liver cells , leaving behind a tissue " scaffold " .
They then introduced one type of liver cells called hepatocytes which successfully repopulated the scaffold .
When these were transplanted into rats , alongside their normal livers , they functioned normally for short periods .
The technique of washing out and replacing cells is the same as that used when a windpipe made with the patient 's own stem cells was successfully implanted in Spain in late 2008 in the world 's first tissue - engineered whole organ transplant .
Liver cells have been grown in the lab , but the difficulty has been making them work as part of an organ and connecting them to its vascular system .
Complex
The team from the Center for Engineering in Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital , led by Korkut Uygun , say their study has proved the concept works .
He added : " As far as we know , a transplantable liver graft has never been constructed in a laboratory setting before .
But he said : " Much more work will be required to make long - term functional liver grafts that can actually be transplanted into humans .
" We have n't been able to go beyond several hours in the rats , but it 's a great start . "
The team say their work could enable livers which are deemed unsuitable for transplant to be used as scaffolds .
However , they say much more work is needed before such grafts could be grown .
Mark Thursz , professor of hepatology at Imperial College London , said there were several issues to be overcome before it would be possible to create a liver graft that could work on its own .
One is that other types of cells are needed in addition to the hepatocytes .
In addition , the grafts created by the US team were only able to fulfil a small proportion of the functions of a normal liver .
Professor
Thursz said that , as well as the potential for creating new livers for people whose own organs had failed , it could be used to offer relief to patients with other liver problems .
" If you could create an artificial liver you could plumb someone into while their liver recovered , that would be helpful . "
" This is a big step in the right direction . "
Autobots Bumblebee , Ratchet , Ironhide , Mirage ( aka Dino ) , Wheeljack ( aka Que ) and Sideswipe led by Optimus Prime , are back in action taking on the evil Decepticons , who are eager to avenge their recent defeat .
The Autobots and Decepticons become involved in a perilous space race between the United States and Russia to reach a hidden Cybertronian spacecraft on the moon and learn its secrets , and once again Sam Witwicky has to go to the aid of his robot friends .
The new villain Shockwave is on the scene while the Autobots and Decepticons continue to battle it out on Earth .

If mods do n't feel like this would be appropriate , please lock this topic , but I know that there are tons of people on the forum who would love to have this topic to use .
To start out , here are a list of important Technical Metal bands to solve all the ' wankery please ' topics .
I 've chosen the ones that I 've either noticed to be often recommended , or pass my personal bar of technicality .
I 've excluded some bands that are considered a bit too ' core ' , but I can revise the list to include those if some want me to .
Bolded out the bands that I feel most people are looking for when they make their request threads .
This list features highly technical metal bands of all subgenres .
Acid Death
Aeon of Horus
Apocrypha
Algophobia
Anacrusis
Anata : Technical death metal with a piercing melodic flare and razor - sharp sense of harmony .
Adventurous , extremely varied song - writing , intelligent , innovative and very unique .
Anomalous
Antropofago
Appalling Spawn
Arsis
Atheist
Atheretic
Atrocity ( Deu ) :
Only the first two albums are death metal , however they are seriously two of the most bizarre slabs of death metal ever written , and were lightyears ahead of their time .
Combining elements of jazz and grind with death metal , accompanied by loads of asymmetrical rhythms , unorthodox riffing and mind - bending time - signatures , this is some extremely unique stuff .
Augury
Behold ...
The Arctopus
Believer
Beneath The Massacre
Blotted Science
Brain Drill
Butcher ( Bra )
Carcariass
Cebrerum
Cephalic Carnage
Confessor
Coroner
Cosmic Atrophy
Cryptopsy
Cyaegha
Cyclone Temple
Cynic
Death : Chuck Schuldiner 's legendary metal project .
Considered one of the very first death metal bands , along with Possessed , Death evolved to become one of the first technical metal bands starting with the album Spiritual Healing , but really coming into fruition with the album Human .
With the album Individual Though Patterns , Death pushed the boundaries of technicality for its day .
Symbolic is a classic album of progressive metal , but is clearly not as technical as Individual Thought Patterns or Human .
Chuck Schuldiner used influences from progressive rock and jazz to create a truly unique band that is one of the absolute basics when it comes to learning about tech - death , along with Atheist .
Decapitated
Decrepit Birth
Deeds of Flesh
Defeated Sanity
Deivos
Demilich
Depressive Age
Disembarkation
Dying Fetus
Edge of Sanity
Enfold Darkness
Equinox
Esqarial
The Faceless
Forbidden
Forced Entry
Fleshgod Apocalypse
Genetic Wisdom
Gorguts
Gorod
Gorerotted
Gory Blister
Gigan
Hacksaw To The Throat
Hexenhaus
Hideous Deformity
Hour of Penance
Iniquity : A bit more doom - orientated death metal at first , which was clearly inspired by both Bolt Thrower and Autopsy in quite a big way , however as their music progressed , it became more and more technical yet still retaining bone - crushing brutality .
Intruder
Invocator
Jack Slater
Juggernaut
Lecherous Nocturne
Lex Talionis
Lykathea Aflame
Malignancy
Mekong Delta : Experimental and mysterious German thrash metal band .
One of the most progressive thrash bands of the 80s along with Watchtower , Forbidden and Coroner .
Highly reccomended .
They have a very unique riffing style , and fans of odd drumming / metric time signatures will be pleased with quite a few of their songs .
Meshuggah : A progressive post - thrash band known for their constantly shifting time signatures and mind - bending polyrhythms , but often criticized for their monotony and stereotypical " chugging " .
If interested , ' Destroy , Erase , Improve ' and ' Chaosphere ' are classics , but any album in their discography after their debut will give a good idea of their sound .
Monolith Deathcult
Necrophagist :
The controversial brainchild of guitarist Muhammed Suicmez , whom played all the instruments on the first release and almost completely wrote the second release , and one of the most popular death metal bands playing today .
Muhammed is revered by guitarists for his neoclassical soloing and technical ability , but is criticized for his cold and clinical precision .
Draw your own conclusions , but if interested in heavy technical death metal with laser - speed guitar leads and moments of unorthodox riffery , ' Onset of Putrefaction ' and ' Epitaph ' are both essential releases .
Neuraxis
Nile : Very technically influenced death metal band with Egyptian themes .
Through the first few listens they might not sound as technical as some of the other bands on this list , but Karl Sanders has some jaw - dropping lead parts , and every member of the band delivers peak performances for their respective instrument .
Nocturnus : A progressive old school death band featuring a synthesizer and Mike Browning .
The album ' The Key ' features some very technical stuff , and is a death meta classic .
Obliveon
Obscura ( Deu ) : Technical death metal band that recently skyrocketed in popularity when they acquired 2 ex-members of Necrophagist , and the fretless bassist from Pestilence ( Nld ) .
Sometimes criticized for not being ' heavy enough ' , but often hailed for their technical ability , ear for melody , and songwriting skills .
Though their 2009 release ' Cosmogenesis ' received much more press ( deservedly ) , their 2006 album ' Retribution ' ( recorded before acquiring an all - star lineup ) is a tech - death classic .
Odious Mortem
Opeth
Origin : A band that plays super fast , but extremely catchy , tech - death .
Contends with Brain Drill for the fastest of the tech - death bands , but does not suffer from much of the criticism that Brain Drill does , as the emphasis is on the rhythm rather than the lead playing and the songs have a very definite direction and structure .
Highly recommended .
Osiris
Pavor
Pestilence ( Nld ) ( Later )
Psychotic Waltz
Psycroptic
Quo Vadis
Revokation
Rosicrucian
Sceptic
Severed Saviour
Shuriken Cadaveric Entwinement
Sickening Horror
Sleep Terror
Spastic Ink
Spawn of Possession
Spiral Architect
Suffocation : A brutal death metal band whose modern albums , and well as their classic albums , possess a high degree of technicality .
I highly recommend the album ' Pierced from Within ' .
Symbyosis
T3h Shred Boiz : A technical metal parody that has made their album , ' WTF ' , available for free on myspace .
Though obviously intended as a joke ( just take a look at the song names ) , this release possesses a very high degree of technical spirit and a strong sense of melody .
The title track is absolutely fantastic , and the guitarwork and drumming has to be heard to be believed .
The Terrigen Mists
Theory in Practice
Twisted into Form
Ulcerate
Vektor
Viraemia
Visceral Bleeding
Watchtower
Just to clarify - not all of these bands are super wankery soloing bands , but they are the most important bands in the technical metal subgenre , mostly being tech - death .
If anyone has any important bands that I 've missed in mind , let me know .
One last thing :
Willowtip , love 'em or hate 'em , has plenty of good tech death releases out , and always have plenty more lined up .
Check them out .
Special thanks to demisetheflesh , Wizard_AuZ , demisetheflesh , TheExodusAttack , Leechmaster , Wordless_Hon , Jant_Shira , heavyyield , Winterkald , leblebi , Rippingheadache , triggerhappy , Duisterling and 666 _International for suggesting some great bands to add to the list .
Very special thanks to gigi_duru for the list of technical thrash bands !
There needs to be a technical metal help thread .
Every day there are probably 5 new ' progressive / technical metal ' request threads , and they could easily be condensed into a single thread .

We spend a lot of time here at Mashable finding the very best videos that the Internet has to offer .
It 's a tough job wading though hundreds of thousands of videos , but we 're committed to finding the ones we think are truly deserving of your viewing attention .
If you do n't already have plans to see friends , family or take in the great outdoors , then this is the perfect reason to spend the weekend with your computer .
So sit back , relax , and enjoy not just the best , but the best videos on YouTube .
Overview
The Search and Information Extraction Lab ( SIEL ) of Language Technologies Research Centre ( LTRC ) , IIIT Hyderabad is conducting a special and unique event named SONG , from July 12th to 18th 2010 .
SONG is one - of - a - kind event where all the researchers of the lab will be working on a single task which could possibly make difference to the lives of many .
This shall be SIEL 's contribution to the society .
SIEL plans to conduct this event every year and SONG 2010 shall be the first in the series .
SIEL has 40 researchers working on different aspects of Information Retrieval and Extraction .
Using the knowledge of every individual to make a useful system in a week 's time will be a challenging task but will also be a time to see the entire lab work together on one problem for a noble cause .
SIELers will stay in the workplace for an entire week , discuss and enjoy system building .
We seek support from project managers , program managers , rapid application development experts , researchers and media / press to make this event a grand success .
5 things to do to speed up your PC and boot time
1 – Get Windows 8 :
Firstly , measure how many seconds it takes for your Windows to boot and compare to the general benchmarks below .
If you have Windows 7 and it boots at around 38 seconds , that is normal ; if you want faster boot up , then you need to switch to Windows 8 as the boot - up speed is about twice as fast .
Please note that these numbers are for a new computer only .
As you use your computer , boot time will naturally increase ; but you do n’t want it to increase too much and use some tricks to control that as we describe in this article .
2 – Install an SSD :
If you boot - up time is over 1 minute or if you want to bring down you time to as short as possible , best thing you can do is to install a solid state drive .
You can always delete some of the programs or large files to free up your hard disk .
However , this takes time since you have to prioritize your files importance and in the end have to delete some stuff .
3 – Disable most start - up programs :
If you do n’t want to invest in an SSD solid state drive , the faster and more stable way to increase your boot - up speed is to use a start - up helper program that would delay the start of some of the programs .
The program which is not used every time in the computer should be unchecked to stop it from automatically starting .
To complete this process go to ‘ Start ’ and then to ‘ Accessories ’ and select ‘ Run ’ .
Enter .
With ‘ Startup ’ tab find out the desired program from the list , uncheck it and click ’ OK ’ .
Also clear the undesired desktop shortcuts because more the shortcuts on the desktop , more time the computer takes up to load and start .
Some software programs enable you to manage you start - up easily .
A good registry program ( see below ) would have a feature to manage your start - up programs .
I would disable all programs except the ones related to Windows / Systems , audio and wi-fi and install Windows Security Center instead of AVG or McAfee .
Windows Security is light on your computer processing power and is as effective as others if not more , so you can get some boost in boot time using that program instead of others .
4 – Delete / transfer unused programs and large files :
Important step to increase the performance of PC is to uninstall unused programs .
To do that use the built - in ‘ Uninstall ’ feature by going to ‘ Control Panel ’ through ‘ Start Menu ’ and right clicking the desired program .
Also , delete large files not frequently used from the hard drive .
It is advisable to keep such files in an external drive or cloud storage .
5 – Use a registry cleaner :
You should clean out invalid keys , repair broken shortcuts and remove other unnecessary and cluttered files from your computer registry .
These unorganized registry files prevent applications to access keys smoothly and consume your PC ’s memory , which slows your computer boot - up time and overall operations .
You should repair your registry files by running an efficient registry cleaner and performance booster such as Regcure Pro

27 July 2010 SEA Desalination Corporation Mike Wofsey writes 27 July 2010 : I read your excellent interview in CNET , I looked for it because I trust people but not organizations so much , and WikiLeaks seemed a bit fishy to me from the get - go .
But something strange happened while I was looking at the article , I noticed the photo .
By some twist of coincidence , I happened to be wearing the very same blue plaid shirt with the open collar that you are wearing in the pix , and just a few hours earlier my wife was complaining that I need to throw it out .
Then I looked at the photo and saw that you were standing in front of 2 Penn Plaza , the building in which I used to work when I worked at McGraw Hill .
Then I looked at your photo more carefully and I think that I recognized you from years ago , when I was a lifeguard at The Paris Health Club .
( I 'm not positive about the last one , and my mom has an apartment on West 103 , so it might be from there . )
Anyway , it felt like kismet , so I read your interview more carefully than I would normally read such things , and found that at least as presented in that interview ( which might be total b.s. ) you are apparently an honest person .
Mike and Shevi I figured what the hell , I would ask you for help .
I 'm hoping to ask you for a recommendation for someone to help me .
First the background ...
About seven years ago I lived in NYC with my wife and two daughters , down in Battery Park City , we had a decent life , lots of fun , mostly broke , but I had a job at McGraw Hill and I was working on my MA in physics at CUNY on 34th Street .
I figured I had a future back then .
But then our 3 - year - old daughter started getting sick , I reckoned from the concrete dust and asbestos from WTC that was all over our neighborhood , but maybe I 'm just a bit paranoid .
She was hospitalized , but things got better , then McGraw Hill broke my contract and laid me off , so I had no job , but since I had a small at - home business ( http://www.galaxygauge.com/)
I could n't get unemployment insurance .
I was done with the MA , and it seemed like the right time to move to where my mother - in - law was , in Tuscaloosa , Alabama .
( I 'm originally from Colorado . )
I joined the Ph.D. program for physics down here , figuring I would do well when I finished , after all , who has ever heard of an unemployed physicist ?
I studied , failed the qualifier but studied some more and then passed the qualifier , finished my classes , jumped off the theoretical molecular physics track and got into desalination physics , spurred on by the desire to help all the people in the world who were dying of water - related illnesses .
I struggled some more , fought some more , invented some new types of ultra-cheap solar desalination systems that could save lives in developing nations .
Got some decent seed funding to start the company , got a research grant from the EPA , things seemed pretty bright .
Then I struggled some more to finish my Ph.D. , did some ( in my opinion ) kick - ass research on desalination with ion polarization , finally finished my Ph.D. I had no money and a lot of debt , but the future still looked pretty good since I had a company that was manufacturing and marketing my solar desalination inventions .
I was selling a few of them through some modest advertising on the Oracle Broadcasting Network ( my favorite liberty radio station ) .
This was four months ago , the future still looked good .
But now it 's nearly August and everything went south and I 'm asking for help from you .
( I do n't want money , just so you know , but I 'm nearly at the critical point of this email .
As soon as I finished my Ph.D. at U of Alabama , my teaching job in the department stopped too .
Suddenly no income .
And no jobless benefits because of that home business that makes all of $ 50 / week at the moment .
My wife owns a yoga studio , but yoga is a tough sell in the land of football and barbecue , so we 're broke .
But something is wrong with this picture of misery , because I also own the majority of a $ 3 million company ( that 's the value based on the three patents and the revenue return on our advertising . )
Here is the website for the company : http://www.seapanel.com/
And my company just took on a new CEO who used to be CEO of a public - traded environmental engineering company .
We also got a new director on the board who is about one of the coolest quantitative analysts on the planet , etc. .
But the company is flopping in the water , because we have no money to advertise , and thus no way to sell product .
I 'm sure the company will get some VC or angel investing at some point fairly soon , which will probably take another few weeks to show up in the account , but for now , I 'm broke with no salary .
I sometimes wonder if any of the famous entrepreneurs in history went through a time in their life when they saved half of a Hot Pocket for later .
And things are bad .
I have to borrow money to buy food , I sold off all of my 401k and my stocks to pay for rent , I 'm busted , with the looming wall of about $ 150 k in student debt for the Ph.D. .
I 've applied for lots of jobs , but apparently nobody needs a desalination physicist .
( I guess I 'm 10 years too early on that . )
Out of 100 resumes for a variety of positions I got a call - back from G.E. , but it ended there .
I can't even get a job at Radio Shack .
I 'm not clueless in the job hunt either , back when I was younger I landed a science journalist job at The Wall Street Journal .
But maybe I 'm too old now , I 'm not sure .
And then things got harder ... health issues .
Thankfully I switched our health insurance to one that does n't suck , but the year pre-existing condition does n't expire until November , so it 's out - of - pocket until then .
So now , I can't move our family back to NYC even if I wanted to , because our health insurance wo n't transfer .
I 'm considering just moving to NYC and staying in my mom's apartment , and sending money back to support my family , in the style of Pakistani cab drivers .
That might work , since I can always be sure of finding work at least driving a cab , but the horrible thing hanging over my head is that if I do that , I would essentially have to throw away my $ 3 million company , which is essentially worth nothing right now , because I 'm too broke to advertise it .
And I 'm okay doing that if necessary , support for my family comes first , but there is this nagging thing inside of me , that I have an obligation to all the developing nations children of the planet whom I can help save with this invention .
It truly is a remarkable invention ... a 3 lb. chunk of plastic that will make over a gallon of pure distilled drinking water from any water source , including ocean water and contaminated ground water , and all at the low price of $ 25 / child for 4 - 6 year life device , so it comes to the cost of $ 5 / child / year for enough clean water to keep them from dying from diarrhea or cholera .
Surely many people would love to have a such thing ?
Non ?
Probably , but I can't make many sales !
I do n't know if I 'm just having bad luck or if my failure is part of some imbalance in the cosmic luck plane , or just the bad economy , but things are just not working right for some reason .
And I 'm decent at selling things , when I used to have my own small printing company down on Varick Street I sold all sorts of printing , and pulled in plenty of cash .
But now ?
Pfft .
Is it because I 'm in Alabama and not NYC ?
Thus we 're at the end of this miserable tale ... my dear John , you are an architect , undoubtedly at the helm of some key projects .
Do you have any friends or acquaintances to whom you could refer me who might be able to either buy some kick - arse solar desalination systems for Developing Nations ( at a big discount from our retail prices on the website ) .
Or could you recommend me to someone who could evangelize these things to people in a position to be able to buy some ?
I 'm just asking you for some sales leads , if you do n't mind , I 'll even pay you a commission on them .
I 'll run my fingers to the bone manufacturing them , I 'll carry the inventory until delivery , I 'll work hard .
I 'm just hoping for a few sales that can keep me going -- actually rescue me -- until VC or investment comes through .
And ideas ?
Thanks .

Tracking snowclones is hard .
Let 's go shopping !
Michael Kaplan recently offered up a snowclone in need of investigation :
X is hard .
Let 's go shopping !
He was unsure of its origin , but a commenter on his blog wrote :
" Math is hard , let 's go shopping " came from a talking Barbie doll .
Mattel got a lot of heat for that one ( people believed it made the science and math gap between males and females worse ) .
Later models of the Barbie had the phrase deleted .
Well , it 's a bit more complicated than that .
Since talking dolls seem to lend themselves to the embellishments of urban folklore , I thought I 'd track down the origins of this putative Barbie-ism .
It all started in 1992 , when Mattel Inc. rolled out Teen Talk Barbie , the first talking Barbie doll in two decades .
Each Teen Talk Barbie could say four phrases , selected from a total pool of 270 randomly programmed sayings .
The doll was unveiled at the American International Toy Fair in February of ' 92 with great fanfare .
The Washington Post reported on the unveiling with barely concealed sarcasm :
So here we are - a curtain rises , a stage appears and it's TEEN TALK BARBIE !
" You look great ! " Barbie says .
" Want to go shopping ?
Okay , meet me at the mall . "
A thin , leggy blond woman ( one of scores of such creatures brought in for the fair ) introduces the chatty new doll and all her new clothing .
The woman , with her hair and enthusiasm , is Barbie .
She is holding a Barbie .
The two Barbies are having a conversation , except the doll is doing most of the talking .
" Let 's have a campfire ! " says the doll .
" We could take a Hawaiian vacation !
Would n't you love to be a lifeguard ? "
The doll began to be sold to the general public in July , and on Sep. 25 the Wall Street Journal broke the news of some serious objections about one of Teen Talk Barbie 's utterances :
Barbie is a troublemaker .
The latest incarnation of the popular doll is posing a bit of a marketing problem for maker Mattel .
Specifically , the Teen Talk Barbie Doll quips ( among other remarks ) that " Math class is tough . "
That has angered some women educators , who say they are already fighting to sustain schoolgirls ' interest in math and science .
" If Barbie gives the message that math is tough , Barbie could be turning off girls to math and science , and that 's a mistake , " says Anne Bryant , executive director of the American Association of University Women , a research group that issued a report this year titled , " How Schools Shortchange Girls . "
The report found that , although girls and boys both do well in math prior to sixth grade , boys are more likely to score better and take higher - level courses after that time .
Judy Blitch , chairwoman of the education department at Wesleyan College for women in Macon , Ga. , says she and a dozen students called Mattel 's 800 number to protest .
" We were concerned , " says Prof .
Blitch , who bought the doll for her five - year - old daughter .
" We need to do whatever we can to encourage girls in that area .
Barbie represents an important part of girls ' lives and can influence thinking . "
But Mattel mailed Prof .
Blitch a reply that did n't address the issue .
It does n't plan to change the doll , which sells for about $ 25 and says four phrases .
There are 270 sayings randomly programmed into different dolls , such as " Let 's have a beach party " and " Do n't be late for school . "
Says a spokeswoman : " I do n't think math was chosen because it 's more or less difficult .
You can also get a doll that says , ' I 'm studying to be a doctor . ' "
Once the story was picked up by news outlets nationwide , however , Mattel soon caved in to public pressure .
As the New York Times reported on Oct. 21 , Mattel decided to alter the computer chip in Teen Talk Barbie to remove " Math class is tough " from the programmed selection of sayings .
So Barbie did talk vacuously about the difficulty of math ( " Math class is tough " ) and the fun of shopping ( " Want to go shopping ?
Okay , meet me at the mall " ) , but she never put the two sentiments together in one utterance .
( I do n't know if she ever said the exact words " Let 's go shopping , " either .
More likely that was a confusion with another toy marketed to girls in the early '90s : the Pressman Toy Corporation 's board game , " Let 's Go Shopping . " )
That might have been the end of things , but around Christmastime of 1993 came word of a shadowy organization known as the Barbie Liberation Organization , dedicated to switching computer chips between Teen Talk Barbie and her gender - stereotype opposite , Talking Duke G.I. Joe .
( More about the BLO here , though the page inaccurately dates its founding to 1989 . )
The New York Times detailed the BLO 's activities in a Dec. 31 , 1993 article :
Your son tears the wrapping paper off his fierce new " Talking Duke " G. I .
Joe doll and eagerly presses the talk button .
Out comes a painfully chirpy voice that sounds astonishingly like Barbie 's saying , " Let 's go shopping ! "
Does your son :
A ) Furiously vaporize the doll with his own phaser rifle ?
B ) Go shopping with Joe ?
C ) Say : " Mom , I suspect we 're the lucky victims of an elaborate nationwide publicity stunt designed to ridicule sexual stereotyping in children 's toys .
This barbaric little action figure you gave me may turn out to be a valuable collector 's item . "
If the answer is C , your son may be a collector 's item himself , for he has correctly divined the latest socially conscious news media prank to hit the nation 's toy stores .
For the last several months , a group of performance artists based in the East Village of Manhattan has been buying Talking Dukes and " Teen Talk " Barbies , which cost $ 40 to $ 50 each , painstakingly swapping their voice boxes and then , with the aid of cohorts , replacing dolls on the shelves of toy stores in at least two states .
The group , which asserts it has surgically altered 300 dolls , says its aim is to startle the public into thinking about the Stone Age - world view that the dolls reflect .
The result is a mutant colony of Barbies - on - steroids who roar things like " Attack ! " " Vengeance is mine ! " and " Eat lead , Cobra ! "
The emasculated G. I . Joe 's , meanwhile , twitter , " Will we ever have enough clothes ? " and " Let 's plan our dream wedding ! "
Publicity for the BLO 's campaign of doll terror thrust Teen Talk Barbie back into the news and also resurrected the " Math class is tough " controversy from the previous year .
Further proof that Teen Talk Barbie 's inanities had struck a chord in the pop-culture consciousness came when The Simpsons aired an episode on Feb. 17 , 1994 titled " Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy . "
In the episode eight - year - old Lisa launches a campaign against Barbie - esque Malibu Stacy when a talking version of the doll is released .
Here are some of the things Malibu Stacy says ( thanks to The Simpsons Archive ) :
I wish they taught shopping in school .
Let 's bake some cookies for the boys !
Do n't ask me ; I 'm just a girl < giggle > < giggle > .
Now let 's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream .
Thinking too much gives you wrinkles .
My name is Stacy , but you can call me < two - note wolf whistle > .
A few months later , the canonical form of the pseudo - Barbie - ism " Math is hard , let 's go shopping " finally showed up in Usenet discussion , when Nick Fitch used it on May 27 , 1994 in the gay and lesbian newsgroup soc.motss .
But it took another couple of years for the expression to be snowcloned by Usenetters .
The earliest example I 've found is in a Jan. 30 , 1996 post on alt.college.college- bowl
( " College Bowl is hard ... let 's go shopping ! " ) .
On Apr. 25 of that year , one contributor to soc.women.lesbian - and - bi who was stuck on a particular bit of phrasing made the tongue - and - cheek comment , " Language is hard .
Let 's go shopping . "
( Another contributor responded , " Shopping is hard .
Let 's go water skiing . " )
But 1997 was when the snowclone started to achieve popularity on Usenet , particularly on soc.motss where it became an in - joke for some of the regulars ( among the items placed in the snowclone slot that year were " lit crit , " " sociology and metaphysics , " " situational ethics , " and " sacrifice " ) .
It would n't take long for the snowclone to move beyond newsgroups like soc.motss and into wider online usage .
Nowadays just about anything can fill the slot of " math , " from property to navigation to democracy to development theory to the programming language LISP .
Michael Kaplan 's post that set off this investigation stuck address formats in the slot .
And the fact that Kaplan used it without being quite sure of its origins suggests that the snowclone has moved into a new phase , where the template can spread without being considered a direct allusion to something .
Rather , use of the snowclone can now simply allude to other instances of the snowclone .
How very meta .
[ Update , 3/11/06 : Barbie 's thoughts on math and shopping also cropped up in a mid-'90s video game .
