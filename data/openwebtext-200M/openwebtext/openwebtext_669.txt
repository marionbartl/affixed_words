Cheney endorses His buddy McBush
Dick Cheney emerges from his bunker to help out his old pal , John McBush pretends like they were never clowns in the same circus ,
Obama ’s really more like Cheney than McCain , they argued , and referenced something Obama used to joke about , the discovery that Obama ’s and Cheney ’s family trees are distantly linked .
“ Barack Obama and Dick Cheney are n’t just cousins , they ’ve shared support for the Bush energy policy and the out - of - control spending that John McCain has fought to oppose , ” said the response from McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds
We ’ve been down this road countless times .
McCain voted with Bush the vast majority of the time .
Absurdly some McCain supporters are trying to make the case that since Bush signed off the three bills that Obama got enacted , Obama thus voted with Bush 100 % of the time .
Since its beyond doubt that Obama never sponsored a bill pushed by the opposition party ’s administration , its more like Bush approved of Obama ’s bills 100 % of the time .
Part of Senator Obama ’s reply ,
I ’d like to congratulate Senator McCain on this endorsement because he really earned it .
That endorsement did n’t come easy .
Senator McCain had to vote 90 percent of the time with George Bush and Dick Cheney to get it .
He served as Washington ’s biggest cheerleader for going to war in Iraq , and supports economic policies that are no different from the last eight years .
So Senator McCain worked hard to get Dick Cheney ’s support .
But here ’s my question for you , Colorado : do you think Dick Cheney is delighted to support John McCain because he thinks John McCain ’s going to bring change ?
Do you think John McCain and Dick Cheney have been talking about how to shake things up , and get rid of the lobbyists and the old boys club in Washington ?
Glenn Greenwald takes a look at the Right ’s upper escalon pundits and their attempts to portray Senator Obama as a Muslim without actually saying the M word .
Which in today ’s political climate is the same as trying to otherize Obama .
This came on the heels of one of the tough - guy Powerline warriors deciding ( with National Review cheering ) that the politician to whom Obama bears the closest substantive resemblance is Rep. Keith Ellison , an African - American who is also the first Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress .
This tactic is more pathetically desperate than it is anything else — it has n’t worked yet and is n’t likely to
Maybe it is working with some low information voters – Barack Obama warns of last ditch ‘ dirty tricks campaign ’ to scare away supporters – on the other hand the Right might have reached its smear saturation point .
Everyone that wants to believe Obama is whatever – fill in the blank – they are not going to convert anyone new to their flat earth - like theories at this point .
One of the Conservative anti-Obama messages floating around the net is that Obama ca n’t get a security clearance because of his alleged radical associations .
I guess that Bush and Cheney are in on the plot to cover up Obama ’s Manchurian status , Obama receiving intel briefings
Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell told a public symposium in Nashville on Oct. 30 that the intelligence briefings for Sens. John McCain , R - AZ , and Barack Obama , D - Ill , have been part of an official transition process approved by the Bush administration that has also included briefings for their campaigns .
Should Senator Obama be declared president elect in a couple of days – which seems likely , Senator Obama will start to get excatly the same high level President ’s Daily Briefing that Bush gets everyday .
Has n’t Bush heard that Obama has a fake birth certiftcate and pals around with terrorists .

Latest GOP smear plot revealed : Professor paid to try to tie Ayers to Obama biography
The brother of a Republican congressman and a Republican businessman attempted to pay an professor in Oxford to use software he designed to “ prove ” that 1960s radical William Ayers helped write Sen.
Barack Obama ’s biography .
The professor , Dr. Peter Millican , teaches philosophy at Hertford College , Oxford .
His software is designed to detect when works are by the same authors by comparing the use of similar words and phrases .
The offer was revealed Sunday in a British newspaper .
“ He was entirely upfront about this , ” the professor said of the Republican businessman ( Robert Fox , a California GOP businessman ) who made the offer .
“ He offered me $ 10,000 and sent me electronic versions of the text from both books . ”
Millican said he took a preliminary look and found the charges that Ayers had had a hand in ghostwriting Obama ’s book “ very implausible . ”
A deal was agreed for “ more detailed research , ” the paper said , but when Millican “ said the results had to be made public , even if no link to Ayers was proved , interest waned . ”
The Republicans sought to allege similarities between Obama ’s Dreams of My Father and Ayers ’ Fugitive Days .
Que the Two Stooges , The GOP businessman Robert Fox is now trying to lay blame on his brother - in - law , Rep. Chris Cannon ( R - UT ) who in turn is saying it was all Fox ’s idea .
McCain ’s campaign manager claims the race is n’t close .
Nope McBush has made a comeback that will make the history books , John McCain : The Comeback Very Old Kid
“ We believe , with the combination of our base states and the states we ’ve been able to put into play this week , we can achieve 270 . ”
McCain would have to win every non-decided voter plus a few Democrats to win .
He has a 2.8 % chance of winning .
I think , or hope this comment at the link is satire ,
Obama ’s use of hypnosis in speeches is why :
- nothing sticks to him
- the huge crowds
- the huge money contributions
- the mesmerized effect , especially in young people , who , because of their imaginations are more susceptible to hypnosis ( read the document )
- the exorbitant election fraud , rule - breaking and bias in the media
-he gets away with changing every position
- people are calling him the “ greatest leader of a generation ” with no accomplishments
You have to read this document to understand how his hypnosis works .
Logically and rationally , why not get to know this guy a little more before handing the world over to him ?
Why not wait ?
The Mass Hypnosis Axiom .
In the Netherland of Wingnuttia that probably does warrant further research .
Notice that in keeping with the Axiom , Conservative tin-foil hats with the fold down visors would make them imperious to the Mass Hypnosis .

Kossacks - just a quick note to let you know that right now , Daily Kos sister - site Street Prophets is hosting a conversation between WaPo columnist EJ Dionne and Harvard theologian Harvey Cox on the Future of Faith , and the role of faith in the progressive movement .
Todd Gitlin is moderating the conversation , which is being streamed live from New York City .
EJ Dionne and Professor Cox will be taking questions from the online audience .
Head on over to Street Prophets if you would like to participate .
In light of the recent debate brought up by the Stupak Amendment , this looks to be a timely discussion .
More details on the event below the jump .
Months of tension between Republican Sen. Norm Coleman and his Democratic rival , Al Franken , burst into open acrimony during the last debate of the campaign Sunday night as they traded heated accusations about allegations made in a lawsuit against the incumbent .
It started immediately , and Coleman denied taking money or gifts from supporters without disclosing it .
That charge stems from sworn statements in a lawsuit filed last week in Texas claiming Coleman ’s friend and donor Nasser Kazeminy funneled $ 75,000 to a business that employs Coleman ’s wife in order to enrich the senator .
“ The answer is no , ” Coleman said when asked whether the allegations were true .
He then swung back to his charge that Franken was responsible for a TV ad about the allegations , which shows a clip of reporters asking Coleman about the alleged payments to his wife ’s employer -- and which the senator said defames her .
Franken ’s campaign is n’t running the ad , which is paid for by Democrats in Washington .

“ You have an ad that ’s defaming my wife , ” Coleman said .
“ I think there ’s a line in this business .
You can take any shot you want at the candidate .
Mr. Franken , rather than rejecting it , is promoting it . ”
Franken replied that Coleman must answer questions about the allegations -- and rejected the idea that discussion of it is an attack on Laurie Coleman .
“ This is not about Norm Coleman ’s wife , ” Franken said .
“ This is about Sen. Coleman ’s sugar daddy . ”
But that did n’t end the recriminations .
For the first time in five debates , Coleman criticized Franken on an issue other Republicans hammered for months -- that statements and writings in his careers as a comedian and writer betrayed an angry sensibility unsuited to the Senate .
“ I think folks have a right to look at the character , to look at the record , ” Coleman said .
“ Jokes about rape , is that a line ?
Writing pornography for Playboy , is that a line ?
Calling a Supreme Court justice sexist , is that a line ? ”

The sniping left a wide opening for the third candidate at the debate , the Independence Party ’s Dean Barkley , who is gaining in the polls .
He presented his candidacy as an alternative for voters tired of what he called “ the most negative campaign in Minnesota ’s history . ”
“ I ask people , do you think either Al or Norm will change the way Washington works ? ” Barkley said .
“ That ’s a question you have to ask yourself . ”
On the issues , Franken said his main goal would be “ getting the economy back on track . ”
Coleman said he wanted to be a part of changing the divisive tone in Washington and accomplishing common goals .
Barkley emphasized the need to rein in spending .
He said that in each of his past runs for office , dating to 1992 , he has warned of the dangers of a spiraling deficit .
But the Colombians – who have since vanished – attacked the wrong horses by mistake , the paper said .
On the day of the crime , Sergio Galan and the Domecq brothers , Luis and Antonio , had taken part in a bullfight in Madrid and when each party set off for home with their horses in trailers , the Colombian hitmen chose the wrong lorry .
SENIOR Republicans believe that Senator John McCain is doomed to a landslide defeat that will hand Barack Obama more political power than any president in a generation .
The prospect of an electoral rout has unleashed bitter recriminations both within the McCain campaign and the wider conservative movement .
Senator McCain is facing calls to sacrifice his own dwindling hopes and focus on saving vulnerable Republican Senate seats .
The fear is that Democratic candidates riding on Senator Obama 's popularity may win the nine extra seats they need in the Senate to give them unfettered power in Congress .
If the Democratic majority is big enough - at least 60 seats to 40 - Republicans would be unable to block legislation .
No president has had the support of such a majority since Jimmy Carter won the 1976 election .
Former Bush speechwriter David Frum said Republicans should concentrate all their fire on " the need for balanced government " .
" This could look like an ideological as well as a party victory if we 're not careful , " he said .
" It could be 1980 in reverse .
With this huge new role for federal government in the economy , the possibility for mischief - making is very , very great . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Troubled insurer American International Group got a reworked $ 152.5 billion deal from the federal government Monday , as the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department made significant changes to the terms of the company 's original bailout .
The Fed announced that it will reduce AIG 's original $ 85 billion bridge loan to $ 60 billion , cut the interest rate by 5.5 percentage points and extend the borrowing period to five years from two years .
In addition , the Treasury will use its special authority under last month 's $ 700 billion bailout law - the so - called Troubled Asset Relief Program - to purchase $ 40 billion in preferred stock .
The new bailout was worked out between government officials and AIG executives over the weekend .
AIG was having difficulty paying back its original bridge loan , which it intended to use to sell off many of its subsidiaries to restore the company to a stable condition .
" This is definitely what AIG needed in the sense that it got rid of the first deal , " said Donald Light , senior analyst with Celent .
" This one is more tailored to the actual issues affecting the company and has a much better chance of getting AIG the help it needs . "
Shares of AIG jumped on the news , finishing the day 8 % higher at $ 2.28 a share .
But shares fallen about 90 % since the company received its first bailout in mid-September .
The credit crisis has proven to be a difficult environment to spin off assets .
Furthermore , the company 's investors continued to demand that the insurer post collateral to back its credit default swap agreements - essentially insurance contracts that AIG had sold to customers worldwide - forcing AIG to borrow more and more from the government .
As the company drew down billions , the high interest rate on the original loan became too punitive .
" The Treasury determined AIG was a systemically significant institution , " a Treasury official said .
" Bringing more equity to the company puts AIG in a better position to dispose of its assets , and it was done to protect the taxpayer . "
Trying to stop the bleeding
The Fed is also creating two new entities designed to stanch the bleeding in two of the company 's divisions that are threatening to topple the insurer .
First , to shore up the insurer 's shaky securities lending business , the Federal Reserve of New York will inject $ 22.5 billion and AIG $ 1 billion into an entity that will purchase $ 23.5 billion of residential mortgage - backed securities .
This will take the place of a $ 37.8 billion lending facility made available to AIG last month .
In this division , AIG lent securities to others for a fee and invested the money elsewhere -- much of it in mortgage - backed securities -- hoping for a gain .
But it ran into trouble after the mortgage - backed securities declined in value , leaving AIG unable to unwind the loans as the deals expire .
AIG said this is the major reason for its recent liquidity issues .
The second entity announced Monday seeks to address the source of the original problems that nearly brought AIG down in mid-September .
Funded with $ 30 billion from the New York Fed and $ 5 billion from AIG , it will purchase up to $ 70 billion of multi-sector collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs , on which AIG 's financial products division wrote credit default swaps .
As the value of these CDOs plummeted , AIG was forced to post more collateral to back up the swaps .
Some 95 % of the division 's writedowns originate from these multi-sector CDOs .
Once this entity is funded , the credit default swaps on these CDOs will be terminated .
This is aimed at stopping the collateral calls that have been overwhelming the insurer .
Analysts speaking on a conference call pressed the company on whether it could convince CDO holders to sell them at 50 cents on the dollar .
Executives said the Federal Reserve will drive negotiations and expects them to succeed .
" We cannot continue to hemorrhage cash in posting collateral for credit default swaps , " said AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy .
" We need to stop that , and we need to stop that now . "
Andrew Barile , an insurance consultant at Andrew Barile Consulting Corp. , said the bailout will help ease AIG 's need to continue to post more collateral .
But he said the company will continue to have trouble selling off its subsidiaries .
In the current environment , other smaller companies may rather pluck talent away from AIG than assume its unwanted companies .
" People also underestimate the time it takes to sell off assets of an insurance company , which takes months and months , " said Barile .
Also on Monday , AIG reported its biggest quarterly loss ever : $ 24.5 billion , or $ 9.05 per share , in the third quarter .
Excluding one - time charges , AIG lost $ 9.2 billion , or $ 3.42 per share , in the three months ended Sept.
8 . That compares to a gain of $ 1.35 per share during the same period a year earlier .
Liddy attributed the poor results to " extreme dislocations and volatility in the capital markets " during the quarter .
Insurance on properties destroyed by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike contributed to $ 1.4 billion of losses for the company .
The giant insurer , which has more than 100,000 employees worldwide , reported revenue of $ 11.7 billion , down 0.8 % from $ 11.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007 .
But in an encouraging sign , ratings agency Fitch said it removed the company from its so - called credit watch list immediately following AIG 's announcement , saying the move is important in promoting global financial stability .
Another turnabout for rescue efforts
The new bailout marks a stunning turn in the Bush administration 's efforts to address the escalating financial crisis .
It is likely to stoke calls from those advocating federal rescue plans for other troubled companies such as automaker General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , which said Friday it was running dangerously low on cash .
" Clearly there are other industries interested in accessing TARP ( Troubled Asset Relief Program ) funds , and the Treasury will continue to work on a strategy that will most effectively deploy the remaining funds , " a Treasury official said Monday .
Many taxpayers have expressed anger at the government 's bailout , saying it rewards risky and unscrupulous behavior of corporations .
But Liddy said taxpayers have much to benefit from an equity stake in AIG .
" It is not exactly a bailout , because the American taxpayer will and has been offered considerable returns due to their equity stake in AIG , " Liddy said .
" This plan is a win - win : When things get better , the government will do well , and AIG will do well . "
The Treasury said its $ 40 billion capital injection into AIG is not part of the $ 250 billion that was set aside for equity purchase of banks .
Rather , the funds came from an additional $ 100 billion that President Bush requested .
The transaction 's " one-off " status allowed the government to impose more stringent criteria on executive compensation than on banks receiving Treasury assistance .
As part of the new deal announced Monday , Treasury will limit " golden parachutes " and freeze the size of the annual bonus pool for the top 70 company execs .
Most banks participating in the Treasury program face compensation curbs on only their top five executives .
AIG has come under fire from lawmakers and state officials for seeking to make big payouts to former executives and planning pricey corporate events after receiving the federal loans .
In mid-September , AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) teetered on collapse , pressured by the effects of the credit crisis .
Worried that the company 's failure would domino through the rest of the financial system , the government provided an $ 85 billion bridge loan .
Later , the Fed gave the insurer $ 37.8 billion line of credit , and made available $ 20.9 billion in a debt purchasing facility .
Under the new plan , AIG has borrowed the full $ 40 billion from the Treasury to pay off the $ 37.8 billion from the Fed .
It has drawn down $ 15.3 billion of the $ 20.9 billion it can borrow from the Fed 's Commercial Paper Funding Facility , and it has already borrowed $ 21 billion of its reduced $ 60 billion bridge loan .
The rate on the bridge loan was reduced to 3 percentage points over 3 - month Libor from 8.5 points over Libor - currently 5.24 % , compared to 10.74 % .
On the unused portion , AIG now has to pay 0.75 % interest , down from 8.5 % in the original deal .
" The original bailout was just too onerous for the timing and the cycle , " said Barile .
Liddy , who was installed as CEO after the government 's September rescue , attempted Monday to quell fears that the company was rapidly losing business .
He said that AIG remains " well - capitalized and disciplined in insurance writing , " and it continues to hold on to the vast majority of its clients - losing just 10 % of its insurance business .
But Barile said given the vast size of AIG , that 10 % is a huge amount of lost business , and customers will likely continue to leave AIG when their policies expire .
" With Fortune 500 companies set to renew their insurance policies on Jan. 1 , it will be a real test to see small the company can get , " he said .

Meet Your New Governor Seven Reasons to Fear Dino Rossi
Rich Kelly
Things are looking grim for Christine Gregoire .
On Friday , September 26 , a King County Superior Court judge ruled against the state Democratic Party , which had sought to force Dino Rossi to identify himself as a Republican on the November ballot .
Instead , Rossi will be listed as " Dino Rossi , Prefers GOP Party . "
The distinction is more than just semantic ; in June , a survey by pollster Stuart Elway revealed that fully 25 percent of likely voters did n't know that " GOP " meant Republican and that 7 percent thought it referred to the Democratic Party .
Calling himself a member of the " GOP Party " boosts Rossi 's poll numbers by around 3 percent — a substantial margin in a race that , last time around , was decided by just 133 votes .
In the years since she eked out that victory in 2004 , Gregoire has been a cautious governor in the Gary Locke mold — taking solidly progressive positions on safe - bet Democratic issues like stem - cell research and global warming , but hedging her bets on shakier ground like gay marriage and the fate of the Alaskan Way Viaduct .
Gregoire is tough , but she comes across as brittle under pressure — unlike Rossi , whose dodges are so artful you hardly notice when he fails to answer a question .
In last week 's debate , for example , Rossi dodged a question about Gregoire 's budget with a story about his daughter " little Jillian , " and couched a call for reducing workers ' compensation in an anecdote about starting out in business with " $ 200 in the bank and a $ 200 car and nowhere to go but up . "
Perhaps more importantly , Rossi is proving himself to be a far more robust , adaptive , and compelling candidate than the Rossi of 2004 .
Dino 2.0 is as smooth and soothing as a shot of Ovaltine , in stark contrast to his slick real - estate - huckster persona four years ago .
Despite winning statewide election four times — three times as attorney general , in addition to her narrow 2004 win— Gregoire has always had trouble connecting with voters on a personal level and motivating Democratic voters to turn out for her .
Although Washington State went heavily for John Kerry in 2004 , hundreds of thousands of Democratic voters failed to support Gregoire , leading to two recounts and Gregoire 's subsequent razor - thin margin of victory .
Could history repeat itself — this time , putting Rossi in the governor 's mansion ?
While Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama ( whom Gregoire , presciently , endorsed in early February ) is polling well ahead of his Republican opponent , John McCain , in Washington State ( according to one recent poll , Obama 's lead has widened to 11 points ) , Gregoire and Rossi remain locked in a statistical dead heat .
One recent poll had Rossi leading Gregoire , 49 to 48 percent ; another had Gregoire leading , 50 to 48 .
In the August 19 primary election , with 10 candidates on the ballot , she beat Rossi by less than 2 percent .
All of that could be a sign that a significant number of voters plan to vote for Obama and skip the down - ticket races , or that there are lots of voters who , for whatever reason , are backing a Democrat to lead the nation — and a Republican , with exactly the opposite values , to lead the state .
So what if Rossi wins — should we worry ?
Hell , yes .
Here are a few reasons why .
1 : Your Body , His Choice .
When it comes to abortion rights , Rossi has one response : " I 'm not running on that issue . "
That 's cool .
John McCain probably is n't running on the issue of whether his vice - presidential candidate is an idiot , either .
In any case , voters need to know that Rossi supports additional restrictions on abortion rights , up to supporting a ban on abortion with exceptions for rape , incest , and to save a woman 's life — which puts him just a hair to the left of Sarah Palin .
In 1991 , Rossi campaigned against Initiative 120 , a measure that guarantees a woman 's right to abortion in Washington State .
In 2000 , he addressed a " right to life " rally in Olympia , where he memorialized " the deaths of 38 million preborn babies nationally . "
If any abortion - related legislation came before him as governor , he has said , " I 'll vote [ sic ] my conscience " — not the Constitution .
No , Dino Rossi can't overturn Roe v. Wade .
But he can push for legislation restricting abortion rights and limiting the circumstances in which the state covers abortion care for low - income women .
And he can make sure that , once they 're born , unwanted children have as little chance in life as possible .
In fact , he already has .
In 1999 , then–state senator Rossi voted against creating the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) , which insures low - income kids .
In 2003 , the budget he wrote removed 46,000 children from the program .
And just last year , he supported George W. Bush 's veto of the SCHIP bill , which would have extended health - care benefits to 10 million children .
Rossi may not be " running on that issue " now , but he knows as well as any ambitious politician that governor 's mansions are frequently springboards to higher office .
In 10 years , Governor Rossi may be Congressman Rossi or Health and Human Services Secretary Rossi .
You can bet he wo n't be saying he " is n't running on " the issue of reproductive freedom then .
2 : Good - bye to Any Reproductive Choice at All .
Rossi does n't just oppose abortion rights .
He opposes all reproductive rights — from students ' right to learn the facts about pregnancy , STDs , and birth control , to women 's right to buy contraceptives with a prescription .
Rossi opposes requiring pharmacies to stock emergency contraception , which works by preventing fertilization , because some pharmacists assert , falsely , that it causes abortions .
How trivial does Rossi consider women 's right to emergency contraception ?
On one occasion , he compared requiring pharmacies to dispense the medication to " forcing Safeway to carry my favorite brand of sport drink " ; on another , he likened it to forcing hardware - store owners to carry " certain types of tools . "
And in the late 1990s , as a state senator , Rossi voted against requiring prescription drug plans to cover regular oral contraceptives .
Gregoire , in contrast , believes that dispensing legally prescribed medications is part of a pharmacist 's job description — and that if a drug plan pays for boner pills for men , it ought to pay for contraception for women .
3 : The Company He Keeps .
Rossi's two biggest supporters are the Building Industry Association of Washington ( BIAW ) and the Republican Governor 's Association ( RGA ) , which have spent millions in direct and indirect contributions to Rossi 's campaign .
( The state Public Disclosure Commission just ruled that the BIAW failed to properly report contributions it directed to Rossi 's campaign . )
Although the BIAW 's handiwork is largely invisible in Seattle , the group has funded billboards across Eastern Washington urging voters , " Do n't Let Seattle Steal This Election " — a reference to the two recounts in 2004 's Rossi -Gregoire matchup .
The RGA , meanwhile , has been running misleading ( and arguably racist ) ads portraying Gregoire as a corrupt tool of Native - American tribes — represented , in the ad , by two long - haired men in braided pigtails and bolo ties .
The ad does not note that the Republican Governors Association is itself heavily funded by gambling interests — in the RGA 's case , Las Vegas casinos , which have given the group a cool $ 1.6 million .
In addition to accusing Gregoire , falsely , of " stealing " the 2004 election , BIAW has likened environmentalists to " Hitler 's Nazi Party " ; referred to the Department of Ecology as " communistic " ; declared that Gregoire was a " heartless , power - hungry she - wolf who would eat her own young to get ahead " ; and referred to Gregoire 's supporters as " witches . "
( All quotes are from the BIAW 's official newsletter . )
On policy issues , the BIAW has bragged that , as a state senator , Rossi voted with the organization 99 percent of the time .
Those votes include efforts to block legislation regulating greenhouse - gas emissions , to weaken the Growth Management Act , and to weaken home - owner protections against negligent contractors .
Rossi supports the BIAW 's legislative agenda — hardly surprising coming from someone who has said there is " still a lot of debate " about whether humans are causing global warming .
And speaking of making the environment worse ...
4 : More Roads , No Transit .
Rossi's transportation " choices " plan can be summed up in four words : more roads , no transit .
Not only would Rossi 's proposal build road projects — like a tunnel on Seattle 's waterfront — that voters have already rejected , it would leech $ 800 million a year from the state 's general fund , which pays for education , health care , and prisons .
Although Rossi says he 'll pay for his entire plan by cutting from other spending and charging tolls of $ 1.50 on a new SR 520 bridge , that 's hardly a credible claim in a year when the state faces a $ 3.2 billion budget deficit thanks to a tanking national economy .
And that 's assuming Rossi 's wildly optimistic cost estimates prove accurate — unlikely , as Rossi 's numbers have been denounced as laughable by transportation experts around the state .
For example , Rossi estimates that building a new 520 bridge with pontoons to accommodate eight lanes would cost $ 3.3 billion , or less than a proposed six - lane 520 bridge replacement .
Rossi came up with that number by taking Gregoire 's estimate for a six - lane bridge and just assuming construction would happen faster .
Rossi also predicts that a cut- and - cover tunnel to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct — identical to the so - called " surface / hybrid " tunnel proposed by Seattle mayor Greg Nickels in early 2007 — would cost just $ 2.7 billion .
That 's $ 700 million less than Nickels 's own estimate , which was widely regarded as optimistic .
The rest of his estimates are similarly lowballed — from expanding U.S. Highway 2 ( down to $ 600 million in Rossi 's plan , from as much as $ 1.8 billion in the state 's own estimate ) to extending SR 167 ( down , in Rossi 's plan , to $ 1 billion — just half of the state 's own estimate ) .
Rossi's plan includes no explanation of why he would be able to build road projects so much more cheaply than anybody else .
In Rossi 's campaign literature and during the gubernatorial debates , the Republican candidate has frequently brought up the " green " aspects of his road - building program — like converting the state vehicle fleet to hybrids and plug-ins , getting rid of the sales tax on high - mileage cars , and fixing culverts that block salmon runs .
The problem with those proposals ( in addition to the fact that Rossi , again , lowballs their cost , estimating that $ 200 million will be enough to clear nearly 1,700 culverts for salmon , when the state 's own estimates are four times higher ) is that the $ 767 million Rossi proposes spending on " green " initiatives is n't enough to make up for the billions he wants to spend expanding roads .
As for the claim that his transportation plan provides voters with " choices , " Rossi 's plan provides just one : roads for single - occupancy vehicles .
His plan would not only fund roads to the exclusion of all other forms of transportation , it would effectively kill Sound Transit ( handing transit governance over to a new regional transportation authority , which would also oversee roads ) and eliminate funding for light rail to Bellevue .
Under Rossi's plan ( and a Tim Eyman–backed initiative that is likely to pass in November ) , HOV lanes would be open to traffic during all but a few " peak " hours in the morning and afternoon — condemning bus riders , as well as people who carpool to work , to sit in the same crappy traffic jams as everyone else .
5 : Oh , and About Those " Choices " ...
So let 's say you live in Eastern Washington .
You hate Seattle and its communistic transit ; you are n't taking some faggoty bus to get from Walla Walla to Ephrata or whatever .
You 're celebrating freedom — the freedom to drive !
And Dino Rossi is going to make it easier for you — right ?
Sorry , Bubba .
The state Dems crunched Rossi 's numbers and found that his transportation " choices " plan is actually a giant handout to the Puget Sound .
The proposal would spend just $ 2.3 billion , or 15 percent of the total , east of the mountains — a sum that would be divvied up between just eight projects .
Take out the north - south freeway in Spokane , and that goes down to $ 129 million — an average of less than $ 20 million per project .
Fourteen Eastern Washington counties would receive no money at all .
Rossi's plan , in other words , would divert money from Eastern Washington to pay for road projects on this side of the mountains — where voters rejected a roads - heavy transportation plan just last November .
6 : Rossi " Is n't Running On " Gay Rights , Either — But He Opposes Them .
Let 's be clear : Christine Gregoire , like Barack Obama ( and pretty much every Democrat running for a high - profile office in America right now ) , has said she supports civil unions but thinks Washington State " is n't ready " for gay marriage .
But Gregoire 's opponent does n't just oppose gay marriage — he 's promised to veto it if it ever passes the state legislature .
He also supports rolling back a provision in the state 's domestic - partner law that allows partners to inherit each other 's assets without a will , saying it would open the door for people to falsely claim a relationship where none existed .
Apparently Dino Rossi thinks gay people will sign domestic - partner agreements under false pretenses , or in ignorance of what they entail , simply to steal from each other .
And gay marriage is , again , just another issue Rossi " is n't running on " now — but which he 'll have plenty to say about if he goes on to higher office in the future .
7 : Pro-Life — For Some .
A bit of advice for those living in Dino Rossi's Washington :
Do n't get sick .
( Especially if you 're a low - income child ; see point number 1 , above . )
And if you do get sick , do n't get so sick you want to die — because Dino Rossi wants to keep you alive at any cost .
Rossi opposes Initiative 1000 , the " death with dignity " measure on the November ballot , because he " always errs on the side of life . "
He has said he 's glad his mother did n't have the option of physician - assisted suicide when she was sick with breast cancer , because she went on to live for two more years .
If I -1000 had been law , he told the Seattle Times , his mother would have probably opted to die , when all she really needed was a better nurse and a change of medication .
That 's a heart - warming anecdote .
And it includes a grain of truth :
We 'd all like to be able to access the very best health care and to die with as little suffering as possible .
But for people who are n't as fortunate as Rossi 's mother — people who do n't have the money to pay for health - care or who do have health - care but are in so much pain that just living is unbearable — I - 1000 offers an alternative .
Rossi and others who oppose physician - assisted suicide want to win the " pro-life " argument at the expense of thousands of Washington residents who will be forced to die in pain if physician - assisted suicide remains illegal .
On the other hand , if you have a genetic disease that could be cured by embryonic stem - cell research : tough shit .
While Rossi does support research on adult stem cells , he opposes embryonic stem - cell research , because embryos " have promise . "
This election matters — and not just because Barack Obama may defeat John McCain and start reversing the awful legacy of the last eight years .
Down - ticket races like Gregoire versus Rossi ( and I - 1000 and light - rail expansion and Tim Eyman 's proposal to make traffic worse ) affect people 's everyday lives .
( For more on these races , see " Your Vote Matters ! Really ! " in the special voter - registration section .
Gregoire has n't been a perfect governor — far from it .
But the differences between her and her opponent are vast .
Gregoire 's constant parroting of the " George W. Bush Republican " line is irritating , but it 's true :
It would make no sense for Washington to go for Obama — and simultaneously elect a Bush clone to the state 's highest elected office .
With a busy schedule that may constantly keep us on - the - go , it 's difficult to try and maintain a healthy lifestyle .
Eating healthy while away from home
It 's even more of a challenge to eat healthy while you are away from home , traveling for business or pleasure .
The key point is to make smart decisions and not allow the travel to become an excuse for unhealthy habits .
For this , one needs common sense and discipline in order to avoid the bad foods and keep ourselves healthy .
The goal of packing healthy food while traveling is :
To have convenient , non-processed foods available to you at all times during your travel .
To encourage you to eat every 3 - 4 hours .
To always combine a protein with a carbohydrate , so that food is absorbed slower and can help keep hunger a bay .
Start the day in a healthy way
Start the day with a healthy breakfast ; it makes one more likely to eat well through the day with less snacking on junk food .
Have a fresh fruit smoothie with soymilk , with protein powder added and even nutritional enhancers .
It is advisable to order hot oatmeal with some raisins or nuts added to it .
For egg eaters , they can order poached eggs for less fat .
Eat light foods
While traveling , remember to eat foods that are easy to digest .
Soups are a wise choice .
Heartier bean soups offer a good source of protein and are more filling ; while lighter soups like miso provide an energy and immune system boost .
Salads provide adequate amount of fiber and vegetables you need .
If the option of a salad bar is available , get peas , chickpeas , sunflower seeds , beets and other colourful vegetables added for a nutrient rich meal .
Select grilled chicken over fried ( or crunchy ) .
Big meal at lunch
When possible , eat your main meal at lunch and a light meal at dinner .
This is a healthier way to eat whether at home or traveling .
Drink plenty of water
Drink plenty of water to keep your system hydrated while you travel .
Keep a water bottle with you so that you have easy access to drink it throughout the day .
Try to explore different eating places
Look for ethnic restaurants that will offer a healthy variety of foods .
Japanese cuisine is typically low in fat and because vegetables , seafood , tofu , rice and noodles are used .
In a Chinese restaurant , a mixed vegetable dish , with bean curd for the protein can be ordered .
Mexican restaurants offer black bean soup , bean burritos and may offer food prepared without fat .
Italian restaurants have a range of fresh green salads with an olive - oil based dressing and also offer minestrone soup which includes vegetables .
Or one can even order a pasta dish with marinara sauce and a salad .
Thai restaurants are known to use lots of vegetables .
In Middle Eastern cuisine , choose combinations of vegetables and healthy grains such as tabouli , couscous , and pita bread .
Other healthy foods include falafel with tzatziki , pita and hummus with a couscous salad , lentil soup , spiced lentils with chapattis and legumes , a high - fiber , low - fat source of protein .
Business meeting for dinner
When eating out with business associates , look for a vegetarian entrée on the menu .
Avoid desserts but in case you find them irresistible , then go with the lighter desserts like fruit and cheese platters .
Order a wine instead of a mixed drink or beer .
It will have fewer calories and can be easily nursed along for hours .
Even fast food places like Subway now offer vegetarian subs prepared with whole grain breads .
In fact , the choice of restaurants for vegetarians is becoming more extensive .
Leisure travel
Taking a vacation should not mean abandoning all your healthy lifestyle choices because you can typically control your schedule in a vacation .
It is smart to realize that eating healthy can be very enjoyable and does not have to consist of a green salad for each meal ; and that way one can be just fine continuing healthy eating habits while on vacation .
If on a road trip , it is recommended to pack a camping stove and can relish the taste same as home cooked meal .
On a plane
It is wise to not to eat airline food .
Normally , whatever an airline offers is nothing but sugars and junk carbs .
Try to pack some fresh fruit or healthy sandwiches from home or if not , then try and find a Subway near the airport to get a Subway sandwich packed .
Get up once an hour and stretch or even do some light exercises like squats , lunges and calf raises .
Sleeping on plane causes body aches .
So try not to sleep while on a plane rather try doing something productive like read , watch a movie .
READ Stay Healthy on the Road : Rules for Travelers
In a hurry
For a quick breakfast or lunch , look for ready to drink soy shakes that you can refrigerate in a cooler , or in your hotel room 's refrigerator .
Dried fruits , nuts , seeds , trail mix and granola bars travel well and are good for healthy snacks on the road .
When in a hurry to catch a plane , there are a wide variety of things that can be had quickly and are still healthy .
The Subway wraps are quick and healthy , and a Taco Bell bean burrito , not exactly the paragon of good health but still better than a giant burger , can be had quickly .
Mexican food in general can be healthy while still being quick .
In a hotel room
Do not overeat because food expenses are covered by the company .
Well , because your health is not covered by your expense check .
Ask in advance for a fitness room in the hotel .
After arriving back at the hotel room after a big meal , do some simple workout .
Try spending a few minutes riding the stationary bike or walking on the treadmill to help you digest your meal before bedtime .
You will sleep more comfortably and awake feeling refreshed and energetic .
Also , it is a must to have a solid 8 hrs sleep for both your health and productivity .
Thus it is possible to keep your diet balanced and your body fit on - the - go .
Using these tips while traveling will help you reduce the stress of travel and will keep your body as healthy as possible .

Researchers at Houston ’s Rice University have demonstrated a new medium for data storage , which is made out of a mere 10 atom thick layer of graphite .
The technology has huge implications not only for advancing the capacities of flash memory , but also for space exploration with its ability to withstand radiation and temperatures of - 75 to 200 degrees Celsius , that would destroy modern Solid State Disks .
The team , who published their paper on the technology recently after 18 months of testing , were able to grow graphene ( 10 layers or less of graphite ) on top of silicon and store data .
The storage medium uses very little power , generates little heat and is thought to have a lifetime far superior to current flash memory .
Individual bits could apparently be made smaller than 10 nanometers , increasing storage capacity by a factor of five compared to 45 - nanometer circuitry in modern drives .
Toshiba yesterday announced an SSD developed using 43 - nanometer circuitry , but the theoretical limit for the current NAND technology is around 20nm , which is forecast to be reached by 2012 .
The researchers also point out another benefit of the technology , that the raw material is easily come by .
Those who still use pencils ( crossworders ) may even have some laying about the house .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Bush administration said Friday it might use taxpayer dollars set aside to bail out banks and Wall Street firms to keep troubled U.S. automakers out of bankruptcy , but a formal announcement is not expected this weekend .
A senior Bush administration official told CNN there will be " no news " Sunday on a bailout and that it would " be inappropriate to signal " when such an announcement might come .
" If there 's something to announce , we 'll announce it .
We 're not going to talk about if we 'll do something , what it 's going to be or when it 's going to come , " the official said .
White House spokesperson Tony Fratto added that the administration will " be focused on trying to get the policy right while considering the best interests of the taxpayer and our economy , and we 'll take the time we have available to do that right . "
However , the administration 's apparent willingness to use money from the bank bailout fund reverses its previous position on how to help the auto industry , and effectively revives a bailout proposal killed by senators of the president 's own party late Thursday night .
That plan had the support of congressional Democrats and the White House , but would have used a different source of funds to provide $ 14 billion in federal loans .
A move to loan money to the industry could provide an 11th - hour short - term lifeline to General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler LLC , which have warned they are within weeks of running out of the cash they need to continue to operate .
The defeat of the $ 14 billion bailout plan in the Senate left the administration little choice but to tap the $ 700 billion bailout approved by Congress in October , the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP .
" Given the current weakened state of the U.S. economy , we will consider other options if necessary -- including use of the TARP program -- to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers , " White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said in a statement .
" A precipitous collapse of this industry would have a severe impact on our economy . "
Talking to reporters after the release of the statement , Perino said that President Bush had met with aides Friday morning to discuss options .
Details of when the help might be provided out of TARP , how much money would be made available , and any restrictions on the cash were not immediately available .
The Treasury Department , which controls the TARP fund , also said it was looking at using the remaining money as stopgap help for the automakers .
" Because Congress failed to act , we will stand ready to prevent an imminent failure until Congress reconvenes and acts to address the long - term viability of the industry , " Treasury said in a statement .
House and Senate 2 different stories
The administration and congressional Democrats reached an agreement earlier this week on a $ 14 billion auto bailout to be funded with money set aside by Congress to help automakers shift production to more fuel efficient cars .
While Democrats had enough votes to get the loan package passed by the House on Wednesday , strong opposition from the Republican minority kept it from winning the 60 votes it needed to bring the matter up for a vote in the Senate .
After the vote Thursday night , several Democrats , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , urged Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to release the funds he controls as early as Friday .
The legislation would have placed a number of conditions on the loan .
It would have established a so - called car czar to oversee automakers ' efforts trying to win concessions from creditors and unions .
It also would have allowed the government to call the loans if the companies failed to make progress .
General Motors said that it is encouraged by the administration 's statements .
" We are prepared to work closely with the administration on possible solutions that could prevent further damage to our nation 's economy and also allow us to embark on an aggressive restructuring plan for long term viability , " GM said in a statement .
GM warns it needs $ 4 billion by the end of December and an additional $ 6 billion in the first two months of 2009 .
Chrysler said it needs $ 4 billion early next year .
Chrysler did not have an immediate comment , but at a press conference Friday morning , United Auto Workers union President Ron Gettelfinger , a strong advocate of a bailout , said the union appreciated the administration 's statements .
Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) has more cash on hand despite ongoing losses there as well .
So it is not expected to tap into funds in the near term .
But it has said it might need money later in 2009 if auto sales do not improve .
Stopgap measures
In total , the three automakers have asked Congress for up to $ 34 billion in loans to get them through to 2010 .
The $ 14 billion loan package voted on this week was seen as a stopgap measure to keep GM and Chrysler out of bankruptcy through the end of March .
That short - term solution was seen as a way for the new Congress and the incoming Obama administration to craft a more permanent solution to help the industry weather the current downturn in auto sales .
While the three major U.S. automakers have all been losing money and market share for years , the current cash crisis was sparked by a plunge in auto sales this fall in the wake of the crisis in the nation 's credit and financial markets .
The TARP money might end up being an even shorter - term solution , perhaps just until shortly after the new Congress takes office Jan .
6 .
One possible scenario : President Bush could loan money through early January , leaving it to the new Congress to try again to approve loans for the industry before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President - elect Obama .
The new Senate , which will be sworn in Jan. 6 , will have at least seven additional Democrats , perhaps as many as nine , who are not now in office .
If any TARP loan program expires before Jan. 20 , the need for Bush 's signature for any new bailout plan would give Republicans a voice they would lose in the more Democratic new Congress .
In a statement Friday , President - elect Obama said he is hopeful the administration and Congress can find a solution to get the auto industry the short - term help it needs .
" The revival of our economy as a whole should not be a partisan issue .
So I commend those in Congress as well as the administration who tried valiantly to forge a compromise , " Obama said .
Other than the political considerations , there are other problems with using TARP to help the auto industry now .
While Congress approved $ 700 billion in October , only half of that money was immediately available without an additional authorization from Congress .
And of that first $ 350 billion , only $ 15 billion of TARP funds remain unallocated to the nation 's banks .
Republican critics of a bailout have argued that the automakers should use bankruptcy to shed debt and onerous labor obligations .
They point to the success of companies in other troubled industries , such as airlines and steelmaking , to use bankruptcy to reorganize .
The automakers argued that bankruptcy is not an option .
They say consumers will not buy cars from a bankrupt automaker , and they point out they would have trouble getting funding during bankruptcy .
On top of that , bankruptcy could pose risks to the financial system .
The automakers have issued more than $ 70 billion in bonds that might default if they go out of business .
In addition , many major financial firms have written large numbers of financial instruments known as credit default swaps on that debt .
The firms could have to pay hundreds of billions of dollars to parties that bought the swaps as a bet that the automakers may not be able to pay those debts .
Fears that problems in the CDS market would cause problems in broader credit and financial markets is one of the reasons the Federal Reserve has loaned American International Group more than $ 100 billion .

Graphic images appear on cigarette packets to shock smokers into quitting
Shocking pictures of throat cancer and rotting teeth are to appear on cigarette packets from today to illustrate the health risks of smoking .
Among the other images smokers will see are rotting lungs , a corpse in a morgue and a body cut open during surgery .
The photos will appear on the back of packets accompanied by a written health warning .
Each cigarette packet carries a graphic image about the dangers of smoking
The images replace the previous warnings introduced in January 2003 , although the messages ' Smoking kills ' and ' Smoking seriously harms you and others around you ' will continue to appear on the front of packets .
New figures showed written warnings had motivated more than 90,000 smokers to call the NHS Smoking Helpline , the Department of Health said .
Poll
Do you think cigarette packets should carry graphic pictures ?

However , smoking is still the biggest killer in England where it causes the premature death of more than 87,000 people each year .
The photos are expected to be more effective than text , and research suggested that warnings should be changed periodically to maintain their effectiveness , the DoH said .
The smokers ' lobby group Forest criticised the new warnings as ' unnecessarily intrusive ' and ' gratuitously offensive ' .
Forest director Simon Clark said : ' We support measures that educate people about the health risks of smoking , but these pictures are designed not just to educate but to shock and coerce people to give up a legal product .
' They are unnecessarily intrusive , gratuitously offensive , and yet another example of smokers being singled out for special attention . '
However , Action on Smoking and Health ( Ash ) director Deborah Arnott said : ' The stark images in the picture warnings on tobacco products are a call to action to smokers to quit , and the evidence is that they work .
' The evidence also shows that picture warnings work better on plain packs , so we are urging the Government to also implement legislation to require the removal of pack branding to maximise the impact of the these images . '
A smokers ' lobby group called the images ' intrusive ' and ' offensive '
Canada was the first country to introduce picture warnings in 2001 .
Research a year later found 31 per cent of ex-smokers said the images had motivated them to quit the habit while 27 per cent said they had helped them to remain non-smokers , according to the DoH .
Graphic images are now used on tobacco products sold in Australia , Brazil , Canada , India , New Zealand , Singapore , Venezuela , Thailand and Uruguay .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A new national poll suggests Sarah Palin may be hurting Republican presidential nominee John McCain more than she 's helping him .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey released Sunday indicates McCain 's running mate is growing less popular among voters and may be costing him a few crucial percentage points in the race for the White House .
Fifty - seven percent of likely voters questioned in the poll said Palin does not have the personal qualities a president should have .
That 's up 8 points since September .
Fifty - three percent say she does not agree with them on important issues .
That 's also higher than September .
" Just after the GOP convention in early September , 53 percent said they would vote for Palin over Joe Biden if there were a separate vote for vice president .
Now , Biden would beat Palin by 12 points if the running mates were chosen in a separate vote , " said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
And what if voters were allowed to vote for president separately ?
" It would be a 4 - point edge for Barack Obama , 52 percent to 48 percent .
Since the McCain - Palin ticket is currently getting 46 percent in a match - up against the Obama - Biden ticket , it looks like Palin 's presence on the GOP ballot is taking 2 percentage points away from McCain .
In a close race , that might represent the margin of victory , " Holland said .
The unfavorable numbers for Palin , Alaska 's governor , also have been growing .
They are 8 points higher in the current poll than in early October , and they 're twice as high as they were when McCain announced his running mate in late August .

" John McCain has also been suspect with conservatives , the base of the Republican Party , and they were never enthusiastic about his candidacy .
Palin was a unusual pick .
She was well known with conservative insiders but unknown outside .
When she was named , there was a rush of enthusiasm among conservatives and everyone was impressed by McCain 's unusual and unexpected choice , " said Bill Schneider , CNN 's senior political analyst .
" The more many Americans have found out about Palin , the less they like her . "
Meanwhile , the poll also suggests Americans may not be as concerned as McCain about one - party rule if Obama is elected president .
One of McCain 's closing arguments has been that the Democrats are poised to increase their majorities in Congress , and that Obama -- the Democratic presidential nominee -- is " working out the details " with Democratic leaders to raise taxes , increase spending and " concede defeat in Iraq . "
But in the poll , 50 percent of likely voters said if Obama wins the White House , Congress should be controlled by Democrats , with 48 percent saying it should be controlled by Republicans .
Fifty - nine percent said if McCain wins the presidential election , Congress should be controlled by Democrats , with 39 percent saying Republicans should control it .
Democrats currently have a 235 to 199 majority in the House of Representatives and a 51 to 49 majority in the Senate -- the chamber 's two independent senators are allied with the Democrats .
One of Obama 's closing points is that McCain would carry out George Bush 's policies if elected , saying the Arizona senator has " ridden shotgun " with the president on economic policy .
The poll suggests that 53 percent think McCain would mostly carry out Bush 's policies , with 45 percent saying he would not .
Only 28 percent approve of the way Bush is handling his job as president .
Likely voters questioned in the poll were also asked whether Obama will win the election .
Watch more on the final days of campaigning »
" Nine in 10 think it 's likely ; nearly half say it is very likely .
Only 1 in 10 say it is very likely that McCain will win , while half say a McCain victory is unlikely , " Holland said .
How will Obama supporters react if he does not win on Tuesday ?
According to the poll , one in five will be angry ; one in four will be upset but not angry .
Most Obama supporters , however , say they will be disappointed but not angry or upset if McCain wins .
The poll also suggests the Democrats are much more excited about this election than Republicans .
Forty - five percent of Democrats questioned said they are extremely enthusiastic about voting this year , compared to 28 percent of Republicans .
" The economy remains the No. 1 issue to most voters .
But although 8 in 10 say that economic conditions are poor now , 62 percent say that the economy will be in good shape a year from now , " Holland said .
" The economy , which is already a strong issue , jumped even further in importance after the financial crisis hit in September .
" And since the public tends to blame the Republicans more than the Democrats for that crisis , that event provided a boost not just to Barack Obama but to Democratic candidates across the country .
Democratic congressional candidates have a 9 - point lead in the ' generic ballot ' question . "
The generic ballot asks voters their preference for U.S. House without naming the candidates running in each district .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted Thursday through Saturday , with 1,017 adult Americans , including 950 registered voters and 716 likely voters , questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error ranges from plus or minus 3 percentage points to plus or minus 4.5 percentage points , depending on the question .
All About John McCain • Barack Obama • U.S. Presidential Election • Sarah Palin
Exclusive to STR
November 10 , 2008
It nearly happened in 2004 when I watched him speak at the Democratic National Convention .
It nearly happened again when I watched him address tens of thousands of screaming supporters at the 2008 convention .
It tempted me -- oh , temptation ! -- during his performance at the debates .
I really had to hold myself back when I saw the crowd in Times Square going wild upon hearing of his big win .
But it was when Jesse Jackson appeared on the TV with tears in his eyes that I finally gave in .
I could n't help but rush for some tissues to dry my own flooded eyes , choked up and ecstatic in spite of myself over the election of the first black President of the US , racism finally ending , fundamental reform and Change finally coming to America , a new dawn rising ...
OK , not really .
Actually , I 'm probably the only person I know who did n't worship at the altar of Obama this year .
Instead I 've learned to beware the man on the white horse .
Following this week 's media coverage of Obama 's election has been an exercise in resisting a triumph of sentimentality and emotional appeals over reason and the real issues at hand .
But resistance , while not futile , proved somewhat testing .
More than any political elections I 've ever seen in my 25 years , this one boiled down to cults of personality -- one cult versus the other , bold speeches , heartrending appeals , blood , sweat and tears , glittering generalities , heroic mantras , more tears , inspiring words about change and bringing people together and the common good , even more inspiring life stories , an appeal to Hope , more tears ... and not a hint of real substance to back all this up .
To be fair , Obama talks a good talk and ran a good campaign , but the only positive thing I can really say about him is that he might not launch a nuclear holocaust on Iran and provoke another 9/11 .
And that 's a big might .
I do n't like sentimentality in my politics .
I 'm a hard - nosed , rational man of the issues .
And on the issues , neither of the two officially - approved candidates really proved that they " get it " , whether it 's increasing encroachments of state power , the root causes of the economic crisis ( an unsustainable corporatist / state - capitalist system ) , imperialistic wars being fundamentally wrong no matter if it's a Democrat or Republican waging them , the perils of letting governments legislate morality and subsidize corporations and undermine communities in taking care of their own , etc.
McCain of course has been selling out to the neocons for the better part of a decade , and Obama not only supported the $ 700 billion corporate bailout , he has n't exactly been a firebrand against the White House and telecoms spying on Americans , he has n't shown nearly the pioneering guts of his fellow Democrat Dennis Kucinich in opposing the war , and he shows no understanding of how government and central banking created this economic mess we 're in .
Ron Paul was the only major candidate talking intelligently on these issues , and we saw where that ended up .
Despite the facts , it 's easy to see why so many would choose to send him to the White House .
Having the neocons and their grubby poster - boy George W. Bush around for eight years was n't fun at all .
Bloody wars , corruption , attacks on our liberties , economic brinkmanship , a stream of lies and justifications and overall dishonesty , broken promises , staggering incompetence , and the most unpopular President in US history , a man whose mental capacities lead us to fear for the gene pool ; all of these would lead someone to hope for a hero to deliver them from the mess .
Apparently they think Obama is that hero .
Commentators have been saying repeatedly that Obama 's campaign changed the tone of political elections .
And it 's true that Obama posing as Mr. Nice Guy , an honest , straightforward man who eschews negativity in order to solve our problems and help us get along again , excited people after eight years of torture in the Fourth Circle of Hell .
But I tell you : beware the man on the white horse .
In times of crisis , uncertainty and strife , people do n't often respond to " cool " rational appeals ; they respond to " warm " emotional ones .
The War on Terror , like the election , is another recent example of how these appeals -- sentimental mush , inspiring platitudes , imagery and unsubstantiated media hype -- can be used to win people over by appealing to fear , anxiety , a sense of desperation , yet - unfulfilled hopes and aspirations , and a missing sense of greater purpose .
Reagan did it in 1980 , FDR did it in 1932 , Charles DeGaulle did it in 1958 , Hugo Chavez did it in 1998 , Lenin did it in 1917 .
Then as now , in troubling times , we want someone or something to deliver us from our troubles and inspire us and bring justice to the downtrodden and lift up our hearts .
We 'll take anybody , we 'll take anything , just as long as we feel that our Savior will come through for us .
It does n't matter what the facts are .
Our hero could be a sell - out like McCain for all we care .
Or , like Obama , our hero could offer vague generalities , poorly - conceived plans , inadequate solutions , and endless appeals to Hope ( for what ? ) , Change ( how ? ) and " Yes we can ! " ( can do what ? ) , despite his record lacking either a distinctive reformist streak or bold assaults on attacks on civil liberties and Wall Street 's economic terrorism .
But I tell you : beware the man on the white horse .
Despite Obama 's insistence that the government can't solve all our problems , the modern social - democratic State and its agents do sustain themselves by encouraging an almost religious zeal at times .
To the more fervent believers , the State knows better than you what to eat , what medical decisions to make , what schools to go to , who to marry , how much money or energy you should consume , what TV shows your kids should watch , who to do business with , which foreigners you ought to dislike , and so on .
Social problems ?
Just knock on doors , attend a few rallies , go to the polls one day and voila ! -- all fixed !
And watch with glee as our Patriot missiles blow up thousands of brown - skinned Terrorists to smithereens !
Forget about decentralized , local , community - based methods of social organization , direct action to solve problems and address injustice , and the proven capacity of the market to lift more people out of poverty and ignorance than any primitive collectivist or unsustainable corporatist arrangement ever could .
No , you 'd be helpless without us !
But I tell you : beware the man on the white horse .
I do n't have any heroes .
I do n't need any .
And neither should you .
If somebody can pose themselves as a hero and sell you a sense of salvation ( half - baked though it be ) , then they own your mind and they own you , for you are in debt to them , and you are beholden to them .
More than any aspect of the political , economic , or social system , it is this kind of psychological domination that the lover of liberty recognizes and opposes with every fiber of his being .
The man on the white horse brings no real ' change ' ; he serves to distract your passions and lure you back into the fold so that you do n't demand real , radical change .
The hype over Obama 's campaign and election victory is n't just a mere triumph of style over substance ; it shows how the State and its agents use sentimentality and vacuous emotional appeals to play on people 's desperation and win back their hearts and minds , despite its demonstrable failures , inadequacies , and abuses .
If the past eight years under Bush have showcased many of the Leviathan State 's shortcomings , the next four years will show how they try to compensate for them and win back people 's unwitting fervor .
And that makes me want to cry harder than Jesse Jackson and Oprah did at Grant Park on Tuesday night .
There is a rule in Formula
One that the drivers are very afraid of .
They really should never break this .
Just so they know exactly what this rule is , there is another ( unwritten ) rule for the officials that insists they repeatedly demonstrate to the drivers exactly what it is the drivers should not do .
It ’s called “ Bringing the sport into disrepute ” and while drivers are not allowed ever to break this rule , the officials can and do do this on a regular basis .
From sex scandals at the very top of the governing body , to questionable actions and repeated favouritism on the behalf of the FIA Stewards when it comes to applying the laws that are written down .
At Monaco , Kimi Raikkonnen skidded on a damp track at the chicane just after exiting the tunnel , and ploughed into fourth placed Adrian Sutil in the Force India , knocking the talented young driver out of a points scoring position .
Did the FIA stewards penalise Raikkonen ?
No .
At the time , Mike Gascoyne , the Force India Technical Director , said that if it were the other way around Sutil would probably have received a two race ban .
The FIA officials explanation ?
They said that because Sutil overtook three cars under yellow flags he would have got a drive through penalty worth 25 seconds so he would n’t have finished in the points anyway .
Pardon ?
That ’s a bit like saying you ’re allowed to rob the bank if the bank made an accounting error on someone else ’s account !
Surely they should both have been given penalties – Sutil ’s infringement should not mean Raikonnen ’s need no penalty .
That ’s crazy .
At Valencia , right on camera , Felipe Massa broke a law in the pits which at the least should have given him a drive through penalty – GP2 drivers breaking the same law the same weekend at the same track were actually disqualified .
But Felipe drives a Ferrari , the FIA ’s favourite car .
They did n’t disqualify him , they did n’t give him a Stop and Go , they did n’t even give him a drive through .
For the first time ever , they decided to “ investigate the matter at the end of the race ” .
Well , at the end of the race Felipe won by 5.6 seconds from Lewis Hamilton .
The FIA Stewards decided Massa had done something wrong , but did not apply a post facto drive through penalty by adding 20 to 30 seconds to his race time .
No , they said he should pay a fine so small in comparison to his salary ( and one probably picked up by his team anyway ) that it in reality is not a penalty at all .
Move on to the next race , the Belgian Grand Prix at the famous Spa - Francorchamps circuit in the hills and forest of the Ardennes and a day of mixed weather .
Ferraris are renowned for not being able to get heat into their tyres as quickly as the McLarens which also perform better on cold rubber , so when the race started with half the track damp and half dry an interesting prospect for all was in sight .
The last five to ten laps or so were the most interesting , because that ’s when it rained .
Up until this point Kimi Raikkonnen had done a great job in holding Lewis Hamilton off and had a pretty stable 5.8 seconds advantage .
Felipe Massa was nowhere to be seen in third .
There had only been one incident involving the stewards when they gave a drive through penalty to Heikki Kovalainen when he was hesitant about overtaking Mark Webber and then slid into him on the greasy track at the chicane on the run up to Les Combes .
So , down came the rain .
The race woke up .
So did the audience .
In the space of about 4 laps , Lewis Hamilton closed the 5.8 lap gap between him and Kimi until he was right behind him , breaking later for every corner , travelling faster at every apex .
There was no way that in the 2 laps of the race that remained Kimi was going to be able to resist being overtaken with such a differential between the cars .
At what used to be known as the “ bus stop chicane ” Lewis went past Kimi on the outside .
Kimi kept it tight on entry , then squeezed Lewis on the exit on the greasy track so there were only two possibilities for the British driver : hit Raikkonnen , or go off the track and cut the corner .
Not wishing to be accused of “ causing an avoidable accident ” ( as Raikonnen had not been at Monaco ) Hamilton opted to cut the corner , then allowed Raikkonnen to move back into first place .
Raikkonnen started weaving to prevent the man from Stevenage from getting past .
In the space of less than a La Source second , Raikkonnen weaved , Hamilton dodged , Hamilton passed .
This was racing , one of the best passing moves in racing history , taking me back to that superb move of Mansell on Senna when he passed the great Brazilian at the Hungaroring in in the flash of an eye in 1987 or the move of Hakkinnen on Schumacher at Les Combes in 1999 .
Yes , it was that good .
Apparently the FIA Stewards ( Frances ’s Nicholas Deschaux , Surinder Thatthi of Kenya and Belgian Yves Bacquelaine ) believe that remaining in second after cutting a corner at a chicane to avoid an accident gave Lewis an advantage he would n’t otherwise have had .
Therefore they gave him a penalty .
Not a fine , a 25 second penalty – not enough to let Alonso finish on the podium of course , but not so much that would mean Hamilton only lost one place .
So , the odd 25 second penalty was applied .
McLaren have announced they will appeal .
So they should .
So now we have yet another means by which the FIA bring their own sport into disrepute .
Man , have they got a thing against McLaren !
And do they looooove Ferrari … but they certainly do n’t apply justice .
Why is that ?
Answers on a post card please not including bent stewards , bribery , gambling scandals , institutional corruption , or blackmail .
Pettiness of individuals I can accept .
Incompetence I can certainly accept .
Jealousy , meanness , and racism too .
What do you think ?
Incidentally , the BBC website hit a record for the number of people posting complaints about this injustice .
Next year , the BBC take over the contract for F1 TV coverage .
Will they have any audience left ?
At this rate , the FIA will have killed off interest in their own Championship .
Update :
It ’s just been confirmed that I was right .
She stopped over to refuel and did not visit .
Bloggers do the vetting again …
So the Republican ’s Vice Presidential Nominee Sarah Palin has visited Ireland – this is listed as part of her foreign travel experience .
She only got a passport last year and visited US troops ( Alaskan National Guard ) in Kuwait and Germany .
Two words to describe that visit to Ireland I think .
SHANNON STOPOVER ! *
I could of course be wrong and Governor Palin was over to find her roots ??
More as I get it .
* For US readers the Shannon Stopover refers to planes landing at Shannon Airport to refuel when on their way to and from parts of Europe / Middle East .
Shannon Airport sees many US Military and contractor flights arrive there each month for refueling – passengers get off the plane for a while and then get back on again .
Hardly a visit to Ireland ?
( CNN ) -- Archaeologists believe they have unearthed only a small fraction of Egypt 's ancient ruins , but they 're making new discoveries with help from high - tech allies -- satellites that peer into the past from the distance of space .
The enclosure wall of the Great Aten temple in Egypt , as seen from the QuickBird satellite .
" Everyone 's becoming more aware of this technology and what it can do , " said Sarah Parcak , an archaeologist who heads the Laboratory for Global Health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham .
" There is so much to learn . "
Images from space have been around for decades .
Yet only in the past decade or so has the resolution of images from commercial satellites sharpened enough to be of much use to archaeologists .
Today , scientists can use them to locate ruins -- some no bigger than a small living room -- in some of the most remote and forbidding places on the planet .
In this field , Parcak is a pioneer .
Her work in Egypt has yielded hundreds of finds in regions of the Middle Egypt and the eastern Nile River Delta .
Parcak conducted surveys and expeditions in the eastern Nile Delta and Middle Egypt in 2003 and 2004 that confirmed 132 sites that were initially suggested by satellite images .
Eighty - three of those sites had never been visited or recorded .
In the past two years , she has found hundreds more , she said , leading her to amend an earlier conclusion that Egyptologists have found only the tip of the iceberg .
" My estimate of 1/100th of 1 percent of all sites found is on the high side , " Parcak said .
These discoveries are of no small significance to the Egyptian government , which has devoted itself anew to protecting archaeological sites from plunder and encroachment .
The Supreme Council of Antiquities has restricted excavation in the most sensitive areas along the Nile -- from the Great Pyramids at Giza on the outskirts of Cairo to the carvings of Ramses II in the remote south .
Antiquities officials hope the move will encourage more surveys in the eastern Nile Delta in northern Egypt , Parcak said , where encroaching development in the burgeoning nation of 82 million poses the greatest threat to the sites .
Old and modern methods
Parcak 's process weds modern tools with old - fashioned grunt work .
The archaeologist studies satellite images stored on a NASA database and plugs in global positioning coordinates for suspected sites , then tramps out to see them .
Telltale signs such as raised elevations and pot shards can confirm the images .
As a result , the big picture comes into view .
" We can see patterns in settlements that correspond to the [ historical ] texts , " Parcak said , " such as if foreign invasions affected the occupation of ancient sites .
" We can see where the Romans built over what the Egyptians had built , and where the Coptic Christians built over what the Romans had built .
" It 's an incredible continuity of occupation and reuse . "
The flooding and meanders of the Nile over the millennia dictated where and how ancient Egyptians lived , and the profusion of new data has built a more precise picture of how that worked .
" Surveys give us information about broader ancient settlement patterns , such as patterns of city growth and collapse over time , that excavations do not , " said Parcak , author of a forthcoming book titled " Satellite Remote Sensing and Archaeology . "
The vagaries of climate in the region make satellite technology advantageous , too .
" Certain plants that may indicate sites grow during certain times of the year , " Parcak said , " while sites may only appear during a wet or dry season .
This is different everywhere in the world . "
Archaeologists working in much more verdant climates , such as Cambodia and Guatemala , also have used the technology to divine locations of undiscovered ruins .
They have been able to see similarities between the vegetation at known sites and suspected sites that showed up in fine infrared and ultraviolet images covering wide areas of forbidding terrain .
" For the work I do [ in Egypt ] , I need wet season images as wet soil does a better job at detecting sites with the satellite imagery data I use , " Parcak said .
" I can pick the exact months I need with the NASA satellite datasets . "
Benefits of a bird 's - eye view
Remote subsurface sensing has been used in archaeology in one form or another for years , though the term " remote " does n't necessarily imply great distance .
Typically , a surveyor has wheeled a sensing device over a marked - out area to determine what lies below .
The sensing devices employ any of an array of technologies , such as Ground Penetrating Radar .
They bounce signals off objects below the surface and translate the data into images that a scientist 's trained eye can decipher .
Multispectral imaging encompasses technologies that " see " what the human eye can't , such as infrared and ultraviolet radiation .
Scientists have used it for years to study the Earth 's surface for a variety of purposes .
Until resolution of these images improved , though , the only way to produce a sharp image was to be relatively close to the ground .
For those lugging unwieldy gear across jungle and desert , an effective bird 's - eye view can change the world .
It lets them leave behind the days and days of meticulous " prospecting " and get results from airplane - mounted sensors or , later on , a flyover by an advanced satellite .
One of the most advanced is called QuickBird , which has been in orbit since 2001 and can provide high - resolution images of 11 - mile - wide swaths .
The satellite can collect nearly 29 million square miles of imagery data in a year , according to DigitalGlobe , which developed and operates QuickBird .
The company , based in Longmont , Colorado , is working on an upgrade .
WorldView - 2 , to be launched in 2009 , will offer sharper resolution of visual and multispectral images than QuickBird , according to the company 's Web site .
In the end , though , a tool is only as useful as its wielder .
" Most of the advances have come through processing on the ground by end users such as Dr. Parcak , " said DigitalGlobe spokesman Chuck Herring .

Bush Looting The American Tax Payer On The Way Out
By Ben Cohen
If there was ever any doubt that George Bush was a fanatical neo colonialist criminal , there should n't be any more .
As Naomi Klein reports , the Bush Administration is doing its very best to imitate colonial Europe 's behavior when it gave up its colonies during the 20th century , and loot its subjects of every last drop :
When European colonialists realised that they had no choice but to
hand over power to the indigenous citizens , they would often turn their
attention to stripping the local treasury of its gold and grabbing

valuable livestock .
If they were really nasty , like the Portuguese in
Mozambique in the mid-1970s , they poured concrete down the elevator
shafts .
Nothing so barbaric for the Bush gang .
Rather than open
plunder , it prefers bureaucratic instruments , such as " distressed
asset " auctions and the " equity purchase program " .
But make no mistake :
the goal is the same as it was for the defeated Portuguese - a final ,
frantic looting of the public wealth before they hand over the keys to the safe .
Passwords !
We have a love - hate relationship with them because while they are a good safety measure , they are getting easier and easier to breach and harder to remember .
It ’s recommended to have strong and secure passwords for all websites you visit , but really , who can keep up ?
Did you know that the most commonly used passwords include things like “ qwerty ” “ password ” or “ 123456 . ”
They may be easy to remember , but they are just as easy to hack .
If like most people you also use a similar password for multiple accounts , you ’ll endanger all your data at the same time .
Hackers have been trying to steal passwords since the existence of the internet .
Poor passwords lead to more than 80 percent of company data breaches .
There may be no such thing as an unbeatable password because professional hackers will always use sophisticated hardware and software to hack accounts they really need .
Still , there are several ways you can make it hard for them by strengthening your passwords .
In this post , we ’ll share some awesome life hacks that will help you create strong passwords that are hard to crack , keeping your data safe .
1. Use Quirky Characters for Secure Passwords
One of the best ways of achieving secure passwords is by using quirky character types in your passwords .
You must understand that hackers use state - of - the - art technology to test different combinations of letters , numbers and symbols .
It gets easier to decode shorter passwords , but it may be a complicated process for long ones .
The thing is , the software has to keep trying different combinations , and most websites only offer several password entries before blocking an account .
This means that the more quirky symbols you add to your password , the harder it is for the software to decode your credentials .
The hacker is more likely to get locked out of the website before they can hack the correct password .
2. Use Long Passwords or Paraphrases
Beyond that , you need to make your passwords long enough to evade hacker ’s tactics .
When hackers use the “ brute force attack , ” an advanced method used to guess passwords , they have an easier time cracking passwords with the first attempt .
The longer you make your passwords , and the more complex they are , the harder it will be for them to decipher .
Apart from making passwords long , you may also use paraphrases that are easier for you to remember .
Avoid using dictionary words because if words are not published , they are not grammatically correct and hence hard to crack .
Avoid using numbers or letters in sequence on the keyboard since they are easier to guess .
For instance , numerous people use “ qwerty ” as a password , something anyone can crack .
Mix up letters , numbers and symbols randomly to spice it up .
Substitute numbers for letters and vice versa .
For instance , substitute @ for A and zero for O .
If you choose to go with a paraphrase , you can capitalize the first letter of every word , complicating it further .
3. Avoid Obvious Personal Information
You ’d be surprised at the number of people who use personal information such as birthdays , anniversaries , addresses , and pet names as passwords .
Avoid making these common mistakes because such information is easily discoverable and easy to access .
If you need to use security questions , avoid using questions whose answers are easy to find on your social media accounts .
Additionally , you should not reuse passwords for two or more accounts or websites .
4. Use a Password Manager
Given the advancement of technology , it ’s possible to use a password manager if you are having a hard time generating secure passwords .
One of the best things about using a password manager is the fact that the information is stored in a centralized and encrypted location .
You get to have one master password that safeguards all other passwords .
There are many secure passwords apps out there , some of which are free while others are paid for .
Some password managers such as SpyCloud Active Directory Guardian come with sophisticated features that allow you to sync your passwords across different devices .
They also audit passwords to ensure you do not use similar passwords in different locations .
Some of the most significant benefits of using a password manager are to generate secure passwords and have fast access to them .
You will not waste time fumbling with logins or trying to recover forgotten passwords .
5. Use a Two - Factor Authentication
Two - Factor authentication makes it harder for hackers to get through .
Even when a hacker gets your password , accessing your account still wo n’t be easy .
You see , two - factor authentication requires users to know something extra , such as a code sent to your phone .
In such a case , a hacker would require to have both your password and your phone in order to get the code and access the account .
Bonus Point : Keep Passwords Under Wraps
Never give your passwords to anyone and avoid typing them in your device within plain sight of others .
Plastering passwords on sticky notes is not advisable either and if you have to store them in a file , give it a random name , so it ’s hard for snoopers to guess where the passwords are .
To have secure passwords , you could also consider changing them after a while .
Once you change them , avoid reusing them again .
This is so much easier if you decide to use a secure password generator .
A professional passwords app will keep your information safe enough that you wo n’t need to write them on sticky notes or a notepad , which will enhance your security .
Keep It Complex !
The more complicated your passwords are , the harder they ’ll be to crack .
Using a secure password generator can save you all the trouble of coming up with new secure passwords each time you need to sign up to an account .
Take the right measures today and safeguard your delicate information .
Cybersecurity has become a very delicate issue , and the last thing you need is some stranger accessing your data and stealing your identity .
A lot of things can go wrong is that were to happen , so take matters into your hands .
There are numerous articles on this site with useful information about technology .

Listed below are links to weblogs that reference Europe mapped by language :
Comments
The Romanian and Moldovan language are one and the same , actually .
Only due to recent political decisions they are regarded as two different languages , since Moldova is now an independent republic .
The comment saying that Transylvania is historically a region of Hungary is a case of propaganda that still exists , because the past conflicts between Romania and Hungary .
Transylvania was indeed under Hungarian domination for a while , until it was recovered , but the population 's nationality and language was always Romanian .
Hungarian language is spoken only by the Hungarian minorities in Romania , who have the right to study it in schools besides the official Romanian language ; but it is not ' spreading ' .
The only one needing to ' get the facts ' is the person who posted that comment on a article containing what was supposed to be a neutral study , trying to pollute it with xenophobic and extremist claims .
By the way , in the south of Italy , most people are speaking the local dialect , not the official Italian .

I love these kinds of maps , but it seems that some of the selected languages might be slightly historical .
It still amazes me though how certain remote areas can hold on to a native language even when most of the people do n't speak it .

You could try to be a little more constructive in your criticism .
But then again you are turtle - neck wearing cowards who have historically murdered people over these differences .
Nice Map , you should do a North American one next , I 'd like to see the differences in dialects of English , as well as French , Spanish and First Nations languages .

This is a map of language over time and the movement of language ... the problem is that it is missing a date in time for when these languages were in each country / county / state etc .
Regardless , it is not the current map , that 's for sure .
And yes , Lap is correct , Lappish is a dead , or almost dead , language in the Uralic branch of languages .
I seriously suggest everyone who attacked this man for simply putting up a map of languages to educate yourself instead of responding strictly on pride for your country and language .
Posted by : Laura | Nov 21 , 2008 10:33:51 PM
The map is quite faulty and misleading .
In Luxembourg there are three official languages , german , french and louxembourgish which is a germanic dialect but still very different from german .
As far as I know louxembourgish is spoken by most people in Luxembourg .

Concerning Sami language ( or Lapp as you call it )
Someone has correctly stated that you can't use the term Lapp in these countries any more .
No less than the term " negro " in the US !
But my main concern is the fact that the colors indicate that the Sami language is the only one or perheps the predominant one in northern Scandinavia .
Which of course is not correct .
The Sami language is spoken here , but only by a minority .
On the Norwegian side of the border , to the North , practically everybody speaks Norwegian and only about 1/4 of the population also speak Sami .
I am uncertain as to the figures for Finland and Sweden , but I believe the same goes there : Nearly all the people speak the national languages , including Sami people .
And they only constitute a small minority even in their own areas .

Sorry , but from an Irish perspective this map is totally wrong , very few of us speak Gaelic fluently .
We all study it in school , it 's obligatory , but only about 40,000 people on the Western fringes of the country use it on a daily basis .
I 'm proud that the Irish language has n't completely died yet but it makes me smile when I read references to census figures that say that 1.6 M of my country 's 4 M population is bilingual .

There are no Germans left in Romania .
They 've all gone to West Germany during the communist years - who can blame them , the Romanians would have gone too but they were n't allowed .
I think this is true for the whole East Europen area .

ALTHOUGH THERE'S NOT MANY SPEAKERS IT IS MAKING A COMEBACK , ROAD SIGNS ETC ARE ALSO MARKED IN CORNISH AS WELL AS ENGLISH .
CORNWALL PARTICIPATES IN THE CORNISH GAMES AND IS CONSIDERED VERY MUCH A CELTIC COUNTRY .

you may find " Lapp " is considered derogatory in Northern Scandinavia .
The linguistic stock is " Sami "

The term " Lapp " is considered derogatory , or even racist , by Sami people in Norway .
Is this really the correct term in english ?

In " illes Balears " the most spoken language is german , not catalan .

The comments to this entry are closed .
Paul Kimelman lives in Alamo , Calif. , and is C.T.O. of the Texas - based microcontroller company Luminary Micro .
He is the sort of blog reader we are very fortunate to have .
He writes to us now and again with such interesting queries that they ’re worth putting up on the blog in their entirety .
Here ’s his latest :
I was speaking with a colleague the other day and he was remarking on an accomplishment I have had in my field ( of microprocessor design ) .
He assumed I had been a straight - A student all through school .
When I noted that I was far from it , he was shocked .
This got me to thinking : we usually just assume that somehow grades in school ( at any level ) are predictors of future success , or certainly of intelligence ; but I highly doubt it .
I tried to find some good studies , but found five problems immediately :
1 . The very definition of success is elusive .
Is a straight - A student who went all the way through Harvard Business School a success if she sells insurance ?
If she opens a business , what determines when it is a success ?
A hardware store in Iowa may not cut it , but creating Home Depot presumably does ; what about all the variance in between ?
It is even more complex in many other areas .
In engineering , being a worker bee is success , but great advancements do not come from those people ; so what are we even trying to measure ?
If we try to put a scale on it , what metric should we use ?
Income , even attempts at “ earned income , ” is tricky for many reasons , but most obviously the inequity of different fields in terms of income potential .
A highly successful grade - school teacher ( measured by students who become motivated [ by that teacher ] , and [ were ] thus successful ) will always do poorly compared to even a middling professional football player .
The highly successful lawyer who does a lot of pro bono work comes off worse than the ambulance chaser .
Hierarchy in the field does not really work , since few fields have clear gradations or career paths , and many such paths are not reflections of success , but only reflections of time .
2 . How do you measure validity of grades ?
Besides the obvious problem of the A from a poor - quality school being worth less than from a high - quality one , you also have grade inflation , subjective measurements , and , more importantly , subject difficulty .
[ Subject difficulty ] is more problematic .
Someone who gets all A’s in “ communications ” at a university is probably not working as hard as someone who gets all A ’s in physics .
Yet this is all subjective .
Why would we assume that physics is “ harder ” than , say , literary critique ?
This is especially problematic in high school and middle school , where many “ hard ” subjects are about memorizing and repeating well - defined steps .
Literary critique has no well - defined guide posts ( unless you cheat and plagiarize ) , and so requires a deeper understanding of what is to be done .
3 . Most middle schools and high schools put so much emphasis on homework versus actual understanding that they are measuring behavior and compliance far more than what has been learned .
So we end up with two issues : we may well predict success [ only ] at compliance - oriented fields , and we do not know how many have been trampled so that their possible future success has been lost .
Further , this method likely pushes more people towards compliance - oriented behavior , and so reduces their potential for success outside of this narrow measure .
We certainly see this in other countries ( e.g. Japan ) .
4. Creativity and creative people tend to mess up metrics at each level .
Creative people tend to do worse on grades at each level of schooling , yet their success measures can be very high in their fields .
However , creative people can also be abject failures as a result of their creative natures ; so we have no good metric that predicts [ how successful ] these people [ will be ] .
Even trying to separate out creative people in schools is hard , as much of their behavior is similar to those who are just lazy , have A.D.H.D. , or are generally disruptive .
We often do not know the underpinnings of their behaviors until much later , and many may have been crushed under the molding systems of our schools .
Further , many of the most successful [ people ] are specifically creative with high strengths in mathematics and its implementation : in economics , physics , chemistry , engineering ( including civil ; think of many of the most dramatic bridges and buildings ) , and so on .
5 . Any research I could find was done at some university which tended to bias results using university metrics of success .
This is likely unavoidable for the above reasons , but results from different studies were so contradictory that you have to conclude filtering and selection bias had a very large role to play as well .
What interests me is whether the present system actually produces more success or heavily limits it .
Would a different system with less emphasis on conformity produce more of our best and brightest ?
Or does the annealing effect of being crushed by the system help to produce those best and brightest ?
If you look at those who have commonly advanced our thinking , our abilities , our technologies , and our economy ( through business sense ) , many did poorly in schools , yet they persisted .
The persistence may have been the critical element , and it would have perhaps been lost had they been encouraged more .
So does this mean we need more of those mediocre middle school and high school teachers acting as the forge to both create the worker bees we need , as well as the best [ and most successful ] by trying to destroy them ?
Thoughts ?
I 'll admit that my first reaction to this news was , " Who cares ? "
Of all the critters imperiled by human activity , why worry about the ones that persistently commit mass suicide ?
Except that it turns out that lemmings do not , in fact , intentionally hurl themselves into the sea .
It 's a myth .
Yes , the northern rodents have experienced periodic population booms , prompting them to migrate en masse to new territory , sometimes drowning or being trampled along the way .
But not deliberately .
The lemming , like every other animal , tends to prefer being alive .
Apparently , the myth took hold with the 1958 Disney documentary " White Wilderness . "
Instead of shooting an actual migration , the filmmakers took it upon themselves to transport a few dozen lemmings to a riverbank in Alberta , Canada , a landlocked province where the animals are not native .
They then tossed the rodents off a cliff into the " sea " and filmed them as they drowned , thus propagating a persistent urban legend .
You can watch the clip on YouTube .
For its efforts , the allegedly pro-rodent studio won an Oscar for Best Documentary .
But now the Arctic arvicolines are facing a threat even more menacing than Disney 's filmmakers : global warming .
According to Reuters , a study of Norwegian lemmings from 1970 has found that the creature 's periodic population spikes , which normally occur every three to five years , ended in 1994 .
Warmer temperatures , say the study 's authors , have created wetter snow , which makes it more difficult for the lemmings burrow into it to reach food and avoid predators .
Their study appears in the current issue of Nature .
It would be bad enough if it were just the lemmings that were dying off , but their absence is being felt throughout Norway 's ecosystems .
Populations of Arctic foxes and snowy owls have depended on lemming booms for food , and now they are turning to other animals , such as the grouse ( a bird that , contrary to another widespread myth , does not make frequent , petty complaints ) .
Norway 's lemmings , foxes , and owls are still far from going extinct , but it 's only getting worse : Reuters notes that late winter and early spring temperatures in southeastern Norway in recent decades are the highest since records began in 1756 .
As the north pole continues to warm , the fragility of Arctic ecosystems is becoming ever more unmistakable .
Far from being a frozen wasteland , the lands to the north are home to a finely tuned arrangement of water , soil , plants , animals , chemicals , and microbes that , when disrupted even slightly , can lead to cascading failure .
I 'd use this as an opportunity to condemn reliance on fossil fuels , if only I could come up with a valid metaphor for mindlessly marching toward disaster .
O'Reilly looks like he 's about to have an aneurysm as he tries to pin the mortgage meltdown on Barney Frank .
A snippet of the insanity :
i Phone users : Click to watch
O'REILLY : You said it 's not the best right now , but going forward this is going to be solid .
FRANK : Right ...
O'REILLY : People lost millions .
FRANK : I did n't say solid , I did n't say swell .
You distort consistently .
And you think ranting and raving ...
O'REILLY : All right .
FRANK : ... you do n't want to talk about 1994 , like no history is relevant .
The fact is that you had a problem with an administration -- conservative .
( CROSSTALK )
O'REILLY : I know , it 's all the conservatives , it 's all the Republicans and not you .
FRANK : Oh , come on .
O'REILLY : None on you .
That 's a joke .
FRANK : You wo n't have a rational discussion .
O'REILLY : That 's a joke .
FRANK : The joke is to think I could have a rational discussion with you .
You 're ranting .
E6 is a variant of Dungeons & Dragons v3.5 that challenges one of the game ’s basic assumptions :
What if there were only six levels instead of at least 20 ?
And why would you want to play this way ?
Lately , I ’m looking at E6 as a possible solution to the problems I have with D&D 3e and 4e .
For example , at high level in third edition D&D , combat is slow because characters have a lot of abilities and resources to choose from and opponents have lots of hit points .
In 4th edition , this privilege is now extended to even low - level characters !
In fact , it was an intentional part of D&D 4e ’s design to cut out the low - powered early levels that form E6 .
The idea was that D&D 3.5 had a “ sweet spot ” between levels 6 and 15 , where characters were tough and had a lot of resources but were n’t invulnerable .
4e starts you out with enough hit points and powers to ensure your character ’s survival , cutting out the low - level experience .
It ’s exactly this gritty low level content that forms the basis of E6 .
In a way , it ’s the anti-4e .
A world of six levels
For me , one of the most interesting things is how the world changes when everything in it is scaled for sixth level characters .
There are no Elminsters or Mordenkainens , no epic - level characters raising questions like , “ Why do adventurers risk their lives saving the world when there ’s a council of 20th level wizards who can stop any villain with ease ? ”
There are no spells above 3rd level , because there ’s no such thing in this world as a spellcaster powerful enough to cast them .
Anyone who can even master 3rd level spells like fireball is considered an archmage .
Nobody can create a magic sword of greater than +2 , and if a +3 sword exists it ’s considered an artifact .
And , generally , there are few monsters of high level , with a CR10 dragon posing an epic threat .
For the average peasant , even a single ogre is a serious danger , and that ’s how E6 sees it .
There ’s better realism , too .
You never become so powerful that you can routinely survive 200 foot drops or take on an army solo .
Characters remain human .
Porblem Sloved
But it ’s not all philosophical - E6 offers to solve practical problems .
My number one problem with D&D v3.5 was that high level play bogs down under the weight of options and character survivability , and 4e did nothing to improve that for me .
E6 never gets to the high levels , so you never get that issue .
Character generation is swift , and this lets DMs challenge their players better .
I think this is extremely important .
You do n’t have to pull punches or obssess over encounter balance , because if a PC is killed it wo n’t take too long to roll a new one .
This in turn makes player decisions more meaningful , and players can be satisfied that they won because of their own ingenuity and not because the encounter was balanced that way or the DM was afraid to kill off their PC .
Quick preparation helps the DM too .
Generating a complete stat block for an NPC takes very little time .
Our old epic level campaign ground to a halt because of how long it took the DM to roll up each 25th - level villain - and we ’d defeat it in about two combat turns .
The six level cap is also good for running mini-campaigns .
You might run a slow forum game or find that your group can only meet infrequently , so a full twenty or thirty level campaign will never finish .
It ’s also good if you want to plan a campaign in advance but find that writing twenty levels is too much work and takes too long to get to the interesting part .
But why E6 ?
While there are other gritty , rules - light D&D variants out there , E6 has one big advantage : it literally is just D&D 3.5 with a level cap .
This means you have access to a wealth of resources : the free Hypertext D20 SRD , about eight years ’ worth of official and unofficial expansion books , and a very large player base .
The basics of running E6 are obvious ( start a D&D 3.5 campaign and stop at level 6 ) , but if you ’re interested you ’ll want to start with the official ENWorld thread from 2007 .
This goes into detail about the philosophy of E6 and gives extra rules and guidelines , such as E6 - specific feats and a rule for advancing level 6 characters using bonus feats .
DKos ’s DavidKC :
Well , it looks like the candidate in this election who will be the ultimate uniter wo n’t by Barack Obama but Sarah Palin .
Yesterday I was booowled over to learn that some rabid , rabid Republicans who live in rural Missouri now agree with me on one thing :
They hate Sarah Palin .
Hate her .
The final nail was Thursday night ’s VP debate … .
It turns out that they really , really , really , really did not like the fact that Palin flat out did not answer many of the questions .
They found that to be outrageous .
After all , the entire reason they were watching the debate was to see her answer questions , doggone it .
They also did not like all her attempts to be folksy .
To them it just came off as , um , I think the word they used was “ phony . ”
In fact , the candidate who seemed to them to be real and more like them was not Sarah Palin but Joe Biden .
The women , in particularly , did not like Palin ’s flirty , winky act .
That went over like a lead balloon .
And both the men and the women did not like her “ Can I Call You Joe ” schtick .
They found that to be disrespectful to Senator Biden .

The deal will give India access to US civilian nuclear technology US President George W Bush has signed into law a nuclear deal with India , which ends a three - decade ban on US nuclear trade with Delhi .
The landmark agreement was approved by the US Congress nearly a week ago .
The deal will give India access to US civilian nuclear technology and fuel in return for inspections of its civilian , but not military , nuclear facilities .
India says the accord is vital to meet its rising energy needs .
Critics say it creates a dangerous precedent .
They say it effectively allows India to expand its nuclear power industry without requiring it to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) as other nations must .
The US restricted nuclear co-operation with India after it tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
' Natural partners '
At a White House signing ceremony , President Bush said : " This agreement sends a signal to the world : Nations that follow the path to democracy and responsible behaviour will find a friend in the United States of America . "
He said : " Even though the United States and India are separated by half the globe , we are natural partners as we head into the 21st Century . "
NUCLEAR POWER IN INDIA India has 14 reactors in commercial operation and nine under construction Nuclear power supplies about 3 % of India 's electricity By 2050 , nuclear power is expected to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity India has limited coal and uranium reserves
Its huge thorium reserves - about 25 % of the world 's total - are expected to fuel its nuclear power programme long - term Source : Uranium Information Center
Indian firms eye nuclear business
The US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , and Indian Foreign Minister , Pranab Mukherjee , are expected to formally sign the overall bilateral nuclear co-operation accord on Friday .
It was first agreed three years ago and is regarded as a key foreign policy priority for both the Indian and US governments .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh has said the deal will help India to liberate itself from " the constraints of technology denial of 34 years " .
Although India has said it retains the right to conduct nuclear tests , the US has said the deal would be cancelled in such an eventuality .
The US Senate approved the deal in a 86 - 13 vote last week .
The House of Representatives earlier passed the agreement by 298 - 117 votes .
The Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) recently lifted a ban that had denied India access to the international nuclear market .
India and France have also signed a major co-operation pact which paves the way for the sale of French nuclear reactors to Delhi .
France is the world 's second largest producer of nuclear energy after the United States .
Russia has also been lobbying the Indian government hard on behalf of its firms .

What are these ?
Natural selection favors the intelligent .
The evidence is right here in our civilization .
We are smarter than our distant ancestors , Australopithecus , Homo erectus , Cro-Magnon — that is a given .
The question is , did intelligence evolve because the smarter members of the population could avoid getting killed off ?
In prehistoric times , this would involve finding the best foods and avoiding enemies ; in modern times this means staying in shape , not smoking , and avoiding violent lifestyles .
Or were intelligent people more likely to reproduce because they attracted mates ?
We all know intelligence is sexy , but has it always been so ?
Or are intelligence , health , and reproductive ability linked genetically , even before the connection to behavior ?
As reported in The Economist , a study led by Rosalind Arden of King ’s College in London might bring us a tad closer to the answer .
Her team analyzed data taken in 1985 from 435 Vietnam veterans that included intelligence scores based on Spearman ’s g AND sperm samples that were tested at the time for sperm count , concentration , and motility .
Ms Arden found 425 cases where samples had been collected and analysed from unvasectomised men who had managed to avoid spilling their seed during the collection process and had answered all the necessary questions for her to test her hypothesis , namely that their g values would correlate with all three measures of their sperm quality .
They did .
Moreover , neither age nor any obvious confounding variable that might have been a consequence of intelligent decisions about health ( obesity , smoking , drinking and drug use ) had any effect on the result .
Brainy men , it seems , do have better sperm .
This does n’t tell us what caused the correlation .
Vietnam veterans are , intelligent or not , the product of millions of years of natural selection .
There may be something deep in our limbic systems that causes us to seek out intelligent mates when we can get them , at least someone more intelligent than our prehistoric ancestors , for childbearing purposes .
Or the traits may have been linked genetically many generations ago , and continue no matter who mates with who , because people of below average intelligence are still reproducing ( which explains why you often feel surrounded by idiots ) .
The Economist article posits the possibility that intelligence is just another manifestation of general healthiness , as is sperm count and attractiveness as a mate .
Better specimens are just plain better specimens all over .
Still , it ’s nice to know that brainy men have better sperm .
Should you ever be in a position to use that as a pickup line , it ’s available with citable research .

Google does n't need to partner with Yahoo to eat away at Yahoo 's market share in search .
That 's what YouTube is for .
In August , YouTube became the second most popular search engine , essentially bumping Yahoo into third place .
And now Google is introducing search ads to the site .
Ads for Oliver Stone 's new movie " W. , " the University of Phoenix , Simple Shoes , and Home Depot now appear alongside certain search terms .
Says AdAge :
" If the targeting in that example seems less than relevant , it 's because the pool of advertisers is small as YouTube beta tests the format .
Ad
Age has also heard quality controls are under development to bring the format more in line with Google 's regular search ads , in which placement is a combination of quality score and bid price . "
YouTube received almost 2.6 billion searches in August , compared to Yahoo's 2.4 billion , according to ComScore .
Video searches are not as easily commoditized as text searches — viewers are often looking for entertainment and information more than purchases — so YouTube search ads are n't likely to generate as much money as Google 's AdWords , but that sounds like cold comfort for a company like Yahoo .
Pamela Davis , blond suburban mother of three , was told that her bra would be the best place to wear the wire that kick - started a long investigation into Chicago graft and that ultimately caught the governor of Illinois trying to sell Barack Obama ’s Senate seat .
Davis is the president and C.E.O. of Edward Hospital , in Naperville , Illinois .
She is proud of the fact that on her twenty - year watch the hospital has grown from a hundred - and - sixty - two - bed community facility to a four - hundred - and - twenty - seven - bed regional medical center that leads the county in babies delivered .
Back in 2003 , Davis was trying to get approval for a new medical office building from the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board .
A night or two before a hearing was to be held , Davis recalled , something strange happened .
A business acquaintance of hers , Nicholas Hurtgen , then a managing director of the Chicago office of Bear Stearns , called her at home and told her that unless she agreed to use a certain contractor she should pull her building request , because it was n’t going to be approved .
She ignored the warning and went off to the board hearing , where she was surprised to find that her request was denied .
“ I was humiliated , ” she said .
“ They were mean .
So I walk off , and then a different guy comes up to me and he says , ‘ We told you to pull your project .
Call me . ’
And right then I decided to call the F.B.I. ”
At first , the agents she contacted thought she was a crank .
“ I could tell they were laughing at me .
Most people who call the F.B.I. are crazies .
So they sort of humored me and said , ‘ O.K. , we will come out and listen once . ’ ”
A few days later , three F.B.I. agents met her at her office , bugged her phone , and outfitted her with the wire to put in her bra .
Then they set up camp in a van in the parking garage and waited .
“ They said , ‘ You tell nobody anything , not even your husband . ’
They were laughing at me and I was laughing at them . ”
The agents had instructed Davis to invite Hurtgen and Jacob Kiferbaum , the contractor whom he had mentioned over the phone , to meet at her office .
When they arrived , the F.B.I. men listened in on the conversation from the van .
As Davis recalled , “ They say , ‘ We told you to pull the project . ’
And I say , ‘ Yeah , why do I need you ? ’
And they start saying , ‘ If you do n’t hire us , you will never get this project approved . ’
After about five minutes , my phone rings , and now the three F.B.I. guys in the parking garage are saying , ‘ It ’s extortion !
It ’s extortion ! ’
They yell , ‘ Get ’em out !
Get ’em out !’
So I hang up the phone .
“ Now everybody is looking at me .
These guys have driven two hours to have a meeting with me .
And I say to them , ‘ I am so sorry , I have a family emergency . ’
I ’m making this up as I go along .
After that , I had the three stooges in the garage telling me they ’d help me . ”
That episode helped start United States Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald ’s Operation Board Games .
For the next seven months , Pamela Davis , hospital administrator , became Pamela Davis , secret agent , helping to expose a multimillion - dollar scam that at times resembled a spinoff of “ The Sopranos , ” guest - starring the back office from “ Grey ’s Anatomy . ”
Davis attended long lunches and boozy dinners with crooked businessmen , listening ( and taping ) as they talked of grafting off the hospital industry .
She would slip the tapes to her F.B.I. handlers at Marshall Field ’s makeup counters in malls around suburban Chicago .
Davis taped all sorts of incriminating conversations , but she never quite got used to spycraft .
“ The wire is a little tiny square thing I put inside my bra .
I thought it would fall out all the time , ” she said .
“ Oh , the logistics of getting this stuff done !
One morning , I had to meet one of the F.B.I. guys in my office at 6 A.M. so he could hook up a wire to tap my phone .
He was under my desk , on the floor .
It looks kinky !
My administrative assistant pops her head in , and there ’s this man under my desk , and she says , ‘ Oh , my goodness , ’ and leaves .
And I go , ‘ What am I supposed to tell her ? ’
He says , ‘ I do n’t know .
That never happened to me before . ’ ”
Eventually , the “ bad guys , ” as Davis calls them , told her she could build her new building if she agreed to add several million dollars to the deal for Kiferbaum .
“ The F.B.I. said , ‘ Sign it — it makes the case better . ’
But I could n’t do that .
How could I possibly sign something like that and cost my organization money ?
I did n’t know what the hell to do . ”
( The F.B.I. was unable to comment . )
Davis got a court order allowing her to hire a lawyer and to tell her hospital - board chairman what she was up to .
After seven months , the Chicago Sun-Times published her name in a blind item about an ongoing corruption investigation , and Davis ’s role in the case was over .
Her tapes of Stuart Levine , a corrupt health - board member , helped lead to his becoming a federal witness in the trial of Antoin ( Tony ) Rezko .
( Kiferbaum pleaded guilty to attempted extortion in 2005 .
Hurtgen maintains his innocence , and his lawyer disputed Davis ’s account . )
As Fitzgerald ’s probe widened , more wiretaps were put in place , and more corruption was exposed .
Eventually , the governor of Illinois was recorded discussing the sale of Obama ’s Senate seat .
Davis , who describes herself as a political independent , says she ’s disgusted with politics now , although she did vote for Obama .
And she still has n’t received state approval for her hospital expansion . ♦
Barack Obama says he wants to move quickly on Guantanamo Bay US Defense Secretary Robert Gates has ordered plans to be drafted for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention centre , the Pentagon says .
A team was looking at moving inmates from the facility in a way that continued to protect the American people , a spokesman said .
About 250 detainees remain in the controversial Cuba camp .
US President - elect Barack Obama says closing the camp " in a responsible way " is one of his top priorities .
Mr Obama , who takes office on 20 January , said earlier this week he aimed to close the facility within two years .
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Mr Gates - who is to retain his position in the new administration - had wanted to be prepared in case Mr Obama wished to tackle the issue " early in his tenure " .
" He has asked his team for a proposal on how to shut it down , what will be required specifically to close it and move the detainees from that facility , and at the same time protect the American people from dangerous terrorists , " he said .
New legal process
The Guantanamo Bay prison opened shortly after the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
Hundreds of men suspected of links to terrorism or al - Qaeda were held without trial as " unlawful enemy combatants " .
Many are now challenging their detention in civilian courts , after a ruling in June by the US Supreme Court .
Some officials have warned that closing the camp would be an extremely complicated process .
Those still detained there include men alleged to have planned the 9/11 attacks .
How and where they would be detained or tried in the future simply is not clear , reports the BBC's Adam Brookes from Washington .
The incoming president , the Department of Justice and perhaps Congress will need to build a whole new legal process for handling the remaining Guantanamo detainees , our correspondent says .

To understand the machinations of a complex world , one must become sensitive to how apparently separate phenomena interconnect to produce unexpected consequences .
Otherwise intelligent men and women struggle to make sense of the destructive turbulence that is fast becoming the norm in modern society .
Wars that fail to satisfy even the most meager of excuses for their prosecution ; rapidly - expanding police states rationalized as necessary for the ferreting out of " terrorist " bogeymen ; state - sponsored torture conducted for no more apparent purpose than an end in itself ; the wholesale looting engaged in — with bipartisan support — for the purpose of creating trillions of dollars of booty to subsidize the corporate owners of American society for losses sustained through incompetent management ; these are the major examples of the failure to see interrelated causes of social disorder .
Throughout all of this , we see exhibited by those who presume the powers of omniscience and rational planning , a thorough ignorance not only of the causal factors that continue to produce our horribly disrupted world , but of the propriety of statist actions that respond to such dislocations with the same mindset that produced the turmoil .
One sees symptoms of this disconnectedness in such absurdities as Al Gore ’s receipt of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize , or the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman .
It is as though the Nobel Prize judges wanted to go out of their collective way to refute Einstein ’s proposition that one cannot solve a problem with the same kind of thinking that produced it !
Another example of ultra-myopic thinking is to be found in a recent editorial from the erstwhile free - market publication , The Economist .
Focusing on the travails that beset economies throughout the world , the magazine advises : " This is a time to put dogma and politics to one side and concentrate on pragmatic answers .
That means more government intervention and co-operation in the short term than taxpayers , politicians or indeed free - market newspapers would normally like . "
Whenever I hear or read such arrant nonsense , I am reminded of my law school Jurisprudence professor , Karl Llewellyn ’s interchange with a classmate of mine who had challenged a statement of Llewellyn’s by saying : " that may be good in theory , but it is n’t practical . "
Llewellyn responded : " if it ’s not practical , it ’s not good theory . "
Much of the explanation for this disconnected mindset can be found in the " specialized " ways in which we learn and work .
Economists , lawyers , historians , scientists , et al. , are to learn and to practice a presumed " expertise " in their chosen field .
Each is to stick to his territory , and to defend the collective interests of his colleagues by attacking those who presume to speak or write in subject areas for which they do not hold graduate degrees .
This is the ultimate form of reductionist thinking , a travesty which , fortunately , is openly confronted by the holistic premises of chaos theory .
The world is simply too complex ; subject to a myriad of interconnected influences that are both unidentifiable and not confined to the tenets of any academic discipline .
So many of our current difficulties are underlain by the kind of unfocused , fragmented thinking expressed in The Economist editorial .
" Pragmatism " has no meaning in the absence of ends to be served ; objectives that necessarily incorporate explicit or implicit values of the actor .
One who seeks " pragmatic answers " to problems — without addressing the principles by which " answers " are to be evaluated — is engaged in the smuggling of hidden premises into the discussion .
If people act to be better off afterwards than they were before , what criteria and purposes will motivate their actions ?
In our commercially - dominant culture , it is too often assumed that material values pre-empt all others , an assumption that seems to direct almost all of the proposals offered in response to the economic turbulence now besetting both America and the rest of the world .
As one who regards the industrial revolution as the most humanizing period in history , I unequivocally acknowledge that material values are important to pursue .
While such ends are necessary for living well , they are not sufficient .
Let any who doubt this inform me of the value of a baby , or the costs associated with Nazi concentration camps or Soviet gulags !
Materialistic thinking that is separated from other values dominates proposals for dealing with the current economic collapse .
Politicians and media voices speak in terms of numbers , but not much else .
Congress ’ giving of trillions of dollars to banks is defended on the grounds that " it will strengthen their balance sheets . "
Of course it will , just as a mugger will have more money in his pockets after a night of robbery .
But at whose cost ?
" Will this work ? " is another commonly - asked question , reflecting the same kind of morally bankrupt questioning with which most address the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , or the propriety of torture .
If , as seems to be the case , Western civilization is in a state of collapse , we might have occasion to consider the causes so that we might rethink our assumptions — and behavior — for whatever is to follow .
The well - being of any system depends upon more than just its material characteristics .
A vibrant business organization , for instance , requires more than abundant investment capital .
Whether the firm ’s decision - making is centralized in an individual who issues directives to underlings , or is decentralized among those who perform the work of the organization , will have much to do with determining how much creativity and job satisfaction will be fostered .
Likewise , the well - being of a family depends on more than the principal wage - earner bringing money home for the purchase of goods and services .
In the same way , the prosperity of a society — or a civilization — requires much more than the generation of material wealth .
All dynamic systems depend upon the integration of life - sustaining influences .
For the same reason , the disintegration of such qualities helps to bring about the demise of systems .
This is what is meant by living with integrity : interacting with others , holistically , from within a non-contradictory center on the basis of values and principles that sustain one ’s well - being .
Our ancestors seem to have had an intuitive awareness of the importance of living the integrated life .
The search of an etymological dictionary reveals that the words " peace , " " freedom , " " love , " and " friend , " share some common origins .
Perhaps they implicitly understood what we , in our overly - politicized world , can no longer grasp , namely , that " friends " express " love " for one another by respecting one another ’s " freedom , " and that a world so constituted enjoys " peace . "
How impractical , we tell ourselves , as we play out the violent , conflict - ridden premises in which our thinking has been carefully structured .
What masses of contradiction have we become when we condemn young men who kill their classmates at school , while cheering those who kill strangers in foreign lands ; when we are unable to see that " our representatives " in Washington , D.C. are treating us no differently than is the mugger we encounter in a dark alley ?
It has become fashionable to speak of the impending bankruptcy of the American economic system .
To so focus our attention , however , is to overlook the fragmented nature of what we have allowed ourselves to become .
Economic bankruptcy does not arise independently of related factors .
The seeds of such bankruptcy were planted long ago , and have been carefully tended to by subsequent generations .
There is a more generalized bankruptcy whose disintegrative influences have combined to produce our impending collapse .
The first of such causal forces can be referred to as moral bankruptcy , a phrase intended to cut much deeper than the kinds of personal habits and lifestyle concerns that get conservatives agitated .
I refer , instead , to the willingness of so many of us to rationalize the taking of the unearned from owners and bestowing it upon others , provided the process is stamped with the imprimatur of the state .
This shortcoming also finds expression amongst those who sanction the conduct of wars , or who have no problem devoting their energies to designing or operating military weapons and other systems for monitoring or controlling the actions of people .
A most troubling expression of moral bankruptcy is reflected in the aforementioned editorial from The Economist : the failure to live an integrated , centered life has pragmatic consequences .
Moral and philosophic principles have the most practical implications for the very existence of our lives .
Stated another way , the refusal to integrate moral and philosophic principles in one ’s life is the reflection of a principle , albeit one that is deftly smuggled into a discussion in service to unstated ends .
Upon close examination , however , one discovers that the disguised principle is one that fragments rather than integrates one ’s life , producing destructive conflict rather than wholeness .
Intellectual bankruptcy has been another major contributor to our socially disordered world .
The failure to understand the nature of economics , and the principles of causation and conservation of both mass and energy ; the failure to respect the inviolability of property rights and contracts ; as well as an ignorance of history , have been additional catalysts for our present disarray .
Politicians who ought to have learned from recent history about the destructive effects of inflation and the stultifying nature of state socialism , responded to an immediate crisis by generating more than $ 1,000,000,000,000 of additional inflation and partially socializing banks !
In so doing , Congress was unable to rise above the habit at which it has proven itself adept , namely , to print more debased currency and bestow it upon its corporate friends .
As in the aftermath to 9/11 , its reaction was one of reflexive desperation rather than considered analysis ; like blind men throwing darts at a dart - board .
As our entropic decline continues , the politicos generate no more intelligent purpose than to preach the need for " economic stabilization " ( i.e. , to maintain the status quo ) .
The intellectual insolvency of our culture has been demonstrated in the response of many politicians and news media people to the McCain / Palin charge that Obama is a " socialist . "
No doubt such allegations are correct — so , too , of course , does the accusation apply to McCain — but notice the response thereto .
Were " socialism " to become an issue in this campaign , news reporters , commentators , and political hacks , would have to be prepared to analyze its philosophic , historic , and economic implications .
One would have to have a mind versed in intellectual concepts , and such are not part of the curricula of journalism departments .
The " debate " must thus be shifted to a safe topic about which no challenges to the mind can arise : Sarah Palin ’s wardrobe !
One anti-conceptual group went so far as to try to equate criticism of " socialism " as an expression of racism !
The confusion about socialistic thinking and government regulation has been aided by the collapse of respect for the principle of privately - owned property .
This , in turn , has been abetted by what Joseph Schumpeter identified as the movement from owner - controlled to manager - controlled business firms .
This transformation has produced a shift in perspective from longer - term to shorter - term decision - making .
I encountered this tendency when , in law practice , I witnessed owners of businesses considering the impact their actions might have on their children and grandchildren who might one day own their enterprises , while managers — whom Schumpeter correctly characterized as having the mindset of employees — tended to focus the scope of their actions only upon immediate concerns .
Politicians and bureaucrats typify such thinking , looking only to the next election or their retirement to define their time - frames .
We need to move beyond the kind of thinking that drives political systems .
Governmental policies are like so much of traditional medicine that only covers up symptoms without treating the underlying disease .
If Americans have any hope of restoring a vibrant , productive economy , we need all the destabilization we can muster .
President Bush babbled such incoherencies as how state socialism will preserve a free market — words that recall the Vietnam War illogic about " destroying a village in order to save it . "
With such thinking directing economic policies in Washington , you can be assured that institutionalized foolishness is what will end up being stabilized .
It is the spiritual bankruptcy of our culture that is most in need of recovery ; a " bailout " that can be accomplished only by mobilizing the inner resources of individuals .
This is a topic I more thoroughly discussed elsewhere .
The regeneration of the human spirit can arise only from a person ’s believing in his or her existential worthiness ; to regard the individual , in Kant ’s words , " always as an end and never as a means only . "
It is only in the power of individuals to transcend their experiences and formal learning that a society can be rejuvenated .
As we rediscover our individuality and withdraw our energies from the collective abstractions to which we have attached ourselves , our personal and social integrity will no longer be in destructive contradiction .
As institutional interests struggle to overcome their terminal fate , there is a wonderful opportunity for each of us to reinvest in ourselves and , in so doing , help our world to become human - centered .
The corporate , political , academic , and media voices will continue to condemn our " selfishness " even as they insist upon satisfying their appetites for greed and power .
But the creative and orderly forces of chaos will prevail — they always have .
When Alan Greenspan testified , a few days ago , that he did n’t see the economic crisis coming , he was unwittingly admitting to anyone ’s incapacities to make predictions in the face of complexity .
" Neither all the king ’s horses nor all the kings men " — with all of the violence , paper money , or prisons available to them — can achieve by indirection , political magic , or other quickie solutions to long - term problems , what you and I , alone , can accomplish by introspection .
Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed our present situation quite well : " This time , like all other times , is a very good one , if only we know what to do with it . "

They 've tried noisy protests , consumer boycotts , and the odd act of minor terrorism .
Now supporters of gay marriage have unveiled a new weapon in their war against the Mormon Church : satire .
The creators of the cartoon South Park , Trey Parker and Matt Stone , are planning to stage a Broadway musical based on the lives and ( many ) loves of typical members of the Church of the Latter Day Saints .
It will be co-written by the composer Robert Lopez , who wrote Avenue Q , the award - winning musical which sends - up another all - American institution , Sesame Street .

Cheyenne Jackson , an openly - gay Broadway star who appeared in the film United 93 , said this week that he has agreed to play the lead role , a Mormon missionary , in the show , which is currently being work - shopped and is slated to open in 2009 .
" It 's hilarious : very acerbic and biting , " he told the New York Post .
" It offends everybody , but does what South Park does best , which is [ that ] by the end it comes around and has something great to say . "
Though he did n't reveal details of the plot , or say who else would be starring in the show , Jackson added that it has the working title of Mormon Musical .
" I play the main missionary , Elder something , " he said .
News of the potentially - controversial project comes at a tough time for the Mormon Church , which is fighting a propaganda war over its role in passing Proposition 8 , the ballot measure that outlawed same - sex weddings in California this month .
The Church joined a coalition of religious groups supporting the Proposition , and members donated tens of millions of dollars to finance a raft of often - misleading attack adverts , which helped persuade 52.5 percent of the State 's electorate to support the measure .
A series of noisy protests have since targeted Mormon temples , and church property across America has been vandalised .
On Friday , two temples in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City , the home of Mormonism , were at the centre of an Anthrax scare , after being sent envelopes containing white powder .
Activists in Hollywood , the centre of LA 's gay community , have urged their supporters in the world of show - business to back a consumer boycott of companies that helped finance the gay marriage ban .

The Sundance Film Festival , which begins in January , is particularly threatened by the boycott , since it takes place in the Utah ski resort of Park City , just a short drive from Salt Lake City .
Actors and producers have been urged to pull their films from a Cinemark Theatres complex providing four screening rooms to the Festical .
The company 's CEO , Alan Stock , contributed $ 9,999 to the Yes on 8 campaign .
Campaigners have already forced the resignation of Scott Eckern , artistic director of the Sacramento Musical Theater , who donated $ 1,000 , and are calling for Rich Raddon , director of the Los Angeles Film Festival and another donor , to also be fired .
Whatever Mormon Musical 's eventual contents , the creators of South Park certainly have form for offending religious minorities .
One of their cast members , the late Isaac Hayes , quit the show in 2006 over what he described as its " bigoted " portrayal of Scientology .
Their 1999 film Bigger , Longer and UnCut attacked both Saddam Hussein and the people of Canada , and sailed close to the wind dealing with the issue of race .
However it was shortlisted for an Oscar for its soundtrack .
Jackson is active within the gay rights community .
His comments regarding the project were made an awards show organised by the gay magazine Out .
" As frustrating as Prop 8 has been , we have to look back at the last 60 years and see how far we 've come , " he added .

大きめなテストプログラムということで、すべてがSchemeで書かれているDorai Sitaramさんによる正規表現ライブラリ(pregexp.scm : Portable regular expressions for Scheme ) を使うことにします。高レベル
なAPIとしてはfutureを使うことにしました。これはJavaのfutureのようにexplicitなタイプで、次のように定義されています。
( define - syntax future ( syntax - rules ( ) ( ( _ e0 e1 ... ) ( let ( ( ans ( make - shared - queue ) ) ) ( call - with - spawn ( lambda ( ) e0 e1 ... ) ( lambda ( c ) ( unless ( condition ? c ) ( shared - queue - push ! ans c ) ) ( shared - queue - shutdown ans ) ) ) ( lambda timeout ( apply shared - queue - pop ! ans timeout ) ) ) ) ) )
futureはクロージャを返します。このクロージャを呼び出すことにより同期と結果の取得を行います。

California 's highest court has just agreed to hear legal challenges to a new ban on gay marriage , but has refused to allow gay couples to resume marrying until it rules .
The California Supreme Court on Wednesday accepted three lawsuits seeking to overturn Proposition 8 .
The amendment passed this month with 52 percent of the vote .
The court did not elaborate more on this decision .
Gay rights advocates in these case are arguing that the measure was actually a constitutional revision , instead of a more limited amendment .
A revision of the state Constitution can be placed before the voters only by a two - thirds vote of the Legislature or a constitutional convention .
Lawsuits to overturn the initiative contend it was a revision because it denied equal protection to a minority group and eviscerated a key constitutional guarantee .
Supporters of Proposition 8 counter that it merely amended the constitution by restoring a traditional definition of marriage .
In its order , the court established an expedited briefing schedule , under which briefing will be completed in January 2009 and oral argument potentially could be held as early as March 2009 .
Six justices — Chief Justice Ronald M. George , Justice Marvin R. Baxter , Justice Kathryn M. Werdegar , Justice Ming W. Chin , Justice Carlos R. Moreno , and Justice Carol A. Corrigan signed the court ’s order , but Justice Moreno indicated that he would grant the requests to stay the operation of Proposition 8 pending the court ’s resolution of these matters .
The court has tended to defer to voter sentiment on initiative challenges , but it has overturned popular ballot measures in the past .
In 1966 , the California Supreme Court struck down an initiative that would have permitted racial discrimination in housing .
Voters had approved the measure , a repeal of a fair housing law , by a 2 - to - 1 margin .
Opponents challenged measure on equal protection grounds , not as a constitutional revision .
Additionally Federal courts have also overturned another contentious initiative , Proposition 187 , the anti-immigration measure passed by voters .

MOSCOW , Nov. 15 ( UPI ) -- Russian authorities say no one was injured Saturday when vandals blew up a statue of Lenin in Ryazan .
The bomb contained an estimated 200 grams of the explosive TNT , reported RIA Novosti .

" As a result of the blast , the 2 - meter ( 2 - yard ) alabaster monument was completely destroyed .
An investigation is being carried out , " a police source told the Russian news agency .
Last month , police in the Volga city of Nizhny Novgorod arrested a " slightly drunk " man as he tried to pull the head off a statue of Lenin , who organized the Bolshevik Revolution , RIA Novosti reported , noting the man succeeded only in tearing off Lenin 's right arm .
Lenin 's embalmed body has been on display in a glass case in Moscow 's Red Square since his death in 1924 .
Protests against his continued presence have escalated throughout the former Soviet Union since its breakup in 1991 .
僕は簿記の素人。僕はプログラマ。僕の実家は建築業。だから実家にある簿記の本に教わりながら頑張って理解した。
プログラムの開発を工事進行基準会計に変えなきゃならないらしい。
このような進行基準会計を導入すると、上場ソフトウェア業界はとても助かる。オレはすばらしいアイディアだと思った。
ゲームソフト開発・映画開発、そして建築業界。はこの恩恵を上手に生かしている・。
そもそも工事進行基準って何なんだろう。拙い会計の知識で頑張って理解した。1年前の話。
工業簿記というのがある 普通の簿記 受注⇒仕入⇒販売 工業簿記 受注⇒原材料仕入⇒生産・工事⇒販売 が大きな違い。ポイントは加工費用を持っているということ。
加工品を簿記でどう表現するか 加工品は次の価値で表現される。 加工品 ＝ 原材料 ＋ 人件費（工賃） 加工品を販売して売り上げた場合は 売上 ＝ （材料費）＋加工費用 ＋利益 になる。 ここでややこしいのが工事費用。受注から納品までが1ヶ月程度の加工で在れば通常の簿記と同様に扱える。２年、３年になるとどうするのか。ここがポイント
加工中・生産中の商品を資産計上しておかないと大変
使った人件費がまるまる赤字になってしまう。これでは国税局は徴税できない。株式会社なら株主に会計期間の会計が正しく伝わらない。 仕掛品を使う
うちの実家の建築関係の場合 仕掛品＝未成工事支出金 ソフトウェア業界であれば、開発中のプログラム。
何でこんな事をするのか。 無い頭をひねって考えた。このような場合の会計処理が大変だからだ。

２年掛けて開発してきて納品直前に納品先が倒産した。

工事が終わるまで、持ち出し超過になる。自転車操業に陥りやすい。
これはゲームソフトでた例えるとわかりやすい。
３年、１０億かけてゲームソフト超大作を作る ４年目に大ヒット、１２億の売上げ １億赤字です。これって変だよね。
１２億の売上げに対する法人税は３億程度。手元に９億残りました。差し引き赤字。
で、実際にどうやるか 数年にわたるプロジェクトを運営している業界は、映画と建設業だね。 映画・アニメは○○制作委員会 巨大建設 はＪＶ方式 どちらもプロジェクト法人を作ってそこで管理している。 どちらの業界も似た方式で管理している。受注資金や発注、納期管理をプロジェクト毎に行っている。
特に元請け、子受け孫請け、ひ孫・・・とややこしく、参加者が多い場合はこちらが好まれるようです。
LinuxとGNUがこれを加速させる・ Ｌｉｎｕｘ採用とかは１社に丸投げを阻害するので、ＪＶ方式が加速するんじゃないかな。
ＩＴ業界も、派遣、受託、客先常駐・・・参加者増えて、この方式になっていくんじゃないかと。
支払いのタイミングをどうするんだろう。 建築なら簡単 １０ Ｆ マンション の１ 階ずつ支払う 映画も簡単 全シーンのうち何％の撮影と編集が終わったか
ＩＴは大変 全行程をどうやって把握するんだ。←いまここ
受託開発も同じ流れだろう なんかＩＴにおける工事進行基準がどうとうか、子会社までの管理を徹底するとか、見積もりも支払いの対象になるとか、そんなおいしいことをいってる本も多いけれど。
中小の建築業は今でも見積もり、仕様策定はサービスだよ
ＩＴ業界だからと言って見積もりにコスト発生なんて慣習的に無理なんだろう。

Trilateral Commission co-founder and top Obama advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski told CNN yesterday that Barack Obama would be faced with “ imminent problems ” in the context of foreign policy once he takes office , echoing prophetic warnings made recently by Joe Biden , Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright .
Appearing on CNN ’s Global Public Square with host Fareed Zakaria , Brzezinski said that President Carter contacted him to ask who he should appoint to different posts after he captured the White House , perhaps a hint that Obama might do the same .
“ The president at one point called me , and rather cleverly asked me who I thought ought to occupy what posts .
And I gave him advice .
And I finally came to the post of national security adviser , ” said Brzezinski , adding that Carter offered him the position .
Zakaria asked Brzezinski if the president - elect should “ start sending signals to foreign governments ” .
“ I think it depends on two things — one , on the nature of the president himself , and , two , on the circumstances , ” Brzezinski responded .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ I think what is going on right now — which is nothing less than a global crisis of American leadership , nothing less than that —
I think the president - elect , whoever he is — and I have my own preference — will have to start sending signals right away , and will have to get ready to deal with some imminent problems . ”
Brzezinski’s warning that Obama will face immediate problems in the form of a foreign policy crisis echoes similar sentiments expressed by Obama ’s running mate , Senator Joe Biden , who last month told an audience in Seattle “ We ’re gonna have an international crisis , a generated crisis , to test the mettle of this guy . ”
Biden was vehement in his proclamation , stating that it was a “ guarantee ” and a “ promise ” that Obama would face an international crisis and that “ tough ” and “ unpopular ” decisions would have to be made to combat it .
Colin Powell made similar statements when he endorsed Obama on Meet the Press , saying “ There ’s going to be a crisis which will come along on the 21st , 22nd of January that we do n’t even know about right now . ”
Former Secretary of State Madeline Albright also told CNN ’s John Roberts , “ It ’s just a statement of fact … something unexpected , you always have to be prepared for that . ”

Lisa Rinna : Red Carpet Vamp Act ( Photos )
Los Angeles Confidential magazine held a red carpet affair to publicize their annual all male issue .
Their cover guys for this edition areand .
Good for them but the real interest , from our perspective , was created by the amazingly hot women who graced the red carpet .
In our opinion , Lisa Rinna stole the runway with her antics .
Always willing to pose for the photogs , she does n't disappoint here .
Her good looking husband Harry Hamlin stands by looking nonplussed as she goes through her gyrations .

The vote could speed up the inquest of Azelle Rodney , opposition peers say The government has suffered another defeat in the House of Lords over its counter - terrorism proposals , this time over the use of intercept evidence .
Opposition peers united to pass an amendment calling on judges sitting as coroners to have access to sensitive evidence such as tapped phone calls .
The disclosure , at inquests , of details obtained via surveillance could hinder investigatory methods , ministers said .
Previous defeats came over DNA samples and detention of terrorist suspects .
' Big difference '
Ministers were forced to abandon controversial plans to increase the length of time suspected terrorists could be held without being charged from 28 to 42 days after a heavy defeat in the Lords .
It is unclear what impact the latest defeat over the type of evidence admissible at inquests will have as the amendment may be overturned when the bill returns to the Commons .
This small change can make a big difference to how we handle sensitive evidence at inquests in future
Baroness Miller
But the BBC's David Wilby said it could speed up several inquests , including that of Azelle Rodney who died after his car was stopped by armed police conducting a surveillance operation in 2005 .
The case was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service but no charges were brought against the Metropolitan Police .
A coroner said he could not hold a lawful inquest because of secret evidence which could not be made public .
Lib Dem peer Baroness Miller said the amendment would enable Azelle Rodney 's family and the relatives of those involved in similar incidents to get answers on why their loved ones had died .
" This small change can make a big difference to how we handle sensitive evidence at inquests in future , " she said .
" It will now be down to judges to decide how it is handled , not the police . "

( CNN ) --
A wall holding back 80 acres of sludge from a coal plant in central Tennessee broke this week , spilling more than 500 million gallons of waste into the surrounding area .
Environmental Protection Agency officials are on the scene and expect the cleanup to to take four to six weeks .
The sludge , a byproduct of ash from coal combustion , was contained at a retention site at the Tennessee Valley Authority 's power plant in Kingston , about 40 miles east of Knoxville , agency officials said .
The retention wall breached early Monday , sending the sludge downhill and damaging 15 homes .
All the residents were evacuated , and three homes were deemed uninhabitable , a TVA spokesman told CNN .
The plant sits on a tributary of the Tennessee River called the Clinch River .
" We deeply regret that a retention wall for ash containment at our Kingston Fossil Plant failed , resulting in an ash slide and damage to nearby homes , " TVA said in a statement released Tuesday .
TVA spokesman Gil Francis told CNN that up to 400 acres of land had been coated by the sludge , a bigger area than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill .
Video footage showed sludge as high as 6 feet , burying porches and garage doors .
The slide also downed nearby power lines , though the TVA said power had been restored to the area .
Francis said Environmental Protection Agency officials were on the scene and estimated the cleanup could take four to six weeks .
Some of the goop spilled into the tributary , but preliminary water quality tests show that the drinking water at a nearby treatment plant meets standards .
" I do n't want to drink it .
It does n't look healthy to me , " Jody Miles , who fishes in the Clinch River , told CNN affiliate WBIR .
" Do you reckon they can bring all this life back that 's going to die from all this mess ? "
Still , there is the potential for more sludge to enter the water supply through waste runoff .
" We 're taking steps to stabilize runoff from this incident , " Francis said .
Although video from the scene shows dead fish on the banks of the tributary , he said that " in terms of toxicity , until an analysis comes in , you can't call it toxic . "
One environmental attorney called that statement " irresponsible . "
The ash that gives sludge its thick , pudding - like consistency in this case is known as fly ash , which results from the combustion of coal .
Fly ash contains concentrated amounts of mercury , arsenic and benzine , said Chandra Taylor , staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center .
" These things are naturally occurring , but they concentrate in the burning process and the residual is more toxic than it starts , " she told CNN .
Appalachian environmentalists compared the mess with another spill eight years ago in eastern Kentucky , where the bottom of a coal sludge impoundment owned by Massey Energy broke into an abandoned underground mine , oozing more than 300 million gallons of coal waste into tributaries .
The water supply for more than 25,000 residents was contaminated , and aquatic life in the area perished .
It took months to clean up the spill .
" If the estimates are correct , this spill is one and a half times bigger , " said Dave Cooper , an environmental advocate with the Mountaintop Removal Road Show , a traveling program that explains the effect of an extreme form of mining .
While the full scope of the TVA spill is being determined , coal critics are already concerned about its long - term effects .
Cleaning up the mess , which could fill nearly 800 Olympic - size swimming pools , could take months or years , Taylor said .
" We 're very concerned about how long it 's going to take " to clean the spill , she told CNN .
Cooper agreed , saying , " It 's 4 , 5 feet deep .
How are you going to scoop it up ?
Where are you going to put it ? "

Thousands of protesters hurled stones and Molotov cocktails at police yesterday , as Greek police reportedly began to run out of teargas after a week of riots that have seen the streets of major cities turned into virtual war zones .
Police sources say they have used more than 4,600 teargas capsules in the past week and have contacted Israel and Germany for fresh stocks .
The prime minister , Costas Karamanlis , yesterday vowed to keep citizens safe , but students angry at the fatal shooting of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos by the police again attacked officers outside parliament .
" Alexi , these nights are yours , " says the graffiti on the subway wall , addressed to the Athens schoolboy killed last Saturday , allegedly by a police bullet .
The week of rioting and protest that has left the city in shards belongs , above all , to the young .
It is a revolt of schoolchildren and students , most on the streets for the first time .
There are reports of children as young as 12 battling riot police , shouting " Cops ! Pigs ! Murderers ! "
The teenagers and twenty - somethings who have come close to toppling the Greek government are not the marginalised : this is no replay of the riots that convulsed Paris in 2005 .
Many are sons and daughters of the middle classes , shocked at the killing of one of their own , disgusted with the government 's incompetence and corruption , enraged by the broken promises of the education system , scared at the prospect of having to work still harder than their exhausted parents .
Some call themselves the " €700 generation " in recognition of the wage they expect their degrees to get them .
The intensity of their fury has startled the whole country - including , perhaps , themselves .
Anarchist groups dreaming of revolution played a key part in the first waves of destruction , but this week 's protests were not orchestrated by the usual suspects , who relish a good bust - up and a whiff of teargas .
There 's been no siege of the American embassy , no blaming Bush , very few party slogans .
Though the spectacular violence has dominated the news , thousands have also set out to join in peaceful demonstrations , among them parents worried for their children 's future .
Linked by the internet , by twitter and text messages , many are trying to distance themselves from the destruction , which they attribute to " extremists , idiots and provocateurs " .
The demands of the young are hard to formulate .
They want an end to police violence ; they want to change things ; they want jobs , and hope ; they want a better system .
If the wish list is slightly vague , the problem itself is amorphous and difficult to name : a crisis of values and institutions , society and economy , vision and leadership .
Politically , Greece is a democracy that never grew up ; economically , it remains a poor relation trying to pass in the salons of Europe .
Its 20th - century history is a patchwork of coups and conflicts .
The civil war that followed Greece 's occupation by the Axis powers in the second world war put politics on ice for 30 years .
Greece is the only European country where collaborators were rewarded and those who resisted were punished .
After the left 's defeat by Britain and the US , tens of thousands of resistance sympathisers spent years in prison camps or blacklisted from work .
The military dictatorship of 1967 - 1974 - brought down by the Turkish invasion of Cyprus after a Greek coup - was the last gasp of that repressive era .
Under the conservative statesman Constantine Karamanlis ( uncle of the present prime minister ) democracy was restored , but institutions remained weak ; under the socialist prime minister Andreas Papandreou ( father of the present leader of the opposition ) , liberties were extended but corruption also flourished , hand in a hand with a corrosive leftwing populism .
At the same time , the country has been in the throes of a rapid and painful modernisation .
In 40 years Greece has gone from peasant agriculture supported by a large diaspora to a mixed economy drawing foreign investment ; from the periphery of the developed world to the middle ranks of Europe and the hub of the new Balkans ; from a homogeneous nation where the lucky had jobs for life to a multicultural country where a fifth of the workforce are new immigrants .
Many of its most talented sons and daughters have chosen to work abroad rather than deal with Greece 's disorganisation and bureaucracy .
The social fabric has worn paper - thin .
Few politicians have risen to these challenges ; most have relied on the old system of trading votes for favours , or on periodic appeals to nationalism and xenophobia .
Costas Karamanlis ' New Democracy government - which enjoys a parliamentary majority of one - has surpassed its predecessors in graft and corruption while imposing punitive economic austerity measures .
Greece entered the eurozone in 2001 with a large budget deficit ; prices have risen consistently since then .
In 2004 the country spent an estimated € 10bn on the Olympic games , an unknown portion of it pocketed by contractors and politicians .
The two trade union federations that staged a general strike this week want increased social spending in light of the global recession .
But the government has called for bigger pension contributions and removed a tax exemption for some of the poorest self - employed .
It has also partially privatised ports and plans to do the same with hospitals and schools - at a time when one in five live in poverty and youth unemployment stands near 25 % , the highest in Europe .
Meanwhile , the centre of Athens is full of expensive boutiques ; shopping malls sprout like mushrooms in the suburbs .
Instead of education , values and understanding , the young are being sold an aspirational " lifestyle " they can't afford , which many of them do n't want .
They watch their parents struggling to make ends meet and are told to work hard at school only to find that without connections they can't get a job - or a flat , or decent medical care .
Despite the rhetoric of meritocracy Greece still runs on " means " , up to the highest levels .
In the weeks before the shooting of Alexis , the papers were full of the latest government scandal , a series of lucrative land swaps carried out for Mount Athos 's largest monastery , which involved at least three senior aides to the prime minister and are said to have cost the public more than € 100m .
Graft , of course , goes hand in hand with incompetence .
The government 's failure to contain devastating fires of 2007 , in which at least 67 people died and 642,000 acres of farmland and forest were destroyed , was partly due to political tinkering with the fire brigades ; the lack of progress in restoring burnt - out areas is due partly to pressure from developers eager to cash in .
Given that precedent , no one in Athens is surprised that the riots have got so wildly out of hand .
It is the other shoe dropping - or , as one journalist put it , Nero fiddling for a second time while the city goes up in flames .
Is this a country on the verge of a nervous breakdown ?
For some time , discontent in Greece has been aggressively policed .
The area of Athens where the child was shot - a neighbourhood of ungentrified cafes where young people and anarchists , dope - heads and intellectuals all hang out together - has long been the target of a clean - up operation .
Police violence is not new , it is just that previous victims have been immigrants or Roma and so do not make the media .
As usual when there is social dislocation , the far right has gained strength : the populist Orthodox Rally won 10 seats in parliament for the first time last year , and the neo - fascist Golden Dawn organisation is known to have supporters inside the police .
Now that the lid has blown off the pressure cooker , repression may take more blatant and more violent forms .
More crucially , there is no obvious way out of the impasse .
The problems facing Greece are profound and the recession will pull tensions tighter .
Greece has a long tradition of protest and resistance - some of those occupying Athens University claim descent from the students who fell before the junta 's tanks in 1973 - but less experience of concerted action to find solutions .
After the violence dies down there will , sooner or later , have to be an election .
But the problems the young have exposed have been decades in the making .
No one has begun to imagine a solution .

The byline on the article above mistakenly placed the writer Maria Margaronis in Athens .
She was writing from London .
This has been corrected .
A B.C. man found himself in a deadly fight with a black bear , and had to kill the large animal to escape with his life .
The attack left him with deep gashes in his head that required more than 60 stitches .
Jim West , 45 , was walking with his two dogs near 70 Mile House -- about halfway between Kamloops and Williams Lake -- when his dogs reacted to a noise in the woods .
" All of a sudden I heard a ' whoof ' on my right and I looked over and there was a bear six feet away from me , " he said .
West knew right away he was in serious danger .
" Just one look at that bear and I knew she meant business , " he said .
" The bear rose at the same time as my foot went up .
I 'm not sure if it was her teeth or her claws that caught me in my upper lip . "
That 's when West was knocked down .
He rolled onto his stomach and clasped his hands around his neck to protect his throat .
" She then tore a chunk out my scalp , bit me in my left arm and ribs , " West said .
The Caribou man credits his dogs for drawing the bear away , giving him a chance to defend himself .
When he turned to stand up , the bear -- apparently a mother -- swatted him in the right arm and bit him again .
Knowing he would likely die unless he put up a fight , the bleeding West summoned the strength to get on his feet and picked up a stick about as thick as his arm .
" The bear was running at me full tilt , " he said .
" I swung the stick and hit her right between the ears and it stopped her dead in her tracks .
West says the initial hit stunned the bear , but he realized the animal would attack again if he did n't keep up the fight .
" I knew if I went down a third time I would n't get up again , " said West .
" I pretended I was driving spikes with a sledgehammer , and I did n't stop until that bear went down and I saw blood coming out her nose . "
After West crushed the bear 's skull , he dropped the stick and wrapped his shirt around his head to stop the profuse bleeding .
He then walked to a nearby lodge , where he was taken to hospital for dozens of stitches .
Matter of survival
Conservation officers found the bear three hours later , and confirmed the bear 's injuries .
West says fighting back was a matter of survival .
" Most people would be so scared that they would just stay on the ground and let the bear chew on them , but I have a bit of a temper that I try to stay on top of , " he said .
But also
West blames himself for the attack , saying the bear was just following its instincts when it attacked .
" With my experience in the woods , I know bears are out foraging in the fall , but with the wind in the face , I know he could n't smell me or hear me , " he said .
" I know that people should be prepared when they go out . "
Cindy McCain , with her husband and Sarah Palin at a rally in Pennsylvania , took one of her most personal shots yet at Barack Obama today .
“ The day that Sen .
Obama cast a vote to not to fund my son when he was serving sent a cold chill through my body let me tell you , ” Cindy McCain said in introducing the GOP ticket .
“ I would suggest Sen . Obama change shoes with me for just one day .
I suggest he take a day and go watch our men and women deploying . ”
The McCains have both largely avoided discussing the military service of their two sons during the campaign .
Jimmy McCain , the younger of the two , is a Marine who has already served a tour in Iraq .
His brother , Jack , is at Annapolis .
Cindy McCain is plainly unhappy with Obama .
Her comments this afternoon come a day after she said in Nashville that the Democrat had waged " the dirtiest campaign in American history "

In A New World Where Writers Are Presidents , Politics Functions Through Fiction : New Short Story by Focus on the Family
The election last night was a HISTORICAL FIRST : a man who made his fame initially through writing good books is now the President of the United States .
But is the right - wing going to take this lying down ?
No !
They are human beings , too , with the same murderous pride , the same love of justice and values -- and the same urge to create .
In the rules of formal dueling , the aggressor invariably chooses the weapons of engagement .
President - elect Obama has chosen literature .
His opponent -- Focus on the Family -- shall do no less .
Conservative science fiction -- on the march !
Focus on the Family , suddenly forced into the position of dissenter , has responded like all dissenters : they have turned to fiction .
They have written a short story for the delight of a new America .
" Letter From 2012 in Obama 's America , " apparently written by committee ( or at least credited to committee ) , is narrated by " A Christian from 2012 , " upset at the sweeping changes that the Obama presidency sweeps into power over the course of its first four years .
Among these :- The Supreme Court has voted --- The Boy Scouts of America have disbanded , - Doctors are forced to provide artificial insemination for lesbian couples -- or they could face -
The military is , in a twisted form of affirmative action !-
A 2011 decision
The airwaves are littered with filth !
Nothing can anymore be banned , nothing controlled !-
Terrorists have swarmed from the mountains of Iran , completely overwhelming Iraq !
Their bombs have gone off in two major American cities !
Which two ?
have- Wicked Russia has retaken all of the former Soviet satellite countries ---
Now that the poor can get free health care , the rich must wait two years for their cancer treatments !-
The rich -- are no longer rich !
Since taxes on them have increased so much , everyone who earned more than $ 200,000 / year has closed their business -- All heavy industry has collapsed !
Atlas has shrugged !
The breadlines swell !-
Conservative talk radio no longer exists , since the Obama - backed FCC now requires equal time representation on the airwaves for all viewpoints !
Conservative radio listeners , so they stop supporting conservative talk radio altogether !-
Homosexual activist groups , in a coordinated terrorist denial of service attack , have stopped large bookstore chains and Amazon.com from carrying Christian books !
We at the Fiction Circus applaud Focus on the Family 's decision to finally court the vast fiction - loving electorate , to seek out those crucial , tremulous single - issue fiction voters even in the rat holes and tenements where they survive .
And just as we at the Fiction Circus appreciated all of the feedback we received on our brief attempt to seize power during the early days of the American financial crisis , Focus on the Family will surely appreciate the writerly advice that we offer them on this , their freshman effort at fiction writing .
This is the biggest flaw in this entire story .
The power of fiction is the power to show someone what it would actually be like to live in the world you have created .
As it stands , Focus on the Family 's effort is just a catalog of terrible events .
Think how much more exciting it would be if we really * saw * those events unfold -- Is n't that a better way to show people how realistic and convincing your scenario for America 's future is ?
Is n't that a good scene ?
If you would like to use this scene in any of your future fiction , please send $ 5 to : The Fiction CircusBasement Hole # 17Long Island City , NY 11106A good fiction writer is faithful to two things : his own visions , and his responsibility to conjure those visions in the mind of his audience .
This means not only sensory details , but emotional and intellectual context .
If you have n't done the work of teaching the reader to see through your eyes , your perspective will not be convincing or interesting .
Your fiction will fail .
This passage , for example , presents problems .
Now , you and I are adults , Focus on the Family .
know that of course it's a complete travesty that men who have broken the law are , in the year 2012 , sitting in jail since the secret documents in which they have confessed their crimes are now public .
We know that crime must remain secret and the guilty unpunished .
But your crazy liberal readers may not know that it's a bad thing for people in power who have broken the law to be in jail !
To solve this problem , you might have written a scene like the following :
The price for this one is $ 10 because it has a sex scene in it .
Who is this Christian from 2012 ?
I want to know more about him -- or her !
When did this Christian first know he or she was a Christian ?
When did he or she lose his or her virginity , or did they ?
What is his or her socioeconomic status ?
Age ?
Favorite color ?
Could they at least be eating something while writing the letter , and maybe the letter gets stained with food and tears , and they 're mad about it because now that the economy has collapsed since all of the wealthy people have stopped creating jobs , food is scarce ?
( That way you can show the character 's favorite food , as well as include some sensory details . )
Maybe at the end of the story they say they 're going to eat the letter for fiber ?
Maybe the story ends with Russian Al - Qaeda shock troops breaking in with Obama 's head on a pike , saying I REPENT through his damned , necrotically - animated lips , and he quickly writes GOD BLESS AMERICA before they run him through ?
Would n't that be rad ?
$ 15 .
I could go on , but I think you should just put this piece away for a while , Focus on the Family , then come back to it in a few months and see what you think you could improve about it .
Sometimes you have to take some time away from your writing to really see it for what it is .
In conclusion , Focus on the Family : Thank you for your submission to the Fiction Circus .
We regret that it does not meet our publication needs at this time .
We wish you luck on finding a publisher for this story , as well as with your writing career .
Sincerely , The Editors
Relative to body weight , humans have the heftiest brains in the animal kingdom .
This explains everything .
Scientists asked 72 men , ranging in age from 23 to 80 , to tap their index fingers as fast as they could for 10 seconds .
The researchers also did brain scans to measure in each subject the amount of myelin — a fatty sheath of insulation that coats nerve axons and allows for signaling bursts in our brains .
Both the tapping speed and the amount of myelin was found to decline " with an accelerating trajectory " after age 39 .
Study leader George Bartzokis , professor of psychiatry at UCLA , called the results " pretty striking " and said : " That may well be why , besides achy joints and arthritis , even the fittest athletes retire and all older people move slower than they did when they were younger . "
The myelination of brain circuits was known to peak in middle age .
Bartzokis and others have long argued that brain aging might be primarily related to the myelin breakdown .
Learning more about this decline in fine - motor - skills speed offers some hope for treating the aging brain .
" Since in healthy individuals brain myelin breakdown begins to occur in middle age , there is a decades - long period during which therapeutic interventions could alter the course of brain aging and possibly delay age - driven degenerative brain disorders such as Alzheimer 's , " Bartzokis said .
The findings are detailed in the online version of the journal Neurobiology of Aging .
Time to go back in time for a lesson .
While we do n't think about these things much in our fancy managed languages today , they are built on the same foundation , so let 's look at how memory is managed in C .
Before I dive in , a quick explanation of what the term " pointer " means .
A pointer is simply a variable that " points " to a location in memory .
It does n't contain the actual value at this area of memory , it contains the memory address to it .
Think of a block of memory as a mailbox .
The pointer would be the address to that mailbox .
In C , an array is simply a pointer with an offset , the offset specifies how far in memory to look .
This provides O ( 1 ) access time .
MyArray [ 5 ] ^ ^ Pointer Offset
All other data structures either build upon this , or do not use adjacent memory for storage , resulting in poor random access look up time ( Though there are other benefits to not using sequential memory ) .
For example , let 's say we have an array with 6 numbers ( 6,4,2,3,1,5 ) in it , in memory it would look like this :
===================================== | 6 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 5 | =====================================
In an array , we know that each element is next to each other in memory .
A C array ( Called MyArray here ) is simply a pointer to the first element :
===================================== | 6 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 5 | =====================================
^ MyArray
If we wanted to look up MyArray [ 4 ] , internally it would be accessed like this :
0 1 2 3 4 ===================================== | 6 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 5 | =====================================
^ MyArray + 4 ---------------/
( Pointer + Offset )
Because we can directly access any element in the array by adding the offset to the pointer , we can look up any element in the same amount of time , regardless of the size of the array .
This means that getting MyArray [ 1000 ] would take the same amount of time as getting MyArray [ 5 ] .
An alternative data structure is a linked list .
This is a linear list of pointers , each pointing to the next node
======== ========
======== ======== ======== | Data | | Data | | Data | | Data | | Data | | | -> | | -> | | -> | | -> | | | P1 | | P2 | | P3 | | P4 | | P5 | ======== ======== ======== ======== ======== P( X ) stands for Pointer to next node .
Note that I made each " node " into its own block .
This is because they are not guaranteed to be ( and most likely wo n't be ) adjacent in memory .
If I want to access P3 , I can't directly access it , because I do n't know where it is in memory .
All I know is where the root ( P1 ) is , so instead I have to start at P1 , and follow each pointer to the desired node .
This is a O ( N ) look up time ( The look up cost increases as each element is added ) .
It is much more expensive to get to P1000 compared to getting to P4 .
Higher level data structures , such as hashtables , stacks and queues , all may use an array ( or multiple arrays ) internally , while Linked Lists and Binary Trees usually use nodes and pointers .
You might wonder why anyone would use a data structure that requires linear traversal to look up a value instead of just using an array , but they have their uses .
Take our array again .
This time , I want to find the array element that holds the value ' 5 ' .
===================================== | 6 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 5 | =====================================
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ FOUND !
In this situation , I do n't know what offset to add to the pointer to find it , so I have to start at 0 , and work my way up until I find it .
This means I have to perform 6 checks .
Because of this , searching for a value in an array is considered O ( N ) .
The cost of searching increases as the array gets larger .
Remember up above where I said that sometimes using a non sequential data structure can have advantages ?
Searching for data is one of these advantages and one of the best examples is the Binary Tree .
A Binary Tree is a data structure similar to a linked list , however instead of linking to a single node , each node can link to two children nodes .
========== | Root | ========== / \ ========= ========= | Child | | Child | ========= ========= / \ ========= ========= | Child | | Child | ========= =========
Assume that each connector is really a Pointer
When data is inserted into a binary tree , it uses several rules to decide where to place the new node .
The basic concept is that if the new value is greater than the parents , it inserts it to the left , if it is lower , it inserts it to the right .
This means that the values in a binary tree could look like this :
========== | 100 | ========== / \ ========= ========= | 200 | | 50 | =========
========= / \ ========= ========= | 75 | | 25 | =========
=========
When searching a binary tree for the value of 75 , we only need to visit 3 nodes ( O ( log N ) ) because of this structure :
Is 75 less than 100 ?
Look at Right Node
Is 75 greater than 50 ?
Look at Left Node
There is the 75 !
Even though there are 5 nodes in our tree , we did not need to look at the remaining two , because we knew that they ( and their children ) could not possibly contain the value we were looking for .
This gives us a search time that at worst case means we have to visit every node , but in the best case we only have to visit a small portion of the nodes .
That is where arrays get beat , they provide a linear O ( N ) search time , despite O ( 1 ) access time .
This is an incredibly high level overview on data structures in memory , skipping over a lot of details , but hopefully it illustrates an array 's strength and weakness compared to other data structures .
What happens when a species is categorized under “ least concern ” , meaning there is no threat of being threatened ?
The answer is simple and you ’ll likely get the idea by the time you finish reading .
The Faeroes are a group of islands in Northern Europe , between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean , an autonomous province of Denmark since 1948 .
Every year , young boys trying to prove themselves as adults gather on the beaches for the Annual Dolphin Massacre .
Apparently , the only way to let the world know about their “ hairy chests ” is by turning into merciless killers , luring the Risso ’s Dolphin to the shores and …. you can see what happens .
A playful animal that only feels curiosity towards human kind , the Risso ’s Dolphin is the slaughtered victim from a bad movie that is being played each year in the Faeroes Islands .
Why would you kill an animal that wants to play ?
Why ?
Can they sleep after seeing the sea of blood and so many slaughtered souls ?
Do they build up statistics and ranks to see who ’s the best killer ?
Do they race for the first position ?
Are parents happy with their “ kids ” ?
Who ’s to blame ?
I know that GreenPacks readers are smart and they can come up with their own answers .
For me , it ’s pretty obvious that the human kind is not as advanced as many think , if these kind of actions happen these days .
Denmark !
Shame on you !
Faeroes !
Shame on you !
Though I ’m not a fan of petitions , here ’s one that I ’m supporting .
If you think you can take it ( be warned – high cruelty ) , there ’s an image gallery after the break .
Digg founder Kevin Rose says this is the best time to launch a company , even if the economy is going to hell , venture capital for web startups is drying up , and consumer spending has stalled .
" I believe it 's going to be a great time to start something new , " said Rose , while speaking at the Web 2.0 Summit , in San Francisco .
His argument :
There is less competition and noise in the marketplace and it's easier to get press .
" Funding for consumer internet companies is going away and that means there 's going to be a lot of opporunity for everyone . "
And if you choose to take the plunge , he has a few tips , which mainly boil down to one theme :
Be cheap .
" When Digg launched , I had a day job .
It was something I worked on at nights and during weekends , " says Rose .
And instead of dishing out tens of thousands of dollars for a fulltime developer , Rose outsourced it to a guy through Elance , and paid one - third of what he would have spent on somebody in the U.S .
" [ Outsourcing ] only works up to a certain point . . .
When it comes time to add multiple servers you absolutely need to have talent that 's been there before , " says Rose .
And when it comes to PR , do it yourself .
Aggressively communicate , he says , and Tweet your heart out .
" I really believe that email communication is dead , " said Rose .
" Twitter is more of a real - time communication . "

Hamas celebrated its 21st anniversary with a mass rally last weekend The Islamist militant group Hamas says it has ended its six - month ceasefire with Israel in the Gaza Strip .
As the ceasefire expired at 0400 GMT , Hamas issued a statement blaming Israel which had not " respected " the truce .
Israel 's foreign ministry spokesman said the militants , who control Gaza , " had chosen violence over truth " .
The Egyptian - brokered deal began on 19 June but has been tested regularly by Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel and Israeli operations in Gaza .
Hours after the announcement , Palestinian television carried pictures of militants conducting exercises .
The Israeli military reported a minor shooting incident in the fields of a kibbutz farm near the Gaza border and two rockets exploding in southern Israel , but there were no reports of casualties .
Israel 's Haaretz newspaper reported that the Israeli military had cancelled weekend leave for all troops stationed near the Gaza Strip and instructed units to prepare for mobilisation .
Humanitarian aid Hamas blamed Israel for the end of the ceasefire on Friday , saying it had not respected its terms , including the lifting of the blockade under which little more than humanitarian aid has been allowed into Gaza .

Israel says the blockade - in place since Hamas took control of Gaza in June 2007 - is needed to isolate Hamas and stop it and other militants from firing rockets across the border at Israeli towns .
The UN 's relief agency says the situation has created a " profound human dignity crisis " .
Announcing the end of the truce on its website , Hamas said : " The ceasefire is over and there wo n't be a renewal because the Zionist enemy has not respected its conditions . "
Tough talk as truce ends Voices : Gaza ceasefire ends Guide : Gaza under blockade Papers fear end of Gaza truce Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Hamas had chosen " violence over truth and rocket - shooting over ceasefire " .
He said it showed that Hamas " does not have the best interest of Palestinians in mind " .
" We have said publicly on many occasions that we think the continuation of the ceasefire is in the best interests both of Israelis and of Palestinians , " he said .
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , the head of Fatah which controls parts of the West Bank , is in Washington to discuss the situation with US President George W Bush .
The Palestinian leader will go to Moscow on Saturday , where he will meet President Dmitry Medvedev for the first time .
Russia is a member of the Middle East diplomatic " Quartet " , which also includes the European Union , the UN and the US .
The US state department issued a statement following the Hamas announcement , saying that the ceasefire should be " respected and extended " .
" Violence will not advance , but retard , the hope for peace between Israelis and Palestinians , which currently is being pursued by the legitimate Palestinian government of President Abbas , " the statement said .
The BBC's Arab affairs analyst Magdi Abdelhadi says the end of the ceasefire comes at a critical moment for the Israelis and the Palestinians .
The Israelis are in the middle of an election campaign , and political turmoil on the Palestinian side is set to worsen amid intensified rivalry between Hamas and Fatah .
Hamas , which controls Gaza , is religiously conservative and more hardline in its view of the conflict with Israel , feeling peace talks have achieved little .
Fatah is a secular party which favours dialogue with Israel , but was voted out of government in 2006 in favour of Hamas .
Our correspondent says the failure to extend the truce is hardly surprising , given the fact that the deal has largely failed to achieve what each side originally wanted from it .
Israel thought that it could lead to the release of Cpl Gilad Shalit , captured by militant groups over two years ago .
Hamas hoped it would give it breathing space to consolidate its grip on the Gaza Strip and end the joint Israeli - Egyptian blockade .
The Egyptians hoped it could help to end the deepening rift between Hamas and Fatah .
However , analysts say that many Palestinians feel the fight between the two factions has become less about ideology , but more about power , control and , ultimately , revenge .

Affected pensioners will receive a letter outlining any changes to payments
An estimated 95,000 public sector pensioners have been overpaid £ 126 m since 1978 , the Cabinet Office says .
About 5 % of civil servants , teachers , NHS workers , judicial and armed forces personnel have been overpaid by an average of about £ 1,300 each in total .
The money will not have to be repaid but many face pension cuts .
The Scottish government says it will not cut the pensions of former council , fire and police staff in Scotland , even if they were overpaid .
SNP work and pensions spokesman John Mason said they wanted to avoid pension cuts but the UK Treasury had refused consent to amend pension regulations for 6,000 retired teachers and NHS staff in Scotland .
' Bureaucratic bungle '
They , and retired armed services , judicial staff and civil servants in Scotland will see their pensions cut .
Mr Mason said the Treasury " must reconsider " adding : " It 's time for common sense to prevail .
No pensioner should have to suffer for this bureaucratic bungle . "
Letters are being sent to pensioners across the UK explaining what has happened .
This government has been in power for a lot of years .
They have to get a better grip
David Cameron
Conservative leader
Q&A : Pensions blunder Pension errors ' go back decades '
But the Royal British Legion said the letters were " non specific " so people did not yet know what their new pension payments would be .
Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury , Philip Hammond , said : " It is completely unacceptable for the government just to tell pensioners they have been affected but refuse to give them the full facts until January .
" 95,000 people will now face a Christmas of uncertainty and fear , wondering what is going to happen to their pensions . "
The overpayments began in 1978 and were caused by an " incorrect indexation " of pensions .
In a written statement to MPs , Cabinet Office minister Liam Byrne promised a National Audit Office investigation but said there was " no single cause " .
A spokesman for the Cabinet Office would not calculate how much people would lose , as it would vary widely between individuals and pension schemes .
But the Scottish government said it believed the average annual overpayment to Scottish pensioners in the NHS scheme had been £ 161 , while for those in the teachers ' scheme it was £ 384 .
Banking bailout Mr Byrne said some pensioners would have their payments reduced while others would get below - inflation increases .
Asked about the situation at his monthly press conference , Conservative leader David Cameron said : " You have to ask why this was allowed to go on for such a long time .
" This government has been in power for a lot of years .
They have to get a better grip . "
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable , who first raised the issue in the Commons , said the figures highlighted " decades of incompetence " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Why should retired public sector workers pay for yet more government mistakes ?
Pensions should not be cut FV , UK " The government must not claw back any money from the workers affected , " he said .
" Pensioners should not have to pay the price for government error . "
He said if people faced " big reductions " to pensions they should be staggered .
Xafinity Paymaster , the firm named in the Commons on Monday as having made overpayments , said in a statement it was " not at fault " .
In a statement , it said : " A number of public sector pension scheme administrators , including Xafinity Paymaster , were not notified of the correct GMP data , " the company said .
" The result is that some public sector pensions have been overpaid . "
It said it was " working very closely " with its public sector clients to help identify problems and " correct future pension payments as quickly as possible " .
Mervyn Kohler , of Help the Aged , said he was pleased pensioners were not being asked to pay " for a mistake that was n't theirs " and urged pensioners to check if they are entitled to benefits .
But Chris Simpkins , of the Royal British Legion , told the BBC he had seen one of the letters that had gone out and added : " There is not a hint of an apology or a recognition that people are going to be troubled by this .
I find that quite unbelievable . "
He said many people on low fixed incomes and facing high food and fuel costs would be very worried about getting a below - inflation increase and " in some cases therefore are going to see quite a significant reduction in their weekly income " .
The £ 126 m estimate does not include the separate NHS and teachers ' schemes in Scotland and Northern Ireland and the separate civil service scheme in Northern Ireland .

SATISFACTION GUARANTEED + WORLDWIDE SHIPPING
Enlarge By Stephen Boitano , AP The Supreme Court will not review a case focused on the citizenship status of President - elect Barack Obama .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Supreme Court has turned down another challenge to Barack Obama 's eligibility to serve as president because of his citizenship .
The appeal by Cort Wrotnowski of Greenwich , Conn. , was denied Monday without comment .
Wrotnowski argued that Obama was a British subject at birth and therefore cannot meet the requirement for becoming president .
POLITICS BLOG : More on cases focused on Obama 's citizenship LEGAL EAGLES : Familiar faces at Supreme Court
He wanted the high court to halt presidential electors from meeting to formally elect Obama as president .
Echoing an appeal that was rejected by justices last week , Wrotnowski said that since Obama had dual nationality at birth — his mother was American , his Kenyan father was a British subject — he cannot possibly be a " natural born citizen . "
At least two other appeals over Obama 's citizenship remain at the court .
Philip J. Berg of Lafayette Hill , Pa. , argues that Obama was born in Kenya , not Hawaii as Obama says and Hawaii officials have confirmed .
Federal courts in Pennsylvania have dismissed Berg 's lawsuit .
Federal courts in Ohio and Washington state have rejected similar lawsuits .
Allegations raised on the Internet say the birth certificate , showing that Obama was born in Hawaii on Aug. 4 , 1961 , is a fake .
But Hawaii Health Department Director Dr. Chiyome Fukino and the state 's registrar of vital statistics , Alvin Onaka , say they checked health department records and have determined there 's no doubt Obama was born in Hawaii .
The nonpartisan website Factcheck.org examined the original document and said it does have a raised seal and the usual evidence of a genuine document .
In addition , Factcheck.org reproduced an announcement of Obama 's birth , including his parents ' address in Honolulu , that was published in the Honolulu Advertiser on Aug. 13 , 1961 .

It always cheers us up when some wag gets right in there down at Wikipedia and sabotages the world 's leading provider of balanced , objective and unfiddled info .
It 's thanks very much then to Mick McCarthy who 's just spotted an nice addition to the encyclopedia 's entry on plumbing :
In case you 've left your specs at home , the offending paragraph reads :
" Also , plumbing is a sexual act involving a man and a female .
the aforementioned male pops his cock inn the birds c*nt , lubricating her ring , tickling and widening the said orifice .
when that there hole is at maximum size , pop the scrotum , both knackers , in that bottomless pit of love .
Plumbing is mint . "
The top of the article quite rightly notes that it " may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia 's quality standards " .
Quite right , because that should be " in the bird 's c*nt " .
Come on people , raise your game here - what kind of example is that to set to kids who might be using this invaluable online resource to research a school project ? ®
On election night , I was less anxious about whether Barack Obama would become president than about whether a certain little girl could marry her princess .
I ’m talking about the girl in the “ Yes on 8 " commercial who came home from school after reading “ King and King ” and announced , “ And I can marry a princess ! ”
Not in California , she can’t -- at least for the time being .
Proposition 8 passed 52.5 % to 47.5 % , after a $ 74 - million battle .
I say “ for the time being ” because nobody expects this to be the end of the story .
Already , gay - rights lawyers have filed a challenge in the state Supreme Court , saying the measure is an illegal constitutional revision .
The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles did the same , as did the first couple wed in Los Angeles .
It remains to be sorted out whether gays and lesbians married since June 17 will have their marriages annulled , or converted to some other status , or what .
Advertisement
Domestic partnerships will remain an option for same - sex couples in California .
Other states , mainly along the coasts , will continue to recognize same - sex relationships : some with domestic partnerships , others with civil unions , and a few with outright marriage .
Eventually , this hodgepodge will prove legally unwieldy , or socially inconvenient , or morally embarrassing -- probably all of the above -- and California will revisit the marriage question .
If trends continue -- gay - marriage opponents drew 61 % of the vote in 2000 but only 52 % on Tuesday -- marriage equality will someday prevail .
In the meantime , expect things to get messy .
A same - sex couple married in Massachusetts ( for example ) will have absolutely no legal standing when traveling in California .
A lesbian couple with a domestic partnership in Oregon may have to get married if they move to Connecticut .
New Yorkers wed in California before the passage of Proposition 8 may have their marriage recognized by their home state but not by the state that married them .
And so on .
Both supporters and opponents will argue about whether the courts are the appropriate venue for resolving these issues .
Traditionally , a key role for the courts has been to protect minority interests against the whims of the majority .
One of the especially painful ironies of the Proposition 8 vote is the fact that historically oppressed minorities -- including blacks , Mormons and Catholics -- were among the measure ’s strongest supporters .
Advertisement
It ’s worth remembering , however , that the courts follow social trends more often than they set them .
When the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws against interracial marriage in Loving vs. Virginia , the majority of states had already repealed such laws .
( Incidentally , California was the first . )
As disappointing as the legal setbacks are , they pale in importance next to the cultural shift undeniably underway .
One thing is clear :
That shift is on the side of gay and lesbian equality .
More and more gay and lesbian couples are openly committing to each other , having weddings , and even calling it marriage .
The word is important .
Princesses do n’t dream about someday “ domestically partnering with ” the person they love .
They dream about marrying him -- or , in a minority of cases , her .
To that minority , a bare majority of California voters sent a discriminatory message :
You are not good enough for marriage .
Your relationships -- no matter how loving , how committed , how exemplary -- are not “ real ” marriage .
But “ real ” marriage transcends state recognition of it .
And that ’s another reason why this debate will continue .
Because it ’s not just about what California should or should not legally recognize .
It ’s also about what sort of relationships are morally valuable , and why .
And that ’s a debate that , slowly but surely , gay - rights advocates are winning .
Advertisement
The path to inclusion is not always direct and the pace of change almost never steady .
This setback is by no means a final verdict .
In the coming years , gay and lesbian citizens will continue to tell our stories .
We will demonstrate that , like everyone else , we are worthy of having someone to have and to hold , for better or for worse .
More Americans will realize that such relationships are a good thing -- not just for us but for the community at large .
When the smoke from this battle clears , Americans will realize that gays are not interested in confusing children or in forcing princesses on little girls who do n’t want them .
But they also will realize that , when girls grow up to love princesses , they deserve to live happily ever after too .
There has been much talk lately of America 's Smoot - Hawley Tariff Act , which set off the protectionist dominoes in 1930 .
It is usually invoked by free traders to make the wrong point .
The relevant message of Smoot - Hawley is that America was then the big exporter , playing the China role .
By resorting to tariffs , it set off retaliation , and was the biggest victim of its own folly .
Dealing with one 's parents ' troglodyte political views can be an exasperating business .
But this campaign , perhaps because of its endlessness or because of its increasingly high stakes — the economy melting down or the prospect of Sarah Palin a heart beat away from the presidency — may have made many families more than ordinarily testy about the race .
" I get enough spam as it is , without having to weed through additional emails from family members to determine whether or not they are worth my time .
The jokes and cute kittens emails are OK , but please discontinue the forwarding of political and religious emails , " my brother wrote my mother earlier this year , precipitating several rounds of back - and - forth recrimination in our family .
To me , Sarah Silverman 's comical notion of convincing Jewish relatives in Florida to vote for Barack Obama through familial threats and intimidation , hints at a darker problem : what if yours wo n't come around ?
What if you find yourself having to decide : my politics or my family ?
And having to conclude that these people who I 've mostly cherished are cretins ?
My mom , for instance , likes Palin much more than she likes me .
Palin turns out , in fact , to be my mom 's soulmate .
She 's dreamy over her : " She 's fresh like a daisy . "
She 's an articulation of my mom's dreams and ambitions : " I see her as a role model for my daughters . "
My mother is a Republican - committee - woman type who recently moved from Buckhead in Atlanta to a gated community called Big Canoe an hour from the city in the north Georgia mountains .
If she had political opinions beyond some traditional Republican bromides as well as the irksome articles and emails she forwards , I 'd long ago become inured to them .
To me it was just mom-ish background noise .
Whatever my mother 's politics , we comported ourselves like any more or less liberal ( certainly for the south we were liberal ) , upwardly mobile family — an emphasis on culture betterment , Ivy League schools and , ultimately , an apartment for me in the East Village in Manhattan .
I never suspected this might not be what my mother wanted for her daughter .
But Palin seems now to suggest on her part some sort of reverse snobbery — an attack on the way I was raised by the woman who raised me .
Maybe that was the point : her over identification with Palin is a way to punish her children for not taking her politics seriously ( or for not even listening ) .
Which , indeed , was suddenly another sore point : my mother is truly taken with Palin 's horrifying family .
" If I had gotten pregnant at 17 , " I demanded , " would you have made me get married ? "
" We do n't know that Sarah Palin made her daughter get married .
Though I am glad if she did . "
" Huh ? Hello ?
You were a member of Planned Parenthood ! "
Be calm .
I tried the patient daughter approach ( or the impatient daughter trying to act patiently ) : " OK Mother , but on the issue of Palin 's intelligence and experience ... . "
" Sweetheart , I would like you to get past taste , " said my mom in what seemed suddenly to me like the eerily placid voice of a cult member , " and judge people for what they stand for and how they feel about things .
Reject Palin for her views , but not who she is . "
We broke down shortly .
" Mother , the decision you have to make is between Sarah Palin and me — you can't have it both ways .
You can't love her and love me .
We negate each other .
The point of my life is not to be Sarah Palin . "
Fury .
Apoplexy .
Embarrassment .
Still , my family .
" Is your mother a complete moron ? "
Asked my New York boyfriend as a I tried to describe my frustrating and confounding conversations .
Family pride briefly won out over political sense , rousing me suddenly to attack the boyfriend and defend my moronic mother .
A few weeks after Palin 's nomination , I was forwarded an article about why New York - sort of people necessarily oppose Palin ( which I forwarded to my mother — why not ? ) .
This condescending view spurred another effort on my part of trying to see this as an issue of the elites in places like New York versus my salt - of - the - earth parents in their gated community .
Families exist , after all , in complicated contexts .
If my life had become different from my parent 's life , that did not mean that we had to turn on each other , that we could not somehow understand each other .
Right ?
Nuts .
That 's the thing with Palin .
There just is n't any real way to rationalise her — or to think well of the people who might , or even to quite comprehend the people who might .
The fact of her sudden existence is crazy .
If the rise of George Bush toyed with good sense , Palin stomps it .
She 's beyond logic .
She may be as bizarre and loopy a political development as any in our time .
It 's all the more bizarre for the fact that vast numbers of people get the joke — it 's there in primetime .
Palin is the national joke .
She can't be taken seriously — and she is n't .
She defines the purest , most stubborn , most brazen , knuckledheadness in America .
And even more infuriatingly , it 's an empowering knuckledheadness ( which is exactly the problem with knuckleheadedness ) .
" I believe , " said my mom in one of our recent conversations , growing testier by the moment , her in the flush of her Sarah excitement , " I should be president " .
" You ?
Mother , you ? "
" I have as good a brain as any up there , " said my mom .
" Our nation was not founded by professional politicians . "
Calm down , breathe regularly .
There was , possibly , some good news here .
My mother seemed to be disregarding the relative awe with which she has always held Republicans in Congress .
Palin might be a kind of acknowledgement of how badly the Bush years had turned out .
Palin is , after all , a kind of rejection of politicians — that 's what her having , practically speaking , no experience in government was about .
Anyone can do it better than it has been done .
You can't expect diehard Republicans to admit their own failure and obsolescence .
So a Palin figure is just the agent of this understanding .
She 's hyperbole .
Insisting on this ridiculous figure could be my mom's way of helping the Bush years end .
Maybe .
But then there is another sort of conclusion .
Our own politics emerge from our families during stubborn , implacable , contrary conversations .
In a family debate there is no hope for a fitting riposte , no standard of logical argument , no need of a factual basis .
Just an absolute determination to insist , to not give in , to fight to the bitter end .
Win or lose .
The craziness here is deep .
That 's what explains Sarah Palin : my mom must be angry with me .

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for a new Bretton Woods system , saying that the financial crisis should be used to make world leaders agree to fresh rules and regulations under a long planned new global financial order .
“ Sometimes it takes a crisis for people to agree that what is obvious and should have been done years ago , can no longer be postponed , ” Brown told an audience earlier today .
Speaking at Thomson Reuters ’ editorial headquarters , Brown called for “ a new financial architecture for the global age ” , stating that the Bretton Woods system devised after the second world war was out of touch with the new world order .
Brown said : “ This crisis demonstrates beyond doubt that a global capital market requires much stronger global cooperation and supervision .
And we need to ensure that we have an effective global early warning system to alert us across continents to economic and financial risk . ”
Brown contended that the current financial system is “ too clouded with opacity , conflicts of interest , irresponsible risk - taking , and when problems occur countries have tended to look inwards and deal with them in isolation when it is clear they should look outwards and join in international co-operation . ”
“ We are proposing a world leaders ’ meeting in which we must agree the principles and policies for restructuring the financial system across the globe , ” Brown added .
His speech came after the UK government announced it would bail out three high street banks – RBS , HBOS and Lloyds TSB – to the tune of £ 37bn .
Since that announcement , shares in the banks have plunged on the stock market .
Brown ’s call echoes that of elite figures such as CFR member Jeffrey Garten and Timothy Geithner , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , who have both recently called for a “ new global monetary authority ” , a de- facto global financial dictatorship , operating across borders and forcing nations and corporations to register and adhere to strict monitoring and regulations .
The call is also similar to plans recently touted for a new centralized system of financial supervision across the EU providing greater regulatory powers .

We wrote about Grassfire.org a few times back in 2007 during the height of the immigration debate and then , once the issue died down , stopped paying attention to them because , with their core issues no longer on the table , they seemed to lose focus and stagnated .
But then I came across this Buzzflash piece that informed us that not only is Grassfire back in business , they have re-formed themselves as the home of the “ patriotic , resilient , conservative resistance ” to Barack Obama :
Grassfire.org has launched this “ Join The Resistance ” campaign to give grassroots conservatives a place to join together around the common goal of holding off as much of the Obama agenda as possible .
Our goal is to bring together 1 million Resisters by Inauguration Day .
That would give us one - tenth of the 10 million Obama loyalists who were recruited during the campaign , but we believe 1 million equipped Resisters can make a difference .
The key will be providing web - based structures that truly equip conservatives to Resist .
We begin here – by building this email network to give us the ability to respond immediately to each and every effort by the Obama administration to undermine our liberties .
We plan to add to this platform social networking that will connect Resisters to others in their communities .
We are also exploring ways to put the tools of the Resistance into your hands through mobile phone - based apps that allow you to Resist on the go .
We will use fax , email , phone , and personal visit campaigns to press our case with leaders in Washington , D.C. , who need to know that millions oppose Obama ’s rush to the Left …
Resisting is just the first step .
That is why we propose a three - phased recovery for conservatives : Resist , Rebuild , and Restore .
We believe that resisting will create newfound unity among conservatives .
Out of this , we must then Rebuild our structures .
New , invigorating models must be developed that inform , equip and bring together conservatives and prepare us to return our ideas to political prominence .
The Internet will be a key battleground The Left has moved far ahead in its embrace of and usage of new 2.0 technologies .
The Rebuild process will leave Americans with a clear ideological and practical choice between the Left ’s statist model and our model based on God - given individual liberties .
Having rebuilt , we can then Restore conservative ideas to leadership by winning elections .
Ultimately , a movement ’s ideas must result in electoral victories because that is the basis for legitimate authority and ultimately for implementing one ’s ideas .
Grassfire.org will soon be announcing a breakthrough effort that will allow our members to get engaged directly in the election process .
Stay tuned .
Resist .
Rebuild .
Restore .
It ’s not an easy path for grassroots conservatives , but it is a clear path .
We know what we must do .
And it begins with resisting rightly — respecting the new President but never backing away from the God - given ideals of freedom and liberty upon which this nation was founded .
AT the turn of the 20th century , toward the end of a brutal and surprisingly difficult victory in the Second Boer War , the people of Britain began to contemplate the possibility that theirs was a nation in decline .
They worried that London ’s big financial sector was draining resources from the industrial economy and wondered whether Britain ’s schools were inadequate .
In 1905 , a new book  a fictional history , set in the year 2005  appeared under the title , “ The Decline and Fall of the British Empire . ”
The crisis of confidence led to a sharp political reaction .
In the 1906 election , the Liberals ousted the Conservatives in a landslide and ushered in an era of reform .
But it did not stave off a slide from economic or political prominence .
Within four decades , a much larger country , across an ocean to the west , would clearly supplant Britain as the world ’s dominant power .
The United States of today and Britain of 1905 are certainly more different than they are similar .
Yet the financial shocks of the past several weeks  coming on top of an already weak economy and an unpopular war  have created their own crisis of national confidence .
On Friday , as the stock market finished one of its worst weeks by falling yet again , to roughly half of its level just one year ago , the Gallup Poll reported that Americans were substantially more pessimistic about the economy than they have been in more than two decades of polling .
Nearly 60 percent say the economy is in poor shape , and 90 percent say it ’s still getting worse .

Environmentalists concerned over potential effects on whales .
The US Supreme Court has ruled that national security trumps environmental law , at least in the case of whales and sonar .
Following the decision , the Navy no longer has to stop sonar training exercises off the southern California coast if whales , dolphins and other marine mammals are spotted nearby .
In a 5 - 4 ruling released on 12 November , the court rejected environmentalists ' arguments that the restrictions were necessary to protect the animals .
The environmental concerns are " plainly outweighed by the Navy 's need to conduct realistic training exercises to ensure that it is able to neutralize the threat posed by enemy submarines , " Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority opinion in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) .
Whether , and how , sonar affects whales is hotly contested .
Punchstock
In the name of security ?
During oral arguments held on 8 October , Roberts had voiced concerns about national security , including " the potential that a North Korean diesel electric submarine will get within range of Pearl Harbor undetected . "
The ruling overturns restrictions that require the Navy to stop using sonar during certain ocean conditions and when marine mammals are spotted within 2,000 kilometres of its vessels .
The restrictions were initially put in place by a federal court , but in January the White House exempted the Navy .
However , the restrictions were upheld in March by an appeals court in San Francisco .
The case then went to the Supreme Court .
Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsberg dissented from the decision , whereas Justices Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens dissented in part and consented in part .
Circumstantial evidence suggests that high - intensity mid-frequency active sonar may harm marine mammals , though the link is hotly contested .
In 2005 , for instance , at least 37 whales died after they beached themselves on the coast of North Carolina ; at the time , Navy vessels were offshore on a deep - water training mission involving powerful sonar .
The decision specifically focused on the federal court 's decision of when the Navy could or could not use its sonar , which means this was a very " narrow ruling , " says Joel Reynolds , a senior attorney and director of NRDC's Marine Mammal Protection Project in Los Angeles , California .
He argues that it does not set a precedent for the Navy to be exempt from environmental law in general .
A whale of a fight
Chris Parsons , a marine mammal biologist at George Mason University in Fairfax , Virginia , is not so sure .
He says that the military will probably refer to this case in any future legal challenges involving environmental issues .
Parsons worked with the NRDC to prepare its case , but says that he was n't surprised by the decision after the oral arguments took place last month .
Reynolds says the NRDC will continue to " do everything it can to ensure the Navy does everything it can to reduce risk to marine mammals . "

The Navy has one training exercise remaining in the series of 14 that were under scrutiny .
During the January 2009 drill , it will still have to maintain a sonar - free buffer zone for 12 nautical miles from the California coastline , monitor for marine mammals in the area and avoid key whale habitats .

Home of " The Fourth Stooge " and the Emil Sitka Fan Club
EmilSitka.com is dedicated to commemorating the life and
career of American actor Emil Sitka ( 1914 - 1998 )
Larry , Moe , Curly - Joe and Emil Emil Sitka was an actor in Hollywood for over forty years who played hundreds of roles on stage in theater , on television , and in the movies .
You may not recognize his name but if you 've ever watched The Three Stooges , chances are very good you have seen him perform .
Emil appeared in dozens of Three Stooges comedy shorts , as well as most of their feature films and TV shows , always playing different characters to contrast with and set up the Stooges humor .
Emil is one of very few actors who worked with all four versions of The Three Stooges .
Starting with original Stooges Larry , Moe and Curly in 1946 , Emil appeared frequently during the Shemp years and the Besser period and then continued to show up throughout the De Rita era .
Emil even came very close to joining the team as a Stooge himself in the early 1970's when Moe wanted to carry on with the act .
By this time , Larry 's health ha d forced him to retire so Moe asked Emil to join the group as Larry 's replacement .
Unfortunately , Moe 's own health issues prevented them from ever filming the " fifth set of The Three Stooges " in action ( see below ) .
For decades after the last Three Stooge film images were recorded , Emil contributed to the legacy of the Three Stooges by representing them at numerous events and conventions .
He gave frequent interviews and corresponded with literally thousands of Stooge fans .
He assisted with efforts to put their star on the Hollywood Walk - of - Fame , and he contributed to quite a few notable Stooge books and video retrospectives .
Up until his passing in 1998 , he was fond of entertaining Three Stooges fans from out of town and welcomed them into his home .
Emil Sitka was proud of his work with the comic trio , and he truly appreciated being a " small footnote in the history of the Three Stooges . "
For this long close association with the men , the films , and the legend of The Three Stooges , Emil Sitka has occasionally been called " The Fourth Stooge . "
It has a nice ring to it , so it 's been adopted here as our official slogan :
Emil Sitka - The Fourth Stooge
Please take a moment to look around and learn more about Emil Sitka 's life and Hollywood career .
The Biography tells the unlikely story of an orphaned youth who beat the odds and achieved his dream of becoming a Hollywood movie actor .
Or maybe hit the Stooge highlights for some fun pictures and videos .
Or you can take a leisurely stroll back in time to the Golden Age of Hollywood by reading the stories of each of Emil 's film roles in sequence to see what a working actor actually went through .
You 'll see that , besides being a " fourth stooge , " Emil did a lot of work with other stars as well , and he ended up participating in a wide variety of shorts , feature films and television shows that now makes for an interesting cross-section of Hollywood history .
There are many rarely - seen pictures and posters in the first film section : ( 1946 ) .
Click on a title to see details from Emil 's List of Films , a personal journal in which he logged nearly all of his film work .
And once you 've started you can click <-- or --> to move consecutively from one film role to the next .
Many include a short essay that expands on Emil 's experiences , some of which include his very own , very personal diary entries for the days he worked , providing a unique perspective you wo n't find anywhere else .

Another sex scandal at the International Monetary Fund .
The last thing the world financial crisis needs ...
WSJ : The International Monetary Fund has launched an investigation into whether its chief , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , abused his position in connection with a sexual relationship with a subordinate , in a case that could roil a key global institution at a crucial moment in the world financial crisis ...
" There was an allegation concerning improper behavior of a personal nature on the part of the managing director , " said Masood Ahmed , the IMF 's chief spokesman .
" All allegations , particularly relating to senior management , need to be investigated . "
In a statement , Mr. Strauss - Kahn said : " I have cooperated and am continuing to cooperate with outside counsel to the Fund concerning this matter . "
He said the " incident which occurred in my private life " took place in January 2008 .
" At no time did I abuse my position as the Fund 's managing director . "

I was in Detroit last week …
I have family there .
I also drive a car .
And I would rather that the world does n’t melt and the economy thrive .
So I ’m uniquely qualified to weigh in on the automobile industry .
Not only should Congress encourage / facilitate the organized bankruptcy of the Big Three , but it should also make it easy for them to be replaced by 500 new car companies .
Or perhaps a thousand .
That ’s how many car companies there were 90 years ago .
That ’s right , when all the innovation hit the car industry , there were thousands of car companies , with hundreds running at any one time .
From Wikipedia :
Throughout this era , development of automotive technology was rapid ,
due in part to a huge number ( hundreds ) of small manufacturers all
competing to gain the world ’s attention .
Key developments included
electric ignition ( by Robert Bosch , 1903 ) , independent suspension , and four - wheel brakes ( by the Arrol - Johnston Company of Scotland in 1909 ) . [ 16 ]
Leaf springs were widely used for suspension , though many other systems were still in use , with angle steel taking over from armored wood as the frame material of choice .
Transmissions
and throttle controls were widely adopted , allowing a variety of
cruising speeds , though vehicles generally still had discrete speed
settings rather than the infinitely variable system familiar in cars of
later eras .
Between 1907 and 1912 , the high - wheel motor buggy ( resembling the
horse buggy of before 1900 ) was in its heyday , with over seventy - five
makers including Holsman ( Chicago ) , IHC ( Chicago ) , and Sears ( which sold via catalog ) ; the high - wheeler would be killed by the Model T .
Back in its heyday , Ford Motor made every single part of its cars , including raising the sheep that grew the wool that made the fabric that upholstered the seats .
That ’s not true any more .
Now , suppliers make just about every part .
We need those suppliers , and we need them to stay healthy .
What we do n’t need are giant companies with limited choice , confused priorities , private jets and a bully ’s attitude .
I ’d spend a billion dollars to make the creation of a car company turnkey .
Make it easy to get all the safety and regulatory approvals … as easy to start a car company as it is to start a web company .
Use the bankruptcy to wipe out the hated , legacy marketing portion of the industry : the dealers .
We ’d end up with a rational number of " car stores " in every city that sold lots of brands .
We ’d have super cheap cars and super efficient cars and super weird cars .
There ’d be an orgy of innovation , and from that , a whole new energy and approach would evolve .
Betcha .

Abstract
This paper provides a review of significant academic studies and non-academic research endeavors in the realm of negative emotions ( with an emphasis on worry ) , gender , and decision making .
The author encourages behavioral finance researchers to place greater attention into the development of new research studies and academic papers in the area of negative affect ( feelings , emotions , moods ) .
The financial psychology literature on gender and worry documents the emerging hypothesis that researchers should explore is women reveal greater degrees of worry than their male counterparts for different categories of financial services and investment products .
In a methodical attack Wednesday , gunmen with automatic weapons cornered and killed an American aid worker and his Pakistani driver in the capital of Pakistan ’s volatile northwest region .
The American was identified by police and colleagues as Stephen Vance , who was working under contract to an organization that carries out development projects in Pakistan ’s tribal areas , a stronghold of the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
The tribal areas lie between Peshawar , the regional capital , and the Afghan border .
The killing came less than three months after gunmen tried unsuccessfully to assassinate the senior U.S. diplomat in Peshawar , Lynne Tracy .
She escaped uninjured when gunmen fired on her armored vehicle .
The early - morning attack Wednesday took place in the same part of the city , a prosperous enclave known as University Town where many diplomats , foreign aid workers and expatriates live .

Police and security officials said Vance was on his way to work when attackers blocked his vehicle in a small passageway and sprayed the car with bullets .
Unlike American diplomats , aid workers are generally not required to travel in “ hard , ” or bullet - resistant , vehicles .
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad , Wesley Robertson , confirmed the killing of an American citizen and his driver but did not identify Vance or his organization by name .
Robertson said American diplomats in Peshawar have been told not to move about the city in the wake of the attack .
Police and paramilitary forces cordoned off the area and were searching for the assailants .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility , although suspicion fell on Taliban - linked militants who have made increasing inroads around the city .

Peshawar and its environs have been a focal point of the insurgent - fueled violence sweeping Pakistan .
Hours after the attack that killed Vance , a suicide car bomber struck a Pakistani military camp about 20 miles north of Peshawar , killing at least five soldiers and wounding four .
On Tuesday , three people were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the city ’s sports stadium .
Over the last three months , the United States has been carrying out a campaign of airstrikes in the tribal areas aimed at senior militant figures .
Many Pakistanis believe the Predator drone strikes , which have killed insurgents and civilians , have helped galvanize militant attacks in cities , including the September truck bombing of the five - star Marriott Hotel in Islamabad , Pakistan ’s capital , which killed more than 50 people .
The Pakistani military is also carrying out a major offensive in the Bajaur tribal area , an important corridor to Afghanistan where many Islamic militants are believed to be based .
The army says more than 1,200 insurgents have died in the offensive , which began in August .
But tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting , many of them living in squalid refugee camps .

Very often , though , we do not want our words to be taken too literally .
When we speak in ways that risk offense , for example when we criticize a friend , we may add intentional vagueness or unnecessary circumlocutions .
Say a friend proves to be too confrontational at a dinner party .
To encourage greater civility , we might resort to indirect hints ( “ Say , did you read the latest by the Dalai Lama ? ” ) or metaphor ( “ I guess sometimes you just need to blow off some steam ” ) .
These linguistic acts establish a new channel of communication — off - record communication — signaling that what is being said has an alternate meaning .
Teasing is just such an act of off - record communication : provocative commentary is shrouded in linguistic acts called “ off - record markers ” that suggest the commentary should not be taken literally .
At the same time , teasing is n’t just goofing around .
We tease to test bonds , and also to create them .
To make it clear when we ’re teasing , we use fleeting linguistic acts like alliteration , repetition , rhyming and , above all , exaggeration to signal that we do n’t mean precisely what we ’re saying .
( “ Playing the dozens , ” a kind of ritualized teasing common in the inner city that is considered a precursor to rap , involves just this sort of rhyming : “ Do n’t talk about my mother ’ cause you ’ll make me mad / Do n’t forget how many your mother had . ” )
We also often indicate we are teasing by going off - record with nonverbal gestures : elongated vowels and exaggerated pitch , mock expressions and the iconic wink , well - timed laughs and expressive caricatures .
A whiny friend might be teased with a high - pitched imitation or a daughter might mock her obtuse father by mimicking his low - pitched voice .
Preteens , sharp - tongued jesters that they are , tease their parents with exaggerated facial expressions of anger , disgust or fear , to satirize their guardians ’ outdated moral indignation .
Similarly , deadpan deliveries and asymmetrically raised eyebrows ( Stephen Colbert ) , satirical smiles and edgy laughs ( Jon Stewart ) all signal that we do n’t entirely mean what we say .
THE BENEFITS OF TEASING
The language of teasing is intimately linked to the language of social behavior .
Because teasing allows us to send messages in indirect , masked ways , it is an essential means of navigating our often - fraught social environments .
In teasing , we become actors , taking on playful identities to manage the inevitable conflicts of living in social groups .
Placed into groups , children as young as 2 will soon form a hierarchy — it will be clear even among toddlers who is in charge and who is not .
Hierarchies have many benefits — the smooth division of labor and resources , protecting weaker members of the group — but they can be deadly to negotiate .
Male fig wasps chop their rivals in half with their large mandibles .
Narwhal males loll about with tusk tips embedded in their jaws — vestiges of their status contests .
Coyotes engage in heavily coded bouts of play ; those who do n’t live shorter , ostracized lives .
Given the perils of negotiating rank , many species have evolved dramatized status contests , relying on symbolic displays of physical size and force to peacefully sort out who ’s on top .
Stags roar .
Frogs croak .
Chimps throw branches around .
Hippos open their jaws as wide as possible to impress competitors .
And humans tease .
Teasing can be thought of as a status contest with a twist .
As humans evolved the ability to form complex alliances , the power of a single individual came increasingly to depend on the ability to build strong bonds .
Power became a matter of social intelligence ( the good of the group ) rather than of survival of the fittest ( raw strength ) .
As a status contest , teasing must walk a fine line , designating status while enhancing social connection .

Take nicknames .
One of the most common forms of teasing , they also serve to assign status and enhance or create social bonds .
They commonly emerge in marriages , between friends , among co-workers and between the public and its leaders .
Artful nicknames involve such off - record markers as exaggeration , alliteration and metaphor , which comment upon the individual ’s excesses .
Muhammad Ali was the Louisville Lip ; Richard Nixon , Tricky Dick ; and George W. Bush , Uncurious George .
During my fifth - grade trip to the Mendocino tide pools , I became Dacher Kelp Crab to all , a fitting riff on my name , our coastal locale and my sullen temperament .
Nicknames are relationship - specific placeholders .
They allow us to escape to the world of play , where we mock in affectionate fashion and critique the powerful in safety .
The seasons are shifting .
For most places , colder weather and less daylight means the steady approach of winter .
In my home in Northern California , summer lasts through October .
The sun shines steadily , temperature drops to a tolerable high 60’s and not a drop of rain is seen .
Suddenly , it ’s dark by 5:00 pm and the cuffs of your pants are constantly wet from trudging through the rain puddles , you know that the dreaded winter is here .
In California , we definitely have seasons .
They may not be as apparent as in other parts of the country or world , but they are still here , believe me .
Spring is sunny and foliage is growing , little rain .
Summer is sunny no rain and hot .
Fall is sunny but not so hot , and some leaves change color .
Winter is rainy and cold .
See , seasons .
Since most Californians love the sun , and get quite used to it with about 9 months of uninterrupted vitamin D consumption , winter is an unhappy time for a lot of us , me included .
Go Away Rainy Day : Less sunlight , more darkness , rain and cold can cause people to be suffer from a subset of depression known as Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) , even more people are affected by a more mild version of " winter blues , " causing an overall depressed mood , melancholy and mild symptoms of depression during the winter months .

This phenomenon is not an isolated event .
If the darkness , wetness , and cold get you down during the winter months and you experience increased stress due to the holidays and other pressures , then you are not alone .
SAD , or Seasonal Affective Disorder , may affect over 10 million Americans during winter .
Even more may experience the milder “ winter blues , ” that cause increased depressive mood and anxiety .
SAD is recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a subtype of major depressive episode .
SAD may be experienced by one or many symptoms of depression such as fatigue , increased need for sleep , decreased energy , weight gain , anxiety , difficulty concentrating , loss of interest and desire to be alone , increased craving for sweets , thoughts of death or suicide .
Symptoms begin in fall , reach their peak in winter and resolve in the spring .
Although the exact cause of SAD remains unknown .
Researchers speculate that SAD is connected to the amount of sun and light which if changed , can alter our biological clock and natural rhythms .
Exposure to sunlight regulates mood , sleep and hormones and due to decreased sunlight in winter , biological clock may be delayed and run more slowly .
Symptoms of SAD increase with rise in latitude .
Thus , there are more people in Maine who experience SAD than those who live in Florida .
Other theories postulate that changes in sunlight can alter levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and may be affected in individuals with SAD .
People who suffer from severe SAD , whose symptoms interfere with daily life , can optfor treatment such as mood stabilizers , SSRI ’s used to treat depression , or psychotherapy .
Studies have also shown that exposure to special lamps known as light therapy can be an effective treatment for SAD either alone or in combination with other treatments .
Light therapy , is treatment with specialized lamps that mimic the natural spectrum of sunlight .
Daily treatment with specialized lamps , most effective in the mornings , can reset circadian rhythms and offset symptoms caused by SAD .
Schools , such as the University of Wisconsin , offer SAD lamps for use by students and faculty .
Light Up Your Life : Research studies have seen that SAD lamps are an effective treatment for those who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) .

For those of us who may not suffer from severe SAD , but who do experience a moderate amount of “ winter blues , ” there are a number of tricks that you can do to keep your mind happy even when the weather gets you down .
The trick lies in a handy family chemical in your brain : endorphins .
These are the chemicals responsible for the rush likened to opiod use , or runner ’s high , and is cause for feelings of general euphoria that can last up to hours after initial release .
Get Happy : Endorphins , released during times of physical or mental stress , give feelings of euphoria , and can be triggered a number of ways .

Endorphins , more specifically , are a group of neurotransmitters in the brain that activate opiate receptors in the brain .
Scientists hypothesize that endorphins are released when the body encounters stress .
Thus when your body is stressed physically by vigorous exercise , endorphins are released , and whoosh , you are suddenly euphoric and pain free .
Endorphins activation of opiate receptors produces an analgesic response , alleviating severe pain .
Emotional stress can also cause a release of endorphins which act on the limbic system to reduce melancholy and anxiety .
That is the key .
Endorphins are the body ’s own defense for a depressive mood , and if you can help trigger an endorphin rush , you can chase away the winter blues .
Here are some ways to keep up your endorphins and keep you blissful all winter long .
Stretch It Out : Exercising in winter can be tricky , but with some indoor tools , like a yoga mat and some weights , you can keep your endorphins flowing and stay fit this winter .

I know what you ’re thinking , “ Erin you must be crazy to suggest that jogging in the rain is going to make me feel better about this whole winter situation ! ”
That may be true .
Outdoor exercises may not be the most optimal for a winter workout , which is why you should invest in some special indoor equipment for exercise indoors .
For those of us who belong to a gym , use it .
Cardio not only gets your blood pumping , but
triggers an endorphin rush , which can last for hours after your workout is done .
Other indoor activities could help during winter months as well .
Investing in a Yoga mat and a yoga / Pilates DVD or a pair of hand weights and resistance bands can get you a great workout for little cost .
It ’s true .
Engaging in intercourse not only increases your heart rate , but an orgasm triggers a flood of endorphins .
Having sex in winter is just as easy as any other season , so light a fire in the fireplace , uncork that bottle of wine and endorphins away .
3 ) Eating Food :
Spicy : Peppers , due to their pain - causing spiciness , cause can endorphin release locally on the tongue as well as centrally in the brain .
This is to relieve the body from the pain caused by eating the pepper .
No pain , no gain .
Photo credit : Flickr user jslander .
Certain foods , such as chili peppers and chocolate are known to release endorphins .
Peppers trigger endorphins to shield the body from the pain caused on the tongue from the chemicals in the food .
Cocoa has an addictive quality and when ingested , causes a release of endorphins .
Therefore , chocolate is just good , and makes you feel good in return .
4 ) Experience some emotions :
Certain emotions can cause a release of endorphins if they cause a certain amount of stress on the body .
Significant laughter , fear or emotional experience can trigger endorphins .
So , that means order up some Netflix or rent some movies .
It could be a comedy , horror , thriller or drama .
As long as you get involved in the content , endorphins ahead .
Other triggers can be caused by viewing a piece of inspirational artwork or listening to your favorite music .
Try visiting an interesting museum or enjoying a concert this winter .
5 ) Get some Sun :
Good Day Sunshine : Even though winter may have little to no visible sun , light can have just as much of an effect on cloudy days , so try to spend even a few minutes outside to help manage winter blues .
Photo credit : Flickr user Mannequin-
Although the lack of sun may be the root of our problems , that does n’t mean you have to live without it .
Take advantage of the sun that does occur in the winter , and enjoy a few moments outdoors and take advantage of letting more light into your home .
Researchers say that sunlight can trigger endorphins possibly as a protection against sunburn .
Other ways to avoid SAD :
If you suffer from Winter Blues , then there are also other ways to keep yourself from feeling the strain of winter .
Along with maximizing your exposure to sunlight during the winter by opening up windows and spending time outdoors on sunny days , you can give yourself other opportunities to chase away winter blues .
Color can change or affect one ’s mood .
Bright colors are known to lift spirits and give a happier mood .
Colors like grey , black and other dark colors will depress mood , while colors like orange , yellow and red will give an impression of warmth and light , which can positively affect mood .
So put on that red sweater or consider some seasonal décor for your home .
Adding a little color to your life this winter may help your mood .
Anxiety , stress and depression during the winter may be caused by lack of sunlight , but anxiety from work or other life related problems may also be piled on during the winter months .
Identify which issues in your life are causing stress and give yourself easy steps to resolve them .
For those that may experience lack of interest or other such symptoms of depression , try giving yourself a long - term project to do and sticking with it .
Motivation to finish the project or involve yourself in a constructive outlet may take your mind off the lack of sun and focus on your project .
Although millions may suffer from Winter Blues , with a little light , endorphins and some advice from your doctor , you do n’t have to be quite as SAD this winter .

The Canadian military has identified three soldiers based at CFB Gagetown who were killed Saturday when their armoured vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device in southern Afghanistan .
Cpl. Thomas James Hamilton , Pte. John Michael Roy Curwin and Pte. Justin Peter Jones , based at CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick , were killed around 9 a.m. local time as they were responding to reports people were planting a suspicious object west of Kandahar city , Brig . - Gen. Denis Thompson told reporters in Kandahar Airfield .
Another soldier was injured and was transported to the hospital at the base , where he is in fair condition .
The injured soldier 's name was not released .
The three were members of Golf Company , 2nd Battalion , Royal Canadian Regiment , said Thompson , the commander of Task Force Kandahar .
Hamilton was on his third tour in Afghanistan , while Jones was originally from Newfoundland , Thompson said .
Two of the men were parents —
Curwin the father of three children , Hamilton the father of a daughter , Annabella .
" I would like to extend my personal condolences to the families and friends for these men and I look to all Canadians during this Christmas season to hold their memories dear , " Thompson said .
" We share this moment of grief together today and think of these young men who were so full of life and full of promise . "
Canada has now lost 103 soldiers and one diplomat since the military mission began six years ago .
The blast occurred in an area that until this summer was largely free of insurgent activity , the CBC's David Common reported Saturday from Kandahar .
" It ’s an area that Canadian soldiers know very well , having been in that area repeatedly certainly over the past few days but , of course , over the past few months , " he said .
The Canadian military has been using new technology in recent months — including spy drones and X - rays of entire roads — in its attempt to prevent IED attacks , as well as acting on more tipoffs from Afghan citizens who see something out of the ordinary , Common said .
The recent attacks against Canadian troops in Kandahar province have come during the harsh Afghan winter , when Taliban fighters traditionally have gone back to Pakistan to regroup .
" There continues to be a presence , certainly of the IED bomb - making factories — they have not let up , " Common said .
Soldier tried to ' make this world a better place '
Cpl. Mark Robert McLaren , based in Petawawa , Ont. , was killed in Afghanistan on Dec. 5 along with two other Canadian soldiers .
( ( DND ) )
News of the latest deaths came as about 1,000 people gathered Saturday in a Peterborough , Ont. , armoury for a military funeral for Cpl. Mark McLaren , one of three Canadian soldiers killed last week in Afghanistan on the same stretch of road .
McLaren , a member of the 1st Battalion , Royal Canadian Regiment , based at CFB Petawawa in eastern Ontario , died on Dec. 5 alongside Pte. Demetrios Diplaros and Warrant Officer Robert Wilson when their vehicle struck an improvised explosive device .
His brother , Miles McLaren , said his death should serve as inspiration to those continuing to serve in the Afghan mission .
" I hope some Canadian boys — especially the ones overseas — they do him proud , " McLaren said outside the armoury .
" Because somebody has to make this world a better place , and [ now ] my brother 's not here to do it .
… This is Canada , and he did it for us , and he did it for the whole world . "
Diplaros , 25 , was buried Friday in Toronto , while the funeral for Wilson , 38 , will take place Monday at CFB Petawawa .
After a disappointing cookie recipe last week , I decided to hunt down a recipe that sounded like a winner .
I found this recipe on allrecipes.com and tweaked it a bit based on my own preferences and the reviews of those who have made them .
I changed the name of these bars to better reflect their goodness .
These bars are rich , fudgey and full of Oreo goodness !
Trust me when I say to cut these bars small as a little goes a long way !
Despite being so rich and fudgey , they are not overly sweet in my opinion .
Do n’t get me wrong , they are definately sweet and will satisfy a craving in no time but not so much so that your teeth hurt just eating one .
If you are not a chocolate lover ( I know there are a few of you weirdos out there ) do not make these as you will be highly disappointed !
However , if you need an easy recipe that is rich and fudgey these are for you .
These bars will be perfect for the holidays and I can’t wait t make them with the Winter Red Oreos or the Peppermint Oreos .
I may substitue the Andes Peppermint baking chips on top instead of using the mini chocolate chips to enhance the Peppermint flavor for the holidays .
The only downside is they will not ship well and should really be kept chilled until a few hours before serving .
When serving for dessert I recommend cutting into squares and drizzling melted white chocolate over the bars , as I have done in the picture below .
What a pretty presentation for such a simple recipe .
MMMM good .
I rate this recipe a 9
Oreo Fudge Bars
adapted from allrecipes.com
1 16oz . package of Oreo cookies
1 stick butter , melted
1/4 tsp satl
1 ( 14 ounce ) can sweetened condensed milk ( I used Fat Free )
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup semi- sweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips ( could use another 1 /2 cup semi- sweet chips if you like )
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips
Preheat the oven to 325 .
Line a 9×13 pan with foil and lightly spray with PAM .
Set aside 6 Oreo cookies for the toppings .
In a small food processor grind the rest of the cookies .
If you do n’t have a food processor , just pound with a rolling pin until the cookies are fine crumbs .
Add the salt to the crumbs and stir to combine .
Melt butter and gently stir together with the cookie crumb mixutre .
Press firmly into the bottom of the prepared pan .
Coarsely chop the remaining cookies into chunks and set aside .
Over a double boiler or in the microwave , melt 3/ 4 cup semi-sweet and 1 /2 cup milk chocoalte chips together with the condensed milk and vanilla .
Stir frequently until smooth .
Spread evenly over the prepared cookie crust .
Sprinkle the mini chocolate chips and the Oreo cookies chunks over the top of the filling .
Press down gently into the chocolate topping .
Bake for 20 - 22 minutes oven .
Allow to cool on counter for 1 hour .
Chill in fridge until completely cold and set before cutting into bars or it will make a big mess .
* These are not too great hot from the oven but are great after chilling and the filling has set !

Advertisement A man who fathered nine children by raping his two daughters over many years has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 19 - and - a half years .
The 56 - year - old from Sheffield was sentenced to a life term for each of the 25 rapes he had admitted .
The attacks led to 19 pregnancies , Sheffield Crown Court heard .
The daughters said in a statement : " His detention in prison brings us only the knowledge that he cannot physically touch us again . "
The defendant refused to leave his prison cell to attend the sentencing .
Nine of the children were born , two of whom died on the day of their birth .
The other 10 pregnancies were miscarried or aborted .
The daughters ' statement through South Yorkshire Police added : " The suffering he caused will continue for many years and we must now concentrate our thoughts on finding the strength to rebuild our lives . "
Review launched
The father moved the family from village to village in rural locations to keep them isolated and to avoid detection .
Sheffield Crown Court was told that he " took pleasure " in knowing the harm he was doing to his daughters .
Judge Alan Goldsack QC said : " Questions will inevitably be asked about what professionals , social and medical workers , have been doing for the last 20 years . "
When either one of his victims tried to end the sexual abuse , he threatened to kill them and their children
Nicholas Campbell QC
Jayne Ludlam , director of children 's and young people 's services at Sheffield City Council , said the abuse was revealed to social workers in June .
Ms Ludlam said : " This is one of the most harrowing cases we have had to deal with and to say we are shocked to find this level of abuse being perpetrated by this person is an understatement .
" Due to the seriousness of this case an independent review has already been launched which will look into the circumstances surrounding the case and the contact the agencies had with the victims . "
James Baird , representing the defendant , said : " It must be inconceivable to those who have listened to this case that these offences have been carried out , in this day and age in a so - called civilised society , over such a long time and with such consequences , without them being reported or investigated . "
The court heard that the sexual abuse started when the two sisters were prepubescent but that they only realised the other was being abused when they became pregnant some years later .
The court heard that on a number of occasions doctors advised the women to stop having children by the same father .
Family ' frightened ' Nicholas Campbell QC said : " The defendant played Russian roulette as to whether there would be complications in the pregnancies and with the health of his daughters . "
The defendant threatened his daughters with a " real hiding " if they refused to have sex with him .
Mr Campbell said : " All the defendant 's children spoke of his domination over their family life .
He was tall and strongly built . "
" All the family were frightened of him .
When they heard his car pulling up outside the house , the children and their mother ran to their respective rooms .
" His younger daughter told of the frightening habit her father had of putting her head next to the flames of their gas fire and that when she struggled to get away on certain occasions she burnt her eyes . "
Childline plea
On one occasion , the women called Childline and asked for a guarantee that they could keep their children , but when one was not offered they ended the call .
Mr Campbell said : " When either one of his victims tried to end the sexual abuse , he threatened to kill them and their children , and when they threatened to tell police , he said they would not be believed .
" All the time , when the sisters were challenged about the paternity of their children , they would cover it up .
" They started taking the pill .
He said they should not be taking it and , just as they felt unable to avoid his sexual abuse , they obeyed .
" They spoke of his pleasure at fathering their children whilst at the same time they had fears for the welfare of these children and how they would cope . "
Lib Dem leader and Sheffield Hallam MP , Nick Clegg , said : " All our thoughts are now with the victims of this most abhorrent crime , who must be given the time and privacy to rebuild their lives . "
His fellow Sheffield Brightside MP and former Home Secretary David Blunkett said it was difficult to determine who , outside of the family , could have been expected to take steps to intervene .
He said : " Those who at least made an effort to do something should not be the ones who are pinpointed - it is those who did not who should examine their conscience . "

Planets circle the stars that dot the heavens .
Before 1995 , we could n't have said that with any certainty .
Now we know of more than 300 planets orbiting distant stars , and we have a fleet of telescopes looking for them .
The ultimate goal is to find another Earth orbiting a star like the Sun , but the quest on the way to that Holy Grail has yielded some strange benchmarks .
Meet the planet COROT - exo - 3 b .
It orbits a star slightly larger , hotter , and brighter than the Sun .
The star is not an unusual one in any way , but the planet is definitely weird : it orbits the star in just over 4 days , which is pretty close in , though not a record breaker in and of itself .
What 's bizarre is that it has about the same diameter of Jupiter , but has 21.6 times Jupiter 's mass .
That makes it denser than lead .
If I could stand on the surface of this planet , I 'd weigh
COROT - exo - 3b compared to Jupiter
4200 kilograms ^*.
That 's
over 9000 pounds !
Oof .
This is by far the most massive planet found so close to its parent star .
There is another extrasolar planet found with about that mass , but it orbits its star much farther out .
The ones we 've found that orbit their stars so close tend to have masses much smaller than this .
For comparison , Jupiter takes 12 years to circle the Sun once .
Mercury takes 88 days .
So we 're talking big planets , really close to their stars .
This planet is challenging to models .
How did it form ?
It most likely formed farther out from the star -- gravitational influences make it hard for a large planet to form close to a star -- and then gradually moved in .
This can happen due to friction , of all things : when the star and planet are young , there is a disk of material leftover from the planetary formation .
As the planet sweeps through this material it slows its orbit .
It spirals in due to draggravitational interaction with the disk , and eventually settles down when the disk material thins out a few million kilometers from the surface of the star itself .
The mass of this newly discovered planet is pretty freaky .
Normally , anything with a mass more than about 15 or so times the mass of Jupiter would be considered a brown dwarf , a " failed star " , as some people call them ( I do n't ) .
But at the lower end of the brown dwarf mass range , it gets a bit hard to tell the difference between a planet and a BD .
Some people say planets and BDs form in different way ( planets grow in size from smaller bodies building up over time through collisions , while BDs and stars form from the collapse of material in a nebula ) ; but I do n't like this definition .
You could have two objects that look precisely the same , yet one could be a planet and the other a BD , just because they formed in different ways .
That strikes me as silly .
Either way , COROT - exo - 3b is weird .
It was discovered by COROT , an orbiting European Space Agency mission designed to look for stars that dip in brightness as an orbiting planet passes in front of them .
That gives the size of the planet ( the amount the light dims is proportional to the size of the planet ) .
The mass was found using ground - based telescopes , by measuring the amount the planet tugs on the star as it orbits .
That 's how the incredible density of this object was found .
As we search the sky for Earth analogue planets , we 're bound to find things at the limits of our understanding .
This ultra - dense ball of compressed matter certainly falls into that category .
And we 're still new at this !
What else lies out there at the fringe of our knowledge ?
^*For those of you who want to complain about my use of mass as a weight , read this , and acknowledge my superior logical skills .
However , given the amount of sturm and drang this has caused among people , I 've decided to simply strike through the part that has given everyone the vapors .
There are fears if the ransom is paid other super - tankers will be targeted
Somali Islamist insurgents have begun searching for the pirates who hijacked a giant Saudi - owned oil tanker last Saturday , reports say .
A spokesman for the al - Shabab group , Abdelghafar Musa , said hijacking a Muslim - owned ship was a major crime and they would pursue those responsible .
The pirates are thought to be trying to obtain a multi-million dollar ransom .
The ship , the Sirius Star , is believed to be anchored off the Somali port of Haradheere .
It has an international crew of 25 people and is carrying $ 100 m ( £ 67 m ) worth of crude oil .
' Show of force '
" We are really sorry to hear that the Saudi ship has been held in Somalia , " Mr Musa told the Associated Press .
" We will fight them . "
Reports said Islamist fighters had descended on Haradheere in an apparent show of force , saying they were looking for the pirates .
" The Islamists arrived searching for the pirates and the whereabouts of the Saudi ship , " an unnamed elder in the port told Reuters news agency .
" I saw four cars full of Islamists driving in the town from corner to corner .
The Islamists say they will attack the pirates for hijacking a Muslim ship . "
Another report suggested local militia and Shebab fighters had arrived in Harardhere in a move to position themselves for a share of any spoils .
" There are many militiamen who have arrived in the town and they want to get a share from the pirates if the ransom is paid , " Ahmed Abdullahi , a local elder , was quoted by AFP news agency as saying .
Meanwhile , Kenya reported on Friday that Somali pirates had been paid more than $ 150 m ( £ 101 m ) in ransoms in the past 12 months .
Thanks to the Mossad , Israel 's " Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks " , the Hamas was allowed to reinforce its presence in the occupied territories .
Meanwhile , Arafat 's Fatah Movement for National Liberation as well as the Palestinian Left were subjected to the most brutal form of repression and intimidation
Let us not forget that it was Israel , which in fact created Hamas .
According to Zeev Sternell , historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , " Israel thought that it was a smart ploy to push the Islamists against the Palestinian Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) " .
Ahmed Yassin , the spiritual leader of the Islamist movement in Palestine , returning from Cairo in the seventies , established an Islamic charity association .
Prime Minister Golda Meir , saw this as a an opportunity to counterbalance the rise of Arafat ’s Fatah movement .
.
According to the Israeli weekly Koteret Rashit ( October 1987 ) , " The Islamic associations as well as the university had been supported and encouraged by the Israeli military authority " in charge of the ( civilian ) administration of the West Bank and Gaza .
" They [ the Islamic associations and the university ] were authorized to receive money payments from abroad . "
The Islamists set up orphanages and health clinics , as well as a network of schools , workshops which created employment for women as well as system of financial aid to the poor .
And in 1978 , they created an " Islamic University " in Gaza .
" The military authority was convinced that these activities would weaken both the PLO and the leftist organizations in Gaza . "
At the end of 1992 , there were six hundred mosques in Gaza .
Thanks to Israel ’s intelligence agency Mossad ( Israel ’s Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks ) , the Islamists were allowed to reinforce their presence in the occupied territories .
Meanwhile , the members of Fatah ( Movement for the National Liberation of Palestine ) and the Palestinian Left were subjected to the most brutal form of repression .
In 1984 , Ahmed Yassin was arrested and condemned to twelve years in prison , after the discovery of a hidden arms cache .
But one year later , he was set free and resumed his activities .
And when the Intifada ( ‘ uprising ’ ) began , in October 1987 , which took the Islamists by surprise , Sheik Yassin responded by creating the Hamas ( The Islamic Resistance Movement ) : " God is our beginning , the prophet our model , the Koran our constitution " , proclaims article 7 of the charter of the organization .
Ahmed Yassin was in prison when , the Oslo accords ( Declaration of Principles on Interim Self - Government ) were signed in September 1993 .
The Hamas had rejected Oslo outright .
But at that time , 70 % of Palestinians had condemned the attacks on Israeli civilians .
Yassin did everything in his power to undermine the Oslo accords .
Even prior to Prime Minister Rabin ’s death , he had the support of the Israeli government .
The latter was very reluctant to implement the peace agreement .
The Hamas then launched a carefully timed campaign of attacks against civilians , one day before the meeting between Palestinian and Israeli negotiators , regarding the formal recognition of Israel by the National Palestinian Council .
These events were largely instrumental in the formation of a Right wing Israeli government following the May 1996 elections .
Quite unexpectedly , Prime Minister Netanyahu ordered Sheik Ahmed Yassin to be released from prison ( " on humanitarian grounds " ) where he was serving a life sentence .
Meanwhile , Netanyahu , together with President Bill Clinton , was putting pressure on Arafat to control the Hamas .
In fact , Netanyahu knew that he could rely , once more , on the Islamists to sabotage the Oslo accords .
Worse still : after having expelled Yassin to Jordan , Prime Minister Netanyahu allowed him to return to Gaza , where he was welcomed triumphantly as a hero in October 1997 .
Arafat was helpless in the face of these events .
Moreover , because he had supported Saddam Hussein during the1991 Gulf war , ( while the Hamas had cautiously abstained from taking sides ) , the Gulf states decided to cut off their financing of the Palestinian Authority .
Meanwhile , between February and April 1998 , Sheik Ahmad Yassin was able to raise several hundred million dollars , from those same countries .
The the budget of The Hamas was said to be greater than that of the Palestinian Authority .
These new sources of funding enabled the Islamists to effectively pursue their various charitable activities .
It is estimated that one Palestinian out of three is the recipient of financial aid from the Hamas .
And in this regard , Israel has done nothing to curb the inflow of money into the occupied territories .
TV Makes You Stupid

It helps me keep adding to this site when you get yours from these links , too .
Thanks !
June 2008 back to HDTV index I personally buy from Ritz , Adorama and Amazon .
I can't vouch for any other ads .
TV is for idiots .
I realized this when I was 7 years old and have n't owned a TV since .
I have n't watched TV since 1969 .
I worked in it for decades , and knew enough not to watch it .
It makes you stupid , and my colleagues in the networks agree !
Some of them would point out what a verbal beating they'd get from friends who actually saw what got broadcast .
When you work in most aspects of TV , you rarely have time to watch what 's going out .
My wife watches reality shows , saying " look how stupid this is . "
That 's why people watch it ; these shows are deliberately stupid .
I remember when Bravo and A&E broadcast good stuff , but it only appealed to educated people , so today they 're down in the mud wrestling with everyone else .
Movies are OK because they are art , like a painting , a play or a symphony .
You have to pay to watch them .
TV is bad : it caters to sucking as many people as possible in to watch for the purpose of selling ads .
Movies try to make people want to pay to see them , while TV just wants people to tune in just long enough to make a tick in Nielson 's ratings .
TV is going away , since only older people are still watching .
People today watch the Internet instead .
The Internet can make you stupid or smart , depending on what you do there .
I realized that although I found TV programs like Get Smart , The Beverly Hillbillies , Twilight Zone and Star Trek entertaining , none of this was making me any smarter or more interesting .
I worked in TV ever since high school .
Working in TV is very different from watching it .
I used to design weapons of mass destruction , too , but never shot off a boomer myself , even if we simulated it plenty of times to make an honest living .
We know better , and you should too .
You might think that my " TV is for idiots " mantra might not have gone over well working in Hollywood , but others in the biz agreed .
There is no such thing as idle time .
Any time one person is watching TV , another person is reading , studying , exercising , and otherwise getting ahead of the loser in front of the TV .
Any time spent in front of TV is time that 's putting one further and further behind .
TV is designed to attract as many viewers as possible .
Programming is designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator .
Language is kept to a fifth - grade level or below so it does n't lose anyone .
PBS is even worse .
PBS makes you at least as stupid , but it 's worse because the people watching it have a sense of hubris , thinking that they are smarter than people watching other networks .
That makes them watch more , and get even stupider .
Sure , once a week my wife brags that she learned something on TV .
When I read books , even I learn something every minute .
The best TV seems to come from Fox .
Murdoch is a master of media , and knows how to draw a crowd .
This dawned on me in 2001 with Fox ' " Marry a Millionaire , " where a local San Diego comedian , who was n't really a millionaire , had women dancing naked in front of him on stage .
In two hours , he picked the one he wanted to marry .
Women watched the show in astonishment , called their friends to watch " this horrible thing , " and Fox made TV history .
I had to live that down for a few years , because that comedian used my last name for his stage name .
It 's funny how many grown - ups do n't know that TV is pretend .
As attributed to Murdoch , " the purpose of news is to entertain , not to inform . "
My wife watches TV and believes it .
Even the news is pretend ; have you ever seen all the credits for writers at the end ?
( or have those been squeezed - back too far ? )
I 've heard rumor that there might be some people who think I 'm smart , but I 'm barely riding in the front seat of the short bus .
The only way I 'm able to pass is because all the time most people are sitting in front of a TV , I 'm off trying to learn something .
I 'm not smart at all , it 's just that TV has made so many people so much stupider .
TV is only getting worse as it fades away .
The ancient Romans knew how to draw a crowd .
Back in the good old days , a carnival was exactly that : they brought in animals and slaughtered them for the public , free .
Also expect more televised executions , beatings , car chases and people getting killed as caught on security cameras .
We all thought they were kidding on Monty Python when they suggested showing the freeway , but that 's what we get today in America .
I could go on , but please remember that watching TV is about as helpful as smoking pot .
Some people might enjoy it , and it makes money for the people providing the goods , but it lowers your IQ .
If you 've got extra smarts you might survive , but it 's not helping you .

Remember Kim Stolz ?
She was the contestant from America 's Next Top Model Cycle 5 who went on to become a correspondent for MTV News .
Apparently , she took issue with last week 's " Fiercee " photo shoot on ANTM , particularly Annaleigh 's photo , for which the concept was " interviewer with an attitude . "
Remember when Kim interviewed Tyra at the real Fiercee Awards ?
And she was kinda bitchy ?
Well Kim thinks that Tyra was taking a dig at her with Annaleigh 's modeling assignment .
So Kim wrote an open letter to Tyra about it , and then made a parody video of Top Model panel , complete with that weirdo black hood that TyTy wore last week , and the shitty over - dubs !
Take a look after the jump .

Kim Stolz Responds To Tyra Banks ’ Dis ( ? )
On ‘ America ’s Next Top Model ’ [ MTV via FourFour ]
Our old SAN was set up in the traditional way : the SAN backend units did RAID - 5 interally , and this RAID - 5 space was carved up into LUNs and used by the frontend fileservers .
For natural reasons all of our fileservers wound up using LUNs from all of our SAN backends .
This setup has low overhead , decent resilience , and decent performance .
Our new fileservers are set up in an entirely different way , and among other things they use RAID - 1 instead of RAID - 5 .
Although we were driven to adopt a RAID - 1 approach by other issues , it has turned out to be entirely the right choice ( despite the space overhead ) .
The problem with our old environment was what I will call ' IO contamination ' .
In practice , any substantial IO to any LUN on any of the RAID - 5 arrays touches all of the disks in the array , which means that it contends with and affects any other IO happening to any other LUN on the array .
This is especially important because multiple streams of IO are quite likely to force seeks , and the weak point of all current disks is how many separate IO operations a second that they can sustain .
Thus , since all of our fileservers used each backend , significant IO load on one LUN on one array could slow down many filesystems on all fileservers .
( The most glaring place that this showed up was parallelizing backups .
Attempting to balance the IO load was basically impossible , so we had to just hope for the best by telling Amanda to run a few backups per fileserver . )
Did I mention that the different filesystems were owned and used by all sorts of different research groups and professors ?
The great advantage of RAID - 1 for us is that it makes IO traffic for different things genuinely separate ; with only a few exceptions ( such as if we max out a network port 's bandwidth ) , IO to one group 's space does n't affect IO to another group 's space .
In practice , this independence gives everyone significantly better performance ( and it has certainly sped up our backups a lot ) .
And if there ever are performance problems , figuring out the cause is going to be much easier , because it will actually be possible to work backwards from ' hot ' disks to find whatever is creating the load .
The drawback of RAID - 1 is that it does cost more .
Fortunately the cost of disks is dropping all the time , especially if you build your SAN out of commodity hardware .
( Since we are basically doing random IO , RAID - 1 also has a straightforward performance advantage ; it significantly increases how many spindles we have , and the rule for random IO is that the more spindles you have , the better . )

an edited version of this article
.
Congratulations , Senator Obama .
You ran a good campaign , and you racked up an historic victory .
As you get ready for your new responsibilities , let me suggest four ways for you to become a reliable steward of the economy : During the campaign you assembled an impressive team of economic advisers from the nation ’s top universities , including Austan Goolsbee from University of Chicago and David Cutler and Jeff Liebman from Harvard .
Your campaign ’s director of economic policy , Jason Furman , is a smart , sensible , and well - trained policy economist .
I know :
He is a former student of mine .
Pay close attention to what they have to say .
They will often give you advice quite different from what you will hear from congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid .
To make sure you hear the views of your economists , put them in offices close to yours .
Tell your chief of staff to invite them to all the relevant meetings ..
No party has a monopoly on truth .
Be ready to take the best Republican policy proposals and make them your own , as Bill Clinton did with welfare reform in 1996 .
Health policy is a case in point .
Over the past several months , you lambasted McCain ’s proposal to reform the tax code to include a refundable health insurance tax credit .
Did you know that long before McCain ever proposed this idea , it was advanced by Mr. Furman , your campaign ’s policy director ?
He can explain to you why the Furman - McCain plan makes a lot of sense .
Now you may decide that this plan does not go far enough .
You may want a more generously funded social safety net to help the less fortunate get health care .
Fair enough , but in pursuing that goal , you run into the next issue ..
The nation faces a long - term imbalance between government spending and tax revenue .
The fundamental problem is that the federal government has promised the elderly more benefits than the tax system can support .
This fiscal imbalance will become acute as more baby boomers retire and start collecting Social Security and Medicare .
Yet during the campaign , you promised that you would cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans , that you would vastly expand health insurance coverage , and that you would never cut Social Security benefits or raise the retirement age .
You will almost surely have to renege on some of these promises .
As your economic team will often remind you , even if the laws of arithmetic are ignored during campaigns , they provide a real constraint when making actual policy ..
As a new senator , you voted along predictable left - wing lines .
As president , you will need a more eclectic , nuanced approach .
Take trade policy , for example .
In the senate , you voted against the Dominican Republic - Central American Free Trade Agreement .
You opposed free trade agreements with Colombia and South Korea .
You supported Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham in their quest to put tariffs on Chinese goods if China failed to revalue its exchange rate .
You supported the Byrd Amendment , which encouraged domestic companies to file anti-dumping suits against foreign competitors .
You supported subsidies for domestic producers of corn - based ethanol and tariffs on imports of more efficient sugar - based ethanol .
Your economists can explain to you why these positions were wrong - headed .
Economic isolationism is not in the national interest .
A high point of the Clinton presidency was the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement , which passed both the House and Senate with a majority of Republicans and a minority of Democrats .
This past Tuesday , many people voted for you hoping you would achieve the kind of economic success that Bill Clinton enjoyed in the 1990s .
Your best chance of delivering what they want requires that you abandon some of your past positions and pursue a more moderate , bipartisan course .----
A Late Stone
Age family grave , showing the careful arrangement of bodies .

A Stone Age massacre has provided evidence of the earliest known nuclear family .
The evidence also suggests that , just like today , some early humans lived in blended families .
Archaeologists have long suspected that people lived in nuclear families at least as far back as the Stone Age .
The idea even has a foothold in popular culture – remember Fred , Wilma and Pebbles Flintstone ?
But the evidence for Stone Age nuclear families has been flimsy , mainly based on extrapolations from how we live now , and speculations about relationships between adults and children found buried together .
Advertisement
“ We have been inferring the past from the present , but it was n’t necessarily true .
Now , we have tested the hypothesis and found that at least one Stone Age nuclear family existed , ” says Wolfgang Haak who led a team at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz .
The new evidence comes from a detailed analysis of the remains of 13 people , buried in four gravesites in Eulau in Germany , dating to the later Stone Age , 4600 years ago .
Family ties
All the signs are that these people died violent deaths – one female had an arrowhead embedded in her spine , and the head and forearms of several other adults and children had stone - axe marks .
Examination of the skeletons found that the adults were aged between 25 to 60 years old – old for that period – and the children younger than 13 years old .
Several of the adults had partially healed injuries .
“ These were the old and the injured , children and women .
Whatever violence happened that day , they were not capable of fighting , ” says Haak , now at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at Adelaide University .
Analysis of DNA in the bones and teeth of the remains in one grave found that an adult male and female , and two boys , were the classic nuclear family .
“ The two kids have her mitochondrial DNA , and his Y chromosome – that ’s a nuclear family , ” says molecular anthropologist Brian Kemp of Washington State University in Pullman .
Arm in arm
Fossil evidence of our ancestors in the middle Stone Age is rare , and Haak points out that it is still unknown when nuclear families became common .
Prehistorically , people would have died young in childbirth or from disease , potentially making nuclear families unsustainable .
Indeed , in a second grave , the one adult , a woman , was not related to two children , who were a brother and a sister .
The team was not able to extract DNA from the remains of a third child , an infant facing the woman .
“ The fact that they all ended up in the same grave , makes us think that they had some relationship in life , ” says Haas .
The new findings also suggest an explanation for anomalies in how later Stone Age people in central Europe were buried .
Typically , males of all ages rest on their right side , facing south , and women on their left side facing south , but sometimes there are exceptions to this rule .
This was the case with the nuclear family , where each child faced north , towards one of the adults with whom their hands entwined .
Haak speculates the arrangement may symbolise blood ties .

BBC News , Guangdong province , southern China
Outside the An Jia baby cot factory in Dongguan , a group of factory workers surrounds a single policeman on a motorbike .
Once - thriving workshops are now silent and bare " Where are the three people you arrested ? " they shout at him .
" Give them back to us ! "
The officer looks uneasy and he decides to retreat .
Right now , factory workers here are angry .
The world 's financial crisis has begun to hit them .
It is easy to understand why : since the West can't afford to buy as much , China is n't able to sell as much .
In better times , the An Jia factory would ship its baby cots to the US .
But now its workers say the US has stopped buying .
Their wages have been cut by up to 75 % .
One man waves two wage slips , typed on small pieces of paper .
The slip for May shows that he earned 2,523 yuan ( $ 370 ; £ 248 ) that month .
The slip for September shows that his earnings were cut to 445 yuan ( $ 65 ) .
" Our boss wants us to bail him out , " shouts Li San Le , one of the workers .
" When things were good , the boss did n't give us a raise , but now that he's in trouble , he wants us to rescue him , " adds a woman standing in the crowd .
Jobs dry up
At a nearby job market , groups of men stand around looking gloomy .
Mr Lou , a craftsman , needs a new job .
This is the first time he has ever had to go out and find one .
" What kind of pay are you looking for ? " the job market organiser asks him .
Everyone is quite worried .
Not just owners , but workers as well
Sergio Sum
Director , Top Sun Manufacturing
" I know things are tough - but I need a job which pays more than 3,000 yuan . "
" You wo n't get that here , " the organiser replies .
Men like Mr Lou have spent their lives working in a country which never seemed to run out of jobs or money .
But now things have changed .
This year growth has slowed , and more than 60,000 businesses have closed down .
Reports say that more than 50 % of toy factories have closed down .
In the corner of one abandoned furniture factory in Dongguan , there is a pile of half - finished table legs .
The only person at work is a woman quietly collecting bits of wood to sell as scrap .
Outside the factory , the workers ' dormitories are empty .
Cheap posters of Chinese pop stars are still stuck to the wall - many of those who used to work here were teenagers who had come in from the countryside to get a better life .
Going home
Next door , a shoe factory is still going .
Workers pack up boxes of sandals to be shipped to Europe .
Many now unemployed young workers are going back to their villages " Everyone is quite worried .
Not just owners , but workers as well , " says Sergio Sum , the director of Top Sun Manufacturing Co Ltd .
Many workers are now having to go back home to their villages .
Amid the queues of passengers at Guangzhou railway station , one group of young women sits on top of piles of bags and cases .
Each of them has the same frizzy hairstyle .
One sends text messages on her mobile phone , which is decorated with pendants .
These women used to work in a television factory , until the factory started running out of cash .
" We used to work overtime , " says one of the workers , who declines to give her name .
" But then , we were told to work one day and take one or two days off .
Finally , we were n't even getting a basic salary . "
The long lines at this railway station will make China 's government nervous .
The Communist Party has stayed in power partly because it has made poor people richer .
But now the world 's financial crisis has arrived .
So , what happens in this country if hundreds of millions of workers no longer feel they can get a better life ?

Oliver Postgate , who died on Monday 8 December , should be remembered as one of the great children 's storytellers of the 20th century .
Generations were transported by his imagination - and thanks to creations like Bagpuss and Ivor the Engine - were inspired to use their own .
He wrote for newstatesman.com between November 2006 and February of this year .
In the closing months of his life his primary preoccupation seemed to be with man 's wilful destruction of the planet .
His musings on the subject were suitably whimsical .
This year in his God Dialogues he wrote on the inherent worthlessness of money , the deeply damaging effects of religion ( " The separation between law and religious injunction has got to be absolute and stay that way , otherwise fear will come back into the land " ) and nuclear weapons .
Oliver died in Kent aged 83 .
I last heard from him on 1 July .
I 'd asked him to write for us again .
He wrote : " Dear Ben , Been ( am ) very ill .
The world will have to manage without me for a bit .
all the best Oliver " .

Time passage via the natural world
This beautiful , informative calendar has four panels representing the Earth ’s four natural seasons , either from equinox to a solstice or from a solstice to an equinox .
Stepping outside the convention of having 12 pages full of squares , the calendar ’s four panels guide you through the astronomical season using several bands :
Sky , Sun , Moon , Earth , Tide Chart and Gregorian Calendar from top to bottom .
I use the tide band to remind me when it might be a good time to plan a trip to the Oregon Coast .
This year , I ’ve already taken seven trips and have found an excellent low tide every time , so I ’ve been able to see all kinds of cool critters , including chitons , crabs , starfish and large barnacles .
I look at my ECOlogical Calendar every day and at the moon every night .
I ’m still working on learning to identify the planets and stars in the sky , which is a lot of fun , and the calendar serves as a perfect reminder .
The calendar is also very good for giving reminders of a number of phenomena you just would n’t otherwise think about at all , such as the activities of amphibians , butterflies , worms , salmon , bats , eagle mating , fledging of birds ; plus things such as the mushroom season and when bears start to hibernate .
Most of us could probably keep track of some of those seasonal events on our own , but few could keep track of them all — even a professional ecologist or farmer would have to be fairly compulsive to be mindful of everything on this calendar , simply by memory and / or Internet searches .
You could probably use the Calendar Band to note your regular doctor ’s appointments , interviews , and meetings if need be .
But personally , I use a conventional planner for that , primarily because this calendar seems too beautiful to mark with my handwriting .
It ’s as much a work of art as it is a practical tool for nature awareness .
And how many art works change with the seasons ?

November 3 , 2008 : Pegleg Horse
Not always .
Meet Riley , the pegleg horse .
Quote : A crippled horse has been given a false leg in a pioneering operation to stop her being put down after suffering an awful injury .
These amazing pictures show how technology has given the lame horse a new lease of life rather than face the prospect of being put down .
Now this mare Riley will spend the rest of her days in an animal sanctuary .
~snip ~
To endure recovery and get accustomed to an artificial leg , a horse must have a calm temperament because post - op rehabilitation involves spending a good deal of time hoisted in a sling .
If the horse is prone to anxiety , the stress incurred while in the sling could lead to colic .
The horse also needs to have a strong opposing leg - in Rileys case , a strong right rear leg - because she would be bearing much of her weight on that leg until she adjusted to the prosthesis .
~snip ~
Not long after the procedure , she was trotting , running and even playing , as well as easily bearing the weight of Dr Vlahoss daughter , whose birthday wish was for Riley to be well enough to ride .
Then last month Riley returned home to Best Friends .
Though stiff from the long ride , she now wanders her pasture grazing , trotting and flirting .
Jen Reid said :  Shes eating great .
She takes lots of naps .
She likes to flirt over the fence with her male neighbor .
 Shes doing everything a normal horse would . 
link " They shoot horses , do n't they ?
" Not always .
Meet Riley , the pegleg horse .
And Riley lived happily ever after ... although there 's a chef in France that 's very disappointed .

The descent of man ~ Nixon , Friedman , Reagan , Trump .
While the biggest news out of the energy and environmental world this week may have been a competition between the UN conference in Poznan , or perhaps the planned appointments of President - elect Obama ’s environmental team or any other relevant news , the funniest news had a hands - down winner .
That was , most certainly , the strange and sudden appearance of the ‘ Clean Coal Carolers ’ – an industry sponsored Flash animation of pieces of coal , dressed in warm hats and scarves , singing adaptations of traditional Christmas tunes .
Only these songs were remixed to tout the brilliance and necessity of coal in American life .
[ social_buttons ]
On Friday , however , the Clean Coal Carolers ceased to exist .
Thanks to an overwhelming voice of discontent with the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity ’s ( ACCCE ) marketing ploy , the cute little lumps of coal were retired just about as fast as they popped up .
The page once reserved for the carolers ( http://www.americaspower.org/carolers) now redirects to a post on the ACCCE blog , lamenting that it was “ time for them to head home for the holidays . ”
From the Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC to the pages of environmental blogs across the net , the Clean Coal Carolers were ridiculed into nonexistence .
Why the ACCCE would put so much time into creating and promoting the Clean Coal Carolers , which they obviously did , but kick them to the curb so quickly raises a very important question : is the public beginning to see through the coal industry schtick ?
While the ACCCE cites a recent internal poll showing that 70 % of Americans believe coal to be our energy future , the general public sentiment seems to say otherwise .
While promoting their own false reality of ‘ clean coal ’ , the ACCCE conveniently forgets to include carbon dioxide emissions , which make up 82 % of all greenhouse gas emissions , in its statistics .
Even worse , the folks at America ’s Power are unapologetic about their cherry - picking of facts , continuing to propagate their less - than - exact calculations as the final word on coal ’s responsibility for global warming emissions .
Luckily , the recent emergence of the Reality Campaign has been able to counter the $ 35 million PR campaign effectively , stating quite plainly that , “ in reality , there ’s no such thing as clean coal . ”
The sudden death of caroling coal seems to show that the backlash from environmentalists and average citizens , alike , has quite an effect on the industry .
Whether it was getting under the skin of ACCCE Vice President of Communications , Joe Lucas , or effectively communicating to the public the misinformation of the industry public relations machine , this episode has surely shown us that no matter how powerful , the coal industry is still susceptible to the power of the people .

Dick Cheney on Budget & Economy Vice President of the United States ; Former Republican Representative ( WY )
Cheney to Treasury : " Deficits do n't matter "
O'Neill , fired in a shakeup of Bush 's economic team in December 2002 , raised objections to a new round of tax cuts and said the president balked at his more aggressive plan to combat corporate crime after a string of accounting scandals because of opposition from " the corporate crowd , " a key constituency .
O'Neill said he tried to warn Vice President Dick Cheney that growing budget deficits - expected to top $ 500 billion this fiscal year alone - posed a threat to the economy .
Cheney cut him off .
" You know , Paul , Reagan proved deficits do n't matter , " he said , according to excerpts .
Cheney continued : " We won the midterms ( congressional elections ) .
This is our due . "
A month later , Cheney told the Treasury secretary he was fired .
The vice president 's office had no immediate comment , but John Snow , who replaced O'Neill , insisted that deficits " do matter " to the administration .

Increase domestic energy production without damage to land
CHENEY : We are in trouble because the administration has not addressed these issues .
We have the prospects of brownouts in California .
We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the Northeast .
We ’ve got gasoline prices rising .
For years , the administration has talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil , but they have n’t done it .
We ’ve got the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years .
Our imports are at an all - time record high .
That means we ’re more subject to fluctuations in price .
We do n’t have the refinery capacity .
We have n’t built a new refinery in this country for over 10 years .
We have a serious , long - term problem of our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy .
That will always be the case , but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction .
We think we can do it in an environmentally sound manner .

The sex - starved marriage has been the topic of at least two recent books , “ 365 Nights ” and “ Just Do It . ” But Mr. Young ’s call from the pulpit gave the discussion an added charge .
It should not , in his view .
This is not a gimmick or a publicity stunt , Mr. Young says .
Just look at the sensuousness of the Song of Solomon , or Genesis : “ two shall become one flesh , ” or Corinthians : “ do not deprive each other of sexual relations . ”
“ For some reason the church has not talked about it , but we need to , ” he said , speaking by telephone Friday night on his way to South Africa for a mission trip .
There is no shame in marital sex , he added , “ God thought it up , it was his idea . ”
Those who attend Fellowship ’s location here or one of several satellite churches in the Dallas area and one in Miami are used to Mr. Young ’s provocative style .
( The real “ f word ” in the marital boudoir , he says , is “ forgiveness . ” )
But the sex challenge was a bit much for some of his church members , who sat with arms crossed in uncomfortable silence , he recalls , while many in the audience gave him an enthusiastic applause .
One parishioner , Rob Hulsey , 25 , said his Baptist relatives raised their eyebrows about it , but he summed up the reaction of many husbands at Fellowship Church when he first heard about the sex challenge 
“ Yay ! ”
A week later , he and his wife , who are expecting a baby and have two older children , could not stop holding hands during the sermon .
His wife , Madeline Hulsey , 32 , said she was just as thrilled to spend a week focusing on her husband .
Usually , “ we start to kiss , and it ’s knock knock knock , Mom ! ” she said .
Others found that , like smiling when you are not particularly happy , having sex when they did not feel like it improved their mood .
Just eight months into their marriage , Amy and Cody Waddell had not been very amorous since Cody admitted he had had an affair .
LOS ANGELES —
The first box opened at the Los Angeles Auto Show Wednesday contained another box — Nissan 's funky little Cube city car .
The Cube looks looks like a big marshmallow and brings Japan 's love of small cars to America , where the 30 - plus -mpg wonder rolls into showrooms next fall .
As the name implies , the Cube is nothing more than a box on wheels that Nissan design chief Shiro Nakamura called " clever , witty and fun , with a unique blend of fashion and function . "
He forgot to say " adorable , " in a " What the hell is that ? " kind of way .
The car that made its worldwide debut today is the third generation of a car that 's been wildly successful in Japan .
By bringing it to America , Nissan is betting the Cube will be a hit with the same urban hipsters who bought the first - gen Scion XB , another car that looked like the box it came in .
Nissan says the Cube is n't a car , it 's an experience — how else to explain Nakamura 's saying the Cube does n't have an interior , it has " a social space , " or , if you prefer , " a casual lounge . "
Whatever you call it , it 's pretty freakin ' roomy .
There 's room for five people inside that little box , which is just 13 feet long and not quite 5.5 feet wide .
Interior appointments include a CD stereo with XM radio that blares through six speakers powered by a big honkin ' Rockford - Fosgate amp and , of course , a jack for your iPod .
That asymmetrical rear and side window not only looks cool , it increases visibility .
Power comes from a 1.80 - liter four - banger that puts out 122 horsepower through the front wheels .
There 's a six - speed transmission or , if you 're too lazy to shift , a continuously variable automatic transmission that Nissan says allows the Cube to get more than 30 mpg on the highway .
( Exact figures have n't been released yet . )

Latest Developments :
1 ) Conventional crude production - Latest available figures from the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) show that crude oil production including lease condensates decreased by 1.14 million b/d from July to August , resulting in a total production of crude oil including lease condensates of 73.80 million barrels per day .
The all time high production record of crude oil now stands at 74.94 million b/d reached in July 2008 .
2 ) Total liquids production - In October world production of total liquids increased by 1.81 million barrels per day from September according to the latest figures of the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , resulting in total world liquids production of 86.94 million b/d.
Average global production in 2007 was 85.41 million b/d according to the IEA .
In 2008 an average of 86.82 million b/d has been produced from January to October .
The US Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) in their International Petroleum Monthly puts average global 2007 production at 84.40 million b/d and average liquids production from January to August 2008 at 85.73 million b/d .
3 ) OPEC Production - Total crude oil production including lease condensates of the OPEC cartel decreased by 10,000 b/d to a level of 32.15 million b/d , from September to October , according to the latest available estimate of the IEA .
Natural Gas Liquids production increased by 240,000 b/d to a level of 5.37 million b/d from September to October .
Average total liquids production in OPEC countries in 2008 from January to October was 37.33 million b/d , versus 35.96 million b/d in 2007 and 35.71 million b/d in 2006 .
4 ) Non-OPEC Production - Total crude oil production including lease condensates of non-OPEC decreased by 1,0 million b/d from July to August to a level of 40.16 million b/d , according to the latest available estimate of the EIA .
Average crude oil production of Non-OPEC from January to August 2008 was 40.97 million b/d , versus 41.35 million b/d in 2007 and 41.41 million b/d in 2006 .
Total non-OPEC liquids production increased by 1.58 million b/d to a level of 49.42 million b/d from September to October , according to the latest figures of the IEA .
Average total liquids production of non-OPEC in 2008 from January to October was 49.50 million b/d , versus 49.45 million b/d in 2007 and 48.75 million b/d in 2006 .
5 ) OECD liquids demand - OECD liquids consumption in September 2008 was 45.46 million b/d , a decline of 1.85 million b/d year on year .
Average consumption from January to September 2008 was 46.34 million b/d , which is 1.11 million b/d lower than consumption in the same period in 2007 .
The decline is mainly a result of a decrease in oil consumption in the United States .
Consumption is 951,000 b/d lower on average in the US from January to September 2008 then in the same period last year .
In comparison , Mexican and Canadian consumption are almost flat relative to 2007 consumption .
6 ) Chinese & Indian liquids demand - Chinese liquids consumption averaged 7.28 million b/d from January to September 2008 according to the JODI database , an increase of only 50,000 b/d versus average 2007 January to September consumption of 7.23 million b/d .
In 2005 China consumed on average 6.27 million b/d , growing to 6.78 million b/d in 2006 and 7.29 million b/d in 2007 .
But growth has also been impacted here since July .
Liquids consumption in September was 1.04 million b/d lower than in July .
Consumption in India was 2.62 million b/d from January to September 2008 , versus an average of 2.43 million b/d in 2007 and 2.29 million b/d in 2006 .
7 ) World Liquids exports -
The exports database , which uses the methodology outlined in the oilwatch monthly , shows that annual worldwide exports are roughly in the order of 46.3 million b/d , 47.5 million b/d , 47.4 and 47.3 million b/d in 2004 , 2005 , 2006 and 2007 respectively .
From January to September 2008 the estimate suggests average world exports amounted to 47.56 million b/d. From January to September 2008 average non-OPEC exports were estimated to be 17.15 million b/d.
A decline of 0.74 million b/d from the 2007 proxy estimate of 17.89 million b/d .
A proxy estimate of exports for OPEC 13 ( including Iraq and Indonesia ) for 2004 gives a figure of 28.37 million b/d , increasing to 29.60 million b/d in 2005 , 29.76 million b/d in 2006 and declining to 29.46 million b/d in 2007 .
From January to September 2008 OPEC exports amounted to an average level of 30.41 million b/d .

The " apple " body shape that increases the risk of diabetes and heart disease may be accelerated by eating trans fat such as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil , according to new animal research at Wake Forest University School of Medicine .
" Diets rich in trans fat cause a redistribution of fat tissue into the abdomen and lead to a higher body weight even when the total dietary calories are controlled , " said Lawrence L. Rudel , Ph.D. , professor of pathology and biochemistry and head of the Lipid Sciences Research Program .
" What it says is that trans fat is worse than anticipated , " Rudel said .
" I was surprised . "
According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , consumption of saturated fat , trans fat , and dietary cholesterol raises low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , or " bad " cholesterol , levels , which increases the risk of coronary artery disease .
Kylie Kavanagh , D.V.M. , presented the findings today at the 66th annual Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in Washington , D.C.
She said that over six years , male monkeys fed a western - style diet that contains trans fat had a 7.2 percent increase in body weight , compared to a 1.8 percent increase in monkeys that ate monounsaturated fats , such as olive oil .
All that extra weight went to the abdomen , and some other body fat was redistributed to the abdomen .
Computed tomography ( CT ) scans showed that the monkeys on the diet containing trans fats had dramatically more abdominal fat than the monkeys on the monounsaturated fat .
" We measured the volume of fat using CT , " Kavanagh said .
" They deposited 30 percent more fat in their abdomen . "
The monkeys all were given the same amount of daily calories , with 35 percent of the calories coming from fat .
The amount of calories they got should only have been enough to maintain their weight , not increase it , Rudel said .
" We believed they could n't get obese because we did not give them enough calories to get fat . "

One group of monkeys got 8 percent of their calories from trans fat while the other group received those calories as monounsaturated fat .
The researchers said that this amount of trans fat is comparable to people who eat a lot of fried food .
" We conclude that in equivalent diets , trans fatty acid consumption increases weight gain , " said Kavanagh .
Over the entire course of the study , there was a small but significant difference in weight between the two groups .
" In the world of diabetes , everybody knows that just 5 percent weight loss makes enormous difference , " Kavanagh said .
" This little difference was biologically quite significant . "
Rudel said , " The study was specifically funded to look at the role of trans fatty acids in atherosclerosis . "
He said that at the time he got a grant from the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , there was not much evidence in the literature and no animal models that documented the hazards of trans fats , though there are data showing it was a risk factor for atherosclerosis .
advertisement
Kavanagh said the six - year length of the study was equivalent to 20 years in people .
According to the FDA , trans fat is found in vegetable shortenings , some margarines , crackers , cookies , snack foods , and other foods made with or fried in partially hydrogenated oils .
Unlike other fats , the majority of trans fat is formed when food manufacturers turn liquid oils into solid fats like shortening and hard margarine by adding hydrogen .
Since Jan. 1 , the FDA has required the amount of trans fat to be listed in the nutrition facts panel on all foods .
But the restaurant industry is exempt .
Other researchers on the American Diabetes Society report include Janice D. Wagner , Ph.D. , D.V.M. , John Jeffrey Carr , M.D. , Kate Jones , B.S. , Janet Sawyer , M.S. , and Kathryn Kelly . , B.S. , all from Wake Forest University School of Medicine .

Introduction to Python / Django tests : Fixtures ¶
In the first two posts of this series , we talked about how to get the basic infrastructure for your tests up and running .
You should have a file with doc tests and one with unit tests .
They should be linked into your django project with an __init__.py file .
If you were feeling adverterous you may have even added some real content to them .
Today we ’re going to start going down the road of getting some data into your tests .
This post will cover fixtures .
Fixtures are how you create a state for your database in your tests .
This will be my first post in the comparison between Unit tests and Doc tests .
I will focus on fixtures , but some other differences between the two may become relevant throughout the post , and I will address them in turn .
How to create a fixture ¶
Fixtures can go into a couple places , but generally it is a good idea to put them in your applications fixtures / directory .
This makes all of your test data self contained inside your app , so it can be run when it is distributed .
The loaddata command discussed further down specifies where fixtures can be placed to be loaded , if you ’re curious .
Before we go about trying to figure out how to use fixtures , we need to know how to make them .
Django ’s docs on this are pretty good .
Basically if you have an app that has data in the database , you can use the ./manage .py dumpdata < app > command to create a fixture from the current data in the database .
It ’s handy to note that you can use the -- format tag to specify the output format , and the -- indent command to make the output prettier .
My preferred command is # This assumes you are at the project level , right above your app .
# and that APP / fixtures / exists ./ manage .
py dumpdata APP -- format = yaml -- indent = 4 > APP / fixtures / APP . yaml
This makes for a really nice , readable fixture , so if you need to edit it later you can .
Go ahead and run this command in your project directory , substituting your app in the appropriate places .
Open the fixture if you want and take a peak inside .
It should be a nice readable version of your database , serialized into Yaml .
Note :
If you do n’t have PyYAML installed , it will say that your serialization format is n’t valid , sudo apt - get install python - yaml gets you the package on Ubuntu .
If not , you can remove the format option and it will default to JSON .
Testing your fixtures ( how meta of us ! ) ¶
Django also comes with a really neat tool to be able to test and update fixtures .
The testserver command allows you to run the development server , passing a fixture to load before it launches .
This allows you to run your code base against the fixture that you have , in a browser .
This seems really nice , but the killer feature of this command is that it keeps the database around after you kill the development server .
This means that you can load up a fixture , edit it in the admin or frontend , and then kill the server ; then run dumpdata against that database and get your updated fixture back out .
Pretty neat !
Note , your normal database name will be prefixed with test_ , so it does n’t overwrite your normal DB .
This is the one you want to get data out of .
( You may have to define it in your settings . py file to get dumpdata to use it .
This seems like a little bit of a hack , and maybe something could be done to make this easier . )
Fixtures in Doc tests ¶
In what will become a recurring trend , doing fixtures in Doc tests is a hack .
Doc tests are made to be a simple answer to a relatively simple problem , and fixtures are n’t a huge deal for them .
So a lot of the functionality that we get for free with Unit tests , has to be hacked into Doc tests .
I will just show how to do the basic things , because implementing anything beyond that is n’t very useful for any of us . >>> from django.core.management import call_command >>> call_command ( " loaddata " , " ' + ' fixturefile.json ' + ' " , verbosity = 0 ) In this snippet you are basically calling it the way it is called within Django .
Normally when you are using loaddata , you would be calling it as ./manage .py loaddata FIXTURE . .
Note that the loaddata docs talk about how to use loaddata normally .
There are a couple of downsides to this method ;
The test is very fragile , if the fixture breaks , all of your tests fail .
Also , you can really only call one fixtures at a time because there is no setUp and tearDown that will make sure your environment is the same for every test .
Doing things this way just makes writing tests a whole lot harder .
It is indeed a hack , and one that should n’t really be used unless you have a very good reason .
Generally in Doc tests , you would create your content as if you were on the command line .
This shows how doc tests are generally limited in their scope .
You go ahead and create the objects that you care about in the test explicitly , and then run your tests against them .
A simple example : >>> from mine .
models import Site >>> s = Site . objects .
create ( url = ' http://google.com' , query = ' test ' , title = ' test ' , content = ' lots of stuff ' ) >>> s . query ' test ' >>> s . save ( ) >>> pk_site = s . pk >>>
Site .
objects .
get ( pk = pk_site ) < Site : test > >>>
Site .
objects .
get ( pk = pk_site ) . delete ()
This tests creating , retrieving and deleting an object .
Not a lot of functionality , but if anything inside of the model saving code breaks you will know about it .
Django ’s Testcase ¶
The fixture story in Unit tests is much better , as you would expect .
However , before we go into how Unit tests use fixtures , there is something that I need to explain .
Because of the fact that Unit tests are classes , they can be subclassed just like any other Python class .
This means that Django has provided it ’s own Testcase class that we can inherit from and get some nice extra Django functionality .
The official docs has it really well documented .
You ’ll notice that Django ’s Testcase has a section for the Test Client and URLConf configuration .
We can safely skip those for the moment because they are geared towards testing views .
The relevant sections for us at the moment are the Fixture loading and Assertions .
I recommend that you actually read the entire testing doc , it is n’t that long , and is packed full of useful information .
However , knowing about all of the Assertions that are available to you will make testing a little bit easier .

U.S. policy is not about one individual , and no matter how much faith people place in President - elect Barack Obama , the policies he enacts will be fruit of a tree with many roots .
Among them : his personal politics and views , the disastrous realities his administration will inherit , and , of course , unpredictable future crises .
But the best immediate indicator of what an Obama administration might look like can be found in the people he surrounds himself with and who he appoints to his Cabinet .
And , frankly , when it comes to foreign policy , it is not looking good .
Obama has a momentous opportunity to do what he repeatedly promised over the course of his campaign : bring actual change .
But the more we learn about who Obama is considering for top positions in his administration , the more his inner circle resembles a staff reunion of President Bill Clinton ’s White House .
Although Obama brought some progressives on board early in his campaign , his foreign policy team is now dominated by the hawkish , old - guard Democrats of the 1990s .
This has been particularly true since Hillary Clinton conceded defeat in the Democratic primary , freeing many of her top advisors to join Obama ’s team .
" What happened to all this talk about change ? " a member of the Clinton foreign policy team recently asked the Washington Post .
" This is n’t lightly flavored with Clintons .
This is all Clintons , all the time . "
Amid the euphoria over Obama ’s election and the end of the Bush era , it is critical to recall what 1990s U.S. foreign policy actually looked like .
Bill Clinton ’s boiled down to a one - two punch from the hidden hand of the free market , backed up by the iron fist of U.S. militarism .
Clinton took office and almost immediately bombed Iraq ( ostensibly in retaliation for an alleged plot by Saddam Hussein to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush ) .
He presided over a ruthless regime of economic sanctions that killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis , and under the guise of the so - called No - Fly Zones in northern and southern Iraq , authorized the longest sustained U.S. bombing campaign since Vietnam .
Under Clinton , Yugoslavia was bombed and dismantled as part of what Noam Chomsky described as the " New Military Humanism . "
Sudan and Afghanistan were attacked , Haiti was destabilized and " free trade " deals like the North America Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade radically escalated the spread of corporate - dominated globalization that hurt U.S. workers and devastated developing countries .
Clinton accelerated the militarization of the so - called War on Drugs in Central and Latin America and supported privatization of U.S. military operations , giving lucrative contracts to Halliburton and other war contractors .
Meanwhile , U.S. weapons sales to countries like Turkey and Indonesia aided genocidal campaigns against the Kurds and the East Timorese .
The prospect of Obama ’s foreign policy being , at least in part , an extension of the Clinton Doctrine is real .
Even more disturbing , several of the individuals at the center of Obama ’s transition and emerging foreign policy teams were top players in creating and implementing foreign policies that would pave the way for projects eventually carried out under the Bush / Cheney administration .
With their assistance , Obama has already charted out several hawkish stances .
Among them :
— His plan to escalate the war in Afghanistan ;
— An Iraq plan that could turn into a downsized and rebranded occupation that keeps U.S. forces in Iraq for the foreseeable future ;
— His labeling of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard as a " terrorist organization ; "
— His pledge to use unilateral force inside of Pakistan to defend U.S. interests ;
— His position , presented before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , that Jerusalem " must remain undivided " — a remark that infuriated Palestinian officials and which he later attempted to reframe ;
— His plan to continue the War on Drugs , a backdoor U.S. counterinsurgency campaign in Central and Latin America ;
— His refusal to " rule out " using Blackwater and other armed private forces in U.S. war zones , despite previously introducing legislation to regulate these companies and bring them under U.S. law .
Obama did not arrive at these positions in a vacuum .
They were carefully crafted in consultation with his foreign policy team .
While the verdict is still out on a few people , many members of his inner foreign policy circle — including some who have received or are bound to receive Cabinet posts — supported the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
Some promoted the myth that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction .
A few have worked with the neoconservative Project for the New American Century , whose radical agenda was adopted by the Bush / Cheney administration .
And most have proven track records of supporting or implementing militaristic , offensive U.S. foreign policy .
" After a masterful campaign , Barack Obama seems headed toward some fateful mistakes as he assembles his administration by heeding the advice of Washington ’s Democratic insider community , a collective group that represents little ‘ change you can believe in , ’ " notes veteran journalist Robert Parry , the former Associated Press and Newsweek reporter who broke many of the stories in the Iran - Contra scandal in the 1980s .
As news breaks and speculation abounds about cabinet appointments , here are 20 people to watch as Obama builds the team who will shape U.S. foreign policy for at least four years :
Joe Biden
There was no stronger sign that Obama ’s foreign policy would follow the hawkish tradition of the Democratic foreign policy establishment than his selection of Sen.
Joe Biden as his running mate .
Much has been written on Biden ’s tenure as head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , but his role in the invasion and occupation of Iraq stands out .
Biden is not just one more Democratic lawmaker who now calls his vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq " mistaken ; " Biden was actually an important facilitator of the war .
In the summer of 2002 , when the United States was " debating " a potential attack on Iraq , Biden presided over hearings whose ostensible purpose was to weigh all existing options .
But instead of calling on experts whose testimony could challenge the case for war —
Iraq ’s alleged WMD possession and its supposed ties to al - Qaida — Biden ’s hearings treated the invasion as a foregone conclusion .
His refusal to call on two individuals in particular ensured that testimony that could have proven invaluable to an actual debate was never heard : Former Chief United Nations Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter and Hans von Sponeck , a 32 - year veteran diplomat and the former head of the U.N. ’s Iraq program .
Both men say they made it clear to Biden ’s office that they were ready and willing to testify ;
Ritter knew more about the dismantling of Iraq ’s WMD program than perhaps any other U.S. citizen and would have been in prime position to debunk the misinformation and outright lies being peddled by the White House .
Meanwhile , von Sponeck had just returned from Iraq , where he had observed Ansar al Islam rebels in the north of Iraq — the so - called al - Qaida connection — and could have testified that , rather than colluding with Saddam ’s regime , they were in a battle against it .
Moreover , he would have pointed out that they were operating in the U.S. - enforced safe haven of Iraqi Kurdistan .
" Evidence of al - Qaida / lraq collaboration does not exist , neither in the training of operatives nor in support to Ansar - al - Islam , " von Sponeck wrote in an Op - Ed published shortly before the July 2002 hearings .
" The U.S. Department of Defense and the CIA know perfectly well that today ’s Iraq poses no threat to anyone in the region , let alone in the United States .
To argue otherwise is dishonest . "
With both men barred from testifying , rather than eliciting an array of informed opinions , Biden ’s committee whitewashed Bush ’s lies and helped lead the country to war .
Biden himself promoted the administration ’s false claims that were used to justify the invasion of Iraq , declaring on the Senate floor , " [ Saddam Hussein ] possesses chemical and biological weapons and is seeking nuclear weapons . "
With the war underway , Biden was then the genius who passionately promoted the ridiculous plan to partition Iraq into three areas based on religion and ethnicity , attempting to Balkanize one of the strongest Arab states in the world .
" He ’s a part of the old Democratic establishment , " says retired Army Col .
Ann Wright , the State Department diplomat who reopened the U.S. embassy in Kabul in 2002 .
Biden , she says , has " had a long history with foreign affairs , [ but ] it ’s not the type of foreign affairs that I want . "
Rahm Emanuel
Obama ’s appointment of Illinois Congressman Rahm Emanuel as Chief of Staff is a clear sign that Clinton - era neoliberal hawks will be well - represented at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave .
A former senior Clinton advisor , Emanuel is a hard - line supporter of Israel ’s " targeted assassination " policy and actually volunteered to work with the Israeli Army during the 1991 Gulf War .
He is close to the right - wing Democratic Leadership Council and was the only member of the Illinois Democratic delegation in the Congress to vote for the invasion of Iraq .
Unlike many of his colleagues , Emanuel still defends his vote .
As chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2006 , Emanuel promoted the campaigns of 22 candidates , only one of who supported a swift withdrawal from Iraq , and denied crucial Party funding to anti-war candidates .
" As for Iraq policy , at the right time , we will have a position , " he said in December 2005 .
As Philip Giraldi recently pointed out on Antiwar.com , Emanuel " advocates increasing the size of the U.S. Army by 100,000 soldiers and creating a domestic spying organization like Britain ’s MI5 .
More recently , he has supported mandatory paramilitary national service for all Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 . "
While Obama has at times been critical of Clinton - era free trade agreements , Emanuel was one of the key people in the Clinton White House who brokered the successful passage of NAFTA .
Hillary Rodham Clinton
For all the buzz and speculation about the possibility that Sen.
Clinton may be named Secretary of State , most media coverage has focused on her rivalry with Obama during the primary , along with the prospect of her husband having to face the intense personal , financial and political vetting process required to secure a job in the new administration .
But the question of how Clinton would lead the operations at Foggy Bottom calls for scrutiny of her positions vis-a - vis Obama ’s stated foreign - policy goals .
Clinton was an ardent defender of her husband ’s economic and military war against Iraq throughout the 1990s , including the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 , which ultimately laid the path for President George W. Bush ’s invasion .
Later , as a U.S. senator , she not only voted to authorize the war , but aided the Bush administration ’s propaganda campaign in the lead - up to the invasion .
" Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock , his missile - delivery capability and his nuclear program , " Clinton said when rising to support the measure in October 2002 .
" He has also given aid , comfort and sanctuary to terrorists , including al - Qaida members … I want to insure that Saddam Hussein makes no mistake about our national unity and for our support for the president ’s efforts to wage America ’s war against terrorists and weapons of mass destruction . "
" The man who vowed to deliver us from 28 years of Bushes and Clintons has been stocking up on Clintonites , " New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd recently wrote .
" How , one may ask , can he put Hillary — who voted to authorize the Iraq war without even reading the intelligence assessment — in charge of patching up a foreign policy and a world riven by that war ? "
Beyond Iraq , Clinton shocked many and sparked official protests by Tehran at the United Nations when asked during the presidential campaign what she would do as president if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons .
" I want the Iranians to know that if I ’m the president , we will attack Iran , " she declared .
" In the next 10 years , during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel , we would be able to totally obliterate them . "
Clinton has not shied away from supporting offensive foreign policy tactics in the past .
Recalling her husband ’s weighing the decision of whether to attack Yugoslavia , she said in 1999 , " I urged him to bomb . …
You can not let this go on at the end of a century that has seen the major holocaust of our time .
What do we have NATO for if not to defend our way of life ? "
Madeleine Albright
While Obama ’s house is flush with Clintonian officials like former Secretary of State Warren Christopher , Defense Secretary William Perry , Director of the State Department Office of Policy Planning Greg Craig ( who was officially named Obama ’s White House Counsel ) and Navy Secretary Richard Danzig , perhaps most influential is Madeleine Albright , Bill Clinton ’s former Secretary of State and U.N. ambassador .
Albright recently served as a proxy for Obama , representing him at the G - 20 summit earlier this month .
Whether or not she is awarded an official role in the administration , Albright will be a major force in shaping Obama ’s foreign policy .
" It will take time to convince skeptics that the promotion of democracy is not a mask for imperialism or a recipe for the kind of chaos we have seen in the Persian Gulf , " Albright recently wrote .
" And it will take time to establish the right identity for America in a world that has grown suspicious of all who claim a monopoly on virtue and that has become reluctant to follow the lead of any one country . "
Albright should know .
She was one of the key architects in the dismantling of Yugoslavia during the 1990s .
In the lead - up to the 1999 " Kosovo war , " she oversaw the U.S. attempt to coerce the Yugoslav government to deny its own sovereignty in return for not being bombed .
Albright demanded that the Yugoslav government sign a document that would have been unacceptable to any sovereign nation .
Known as the Rambouillet Accord , it included a provision that would have guaranteed U.S. and NATO forces " free and unrestricted passage and unimpeded access throughout " all of Yugoslavia — not just Kosovo — while also seeking to immunize those occupation forces " from any form of arrest , investigation or detention by the authorities in [ Yugoslavia ] . "
Moreover , it would have granted the occupiers " the use of airports , roads , rails and ports without payment . "
Similar to Bush ’s Iraq plan years later , the Rambouillet Accord mandated that the economy of Kosovo " shall function in accordance with free - market principles . "
When Yugoslavia refused to sign the document , Albright and others in the Clinton administration unleashed the 78 - day NATO bombing of Serbia , which targeted civilian infrastructure .
( Prior to the attack , Albright said the U.S. government felt " the Serbs need a little bombing . " )
She and the Clinton administration also supported the rise to power in Kosovo of a terrorist mafia that carried out its own ethnic - cleansing campaign against the province ’s minorities .
Perhaps Albright ’s most notorious moment came with her enthusiastic support of the economic war against the civilian population of Iraq .
When confronted by Lesley Stahl of “ 60 Minutes ” that the sanctions were responsible for the deaths of " a half - million children … more children than died in Hiroshima , " Albright responded , " I think this is a very hard choice , but the price — we think the price is worth it . "
( While defending the policy , Albright later called her choice of words " a terrible mistake , hasty , clumsy , and wrong . " )
Richard Holbrooke
Like Albright , Holbrooke will have major sway over U.S. policy , whether or not he gets an official job .
A career diplomat since the Vietnam War , Holbrooke ’s most recent government post was as President Clinton ’s ambassador to the U.N.
Among the many violent policies he helped implement and enforce was the U.S. - backed Indonesian genocide in East Timor .
Holbrooke was an Assistant Secretary of State in the late 1970s at the height of the slaughter and was the point man on East Timor for the Carter Administration .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
According to Brad Simpson , director of the Indonesia and East Timor Documentation Project at the National Security Archive at George Washington University , " It was Holbrooke and Zbigniew Brzezinski [ another top Obama advisor ] , both now leading lights in the Democratic Party , who played point in trying to frustrate the efforts of congressional human - rights activists to try and condition or stop U.S. military assistance to Indonesia , and in fact accelerated the flow of weapons to Indonesia at the height of the genocide . "
Holbrooke , too , was a major player in the dismantling of Yugoslavia and praised the bombing of Serb Television , which killed 16 media workers , as a significant victory .
( The man who ordered that bombing , now - retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark , is another Obama foreign policy insider who could end up in his cabinet .
While Clark is known for being relatively progressive on social issues , as Supreme Allied Commander of NATO , he ordered bombings and attacks that Amnesty International labeled war crimes . )
Like many in Obama ’s foreign policy circle , Holbrooke also supported the Iraq war .
In early 2003 , shortly after then - Secretary of State Colin Powell ’s speech to the UN , where he presented the administration ’s fraud - laden case for war to the UN ( a speech Powell has since called a " blot " on his reputation ) , Holbrooke said : " It was a masterful job of diplomacy by Colin Powell and his colleagues , and it does not require a second vote to go to war .
…
Saddam is the most dangerous government leader in the world today , he poses a threat to the region , he could pose a larger threat if he got weapons of mass destruction deployed , and we have a legitimate right to take action . "
Dennis Ross
Middle East envoy for both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton , Ross was one of the primary authors of Obama ’s aforementioned speech before AIPAC this summer .
He cut his teeth working under famed neoconservative Paul Wolfowitz at the Pentagon in the 1970s and worked closely with the Project for the New American Century .
Ross has been a staunch supporter of Israel and has fanned the flames for a more hostile stance toward Iran .
As the lead U.S. negotiator between Israel and numerous Arab nations under Clinton , Ross ’ team acted , in the words of one U.S. official who worked under him , as " Israel ’s lawyer . "
" The ‘ no surprises ’ policy , under which we had to run everything by Israel first , stripped our policy of the independence and flexibility required for serious peacemaking , " wrote U.S. diplomat Aaron David Miller in 2005 .
" If we could n’t put proposals on the table without checking with the Israelis first , and refused to push back when they said no , how effective could our mediation be ?
Far too often , particularly when it came to Israeli - Palestinian diplomacy , our departure point was not what was needed to reach an agreement acceptable to both sides but what would pass with only one — Israel . "
After the Clinton White House , Ross worked for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , a hawkish pro-Israel think tank , and for FOX News , where he repeatedly pressed for war against Iraq .
Martin Indyk
Founder of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , Indyk spent years working for AIPAC and served as Clinton ’s ambassador to Israel and Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs , while also playing a major role in developing U.S. policy toward Iraq and Iran .
In addition to his work for the U.S. government , he has worked for the Israeli government and with PNAC .
" Barack Obama has painted himself into a corner by appealing to the most hard - line , pro-Israel elements in this country , " Ali Abunimah , founder of ElectronicInifada.net , recently told Amy Goodman of Democracy Now ! , describing Indyk and Dennis Ross as " two of the most pro-Israel officials from the Clinton era , who are totally distrusted by Palestinians and others across the Middle East , because they ’re seen as lifelong advocates for Israeli positions . "
Anthony Lake
Clinton ’s former National Security Advisor was an early supporter of Obama and one of the few top Clintonites to initially back the president - elect .
Lake began his foreign policy work in the U.S. Foreign Service during Vietnam , working with Henry Kissinger on the " September Group , " a secret team tasked with developing a military strategy to deliver a " savage , decisive blow against North Vietnam . "
Decades later , after working for various administrations , Lake " was the main force behind the U.S. invasion of Haiti in the mid-Clinton years , " according to veteran journalist Allan Nairn , whose groundbreaking reporting revealed U.S. support for Haitian death squads in the 1990s .
" They brought back Aristide essentially in political chains , pledged to support a World Bank / IMF overhaul of the economy , which resulted in an increase in malnutrition deaths among Haitians , and set the stage for the current ongoing political disaster in Haiti . "
Clinton nominated Lake as CIA Director , but he failed to win Senate confirmation .
Lee Hamilton
Hamilton is a former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and was co-chairman of both the Iraq Study Group and 9/11 Commission .
Robert Parry , who has covered Hamilton ’s career extensively , recently ran a piece on Consortium News that characterized him this way : " Whenever the Republicans have a touchy national - security scandal to put to rest , their favorite Democratic investigator is Lee Hamilton .
…
Hamilton ’s carefully honed skill for balancing truth against political comity has elevated him to the status of a Washington Wise Man . "
Susan Rice
Former Assistant Secretary of Sate Susan Rice , who served on Bill Clinton ’s National Security Council , is a potential candidate for the post of ambassador to the U.N. or as a deputy national security advisor .
She , too , promoted the myth that Saddam had WMDs .
" It ’s clear that Iraq poses a major threat , " she said in 2002 .
" It ’s clear that its weapons of mass destruction need to be dealt with forcefully , and that ’s the path we ’re on . "
( After the invasion , discussing Saddam ’s alleged possession of WMDs , she said , " I do n’t think many informed people doubted that . " )
Rice has also been a passionate advocate for a U.S. military attack against Sudan over the Darfur crisis .
In an op - ed co-authored with Anthony Lake , she wrote , " The United States , preferably with NATO involvement and African political support , would strike Sudanese airfields , aircraft and other military assets .
It could blockade Port Sudan , through which Sudan ’s oil exports flow .
Then U.N. troops would deploy — by force , if necessary , with U.S. and NATO backing . "
John Brennan
A longtime CIA official and former head of the National Counterterrorism Center , Brennan is one of the coordinators of Obama ’s intelligence transition team and a top contender for either CIA Director or Director of National Intelligence .
He was also recently described by Glenn Greenwald as " an ardent supporter of torture and one of the most emphatic advocates of FISA expansions and telecom immunity . "
While claiming to oppose waterboarding , labeling it " inconsistent with American values " and " something that should be prohibited , " Brennan has simultaneously praised the results achieved by " enhanced interrogation " techniques .
" There has been a lot of information that has come out from these interrogation procedures that the agency has , in fact , used against the real hard - core terrorists , " Brennan said in a 2007 interview .
" It has saved lives .
And let ’s not forget , these are hardened terrorists who have been responsible for 9/11 , who have shown no remorse at all for the death of 3,000 innocents . "
Brennan has described the CIA ’s extraordinary rendition program — the government - run kidnap - and - torture program enacted under Clinton — as an absolutely vital tool .
" I have been intimately familiar now over the past decade with the cases of rendition that the U.S. Government has been involved in , " he said in a December 2005 interview .
" And I can say without a doubt that it has been very successful as far as producing intelligence that has saved lives . "
Brennan is currently the head of Analysis Corporation , a private intelligence company that was recently implicated in the breach of Obama and Sen. John McCain ’s passport records .
He is also the current chairman of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance ( INSA ) , a trade association of private intelligence contractors who have dramatically increased their role in sensitive U.S. national security operations .
( Current Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell is former chairman of the INSA . )
Jami Miscik
Miscik , who works alongside Brennan on Obama ’s transitional team , was the CIA ’s Deputy Director for Intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war .
She was one of the key officials responsible for sidelining intel that contradicted the official line on WMD , while promoting intel that backed it up .
" When the administration insisted on an intelligence assessment of Saddam Hussein ’s relationship to al - Qaida , Miscik blocked the skeptics ( who were later vindicated ) within the CIA ’s Mideast analytical directorate and instructed the less - skeptical counterterrorism analysts to ‘ stretch to the maximum the evidence you had , ’ " journalist Spencer Ackerman recently wrote in the Washington Independent .
" It ’s hard to think of a more egregious case of sacrificing sound intelligence analysis in order to accommodate the strategic fantasies of an administration . …
The idea that Miscik is helping staff Obama ’s top intelligence picks is most certainly not change we can believe in . "
What ’s more , she went on to a lucrative post as the Global Head of Sovereign Risk for the now - bankrupt Lehman Brothers .
John Kerry and Bill Richardson
Both Sen. Kerry and Gov. Richardson have been identified as possible contenders for Secretary of State .
While neither is likely to be as hawkish as Hillary Clinton , both have taken pro-war positions .
Kerry promoted the WMD lie and voted to invade Iraq .
" Why is Saddam Hussein attempting to develop nuclear weapons when most nations do n’t even try ? "
Kerry asked on the Senate floor in October 2002 .
" According to intelligence , Iraq has chemical and biological weapons …
Iraq is developing unmanned aerial vehicles capable of delivering chemical and biological warfare agents . "
Richardson , whose Iraq plan during his 2008 presidential campaign was more progressive and far - reaching than Obama ’s , served as Bill Clinton ’s ambassador to the UN .
In this capacity , he supported Clinton ’s December 1998 bombing of Baghdad and the U.S. - led sanctions against Iraq .
" We think this man is a threat to the international community , and he threatens a lot of the neighbors in his region and future generations there with anthrax and VX , " Richardson told an interviewer in February 1998 .
While Clinton ’s Secretary of Energy , Richardson publicly named Wen Ho Lee , a scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , as a target in an espionage investigation .
Lee was accused of passing nuclear secrets to the Chinese government .
Lee was later cleared of those charges and won a settlement against the U.S. government .
Robert Gates
Washington consensus is that Obama will likely keep Robert Gates , George W. Bush ’s Defense Secretary , as his own Secretary of Defense .
While Gates has occasionally proved to be a stark contrast to former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , he would hardly represent a break from the policies of the Bush administration .
Quite the opposite ; according to the Washington Post , in the interest of a " smooth transition , " Gates " has ordered hundreds of political appointees at the Pentagon canvassed to see whether they wish to stay on in the new administration , has streamlined policy briefings and has set up suites for President - elect Barack Obama ’s transition team just down the hall from his own E- ring office . "
The Post reports that Gates could stay on for a brief period and then be replaced by Richard Danzig , who was Clinton ’s Secretary of the Navy .
Other names currently being tossed around are Democratic Sen. Jack Reed , Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel ( a critic of the Iraq occupation ) and Republican Sen. Richard Lugar , who served alongside Biden on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Ivo H. Daalder
Daalder was National Security Council Director for European Affairs under President Clinton .
Like other Obama advisors , he has worked with the Project for the New American Century and signed a 2005 letter from PNAC to Congressional leaders , calling for an increase in U.S. ground troops in Iraq and beyond .
Sarah Sewall
Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Assistance during the Clinton administration , Sewall served as a top advisor to Obama during the campaign and is almost certain to be selected for a post in his administration .
In 2007 , Sewall worked with the U.S. military and Army Gen. David Petraeus , writing the introduction to the University of Chicago edition of the Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual .
She was criticized for this collaboration by Tom Hayden , who wrote , " the Petraeus plan draws intellectual legitimacy from Harvard ’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy , whose director , Sarah Sewall , proudly embraces an ‘ unprecedented collaboration [ as ] a human rights center partnered with the armed forces . ’ ”
" Humanitarians often avoid wading into the conduct of war for fear of becoming complicit in its purpose , " she wrote in the introduction .
" ’ The field manual requires engagement precisely from those who fear that its words lack meaning . "
Michele Flournoy
Flournoy and former Clinton Deputy Defense Secretary John
White are co-heading Obama ’s defense transition team .
Flournoy was a senior Clinton appointee at the Pentagon .
She currently runs the Center for a New American Security , a center - right think - tank .
There is speculation that Obama could eventually name her as the first woman to serve as defense secretary .
As the Wall Street Journal recently reported : " While at CNAS , Flournoy helped to write a report that called for reducing the open - ended American military commitment in Iraq and replacing it with a policy of ‘ conditional engagement ’ there .
Significantly , the paper rejected the idea of withdrawing troops according to the sort of a fixed timeline that Obama espoused during the presidential campaign .
Obama has in recent weeks signaled that he was willing to shelve the idea , bringing him more in line with Flournoy ’s thinking . "
Flournoy has also worked with the neoconservative Project for the New American Century .
Wendy Sherman and Tom Donilon
Currently employed at Madeline Albright ’s consulting firm , the Albright Group , Sherman worked under Albright at the State Department , coordinating U.S. policy on North Korea .
She is now coordinating the State Department transition team for Obama .
Tom Donilon , her co-coordinator , was Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and Chief of Staff at the State Department under Clinton .
Interestingly , Sherman and Donilon both have ties to Fannie Mae that did n’t make it onto their official bios on Obama ’s change.gov website .
" Donilon was Fannie ’s general counsel and executive vice president for law and policy from 1999 until the spring of 2005 , a period during which the company was rocked by accounting problems , " reports the Wall Street Journal .
***
While many of the figures at the center of Obama ’s foreign policy team are well - known , two of its most important members have never held national elected office or a high - profile government position .
While they cannot be characterized as Clinton - era hawks , it will be important to watch Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert , co-coordinators of the Obama foreign policy team .
From 2000 to 2005 , McDonough served as foreign policy advisor to Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and worked extensively on the use - of - force authorizations for the attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq , both of which Daschle supported .
From 1996 to 1999 , McDonough was a professional staff member of the House International Relations Committee during the debate over the bombing of Yugoslavia .
More recently , he was at the Center for American Progress working under John Podesta , Clinton ’s former chief of staff and the current head of the Obama transition .
Mark Lippert is a close personal friend of Obama’s .
He has worked for Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy , as well as the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Democratic Policy Committee .
He is a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve and spent a year in Iraq working intelligence for the Navy SEALs .
" According to those who ’ve worked closely with Lippert , " Robert Dreyfuss recently wrote in The Nation , " he is a conservative , cautious centrist who often pulled Obama to the right on Iraq , Iran and the Middle East and who has been a consistent advocate for increased military spending .
‘ Even before Obama announced for the presidency , Lippert wanted Obama to be seen as tough on Iran , ’ says a lobbyist who ’s worked the Iran issue on Capitol Hill , ‘ He ’s clearly more hawkish than the senator . ’ "

Barack Obama campaigned on a pledge to bring change to Washington .
" I do n’t want to just end the war , " he said early this year .
" I want to end the mindset that got us into war . "
That is going to be very difficult if Obama employs a foreign policy team that was central to creating that mindset , before and during the presidency of George W. Bush .
" Twenty - three senators and 133 House members who voted against the war — and countless other notable individuals who spoke out against it and the dubious claims leading to war — are apparently not even being considered for these crucial positions , " observes Sam Husseini of the Institute for Public Accuracy .
This includes dozens of former military and intelligence officials who spoke out forcefully against the war and continue to oppose militaristic policy , as well as credible national security experts who have articulated their visions for a foreign policy based on justice .

Second to the presidency , Proposition 8 is arguably the most important vote in the nation this November .
Authored by religious groups , Proposition 8 overturns the California Supreme Court ’s decision granting same - sex couples marriage equality , and amends the state constitution so that marriage can only be defined as union between a man and a woman .
Recently married , my partner and I have donated time and money to the No On Prop 8 campaign .
We ’ve called upon our family and friends to do as much as they can .
We ’ve distributed fliers and signs around our neighborhood , and have tried to make an impact in our workplace .
But we wanted to do something more .
I ’ve made a No On Prop 8 video and have posted it on online .
I ’m not so naive as to think it will make a huge difference , or even a small one , but if I can get one more person to donate time or money , or get down off of that fence , then it will have been worth it .
I think many California voters do n’t really know who Proposition 8 ’s biggest supporters are , or their core values .
In the video I try to draw attention to that , in the hopes that making the decision to vote No on Prop 8 is an easier one .
Some of Proposition 8 ’s biggest supporters include
( I will not link to them as not to send them traffic ) :
Concerned Women for America
Focus on the Family
American Family Association
The Knights of Columbus
Members of the Mormon Church
( urged by their leaders , they have donated over $ 18 million )
For a complete list visit Californians Against Hate or the LA Times .
Please donate time or donate money if you have not already done so .
Or volunteer for No On Prop 8 ’s Election Visibility program on Election Day November 4th .
And finally , I ’d like to send my deepest thanks to Chuck Smith , who was so gracious with his time to provide the voiceover in this video .
Please contact me if you have some work to send Chuck ’s way .

Social Services chief 's husband was drug - addicted violent terrorist
Boss : Lisa Christensen , head of Norfolk children 's services
A Social Services chief who played a key role in the forcible adoption of three children is married to a convicted terrorist with a history of drink and drug abuse .
Lisa Christensen , director of children ’s services in Norfolk , is the wife of Jack Prescott , who was given a 15 - year prison sentence for involvement in a bomb attack on the home of a Tory Cabinet Minister .
Prescott , 64 – a self - confessed former heroin addict and thief – was a founder member of the Angry Brigade , Britain ’s only home - grown urban terrorist group , which carried out 25 attacks on Government buildings , embassies and corporations .
His past has come to light because he was recently convicted of assaulting Ms Christensen .
She failed to tell Norfolk County Council about her husband ’s violent past when she was appointed head of Social Services in 2002 .
Two years later , she became the authority ’s £ 120,000 - a- year director of children ’s services with responsibility for schools , child protection and young people in care .
In that role , she approved the forced removal of Mark and Nicky Webster ’s three children , all then under five – a decision condemned by Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb as ‘ an appalling miscarriage of justice ’ and which has been highlighted by The Mail on Sunday .
The Websters fought a long battle to prove they had not harmed their children .
Last year , experts agreed that leg injuries suffered by one youngster were due not to physical abuse but to a disorder that stopped him eating anything other than soya milk .
Husband : Jack Prescott under arrest in 1971 .
The couple , who have since had another child , are now making legal history by trying to reverse the adoption of their three older children .
Mr Prescott ’s past was revealed last week when he made a series of drunken phone calls to his wife ’s office , following a court case in which he admitted assaulting her during a row at the family home .
In one call , he told Ms Christensen ’s secretary that he had computer memory sticks and confidential files relating to scandals about children in care in the county .
Although a police investigation concluded that he held no such information , Ms Christensen , 52 , was embarrassed and upset by the calls .
She is understood to have felt obliged at this point to tell town hall chiefs about her husband ’s criminal record .
The couple , who married in 1992 , are now separated , although they are still listed at the same address on the electoral roll .
Neighbours in the Norfolk village of Mattishall , where the couple have a £ 350,000 detached Victorian cottage , said they were living together until just a few weeks ago .
Angry Brigade attack on the Minister 's house
One woman , who declined to be named , said : ‘ Those of us who knew him fairly well were aware he has a problem with alcohol .
It was something he ’s quite open about .
But it ’s a real shock to hear he ’s been violent as well . ’
Another friend said : ‘ He was certainly living with Lisa until the incident when the police were called .
I think she threw him out after that , but whether permanently or not
I do n’t know . ’
Prescott was considered highly dangerous as a result of his terrorist exploits and when he was sentenced at the Old Bailey in 1971 the judge , Mr Justice Melford Stevenson , told the painter and decorator he had been convicted of complicity ‘ in the most evil conspiracy I have ever had to deal with ’ .
When he was arrested over the bomb plot , Prescott was on parole from prison , where he had been serving five years for firearms offences .
Then 27 , he already had convictions for theft , housebreaking and assault but his sentence on the terrorism charges was later cut from 15 years to ten by the Court of Appeal .
Unlike other members of the Angry Brigade , most of whom were middle - class and university - educated , Prescott came from a staunchly working - class Scottish background .
Born in Dunfermline , he was brought up in an orphanage after the death of
his mother .
He committed his first offence , the theft of a bicycle , at 14 and became a heroin addict .
He told the jury at his terrorism trial : ‘ I was taking eight grains of heroin and other drugs every day and I sold all my personal possessions to buy drugs . ’
In November 1970 , the Angry Brigade , which embraced an anarchistic , anti-capitalist ideology , exploded a device under a BBC van at the Miss World contest .
Shortly afterwards , a document was delivered to a London newspaper .
Headed ‘ Communique No1 ’ , it claimed responsibility for the outrage .
Two more bombs were detonated outside the North London home of Employment Secretary Robert Carr and this was followed by further attacks on political targets .
No one was killed in the campaign but one person was injured .
The cell was broken up when detectives raided a rented flat in Stoke Newington , North London .
Five of the group were convicted of conspiracy but no one was ever found guilty of planting the bombs .
After serving his sentence , however , Prescott wrote to Carr and his family to apologise for his role in leaving the bombs at his home .
Mr Prescott is now in custody after Thetford magistrates heard he slapped his wife several times on the nose and cheeks , leaving her uninjured but with a tingling feeling in her face .
The court was told he had alcohol and mental health problems and should be given credit for pleading guilty .
He will be sentenced on December 22 .
Last night , Norfolk County Council chief executive David
White said : ‘ Lisa Christensen was still a schoolgirl when the man who later became her husband was arrested in 1971 and the couple did n’t meet until long after he had served his sentence .
‘ We rightly require job candidates to supply information about any criminal convictions they may hold but that does not apply to their partners and Lisa did not share that information with us when she was appointed , probably because it is something that happened more than 35 years ago .
‘ I am sad for her and her family that Jack ’s personal demons should now be a source of such trauma . ’
A council spokesman added : ‘ We only became aware of Jack Prescott ’s past last week following the domestic assault which led to him being arrested and appearing in court . ’
Ms Christensen said : ‘ This is a very sad matter for me and my family and we sincerely hope that expert treatment will be offered to Jack and taken up by him . ’
Other members of the Angry Brigade have disappeared from view over the years .
But Angela Mason , who was tried and acquitted of planting bombs , is
a former leader of gay rights group Stonewall and now works for the Government as national adviser at the Improvement and Development Agency for local government .
Chris Bott , who was also acquitted , was marketing manager of the
ill - fated Left - wing newspaper News on Sunday , which closed after a few months in 1987 .
He lives in France .

BUFFALO , N.Y .  Willie Evans does n't know if his mind is failing or whether he 's repressed the memories of what happened 50 years ago .
For the life of him , Evans is unable to remember the fateful team meeting at which he felt the bite of racism and learned about the power of friendship to overcome it .
If the details have faded , it does n't matter .
When his University at Buffalo teammates retell the story , they can place exactly where Evans was sitting in the classroom when the team unanimously rejected a chance to play in the 1958 Tangerine Bowl , the school 's first - and it turns out , only - bowl bid .
" Well , I 'm getting old , " said Evans , a former coach and physical education director for Buffalo schools who turns 71 this month .
" Maybe , I 've blocked it out .
You really do n't understand how your subconscious works all the time or your conscious .
But I really draw a blank . "
Evans was the star halfback on the ' 58 Buffalo team which finished 8 - 1 to claim the Lambert Cup - awarded to the top small school in the East .
The school initially accepted the Tangerine Bowl invitation .
But there proved to be a problem .
Not long after the Bulls agreed to play , Tangerine Bowl officials informed Buffalo that the local school district , which operated the host stadium in Orlando , Fla. , barred integrated games .
The players were left to decide whether to play without Evans and teammate Mike Wilson - the only two African - Americans on the team .
It was quickly evident which way the players were leaning .
The vote was taken before ballots could even be distributed .
" It was , ' Shall we leave the Italians home ?
Oh my God , really ? '
There was a lot of anger , " former offensive tackle Jack Dempsey said .
" We just threw the ballots on the floor and left .
It was , ' Let 's get out of here and go get a beer . " '
Quarterback Joe Oliverio remembers how infuriated he was .
" They insulted two of our teammates , and we were going to hit them back between the ears by refusing to go without our teammates , " he said .
History will show that East Texas State defeated Missouri Valley 26 - 7 in the Tangerine Bowl that year .
To the Bulls , they had scored a big victory , too .
" Someone asked me if we ever talk about the incompleteness of the season because we did n't go as far as we could 've , " said Phil Bamford , who doubled as an offensive lineman and linebacker .
" I think now looking back , if we had given in , caved in , gone to the game and won the game , we would 've never had the camaraderie we have now .
We would 've always felt we let our buddies down . "
And Evans was definitely present for that meeting , his teammates said .
" Absolutely , I can picture where he was sitting and Mike Wilson , " Dempsey said .
" I can remember walking out and players putting their arms around ( Evans ) .
... I can remember it vividly .
It was n't like hearts and flowers .
We just walked out , let 's get out of here .
Screw it . "
For Evans , his first memory of learning of what had happened came a day later , when he picked up the newspaper to find his and Wilson 's picture on the front page beneath a headline , " UB Turns Down Bid To Tangerine Bowl . "
" I started reading it and said , ' Damn , this is weird , " ' Evans said .
Evans grew up in an integrated neighborhood in Buffalo , a multiethnic manufacturing city at the time , with a lively downtown core .
Evans does n't recall much in the way of racial tensions growing up , though he vividly remembers seeing the graphic coverage of Emmett Till 's 1955 slaying in Mississippi that helped to mobilize the civil right 's movement .
But that occurred in the South , a far - away place for Evans , who was voted student president of his integrated grammar school , and attended a high school in the predominantly Polish part of town .
He played basketball and football on integrated teams .
And when the assistant principal attempted to track down Evans and his friends for cutting class to buy doughnuts at a Polish bakery around the corner , the owner , Ziggy , would let them sneak out the back way to elude being caught .
It was n't a perfect life .
Black men in his neighborhood who had returned from World War II faced barriers to being considered for civil service jobs .
And yet Evans had n't personally experienced such flat - out bigotry until Buffalo got the Tangerine Bowl bid .
The experience affected him personally in some ways , leading Evans to avoid visiting the South for many years despite having many relatives in Virginia and Mississippi .
" It was n't a grudge .
It was an ' I do n't care ' attitude , " Evans said .
" I just did n't want to deal with it . "
Wilson , his African - American teammate who was a backup on defense , died several years ago .
It was n't until the early 1990s , when Buffalo was scheduled to play a game against Central Florida in Orlando , that Evans accepted the team 's invitation to make the trip .
Perhaps it 's some sort of cosmic karma , but 50 years later the Bulls ( 5 - 4 ) - after years of futility and a stretch in which the school pulled football altogether - are in contention to earn a bowl bid this season .
The '58 Bulls get together fairly often and there 's talk of another reunion if Buffalo gets a postseason bid .
This year 's team is split about evenly between African - Americans and whites , is led by a black coach , Turner Gill , and a program headed by a black athletic director , Warde Manuel .
Evans was interviewed on Election Day , hours before the ballots were counted and Barack Obama became the first African - American elected to the presidency .
Sitting at his dining room table in a well - appointed condominium in a tony part of the city - just around the corner from where he went to grammar school - Evans reveled in America 's transformation .
The opportunity to cast a ballot for Obama outweighed the outcome , Evans said , because what mattered most was that a black man had earned the right to win or lose the race for president .
And that is all Evans and his teammates were asking for all those years ago - the chance to succeed or fail on an even playing field .
" Being confronted with the situation of not being allowed to play because you 're black , I 'm saying to myself , ' Well , I did n't do nothing to these folks , " ' Evans said .
" In talking with the fellas , we laugh about it now .
And we sum it up and say , ' It was just dumb .
It was just dumb . " '

The story revolves around a European - based military unit known as Global Integrated Joint Operating Entity ( G.I.J.O.E. ) , which is a hi-tech , international force of special operatives that takes on an evil organization led by a notorious arms dealer .
G.I. Joe : Rise of Cobra Character Posters

Joe “ also stars Brendan Fraser as Gung Ho , Rachel Nichols as Scarlett , Karolina Kurkova as Cover Girl , Byung - Hun Lee as Storm Shadow , Dennis Quaid as Hawk , Christopher Eccleston as Destro , Arnold Vosloo as Zartan , Adewale Akinnuoye - Agbaje as Heavy Duty and Saïd Taghmaoui as Breaker .
The movie is scheduled for an August 7 , 2009 release .
The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , yesterday said the government 's counter - terrorism strategy had to extend to challenging non-violent extremist groups that " skirt the fringes of the law ... to promote hate - filled ideologies " .
Smith did not name them , but she urged local authorities and the police to tackle extremist groups that were targeting mosques and community centres to create the idea that being Muslim and being British were incompatible .
" They may not explicitly promote violence , but they can create a climate of fear and distrust where violence becomes more likely , " she told a London conference of more than 700 local authority , police and community leaders discussing ways to prevent violent extremism .
" These are the groups that fail to speak out and condemn violence when any reasonable person would be outraged . "
Smith added that both the far right and those " peddling their particular brand of antidemocratic ideology in the guise of religion " were " trying to create the idea that being Muslim and being British are incompatible " .
The home secretary said young Muslims were having to put up with threats , intimidation and general abuse and cited a case in Derby where an extremist group sought to take over a community centre .
Smith and the communities secretary , Hazel Blears , told the second annual conference on the government 's programme to prevent violent extremism that a further £ 13.8 m would be made available to disrupt radicalisers , challenge the rhetoric of extremists and support vulnerable individuals locally .
A project that identifies individuals at risk of getting swept up in violent extremism is also to be expanded .
So far it has supported 100 individuals at two pilot sites in London and the north - west , and it is to be expanded so that it operates at 25 sites in 12 police force areas by next year .
Blears said that the programme to prevent violent extremism had so far reached more than 40,000 people since it started in April 2007 .
She said that it was now time to " focus on the hard - edged debate " , arguing that in some places local authorities had used the first year of the programme to understand the makeup of their communities , make the first links and build trust and confidence .
It was now important to move on to a debate that openly addressed the challenge of violent extremism : " In a small minority of cases , that 's taking longer than it should .
I recognise that it can be uncomfortable .
In some cases it will take political leadership to get things moving .
But it can and must be done , " said Blears .

Cbanks will need to oil and dust off their Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœGutenberg printing pressesÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , so that they can keep up with cash demand ( FED , BOJ , ECB and BOC ) .
Global policy makers are busily injecting funds to stem the financial crisis .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcockroach theoryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ continues to rattle consumer confidence and aiding Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœrisk aversion trading Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
All this as Bernanke favors Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœtarget loansÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ over interest rate cuts .
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 10 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Further evidence yesterday proves that the US housing markets continue to retreat .
Some analysts hoped and prayed that that the housing markets may have hit bottom already .
The balloon remains deflated as a new low on housing starts was achieved last month .
Only +895 k new homes were under construction vs. +940 k , m/m. Realists do not expect a material improvement anytime soon .
Despite US mortgage rates easing on the back of tighter GSE spreads after PaulsonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s rescue plan .
The market has offset this by Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœtighter loan term agreementsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ being implemented .
Hoarding of cash coupled with interbank funding pressures can only make it tougher for potential consumers to access credit .
Other US data faired no better , US housing permits fell in Aug. ( 2nd consecutive month ) , as builders continue to scale back activity due to reduced demand and a large inventory buildup ( +854 k permits , down - 8.9 % m / m from July ) .
This is the lowest level in 18 - years as both single and multi-units construction declined .
With banks remaining fearful of further bankruptcies , one can expect borrowing costs to remain elevated .
The net effect should have mortgage regulations tighten further , thus reducing housing affordability and the number of homebuyers on the market and lengthen the recovery period for this housing debacle .
Bernanke has chosen the route of cash injections and foregone interest rate manipulation .
To date , the Fed has managed liquidity injections via swapping out Treasuries for riskier assets pledged as collateral .
But now , Treasury is issuing more ( Issuance of 40 b 1 - month bills ) for the express purpose of floating balance sheet expansion at the Fed ( the reserves have become depleted ) .
Seeking more may be a sign that Bernanke and Co. expects financial market volatility to require massive intervention for a long time yet .
This action will directly impact the inflation question .
They are uncertain about the trade - off between monetizing debts in their balance sheet expansion vs. the potentially Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdeflationary forces of asset price declinesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ ( pressurizing global growth even further ) .
Uncertainty over how these forces may interact may well explain why the Fed remained concerned for the outlook of inflation in their communiquÃ ƒ
Â© this week .
Stagflation scenario remains intact !
The US$ currently is lower against the EUR +0.52 % , GBP +0.16 % , CHF +0.15 % and higher against JPY - 0.15 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.98 % and AUD + 1.57 % .
The loonie has struggled as Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœrisk aversionÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading strategies dominated the FX market .
Heightened investors concerns about global growth have had a negative effect on commodity currencies .
Finally , in the O/N sessions commodity currencies have caught up with yesterdays rampant commodity price rise .
Canadian data showed that foreigners decreased their holdings of Canadian securities ( bonds and stocks ) in July , - 5.6 b vs. +7.3 b ( first time this year ) .
Prior to Cbanks Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcash injectionÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ the loonie found no love amongst investors as market volatility dissuaded speculators from owning riskier assets .
Global perception has analysts adjusting the looniesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ year end price vs. the greenback to 1.1000 .
Canada has become guilty by its Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœproximity and associationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ with its southern neighbor .
Fears of further financial meltdowns and stagnating global growth could add to the looniesÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ demise in the short term .
The US remains Canada ’s largest export market , over 75 % of our exports head south and 50 % of that is commodity based .
With global growth issues a major concern , commodity prices will continue to drag on the Canadian economy going forward .
Expect traders to be better buyers of US $ on pull backs as Canadian economic data remains on the softer side .
Politically and economically Canada will be pre-occupied with its general election slated for Oct 14th over the next few weeks .
The AUD and NZD found some deserving support on the back of elevated commodity prices yesterday .
But , traders expect the currency to continue to trade under pressure , especially vs. the JPY , as investors are willing to unwind recent carry trades and enter into Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœrisk aversionÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ deals .
The high yielding assets of the Kiwi and AUD $ are considered a pair of the riskiest .
Expect rallies to be sold for now ( 0.8046 ) .
Crude is lower O/N ( $ 96.47 down - 69 c ) .
Oil aggressively advanced yesterday , a day after the Fed stepped in to provide a loan bridge to AIG .
This is an institution that the Fed could not allow to fail .
Investors sought the safety of the commodities on concern that the credit crisis will deepen , leading more financial institutions to fail .
The market still clings to the idea that the ongoing financial turmoil may weaken the global economy and reduce demand even further .
Investors fear that a further deterioration of the US financial system will spread to the real economy and affect demand for oil .
Fundamentally commodity prices have the potential of falling much further .
To date , oil has depreciated 38 % from the highs printed 2 - months ago .
OPEC ( who supply more than 40 % of the world ’s crude ) , have lowered their forecast for 2009 oil demand to 87 m barrels a day because of the global economic slowdown .
Analysts are now predicting that they will Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœstep inÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and take action if price pressure push crude towards $ 80 a barrel .
Market consensus has us believing that OPEC is content with $ 90 - $ 100 a barrel .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s EIA report showed that US crude inventories fell - 6.33 m barrels vs. - 3.5 m to 291.7 m , w/w .
It was the 4th straight inventory decline .
Fuel demand averaged + 19.9 m barrels a day over the past month ( - 4.4 % , y/y ) , while gas consumption averaged + 9.21 m barrels a day ( - 2.6 % , y/ y ) .
Gas stocks declined - 3.31 m barrels to 184.6 m ( the lowest level in nearly 20 - years ) .
With refineries due to come back on line in the Gulf of Mexico , speculators will once again be focusing on demand levels and not inventory .
This may lead to another squeeze lower !
There was no stopping gold priceÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s yesterday .
It advanced the most in 8 - years ( $ 879 ) , as investors sought the safety of the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ on concerns that the credit crisis will deepen , thus leading to more financial institutions failing .
The Nikkei closed at 11,342 down - 407 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,875 up +15 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,795 up +63 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
10 - year Treasury yields eased 6 bp yesterday ( 3.42 % ) and are little changed O/N .
With the loss of confidence in the treasury market spreading , it has managed to push short tem yields ( especially the Bill market ) to their lowest levels in half a century .
Investors are concerned that that credit market losses will widen after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the FedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s takeover of AIG .
With Financial institutions hoarding cash , traders are seeking Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœsafer capitalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and seem to be relinquishing returns and paying for the privilege of knowing their money is safe .
Expect the Fed to increase short term bill issuance ( 40 b 1 - month , similar to cash management ) .
So far this week Cbanks have injected $ 300 b into the financial system to ease credit market concerns .
Money printing presses do not seem to be working fast enough .
Conspiracy theorists do not see the FedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s bridge loan to AIG as a permanent solution , but , a temporary Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœstop gapÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Expect market nervousness to continue to provide an undertone bid for the FI asset class .

How Was The CIA Formed ?
By absorbing the Nazi war criminal infrastructure by Jared Israel
[ Posted 23 December 2003 ] ===========================================================
On Oct 8 , 1998 , the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure
Act became US law .
This legislation : “ ... calls for the establishment of the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group [ IWG ] to locate , identify , and make available to the public Nazi war criminal records . ” [ 1 ]
The IWG ’s task was to organize previously classified documents from the OSS , predecessor of the CIA , as well as from the CIA and other intelligence sources , and to make these documents available to the public .
These were to include documents relating to possible collusion between US government organizations and Nazi war criminals .
Millions of pages have been released but very little information has trickled down to the broad public .
And this trickle has been presented in a way calculated to minimize public awareness of the extent to which the Nazi apparatus was recruited in order - literally - to * become * the US covert operations and intelligence apparatus ( the CIA etc . )
This story centers around the figure of Reinhard Gehlen .
===========================================================
Who was Reinhard Gehlen , and how did US intelligence use him ?
===========================================================
From April 1942 on , Gehlen was head of German Armies East , the Nazi Army ’s intelligence corps in conquered Soviet territory .
Commenting on the release of some previously classified documents concerning Gehlen , the IWG wrote : “ Working immediately after the war with Army Intelligence , the Gehlen Organization became the responsibility of the CIA , which continued the relationship until 1956 .
One document released by the IWG on June 26 , 2000 , shows an early connection between the Strategic Services Unit ( predecessor of the CIA ) and Gehlen ’s group .
The SSU searched for members of Gehlen ’s organization in POW camps and extensively interrogated them .
As the Cold War developed during 1946 , American intelligence officials found themselves lacking recent experience with Soviet intelligence activities and decided to use German experts on the Soviet Union - even though some may have been war criminals . ” [ 2 ]
The above paragraph includes not one false statement ; yet it is completely misleading .
This suggests that the IWG ’s talent may lie in disinformation rather than research .
1 ) The statement that the Gehlen organization was “ working ... with Army Intelligence ” is misleading because “ working with ” implies equality of power : one does not “ work with ” men hiding from the law .
The Nazis recruited by US intelligence were wanted for the worst war crimes ; they were “ employees ” whose alternative was the hangman 's noose .
Surely they did what they were told .
2 ) The use of “ working with ” is also misleading because it suggests that Gehlen ’s Organization ( the ' Org ’ ) was separate from the Strategic Services Unit and later from the CIA .
This is not true .
Gehlen ’s
Org became a decisive , perhaps * the* decisive component of the CIA ’s worldwide apparatus .
Its thousands of highly experienced operatives , much older than incoming CIA recruits , had to have a big effect on the culture of the CIA .
Thus , US intelligence was Nazified .
3 ) The statement that , “ As the Cold War developed during 1946 , American intelligence officials found themselves lacking recent experience with Soviet intelligence activities and decided to use German experts on the Soviet Union - even though some may have been war criminals , ” is false for three reasons .
a)
First , it states that the advent of the so - called Cold War preceded the decision to use Gehlen .
But in fact , the relationship between US intelligence and Gehlen began before World War II ended .
That is , it began considerably before the ‘ outbreak ’ of the Cold War. b)
Second , under the terms of the agreements at the Potsdam Conference , [ 2A ] " 5 .
War criminals and those who have participated in planning or carrying out Nazi enterprises involving or resulting in atrocities or war crimes shall be arrested and brought to judgment .
Nazi leaders , influential Nazi supporters and high officials of Nazi organizations and institutions and any other persons dangerous to the occupation or its objectives shall be arrested and interned . "
As we shall see , Gehlen and his Foreign Armies East organization did participate in " planning or carrying out Nazi enterprises involving or resulting in atrocities or war crimes . "
Moreover , Gehlen brought numerous SS and Gestapo figures into the Gehlen Org , as his part of the US intelligence apparatus was known .
US intelligence officials were required under the terms of the Nuremberg Tribunal to arrest these men .
Given that US intelligence officials would inevitably discover whom he was recruiting , Gehlen would not have dared to involve SS and Gestapo officers without US approval . [ 2B ]
Did USSR intelligence know about the Gehlen Org ?
Of course they knew .
They knew that the US was basing its foreign operations on the extensive apparatus of war criminals responsible for the deaths of millions in the Soviet Union , Eastern Europe and the Balkans .
For the Soviets , this was proof positive that the US meant to overthrow the Soviet regime and replace it with people who had sided with the Nazis during World War II .
Thus the creation of the Gehlen Org constituted the most extreme provocation , helping guarantee the climate of intense hostility which came to be called the ‘ Cold War . ’
This is the exact opposite of the IWG claim that the recruitment of Nazis was a practical ( if regrettable ) * response * to the Cold War. c)
Third , the comment that “ some [ of Gehlen ’s men ] may have been war criminals ” is simply shocking .
The Law under which the IWG was formed is “ The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act . ”
Note the use of the term “ war crimes . ”
As we shall see , one does not need to read the declassified documents to know that Gehlen ’s Org was composed of the worst war criminals .
And I shall show that the US intelligence officials who recruited Gehlen and company had to know with whom they were dealing .
The statement that Gehlen 's men " may have been war criminals " clearly indicates that the IWG is trying to cover up what happened : that the US knowingly reconstructed the Nazi war criminal machine .
4 ) The IWG 's statement that the CIA “ continued the relationship until 1956 ” is a bad joke .
Reading it , one might get the impression that the CIA broke with Gehlen and company in 1956 , but that is not true .
In 1956 the US intelligence group known as Gehlen ’s Org became the BND , the Western German equivalent of the CIA . [ 2C ]
And it was run by Reinhard Gehlen .
" Thus , the US reinstated in Germany the apparatus that had planned and carried out Nazi foreign operations during the World War . "
These men had vast experience of war and racist mass murder and they had the knowledge that the US was sponsoring them .
When the BND , for example , conspired with Croatian fascists in the late 1950s , 60s , 70s , 80s , and 90s , the people doing the conspiring were the same Nazis who had butchered Yugoslavia during World War II .
Let me note , for the record , that this re-creation of the Nazi foreign operations apparatus was an outrageous betrayal of the hundreds of thousands of US and Allied troops who fought and died believing they were ridding the world of the horror of Nazism .
US and then German covert operations - obviously the most critical expression of the foreign policy of any country - were built out of the criminal Nazi apparatus .
This information is staggering .
But what is just a staggering is that * ordinary people have no idea that these damning records have been released . *
I have been reading media coverage of the release of the Gehlen documents and two things are striking : there is very little coverage , and what does exist is a whitewash .
Consider for example an article that appeared in the ' alternative ' newspaper , the San Francisco Bay Guardian , entitled “ The CIA ’s Worst Kept Secret . " [ 3 ]
In this article the author , Martin Lee , portrays the creation of the CIA via the recruitment of thousands of Nazis as a ‘ mistake ’ .
But how could such a mistake be made ?
According to Lee , the US spymasters were fooled by Gehlen and / or did n’t ask too many question because they preferred not to know the answers .
From April 1 , 1942 on , Gehlen was head of the so - called ‘ Foreign Armies East , ’ the infamous intelligence service of the Nazi Army within the Soviet Union .
Martin does state that before the war ended , Gehlen arranged with the U.S. that the Americans would adopt his entire staff .
One of the US officers with whom Gehlen met was General Edwin L. Sibert , chief of military intelligence in the American zone in Germany .
Another was Allen Dulles , a top official at the OSS , predecessor of the CIA .
During the latter half of the war , Dulles ran the OSS station in Berne , Switzerland , conducting espionage operations in Nazi Germany .
In the 1950s he was director of the CIA .
According to Lee , Gehlen fooled Dulles : [ 3 ]
“ Although the Yalta Treaty stipulated that the United States must give the Soviets all captured German officers who had been involved in ‘ eastern area activities , ’ Gehlen was quickly spirited off to Fort Hunt , Va .
The image he projected during 10 months of negotiations at Fort Hunt was , to use a bit of espionage parlance , a ‘ legend ’ - one that hinged on Gehlen ’s false claim that he was never really a Nazi , but was dedicated , above all , to fighting Communism .
Those who bit the bait included future CIA director Allen Dulles , who became Gehlen ’s biggest supporter among American policy wonks . ”
In support of this thesis , Lee quotes Richard Breitman , an historical consultant and the main public voice of the IWG : “ ‘ It was a horrendous mistake , morally , politically , and also in very pragmatic intelligence terms , ’ says American University professor Richard Breitman , chairman of the IWG review panel . ”
But did General Sibert make a “ horrendous mistake ” ?
Was spymaster Allen Dulles fooled ?
Is it possible that American spies who spent the war fighting German intelligence did not know what Gehlen and his Foreign Armies East had done in conquered Russia ?
Does n’t this look like an attempt to minimize the impact of the CIA - Nazi documents ?
This way of writing guarantees that the small amount of information that reaches the public concerning the Nazi origins of the CIA is framed so as to suggest that it was all a blunder .
But how could US officials use Nazi war criminals ' by mistake ' ?
These people were responsible for the worst crimes in the Soviet Union , Eastern Europe , and the Balkans , slaughtering millions of Jews , Serbs , Roma ( ' Gypsies ' ) and others .
How could such well - known monsters be recruited as the building blocks of US foreign operations ' by mistake ' ?
By reconstructing the Nazi apparatus , the US Establishment put a Nazi stamp on US foreign policy , spat in the face of the victims of the Holocaust , guaranteed maximum hostility in the USSR , and had a major impact on domestic US politics as well .
Such a huge effort , with such far - reaching implications , carried out with painstaking attention to detail , cannot have been a blunder .
Mr. Lee writes that : ' A long - hidden trove of once - classified CIA documents confirms one of the worst - kept secrets of the Cold War - the CIA 's use of an extensive Nazi spy network to wage a clandestine campaign against the Soviet Union . ' [ 3 ]
[ My emphasis ]
But Gehlen 's boys were not just spies .
As we shall see , they were the worst war criminals of the century .
===========================================================
An Ideology of Racism ===========================================================
According to Lee , Gehlen fooled US spymaster Allen Dulles into believing he had never been a ‘ sincere ’ Nazi .
But what is a Nazi ?
It is common in the US these days to use ‘ Nazi ’ to describe someone who is mean or repressive .
Sometimes the word is even used to describe a harsh comic figure , as in Seinfeld ’s ‘ Soup Nazi . ’
But the Nazis were not just brutal .
The central feature of Nazism , which attracted supporters from Cairo to New York , was fanatical racism , especially towards Jews .
That racism derived false intellectual justification from the pseudo - science of Eugenics , which originated in Britain and gained prominence in the US in the first half of the century , and was adopted by Hitler ’s Nazis .
Eugenics posits the existence of supposedly inferior , imagined “ races ” .
Coincidentally , these groups coincide with existing objects of bigotry - Black people , Jews , Slavs , American Indians , Mexican Americans , ‘ Gypsies ’ and so on .
According to Eugenics , these groups , and also people with physical or mental disabilities or whose behavior is considered anti-social , must ( according to Eugenics ) be eliminated from the gene pool , one way or another .
In this way , a Master Race is to be created .
Eugenics was financed by pillars of the US Establishment , such as the Rockefeller and Carnegie Institutes and the Ford Foundation .
Eugenics was endorsed by the US State Department and the Supreme Court . [ 4 ]
The Nazis took to eugenics like ducks to water .
During World War II , the Nazis incorporated Eugenics in all their military plans .
The Nazi troops had been indoctrinated with the idea that it was necessary to kill off these " inferior specimens " in order to save first Germany and then humanity .
Starting in April 1942 , Reinhard Gehlen was in charge of the Nazi military intelligence organization in the Soviet Union , Foreign Armies East .
What did the Nazis do in the vast areas they conquered ?
This part of the USSR was populated mainly by Slavs , with a large Jewish minority , and many Roma ( ‘ Gypsies ’ ) .
The Nazi goal was to destroy what they bizarrely called “ Jewish Bolshevism . ”
They aimed to eliminate all Jews and Roma and to reduce the Slavic population by 30 million , enslaving those who survived .
This plan created hell on earth .
According to Prof. Christopher Simpson , a member of the Historical Advisory Panel of the IWG and the author of Blowback , a study of the Nazi-CIA marriage : [ Excerpt from " Blowback " starts here ]
The slaughter that followed the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 is without equal in world history .
Next to the Nazis ’ operation of the anti-Jewish extermination centers at Treblinka , Sobibor , Birkenau , and elsewhere , the most terrible crimes of the entire war took place in the name of anticommunism in the German - occupied territories on the eastern front .
Civilian casualties in these areas were so enormous , so continuous , and so extreme that even counting the dead has proved impossible .
Scholars have attempted to deduce the numbers of fatalities from captured German records , reports of Einsatzgruppen ( mobile execution squads ) , prisoner of war ( POW ) camp mortality reports , and Soviet census statistics .
The evidence indicates that between 3 and 4 million captured Soviet soldiers were intentionally starved to death in German POW camps between 1941 and 1944 .
About 1.3 million Jews were exterminated inside Nazi- occupied Soviet territory , mainly through mass shootings but also through gassing , deportation to extermination camps , looting and destruction of villages , hangings , and torture .
The generally accepted figure for all Soviet war dead is 20 million human beings - about 15 percent of the population of the country at the time - but the destruction was so vast that even this number can be only an educated guess .
The Nazis deliberately used famine as a political weapon in the East , and it soon became the largest single killer .
As the German invasion of the USSR began , General ( later Field Marshal ) Erich von Manstein ordered that “ the Jewish - Bolshevist [ sic ! ] system must be exterminated ....
In hostile cities , a large part of the population will have to starve . ”
Nothing , Manstein continued , “ may , out of a sense of mistaken humaneness , be distributed to prisoners or to the population - unless they are in the service of the German Wehrmacht . ” [ 5 ]
[ Excerpt from " Blowback " ends here ]
Take note of General Manstein ’s words : “ a large part of the population will * have to* starve . ”
He speaks of these people as if they were disease - carrying animals whom public health officials must put to sleep .
Those who object to withholding food from “ the population ” suffer from “ mistaken humaneness ” ...
Thus the entire Wehrmacht , not just the SS or Gestapo , was enlisted in a slaughter which was “ without equal in world history . ”
What about Reinhard Gehlen ?
His intelligence group , Foreign Armies East , was responsible for evaluating information obtained from the interrogation of POWs .
These POWs were mostly Slavs or Jews .
As part of the general plan for so - called ‘ racial purification , ’ Gehlen and his people helped to formulate a sub-plan for POWs which used mass torture and mass murder to extract maximum information , with the result - beneficial to those with a eugenics ideology - that millions of Slavs and Jews were killed in the process : [ Excerpt from " Blowback " starts here ]
Gehlen derived much of his information from his role in one of the most terrible atrocities of the war : the torture , interrogation , and murder by starvation of some 4 million Soviet prisoners of war .
Even Gehlen ’s defenders - and there are many of them , both in Germany and in the United States - acknowledge he was instrumental in organizing the interrogations of these POWs .
The success of this interrogation program from the German military ’s point of view became , in fact , the cornerstone of Gehlen ’s career .
It won him his reputation as an intelligence officer and his major general ’s rank .
[ That is , it was because of these monstrous interrogations that in 1942 Gehlen was put in charge of Foreign Armies East , Nazi military intelligence in the USSR - J.I. ]
But these same interrogations were actually a step in the liquidation of tens of thousands of POWs .
Prisoners who refused to cooperate were often tortured or summarily shot .
Many were executed even after they had given information , while others were simply left to starve to death .
True , Gehlen ’s men did not personally administer the starvation camps , nor are they known to have served in the execution squads .
Such tasks were left to the SS , whose efficiency in such matters is well known .
Instead , Gehlen ’s men were in a sense like scientists who skimmed off the information and documents that rose to the surface of these pestilent camps .
Now and again they selected an interesting specimen : a captured Russian general ready to collaborate , perhaps , or a Ukrainian railroad expert who might supply the locations of vulnerable bridges when given some encouragement to talk .
Gehlen ’s officers were scientists in somewhat the same way that concentration camp doctors were : Both groups extracted their data from the destruction of human beings . [ 6 ]
[ Excerpt from " Blowback " ends here ]
So Gehlen and his organization were involved in the monstrous crimes on the Eastern front in the same way that Eichmann and his men were involved in the death camps : as planners , and also in the same way as people like Dr. Mengele , as gatherers of information .
Moreover , this information was then processed and provided to the Nazi Army in order to help them “ pacify ” the conquered areas .
Thus Gehlen and Co. also aided in carrying out the mass murder of civilians .
To this end , they employed a vast network of spies , corrupt government officials , Nazi sympathizers , Soviet officers and troops who had gone over to the Nazi side , willing thugs , and so on .
Gehlen ’s Foreign Armies
East intelligence apparatus was organizationally distinct from the SS and the Gestapo , who actually carried out the organized killing .
During official US interrogations , with stenographers present , Gehlen stated that he would never use SS or Gestapo men .
The SS and Gestapo had been declared criminal organizations at the Nuremberg Tribunal and the US officials who employed Gehlen were required to arrest anyone whom they knew had been a member of either organization .
So in order to protect his hosts , Gehlen had to say , on record , that he would never employ men who had been in the SS . [ 2B ]
But despite Gehlen ’s supposedly ‘ plausible denial , ’ in fact the Org was full of SS killers .
[ Excerpt from " Blowback " starts here ]
At least a half dozen of his first staff of 50 officers were former SS or SD men including SS Obersturmfuehrer Hans Sommer , who had set seven Paris synagogues to the torch in October 1941 , SS Standartenfuehrer Willi Krichdaum , Senior Gestapo leader in Southeastern Europe and SS Sturmbannfuhrer Fritz Schmidt , Gestapo Chief in Kiel Germany , each of whom was given responsible positions in the new Gehlen organization . [ 7 ]
[ Excerpt from " Blowback " ends here ]
Gehlen ’s Foreign Armies East had only dealt with the occupied USSR .
By recruiting members of the SS and Gestapo , Gehlen and his US backers extended the Org ’s reach directly to Eastern and Southeastern Europe .
For example , Willi Krichdaum , mentioned above , was the senior Gestapo official in Southeastern Europe .
That includes Yugoslavia , where the Nazis committed some of their worst crimes .
Men like Krichdaum would know the names of members of Waffen SS divisions from their areas .
The Waffen SS was recruited from Volksdeutsche ( people of German descent living outside Germany ) and non-German Nazi volunteers from all over Europe .
The more extensive Gehlen ’s
Org became , the more ties it had to these Nazis - these Waffen SS volunteers who had quietly returned to their countries of origin ( the UK , the Netherlands , Norway , Sweden , Yugoslavia , Italy and so on ) .
Thus Gehlen ’s Org gave US intelligence a readymade political apparatus all over Europe .
Once Gehlen and the US representatives worked out the details for Americanizing his Nazis , the next step was to reconstitute the whole structure , including middle leaders and the rank and file .
For that purpose , Gehlen ’s Org screened displaced persons arriving in Germany .
Gehlen chose Franz Six to oversee the screening : [ Excerpt from " Blowback " starts here ]
Gehlen ’s man in émigré enterprises , SS Brigadefuhrer Franz Six , is a major war criminal and is still alive at last report .
He was once described by Adolf Eichmann as a Streber ( a ‘ real eager beaver ’ ) on the so - called Jewish Question and as a favored protégé of SS chief Himmler ’s .
Eichmann should have known :
His own first efforts in the Holocaust were carried out under Six ’s personal command in the “ Ideological Combat ” section of the security service .
In 1941 Six led the Vorkommando Moskau , an advance squad of the Nazi invasion , whose job it was to seize Communist party and NKVD archives in order to compile lists of hunted Soviet officials and to liquidate those who were caught .
Six ’s Vorkommando never made it to Moscow , but his own reports indicate that his unit murdered approximately 200 people in cold blood in Smolensk , where they had stopped on the march to the Russian capital .
The Smolensk victims , Six wrote headquarters , included “ 46 persons , among them 38 intellectual Jews who had tried to create unrest and discontent in the newly established Ghetto of Smolensk . [ 8 ]
[ Excerpt from " Blowback " ends here ]
Franz Six and his underlings knew what they were looking for : [ Excerpt from " Blowback " starts here ]
Although it is true that the majority of the postwar refugees in Germany were not Nazi collaborators and had not committed war crimes , it is also true that the minority who had done such things were exactly the ones who were sought out by the Org as Gehlen ’s [ CIA ] group came to be known . [ 9 ]
[ Excerpt from " Blowback " ends here ]
These people were the all - important link between Gehlen ’s people and the local Nazi apparatus on the ground in Russia and Eastern and Southeastern Europe .
With their recruitment , a huge part of Hitler ’s foreign operations apparatus had been recreated .
===========================================================
Did the Americans know ?
===========================================================
As noted , one of the men who spoke to Gehlen was General Sibert , head of military intelligence in the US occupation zone in Germany .
As Christopher Simpson notes : “ It is after all the job of any professional intelligence officer to learn everything there is to know about the groups on his payroll that might reveal their loyalty .
General Siebert who by then had become the leading American sponsor of the Gehlen organization had not gotten to be chief of US Army intelligence in Germany by being naïve . ” [ 10 ]
And Sibert was not the only top US intelligence man involved .
There was Allen Dulles , the famously cunning station chief of US intelligence in Berne , Switzerland .
His * job * was to work with intelligence sources in Germany .
Gehlen was n’t a minor figure .
He was the head of German intelligence in the main theater of operations - the Soviet Union .
One did n’t have to be in intelligence to know that the Germans were committing monstrous war crimes in Russia - this was shown on newsreels in every theater in America .
And of course Dulles , a shrewd intelligence chief , would be aware that Gehlen ’s organization took part in planning and providing intelligence for these war crimes .
The group set up to plan Gehlen 's Org : “ ... included Richard Helms , for example , who was later to become CIA Deputy Director for Clandestine Operations and eventually Agency [ that is , CIA ] director under Presidents Johnson and Nixon , William Casey , CIA director under President Reagan ... ” [ 11 ]
It is simply absurd to believe that men like Sibert , Dulles , Helms and Casey were fooled .
And in any case , what did it matter whether Gehlen was a ‘ sincere ’ Nazi or not ?
He was reconstituting the Nazi apparatus , and the US was using that apparatus as the crucial European section of its intelligence operation .
And that , quite obviously , was no mistake .
===========================================================
In conclusion , a word about Dr. Breitman ===========================================================
Earlier I wrote that Richard Breitman has been the main public voice of the IWG , " the Interagency Working Group to locate , identify , and make available to the public Nazi war criminal records . " ( see above ) .
On the IWG Website , Breitman is listed as one of five " IWG Historical Consultants " .
http://www.archives.gov/iwg/iwg_roster/historical_consultants.html
But he is not one of five .
He is the IWG person most consistently quoted by the mass media and it is his reports and comments that dominate the IWG presence on the Internet .
These comments consistently serve to muddy the waters , negating the very facts he is reporting !
An example of this is Breitman ’s report , published on the IWG Website , concerning the relationship between US counter - intelligence officers and Hermann Julius Hoefle .
Here is the first paragraph of Breitman ’s report : [ 12 ]
" Hermann Julius Hoefle , a major Nazi war criminal who went unpunished after 1945 , served briefly in 1954 as a paid informant for the U. S. Army Counter - Intelligence Corps .
According to a newly declassified Army Investigative Repository Records ( IRR ) file on Hoefle , the CIC was aware of Hoefle 's SS background but failed to discover what Hoefle had really done during World War II . "
The key phrase is " failed to discover " , which implies that the intelligence officers avoided digging into Hoefle ’s past lest they discover something they did n’t want to know .
Breitman is suggesting that , by not knowing Hoefle was a war criminal , the CIC people rationalize employing him for intelligence purposes .
Since the above - quoted excerpt is the first paragraph of a 1000 word report , it is the part that people are most likely to read .
It tells them how to view the rest of the text .
A bit later in the report , Breitman reinforces this view , that the American officers sinned by avoiding knowledge , when he states that : “ A CIC assessment of Hoefle 's character in February 1954 did not penetrate beyond the surface : ‘ Subject is punctual , militant in action , truthful and trusting in a person only after his trustworthiness has been proven .
Subject has been found to be most appreciative and courteous … . ’ ”
Notice the phrase , “ did not penetrate beyond the surface . ”
Again , the impression is created that the CIC did not want to know too much .
It is only after the first half of the report - constructed so as to give
us a phony sins - of - omission interpretation - that Breitman provides the
information that flatly contradicts such an ' interpretation ' : " Hoefle had told CIC officials that during the war he had served in the Waffen - SS , that he was affiliated with the organization of partisan groups in fighting the Russians , and that he had taken part in security work in Poland in regard to German personnel .
‘ Security work ’ involved the murder of some two million Polish Jews .
Anyone with some knowledge about Nazi Germany and with access to his SS file in the Berlin Document Center could have exposed these falsehoods and evasions . ”
Were the CIC officers * not* people with some knowledge about Nazi Germany ?
Did they not know that “ security work ” in Poland involved the murder of two million Jews ?
Did they not know that the partisans whom Hoefle helped organize were involved in mass murder in Russia ?
Of course they knew .
After all , these US officers had n’t just wandered in off the street !
They were intelligence experts with the job of interrogating Nazis !
Moreover , a bit later Breitman mentions that : “ … the CIC was aware that Poland wanted to prosecute him for war crimes ”
So : CIC knew “ security work ” in Poland involved the killing of two million Jews ; they knew Hoefle was involved in security work ; they knew what Hoefle 's so - called partisans did in Russia and they knew that Hoefle was wanted for war crimes in Poland .
Given what the CIC * did * know , their description of Hoefle : “ Subject is punctual , militant in action , truthful and trusting in a person only after his trustworthiness has been proven .
Subject has been found to be most appreciative and courteous … ” - is not , as Breitman suggests , noteworthy for its superficiality ; rather , it suggests a friendly relationship with a man whom the CIC officers knew perfectly well was a racist mass murderer .
In one of the excerpts quoted earlier , Breitman false - criticized the CIC because , “ Anyone … with access to his SS file in the Berlin Document Center could have exposed these falsehoods and evasions . ”
I call this false criticism because it clearly implies that the CIC erred by * failing * to consult Hoefle ’s file at the Berlin Document Center when , as we have seen , they did not * need * to consult Hoefle ’s file .
This is already damning evidence that Breitman is trying to cover - up - but in fact , it is worse , for near the end of the Hoefle report , Breitman mentions that : “ … there apparently was a cursory check of Berlin Document Center records about him … ”
So the CIC * did* consult the Berlin Document Center file !
It took a lot of hard work for Breitman to produce a report whose conclusion , that the CIC acted in willful ignorance , so obviously contradicts the very facts he presents .
These facts prove that the CIC knew exactly who Hoefle was !
The IWG membership includes , on the one hand , five people representing the intelligence community and the State Department .
On the other hand , it includes Elizabeth Holtzman , who has crusaded for the exposure of Nazi war criminals , and Eli Rosenbaum , the legendary Director of the Office of Special Investigations at the Department of Justice , who has led the prosecution of Nazis for illegal entry to the US .
The presence of Holtzman and Rosenbaum suggests that part of the IWG sincerely wants to get out the whole truth .
However , the fact that Breitman , who tries to hide the truth , is the effective spokesperson for the IWG suggests that the forces of cover - up are in control .
Indeed , the IWG 's attempt to hide the truth , so obvious in Breitman ’s writing , tells us that not only did the US foreign policy Establishment recreate the Nazi ’s race - driven foreign operations machine and put it back in power in Germany , but the powers - that - be remain loyal to these monstrous policies to this day .

During their showdown last winter , Michigan 's native son lambasted McCain for truthfully informing autoworkers their jobs are n't " coming back . "
The former Massachusetts governor pledged to fight for every job , promising primary voters , " If I am president of the United States , I will not rest until Michigan is back . "
In speeches across the state , Romney also blamed Washington for Detroit 's woes .
" Look at Washington .
What have they done to help the domestic auto industry ?
Look , you can't keep on throwing anvils at Michigan and the auto industry and then say , ' How come they are not swimming well ? ' " he declared .
McCain recovered from the Michigan loss and went on to win his party 's nomination .
But , now that McCain lost to Democrat Barack Obama , Romney and others are already jockeying for position in the 2012 GOP presidential contest .
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is trying to capitalize on her celebrity as McCain 's running mate .
But first , she must overcome political damage from two sources : her own campaign performance ; and anonymous quotes calling her a " whack job " and " diva . "
Romney loyalists denied reports they were behind the most unflattering Palin assessments .
Meanwhile , Romney has problems and rivals of his own .
In his new book , " Do The Right Thing , " Mike Huckabee , who also ran for the Republican nomination in 2008 , rips Romney as a flip - flopper who switched positions on abortion , gay rights , gun control , and campaign finance reform .
The former Arkansas governor also writes that Romney 's record was " anything but conservative until he changed all the light bulbs in his chandelier in time to run for president . "
Indeed , Romney was never able to grasp the differences between corporate and political turnarounds .
In the private sector , dramatic retooling is key to survival .
As a businessman , Romney understood how to do that .
His turnaround of the Salt Lake City Olympics is often cited as an example .
In the public sector , seismic shifts in position create suspicion and undercut credibility .
As a politician , Romney continues to lose his .
If politicians never change their thinking , they risk turning into George W. Bush .
Stubbornness will forever define his presidency .
But if the changes of heart are too extreme and obviously calculated , they end up looking like Romney .
As a candidate , he had no discernible political core .
Over the course of the presidential campaign , McCain lost much of his own core , too .
Both Romney and McCain sold their souls to the political right .
However , in Romney 's case , his positioning on social issues began to feel less important against the backdrop of the current economic crisis .
As the economic news worsened during the final weeks of the presidential campaign , Romney 's expertise on fiscal matters was held out as a reason why he would have been the better choice for the Republican ticket .
Romney 's op - ed column reaffirms McCain 's decision to look elsewhere for a running mate .
McCain knew Romney would always be a rival , never a teammate .
His ambition is too naked .
His finger is always in the air , not just testing the political winds but succumbing to them at first gust .
This is a presidential candidate who cast himself as the auto workers ' champion .
" I hear people say , ' It 's gone , those jobs are gone , transportation 's gone , it 's not coming back . '
I 'm going to fight for every single job .
I 'm going to rebuild the industry .
I 'm going to take burdens off the back of the auto industry , " Romney said in January .
Back then , he never mentioned bankruptcy as the way to do it .
Never underestimate Romney 's willingness to shamelessly reverse direction , to get where he wants to go .

Nunavut 's newly elected politicians will select the territory 's premier , speaker , and most of its cabinet ministers in a leadership forum scheduled for Nov. 14 .
Members of the territory 's third legislative assembly announced the forum date Friday afternoon .
Eighteen of Nunavut 's 19 MLAs , most of whom were elected in the Oct. 27 general election , were in Iqaluit this week for an orientation session at the legislature .
One MLA , Fred Schell of South Baffin , was elected in a byelection held Nov. 3 .
In a news release , MLAs said they decided to leave one of the seven ministerial spots unfilled until early next year , so that the MLA for Akulliq could take part in the race for that seat .
The Akulliq MLA will be elected in a byelection scheduled for Dec. 15 .
The leadership forum will begin at 10 a.m. ET at the legislature .
The event is open to the public , and will also be broadcast live across the territory on local community cable channels .
Under Nunavut 's consensus model of government , MLAs select the premier and cabinet members among their own ranks at the leadership forum , usually held two to three weeks after the election .
Selection of the premier and cabinet will be made by secret ballot .
Ten Years of  Death with Dignity 
Courtney S. Campbell
The Oregon Death with Dignity Act ( ODDA ) , which permits physicians to write a prescription for lethal drugs to qualified terminally ill patients , has been in effect for a little over a decade .
It has , from October 1997 to the present , been the only such statute in the United States permitting what is variously called “ physician - assisted suicide , ” “ physician aid in dying , ” or “ death with dignity ” ( the statute refers to the procedure as the ending of life in a “ humane and dignified manner ” ) .
However , in the November 2008 election , citizens in the state of Washington will have an opportunity to vote on ballot initiative I -1000 , a measure that is essentially the same as the Oregon statute .
The advocacy group promoting I -1000 has drawn on features of the Oregon experience to indicate that the Oregon law is “ very safe and effective ” and that “ aid in dying is working . ”
To weigh the claims made by supporters and opponents of the proposed Washington state initiative , we ought to carefully examine the first decade of Oregon ’s experience with physician - assisted suicide .
The Rationale for “ Death with Dignity ”
The central stated purpose of the ODDA — to expand patient control over end - of - life choices — has become its enduring ethical and cultural legacy .
In Cruzan v. Director , Missouri Department of Health ( 1990 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court asserted the legality of patient refusals of virtually every form of medical treatment , and in 1993 , the Oregon legislature passed the Oregon Health Care Reform Act , which some fifteen years later remains a very expansive advance directives law .
Still , even if it was not professionally , ethically , or culturally barred , it remained illegal to hasten death intentionally through the prescription of lethal drugs .
The ODDA aimed to end this ban on the grounds of patient self - determination and “ choice . ”
The act ’s advocates saw the conferral of a right to choose the manner and timing of one ’s death as a logical extension of the expansive rights terminally ill patients possessed to refuse treatment .
That is , they saw no principled difference between , on the one hand , refusing medical treatment in a way that would inevitably bring about death and , on the other , hastening death with a lethal drug .
Once the outcome of death for a patient had already been accepted as a medically legitimate precedent in the context of patient refusals of treatment , then the question of the means to death should be settled not by the state , by medical professionals , or by religious institutions , but by the terminally ill patient .
While the principle of patient self - determination was a primary public justification for the Oregon Death with Dignity Act , the legislation ’s advocates also appealed to a perception , supported by numerous publicized cases , of a painful dying experience for many terminally ill patients .
That is , although the enacting statute itself frames the rationale for the act in terms of patient choice and autonomy ( as is the case with Washington I - 1000 ) , a complementary argument — one with considerable public sway — was framed in terms of physician compassion and beneficence .
This argument is somewhat at odds with the reality of patient experience .
According to data compiled by the Oregon Department of Human Services from 1998 to 2007 , the 341 patients who died under the provisions of the ODDA during that period cited a “ loss of autonomy ” more frequently than anything else as a concern contributing to their decision ; 89 percent mentioned autonomy while only about 27 percent mentioned “ inadequate pain control ” ( ranking it sixth among patient concerns ) .
But in the public mind , the prospect of a painful dying experience looms large ; it evokes a powerful visceral response from voters and caregivers .
A second argument for the Oregon Death with Dignity Act focused on the roles of participating physicians , seeking to provide physicians and other health care providers with immunity from prosecution .
At stake in this rationale was professional autonomy — that is , the freedom of physicians to practice medicine according to their own standards of best practice in the care of the terminally ill — but also a shifting conception of professional integrity .
The longstanding professional objection to physician participation in euthanasia and to physician assistance in hastening death had been associated with an understanding that physician integrity entailed a commitment to healing and a prohibition of medical killing .
However , supporters of the ODDA argued that the integrity of the medical profession was not entirely subsumed by a commitment to healing but should , at the very least , be complemented by a contractual model of physician respect for the choices of autonomous patients .
Once professional integrity is not understood as commitment to an abstract ideal , such as healing , but to collaboration with patient self - determination , then the prospect of professional conflict is diminished .
The act ’s proponents also pointed to reports of extensive physician participation in hastening death outside the purview of the law .
Thus , they argued , a “ death with dignity ” law would give de jure sanction to what was , in many instances , de facto practice , and would acknowledge the changed conceptual and ethical parameters of the physician - patient relationship .
However , this rationale remains contested a decade after the ODDA became law .
For example , the Bush administration led an effort to overturn the act , initially spearheaded by Attorney General John Ashcroft , and then by his successor , Alberto Gonzales ; it leaned on the argument that physicians who prescribed substances regulated under the federal Controlled Substances
Act , for the purpose of hastening the death of terminally ill patients , were not engaged in medically legitimate actions and should be sanctionable at some level ( licensure , prosecution , etc. ) .
This was not resolved in the legal system until January 2006 , when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6 - 3 in Gonzales v. Oregon that federal authority over the regulation of controlled substances did not give the government the power to determine the medically legitimate purposes of drugs that were not otherwise prohibited .
A third justification for the ODDA was a call for processes to ensure democratic responsibility and public accountability .
The advocates of the act sought to provide a regulatory framework and a measure of public transparency for the kinds of hastened - death procedures they were convinced were already occurring in secret — without opening the door to the sort of spectacles and publicized abuses carried out by Dr. Jack Kevorkian in Michigan .
The procedural criteria delineated in the act — including diagnosis of terminal illness by two qualified physicians , patient decision - making capacity , an informed decision process , reiterated ( and revocable ) requests , mandatory waiting periods , and permitting physician provision of a prescription but stopping short of physician - administered euthanasia — were designed to assure the public that physician - assisted death could be regulated in a manner that would deter abuses and provide oversight of the responsible actions of individual practitioners and patients .
The ODDA was structured around the three pillars of patient self - determination , professional immunity and integrity , and public accountability , considered individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for legalizing physician - assisted suicide .
Each of these conditions has been the subject of moral , religious , professional , and political critique that reached a crescendo in Gonzales v. Oregon and has since abated ( although it has been revived by Washington ’s I - 1000 debate ) .
For example , the annual report of the Oregon Department of Human Services on the statistical frequency and demographic profile of patients was a national news story from 1999 through 2001 , receiving widespread coverage through publication in the New England Journal of Medicine .
However , by 2007 , the annual report was no longer front - page news nationally or even locally ; coverage of the report was relegated to the “ Metro ” ( B ) section of the state ’s leading newspaper , The Oregonian .
Unexpected Results
After a decade of physician - assisted suicide in Oregon , what results do we have from this unique experiment carried out in what Justice Brandeis famously called the “ laboratory ” of the states ?
Among the lessons that this past decade holds — lessons that might illuminate the decisions faced by Washington voters — are several surprises .
Death with dignity is the death of choice for relatively few persons .
Before the act was implemented , opponents anticipated a demographic migration of near - terminal patients to Oregon , such that Oregon would become a “ suicide center ” for the terminally ill , with all sorts of ensuing social catastrophes .
The empirical evidence does not bear out these projections .
In ten years , 541 Oregon residents have received lethal prescriptions to end their lives ; of this number , 341 patients actually ingested the drugs .
These figures are not only lower than the substantial numbers predicted by opponents , they are even smaller than the more conservative estimates anticipated by advocates .
While those figures have generally risen each year , the deaths under the ODDA still comprise a very low proportion of Oregon ’s total deaths .
Given the predictions of both the ODDA ’s original supporters and opponents , one might be inclined to ask not why are some terminally ill patients seeking recourse to physician - assisted suicide , but rather why are n’t more of them doing so ?
In some years , and in some cases , the prospect of federal intervention may have had a kind of “ chilling ” effect — if not necessarily among patients requesting such assistance , then on willing physician participants .
There may also be a general demographic factor at work : younger persons may be more willing to support physician - assisted suicide than elderly persons who may be staring their own mortality , or that of loved ones , in the face .
However , a likelier explanation may be that the ODDA served as a catalyst to improved end - of - life care among Oregon practitioners — including the increased use of hospice and palliative care , and the easing of restrictions on the drugs practitioners could provide to relieve pain .
This is a very significant possibility , because it implies that ensuring a dignified death may not be a matter of changing the laws so much as a matter of changing medical practices and professional education .
Moreover , it suggests that , for most people , a pharmacologically - induced death is not a precondition of a dignified death , nor that the possession of a right entails its subsequent use .
Other states have not followed the Oregon model .
In the months following its passage in November 1994 , the ODDA was heralded as a national model for other states in addressing issues presented by terminally ill patients , particularly as it went beyond the traditional moral and legal boundary of treatment refusal but stopped short of an even more controversial practice , physician - administered euthanasia .
Yet , despite numerous efforts — including in state legislatures and by citizen initiatives —
Oregon has been more the national maverick than the national model .
Although the I -1000 initiative is likely to be approved in Washington , the interesting question is why other states have not followed the path that Oregon thought itself to be pioneering .
For one reason or another , an act like Oregon ’s may not be necessary or feasible for many states .
First , although suicide has been decriminalized and euthanasia remains a form of homicide in all states , the legal situation is not so clear - cut when it comes to statutes on physician assistance in suicide .
Some states do not have specific laws prohibiting physician - assisted suicide ; among states that do have such laws , violations may not be reported , the laws may not be enforced , or the participating provider may not be convicted or sentenced .
That is to say , substantial discretion and flexibility on these questions are already embedded in the laws of many states .
If we understand law to be not simply a social mechanism for restraining wrongdoing but also an educator of social values , it may be that the mere possibility of passing such an act serves as sufficient impetus to find alternatives for improving care at the end of life .
Patients seem relatively free of or immune from coercive influences .
In the run-up to its passage , a significant objection to the ODDA was that even though its advocates were using the rhetoric of patient choice and self - determination , patient choices would ultimately reflect compromised voluntariness or even coercion .
Put another way , though the act sought to legalize one method for exercising a “ right to die , ” critics were concerned that patients could subjectively experience this as a “ duty to die ” for the benefit of family or others .
This perception was reinforced by various studies of physicians ’ attitudes towards patient choices .
For example , a 1996 study ( conducted while the act was being legally contested and published in the New England Journal of Medicine ) reported that more than 93 percent of 2,761 polled Oregon physicians believed a patient might request lethal drugs “ because of concern about being a burden , ” and more than 83 percent believed a patient may make such a request “ because of financial pressure . ”
If these were the motivating factors in patient decisions , contrary to the stated rationale of expanding patient choice and rights , the ODDA could be seen as limiting choice or coercing decisions .
In practice , according to the ODDA data collected by the Oregon government , becoming a “ burden ” to family and other caregivers emerged as an end - of - life concern for 39 percent of the 341 patients who have used the act in its first decade — a not insignificant number , but still much lower than the percentage of patients who expressed direct self - regarding concerns about loss of autonomy , diminished quality of life , loss of dignity , and loss of control of bodily functions .
Less than 3 percent expressed concerns about the financial implications of treatment .
A caveat is necessary here :
The demographic information collected by the Oregon Department of Human Services involves reports only from physicians about patient concerns — so the information is second - hand and may not penetrate to the depth of patient motivations that a first - hand qualitative interview might .
Moreover , the information compiled from physician reports is generated by a government - issued standardized form that asks the physician to mark any of seven boxes that best reflect the reporting physician ’s view of the concerns contributing to the patient ’s request for a lethal drug — forcing physicians to use generic categories that may imperfectly , if at all , express their patients ’ subjective experiences and motivations .
Because of these limitations in the state - sanctioned reporting method , other studies have attempted to more accurately identify the reasons for patient choices .
For example , a 2003 study published in the Journal of Palliative Medicine fastened more on patient concerns over “ control of the dying process ” that had been relayed to physicians , a concept that is intimated but not specifically described in the seven categories on the state reporting form .
It is also unfortunate that no empirical research has been conducted on the reasons why most eligible terminally ill patients have said “ no , ” either explicitly or implicitly by their actions , when it comes to exercising their right to request a lethal prescription .
These considerations notwithstanding , the procedures embedded in the statute for ensuring informed and voluntary decisions by terminally ill patients have been substantially effective .
The pre-implementation concerns of critics about coerced or compromised choices do not seem borne out in practice .
“ Death with dignity ” has been largely normalized in medical practice and moral discourse .
The passage of the ODDA in 1994 and its decade of implementation without the dire consequences envisioned by opponents has altered the tenor of discourse about ethical options at the end of life .
The question is no longer whether physician - assisted suicide should be permitted within medicine , but how to regulate and monitor the approved processes effectively .
Instead of grappling with the fundamental moral questions , commentary about the act now often sticks to the far more mundane questions of oversight and administration .
Physician - assisted suicide , no longer novel , does n’t possess the sharp edge it once had in public , professional , and bioethical debate ; it has largely been supplanted by more hot - button issues , such as research on embryonic stem cells or new genetic breakthroughs .
While college students are not the truest gauge of the cultural Zeitgeist , it has been remarkable to me to observe the shift in student attitudes at my state university from 1994 to the present .
Prior to its passage , students in biomedical ethics courses considered the ODDA a “ burning issue , ” a “ hot topic , ” one that made for a good debate , and a subject for which there were commonly significant differences in opinion .
And student engagement with the issue , as evidenced by the number of related term papers , ran broad and deep .
By contrast , today ’s students , ten years after the ODDA ’s implementation , have been acculturated to a “ right to death with dignity ” as just “ the way things are . ”
They find it difficult to see the issue as morally or professionally relevant , and they commonly wonder what “ the problem ” is with the other forty - nine states , and why , after more than ten years , Oregon is still the only state with such a law .
Student engagement through submitted term papers has declined from nearly 30 percent of students to approximately 3 percent .
In my most recent class , not a single student raised an objection to Washington I -1000 .
Pain Control , Complications , and Confusion
Some implications of the ODDA ’s implementation were easier to foresee , including the general improvement of pain control , the overall lack of medical complications resulting from the lethal drug , and an ongoing confusion about how the act works in practice .
Palliative care and pain control emerged as a paramount focus of end - of - life care .
As described above , the supporters of the ODDA in the 1990s often invoked “ hard cases ” — nightmarish scenarios of terminally ill patients tortured by unrelenting pain .
This rhetoric was intended to evoke public sympathies towards the plight of persons whose condition made them very vulnerable , as well as dismay — if not outrage — at the apparent indifference in the medical system , religious communities , and the law towards such patients .
The implication was that these patients were destined to live out their final days either tethered to technological life support ( and perhaps unconscious ) or in substantial pain , unless the ODDA became law and professional compassion joined with respect to enable a hastened death .
In fact , the passage of the ODDA led to a greater effort on the part of physicians and palliative and hospice care teams to ensure adequate pain control .
A Task Force to Improve the Care of Terminally - Ill Oregonians was established to bring greater awareness to the question of pain management immediately following implementation .
The task force issued an influential report in 1998 that practitioners still rely on a decade later .
Institutions involved in pain management developed new protocols , and laws that had raised the prospect of licensure investigations of physicians who provided more pain medication than called for in conventional medical protocols were rescinded .
Thus , physicians no longer faced a professional and legal deterrent against the use of personalized pain control methods .
As noted above , the lower - than - expected number of patients requesting lethal drugs can likely be attributed in part to these improvements in the quality of pain management .
And even the patients who requested and used lethal prescriptions — recall , 27 percent of those 341 patients said they were worried about inadequate pain control — may not have been experiencing pain in their terminal phase but rather anticipating and hoping to avoid a painful death .
The lethal drugs are largely without additional medical complications .
A central argument of opponents of the ODDA was that through the prescribed drugs , physicians would be exposing their patients to substantial risks of harm , including severe complications , lingering deaths , and unintentionally induced comas .
This claim was emphasized because there was ( understandably ) no reliable body of medical evidence on what drugs and dose ranges would bring about a patient ’s death without complications .
Thus , it was argued , rather than benefiting the patient by providing the means to a hastened death , the patients would risk continued life in a “ worse - than - death ” condition — in which case the prospect of euthanasia , which was a violation of the statute , would be necessary to end life .
This fear seemed overstated at the time , drawing as it did on disputed anecdotal accounts from the Dutch experience with physician - assisted suicide and physician - administered euthanasia .
Indeed , the implementation of the ODDA indicates that those concerns were unfounded .
According to the physician reporting system , almost 95 percent of patients have experienced no complications ; just over 5 percent of patients have initially regurgitated the lethal dose .
There have been no interventions by emergency medical services , and the time frame between ingestion of the prescription and death has ranged from as short as one minute to as long as three and a half days , with the median being 25 minutes .
It would be useful to know the minimal and maximal time frames beyond which a patient can be said to have experienced “ complications , ” because disclosure of such information is necessary to any authentic process of informed consent — but unfortunately the state reporting system does not assess this .
In this regard , it is also important to ask who would determine if complications of one sort or another had been experienced by the patient .
In only 28 percent of the patient deaths has the prescribing physician been present at the time of patient ingestion of the lethal dose , and in 19 percent of the cases , no health care provider has been in attendance .
In the remaining 53 percent of patient deaths , some provider besides the prescribing physician has been present at the time of ingestion .
The case for physician - assisted suicide as a safe and effective procedure with minimal complications would be strengthened if the prescribing physician , or at least the reporting physician , was present at both the time of ingestion and the time when death was declared .
If the median time frame from ingestion to death is 25 minutes , it seems not too much to ask a professional to be present with the patient .
Even if there are no complications , it would still be a profound gesture of presence and commitment to remain with the patient to the very end .
And in circumstances where the actual time frame is not 25 minutes , but pushing 25 hours , or even 83 hours , continued monitoring by the professional would seem to be a necessary element of care .
Citizens can be confused about their rights and options regarding end - of - life choices .
Despite all the legal and educational efforts seeking to inform Oregon residents of their rights and options pertaining to end - of - life choices , there remains a good deal of confusion , at least as expressed in public gatherings and discussion forums .
The state has two forms of advance directives , which can be used independently or in conjunction with each other , and which are comprehensive with respect to termination of medical treatment or appointment of a proxy .
However , these advance directives are separate from the ODDA application process : terminally ill persons seeking lethal drugs must use an additional request form specific to the provisions of the act .
An advance directive that includes a request for physician assistance in dying is unlikely to be honored .
This is a point on which there seems to be significant confusion .
Although there seems to be broad public consensus that certain kinds of death can be degrading and demeaning to dignity , and most people seem to want to avoid a persistent vegetative condition or a Terri Schiavo - like death , it is not clear in the minds of many citizens that the advance directive process that would apply in those circumstances is separate from the physician - assisted suicide process .
There remains a compelling need for public education .
The Experiment ’s Unanswered Questions
When the Oregon Death with Dignity Act first passed , it was heralded by some commentators as a “ bold experiment . ”
The first decade of that experiment ’s results are in : it seems that the practice of prescribing lethal drugs to terminally ill patients is effective and generally without further medical complications .
Consequentialist objections to the act have largely been refuted by experience .
Insofar as objections continue to be voiced by various advocacy groups or medical practitioners , they tend to rely on non-consequentialist appeals to the intrinsic value or sanctity of human life , or to the moral vocation of health care professionals .
Similar consequentialist arguments have been articulated against Washington I -1000 — but if experience is any guide , they can not be long sustained .
Moreover , since public policy ( including health care policy ) primarily depend upon utilitarian assumptions , it will be very difficult for non-consequentialist principles to gain much footing in debates over legalization .
That said , as a matter of public policy , physician - assisted suicide measures are always open to evaluation based on continuing experience .
There are three broad ongoing questions about the Oregon experience that are relevant to the current debate in Washington over I -1000 and that will be relevant to future discussions in other states .
First , what is the nature of the patient experience ?
Advocates for the ODDA and its imitators in other states have based their arguments on the principle of patient self - determination , but even after a decade we know relatively little about the determining self of the patients who request lethal drugs ; their reasoning processes and worldviews are largely opaque .
This lack of transparency is partly attributable to necessary protections for confidentiality and privacy ( both for patients and providers ) , but it is exacerbated by a state reporting system that filters patient experiences through physician perceptions and voices .
The voice of patient experience is further attenuated by the state - imposed template that limits the responses physicians can offer .
To be sure , the reporting categories help to efficiently quantify results , but they are qualitatively inadequate .
The literature on death and dying since the days of Elisabeth Kübler - Ross has revealed an emotional and cognitive experience of dying patients that centers on a fear of abandonment , or an increasing sense of isolation , or a process in which a kind of social death precedes the biological death .
However , there is no place on the state report for physicians to even mark a box that alienation , estrangement , or isolation may have been motivations contributing to a patient request — let alone room to go into any depth on the patient ’s mindset .
A disturbing October 2008 study in the British Medical Journal indicated that 16 percent of patients who requested a lethal prescription under the ODDA from 2004 to 2006 suffered from clinical depression but were not referred for counseling as the law requires .
For a statute that is promoted explicitly through the rhetoric of patient self - determination and choice , such findings present a substantial concern that the ODDA may not provide sufficient protection for some vulnerable patients .
This study , coupled with the generally opaque patient experience , raises the possibility that physician - assisted suicide is a quick fix for the wrong problem .
If the patient requests a lethal prescription because of fears of abandonment or isolation or depression as he or she dies , or even certain metaphysical or spiritual concerns , then it is the social , psychological , relational , or philosophical context that needs to be attended to , and not only the patient request .
As things currently stand , however , the nature of the patient experience is badly diluted and filtered , and the dead tell no tales .
Second , what constitutes a “ dignified death ” ?
It is very difficult to know what ethical significance , if any , to attribute to an act that contains the value - laden term “ dignity ” as part of its title and public legacy .
The meaning of the term was left completely unexamined in the political context of the act ’s passage and in the subsequent political discussion , revealing an impoverishment in moral discourse about human dignity generally and about dignity in death specifically .
It is indicative of this moral impoverishment that despite its oversight responsibilities for the ODDA , the Oregon Department of Human Services did not , in its reporting form , even ask whether a concern about a “ loss of dignity ” was a contributing factor in patient requests for lethal drugs until after five years of implementation .
During the years those questions was asked , from 2003 to 2007 , 82 percent of patients are reported by physicians to have expressed concerns about diminished dignity in dying .
That should come as no surprise ; in fact , the surprise is that the figure is n’t closer to 100 percent .
However , the figure remains relatively meaningless since we do not know what patients ( as reported by their physicians ) mean by the term “ dignity . ”
When I ask about the features of a dignified death in public forums , the question typically fails to start discussion — either because citizen participants have not thought of “ dignity ” in any terms other than this politicized context , or because its meaning is so patently obvious that the answer should n’t need stating : that dignity refers to patient control over dying , and especially patient “ choice ” over the manner and timing of one ’s death .
Dignity is thereby reduced to a notion of autonomy .
This truncated understanding of dignity as a matter of personal choice is an example of the impoverishment of our moral discourse .
Certainly , there are scholars who have sought to provide more robust and substantive accounts of dignity , and the President ’s Council on Bioethics is to be commended for taking on the subject in its recent anthology Human Dignity and Bioethics .
But wherever the philosophical and bioethical discussion stands , the civic discussion remains badly muddled by the confusion of autonomy and dignity .
Finally , in what does the integrity of medicine as a profession and moral vocation consist ?
Longstanding tradition has affirmed medicine as a vocation directed toward the good of healing , and that tradition has generally taken healing to be incompatible with physician facilitation of death or killing of patients .
There is little question that healing presumes a responsibility to end or ameliorate pain or suffering , but that did not by itself warrant permission to relieve suffering by ending the life of the sufferer .
A second tradition , extraneous to medicine , needed to be invoked to make this step morally , and within bioethics that tradition was found in the resources of political liberalism , with its powerful corollary of patient empowerment and respect for patient choices .
In many circumstances , the goal of healing coincides with a respect for patient self - determination , but not always — as the case of physician participation in hastening death seems to show .
This formed the broad philosophical context for the Bush administration ’s specific objections to the ODDA — that physician prescription of controlled substances with the intent to hasten a terminal patient ’s death was not a legitimate purpose of medicine ; in short , that such actions violated the ethical integrity of medicine .
In its Gonzales decision disagreeing with the administration , the Supreme Court did not really address the issue of how medicine coheres as a profession when it is shaped by both a tradition of healing and a tradition of respect .
We would not say that the role of a medical professional is to do whatever patients or health care consumers request ; that understanding would eviscerate the concept of “ profession ” altogether .
Alternately , we would not want to vest all moral authority in the relationship of physician and patient in the physician because of a presumed commitment to healing — thereby reviving the tradition of medical paternalism or empowering physicians to make every possible use of conscience clauses anytime there is a disagreement with a patient .
A crucial task for the medical profession and its interpreters in the wake of past and current proposals for “ death with dignity ” is to recompose its vocational ( and sometimes personal ) integrity in light of these at times contradictory traditions .
A brief personal assessment in conclusion : I have argued in the past that the Oregon Death with Dignity Act was a moral mistake .
I have never agreed with the objections based on consequentialist catastrophes , but rather my opposition stemmed from a moral framework that permits the taking of human life — whether that be in self - defense , capital punishment , war , or end - of - life care — only as a last resort , and it has not seemed that society , or the state of Oregon specifically , had exhausted all alternatives — including better pain control , more and earlier referrals to hospice care , and effective education on advance directives — to achieve the goals of end - of - life care such that the last resort condition was satisfied .
After a decade of living in a state where physician - assisted suicide has gradually reached the point of eliciting a “ ho - hum ” in the newspaper , I find myself still affirming that there are other ethically preferable policies to achieve patient choice , control , and “ dignity ” in the end of life , even while recognizing that individual patients do sometimes find themselves confronted with the need to employ that “ last resort . ”
Suddenly the dividing lines in British politics are vividly clear .
They could easily become more blurred again , but for now voters cannot complain about a lack of choice as the next election moves into view .
In his pre-Budget report yesterday , Alistair Darling introduced the most overtly progressive package of measures since the Government came to power in 1997 .
Low earners and pensioners are the main beneficiaries .
Nearly all of us will pay for it later , but the wealthy will pay more .
In the meantime the Government 's objective to abolish child poverty remains in place while so many other policies and previously held assumptions are scrapped .
It has taken a recession for Gordon Brown and Darling to be more candid about what it takes to achieve a fairer society .
The collapse in the financial markets seems to have given them the confidence to tip toe away more openly from the Reagan / Thatcher orthodoxies that cast a fearful spell over new Labour for more than a decade .

But I would be very surprised if Darling 's package marks the end of New Labour and its instinct to calculate politically , working out obsessively and defensively where it will be placed in the emerging divide with the Conservatives .
It would have been surprising if the architects of yesterday 's package had behaved in such a fashion .
As well as Brown and Darling , both cautious politicians , other contributors included Peter Mandelson and Ed Balls , hardly known as reckless risk takers with the electorate .
These are people who want to win the next election and not to lose it in a blaze of principled glory .
Instead this is in some ways a characteristically new Labour response to an economic crisis even though it so obviously marks a break with the past .
Indeed , Darling hit upon several new third ways towards a supposedly calmer economic climate .
The Chancellor is going on a spending spree , but not for very long .
He will put up income tax , but not yet .
VAT will come down , but you better be quick as this is temporary .
In other words the political battle ground is subtler than it seems .
Both Labour and the Conservatives are committed to achieving economic stability in what was previously known with convenient imprecision as the medium term .
Yesterday , Darling spelt out that as far as he is concerned the medium term is in 2015 .
The immediate debate is over which party has the best policies to get us there .
It is not a return to the old debates about " tax and spend " or indeed a counter - intuitive reversal of the old debate with Labour cutting taxes and Conservatives opposing them .
It is over which party can be trusted to bring about a more stable economy as soon as possible .
Brown has calculated that there is widespread support for a fiscal stimulus now , that people are not daft and know it will have to be paid for later .
He plans to go into the next election arguing that those on high income should pay more and that there should be spending cuts from " efficiency savings " .
There is no longer any pretence that such huge levels of borrowing can be paid for out of economic growth in the future , although in a very new Labour twist the Government has a get - out clause .
Darling said he would " review the tax - raising proposals " in the light of the economic situation nearer the time .
The outcome of that review will be interesting if Labour is still behind in the opinion polls at the time .
Like Harold Wilson , a wily predecessor , Brown likes to keep his options open .
In the meantime the shadow Chancellor , George Osborne , clings to his proposal to set up an independent body to monitor their spending and borrowing levels if they win the next election .
This hints at a new discipline , and gives him some space to attack the Government 's soaring borrowing levels , but hinting and setting up independent bodies are easier than coming up with precise examples of where spending will be cut .
Osborne was in vivacious and witty form in the Commons yesterday .
He always is .
I do not know why his Tory detractors were so pleasantly surprised .
But Cameron and Osborne will have to put forward some precise spending reductions before the election and some tax increases as well in order to be credible in a campaign .
I doubt if it will be enough to hide behind such an independent " tax - and - spend " body in the run up to the election .
When will that campaign take place ?
There were few clues in yesterday 's pre-Budget report .
Some of the tax increases come into effect in 2010 or later .
VAT will go up again in 2009 .
The timing of the election will be determined by other factors , not least the mighty opinion polls .
If Labour enjoys a sustained lead in the polls next year , I suspect Brown will go for it , but this is a package for the long haul and by no means the end of the matter .
The year after seems more likely to me .
There will be many more twists and turns in the coming months , let alone into 2010 , the deadline for the next election .
But Brown has not changed as a tactician .
He made a political judgement in 1997 that he had to win the trust of voters before he could invest in public services and in the end he got the space to put up public spending .
Now he makes a judgement that in order to regain the lost respect of the electorate , the economy must be kick started by government spending and tax cuts that will be paid back later .
For reasons of political prudence he calculates that the most cautious route is to take risks over borrowing .
I do not believe he had any alternative .
A few minutes after Darling delivered his statement Barack Obama announced that his first priority would be a major fiscal stimulus early next year .
They will be happening everywhere .
But will voters blame Brown when the prospect of tax rises loom at the next election ?
He has calculated that fairness and a sense that an economic recovery is in sight will do the trick , but he does not know for sure .
There might not even be the prospect of an economic recovery by then in which case he is doomed .
Events such as yesterday give the misleading impression of a government that can confidently pull the levers and determine outcomes .
In terms of the next election and the economy Brown and Darling contemplate the future with their fingers crossed .

Nov. 7 , 2008  --
While shoppers are cutting back on almost everything , sales of one item are suddenly soaring -- guns .
Buyers across the country are snapping up firearms at a record pace
At 9 a.m. today , the counter was already crowded at Cheaper Than Dirt , a discount gun and ammunition store in Fort Worth , Texas .
" Everyone is here for the same reason : Buy it now or you 're not going to have a chance in the future , " said Charlie Street , a gun owner .
At Cheaper Than Dirt alone , more than $ 100,000 in guns and ammunition have been sold every day since Election Day .
Buyers are stocking up before President - elect Barack Obama takes office .
" Election Day , people wake up and say , ' Obama , oh my ! ' " said Dewayne Irwin , owner of Cheaper Than Dirt .
" It 's the knee - jerk reaction but it 's good for business . "
Business is so good that Irwin spent the morning furiously calling suppliers to find more guns .
" You can't find an AK - 47 from a distributor anywhere in the nation , " Irwin said , looking at his computer and checking on inventory .
Sales are brisk across the West .
Background checks for new gun owners jumped 15 percent last month , according to Federal Bureau of Investigation data .
Colorado just set a record for the highest number of background checks for new gun owners , nearly 1,500 in a single day , according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation .
Obama says he supports the right to bear arms with reasonable restrictions .
But that has not been enough reassurance for some people or enough to quell the spreading fear among gun owners .
The National Rifle Association
Web site encouraged NRA members to go out and buy guns .
The site 's news scroll read , " Gun stores report brisk business after Obama election >>>>
Run on Guns in Texas ! "
Some guns are selling more than others .
Assault rifles are especially popular because Obama supports renewing the expired federal ban on assault weapons .
For some voters , issues like the economy took precedence over gun control .
" One of the strangest things I 've had happen in the past few weeks was that I 've had people coming in here wearing Obama buttons and Obama T - shirts , " Glen Parshall , owner of a local Fort Worth gun shop .
" [ They ] tell me they 're in here to buy them before he bans them . "
A port of Ruby 1.9 for Symbian is now available , a Ruby 1.8 version has been available for some time ( as well as Python for Symbian ) .
Besides Symbian's Ruby , there is n't too much support for Ruby on mobile phones right now .
It 's possible to run Ruby 's ARM version on Android .
Since Android is Java based , another option would be to get JRuby to run on Android .
One issue is that Android does n't execute Java bytecodes , but instead Dalvik bytecodes ( JVM bytecodes have to be translated to Dalvik bytecodes ) .
In a discussion on the jruby - user list , JRuby 's Charles Nutter lists possible solutions :
There 's two possible execution scenarios that would work with these limitations :
* Pure interpreted , where all code gets parsed on the device and executed with our AST - walking interpreter logic .
This would probably be slower than we'd like , but easy to make work .
* Pure compiled , with all invokers / handles generated ahead - of - time as well .
Both cases are already possible in the current codebase ; the only trick would be producing a deliverable . jar that provides only the one and has no dependencies on the other .
Running JRuby on JME is is not really an option today .
A port of JRuby to JME was presented at JavaOne 2007 .
The Zip file at the linked location contains the slides of the JavaOne presentation , which details the process involved in getting a subset of JRuby to run on JME .
Since JME is a cut down version of Java , getting JRuby to run involves a rewrite of large parts of JRuby .
JRuby 's current versions rely on Java 5 - but as the slides show , JME lacks classes and methods added as far backs as Java 1.2 .
Among the bigger omissions are Regular Expressions or large parts of the Collections API .
Another option might soon become available in the form of IronRuby and Mono for the iPhone .
While the iPhone AppStore does n't allow to download interpreters , the latest Mono versions have a solution : Ahead of Time compilation , ie .
code in CIL is compiled to CPU instructions , in the iPhone 's case to ARM instructions .
Since IronRuby can compile Ruby code to CIL , instead of interpreting them , it 's possible to compile a Ruby application down to CIL , AOT compile it and run that on the iPhone .
As Miguel de Icaza mentions , a few minor issues remain before IronRuby code can be made to run :
Of course , once you remove the JIT you will not be able to use any dynamically generated code .
This means no Reflection .
Emit dynamically and at least for the time being or no IronPython / IronRuby .
John Lam told me at the PDC that they are looking into bringing static compilation for IronPython / IronRuby / DLR back , so this might just be a short - lived limitation .
One recalls the comic character of Michael Goldfarb declaring only last week that Obama liked palling around with anti-Semites .
Funny how Obama 's chief of staff makes Goldfarb look like a goy .
Josh Green 's 2005 piece on Rahm Emanuel is worth a read .
Money quote :
Friends and enemies agree that the key to Emanuel ’s success is his legendary intensity .
There ’s the story about the time he sent a rotting fish to a pollster who had angered him .
There ’s the story about how his right middle finger was blown off by a Syrian tank when he was in the Israeli army .
And there ’s the story of how , the night after Clinton was elected , Emanuel was so angry at the president ’s enemies that he stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues from the campaign , grabbed a steak knife and began rattling off a list of betrayers , shouting " Dead ! . . . Dead ! . . . Dead ! " and plunging the knife into the table after every name .
" When he was done , the table looked like a lunar landscape , " one campaign veteran recalls .
" It was like something out of The Godfather .
But that ’s Rahm for you . "
Of the three stories , only the second is a myth Emanuel lost the finger to a meat slicer as a teenager and never served in the Israeli army .
But it ’s a measure of his considerable reputation as the enforcer in Clinton ’s White House that so many people believe it to be true .
You do n’t earn the nickname " Rahmbo " being timid .
Dehydra
Mozilla を大書き換えする Mozilla2 プロジェクトの目標設定はえらく野心的で , 2004 年から話があるのに当分終わりそうにない .
傍目にそりゃ無理だろという目標も多い.
XPCOMGC なんていかにも無謀だ .
参照カウントをやめて JavaScript と同じ GC を使おうぜという話 .
JS と C++ のオブジェクトが混ざっても平気だよ...と言われても困る.
数百万行ある Mozilla 相手にそんな書き換えを敢行するとは , ロケット科学を通りこして魔術的だと言っていい.
それが無理だからこそ C++ は呪われた言語で , Microsoft も逃げだしたんじゃなかったの ？
そんな外野の心配を他所に , Mozilla のプログラマ Benjamin Smedberg は Boehn GC と jemalloc くっつけたいんだけど良いアイデアない ?
なんて話をしている .
その前に色々やることがあるだろとつっこみたいところだけれど , 実際のところ彼らはやること ...
手動だと絶望的な大書き換えを自動化するツールの開発
... をやっていた .
Dehydra はその成果の一つ .
さわってみたらなかなか優れものだった.
Dehydra GCC
Dehydra は C++ 用のコード解析ツール .
GCC のプラグインとして動く .
概観は GCC Summit の会報 に載っている .
( " Using GCC Instead of Grep and Sed " というやつ . )
Dehydra は GCC 構文木やら型情報やらを JavaScript のオブジェクトにマップし , ユーザの JavaScript コードに引き渡してくれる .
JavaScript で GCC のプラグインを書ける イメージ .
ただしそのオブジェクトモデルを GCC に書き戻すことはできない .
読むだけ. だから最適化なんかはできない. でも解析には十分だ .
オブジェクトモデルは Java のリフレクションくらいの粒度でさわれる .
型情報だけでなく制御構造なんかも調べたい時は , Dehydra の拡張である Treehydra を使う .
Treehydra は GCC の内部表現である GIMPLE の JavaScript マッピングだという .
自分の書いたソースコードをパースするのは永年人類... はともかく C++ プログラマの夢だった .
Dehydra はその夢を叶えてくれる .
Hello , Dehydra
g++ にパッチをあてるなど , Dehydra のビルド手順は少し面倒 .
ただ 指示 に従えばはまりどころはない .
ビルドをしたら , さっそくさわってみよう .
コールバックや組込み API の一覧はこれ .
手始めにこんなスクリプトを書く :
// hello.js function process_type(c ) { print( c ) ; }
process_type ( ) は型定義毎に Dehydra から呼ばれるコールバック .
引数のオブジェクトには C++ クラスの型情報が入っている. 上のコードはそのオブジェクトをプリントするだけ.
次に解析する C++ のコードを用意する . とりあえず簡単なやつ .
// hello.cpp class Hello { public : void say ( int n ) {} private : int n ; } ; struct Bye { void farewell ( Hello* hello ) { hello -> say ( 1 ) ; } } ; int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { return 0 ; }
Dehydra を実行する .
プラグインは g++ ( 独自にビルドしたやつ ) の引数に指定する .
$ ~/src/dehydra/gcc/bin/g++ \ - fplugin=/home/omo/src/dehydra/dehydra-gcc/gcc_dehydra.so \ -fplugin-arg=hello.js \ hello.cpp - S -o /dev/null
実行するとこんなリテラル風文字列が出力される.
実物は改行がないので適当に整形した.
# 1={kind : " class " , name : " Hello " , members : [ {name : " Hello : : say ( int ) " , member Of : #1 # , isExtern : true , isFunction : true , type:{type:{name : " void " } , parameters : [ #2={min:{value : " -2147483648 " , type :#2#} , max :{value : " 2147483647 " , type : #2#} , isSigned : true , precision : 32 , name : " int " }]} , loc:{_source_location :733 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 6 , column : 16} , access : " public "} , {name : " Hello : : ch " , member Of : #1 # , type :#3={min:{value : " - 128 " , type : #3#} , max : {value : " 127 " , type : #3#} , isSigned : true , precision : 8 , name : " char"} , loc:{_source_location:980 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 8 , column : 7} , access : " private "} ] , size_of : 1 , loc:{_source_location :462 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 4 , column : 1}} # 1= {kind : " struct " , name : " Bye " , members : [ {name : " Bye : : farewell ( Hello * ) " , memberOf : #1 # , isExtern : true , isFunction : true , type : {type :#3={name :" void " } , parameters : [ {isPointer : true , precision : 32 , type : #2={kind : " class " , name : " Hello " , (...上と同じ定義がつづく ... ) }}]} , loc:{_source_location :1513 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 12 , column : 28} , access : " public "} ] , size_of:1 , loc:{_source_location:1358 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 11 , column : 1}}
クラス名 , メンバ変数や関数名 , その引数や戻り値の型 ... クラスの情報はだいたいとれるかんじ .
関数引数や変数などの型情報も再帰的に含まれている. だから相互依存のあるクラスを print ( ) すると大変. オブジェクトを直接 print ( ) するのは素朴な例だけにしたい .
継承 , 仮想関 数
継承や仮想関数はどうなるだろう. こんな C++ コードを与えると ...
class Base { public : virtual ~ Base ( ) {} virtual void bark ( ) = 0 ; } ; class Derived : public Base { public : virtual void bark ( ) {} } ;
こうなる .
# 1={kind : " class " , name : " Base " , members : [ {name : " Base : : ~Base ( ) " , member Of : #1 # , isFunction : true , isVirtual : true , type : {type :#3={name :" void " } , parameters : [ #2={ ... , name : " int " }]} , loc:{_source_location :2525 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 20 , column : 16} , access : " public "} , {name : " Base : : bark ( ) " , member Of : #1 # , isExtern : true , isFunction : true , isVirtual : " pure " , type : {type : #3 # , parameters : []} , loc:{_source_location :2661 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 21 , column : 24} , access : " public " } ] , size_of : 1 , loc:{_source_location :2265 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 18 , column : 12}} # 4={kind : " class " , name : " Derived " , bases : [ {access : " public " , type : #1={kind : " class " , name : " Base " , ...}} ] , members : [ {name : " Derived : : bark ( ) " , member Of : #4 # , isExtern : true , isFunction : true , isVirtual : true , type : {type : #3 # , parameters : []} , loc:{_source_location:3297 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 26 , column : 20} , access : " public " } ] , size_of : 1 , loc:{_source_location:3050 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 24 , column : 29}} ( {variant Of : # 1={kind : " struct " , name : " __class_type_info_pseudo " , ... , size_of : 1 , loc:{_source_location :2 , file : " < built - in > " , line : 0 , column :0}} ) ( {variantOf : #1={kind : " struct " , name : " __si_class_type_info_pseudo " , ... , loc:{_source_location :2 , file : " < built - in > " , line : 0 , column :0}} )
サブクラスの bases プロパティに親クラスの配列がはいっているほか , メンバ関数にも isVirtual プロパティができた .
gcc がこっそり使う型も出力されている .
( デストラクタに整数型の引数があるのはなんでだろ. 多重継承対策 ? )
テンプレー ト
テンレートはどうかしら .
template < class T> struct Templated { T& deref ( T* t ) { return *t ; } } ;
...何も出力されない. インスタンスを使ってみよう .
class UseTemplate { public : void int_t( Templated < int >* t ) { } } ;
どうか :
# 1={kind : " class " , name : " UseTemplate " , members : [ {name : " UseTemplate : : int_t ( Templated < int > * ) " , memberOf : #1 # , isExtern : true , isFunction : true , type : {type : {name :" void " } , parameters : [ {isPointer : true , precision : 32 , type : {kind : " struct " , name : " Templated < int > " , isIncomplete : true , template : {name : " Templated " , arguments : [ #2={ ... , name : " int " }]} , loc:{_source_location :4174 , file : " hello.cpp " , line :33 , column : 1}}} ]} , loc:{_source_location:5099 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 40 , column :30} , access : " public " } ] , size_of : 1 , loc:{_source_location:4814 , file : " hello.cpp " , line :38 , column : 1}}
うーん ... テンプレートを使う関数の引数の型に , template プロパティと isIncomplete プロパティが増えただけ .
template はともかく isIncomplete は困る .
インスタンス化の条件が足らないのかな :
class UseTemplate { public : void int_t( Templated < int >* t ) { int x ; t-> deref ( &x ) ; } } ;
やっとでた :
# 1={kind : " struct " , name : " Templated < int > " , members : [ {name : " Templated < T > : : deref ( T* ) [ with T = int ] " , member Of : #1 # , isExtern : true , isFunction : true , type : {{... , name : " int "} , parameters : [ {isPointer : true , precision : 32 , type : #2#}]} , loc:{_source_location:3932 , file : " hello.cpp " , line :31 , column : 15} , access : " public " } ] , size_of : 1 , template : {name : " Templated " , arguments : [ # 2# ]} , loc:{_source_location:3790 , file : " hello.cpp " , line :30 , column : 1}}
インスタンス毎に別の型ができるらしい. 邪魔くさいけど , よく考えたら C++ はそんな言語だった . 特殊化もあるし ... template プロパティにはもともとの名前が入っている .
属性
gcc と言えば属性 .
class __attribute__ ( ( user ( " hello_class " ) ) )
Attributed { public : void attred ( ) __attribute__ ( ( user ( " hello_method " ) ) ) {} } ;
こうなる :
# 1={kind : " class " , name : " Attributed " , members : [ {name : " Attributed : : attred ( ) " , member Of : #1 # , isExtern : true , isFunction : true , type : {type : {name : " void " } , parameters : [ ]} , attributes : [ {name : " user " , value : [ " hello_method " ]} ] , loc:{_source_location:5506 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 43 , column : 53} , access : " public " } ] , size_of : 1 , loc:{_source_location :5253 , file : " hello.cpp " , line : 41 , column : 56} , attributes : [ {name : " user " , value : [ " hello_class " ] } ] }
ちゃんと取れている . これで WebSerivce 属性から SOAP スタブを生成できる ! ( やらないけど . )
Mozilla では NS_final 属性で Java の final 相当を表現したり , NS_outparam 属性で出力変数を明示したりしている .
Dehydra を使った解析スクリプトにもこれらの指定を確認するものがあった .
実際のスクリプ ト
Mozilla の xpcom / analysis/ ディレクトリには , 実際に Dehydra を使った解析スクリプトがいくつかチェックインされている .
final.js はわかりやすい .
NS_final 属性のついたクラスが継承されていないことをチェックしている. 他は Treehydra 経由で GIMPLE を読んでいるものも多く .
何をしているのかはよくわからない.
そんなハードコアな解析のひとつ outparam.js は , " NS_SUCCEEDED を返す時だけ出力変数に値を書き込む " というルールをチェックする解析らしい. 開発者の blog に 詳しい解説があった .
でもよくわからん . theorem prover とか言われてもなあ ...
Dehydra には標準ライブラリがあって , 解析スクリプトからも include ( ) されている .
コードは dehydra - gcc ツリーの libs ディレクトリにある .
世間の JS ライブラリほど至れり尽せりじゃないけれど , 関数型チックなユーティリティや gcc マクロの移植などがる .
Web とは毛色が違って楽しい .
私も少しは意味のあるコードを書いてみよう. " override " チェックなんてのはどうか .
override と指定したメソッドは実際に親のメソッドを override しないといけない .
C# や ActionScript3 にある機能 .
override 専用のキーワードがない Java では , @ Override 注釈を使って同じ仕組を実現している .
これを真似してみた .
コードは例のごとく github へ .
こんな C++ コードを与えると ...
# define MY_OVERRIDE __attribute__ ( ( user ( " MY_override " ) ) ) class Base { public : void neverOverride ( ) {} virtual void should Override ( ) {} virtual void should OverrideByGrandBaby ( int ) {} } ; class Derived : public Base { public : // OK. virtual void should Override ( ) MY_OVERRIDE {} // NG : 存在しないメソッドをオーバーライドしようとした virtual void badOverride ( ) MY_OVERRIDE {} // NG : 名前が同じで引数の違うメソッドをオーバーライドしようとした.
virtual void should Override ( int ) MY_OVERRIDE {} // NG : virtual でないメソッドをオーバーライドしようとした virtual void neverOverride ( ) MY_OVERRIDE {} // MY_OVERRIDE 指定がないのでチェックしない virtual void notOverride ( ) {} } ; class Grandbaby : public Derived { // OK .
祖父クラスのメソッドをオーバーライド. virtual void shouldOverrideByGrandBaby( int ) MY_OVERRIDE
{} } ;
こんな結果になる .
$ ~/src/dehydra/gcc/bin/g++ \ - fplugin=/home/omo/src/dehydra/dehydra-gcc/gcc_dehydra.so \ -fplugin-arg=override.js \ override.cpp - S -o /dev/null OK : Derived :: shouldOverride ( ) ovrrides Base:: shouldOverride ( ) NG : Derived : : badOverride ( ) violates overriding constraint !
NG : Derived : : shouldOverride( int ) violates overriding constraint !
NG : Derived :: neverOverride ( ) violates overriding constraint !
OK : Grandbaby::shouldOverrideByGrandBaby( int ) ovrrides Base:: shouldOverrideByGrandBaby( int )
NG の行が 不正な MY_OVERRIDE 指定のメソッドを示している .
私の理解の範囲では正しく動いているかんじ.
override .js でやっているのは , 親クラスをたどって同名同型のメソッドを探すだけ.
100 行くらいしかない .
いくつかバグがあるとして , そういうのを直したところで 2-300 行くらいで済むとおもう .
300 行でこんなチェックができるなら悪くないでしょ.
Dehydra 周辺 : DXR
Dehydra の用途はバグ探しに限らない .
DXR ツールでは Dehydra で取得できるクラス情報を RDB に保存し , 継承関係やメソッドの呼び出し元を検索できる .
Eclise のコードブラウザみたいなかんじ .
字句の検索しかできない 従来のクロスリファレンス より強力そうだ .
( 開発者の blog によれば , まだデモ段階なのでいじめないでくれとのことです. )
文書化の支援ツールでは今のところ doxygen が強いけれど , gcc と結託できる Dehydra ベースで作った方が理不尽な思いをすることは少ない気もする.
この路線は頑張ってほしいなあ .
Dehydra 周辺 : Pork
Dehydra や Treehydra はソースコードを解析することしかできない. けれど Mozilla2 の野心は自動リファクタリングにある .
つまり自動でコードを書き換えようとしている.
Mozilla の Pork プロジェクト は
Oink という静的解析ツールセットのフォークで , その書き換えを目的にしている .
フォークというあたりに Dehydra を上回る魔窟感が漂っている .
複数のツールセットが寄せ集まってビルドも面倒そう.
あまり近づきたくないので , 開発者による説明 を 孫引きしてお茶をにごしたい .
Pork の基盤は Elsa というに拡張可能 な C++ パーサ. C++ で色々プラグインを書けるらしい. ( 参考 Techtalk . ) もともとはすべての静的解析を
Elsa ベースでやる予定だったけれど , 保守が大変やら何やらの理由で Dehydra - GCC を併用すことになった(と GCC Summit の記事に書いてあった ) .
Elsa はもともと Mozilla のソースがビルドできず , しかも本家は開発がとまっている .
だから Mozilla 関係者はバグをとりつつだましだまし使っているんだそうな .
Elsa の構文木はファイル内での構文要素の行数や位置を完全に記録している .
おかげで構文木を変更して書き戻す曲芸ができるらしい.
ツリー をみると , クラス名をつけかえる " renamer " や , 出力変数を戻り値に書き換える " outparamdel " などの ツールをみることができる .
おっかねー ...
混沌とした Pork の中にも単独で使い道のありそうなツールはある .
Pork で採用され た C プリプロセッサの mcpp は , 構文木変 更 -> 書き戻しのフローを実現するためにプリプロセスの過程を注釈として埋め込んでくれるらしい.
ちょっと試してみよう . こんなコードを...
// hello-mcpp.cpp # define MY_ASSERT ( cond ) if ( !( cond ) ) { abort ( ) ; } int main ( int argc , char* argv [ ] ) { MY_ASSERT ( 1 ) ; return 0 ; }
まずは普通にプリプロセスする :
$ cpp hell - mcpp.cpp
# 1 " hello-mcpp.cpp " # 1 " < built -in > " # 1 " < command line > " # 1 " hello-mcpp.cpp " ... int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { if ( ! ( 1 ) ) { abort ( ) ; } ; return 0 ; }
mcpp を使ってみる :
$ ~/src/mcpp/mcpp-2.7.1/src/mcpp -K hello-mcpp.cpp
/*m__STDC_HOSTED__*/
/*m__STDC_VERSION__*/
/*m__i386*/ /*m__MCPP*/

That trout 's nociceptors are probably firing like crazy .

We know that pain is uncomfortable , but what exactly is going on in our bodies that causes us to wince and tear up ?
According to the International Association for the Study of Pain , pain is a twofold experience .
First , you have the neurobio­logical process of our nerves communicating with the brain .
Second , there 's the emotional response to pain that varies from person to person .
( For more details , you can read about humans ' pain response in How Pain Works . )
Despite its bad reputation , pain can be a handy survival tool .
Think about the sensory reaction of putting your hand on a hot stove , registering the burn and retracting your arm .
In this way , pain protects us .
It tells your body that you 're in danger of tissue damage and need to get to safety .
Nociceptor nerve cells in our bodies deliver that initial pain - related communiqué along a route through the central nervous system to the brain .
Research has shown that other mammals , birds and fish also have nociceptors .
The presence of those nerve cells implies that fish have the sensory capability to recognize when something is harming their bodies .
Hence , fish can experience the neurological pain process .

One of the primary arguments against fish having a sense of pain is that their brains lack the structural elements , namely the neocortex , necessary for it .
Although fish 's brains are certainly less complex than ours , they are n't mindlessly floating around in the water .
Akin to the fight - or - flight response , fish have chemicals in their bodies that are released when they 're in danger [ source : Chandroo , Duncan and Moccia ] .
Fish also possess pain nerve fiber tracts in their bodies that are similar to those that tetrapods ( vertebrates with four limbs ) have [ source : Chandroo , Duncan and Moccia ] .
Overall , the scientific consensus is that fish have the anatomical requirements to demonstrate neurophysiologic and behavioral reactions to pain as a means of survival [ source : Braithwaite and Huntingford ] .
However , little evidence exists to suggest that the fish also react emotionally to pain like humans .
As another way of safeguarding our bodies , our pain response comes with a negative emotional reaction that excites the amygdala in our brains and forms a memory of the unpleasant effect of a particular stimulus .
For that reason , most children will touch a hot stove only once .
Fish brains do contain an amygdaloid complex , but it produces aggression rather than fear [ source : Chandroo , Duncan and Moccia ] .
Nevertheless , fish are able to form sensory memories .
For instance , trout can remember how to avoid getting caught in fishing nets months after the initial experience [ source : Donkin ] .
So while it remains unclear whether fish genuinely suffer from pain , memories of it stick in their brains .
If fish can sense pain but do n't necessarily feel it emotionally like humans , where does that leave us ?
The fishing industry has already instituted catch - and - release policies to reduce the number of purposeless fish deaths .
Some fishermen use barbless hooks and necks that cut down a fish 's struggle time before being reeled in .
As for the lobster , chefs may kill them by striking them swiftly through the eyes rather than dropping them into the boiling water alive [ source : Wallace ] .
Ether way , it 's morally debatable .
For some people , no amount of concrete proof of a fish 's agony could tear them away from hooking a fresh bass or trout .
To others , people who fish are detestable because they inflict pain onto another living being .
Whichever side of the line you stand on , there 's one thing easily agreed on : Whether fish , fowl or mammal , neurological pain happens to us all .
It 's the capacity for suffering that remains up for dispute .

" For the first time since President Eisenhower , the Castro brothers are becoming aware that come next year they might be dealing with a chief executive in Washington whose policy will be to reestablish dialogue leading to the normalization of relations between Washington and Havana , " said Jose F. Buscaglia , associate professor of American studies and director of UB 's Caribbean Studies Program .
Buscaglia , who has spent the past decade traveling with students to Cuba and who has extensive knowledge of the country 's cultural geography and politics , said the prospect of Obama as president sends a " profound sense of unease into the darkest precincts of power in Havana . "
An Obama administration will be a " perilous threat " to the reigning military government now ruling Cuba , according to Buscaglia .
" Nothing could be more threatening to the long - held views of the Cuban ' comandantes ' and generals , as well as to the institutions they have carefully developed over the last half century to keep their country under the tightest control , " said Buscaglia .
Electing Obama , with his interest to open talks with the Cuban government , would be a more serious threat to the military elites who now control Cuba than the loss of Soviet aid in the early 1990s and the subsequent collapse of the island 's economy , according to Buscaglia .
" Will the Castro brothers engineer a crisis to prevent the reestablishment of normal relations ? " Buscaglia asked .
" Will they be able to contain the people of Cuba , predominantly young and non-white , if they are attracted to a figure sitting in the Oval Office whose face will seem more familiar and whose vision will be all the more coherent than those of the elusive old men who rule their lives from a secret hospital room or a bunker in Havana ? "
The U.S. broke relations with the Cuban government shortly after Fidel Castro became prime minister in 1959 following the overthrow of the Batista government .
Since coming to power , the Bush administration has carried on an unprecedented set of measures intended to raise tensions and impede the normalization of relations with Havana , Buscaglia said .
Electing Republican candidate John McCain would send a different message to Cuba , Buscaglia said .
McCain would continue to support the Bush doctrine of isolating Havana , especially since McCain seems to hold a particular grudge against the Castro brothers whose agents he still blames for some of the harshest interrogation methods used against him when he was a POW in Vietnam , Buscaglia said .
An Obama victory would be fundamentally different , Buscaglia said .
It could also significantly change the power structure in what Buscaglia called the " Story of Two Cities " played out in the Miami - Havana connection .
After two consecutive elections won by George W. Bush with the support of the Cuban exile community in Florida , the wealthiest and politically most - powerful sector of the Latino community in the U.S. may stand to lose much clout in the power centers of what in Havana is known as the " monster " or the " empire , " according to Buscaglia .
" An Obama victory could change the balance of power in favor of Chicano , Puerto Rican , and other Central and South American Spanish - speaking constituencies in the U.S. that are more liberal and populist than the often conservative and sometimes outright racist Cuba - American elites , " said Buscaglia .
" This would be no insignificant change as Latinos become the majority of the population of the country .
It could set a new tone on internal political debates and it certainly would be a welcomed change for most of our neighbors in the hemisphere and indeed throughout the world . "
Reported by University of Buffalo
For a man who has just been , in his eyes , excommunicated from both a magazine and a movement founded by his father half a century ago , Chris Buckley , son of the sainted William F. , is doing a creditable job of keeping his upper lip stiff .
“ I ’m still sort of getting my apostate act down , ” Buckley says with a chuckle when I phone him a few days after the unpleasantness unfolded .
“ I ’m reading Apostasy for Dummies . ”
The apostasy in question is , of course , his endorsement of Barack Obama , which provoked such a torrent of outrage and abuse from the right that Buckley felt it only proper to offer to quit his column at National Review — an offer that was taken up , to his great surprise , “ rather briskly , ” as he puts it .
“ I guess it shows , be careful to whom you tender your resignation , because they just might accept it ! ”
Buckley ’s good humor does nothing to conceal his melancholy and bewilderment at this turn of events .
“ I was really quite amazed by the reaction , and I think it shows just how bloody calcified the political discourse has become , and tribalist , and snarling , ” he tells me .
“ I want to say that it ’s a tempest in a teapot , but there seems to be something going on here , and maybe this has accidentally tapped into it . ”
If the Buckley affair were an isolated incident , such talk would be easy to dismiss as self - flattery — but it is n’t .
With the prospect of defeat for John McCain growing more likely every day , the GOP destined to see its numbers reduced in both the House and Senate , and the Republican brand debased to the point of bankruptcy , the conservative intelligentsia is factionalized and feuding , criminating and recriminating , in a way that few of its members can recall in their political lifetimes .
Populists attack Establishmentarians .
Neocons assail theocons .
And virtually everyone has something harsh to say about the party ’s standard - bearer .
Election Day may still be two weeks away , but already the idea - merchants of the right have formed a circular firing squad .
When the weapons of choice shift from pistols to Uzis after November 4 , the ensuing massacre will be for Democrats a source of political opportunity , not to mention endless entertainment .
But for Republicans it will be a necessary passage toward either the revival or reinvention of conservatism .
Nobody serious on the right doubts that the overhaul is at once required and bound to be arduous — but it may take longer and prove even bloodier than anyone now imagines .
To get a sense of the struggle ahead , a good place to start is with Sarah Palin , who has been the flashpoint for the most severe intra-conservative contretemps so far .
In the weeks since her selection as McCain ’s running mate , a startling assortment of name - brand pundits on the right — Kathleen Parker , George Will , David Frum , David Brooks — have pronounced themselves displeased with the pick .
Brooks went so far as to declaim that Palin “ represents a fatal cancer to the Republican Party . ”
Buckley , for his part , tells me that McCain ’s vice - presidential choice was roughly 60 percent of the reason that he decided to endorse Obama .
“ I will readily confess that I was one of many who swooned the day after the announcement , ” he says .
“ But it ’s kind of like dating a supermodel .
There comes a moment , unfortunately , where they start talking . ”
Yet Palin retains the fierce loyalty of a cadre of more populist , grassrootsy voices in the right - wing punditocracy who have denounced the main - line - conservative criticisms of Palin as the snooty , disloyal , and craven attempts of faux Republicans to curry favor with the ascendant liberal elite .
“ They … believe as intellectuals , ” writes one pro-Palin opinionator , Victor Davis Hanson , “ that the similarly astute Obamians may on occasion inspire , or admire them as the like - minded who cultivate the life of the mind — in contrast to the ‘ cancer ’ Sarah Palin , who , with her husband Todd , could hardly discuss Proust with them or could offer little if any sophisticated table talk other than the proper chokes on shotguns or optimum RPMs on snow - machines . ”
Not surprisingly , Sarracuda ’s foes on the right dismiss the counter - backlash more or less out of hand .
When I ask Frum about the apparent class overtones of the anti-anti-Palin argument , he deems it a mere “ rhetorical trope . ”
What he hears instead is the sound of defeatism .
“ The people who defend her have already given up any serious thought of Republicans ’ wielding governmental power anytime soon , ” Frum says .
“ They have already moved to a position of pure cultural symbolic opposition to a new majority .
The people who criticize her do so because we have some hope that we could be in contention in 2012 , and there ’s some risk that she could be the party ’s nominee , and she ’d probably lose — and even if by some miracle she won , she ’d be a terrible president . ”
Brooks , meanwhile , detects a “ more visceral ” impulse at work .
“ There are some folks who live by the culture war and die by the culture war , ” he tells me .
“ And if a bunch of East Coast snobs hate Palin , they should like Palin . ” But Brooks , like Frum , sees the internecine fight over McCain ’s No. 2 as reflecting a deeper set of ideological fissures in the party .
“ Basically , the people who are down on Palin and the campaign McCain is running think that it ’s time to move beyond Reagan and that we ’ve got to go off and do something new , ” he explains .
“ A lot of the people who are defending the campaign and Palin think that we got out of touch with Goldwater and Reagan and we ’ve gotta get back to that . ”
More than any other Republican doctrinal division — between economic and social conservatives , say , or supply - siders and budget - balancers — the split Brooks describes is fundamental to the future of the GOP and the movement that animates it .
The debate has been growing more public ( and heated ) for some time , especially as the functional definition of conservatism was muddied by George W. Bush .
And it accelerated with the nomination of McCain , the most heterodox and idiosyncratic presidential nominee the party has boasted in many moons .
But its pointedness , urgency , and decibel level are all sure to spike in the wake of a McCain defeat , especially if the GOP base in Congress is decimated , leaving the party with little more than rump status .
“ One thing that will certainly happen is a fundamentalist response , ” says Frum . “ ‘ If only we had been more consistently conservative , none of this would have happened ; there ’s still a conservative voting majority out there , and Bush alienated them with his too - centrist policies and various deviations from conservative orthodoxy ; McCain was obviously unacceptable ; and if the voters turned down ham and eggs , it ’s because they wanted double ham and double eggs . ’
That will be one view .
How fast , how dramatically , and what form the alternative will take — that , no , we have a deeper problem — I ca n’t predict .
But it will come . ”
There are , in fact , any number of post - Reagan visions floating around among the eggheads of the GOP .
Newt Gingrich has been contending for some time that the party needs to abandon its posture as resolutely anti-government ; that it needs to adopt a “ pro–good government ” stance of managerial competence .
Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam , in their recent book Grand New Party , made a case for a blend of social conservatism and populist economics to appeal to what they call “ Sam ’s Club voters . ”
And Brooks cites British Tory party leader David Cameron ’s focus on civil society , twinned with an acceptance of a larger state so long as it is fully paid for , as offering a promising example .
“ Supply - siders blew up the old green - eyeshade Republicanism , ” he adds , “ but I think that in the minority that ’s a natural argument for the party to make . ”
The problem , as Brooks is well aware , is that the GOP ’s traditionalists will not let go of the ghost of Reagan readily , if at all .
Though the conservative movement has lost much of its all - in - this - together coherence in recent years , there remains “ a lot of groupthink , ” as Brooks sees it .
“ So that if you ’re Chris Buckley , you ’re seen as a betrayer , and if that mentality sticks around , things will get quite vicious — because that ’s sort of pseudo - Stalinism . ”
All of which makes it likely that the race for the GOP nomination in 2012 could be an ugly , fratricidal affair .
Frum is not alone is fearing that Palin — who , for all her obvious defects , must be the Republican at this moment with the largest , most ardent fan base in the party — will emerge as one of the front - runners the next time around .
The former Reagan economic adviser Bruce Bartlett predicts , indeed , that the Republican primaries will turn into a Palin / Gingrich steel - cage death match ( from his lips to God ’s ears , I say ) .
But history suggests that the rebuilding of the party , whether that means a rejuvenation of conservatism or its root - and - branch reformation , will take much longer than a single election cycle .
Frum points out that it took the Democrats twelve years after the epochal 1980 election to make a substantial break with the party ’s past .
“ And I think there were probably more people in the Democratic Party in 1980 who were willing to rethink the New Deal than there are Republicans in 2008 who are ready to rethink our party ’s first principles , ” he says .
“ So I think it ’s going to be a very long , very difficult conversation . ”
Few people understand better than Buckley just what that might mean .
“ My dad kicked off conservatism in 1955 , Goldwater ran in 1964 , and then Reagan was elected sixteen years after that , ” he notes .
“ So the Republicans could be looking pretty good around , oh , 2032 ! ”
You might think that Buckley is kidding here , but you would be wrong .
Conservatism , he thinks , is facing nothing less than an existential crisis .
The events of recent days may have given him less of a stake in the outcome than before , but still he offers a friendly word of advice for those who care to listen .
“ The smart ones in the movement should get together right after the election at the Greenbrier or the Homestead , you know , where they typically have these kinds of get - togethers , and have a long dark night of the soul , ” he says .
“ And I ’ll tell you what the conference should be called : Conservatism — What the Fuck ? ”

Ruby 1.9.1 Preview Released : Why This Is A Big Deal
By Peter Cooper
In an understated post on the official Ruby blog last night , Yugui ( Yuki Sonoda ) announced the release of Ruby 1.9.1 - preview 1 .
Why To Get Excited
A preview release ?
Why is this a big deal ?
A few reasons why Ruby 1.9.1 is significant , even as a preview release :
Ruby 1.9.1 will be the first stable , production - ready release of the much anticipated Ruby 1.9 series .
The Ruby 1.9 branch is the cornerstone of Ruby 's future .
Much as PHP 5 - style code is replacing PHP 4 - style code , Ruby 1.9's idioms and style will eventually reign ( even if it takes a few years ) .
As of Ruby 1.9.1 - preview 1 , the language features and changes are effectively " frozen . "
Changes to standard libraries for multilingual features are likely to continue , however .
Ruby 1.9.1 - preview 1 allows you - as a developer - to test your code and libraries on what will eventually become the " default " Ruby .
On that last point , as Dave Thomas says in his release summary :
If you are the maintainer for any publicly available Ruby code ( be it a Gem , an application , or whatever ) I strongly urge you to download this preview .
You 'll be doing the community a great service in two ways .
First , the various incompatibilities between 1.9 and 1.8 mean that there 's a chance that your code may not work without some tweaks .
Making those changes now will help others using your code .
Getting Ruby 1.9.1 - preview 1
You can get Ruby 1.9.1 - preview 1 in source form from the official ruby - lang.org FTP site at ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.1-preview1.tar.gz or via HTTP from http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.1-preview1.tar.gz
If you find the ruby - lang.org server slow - as I do - I 've made the .tar. gz available here from Amazon S3 , so you should be able to download it at full speed .
Ruby 1.9 Resources
When Ruby 1.9 was still quite new , James Edward Gray wrote the excellent " Getting Code Ready for Ruby 1.9 . "
Much of it is still very relevant .
Almost a year ago , Sam Ruby wrote a comprehensive set of notes on porting REXML to Ruby 1.9 .
Mauricio Fernandez 's gargantuan " Changes in Ruby 1.9 " is still an excellent reference .
Got any Ruby 1.9 migration tips or tricks of your own ?

Solar Stocks Plummet Despite Obama Victory
November 13th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
With Obama as President - elect , solar stock prices must be sky high at the moment , right ?
Wrong .
If you look at the values of most stocks around election day , they did increase .
This peak was short lived however for most solar companies and it was followed by a huge decline .
Just how steep are we talking ?
( NASDAQ : AKNS ) is a large US - based solar installers for residential and commercial systems in California , New Jersey , New York , and Connecticut .
Their stock was valued at nearly $ 17 at the beginning of the year and is now just above $ 2 .
( NASDAQ : ASTI ) is based in Colorado and produces high efficiency , thin film solar products .
They saw stock prices rise to over $ 25 a share at the beginning of the year , but are currently under $ 4 .
( NASDAQ : ESLR ) is an American company that develops and manufactures solar modules and cells primarily to Europe and the US .
It had stock valued at $ 18 at the beginning of the year and is now just above $ 3 .
( NASDAQ : FSLR ) is an American company specializing in large - scale solar power plants with thin film solar cells .
Their stock prices were $ 300 in May and are currently just over $ 100 .
( NASDAQ : JASO ) is a Chinese monocrystaline solar cell manufacturer that distributes its product through China , South Korea , the US , Germany , Sweden , and Spain .
Its stock dropped from $ 27 this spring to less than $ 3 .
Stocks declined by 29 % yesterday alone .
( NASDAQ : SPWRA ) is a manufacturer of solar cells , solar panels , and roof tiles .
Stock prices reached as high as $ 130 at the beginning of the year and are currently around $ 25 .
( NYSE : STP ) is the world ’s largest producer of solar panels and has four manufacturing centers in China .
Stock prices reached $ 90 in January and are now around $ 10 .
( NASDAQ : YGE ) is based in China and manufactures solar ingots , cells and modules .
Stock prices were as high as $ 40 in January , 2008 and now hover around $ 4 .
Why are solar stocks dropping in value ?
Falling Value of the Euro
Germany and Spain are two of the leading global markets for solar energy , and the European solar market grew by 87 % to 2157 MW in 2007 .
Germany has a very strong feed - in tariff program from the government .
Spain enjoys ideal weather for solar energy combined with strong government incentives .
Europe is a very important market to the solar industry .
“ Just recently the euro depreciated dramatically , more than 23 % .
So we have to adjust our ASP ( average selling price ) to support our customers , ” Yang said .
Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy
To top it off , JA Solar , SunPower and Evergreen Solar among other companies saw losses because of their ties to the defunct Lehman Brothers ( NYSE : LEH ) , where they were involved in convertible bond transactions and stock lending agreements .
“ We estimate JASO would realize ~4 % dilution on stock and incur a non-cash write off of $ 7 M for the book value of the capped call , and also write off a $ 100 M investment in a LEH vehicle , ” said Jeff Pichel , an analyst for Piper Jafrray .
Regarding Evergreen Solar , Pichel said , “ ESLR worse case scenario – lose the $ 39.5 M premium if the capped call transaction with Lehman is not replaced , as well as dilute share count by 30 M ( ~ 25 % ) without getting anything in return for the dilution . ”
Sales Forecasts Decline for Some
Many solar manufacturers ramped up production as demand climbed .
A global slowdown caused some companies to reduce production .
“ At this moment the market reaction has been panic , ” said Samuel Yang , Chief Executive Officer of JA Solar .
Due to the economic conditions , sales forecasts have dropped significantly for some solar companies .
This is rare for the solar market , which has seen unprecedented growth in recent years .
JA Solar reduced its 2008 revenue forecast to between $ 849.5 to $ 878.9 million from the $ 1.05 to $ 1.17 billion it had forecast in October , and said its earnings per share would be near break - even .
They also cut the 2009 revenue forecast to $ 1.5 billion to $ 1.7 billion , which were previously $ 2.0 billion to $ 2.2 billion .
Fourth quarter growth margins would drop to a mere 5 % to 7 % , according to JA Solar , from 23.3 % in the second quarter and 21.6 % in the third quarter .
SunPower , however , reported strong quarterly earnings in October and even raised the 2008 profit forecast slightly .
Net income rose to $ 22.4 million , or $ .26 per share , from $ 8.4 million , or $ .10 cents per share , a year ago .
What Does the Future Hold For Solar ?
On the Bright Side
The US solar market is likely to have more government support under Obama compared to Bush .
He has set a goal to generate 25 % of the US energy from renewables by 2025 .
This is a big goal considering that currently less than 10 % is from renewables , including hydroelectric power .
Also , the renewable energy tax credits that were set to expire were extended and in some cases expanded .
On the Downside
Solar development that depends on financing may see hurdles under the current credit crunch .
The price of certain fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas have recently declined , which may make it more difficult to obtain financing in the short - term .
Hopefully , price drops wo n’t take attention off of the finite quantity of fossil fuels that is dwindling as we speak .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Al Gore ’s Alliance for Climate Protection has some environmental advice for the incoming Obama administration : focus on energy efficiency and renewable resources , and create a unified U.S. power grid .
On Thursday , the group Gore founded rolled out a new media campaign to push for immediate investments in three energy areas it maintains would help meet Gore ’s previously announced challenge to produce 100 percent clean electricity in the United States in a decade .
Pegged to Obama ’s election victory on Tuesday , the Gore group ’s ads on television , in newspapers and online , pose the question , “ Now what ? ”
“ Our nation just made history , ” one video says .
“ We have an historic opportunity to boost our economy and repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
It will create new American jobs , end our addiction to dirty coal and foreign oil and solve the climate crisis . ”
More information on the campaign is available online at repoweramerica.org .
Gore -- former vice president , Nobel Peace laureate and star of the Oscar - winning documentary “ An Inconvenient Truth ” -- has said repeatedly he wants to play no official government role in the fight against climate change .
But with environmental activists talking about a possible “ climate czar ” in President - elect Barack Obama ’s White House , Gore ’s name inevitably gets mentioned .
IMMEDIATE ENERGY INVESTMENTS
The plan advocates immediate investment in energy efficiency , renewable power generation -- including public investment in wind , solar and geothermal technology -- and the creation of a unified national smart grid .
“ Modernize transmission infrastructure so that clean electricity generated anywhere in America can power homes and businesses across the nation , ” the alliance said in a statement .
The alliance favors “ national electricity ‘ interstates ’ that move power quickly and cheaply to where it needs to be ( and ) local smart grids that buy and sell power from households and support clean plug - in cars . ”
Gore and his group are in line with most U.S. environmental groups , which see the next administration as a chance to act to stem global warming , after what many see as the Bush administration ’s stalling on this issue .
R.K. Pachauri , head of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Gore in 2007 , sounded a similar note in a statement issued after the vote .
" The U.S. now has a unique opportunity to assume leadership in meeting the threat of climate change , and it would help greatly if the new president were to announce a coherent and forward looking policy soon after he takes office , " Pachauri said on his blog at blog.rkpachauri.org / .
LOS ANGELES , Dec 12 ( Reuters ) - A nude model resembling the Virgin Mary on the cover of the Mexican edition of Playboy magazine , published only days before a major Mexican festival dedicated to the mother of Jesus , prompted the company ’s U.S. headquarters on Friday to apologize .
The magazine , which hit newsstands on Dec. 1 as ceremonies began leading to Friday ’s pilgrimage to the Mexico City shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe , showed a model wearing nothing but a white cloth over her head and breasts .
She is standing in front of a stained glass window with the cover line , “ We Love You , Maria ” in Spanish .
The model ’s name is Maria Florencia Onori .
The Virgin of Guadalupe , said to have appeared to a sixteenth century Indian peasant , is Mexico ’s most revered Roman Catholic figure and the annual pilgrimage to the Mexico City basilica dedicated to her is one of the world ’s largest religious events .
In a statement , Chicago - based Playboy Enterprises Inc PLA.N said the Mexican edition of the magazine is published by a licensee , and the company did not approve or endorse the cover .
“ While Playboy Mexico never meant for the cover or images to offend anyone , we recognize that it has created offense , and we as well as Playboy Mexico offer our sincerest apologies , ” the statement said .
Raul Sayrols , publisher of Playboy Mexico , said in a statement , “ The image is not and never was intended to portray the Virgin of Guadalupe or any other religious figure .
The intent was to reflect a Renaissance - like mood on the cover . ”
Playboy Mexico printed 100,000 copies of the issue .

SOHO :
Jetpack stuntman makes history by flying across 1,000 ft deep canyon
A daredevil wearing a jet pack has flown across a 1,500 - foot wide canyon in southern Colorado .
Eric Scott took 21 seconds to cross the Royal Gorge at 75 mph on Monday .
It says he did n't use a parachute while flying across the 1,100 - foot deep canyon .
He was wearing a jet pack powered by hydrogen peroxide and developed by Jet Pack International .
The company developed it for stunts , promotions and other events for Go Fast .
' There is no parachute .
There is no safety net .
There is no air bag .
But there is 800 horsepower on my back , ' said the former TV stuntman .
Eric Scott , flies next to the Royal Gorge Bridge , while visitors look on , Monday in Canon City , Colorado
It took just 21 seconds of deafening thrust to take the 45 - year - old across the chasm , setting all kinds of world records .
Scott had never flown more than a couple of hundred yards and had never been that high .
The stuntman had just 33 seconds of fuel on his back , and some of those seconds were needed for starting and hovering to land .
' Fear either makes people suck it up and get it right or they lose it , ' Scott told the Denver Post newspaper .
' I 'm the Evel Knievel that makes it to the other side . '
Eric Scott safely crosses the Royal Gorge west of Canon City
Go Fast Sports & Beverage , which sponsored the stunt , said Scott of Jet Pack International took 21 seconds to cross the Royal Gorge at 75 mph
' He knew if he did n't make it , he was n't going to make it , ' said Troy Widgery , founder and chief executive of Denver 's Go Fast energy drink company , which sponsors Scott and Jetpack International .
' I 've always , since I was a kid , wanted a jet pack , ' Widgery said .
' Who has n't ? '
At 135 lbs , Scott 's pack is the most technologically advanced flying machine in existence , said Eric Strauss , the Boulder aerospace engineer who designed it .
The pack wobbles at around 60 mph — and Strauss knew Scott would need to reach at least 75 mph .
' I knew he would have to reach his highest speed ever - his highest and the pack 's highest speed , ' Strauss said .
' He is so amazing .
He is the best jet - pack pilot in the world . '
It was a question that arose the moment the game 's online level - sharing feature was introduced : what would happen to LittleBigPlanet levels that infringed on popular intellectual property ?
The question never received a straight - forward answer , but now it seems that Sony has made that decision , as the forum community is in an uproar over the apparent silent removal of custom content .
Kotaku is reporting on the clamor that began with the popular LittleBigWorkshop forum and is quickly spreading across forum communities like NeoGAF and GameFAQs .
Users are reporting that copyright - infringing levels , even those with no unsuitable content , are being silently deleted .
" My level was moderated ( read ; deleted ) and now I can't re-publish , " wrote one frustrated gamer .
" There was absolutely nothing offensive whatsoever in the level at all and I was given no explanation as to why they moderated it or why they wo n't even let me republish , even after making changes . "
While original creations tend to be the most memorable in the long run , some of the " tribute " content we 've seen has become the stand - out content for LittleBigPlanet .
Whether it be in the form of an epic platforming level inspired by Indiana Jones , a shoot - em - up level paying homage to Gradius , or a Final Fantasy VI theme song recreated by a track of music objects , these custom levels are really what make LittleBigPlanet great .
Neither Sony nor Media Molecule has publicly commented about these actions , but the outcry is growing , and without some levels being deleted and others with questionable content still there , the lines seem to be rather blurry .
Should the companies change the game 's terms of service to explicitly state that copyright - infringing material will be dutifully moderated , the populated worlds of the LittleBigPlanet " cool levels " section will become barren in a hurry .
We ’ve heard about massage chairs , sled dog puppies , and giant black furniture .
We ’ve heard from contractors , and former best friends , and Mrs. Stevens .
We ’ve been regaled with stories of male - bonding and wine drinking for weight loss in the desert Southwest .
I refer , of course , to the Ted Stevens trial .
All in all the trial has been very … .
Alaskan .
Stevens faces seven felony counts of failure to disclose gifts on his Senate Financial Disclosure Forms .
Today is the day closing arguments begin , and the prosecution is presenting its case right now .
By tomorrow , the jury deliberations will have started .
WASHINGTON – As prosecutors made their final argument Tuesday to jurors in Sen.
Ted Stevens ’ corruption case , they replayed a now - infamous recording of the senator , who told a close friend that the worst that could ever happen to him as a result of a federal investigation would be a little jail time , or perhaps excessive legal bills .
“ Does that sound like someone who really believes he did n’t do something wrong ? ” asked prosecutor Joseph Bottini , an assistant U.S. Attorney from Anchorage who delivered closing arguments for the Justice Department this morning .
[ snip ]
Some of those things Stevens was given were smaller than others , Bottini acknowledged , such as a stained glass window and a generator .
But none of those items were ever disclosed as gifts on his financial disclosure forms , Bottini said .
And “ how he treats these smaller items speaks volumes about how he intended to treat the bigger ticket items , like the home remodel , ” Bottini said .
His attitude was clear when he tried to figure out how to disclose the value of a sled dog his friends bought him at a charity auction , Bottini said .
Stevens , in asking about the dog , wrote an e-mail describing the disclosure requirements as a “ GD ” disclosure form .
“ He calls it his , pardon me , his “ God Damn ” disclosure form , ” Bottini said .
“ That pretty much sums up his attitude .
He ’s not above the law and he can’t evade it simply because he does n’t like it . ”
Alaskans are sitting on the edge of their seats .
The one furthest on the edge ?
Other than Ted himself , it ’s probably Anchorage Mayor , and Stevens ’ Democratic rival for the senate seat , Mark Begich .
An acquittal for Stevens makes his job a lot more daunting .
Molecular crosstalk between two B - cell surface receptors ( green , Y - shaped B - cell receptor and orange cylinder - shaped BLyS receptor ) balances the need to have enough B cells to drive a healthy immune response while at the same time guarding against autoimmunity .
Credit : Michael P. Cancro , Ph.D. , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine can now explain how the body determines whether there are enough mature B - cells in the blood stream at any one time .
These are the cells that produce antibodies against germs to fight infections .
" There is a steady state number of B cells that is considered normal for humans , " says senior author Michael P. Cancro , PhD , Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine .
" We found that molecular crosstalk between two receptors on the surface of B cells balances the need to have enough B cells to make good immune responses , while at the same time guarding against autoimmunity . "
The B - cell crosstalk paper appeared online this week in Nature Immunology .
This and other work from the Cancro lab has important implications for transplantation science and battling autoimmune diseases .
Cancro , first author Jason E. Stadanlick , a PhD student in the Cancro lab , and others found that when more of a protein called BLyS , which binds to a receptor on B - cell surfaces is circulating , more mature B cells can be kept alive .
By adding more BLyS to the system , the " brakes " governing how many immature B cells are allowed to become mature B cells are relaxed .
On the other hand , the body guards against autoimmune diseases such as lupus by preventing the survival of B cells via the other receptor in this equation .
The research from the Cancro lab reveals a complicated interplay between these two receptors that allows them to integrate their signals , which are at odds with one another .
" One receptor sends signals to the cell nucleus that says , 'yes stay alive , the body needs more B cells , ' while the other says ' wait a minute , be careful which B cells are allowed to live . ' "
The Cancro lab also described in a recent Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) paper that if BLyS is neutralized , most B cells die , but the ones in charge of remembering what the body has already been vaccinated against or has been exposed to , remain alive .
Together , these findings should eventually lead to interventions that alter or adjust B cell behavior in the prevention , diagnosis , and treatment of autoimmune diseases .

From Bloomberg ( hat tip reader Lewis B. Sckolnick ) ;
Responding to questions from lawmakers , Bernanke said that should the rescue succeed and spur an economic recovery , that may lead the Fed to raise interest rates sooner than it otherwise would .
For the plan itself , “ I do n’t expect any effect on inflation , ” Bernanke said .
The first trading day after details of the plan emerge , the dollar drops 3 % and oil spikes up .
But Bernanke has convinced himself there is no inflation risk in the Paulson plan .
So way back in April , I first had the idea of editing together inspirational speeches .
Since then , the Dow has dropped 3,000 points and one million jobs have been lost .
The people of the United States are now a ragtag bunch of scruffy underdogs , down by three touchdowns at halftime , with a whole horde of orcs waiting for us right outside those locker room doors .
Inspiration has become something we need .
( By the way , you could n’t tell because it started the sentence , but “ Inspiration ” was capitalized . )
What I ’m trying to say is , I may have just single - handedly saved the economy with this montage :
TRANSCRIPT :
Shame on you .
This could be the greatest night of our lives , but you ’re going to let it be the worst .
And I guarantee a week wo n’t go by in your life you wo n’t regret walking out , letting them get the best of you .
Well , I ’m not going home .
We ’ve come too far !
And I ’m going to stay right here and fight for this lost cause .
A day may come when the courage of men fails … but it is not THIS day .
The line must be drawn HERE .
This far , no further !
I ’m not saying it ’s going to be easy .
You ’re going to work harder than you ever worked before .
But that ’s fine , we ’ll just get tougher with it !
If a person grits his teeth and shows real determination , failure is not an option .
That ’s how winning is done !
Believe me when I say we can break this army here , and win just one for the Gipper .
But I say to you what every warrior has known since the beginning of time : you ’ve got to get mad .
I mean plum mad dog mean .
If you would be free men , then you must fight to fulfill that promise !
Let us cut out their living guts one inch at a time , and they will know what we can do !
Let no man forget how menacing we are .
We are lions !
You ’re like a big bear , man !
This is YOUR time !
Seize the day , never surrender , victory or death … that ’s the Chicago Way !
Who ’s with me ?
Clap !
Clap !
Do n’t let Tink die !
Clap !
Alright !
Let ’s fly !
And gentlemen in England now abed shall know my name is the Lord when I tell our enemies that they may take our lives , but they ’ll never take our Independence Day !
Some behind - the - scenes notes for editing nerds only .
Obviously , there was some fudging to get it all in one aspect ratio .
Some clips were 4:3 , so I had to blow them up to fill a 16:9 frame .
Other clips were 2.35:1 , and I had to blow those up too .
You do n’t really notice , because you ’re watching the finished product in a little box .
The music sort of picked itself .
A problem I always run into doing these videos is that you ca n’t just push a button and make a movie ’s soundtrack magically disappear .
I actually discarded certain clips because they had loud music I could n’t cover up ( Starship Troopers : “ Everyone fights , no one quits . ” )
But there were two clips I felt like I needed that had really loud music – Animal House and Henry V .
So I got those mp3s , synced them up with those two clips , and then dragged the audio out to underscore the entire piece .
For a while , I was going to end it with Henry V to ID4 , like this : “… and hold their manhoods cheap , while any speaks who fought with us upon OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY ! ”
But I like going back to Braveheart , because it ’s sort of a subtle , subconscious fakeout .
The video began with the Braveheart speech , and when William Wallace pops back up , you think it ’s going to end there .
You do n’t expect that last cut to Bill Pullman .
I ’m grateful to Mr. Stokes , who suggested that I use longer clips at the beginning .
At the time I had even more movies packed in there , with more cuts .
But Jordan is usually right , and it definitely works better with more of a build .
My favorite cut : Chaplin as a Hitler - esque dictator , to George C. Scott as Patton .
Not an accident .
The clips at the end are n’t exactly in random order .
It ’s seven shots of characters with arms raised in triumph : the boy from Neverending Story , Rudy , Andy Dufresne , the Grinch , Ferris Bueller , Lincoln , and Rocky .
My favorite speech ?
Animal House , actually .
Maybe it ’s the positive associations we all have with that movie , or the positive associations we all have with Belushi .
But by jingo , it works .

Larry Page & Sergey Brin ; Cofounders , Google : Technological and Moral Vision
How would we find out where our high school crush is working , 20 years after we last saw him , without the inventors of Google ?
But Google brings the world much more than cyberstalking :
It allows us , second grader and Ph.D. alike , to mine information , expand our ideas about a subject , look up scholarly writings via Google Scholar , and even visually explore every inch of our planet with Google Earth .
But Google creators Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted more and took another leap forward with Google.org , their groundbreaking philanthropic organization .
Instead of filing for government - compliant not - for - profit status , Google.org ( unlike most dot - orgs ) is happy to solve problems in the “ for profit ” mode .
According to David Vise , a Pulitzer Prize–winning business journalist and author of The Google Story : Inside the Hottest Business , Media and Technology Success of Our Time , Brin and Page hope the importance of Google.org may someday eclipse that of Google itself .
“ To get more bang for the buck , ” Vise told us , “ they have adopted a hybrid model that goes beyond charitable giving to embrace self - sustaining projects — think microlending — that can be profitable .
In addition to seeding small businesses and putting them on a more market - oriented footing , this positions Google.org to redistribute the funds anew when loans are repaid . ”
Currently focused on an array of initiatives in energy , public health , and global poverty , Google.org tapped Larry Brilliant , a doctor specializing in preventive medicine and public health and the former CEO of two public companies , to serve as its executive director .
Brilliant , founder of both the Seva Foundation , which works around the world to cure and prevent blindness , and the pioneering virtual community the WELL , says the Google duo are not just “ technological visionaries ” but also “ moral and structural visionaries .
The creation of Google.org — a new way to do good in the world with profits from a technology company — could not have happened if Larry and Sergey had not conceived it prior to Google ’s success , ” Brilliant says .
“ After the IPO , it would have been too late .
In a way , they foresaw the future .
Similar things can be said about the way they push the boundaries of renewable energy , organization structures , the way they build buildings , ” Brilliant adds .
“ Heck , these guys are computer geeks , but they are also moral prodigies , and that may well outlast their other legacies .
Their ethical commitments inspired me to come to Google to work with them . ”
Arthur Caplan ; Bioethicist , University of Pennsylvania : Navigating the Minefield of Bioethics Remember when in vitro fertilization , which has produced millions of babies , was controversial ?
Today ’s medical breakthroughs , from genetically engineering ani­mals to rewiring the human brain , pose moral and social dilemmas every bit as divisive , providing grist for Arthur Caplan as he weighs in on the future of science .
Caplan has sorted through the ethical traps of science for the United Nations , the National Institutes of Health , the president of the United States , and the Olympics and has written or edited more than 30 books and 500 articles on ethics in biomedicine .
He has guided us through such issues as the organ donor market ( he opposed the sale of kidneys to the highest bidder ) , the Terri Schiavo case ( he opposed government intervention to keep her alive ) , and the stem cell wars ( he supports embryonic stem cell research ) .
Although he sometimes loses battles against politicians , he often succeeds in swaying public opinion , which in the end may be his proudest achievement .
Caplan has played a singular role in “ democratizing bioethics , ” says James Hughes , executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies .
“ His tireless work translating philosophical debates into understandable ideas , along with his being accessible to the media , has helped millions of people around the world develop more informed opinions about health care and biotechnology .
As a champion of accountable government regulation , universal health care , and individual liberty , he has applied the values of the Enlightenment to the 21st century . ”
James Hansen ; Climatologist and Director , NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies : Fighting Global Warming Al Gore won a Nobel Prize for explaining global warming to the world , but James Hansen was the one who explained climate change to Al Gore .
Back in 1981 , Hansen , a NASA climatol­ogist , was already sounding the alarm : Cli­mate change would accelerate more quickly than originally calculated .
By the time Bill Clinton and Gore were in office , Hansen was writing press releases about the damage of greenhouse gases that had the administration breaking a sweat .
Under the influence of George W. Bush , politicians were so discomfited by his reports , Hansen claims , that they were censored outright .
Yet Hansen became a science adviser to Gore when the ex-V.P. took the word to the street , and many now consider him Gore ’s mentor .
In the wake of Hansen ’s original clarion call , reversing the warming trend has become a mainstream movement , and an entire sector of science has received a flood of funding .
“ Hansen ’s computer modeling allowed him to say unequivocally in the spring of 1988 that humans were heating the planet and that it was going to be a serious problem , ” comments environmentalist Bill McKibben of Middlebury College .
“ He has always been willing to say out loud , in public , and without endless hedging , what his scientific work means for the planet . ”
Harold Varmus ; Former Director , National Institutes of Health : Champion of Open Access Nobel laureate Harold Varmus was one of the driving forces of medical research even before he tried to revolutionize the way scientists do their work .
In the 1970s Varmus and his colleague Michael Bishop discovered the cellular origin of retroviral genes that turn cancerous , launching the modern era of cancer research .
In the Clinton administration , Varmus led the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) and transformed it into a biomedical powerhouse .
“ As director of NIH , Harold cultivated bipartisan support of biomedical research , ” Bishop recalls , “ and sound science was always at the heart of the agenda . ”
Varmus ’s latest challenge has been an attempt to overhaul the system of publishing research in journals so that all papers are freely available on the Internet — instead of only by expensive subscription .
This allows researchers at any level of income , in any part of the world , to build on the body of knowledge .
The manifestation of Varmus ’s effort , the Public Library of Science and its roster of academic publications , has become one of the most cited sources in academic research and has inspired others worldwide to follow its lead .
German heavy tank development began as early as 1937 with the German Armaments Ministry issuing a specification for a new heavy tank to Daimler - Benz , Henschel , MAN and Porsche .
The project however was ignored as the Panzer III and IV had so far proved effective tanks and served well in combat .
It was not until spring 1941 that the project was revived after Hitler was impressed with heavy allied tanks , such as the French Char B1 and British Matilda 1 during the campaign in the west .
At a meeting with Hitler on 26th May , 1941 , the planning for the development of a new heavy tank begun .
During that meeting , Hitler ordered for the creation of heavy Panzers which were to have an increased effectiveness to penetrate enemy tanks ; possess heavier armor than was previously achieved ; and attain a maximum speed of at least 40 km / h .
These key decisions led to the development of a new heavy tank , the Tiger 1 tank and ultimately the King Tiger .
However , no clearly defined objectives or action plans were laid out for the succession of the Tiger 1 tank until January 1943 when the order was given for a new design which was to replace the existing Tiger 1 .
Although the designation implies that the Tiger II is a succession of the Tiger 1 , it is in effect a completely different tank .
The first design consideration for the new tank was the selection of a more effective main gun .
As with the Tiger tank , it was to mount an 88 mm anti tank gun but the main gun on the Tiger II was far more powerful than that on the Tiger 1 .
For the development of the chassis , two firms were contracted to come up with the designs namely Henschel and Sohn of Kassel and Porsche of Stuttgart .
Both firms Henschel and Porsche were responsible for only the chassis and automotive designs .
Turret design was awarded to another firm Krupp of Essen .
Learn more about the development history of the King Tiger
The main gun specification of the King Tiger was to be a variation of the 88 mm anti-aircraft gun .
Although the 88 mm was initially designed for an anti aircraft role , it proved to be an excellent tank killer .
Originally , the intention was to mount an 88 mm Flak 41 into a turret for the Porsche VK4501 ( P ) chassis .
The turret had been originally designed by Krupp to hold the 56 caliber 88 mm KwK 36 gun of the Tiger 1 .
After much experimentation and debate , it was decided in early 1943 that it was not possible to mount the 88 mm Flak 41 .
Krupp had then been contracted to design a new turret that could mount their own version of a 71 caliber 88 mm Kwk 43 gun that could fit in both the chassis for Henschel and Porsche .
The 88 mm gun with the designation KwK 36 and KwK 43 indicated the model number year 36 and 43 .
The Tiger II with the model 43 has a length of 71 calibers ( 71 times 88 mm ) as compared with 56 calibers of the Tiger 1 with model 36 .
The length of the barrel itself is over 20 feet long while the rounds weighed almost 20 kgs .
It is in effect a much more powerful gun than the Tiger 1 .
More about the Tiger I tank
King Tiger with the Henschel ( production ) turret .
Note the length of the 88 mm .
One of the few surviving tanks on display at LaGleize museum .
The King Tiger ’s 88 mm main gun has a muzzle velocity of 1000 m per second when firing armor piercing rounds .
It was highly accurate and able to penetrate 150 mm of armor at distances exceeding 2200 m .
Since the flight time of an armor piercing round at a range of 2200 m is about 2.2 seconds or less , accuracy and correction of fire against moving targets is more important than with older anti tank guns .
This made this heavy predator ideally suited to open terrain where it could engage enemy tanks at long range before the opponent ’s weapons were even in range .
For the chassis , much has been learnt from the sloped armor design of the Russian T - 34 .
As with the Panther , the King Tiger was to have sloped and interlocked front and side armor .
The front armor was 150 mm thick and the side was 80 mm thick .
Both firms Henschel and Porsche submitted their own designs .
Porsche designed the VK4502 ( P ) chassis which was built on the previous VK4501 ( P ) design of the Tiger 1 .
The codename VK was for Volkettenfahrzeuge or " fully tracked experimental vehicle " , 45 means a 45 ton class and 01 represents the first model .
The VK4502 ( P ) chassis had a similar outlook with the Tiger 1 , sharing many similarities such as the suspension and automotive parts .
Two designs were submitted , the first one having its turret mounted centrally and the second had the turret mounted towards the rear with the engine in front .
However , it used copper for the electric transmission which Germany was in shortage of .
This design was rejected and did not enter production .
Henschel production turret .
Henschel designed the VK4503 ( H ) chassis which was very similar in appearance to the Panther .
The front armor was 150 mm thick and sloped at an angle of 50 degrees .
The side was 80 mm thick sloped at 25 degrees .
As with all German tanks at that time , it had a ball mounted MG34 fitted on the right front side of the hull .
The suspension consisted of torsion bars with nine sets of overlapping steel rimmed wheels on each side .
The tracks were 2 feet 8 1/2 inches wide , weighing 2.5 tons .
Henschel ’s design was accepted and destined to enter mass production .
Krupp had designed the turrets to fit both the Porsche and Henschel chassis .
The initial design called P - 2 Turm ( or commonly known as Porsche turret ) mounted a single piece ( monobloc ) barrel of the 88 mm and had a curved mantlet in the front .
The front armor was 100 mm thick , the sides were 88 mm thick sloped at 60 degrees and the top armor was 40 mm thick .
It had space to carry 16 rounds of ammunition in the turret .
However , the curved mantlet in the front acted as a shot trap by deflecting incoming shots downwards towards the roof of the hull .
A new design was ordered to fix this but as an interim measure , it was decided to go ahead with the production of 50 units with this turret .
This was commonly referred to as Porsche turret .
The new design called Serien Turm , or commonly known as Henschel or Production turret was to retain the many features of the Porsche turret and was to be adopted for mass production .
Henschel turret had the front curved mantlet replaced with one 180 mm thick armor plate sloped at 81 degrees .
The sides were altered to slope at 69 degrees and it could carry an additional 6 six rounds or 22 rounds of ammunition in the turret .
The full combat weight was 68,500kg when fitted with the Porsche turret and 69,800kg with the Henschel turret .
Although the two turrets were different in appearance , it had the same layout .
The large overhang at the rear acted as counter balance for the heavy gun .
This additional space was used to store ammunition making the loader ’s job easier .
It had three hatches , the commander ’s hatch on the left , the loader ’s hatch on the right and as escape hatch in the rear .
The turret housed three of the five crews .
The commander ’s position was on the center left , the gunner below and in front of him and the loader on the right .
For the engine , it used a Maybach HL 230 P30 engine which was the same as was fitted to the Panther .
It produced 700 hp of output which was inadequate for a tank this size , which was 11 tons heavier than the Panther .
This made the King Tiger miserably underpowered and susceptible to surprise flank attacks .
Although a maximum road speed of 41.5 km / h has been achieved during trials , it could sustain only 35 to 38 km/h on the road and 17 km/h cross country .
The transmission was an 8 speed Maybach OLVAR EG 40 12 16 B gearbox ( 8 forward and 4 reverse ) .
Besides the electric starter motor , the engine is also equipped with a crank starter to conserve battery power on cold days .
Fuel consumption was enormous with the Mayback V12 engine needing 500 liters per 100 km .
This was a problem at that time as Germany was in constant shortage of fuel .
It carried 860 liters of fuel giving it a maximum range of about 110 km on the road and 80 km cross country .
As with the Tiger 1 , the massive size of the tank could not fit into the standard rail compartment .
To overcome this , two sets of tracks were needed , one narrower 66cm transportation tracks and a wider 80 cm combat tracks .

Combat Service
Officially designated Panzerkampfwagen VI Sd. Kfz 182 , the King Tiger was placed into service early 1944 .
It served in the western and eastern front notably in the battle of Normandy , operation " Market Garden " in Holland , and the offensive in Ardennes .
It also served in various other operations in Poland , Hungary , Minsk and a small number also defended Berlin in April and May 1945 .
With its great firepower and thick armor , it proved to be more than an opponent for any tank the allied forces could field .
However , the size and weight of the King Tiger had its share of problems .
It suffered mechanically with many breakdowns and had poor maneuverability .
Many roads and especially bridges were not suitable for a tank this size and the fuel requirements was enormous .
Many were abandoned due to lack of fuel rather then being destroyed during the offensive in the Ardennes .
Production also suffered with the bombing of the Henschel factory and there simply were n’t enough of these around .
The King Tiger was a case of too late and too few in number to make a difference in the outcome of the war .
However , the great firepower and armor of the King Tiger created the impression of a powerful armored force with almost invulnerable tanks .
Able to destroy enemy tanks at extreme ranges and impervious to those same tanks made the King Tiger more than a match for any allied tank .
Indeed for the allied forces , the sight of a King Tiger on the battlefield was terrifying and did great physical and morale damage to the enemy .
This fame and almost mystical fascination helped it earn its reputation as the most feared weapon of world war 2 .
For the German forces , it was the hallmark of German armored might and restored morale even in the last days of the war .
Due to the havoc it wreaked during the Ardennes offensive , the allies advancing into Berlin would fear the King Tiger up to the very last day of the war .

This particular tank # 213 on display outside the La Gleize Museum was one of the six left behind by Kampfgruppe Peiper during the Ardennes offensive .
It was part of the 501st Abteilung , commanded by Dollinger and was abandoned in front of the town hall .
Most of those left behind in the Ardennes had either ran out of fuel or broken down rather than destroyed .
In La Gleize one of the captured tanks was used as target practice by US troops once the village had been retaken .
They fired bazooka after bazooka round at it - none penetrated !!
This one was restored some years ago , the main gun being damaged .
It was repainted , but the original tank number , ' 213 ' was kept .
It was moved to its present site in 1951 .

This release restores keyfile support for non-crypto mounts .
A new cryptmount library is shipped that contains the code shared among pam_mount and its utilities .
libmount from util - linux 2.20 is now utilized in part as well .
In this release , pam_mount starts making use of the helper= option available in util - linux >= 2.20 so that umounting crypto mounts should work through just the umount ( 8 ) program .
A crash in ehd_log was fixed as well .
pam_mount is a Pluggable Authentication Module that can mount volumes for a user session
This module is aimed at environments with central file servers that a user wishes to mount on login and unmount on logout , such as ( semi - ) diskless stations where many users can logon and where statically mounting the entire / home from a server is a security risk , or listing all possible volumes in /etc / fstab is not feasible .
Users can define their own list of volumes without having to change ( possibly non-writable ) global config files .
Single sign - on feature — the user needs to type the password just once
Transparent mount process
No stored passwords
Volumes are unmounted on logout , freeing system resources and not leaving data exposed .
The module also supports mounting local filesystems of any kind the normal mount utility supports , with extra code to make sure certain volumes are set up properly because often they need more than just a mount call , such as encrypted volumes .
This includes SMB / CIFS , NCP , FUSE , dm - crypt and LUKS .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Time magazine has a nice problem :
It can choose between two compelling newsmakers as its 2008 Person of the Year .
When it announces the winner next month , will Time opt for Barack Obama or Sarah Palin ?
Of course , these are n't the only contenders , by any means .
But Time Warner 's TWX , Time has been known to zig while the country zags .
The magazine may select someone who does n't have a link to the just - concluded presidential campaign .
Time likes to make off - the - wall choices , in an effort to look controversial and manufacture publicity , such as Vladimir Putin , the prime minister of Russia , a year ago and " You " two years ago .
" You " was a nod to the raging popularity of social - network Web sites and the empowerment of individuals in a digital world .
At the time , I thought the pick was as dumb as dust and said so in print .
I subsequently saw the wisdom and recanted my criticism , to Time 's satisfaction .
Obamamania vs. Palinmania
Does
Time have the nerve to go out on a limb and select Palin over the obvious pick , President - elect Barack Obama ?
Sure , Obama revolutionized and electrified the political scene , becoming the first African - American to win the U.S. presidential election .
Further , he accomplished a far - reaching goal .
He made politics seem accessible and relevant to a nation of disenfranchised Americans , including generations of African - Americans .
That 's no small feat in itself .
Palin as Time 's Person of the Year
Then again , Palin , the oft - mocked governor of Alaska , achieved something remarkable in her own right .
She showed it was possible for ( truly ) anyone to rise to political prominence on the national stage , whether she strikes you today as an inspiration or a punch line .
Palin 's overnight fame seemed even more unlikely than that of Obama , who had followed a carefully scripted game plan designed to capitalize on the disillusionment over such better - known and seasoned rivals as Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
By contrast , Palin emerged as the accidental celebrity of politics .
Remember , only a handful of political junkies outside of Alaska knew much about Palin as recently as Aug. 28 .
Then , 24 hours later , John McCain tapped her to be his running mate and unwittingly unleashed Palinmania .
McCain was the presidential candidate on the Republican ticket -- but was there ever any doubt about which one was driving the media train ?
It was Palin .
Picking Palin
I hope Time selects Palin for these reasons :
Palin , even more than Obama , made politics seem exciting every day .
Obama , presumably , will get many opportunities to be named a Person of the Year during the years he occupies the White House ( particularly if and when he leads America out of Iraq and helps us achieve economic prosperity ) .
It would be fun to watch so many Americans go nuts because Time , once again , chose someone unexpected .
No doubt , plenty of jaded readers will ask , who cares ?
It 's a fair point but , ultimately , a short - sighted one .
Yes , the relevance of weekly news magazines has receded dramatically during the digital era .
Still , Time 's Person of the Year is probably the only end - of - the - year award that matters anymore .
Jim Kelly , the former
Time managing editor who now holds the same title at publisher Time Inc. is fond of calling the Person of the Year speculation " America 's favorite parlor game " -- and he is correct .
If nothing else , it is entertaining to make a pick , like with the nation 's preoccupation with holding Oscar pools every year .
There 's nothing wrong with lightening up a little now and then .
MEDIA WEB QUESTION OF THE DAY : Who should be Time 's Person of the Year ?
( and I hope that any sourpuss who snidely replies " who cares ! " gets a lump of coal in his or her Christmas stocking ) .

THE MIKE WALLACE INTERVIEW
Guest : Aldous Huxley
5/18/58
Part 1 Part 2 Part 3
WALLACE : This is Aldous Huxley , a man haunted by a vision of hell on earth .
A searing social critic , Mr. Huxley 27 years ago , wrote Brave New World , a novel that predicted that some day the entire world would live under a frightful dictatorship .
Today Mr. Huxley says that his fictional world of horror is probably just around the corner for all of us .
We ’ll find out why , in a moment .
( OPENING CREDITS )
WALLACE : Good evening , I ’m Mike Wallace .
Tonight ’s guest , Aldous Huxley , is a man of letters , as disturbing as he is distinguished .
Born in England , now a resident of California , Mr. Huxley has written some of the most electric novels and social criticism of this century .
He ’s just finished a series of essays called “ Enemies of Freedom , ” in which he outlines and defines some of the threats to our freedom in the United States ; and Mr. Huxley , right of the bat , let me ask you this : as you see it , who and what are the enemies of freedom here in the United States ?
HUXLEY : Well , I do n’t think you can say who in the United States , I do n’t think there are any sinister persons deliberately trying to rob people of their freedom , but I do think , first of all , that there are a number of impersonal forces which are pushing in the direction of less and less freedom , and I also think that there are a number of technological devices which anybody who wishes to use can use to accelerate this process of going away from freedom , of imposing control .
WALLACE : Well , what are these forces and these devices , Mr. Huxley ?
HUXLEY : I should say that there are two main impersonal forces , er… the first of them is not exceedingly important in the United States at the present time , though very important in other countries .
This is the force which in general terms can be called overpopulation , the mounting pressure of population pressing upon existing resources .
WALLACE : Uh-huh .
HUXLEY : Uh… this , of course , is an extraordinary thing ; something is happening which has never happened in the world ’s history before , I mean , let ’s just take a simple fact that between the time of birth of Christ and the landing of the May Flower , the population of the earth doubled .
It rose from two hundred and fifty million to probably five hundred million .
Today , the population of the earth is rising at such a rate that it will double in half a century .
WALLACE : Well , why should overpopulation work to diminish our freedoms ?
HUXLEY : Well , in a number of ways .
I mean , the… the experts in the field like Harrison Brown , for example , pointed out that in the underdeveloped countries actually the standard of living is at present falling .
The people have less to eat and less goods per capita than they had fifty years ago ;
and as the position of these countries , the economic position , becomes more and more precarious , obviously the central government has to take over more and more responsibility for keeping the ship - of - state on an even keel , and then of course you are likely to get social unrest under such conditions , with again an intervention of the central government .
So that , I think that one sees here a pattern which seems to be pushing very strongly towards a totalitarian regime .
And unfortunately , as in all these underdeveloped countries the only highly organized political party is the Communist Party , it looks rather as though they will be the heirs to this unfortunate process , that they will step into the power … the position of power .
WALLACE : Well then , ironically enough one of the greatest forces against communism in the world , the Catholic Church , according to your thesis would seem to be pushing us directly into the hands of the communists because they are against birth control .
HUXLEY : Well , I think this strange paradox probably is true .
There is , er… , it ’s an extraordinary situation actually .
I mean , one has to look at it , of course , from a biological point of view : the whole essence of biological life on earth is a question of balance and what we ’ve done is to practice death control in the most intensive manner without balancing this with birth control at the other end .
Consequently , the birth rates remain as high as they were and death rates have fallen substantially .
( COUGHS )
WALLACE : All right then , so much , for the time being anyway , for overpopulation .
Another force that is diminishing our freedoms ?
HUXLEY : Well another force which I think is very strongly operative in this country is the force of what may be called of overorganization .
Er…
As technology becomes more and more complicated , it becomes necessary to have more and more elaborate organizations , more hierarchical organizations , and incidentally the advance of technology is being accompanied by an advance in the science of organization .
It ’s now possible to make organizations on a larger scale than it was ever possible before , and so that you have more and more people living their lives out as subordinates in these hierarchical systems controlled by bureaucracy , either the bureaucracies of big businesses or the bureaucracies of big government .
WALLACE : Uh -huh .
Uh -huh .
Now the devices that you were talking about , are there specific devices or er… methods of communication which diminish our freedoms in addition to overpopulation and overorganization ?
HUXLEY : Well , there are certainly devices which can be used in this way .
I mean , let us er… take after all , a piece of very recent and very painful history is the propaganda used by Hitler , which was incredibly effective .
I mean , what were Hitler ’s methods ?
Hitler used terror on the one kind , brute force on the one hand , but he also used a very efficient form of propaganda , which er… he was using every modern device at that time .
He did n’t have TV. , but he had the radio which he used to the fullest extent , and was able to impose his will on an immense mass of people .
I mean , the Germans were a highly educated people .
WALLACE : Well , we ’re aware of all this , but how do we equate Hitler ’s use of propaganda with the way that propaganda , if you will , is used let us say here in the United States .
Are you suggesting that there is a parallel ?
HUXLEY : Needless to say it is not being used this way now , but , er… the point is , it seems to me , that there are methods at present available , methods superior in some respects to Hitler ’s method , which could be used in a bad situation .
I mean , what I feel very strongly is that we must n’t be caught by surprise by our own advancing technology .
This has happened again and again in history with technology ’s advance and this changes social condition , and suddenly people have found themselves in a situation which they did n’t foresee and doing all sorts of things they really did n’t want to do .
WALLACE : And well , what … what do you mean ?
Do you mean that we develop our television but we do n’t know how to use it correctly , is that the point that you ’re making ?
HUXLEY : Well , at the present the television , I think , is being used quite harmlessly ; it ’s being used , I think , I would feel , it ’s being used too much to distract everybody all the time .
But , I mean , imagine which must be the situation in all communist countries where the television , where it exists , is always saying the same things the whole time ; it ’s always driving along .
It ’s not creating a wide front of distraction it ’s creating a one - pointed , er… drumming in of a single idea , all the time .
It ’s obviously an immensely powerful instrument .
WALLACE : Uh-huh .
So you ’re talking about the potential misuse of the instrument .
HUXLEY : Exactly .
We have , of course … all technology is in itself moral and neutral .
These are just powers which can either be used well or ill ; it is the same thing with atomic energy , we can either use it to blow ourselves up or we can use it as a substitute for the coal and the oil which are running out .
WALLACE : You ’ve even written about the use of drugs in this light .
HUXLEY : Well now , this is a very interesting subject .
I mean , in this book that you mentioned , this book of mine , “ Brave New World , ” er… I postulated it a substance called ‘ soma , ’ which was a very versatile drug .
It would make people feel happy in small doses , it would make them see visions in medium doses , and it would send them to sleep in large doses .
Well , I do n’t think such a drug exists now , nor do I think it will ever exist .
But we do have drugs which will do some of these things , and I think it ’s quite on the cards that we may have drugs which will profoundly change our mental states without doing us any harm .
I mean , this is the… the pharmacological revolution which is taking place , that we have now powerful mind - changing drugs which physiologically speaking are almost costless .
I mean they are not like opium or like coca … cocaine , which do change the state of mind but leave terrible results physiologically and morally .
WALLACE : Mr. Huxley , in your new essays you state that these various “ Enemies of Freedom ” are pushing us to a real - life “ Brave New World , ” and you say that it ’s awaiting us just around the corner .
First of all , can you detail for us , what life in this Brave New World would you fear so much , or what life might be like ?
HUXLEY : Well , to start with , I think this kind of dictatorship of the future , I think will be very unlike the dictatorships which we ’ve been familiar with in the immediate past .
I mean , take another book prophesying the future , which was a very remarkable book , George Orwell ’s “ 1984 . ”
Well , this book was written at the height of the Stalinist regime , and just after the Hitler regime , and there he foresaw a dictatorship using entirely the methods of terror , the methods of physical violence .
Now , I think what is going to happen in the future is that dictators will find , as the old saying goes , that you can do everything with bayonets except sit on them !
WALLACE : ( LAUGHS )
HUXLEY : But , if you want to preserve your power indefinitely , you have to get the consent of the ruled , and this they will do partly by drugs as I foresaw in “ Brave New World , ” partly by these new techniques of propaganda .
They will do it by bypassing the sort of rational side of man and appealing to his subconscious and his deeper emotions , and his physiology even , and so , making him actually love his slavery .
I mean , I think , this is the danger that actually people may be , in some ways , happy under the new regime , but that they will be happy in situations where they ought n’t to be happy .
WALLACE : Well , let me ask you this .
You ’re talking about a world that could take place within the confines of a totalitarian state .
Let ’s become more immediate , more urgent about it .
We believe , anyway , that we live in democracy here in the United States .
Do you believe that this Brave New World that you talk about , er… could , let ’s say in the next quarter century , the next century , could come here to our shores ?
HUXLEY : I think it could .
I mean , er… that ’s why I feel it so extremely important here and now , to start thinking about these problems .
Not to let ourselves be taken by surprise by the… the new advances in technology .
I mean the… for example , in the regard to the use of the… of the drugs .
We know , there is enough evidence now for us to be able , on the basis of this evidence and using certain amount of creative imagination , to foresee the kind of uses which could be made by people of bad will with these things and to attempt to forestall this , and in the same way ,
I think with these other methods of propaganda we can foresee and we can do a good deal to forestall .
I mean , after all , the price of freedom is eternal vigilance .
WALLACE : You write in Enemies of Freedom , you write specifically about the United States .
You say this , writing about American political campaigns you say , “ All that is needed is money and a candidate who can be coached to look sincere ; political principles and plans for specific action have come to lose most of their importance .
The personality of the candidate , the way he is projected by the advertising experts , are the things that really matter . ”
HUXLEY : Well , this is the… during the last campaign , there was a great deal of this kind of statement by the advertising managers of the campaign parties .
This idea that the candidates had to be merchandised as though they were so - called two - faced and that you had to depend entirely on the personality .
I mean , personality is important , but there are certainly people with an extremely amiable personality , particularly on TV , who might not necessarily be very good in political … positions of political trust .
WALLACE : Well , do you feel that men like Eisenhower , Stevenson , Nixon , with knowledge aforethought were trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the American public ?
HUXLEY : No , but they were being advised by powerful advertising agencies who were making campaigns of a quite different kind from what had been made before .
and I think we shall see probably , er… all kinds of new devices coming into the picture .
I mean , for example , this thing which got a good deal of publicity last autumn , subliminal projection .
I mean , as it stands , this thing , I think is of no menace to us at the moment , but I was talking the other day to one of the people who has done most experimental work in the… psychological laboratory with this , was saying precisely this , that it is not at the moment a danger , but once you ’ve established the principle that something works , you can be absolutely sure that the technology of it is going to improve steadily .
And I mean his view of the subject was that , well , maybe they will use it up to some extent in the 1960 campaign , but they will probably use it a good deal and much more effectively in the 1964 campaign because this is the kind of rate at which technology advances .
WALLACE : And we ’ll be persuaded to vote for a candidate that we do not know that we are being persuaded to vote for .
HUXLEY : Exactly , I mean this is the rather alarming picture that you ’re being persuaded below the level of choice and reason .
WALLACE : In regard to advertising , which you mentioned just a little ago , in your writing , particularly in “ Enemies of Freedom , ” you attack Madison Avenue , which controls most of our television and radio advertising , newspaper advertising and so forth .
Why do you consistently attack the advertising agencies …
HUXLEY : Well , no I… I think that , er… advertisement plays a very necessary role , but the danger it seems to me in a democracy is this …
I mean what does a democracy depend on ?
A democracy depends on the individual voter making an intelligent and rational choice for what he regards as his enlightened self - interest , in any given circumstance .
But what these people are doing , I mean what both , for their particular purposes , for selling goods and the dictatorial propagandists are for doing , is to try to bypass the rational side of man and to appeal directly to these unconscious forces below the surfaces so that you are , in a way , making nonsense of the whole democratic procedure , which is based on conscious choice on rational ground .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
WALLACE : Of course , well , maybe …
I… you have just answered this next question because in your essay you write about television commercials , not just political commercials , but television commercials as such and how , as you put it , “ Today ’s children walk around singing beer commercials and toothpaste commercials . ”
And then you link this phenomenon in some way with the dangers of a dictatorship .
Now , could you spell out the connection or , have … or do you feel you ’ve done so sufficiently ?
HUXLEY : Well , I mean , here , this whole question of children , I think , is a terribly important one because children are quite clearly much more suggestible than the average grownup ; and again , suppose that , er… that for one reason or another all the propaganda was in the hands of one or very few agencies , you would have an extraordinarily powerful force playing on these children , who after all are going to grow up and be adults quite soon .
I do think that this is not an immediate threat , but it remains a possible threat , and …
WALLACE : You said something to the effect in your essay that the children of Europe used to be called ‘ cannon fodder ’ and here in the United States they are ‘ television and radio fodder . ’
HUXLEY : Well , after all , you can read in the trade journals the most lyrical accounts of how necessary it is , to get hold of the children because then they will be loyal brand buyers later on .
But I mean , again you just translate this into political terms , the dictator says they all will be ideology buyers when they are grownup .
WALLACE : We hear so much about brainwashing as used by the communists .
Do you see any brainwashing other than that which we ’ve just been talking about , that is used here in the United States , other forms of brainwashing ?
HUXLEY : Not in the form that has been used in China and in Russia because this is , essentially , the application of propaganda methods , the most violent kind to individuals ; it is not a shotgun method , like the… the advertising method .
It ’s a way of getting hold of the person and playing both on his physiology and his psychology until he really breaks down and then you can implant a new idea in his head .
I mean the descriptions of the methods are really blood curdling when you read them , and not only methods applied to political prisoners but the methods applied , for example , to the training of the young communist administrators and missionaries .
They receive an incredibly tough kind of training which may cause maybe twenty - five percent of them to break down or commit suicide , but produces seventy - five percent of completely one - pointed fanatics .
WALLACE : The question , of course , that keeps coming back to my mind is this : obviously politics in themselves are not evil , television is not in itself evil , atomic energy is not evil , and yet you seem to fear that it will be used in an evil way .
Why is it that the right people will not , in your estimation , use them ?
Why is it that the wrong people will use these various devices and for the wrong motives ?
HUXLEY : Well , I think one of the reasons is that these are all instruments for obtaining power , and obviously the passion for power is one of the most moving passions that exists in man ; and after all , all democracies are based on the proposition that power is very dangerous and that it is extremely important not to let any one man or any one small group have too much power for too long a time .
After all what are the British and American Constitution except devices for limiting power , and all these new devices are extremely efficient instruments for the imposition of power by small groups over larger masses .
WALLACE : Well , you ask this question yourself in “ Enemies of Freedom . ”
I ’ll put your own question back to you .
You ask this , “ In an age of accelerating overpopulation , of accelerating overorganization , and ever more efficient means of mass communication , how can we preserve the integrity and reassert the value of the human individual ? ”
You put the question , now here ’s your chance to answer it Mr. Huxley .
HUXLEY : Well , this is obviously … first of all , it is a question of education .
Er… I think it ’s terribly important to insist on individual values , I mean , what is a… there is a tendency as a… you probably read a book by Whyte , “ The Organization Man ” , a very interesting , valuable book I think , where he speaks about the new type of group morality , group ethic , which speaks about the group as though the group were somehow more important than the individual .
But this seems , as far as I ’m concerned , to be in contradiction with what we know about the genetical makeup of human beings , that every human being is unique .
And it is , of course , on this genetical basis that the whole idea of the value of freedom is based .
And I think it ’s extremely important for us to stress this in all our educational life , and I would say it ’s also very important to teach people to be on their guard against the sort of verbal booby traps into which they are always being led , to analyze the kind of things that are said to them .
Well , I think there is this whole educational side of … and I think there are many more things that one could do to strengthen people , and to make them more aware of what ’s being done .
WALLACE : You ’re a prophet of decentralization ?
HUXLEY : Well , the… yes … if it … it ’s feasible .
It ’s one of the tragedies , it seems to me .
I mean , many people have been talking about the importance of decentralization in order to give back to the voter a sense of direct power .
I mean … the voter in an enormous electorate field is quite impotent , and his vote seems to count for nothing .
This is not true where the electorate is small , and where he is dealing with a… with a group which he can manage and understand … and if one can , as Jefferson after all suggested , break up the units , er… into smaller and smaller units and so , get a real , self - governing democracy .
WALLACE : Well , that was all very well in Jefferson ’s day , but how can we revamp our economic system and decentralize , and at the same time meet militarily and economically the tough challenge of a country like Soviet Russia ?
HUXLEY : Well , I think the answer to that is that there are … it seems to me that you … that production , industrial production is of two kinds .
I mean , there are some kinds of industrial production which obviously need the most tremendously high centralization , like the making of automobiles for example .
But there are many other kinds where you could decentralize quite easily and probably quite economically , and that you would then have this kind of decentralized , like after all you begin to see it now , if you travel through the south , this decentralized textile industry which is springing up there .
WALLACE : Mr. Huxley , let me ask you this , quite seriously , is freedom necessary ?
HUXLEY : As far as I am concerned it is .
WALLACE : Why ?
Is it necessary for a productive society ?
HUXLEY : Yes , I should say it is .
I mean , a genuinely productive society .
I mean you could produce plenty of goods without much freedom , but I think the whole sort of creative life of man is ultimately impossible without a considerable measure of individual freedom , of initiative , creation , all these things which we value , and I think value properly , are impossible without a large measure of freedom .
WALLACE : Well , Mr. Huxley , take a look again at the country which is in the stance of our opponent anyway , it would seem , anyway it would seem to be there , Soviet Russia .
It is strong , and getting stronger , economically , militarily , at the same time it ’s developing its art forms pretty well , er… it seems not unnecessarily to squelch the creative urge among its people .
And yet it is not a free society .
HUXLEY : It ’s not a free society , but here is something very interesting that those members of the society , like the scientists , who are doing the creative work , are given far more freedom than anybody else .
I mean , it is a privileged aristocratic society in which , provided they do n’t poke their noses into political affairs , these people are given a great deal of prestige , a considerable amount of freedom , and a lot money .
I mean , this is a very interesting fact about the new Soviet regime , and I think what we are going to see is er… a people on the whole with very little freedom but with an oligarchy on top enjoying a considerable measure of freedom and a very high standard of living .
WALLACE : And the people down below , the ‘ epsilons ’ down below …
HUXLEY : Enjoying very little .
WALLACE : And you think that that kind of situation can long endure ?
HUXLEY : I think it can certainly endure much longer than the situation in which everybody is kept out ; I mean , they can certainly get their technological and scientific results on such a basis .
WALLACE : Well , the next time that I talk to you then , perhaps we should investigate further the possibility of the establishment of that kind of a society , where the drones work for the queen bees up above .
HUXLEY : Well , but yes , but I must say , I still believe in democracy , if we can make the best of the creative activities of the people on top plus those of the people on the bottom , so much the better .
WALLACE : Mr. Huxley , I surely thank you for spending this half hour with us , and I wish you God speed sir .
HUXLEY : Thank you .
WALLACE : Aldous Huxley finds himself these days in a peculiar and disturbing position : a quarter of a century after prophesying an authoritarian state in which people were reduced to cyphers , he can point at Soviet Russia and say , “ I told you so ! ”
The crucial question , as he sees it now , is whether the so - called Free World is shortly going to give Mr. Huxley the further dubious satisfaction of saying the same thing about us .
Stay tuned for a preview of next weeks interview .
Till then , Mike Wallace .
Good night .

Today , scientists understand pretty well how life evolves , by mechanisms based on Darwin ’s theory of natural selection for survival of the fittest .
However , Darwin ’s 1859 classic ,
On the Origin of Species , somewhat ironically does n’t answer that very question – how species actually originated .
And to this day , how that first tiny pool of chemicals twitched to life remains a puzzle .
In a recent study called “ Why did life emerge ? ” , two scientists , son and father Arto Annila of the University of Helsinki and Erkki Annila of the Finnish Forest Research Institute , offer some insight into the general driving force of life ’s origins in terms of thermodynamics .
As they explain , all organisms are composed of molecules that assemble together via numerous chemical reactions .
Just as heat flows from hot to cold , these molecules obey the universal tendency to diminish energy differences , so that the most likely chemical reactions are those in which energy flows “ downhill ” toward a stationary state , or chemical equilibrium .
Although the researchers do n’t speculate on the specific chemical reactions that created life , they explain that the molecules involved most likely underwent a series of more and more complex reactions to minimize mutual energy differences between matter on Earth and with respect to high - energy radiation from Sun .
The process eventually advanced so far that it cumulated into such sophisticated functional structures that could be called living .
“ The most important idea in our study is that there is no distinction between animate and inanimate , ” Arto Annila told PhysOrg.com .
“ Processes of life are , in their principles , no different from any other natural processes . ”
In their study , which is published in the International Journal of Astrobiology , the researchers considered a primordial pool that contained some basic compounds .
By reacting with one another and coupling with an external energy source such as the Sun , the compounds formed a chemical system .
The compounds continually engaged in chemical reactions , thriving the most when capturing and distributing more and more of the Sun ’s energy in the quest for a steady state .
The evolutionary process was and still is non-deterministic , even chaotic , since the energy flows create energy differences that in turn affect the flows .
Due to random variations stemming from the chemical reactions , some novel compounds may have emerged in the primordial system .
Some of these compounds ( such as those involving carbon ) might have been exceptionally good at creating energy flow , enabling the system to diminish energy differences very efficiently and reach a higher level of entropy .
Compounds with these advantages would have gained ground during this period of primitive chemical evolution .
But the scientists emphasize that identifying which exact compounds were key players during this period would be very difficult to determine .
“ Today we may have only very little evidence left from the courses in the very distant past to deduce which chemical species went extinct , while others , more viable in energy transduction , emerged , ” Arto Annila explained .
In other words , this study focuses on why life emerged , not how .
What is more relevant , the scientists note , is the fact that the physical tendency to diminish energy differences makes no distinction between systems that are inanimate or animate .
As the researchers explain , the order and complexity that characterize modern biological systems have no value in and of themselves , but structure and hierarchical organization emerged and developed because they provided paths for increasing energy flows .
The scientists give several examples of mechanisms associated with life that increase entropy .
For instance , when systems ( e.g. molecules ) become entities of larger systems ( e.g. cells ) that participate in larger ranges of interactions to consume more free energy , entropy increases .
Genetic code might have served as another primordial mechanism , acting as a catalyst that could increase energy flow toward greater entropy .
Today , complex organisms have cellular metabolism , which is another mechanism that increases entropy , as it disperses energy throughout the organism and into the environment .
The food chain in an ecosystem is another example of a mechanism for transferring energy on a larger scale .
In this sense , life is a very natural thing , which emerged simply to satisfy basic physical laws .
Our “ purpose , ” so to speak , is to redistribute energy on the Earth , which is in between a huge potential energy difference caused by the hot Sun and cold space .
Organisms evolve via natural selection , but at the most basic level , natural selection is driven by the same thermodynamic principle : increasing entropy and decreasing energy differences .
The natural processes from which life emerged , then , are the same processes that keep life going – and they operate on all timescales .
“ According to thermodynamics , there was no striking moment or no single specific locus for life to originate , but the natural process has been advancing by a long sequence of steps via numerous mechanisms so far reaching a specific meaning – life , ” the researchers explained .
And because thermodynamics recognizes no specific moment , particular place , compound or reaction that would distinguish animate from inanimate , a search for ‘ the birth of life ’ seems like an ill - posed project , Arto Annila explained .
“ Indeed , the quest for the origin of life seems a futile endeavor because life in its entirety is a natural process that has , according to the second law of thermodynamics , no definite beginning , ” he said .
“ To ask how life started would be the same as to ask when and where did the first wind blow that quivered the surface of a warm pond . ”

For me , Little Ashes is first and foremost a love story , moving and tender .
This is a forbidden love between two men that moves from a silent , aching longing to one incandescent and glorious moment of promise , only to end in rejection and disillusionment .
García Lorca ’s love for Dalí gives the movie its shape , its dramatic spine .
This is first and foremost an actor ’s movie , truthful and beautiful , intimate and spare .
The performances dominate .
This is also a film about integrity .
Encouraged by Magdalena , García Lorca keeps faith with his beliefs , his roots , his work and , eventually , his sexuality .
Dalí chooses notoriety and success and a fantastic kind of elitism over deeper values .
These are universal themes , which a wide audience can understand and identify with .
This is a film about artists but not a film about art .
The film vibrates with the fun and humor and anarchic excitement of their early lives and moves with them to a deep kind of knowledge , despair , beauty and eventually death ; yet a legacy that lives on .
The ending should not be without hope , for we know their art lives on .
The film is not a conventional period drama .
The issues these men were confronting are incontestably modern .
In the midst of the repression and political unrest of pre-Spanish Civil War , eccentric artist Salvador Dalí and renowned poet and revolutionary Federico García Lorca find their artistic and sexual freedom in each other .
The two form a bond challenged by their fierce ambitions , the struggle between a love for Spain and a love for each other .
, ” romantic story about the young life and loves of artist , filmmakerand writeris directed byfrom a script byPaul Morrison ’s first feature film , “ ” was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.said Paul Morrison .
“ Little Ashes ” was written by Philippa Goslett with colleague .
“ Little Ashes ” is Goslett ’s first screenplay .
She is currently writing “ ” for BAFTA award - winning director .
Goslett is also working on “ ” ( “ “ ) and “ ” for “ Little Ashes ” starsand .
No official release date has been set for “ Little Ashes , ” but we can expect it to see it play in limited theaters during the first - half of 2009 .
The film ’s
Web site promises that it will come to select theaters in 2009 and that it is rated R for “ sexual content , language and a brief disturbing image . ”
Clearly , Pattinson ’s “ Twilight ” follow - up will be a long way from Stephenie Meyer ’s best - selling young - adult novels , but his loyal fans are already eager to see if he will once again dazzle them .

ローヤルゼリーの疲労回復効果
なかなかとれない疲労に悩まされている方も多いのではないでしょうか？疲労の多くは、体内の栄養不足が原因です。ローヤルゼリーには40種類以上の豊富が栄養素が含まれ、様々な疲労の原因に効果的に働きかけてくれます。
そのローヤルゼリーの効果とはどんなものなのか、みていきましょう。
そもそも疲労とは ？
疲れを自覚する症状として、身体にだるさを感じたり、頭がぼーっとするなどがありますが、疲労には定義があり、作業能率が低下した状態とされています。
具体的な例を挙げると、
刺激に対する反応が鈍感になる
思考力が低下して、注意力が散漫になる
動作が鈍くなり、行動量が低下する
など、普段の実力を出しきれないほどの変化があらわれたとき、疲労状態にあるといえるでしょう。
自分でできる疲労回復方法とは
睡眠・休 息
疲れを感じているときは、無理せず身体を休めてあげましょう。特に心身ともに休息できる睡眠は、疲労回復に最も重要な役割を果たします。
睡眠中は成長ホルモンが分泌され、細胞の新陳代謝を促す大切な時間です。日中は脳と身体の細胞が疲労によってダメージを受けています。修復が行われなければ疲労は蓄積され、慢性疲労の原因にもなってしまいます。
日中に眠気を感じない充分な睡眠をとりましょう。一般的に6～8時間の睡眠が理想とされています。
食事で栄養バランスを整える
疲労を感じているときは、食事の栄養バランスを見直してみましょう。私たちの身体は、普段の食事から栄養素を摂りエネルギーを生み出しています。このエネルギーが不足すると、疲労が回復されずに蓄積されていってしまうのです。
特にエネルギー生成を助けるビタミンやミネラルは、体内では作り出せない栄養素なので、不足しないように補給していくことが大切です。忙しくて食事を摂る時間がないときもあるでしょう。それでも、できるだけバランスのよい食事を心がけることで、疲労は徐々に回復されていきます。
ローヤルゼリーの疲労回復効果とは？
疲労回復には、タンパク質・炭水化物・脂質の3大栄養素と、これらを円滑に代謝させるビタミン・ミネラルの摂取が重要です。ローヤルゼリーにはこれらの5大栄養素が含まれ、様々な疲労に対処することができます。
ビタミン
ローヤルゼリーはビタミンが豊富です。特に他の栄養素の代謝に関わるビタミンB群が多く、効率よく疲労を回復してくれます。
エネルギーの60％は糖質から作り出すのが理想とされています。ビタミンB1は糖質の代謝を促し、疲労回復に必要なエネルギーを作り出します。
疲労時は消化器系の働きも衰えたり、食欲が低下を招きます。ビタミンB2は粘膜を保護する働きがあるので、胃腸の粘膜を守り、食欲改善や栄養素の消化・吸収を高めてくれます。
日本人は全てのビタミンが不足傾向にあり、特にビタミンB1は全年代で不足するとしているとされています。その理由として、ビタミンB群は食事だけでは不足しやすく、また水溶性なので身体から失われていきやすい特徴が影響していることが挙げられます。
また、ビタミンはバランスよく摂取することで、それぞれの効果を最大限に発揮するという特徴も持っています。ローヤルゼリーにはB群以外のビタミンも豊富に含まれているので、疲労回復に効率よく作用してくれます。
ミネラル
疲労は栄養素の不足が原因になる場合もあります。特に鉄分の不足は女性に多く、貧血の症状でも疲れを感じます。
鉄分は赤血球のヘモグロビンの原料として、血液中に存在しています。ヘモグロビンは血液を介して、体内に酸素を供給する役割を持っています。そのため、鉄分が不足するとヘモグロビンの生成ができず、身体は酸素が不足した状態になります。その結果として起きるのが貧血で、動悸や息切れの症状から疲労を感じやすくなります。
また、ミネラル全般の不足も疲労の原因になります。マグネシウムとカリウムは細胞の中に電解質の形で存在し、お互いに濃度を一定に保っています。身体が最も健全なコンディションでいられるのは、この電解質のバランスが維持されているときです。
ところが身体に疲労が溜まると、体内の栄養素は代謝を高めて、疲労回復のために働きます。このとき、ビタミンとともにミネラルも大量に消費されてしまいまいます。すると電解質のバランスが崩れ、身体に様々な不調を招く原因になってしまうのです。
疲労を感じているときは、体内のミネラルがどんどん失われています。ローヤルゼリーには、鉄分をはじめとしたミネラル成分も豊富に含まれています。継続して摂取することで、鉄分不足による疲労や、ミネラル不足が影響する疲労や体調不良も事前に予防することができるのです。
アミノ酸
アミノ酸はローヤルゼリーの成分
の中で最も多く、疲労回復の中心的な役割を果たしてくれます。
バリン・ロイシン・イソロイシンは、3つを総称してBCAAと呼ぶ必須アミノ酸です。筋肉の修復に作用するため、運動による疲労の回復を効率よく進めてくれます。
非必須アミノ酸のアルギニンは脳下垂体を刺激して、成長ホルモンの分泌を促し、細胞の修復を助けます。この作用によって、睡眠時の疲労回復効果が高まります。
また、BBCAとアルギニンは相性がよく、同時に摂取すると効率よくエネルギーを生み出し、疲労回復を早めてくれます。
筋肉に疲労が溜まると、疲労物質が蓄積されます。アスパラギン酸は疲労物質をエネルギーに変えるときのサポートとして作用し、疲労回復の促進に働きかけます。
これらを含む多くのアミノ酸が合成され、全身の細胞の原料となるタンパク質を作り出しています。疲労によって損なわれた細胞の修復には、質のよいタンパク質が欠かせません。
ローヤルゼリーには、体内では作り出せない9種類の必須アミノ酸に加え、15種類のアミノ酸が含まれています。優れたアミノ酸バランスで作り出されたタンパク質こそ、ローヤルゼリー最大の疲労回復効果を生み出しているのです。
疲労回復にはローヤルゼリーが効果的
疲労は毎日の生活の中で、誰もが感じてしまうものです。重要なのは疲労を溜め込まず、しっかりと身体を休めることです。
そのためには休息と睡眠が大切になりますが、栄養素が疲労回復を促進させてくれます。
疲れを感じたら、栄養豊富なローヤルゼリーを取り入れ、効率よく疲労を回復していきましょう。

Gallup Daily : Before Final Debate , Obama Leads by 7 McCain ’s 43 % matches his high over the past two weeks
PRINCETON , NJ --
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking report shows Barack Obama continuing to lead John McCain , now by seven percentage points among registered voters , 50 % to 43 % .
These results , based on Oct. 12 - 14 polling , represent a slightly better showing for McCain than has been the case in recent weeks .
His 43 % share of the vote matches his high over the past two weeks -- roughly covering the month of October to date -- due , in part , to a stronger showing in Tuesday night 's polling .
Obama 's 50 % support level matches his average for October to date .
Obama has held a statistically significant lead , as large as 11 points at times , over McCain among registered voters since just before the first presidential debate in late September .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
The candidates will engage in the final presidential debate of the campaign season tonight at Hofstra University in Hempstead , N.Y .
Likely Voter Estimates
Gallup is presenting two likely voter estimates to see how preferences might vary under different turnout scenarios .
The " expanded " model determines likely voters based only on their current voting intention .
This estimate would take into account higher turnout among groups of voters traditionally less likely to vote , but who may be inspired to vote this year .
That model has generally produced results that closely match the registered voter figures as is the case today , showing Obama up by eight points , 52 % to 44 % .
The " traditional " likely voter model , which Gallup has employed for past elections , factors in prior voting behavior as well as current voting intention .
This has generally shown a closer contest , though with Obama still ahead .
Today 's results show Obama with a three - point advantage over McCain using this likely voter model , 49 % to 46 % .
That is slightly closer than the average five - point advantage for Obama among traditional likely voters since Gallup began measuring them last week .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 12 - 14 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,785 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,160 " traditional " likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention and past voting behavior ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,319 more broadly defined likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention only ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Stranger than " Da Vinci code " and for real !
Jesus Christ was their ancestor , they keep His grave in Japan !
Author : Augustin Vidović
You can give feedback to this article in its dedicated online forum .
If you did ever read or hear of the best - seller " Da Vinci code " , you know its main topic : Jesus Christ lived after the cross , married , had children , and so on , and his descendants are still living nowadays ... but your are n't as likely to have heard of some remote village located in the northern regions of Japan , where since ancient times are located Jesus Christ 's tomb , his testament ( yes , He wrote His will , in Japanese ! ) , as well as his still living descendants !
This is the true story we are going to discuss in this article .
In a preliminary phase , we are going to enjoy our right to believe without restriction , while later we intend to apply a more critical approach to all the claims of this curious legend .
Pour yourself a nice cup of green tea , and enjoy the ride !
Part I , right to believe : A Village of Mystery In Japan , Aomori prefecture ( 青森 ) , between Lake Towada ( 十和田潮 ) and Hachinohe city ( 八戸 , more about this name later ) , lies a hardly 3000 souls strong village , Shingo ( 新郷 , literally " new village " , part of which was formerly known as Herai , 戸来 , which is still the name of the mountain in the eastern part of the village ) .
Apart from its especially delicious garlic and its renowned yoghurt factory , it would only have the astounding beauty of its nature , where can still be seen straw roofs on top of which grass is growing , to offer as a sightseeing attraction ... ...
If it was not for the fact that Shingo is also famous for being the place where Jesus Christ was buried !
You can still go there a visit His tomb , which is an official landmark , located on road signs , and every year , the Christ Festival ( キリスト祭 ) occurs , attracting a crowd of local performers and puzzled tourists .
Well , as an indication of its popularity , you certainly wo n't an amused grin out when you see the site entrance welcome panel , onto which can be seen , side by side , the cross representation and the trademark logo of some famous worldwide oversweetened soda .
Here is the legend , as can be read in tourist brochures or be told by people there :
When He was 21 years old , Jesus Christ ( イエスキリスト ) came to Japan and studied theology for 12 years .
He came back to Judea at the age of 33 in order to preach , but people there rejected His teachings and arrested Him to crucify Him .
However , it was His little brother Jsus Chri ( イスキリ ) who took His place and ended his life on the cross .
Jesus Christ , having escaped crucifixion , resumed
His travels and finally came back to Japan , where
He settled in this village , Herai , and lived till the age of 106 ( other versions mention the age of 118 and the name of His wife , Miyu ) .
In this holy place , the tomb on the right is dedicated to Jesus Christ , while the tomb on the left commemorates
His brother , Jsus Chri .
All of this is written in Jesus Christ 's testament .
The site of the tomb of Jesus Christ , which has now become a public park , complete with gardens , parking , fountains and even museum , is attracting every year some 10,000 visitors .
This represents a considerable income for this region , far - off main communication hubs .
In the photograph below , the cross - bearing lump of earth in the foreground is the tomb of Jesus Christ 's little brother , the one in the back being Jesus Christ 's tomb .
The main access stairs , carved out in the hill slope , open out on the right , between the two white wooden pillars .
Usually , in Japan , graves are marked with tombstones , onto which are generally written the names of those ( or , most often , their ashes ) who are buried .
However , exceptionally on can spot a burial mound , as it is the case for the Chri( st ) brothers .
That kind of grave is traditionally associated with very important figures .
These two mounds are not the only graves in that place : a few meters down the hill , there is a more " classical " graveyard , and among a number of other tombstones scattered on the hill side , lies the easily visible family tomb of the Sawaguchis , caretakers of this place since immemorial times .
Coincidence ?
I think not ! , answers the famous researcher Kyomaro Takeuchi ( 竹内巨麿 ) , who , in 1935 , in his family 's library in Ibaraki prefecture ( more in the south of the country ) unearthed some very ancient documents , thanks to which all this story could be restored .
According to these Takeuchi documents , the Sawaguchi family is none other than the equivalent of the Saint - Clairs in the Da Vinci code , but in the real world : they are Christ 's descendants .
The discovery of these documents did cause a lot of agitation in the japanese press , at that time , and a great many pieces of evidence , which had no importance when considered isolately , made sense all of a sudden and corroborated this assertion , as we are going to see .
By the way , you can see another kind of carved stones in the vicinity , which are not tomb stones , but Tanka ( 短歌 ) , short poems sung slowly in a melodious voice .
Those are there because of the Tanka contest taking place every year during the Christ Festival .
On the same hill is also located the Denshoukan , to which most of the tourists pay a visit .
In this museum are gathered historical documents and evidences of Christ 's presence , it therefore is an unescapable visit for whoever is interested in the legend .
It is nearly impossible to miss this 5 branches star , embly of the Sawaguchi family , in its prominent position :
Outside the hill , at a few dozen paces of the site entrance , you can see the original emblem , at the front of the Sawaguchi house , which is not a museum but a real house where are living people like you and me ( well , according to the Takeuchi documents , not exactly like you and me ) :
The similarity of this family emblem this David 's star , symbol of the hebrews since ancient times , is nothing short of breathtaking : Moreover , if this story was not absolutely certain then why would Israel 's ambassador have come in 2004 to donate the plaque shown below , carved with the following message in hebrew :
This plaque is a gift from the city of Jerusalem , as a token of friendship between the State of Israel , the city of Jerusalem and Shingo .
The plaque , laid on the floor between the two tombs , can be seen by everyone .
According to professor Eiji Kawamorita , an authority in hebraic culture , the lyrics of the traditional song chanted each year at the Christ Festival , while dancing around the tomb of Jesus Christ , the meaning of which being forgotten to everybody , would have originally been hebrew language .
For reference , these words are , in their most complete version ( given in the Shingo chronicle ) , pronounced as follows : Naniyaa dorayayo ( ナニヤアドラヤ ヨ )
Naniyaa donasare inokie ( ナニヤアドナサレイノキ エ )
Naniyaa doyarayo ( ナニヤアドラヤ ヨ )
It is a strange chanting , for more than one reason .
Besides the fact that its meaning was lost , this song , which is to be heard only in Shingo , has no ending , in opposition to the general rule .
And this nasare in the middle , does n't it sound a bit too much like " Nazareth " ?
But the orgy of evidence is not over yet !
Let 's take a look at the face of Mr. Sawaguchi 's father , on the photo below ; it 's very hard not to notice the obvious semitic characteristics !
The members of the Sawaguchi family are taller than average , their nose is longer than average , and lighter their skin complexion .
That alone takes them apart and betrays their probable origin .
Another element to add to our presumption is the stunning likeness of the traditional local costume to the typical hebrew outfit , as can be seen on the illustration below : Moreover , if we put two mere minutes of thought into it , the village name , Herai , derives much probably from the word " Hebrai " , since its inhabitants are of hebrew descent .
And what about that other peculiar ancestral local custom which consists in drawing a cross on newborns ' foreheads , custom blindly followed , which origin is long lost in the mist of times ?
On top of all this , here comes enough to sweep any remaining shadow of doubt out of the most skeptical rationalist , at this stage of the demonstration : the museum 's masterpiece , the testament of Jesus Christ , written by His own hand , naturally in japanese !
This testament was miraculously discovered in the famous Takeuchi documents .
Jesus Christ describes the tomb and signs with His name , without any possibility of misidentification : Let 's have a break : once you begin to recover from the shock of the exhibition , you can go to the museum shop , and eat a nice " Dracula " ice cream , which , in addition to being delicious ( Shingo garlic is not renowned for no reason ! ) , will turn vampires away .
The crucifix drawn on the lid will finish repelling any vampire still surviving after the garlic ( and a crucifix is right in the theme of the place ) !
You wo n't leave without this Chawan ( tea cup ) adorned with Nanya doyara song words :
At the end of the break , to bring back a souvenir , why not using this photo scenery , so convenient when you want to avoid hours of costuming ?
In the blink of an eye , here comes Jesus Christ and all His little family !
Part II : vigilance duty , When Tourism Office is in good terms with Archeomaniacs
In order to wake up our critical mind a little , nothing compares to one more mystery .
As a matter of fact , about 3 kilometers away from Jesus Christ 's grave , can be admired not one , but two pyramids !
The Big Stone God Pyramid ( 大石神ピラミッド ) , and , a few hundred meters on top of a lush hill , the Upper Big Stone God Pyramid ( 上大石神ピラミッド ) .
The first pyramid is worshipped like a god , because it is located at the center of its own Shinto sanctuary , in plain nature .
Shinto is the religion of nature , its gods are countless .
This sanctuary has been existing for centuries , suffering no pollution by archeomania ...
But this somewhat recent explanation board tells a different story : it claims that pyramids in Japan are more ancient than egyptian or mexican ones , and that some very old document , found in the archives of the Takeuchi family ( 武内 ) in Ibaraki prefecture in 1935 ( what a coincidence ! ) unveiled the existence of 7 pyramids in Japan .
The famous pyramid hunter Katsutoki Sakai ( 酒井勝軍 ) and the film - maker Banzan Toya ( 鳥谷播山 ) named that very same year the Big Stone God Pyramid " Number 4 pyramid of Japan " , etc .
This same board explains the discovery of Jesus ' tomb the same way .
Two pyramids " older than egyptian pyramids " and a tomb supposed to be less than 2000 years old , discovered by the same individuals , using the same " ancient documents " , that 's a little bit too much .
This smells , a hoax smell .
Well , at least now we 've got names .
Before we push our investigation further , let 's enjoy the fine weather and visit both " pyramids " ( both visits are recorded as videos on the DVD ) .
First , the one inside the sanctuary is composed of several big stones , each of those was given a name .
One of the stones is especially famous , it 's the mirror stone ( 鏡石 ) , because , as written on the accompanying panel , during a particulary strong earthquake , on 23rd july 1857 , it felt right on the side on which were carved ancient inscriptions ... talk about some misfortune !
The Upper Big Stone God Pyramid , in turn , does n't have its own dedicated sanctuary .
Well , to tell the truth , it ressembles much less a pyramid than a big stone on top of a hill .
According to its legend , in ancient times , a golden sphere was located inside one of its numerous crevices ... then again , what a lack of luck !
What about the relation between these pyramids and Jesus ' grave ?
We 've got their common " discovery " year , 1935 , a common source for " ancient " documents about them - the Takeuchi documents - and now the name of the intrepid explorers : Katsutoki Sakai and Banzan Toya .
We still need another name , but it wo n't be hard to find : the name of Shingo 's mayor , a that time , for to whom does the operation benefit , if not local tourism ?
The mayor at that time , as a matter of fact , Denjiro Sasaki ( 佐々木伝次郎 ) was known for his relentlessness in seeking to developing tourism in Shingo .
The year before , it had been decided to make Lake Towada a national reserve .
To Sasaki 's much despair , Shingo area had been excluded from the zone .
Thus Sasaki invited film - maker Toya , notoriously in love with Lake Towada , in order to have him make some publicity for Shingo .
But Toya 's fondness was only for the lake , as he looked down on the village .
However , Toya was also keen on fictious archeology , and brought with him his friend Sakai , who was already known at that time for his annoucement of the existence of seven pyramids in Japan .
Together , 5 months before , they had gone on a quest for the " First pyramid in Japan " , on Mount Hiba ( 比婆山ピラミッド ) .
And so they went to the Big Stone God sanctuary , of which they declared , with much hype in the press , that it was the " Second pyramid of Japan " .
In 1935 , everything seems in place , a single spark is needed for the fireworks to begin .
That spark happens to be a man named Kyomaro Takeuchi , posing as the heir of the Takeuchi family ( the family of the Documents ) , and also claiming to be an oracle .
He came to Shingo that year and met Sasaki .
One of his claims was that he had found inside the archives of his family ancient documents relating to events dating back to up to 317 billion years in the past ( stronger than Ron Hubbard ! ) and enjoyed a crowd of fantastic archeology loving followers .
On october 10th , after he left Shingo , the discovery of Jesus Christ 's tomb was announced .
By a strange coincidence , as soon as he came back home , Takeuchi digged up the testament of Jesus Christ from his archives !
The first Christ Festival , an addition to the folklore of the village and a serious boost to local tourism ( 10 % of the annual frequentation takes place on this single day ) , is celebrated some 30 years later .
It seems that it takes about one generation to implant a new myth .
The " Christ Festival " , recuring every year at the beginning of june , is in itself a traditional festival , starting with a Shinto ceremony , which altar is set up down the stairs to the burial mounds , a bon odori ( 盆踊り ) style dance - though the bon festival takes place in fact in august - and then goes on with a gathering of the locals to drink , eat , chat while looking at dances , songs , poems by those who prepared some ( a few sequences in video on the companion DVD ) .
The " Christ " part is the theme of the Shinto (! ) ceremony , the tomb of Jesus Christ is used as a set for the Nanya doyara , but the remaining of the festival has a life of its own ( it happens by the way in another location , where everybody is relocated once the Nanya doyara is over ) .
This is an indication that the " Christ " theme of the festival is a recent addition .
What about the weird words of Nanya doyara ?
After all , did n't professor Kawamorita , who is not a scammer , affirm its likely hebrew origin ?
Two things have to be pointed out : first of all , this dance is not specific to the Shingo village , it is spread across the prefectures of Aomori , Iwate and Akita .
It is exact that the meaning was lost , but that is hardly surprising , Japanese being a very diverse language , in some regions people speak sensibly differently from japanese spoken in Tokyo .
On the other hand , embarrassed by the fact that his name is associated with this story , professor Kawamorita , in his work Research on the hebrew song words in japan , holds this illuminating statement :
During the summer of 1935 , when I set foot in herai , the tomb of Christ did not exist yet [...]
I have nothing in common with Kyomaro Takeuchi , who posed as an oracle and a remote descendant of Sukune Takeuchi ( 武内宿禰 ) , and his group , Katsutoki Sakai , Banzan Toya , history researcher Kikue Yamakawa etc. who created that " Christ 's grave " fantasy in Herai , and I refuse to bear that responsibility .
But what becomes of the name " Herai " ?
Is n't it an alteration of " Hebrai " ?
Not at all .
In all this part of the Aomori prefecture , and south of it Iwate , extends a string of towns which names are composed of a number followed by the character " 戸 " ( door ) : 一戸 ( Ichinohe , " Door 1 " ) , 二戸 ( Ninohe , " Door 2 " ) , etc. up to 九戸 ( Kunohe , " Door 9 " ) .
The only exception being the absence of " Door 4 " , for " 4 " is an unlucky number in Japan - such a town 's name would be pronounced like " The door to death " .
The character " Door " comes from an old custom ; in all this region , the cattle was kept inside a common wooden enclosure .
Inhabitants , living " at the door " ( of the enclosure ) , were called " people of the wooden doors " .
Thus were composed the names of the villages .
In 861 , the 10th " door " was not named as such , because people had grown used to the " doors " being numbered from 1 to 9 .
Instead , the name " The door coming to 10 " was contracted in " The coming door " , or " Herai " ( 戸来 ) .
Of course , the story is outrageously shortened here , to the point of inaccuracy , but this illustrates the fact that Shingo 's former name has nothing to do with hebrews .
While we 're at it , let 's come back briefly to the Sawaguchi emblem , below .
To claim that is resembles a Star of David , even from far away , is obviously an exageration : how , tracing two triangles , could one " miss " a branch ?
Let 's assume such a feat .
Would have it been possible to identify " Star of David == jew " in the first century ?
King David , of whom this symbol is supposed to be the emblem , did not exist , at least as a powerful king , as he was at most a chief of village .
For a long time , the " star of David " was used as a lucky charm , before being adopted as an identification symbol for jews during the Renaissance ( 16th century ) .
The real jewish symbol during Christ 's time was the menorah kept inside the temple of Jerusalem .
The cross , in turn , was not adopted as a symbol of Jesus before the 5th century .
The symbols used in the Takeuchi document are therefore anachronistic .
And what about the " semitic " appearance of Mr. Sawaguchi ?
It has nothing exceptional !
In the japanese population , taller , longer - nosed , lighter skinned than average individuals can be seen in every regions .
Moreover , apart from the late Mr. Sawaguchi , the other family members , including Mr. Sawaguchi himself ( interviewed in video on the DVD ) , are the average japanese type .
No , all things considered , as a great number of family emblems in Japan , the Sawaguchi star is simply a idealized flower like , for example , this one which grows on the slope of the hill where their family tomb is located :
Now , let 's look again at the famous " testament of Jesus Christ " .
Written in japanese ?
2000 years ago ?
Come on !
Japanese can write only since around the 6th century .
As for the katakana , used in this " testament " , they appear only during the 9th century !
It is therefore perfectly impossible for a 2nd century document to have been written using characters nonexistent at that time ... unless , of course , His condition of son of God gave Jesus adequate supernatural powers .
Nethertheless , the form of the characters used suggests that the document dates back to the first half of the 20th century , which is also the period during which Takeuchi did announce his astounding discovery .
A last one before we hit the road : at the end of the " testament " , Jesus Christ 's signature , イスキリスクリスマス神 , " Jsus Chris , Christmas god " , how pretentious !
So we are entitled to conclude that this Jesus and Santa Claus are a single entity !
Afterthought :
Not a problem after all As we just saw , this " tomb of Christ " thing is merely a scheme to have tourists come to the village , and it is , indeed , a full success .
Of course , nobody seriously believes it , in addition it is remarkably set up .
Nethertheless it's an excellent pretext to go sightseeing some of the most beautiful landscapes in Japan , where the forest in hosting much wonders ...
Let 's take another example .
Did you know that , a few kilometers away from Christ 's grave , you can find - at least , according to the local legend ( see the photo below ) - the real Garden of Eden ?
If you look a little , you will probably discover in the surroundings a number of local " mysteries " .
Mr. Imamura himself , Aomori prefect and popular figure , uses the english expression " Mystery tour " , with his always smiling face .
The real miracles of this country are , as everybody will have understood , inside the benevolent imagination of its inhabitants .
I for one invite you to go there for a trip , you are most likely to come back astounded ( and with , why not , a bottle of Jesus sake in your luggage ) .
We only touched the surface of the matter in this short article , but a much larger compilation of documents , including several hundreds of high definition photographs and scans , as well as a documentary on video , is in the works in the form of a DVD to be released .
You can reserve your own now !

Bloomberg
( Bloomberg ) -- Cybersecurity software maker McAfee Corp. has filed to go public , adding to the roster of companies rushing to cash in on a hot market for U.S. initial public offerings .
The San Jose , California - based company listed the size of the offering as $ 100 million in a filing Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
The amount is a placeholder that will likely change .
McAfee ’s planned offering is part of a software IPO boom this year .
The biggest listing for an operating company on a U.S. exchange is software maker Snowflake Inc. , which raised $ 3.86 billion including so - called greenshoe shares this month .
Software companies account for $ 12.8 billion of the $ 102 billion raised this year on U.S. exchanges , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
Shares of those newly public software companies have gained 78 % on an weighted average basis , the data show .
Intel , TPGMcAfee was previously a unit of Intel Corp. which bought the software maker in a $ 7.7 billion deal that closed in 2011 .
The chipmaker argued that security was becoming increasingly important to computer users and that integrating security functionality into its processors would add to their value .
That high - level justification for the purchase was never translated into practical applications which enhanced Intel ’s main business .
The unit continued on primarily as a retail software vendor not connected tightly to its parent ’s offerings .
In 2016 , Intel announced that it had signed a deal to transfer a 51 % stake in the business to TPG for $ 1.1 billion .
The transaction valued the spun - off company at $ 4.2 billion , including debt .
TPG and Thoma Bravo are listed as McAfee ’s backers in Monday ’s prospectus .
For the 26 weeks ended June 27 , McAfee had a profit of $ 31 million on revenue of 1.4 billion , according to its filing .
The company said it lost $ 146 million on revenue of $ 1.29 billion during the comparable period last year .
Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , TPG Capital , Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are leading the share sale .
McAfee plans to list on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MCFE .

Some fuss has been made over here in the UK when yesterday , many of our ISPs began filtering Wikipedia content .
The controversy encircles a 1976 album cover for German Heavy Metal band , The Scorpions , depicting a naked prepubescent girl on the front of their “ Virgin Killer ” sleeve .
The UK ’s Internet Watch Foundation says it could be illegal and have added the image to their child - pornography black list .
Internet commentary is alight with arguments of hypocrisy and futility in banning access to an image that is ready available for sale as the cover of the in - print album in question .
The image has apparently been reproduced in a number of books also , some of which available from the British Library itself .
Want to see the image in question ?
Not a problem .
Just jump to Amazon where you can not only see what all the fuss is about , but even purchase the album .
The image was originally censored with a carefully positioned jewel - case crack and airbrushed nipples , but was still banned in many countries .
The six major UK ISPs are apparently routing Wiki traffic through transparent proxies which makes it impossible for Wikipedia admins to control site abuse .
A single IP proxy address may represent an ISPs entire user - base and blocking it would effectively block edit access to all users .
By not blocking it , malicious users would have free reign .
Over in London , I can confirm that Virgin Media have blocked access to the page in question , making it seem as if the page failed to load .
Also , after a look at a few BitTorrent sites , it ’s clear that the maelstrom created by the futile filtering has only served to heighten interest in the band .
UPDATE :
The Wikipedia page is back up .
With the original image .
Strangely , both Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk have removed the image from their product pages .

Alternate historians from Harry Turtledove to Winston Churchill love to play with the Civil War , positing changes that could forever alter the timeline .
Check out our list of the war 's alternate endings .

Through a Fortuitous Victory in Gettysburg
“ If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg ” by Winston Churchill : Churchill ’s work of speculative fiction is narrated from the perspective of a historian in universe where the Confederacy won the Civil War .
The victory allowed Lee ’s forces to push on and take Washington , eventually pushing Lincoln to admit defeat .
Immediately after Lee ’s victory , he rose to such prominence in the Confederacy that he was able to effect the abolition of slavery , paving the way for an alliance between England and the Confederate States .
England then helped broker a peace treaty between the Union and Confederacy , effectively ending the Civil War by appealing to a sense of common language and culture .

Bring the Jubilee by Ward Moore : Hodge Backmaker was born in what was left of the United States of America after the War of Southern Independence .
After the war , the North , never enjoying an Industrial Revolution suffers in poverty , while the prosperous Confederacy annexes Mexico , Central America , and eventually all of South America .
Hodge becomes a historian and realizes that the fall of Washington , the Great Retreat to Philadelphia and the eventual occupation of Philadelphia by the Confederate Army was all a result of Meade ’s loss at Gettysburg , which , thanks to time travel , he has an opportunity to witness ( and possibly alter ) first hand .

What If the South Had Won the Civil War ? by MacKinlay Kantor : Originally published in Look Magazine in 1960 , Kantor ’s classic work imagines that Grant died before taking Vicksburg and that Lee ’s troops defeated the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg .
But the split is less acrimonious that one might think .
The Confederacy eventually abolishes slavery , and after some time apart , the two countries contemplate a reunion .

“ Sidewise in Time ” by Murray Leinster : Leinster is credited with introducing the alternate history trope to pulp science fiction with this story of people traveling across timelines .
One character finds himself travel through a pocket of time filled with Confederate towns in a timeline in which the CSA had won the Battle of Gettysburg .
Advertisement
Of course , not everyone thinks Lee ’s victory at Gettysburg would have changed the course of history .
In Newt Gingrinch and William R. Forstchen ’s Gettysburg , Lee wins the battle , and has continued success in Grant Comes East .
But , by the end of Never Call Retreat , the Confederacy has lost the war .
By Changing the Fate of Special Order 191

How Few Remain by Harry Turtledove : After Lee ’s Special Order 191 is lost , it is recovered by a Confederate soldier , ensuring that it never falls into the hands of George McClellan .
Thus , Lee ’s forces catch McClellan by surprise and they destroy the Army of the Potomac in the Battle of Antietam .
Once Lee marches on Philadelphia , Britain and France officially recognize the Confederacy .
The South wins its independence and sets off the events for Turtledove ’s Timeline - 191 .
“ What Will the Country Say : Maryland Destiny ” by David M. Keithly ” Special Order 191 still ends up in McClellan ’s hands , but it turns out that the Confederate messenger did n’t really lose the order .
Instead ,
Lee planted the message and ordered the messenger to “ lose ” it deliberately , baiting a trap for McClellan ’s forces .

By Allying Itself with England and / or France
C.S.A. : The Confederate States of America :
In this fictional documentary film , Confederate Secretary of State Judah Benjamin succeeds in drawing Britain and France into an alliance with the Confederacy before the Battle of Gettysburg , turning the tide of war in favor of the South .
The Confederation reigns over all of North America except “ Red ” Canada , institutionalizing racism and segregation , and continuing the practice of slavery .

“ Hell on Earth : Anglo - French Intervention in the Civil War ” by Andrew Uffindell : After the Trent Affair , the Confederacy causes increased tensions between the Union and Britain by manufacturing a series of incidents along the Canadian border .
Britain eventually declares war on the Union and France follows suit .
The Union enjoys some early victories in the Great Lakes , but its hand is eventually forced .
Advertisement
However , in both Robert Controy ’s 1862 and Harry Harrison ’s Stars & Stripes Forever , England joins the Confederacy after the Trent Affair , in which the Union seized two Confederate diplomats from a British ship .
In 1862 , the Union somehow manages to beat back both the Confederacy and the world ’s great military power , all in less time than in our universe .
And in Stars and Stripes , the bungling British leaders inadvertently attack a Confederate base , leading the Union and Confederacy to fight back against a common enemy a soundly defeat the British forces .
With More Effective Commanders

/> Gray Victory by Robert Skimin : Since Jefferson
Davis did n’t replace the more effective General Joseph Johnston with the dashing but reckless John Bell Hood , the Confederate forces survived the Atlanta campaign and exhausted the Union Army .
Tired of war , the Northern voters oust Abraham Lincoln in favor of George McClellan .
McClellan quickly recognizes the Confederacy as its own nation .
But anti-slavery groups on both sides of the Mason - Dixon continue to antagonize the Confederacy .
“ We Will Water Our Horses in the Mississippi : A.S. Johnston vs. U.S. Grant ” by James R. Arnold : AS Johnston is wounded at Shiloh , but survives and , after a year , reenters the war .
He successfully coordinates John Pemberton and Joe Johnston , and secured the defeat of Ulysses S Grant by William Loring at the Mississippi .
He secures the West and sends forces East to support Lee .

“ When the Bottom Fell Out : The Crisis of 1862 ” by Michael R. Hathaway : Robert E. Lee never fell from his horse after the Second Battle of Manassas .
Without his mind clouded with pain from his injuries , Lee became a more effective commander .
His impressive victories against the North attract the approving attention of Britain and France , who intervene to mediate the conflict .
And a demoralized Union agrees to peace .

By Strengthening Its Navy
“ Ships of Iron and Wills of Steel : The Confederate Navy Triumphant ” by Wade Dudley : Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory convinces the cabinet to build a fleet of ironclad ships .
The new fleet defeats the Monitor , breaks the Union blockade , and prove a viable threat to coastal Northern states .
The Confederacy ’s ocean power enables it to starve McClellan ’s forces into surrender and leads to Britain ’s recognition of Confederate sovereignty .

By Employing Black Soldiers Earlier in the War
“ Confederate Black and Gray : A Revolution in the Minds of Men ” by Peter G. Tsouras : Jefferson Davis and the Confederate cabinet take a cue from Patrick Cleburne ’s manifesto and allow slaves to join the Confederate Army in exchange for their freedom .
This not only bolsters the Southern forces , it demoralizes the Union troops and improves diplomatic relations between the Confederacy and France and Britain .
The Union Army falls apart after the death of William Sherman and newly elected President McClellan recognizes the Confederacy .

With the Aid of Time Travelers
Advertisement
The Guns of the South by Harry Turtledove : Members of South Africa ’s white supremacist Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging group travel to 1864 to supply the Confederates with 21st Century weapons .
Between the advanced weapons and the time travelers ’ intimate knowledge of the Union ’s plans , Lee ’s victory is an easy one .
Advertisement
But even time travelers can’t guarantee a victory .
In Harry Harrison ’s A Rebel in Time , a racist colonel takes a gun back in time in an attempt to alter the course of the war , only to be thwarted by a fellow time traveler .
And in Charles L. Harness ’ “ Quarks of Appomattox , ” neo - Nazis offer Robert E. Lee a device that disintegrates metal , claiming that a divided America will ensure Germany ’s later victory .
But Lee lists all those strange little things that have happened during the war – the loss of Special Order 191 , the absence of Stonewall Jackson from Gettysburg due to a freak accident – which prevented what should have been his certain victory .
Deciding that God himself is trying to send him a message , Lee declines the Nazi ’s offer and goes off to knowingly lose the war .

The tools Mr. Moser keeps in his Brooklyn studio reveal the complexity of his trade : a ladder ; a thick roll of cotton ; jars of emollients , solvents and glues ; an exhaust to rid the room of noxious fumes ; a lamp whose hue mimics daylight ; and dried pigment , palettes and brushes of all shapes and sizes .

He is part chemist , part repairman and part artist .
“ There ’s a little bit of connecting the dots in this work , ” Mr. Moser said .
“ It ’s not an exact science that you say , one of this , two of that , three of these and you ’re done . ”
Unlike plastic surgeons , who strive to turn back time , conservators aim to lessen time ’s damage without altering the nature of a piece of art .
Theirs is an unhurried , measured and solitary task :
They toil alone , accompanied sometimes by music ( for Mr. Moser on a recent Sunday , it was Bach ’s Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major ) and always by the faces and sceneries they caress with gentle brushstrokes .
The urge , Mr. Moser said , is to keep going , to keep on mending a painting ’s imperfections even when no one else can notice them .
It is an internal battle between obsession and restraint that he knows , for the sake of fidelity to a portrait ’s epoch and a painter ’s style , can end only one way .
“ Once I start to get a palette ”  the white on a soldier ’s uniform is no longer yellowed or a gushing fountain in the background is unveiled from under layers of varnish and dust  “ then I know it ’s time to stop , ” Mr. Moser said .
A small plane carrying Mexico's Interior Minister and a former attorney - general crashed in a wealthy Mexico City neighbourhood on Tuesday , killing at least eight people and injuring dozens more , officials said .
Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said there were no survivors , but government officials did not confirm that Interior Secretary Juan Camilo Mourino and former assistant attorney - general Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos had died .
Mr Ebrard said " there is no other possibility " of survivors considering the force of the crash , which set two dozen cars ablaze and spread pieces of wreckage across a wide area .
The flight was traveling from the city of San Luis Potosi to Mexico City .
Secretary of Transportation Luis Tellez confirmed that Mourino and Vasconcelos were aboard .
The small plane went down in Mexico City 's wealthy Lomas de Chapultepec neighbourhood .
Television footage showed cars in flames and rescue authorities dashing about on the ground to control the flames and keep spectators away .
Mr Ebrard said that 1800 people were evacuated from area offices .
Civil aviation officials were investigating the cause of the crash , he said .
" Firemen , police and ambulances are on site .
It was a plane travelling from San Luis Potosi [ in central Mexico ] with nine passengers aboard .
Some cars burned too , " a ministry official said .
" The explosion was enormous , the flames rose higher than the buildings on Reforma [ the capital 's main avenue ] , " a witness said .
Parked cars at the site of the crash were seen burning in television footage from the scene .
Officials did not say what type of plane it was .
The cause of the accident , which occurred shortly before 7 pm local time , was unclear .

Get to know GCC 4
What 's new in the GNU Compiler Collection release series
GCC is the cornerstone of development in both the open source and closed source worlds .
It 's the enabler of architectures and operating systems .
When a new processor appears , its success depends on a version of GCC that will support it ( a back end that can generate code for it ) .
GCC is also the enabler of Linux® .
Linux as an operating system is widely successful because it is run on so many different architectures .
Once again , a port of GCC to the target environment enables Linux to be ported and run on it .
Without trying to put too fine a point on it , GCC paves the way for Linux and embedded development .
But GCC can't just sit still .
New processor architectures continue to appear , and new research finds better ways to optimize and generate code .
So GCC moves forward and has now matured into its fourth major release .
This article explores the fundamental changes in GCC version 4 to show you why — if you have n't switched yet — the time has come to use the compiler standard .
Short history
GCC originally stood for GNU C Compiler when it was first released by Richard Stallman in 1987 .
( A historical timeline of GCC is shown in Figure 1 . )
Richard started the project in 1984 with the desire to build a free C compiler that could be used , modified , and evolved .
GCC originally ran on early Sun and DEC VAX systems .
As an open compiler ( that is , the source was freely available ) , others began to provide fixes and — more importantly — updates for new languages and target architectures .
Not long after , its acronym was changed to mean GNU Compiler Collection , as it supported numerous languages targeted to the most popular ( and esoteric ) architectures .
Figure 1 . A modern history of GCC releases
Today , GCC is the most popular compiler toolchain available .
The same source base can be used to build compilers for Ada , Fortran , the Java™ language , variants of C ( C++ and Objective - C ) and covers the largest number of target processor architectures of any compiler ( 30 supported processor families ) .
The source base is also completely portable and runs on more than 60 platforms .
The compilers are highly tunable , with a large number of options for tweaking the generated code .
GCC , in short , is the Swiss Army knife of compilers and redefines the meaning of flexibility .
It is also the most complex open source system that exists : Today , GCC is made up of almost 1.5 million lines of source code .
Wow !
With all of that , you 'd think I was truly enamored with GCC .
Let 's just say that when I 'm developing software with GCC and my wife walks into the room , I feel a little uncomfortable .
Before you start
Compilers are constructed in a pipeline architecture made up of several stages that communicate different forms of data ( see Figure 2 ) .
The front end of a compiler is language specific and includes a parser for the given language that results in parsed trees and the intermediate representation ( the Register Transfer Language , or RTL ) .
The back end is then responsible for using this language - independent representation and product instructions for the particular target architecture .
To do this , the optimizer uses the RTL to create fast or more compact code ( or both , when possible ) .
The optimized RTL is then fed to the code generator , which produces target code .
Figure 2 . Simplified view of the compiler stages
Core changes for GCC 4
GCC 4 brings many changes to the standard compiler suite , the biggest of which is around support for optimizations with the introduction of the tree Static Single Assignment ( SSA ) form .
But in general , the compiler is faster in some optimization modes and provides many new enhancements , including new target support .
GCC 4 is also much more thorough when it comes to warnings and errors ( in fact , certain warnings may now show up as errors with GCC 4 ) .
One drawback to GCC 4 is that it is not binary - compatible with objects built with the GCC 3 compilers ( which means that source must be recompiled with GCC 4 ) — unfortunate , but it 's the price to be paid to move forward .
Let 's look at some of the key advancements introduced with the new GCC 4 .
The 4.0 release series
The 4.0 release ( 4.0.4 being the last in the series ) is the first step into GCC 4 .
As such , it was not recommended for production development until a stabilization process could be completed .
This release included a large number of changes — two in particular being the introduction of a new optimization framework ( Tree SSA ) and support for autovectorization .
Prior to GCC 4 , the intermediate representation used was called Register Transfer Language ( RTL ) .
RTL is a low - level representation very close to assembly language ( inspired by LISP S - expressions ) .
The problem with RTL is that the optimizations it enables are those close to the target .
Optimizations that require higher - level information about the program may not be possible , because their expression is lost in RTL .
Tree SSA is designed to be both language independent and target independent while supporting improved analysis and richer optimizations .
Tree SSA introduces two new intermediate representations .
The first is called GENERIC , which is a generic tree representation that 's formed from the language front - end trees .
The GENERIC trees are converted into GIMPLE form and a subsequent control flow graph to support SSA - based optimizations .
Finally , the SSA trees are converted into RTL , which the back end uses for target code generation .
An overly simplified description , but the result is a new intermediate form better suited for high - and low - level optimizations .
( See Related topics for more details on this process . )
As the changes really represent a new framework , it 's possible to define new optimizations .
Several new optimizations have been implemented to date , but more work is obviously ahead to ensure that GCC generates the most compact and efficient code possible .
Another interesting change for GCC 4 is the addition of a loop vectorizer ( based on the Tree SSA framework ) .
Autovectorization is a feature that allows the compiler to identify scalar processing loops within code that can benefit from vector instructions available in the target processor .
The result is tighter and more efficient target code .
Another loop - based optimization is Swing Modulo Scheduling ( SMS ) , which is used to construct instruction pipelines with the goal of minimizing cycle counts by exploiting instruction - level parallelism .
More information on each of these new approaches is available in Related topics .
Finally , the 4.0 series also introduced ( in addition to many C and C++ changes ) a new Fortran front end that supports Fortran 90 and 95 ( rather than the older Fortran 77 , which was supported in GCC 3 ) .
New Ada 2005 features can also be found as well as support for Ada features on many more target architectures .
The 4.1 release series
With the new optimization framework in place , the 4.1 release series introduced a larger number of optimizations , such as improved profiling support and more accurate branch probability estimation .
Two of the more useful optimizations are better inline support and the ability to exploit the instruction cache locality .
When functions are to be inlined , the compiler no longer inlines functions that are not executed frequently .
Instead , hot call sites are more likely to be inlined to keep the code size small while still getting inline function benefits .
GCC can also help to partition functions into hot and cold sections .
Keeping hot functions together ( that is , those functions that are used more often ) results in better instruction cache use compared to polluting the cache with cold functions .
The front end saw a number of updates , including support for Objective - C++ .
There were also a very large number of updates for the Java core library ( libgc ) .
The back end saw the introduction of support for the IBM ®
System z™ 9-109 processor , including 128 - bit Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) floating point numbers and atomic memory access built in .
If that were n't enough , the back end can now emit code to protect against stack - smashing attacks ( that is , buffer overflow detection and reordering to protect against pointer corruption ) .
Some built - in functions have also been updated to protect against buffer overruns with a minimal amount of overhead .
The 4.2 release series
The 4.2 release series continued with new optimizations and enhancements that covered both languages and processor architectures .
The back end was updated to include support for Sun 's UltraSPARC T1 processor ( codenamed Niagara ) as well as Broadcom 's SB - 1A MIPS core .
The front end also saw changes in version 4.2 with the overhauling of C++ visibility handling and support for Fortran 2003 streaming input / output ( I/O ) extensions .
But one of the most interesting changes in the 4.2 release was the addition of OpenMP for the C , C++ , and Fortran compilers .
OpenMP is a multi- threading implementation that allows the compiler to generate code for task and data parallelism .
Using one aspect of OpenMP , code is annotated with areas in which parallelism should occur using preprocessor directives .
The code is converted into a multi- threaded program for the duration of block , then joined back together as each thread within the block finishes .
Figure 3 provides a look at how this process works in practice .
OpenMP provides not only a set of pragma s ( that is , preprocessor directives ) but also functions for C , C++ , and Fortran .
In Figure 3 , you see a simple program that directs elements of code into multiple threads ( parallelizing the for block ) .
The effect is shown graphically in Figure 3 : A traditional program would execute the loop sequentially , whereas the OpenMP implementation creates threads to parallelize the for block .
You can learn more about OpenMP in Related topics .

The 4.3 release series
The current release series in GCC 4 is 4.3 .
This release series shows an acceleration of features and supported architectures ( as well as unsupported architectures , as many obsolete architectures and ports have been removed ) .
New language support was added for Fortran 2003 as well as a host of general optimizer improvements .
New processors supported in this release include several in the Coldfire processor family , the IBM System z9 EC / BC processor , the Cell broadband engine architecture 's Synergistic Processor Unit ( SPU ) , support for SmartMIPS , and numerous others .
You 'll also find compiler and library support for Thumb2 ( compressed ARM instructions ) and for the ARM v7 architecture as well as tuning support for Core2 processors and the Geode processor family .
In the front end of the compiler , the internal representation for GIMPLE was redefined , meaning that the compiler consumes less memory .
Beyond the 4.3 release
Work has already begun on the 4.4 release series , and its moving toward a general release .
In version 4.4 , you 'll find numerous bug fixes and more general optimizer improvements .
Version 3.0 of the OpenMP specification has also been integrated for C , C++ , and Fortran .
The compiler will also now allow you to define an optimization level at the function level ( instead of at the file level , which was the previous default ) .
This functionality is provided by the optimize attribute , which also allows you to specify the individual options for the optimizer .
Finally , processor support was added for the Picochip , which is a 16 - bit multi-core processor .
What 's interesting about the Picochip is that each core can be programmed independently , with communication provided in a mesh .
What 's ahead ?
The future is obviously bright for GCC .
The toolchain continues to evolve — both architecturally and incrementally — to support the latest in processor architectures .
You 'll also find that the language landscape is well covered by GCC .
Under development is support for a number of different languages , such as Mercury , GHDL ( a GCC front end for VHDL ) , and the Unified Parallel C language ( UPC ) .
In addition to GCC 's bright future , its continued improvement means benefits for all types of software ( from Linux and Berkeley Software Distribution [ BSD ] to Apache and everything in between ) .
Software compiled with GCC 4 will be generally more compact and faster , meaning software industry goodness all around .

The national web censorship apparatus being built by the Australian government will also include technology to restrict peer - to - peer traffic , according to the minister responsible for the plan .
Until today it had been thought that what opponents have called the " great Aussie firewall " - in a nod to Chinese internet censorship - would target only data transmitted over HTTP or HTTPS .
In response to suggestions by commenters on his blog that censoring web content would drive more peer - to - peer traffic , broadband minister Stephen Conroy wrote : " The Government understands that ISP - level filtering is not a ' silver bullet ' .
We have always viewed ISP - level filtering as one part of a broader government initiative for protecting our children online .
" Technology is improving all the time .
Technology that filters peer - to - peer and BitTorrent traffic does exist and it is anticipated that the effectiveness of this will be tested in the live pilot trial . "
Conroy did n't offer any further detail on how BitTorrent traffic will be " filtered " during the trials , which are set to run during the first half of 2009 with volunteer ISPs .
They will filter websites against a blacklist for a minimum of six weeks .
In the UK ISPs use a blacklist of " child porn " websites maintained by the Internet Watch Foundation , an industry - backed group rather than government organisation .
The recent climbdown over its censoring of a Scorpions album cover on Wikipedia demonstrated the pitfalls of even a self - regulatory approach .
The Australian plan proposes much more government influence .
Prime minister Kevin Rudd's Australian Labor government has committed AUS $ 125.8 m over four years to what it calls " cyber- safety measures " .
The great Aussie firewall is the centrepiece of the initiative , and has provoked strong opposition .
Hundreds of protestors gathered in major Australian cities last week , and some in the country 's internet industry have derided the plans too .
In November , Michael Malone , boss of ISP iiNet , told the Sydney Morning Herald : " They 're not listening to the experts , they 're not listening to the industry , they 're not listening to consumers , so perhaps some hard numbers will actually help . "
He pledged to take part in the pilot to help demonstrate that the system would be ineffective .
Conroy 's offhand announcement today that peer - to - peer traffic will be filtered is likely to add criticism of the Australian government from the filesharing community to that being voiced by free speech campaigners and the internet industry . ®
Over the past several weeks , engineers and technicians working at General Motors Corp .'s sprawling proving grounds west of Detroit started noticing a curiosity : an increasing number of wall clocks had the wrong time , or stopped working altogether .
The reason :
As part of a drive to cut $ 15 billion in costs , GM is no longer keeping the 562 clocks in working order , which will eliminate the expense of replacing and disposing of the clock 's batteries and the cost of resetting them twice a year for daylight - saving time .
It 's ...
WASHINGTON  Officials weighing federal applications by utilities to build new coal - fired power plants cannot consider their greenhouse gas output , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency ruled late Thursday .
Some environmentalists fear the decision will clear the way for the approval of several such plants in the last days of the Bush administration .
The ruling , by Stephen L. Johnson , the administrator , responds to a decision made last month by the Environmental Appeals Board , a panel within the E.P.A. , that had blocked the construction of a small new plant on the site of an existing power plant , Bonanza , on Ute tribal land in eastern Utah .
The Supreme Court ruled last year that the agency could regulate carbon dioxide , the most prevalent global warming gas , under existing law .
The agency already requires some power plants to track how much carbon dioxide they emit .
But a memorandum issued by Mr. Johnson late Thursday puts the agency on record saying that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant to be regulated when approving power plants .
He cited “ sound policy considerations . ”
Eurozone members combine to form an economy which vies with the US Official EU figures released later are expected to show that the eurozone is in recession , as world leaders head to Washington for a key economic summit .
Analysts predict the 15 - nation area's economy will shrink in the third quarter of this year , following a 0.2 % reduction during the second quarter .
On Thursday , government data showed Germany slipped into recession .
But France has escaped that fate , with the economy growing 0.1 % in the third quarter , official data showed .
Ahead of the figures , French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde unveiled the news in an interview on French radio .
She told RTL radio that the French economy had expanded by 0.14 % in the third quarter , thereby escaping the technical definition of a recession , which is two quarters of negative growth .
It would be a terrible mistake to allow a few months of crisis to undermine 60 years of success
President Bush
Q&A : G20 summit France 's economy shrank by 0.3 % in the second quarter .
" The figure is astonishing because everyone was expecting a negative figure and preparing for a recession , " she said , pointing out that stable consumption and company investment helped to support the economy .
European blues
On the other hand , Italy has now followed Germany into recession , with official data confirming that its economy shrank by a larger - than - expected 0.5 % in the June - to - September period .
This follows a contraction in the previous three months of 0.4 % .
Meanwhile , separate figures showed that the Spanish economy shrank in the third quarter for the first time since 1993 .
In the three months to September , the eurozone 's fourth - largest economy contracted by 0.2 % .
Analysts believe that a recession in Spain is now unavoidable , driven by a slump in household spending and a property crisis .
" We now expect the eurozone to show a quarterly GDP fall of 0.3 % or 0.4 % in the third quarter , " said Gilles Moec at Bank of America .

The BBC's Ben Shore says the numbers make the employment and pay prospects for 320 million Europeans look grim , but it will also serve to focus minds in Washington where leaders of the G20 developed and emerging economies will begin talks over the weekend .
Economic summit
The group , representing 85 % of the world 's economy and two - thirds of its population , is to discuss how to contain the financial crisis and agree on longer - term reforms to reduce the risk of a repeat .
Ahead of the summit , Gordon Brown called for worldwide tax cuts and spending increases to prevent the global economy from slipping into recession .
" We need to agree on the importance of co-ordination of monetary and fiscal policy , " he said .
" There is a need for urgency .
By acting now , we can stimulate growth in all our economies .
The cost of inaction will be far greater than the cost of any action . "
US President George W Bush insisted the financial crisis was not a failure of free - market capitalism .
Speaking in New York , he said the surest way back to sustained economic growth was not to reinvent the system , but to reform it .
" The answer ... is to fix the problems we face , make the reforms we need , and move forward with the free - market principles that have delivered prosperity and hope to people all across the globe , " he said .
Critics say Mr Bush 's words are unlikely to convince those who see the crumbling US economy as an indictment of his own policies .
On Thursday , data showed the number of US workers drawing unemployment benefits had hit a 25 - year - high of 3.9 million in the week to 1 November .
Protracted slowdown Official EU figures for the third quarter are expected to show that the eurozone has slipped into recession - defined as two quarters of negative growth - with forecasts of a 0.1 % drop in GDP , following a 0.2 % contraction between April and June .
Germany 's fall in economic output was driven by falls in exports
On Thursday , official figures showed the German economy , one of the world 's largest , had shrunk 0.5 % in the third quarter , following a 0.4 % drop in the second quarter .
On Wednesday , the Bank of England said the British economy was probably already there .
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) says economic activity is expected to fall 0.5 % in the eurozone next year as the world 's leading economies enter a protracted slowdown .
In further evidence of the deteriorating economic climate , new car sales were down 14.5 % in October , the sixth month in a row of declines .
' Human crisis ' Meanwhile , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has said his country and the EU could " speak with one voice " at the G20 summit hosted by US President George W Bush .
" Russia is ready , together with the EU and other partners , to participate in working out the parameters of a new financial architecture , " he said .
If hundreds of millions of people lose their livelihoods and their hopes for the future are dashed because of a crisis they have absolutely no responsibility for , the human crisis will not remain just economic
Ban Ki-moon
UN Secretary - General
The G20 meeting will bring together both leading industrial powers such as the US , Japan and Germany , and emerging market countries such as China , India and Brazil .
The heads of the World Bank and the IMF , the UN secretary - general and the chairman of the Financial Stability Forum have also been invited to attend .
The leaders are scheduled to dine at the White House on Friday evening and hold two plenary sessions on Saturday , followed by a statement by President Bush .
They hope to agree on a common set of principles for future reform , including changes to the organisations charged with regulating the world economy .
Later summits will focus on working out the details of the reforms needed .
Japan 's prime minister said it would lend up to $ 100bn to the IMF
In an open letter to the G20 published on Thursday , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon urged them to prevent the economic slowdown causing a " human tragedy " among the poor , particularly in developing countries .
" If hundreds of millions of people lose their livelihoods and their hopes for the future are dashed because of a crisis they have absolutely no responsibility for , the human crisis will not remain just economic , " he warned .
Mr Ban said that even though more than 170 countries would not be present in Washington , he stressed " they also face grave difficulties " and that immediate action was more vital for them than reform of global financial institutions .
Japan has announced it is prepared to lend up to $ 100bn to the IMF to help emerging economies hit by the financial crisis .
The loan offer is a part of a package of measures that the Japanese Prime Minister , Taro Aso , intends to present at the G20 summit .
The IMF has already provided more than $ 30bn of emergency loans to Iceland , Hungary and Ukraine .

去 る10月に、マイクロソフト(株) が「 Microsoft Office Input Method Editor 2007 」 （以 下IME 2007）修正プログラムを公開したことをご存じだろうか？（関連リンク）
IME 2007 の変換精度については、ネット上での批判が少なくない。また、「使い続けるほど馬鹿になる」という評価は、IME 2007 以前 のWindows やOfficeのIME（以下MS IME）にも寄せられていた。筆者もそうした現象に耐えかねて、MS IMEからATOKシリーズに乗り換えたクチである。
ところが、この修正プログラムの説明文によると、「変換精度の改善」「学習機能の強化 」
「学習副作用の抑制」などの修正により、問題点が改善されるとある。IME
2007の変換精度問題はなぜ起こり、それがどう改善されたのか？
同社への取材を通じて、IME
2007にまつわる様々な疑問にお答えしよう。
なおIME 2007 については 、Office 2007 Service Pack 1でも別の修正プログラムが提供されている（関連リンク2）。Office 2007がインストールされている環境で、Microsoft Updateを使っていれば自動で適用されていると思われるが、もしOffice 2007がSP1になっていないようなら、先にこちらを適用しておこう。
IME 2007 は中国製……ではな い
Q1 そもそ もWindows VistaのIMEとIME 2007 は違うの？
A1 違う 。Windows Vistaの付属IME（以 下Vista IME ）は 、Office 2003 付属のIMEと同じエンジンを使っている。そのため、IME
2007とはエンジンがまったく異なる（後述）。同社インフォメーションワーカービジネス本部
オフィス製品マーケティンググループ シニアプロダクトマネージャの飯島圭一氏は「IME 2007 が『Word』なら 、Vista IME は 『Word Pad』のようなもの」と評している。最新の技術や機能は、Office付属のIMEから導入されていくというわけだ。
Q2 日本語IMEの開発は中国で行なわれているって本当？
A2 日本語IMEの開発は、日本で行なわれている。同社インプット
メソッド テクノロジー シニアマネージャの佐藤良治氏によると、IME 2007 以前のプロトタイプ開発の際には、日本だけでなく米国レドモントと中国北京にあるMicrosoft Researchとの共同作業が行なわれたという。それが誤解して伝わっているようだ。
日本でのIME開発は専任チームを置いて、ほかのアプリケーション開発と同じように独自に行なっているという。IME開発は日本のほかに、韓国、中国、台湾にチームがあって、各言語に依存しない要素（OSとのインターフェースなど）の開発は、これら4チームによる共同作業で行なわれている。専任チームの規模は日本が最も大きいとのことだ。
Yesterday I wrote briefly about my development to deployment pipeline , and I very briefly mentioned Fabric , which is a Capistrano - like tool written in Python that helps remove mindless repetition from deployment .
For a long time I was content with the SSH into the server and do stuff approach to deployment ( I 'm not managing any large deployments , and am usually dealing with small projects without the resources for staging servers and such ) , but I 've been intoxicated by Fabric 's sweet poison , and I think it 's a noticable improvement -- even for the smallest of deployments .
Briefly , I think using Fabric ( or something similar ) is a real win because :
You never have to leave your system .
You get to use your tools , your files , your setup .
You only have to type one command to perform the deployment .
Even for simple deployments you 're still typing one or two dozen shell commands ( changing directories , pulling from version control , rebooting the server ) , and you just do n't have to type those commands anymore .
Even if that seems like a small gain , I think it 's more than that , because you can actually deploy without breaking your programming flow .
With a good deployment solution , you type once and then run it many times , so you 're more likely to do things the right way instead of the quick way .
( Repetition leads to boredom , boredom to horrifying mistakes , horrifying mistakes to God - I - wish - I - was - still - bored , and it goes downhill from there . )
Other developers , even those who wake up with a cold sweat when dreaming about linux administration , can deploy and rollback as well .
If you throw a five minute GUI on top , then even your grandmother can be out there deploying and rolling back your production servers .
By abstracting the deployment process into a simple deployment script you 're making it easiser for other people to do your job for you .
Which is a good thing .
Unless you 're worried that you seem unproductive at work .
Then you might not like Fabric .
It scales well to large environments .
Now let 's take a brief stroll through my Fabric setup .
Using Fabric
You can install Fabric using easy_install , but I 'm using the current Git checkout , and the project is still young enough that code written for the latest packaged release will not work for the current development head1 .
So I recommend you install it from its Git repository .
git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/fab.git cd fab sudo python setup.py build install
Now go into your Django project directory and create a file named fabfile .py .
Let 's start out by adding a few utility functions I use for managing Git repositories .
def git_pull ( ) : " Updates the repository . " run ( " cd ~ / git / $ ( repo ) / ; git pull $ ( parent ) $ ( branch ) " ) def git_reset ( ) : " Resets the repository to specified version . " run ( " cd ~ / git / $ ( repo ) / ; git reset -- hard $ ( hash ) " )
Note a few important things :
The connection between Fabric and your server is not a persistent connection .
That means you cannot use commands like cd in multiple commands and expect them to work .
# this works as expected run ( " cd ~ / git / $ ( repo ) / ; git pull $ ( parent ) $ ( branch ) " ) # this will run the command in the wrong directory run ( " cd ~ / git / $ ( repo ) / " ) run ( " git pull $ ( parent ) $ ( branch ) " )
Fabric uses its own system for string interpolation .
Usage is like this : # standard python string interpolation run ( " git pull %s %s " % ( " origin " , " master " ) ) # Fabric string interpolation config .
parent = " origin " config .
branch = " master " run ( " git pull $ ( parent ) $ ( branch ) " )
Fabric 's approach makes it easier to pass state around between various commands .
Well , that 's their story anyway .
I 'm not going to defend the approach beyond saying that I suspect they 're working around some pain point in their architecture .
Now that we have those Git utilities , lets fill in the rest of the fabfile .
py so that it can take advantage of the utilities .
The first thing you should do is create one or more functions , one for each set of servers you want to handle in a different way .
For example , if you have a cluster of production servers and a cluster of staging servers , then you 'd write something like this :
def production ( ) : config .
fab_hosts = [ ' a.example.com ' , ' b.example.com ' ] config .
repos = ( ( ' project ' , ' origin ' , ' master ' ) , ( ' app ' , ' origin ' , ' master ' ) ) def staging ( ) : config .
fab_hosts = [ ' a.staging_example.com ' , ' b.staging_example.com ' ] config .
repos = ( ( ' project ' , ' origin ' , ' master ' ) , ( ' app ' , ' origin ' , ' master ' ) )
The fab_hosts value is a special value that Fabric uses to determine the servers to run commands on , but the repos value is something that I added in myself for my scripts .
You can add as many arbitrary values to config as your heart desires .
Now to put together the three functions I use for managing deployment .
def reboot ( ) : " Reboot Apache2 server . " sudo ( " apache2ctl graceful " ) def pull ( ) : require ( ' fab_hosts ' , provided_by = [ production ] ) for repo , parent , branch in config .
repos : config .
repo = repo config .
parent = parent config .
branch = branch invoke ( git_pull ) def reset ( repo , hash ) : " " " Reset all git repositories to specified hash .
Usage : fab reset:repo=my_repo,hash=etcetc123 " " " require ( " fab_hosts " , provided_by = [ staging , production ] ) config .
hash = hash config .
repo = repo invoke ( git_reset )
To understand this code , it helps to know that there are a few magic functions that Fabric uses for deployment .
run runs a command on another machine .
runs a command on another machine .
local runs a command on your local machine .
runs a command on your local machine .
sudo runs a command on another machine as root .
runs a command on another machine as root .
put sends a file to another machine from your local machine .
sends a file to another machine from your local machine .
invoke runs another function with the current function 's configuration context .
runs another function with the current function 's configuration context .
require creates dependencies among various functions , to prevent functions from being run without their prerequisites .
Now deployment is as easy as :
cd directory_with_fabfile / # reboot the server fab production reboot # you can do all this on staging too fab staging reboot # update the git repositories fab production pull # update repositories then reboot fab production pull reboot # reset repositories then reboot fab production reset: repo = my_app_repo , hash = 13klafeomaeio23 reboot
This makes administration painless and quick as hell .
But , hey , lets add just a little more spice .
Let 's add a deployment option that will only deploy your project if all its tests pass :
def test ( ) : local ( " python manage . py test " , fail = " abort " )
And now you could deploy if and only if all tests pass by using this command :
fab test pull reboot
Now , let 's say that you have some bad apples on your development team and even with the test option they still keep pushing broken code to your server .
You could update pull to look like this :
def pull ( ) : require ( ' fab_hosts ' , provided_by = [ production ] ) invoke ( test ) for repo , parent , branch in config .
repos : config .
repo = repo config .
parent = parent config .
branch = branch invoke ( git_pull )
Now they wo n't be able to deploy their changes unless all the tests pass successfully .
( Or they edit fabfile .py , but that is n't the point . ;)
I hope you 're starting to get some ideas about how integrating Fabric into your deployment workflow can make your life a bit happier .
It 's useful , and it 's fun .
What more can you ask for ?
Full Source
Here is the complete code we put together in this article .
REPOS = (( " my_project " , " origin " , " master " ) , ( " my_app " , " origin " , " master " ) ) def production ( ) : config .
fab_hosts = [ ' a.example.com ' ] config .
repos = REPOS def staging ( ) : config .
fab_hosts = [ ' a.staging_example.com ' ] config .
repos = REPOS def git_pull ( ) : " Updates the repository . " run ( " cd ~ / git / $ ( repo ) / ; git pull $ ( parent ) $ ( branch ) " ) def git_reset ( ) : " Resets the repository to specified version . " run ( " cd ~ / git / $ ( repo ) / ; git reset -- hard $ ( hash ) " ) def reboot ( ) : " Reboot Apache2 server . " sudo ( " apache2ctl graceful " ) def pull ( ) : require ( ' fab_hosts ' , provided_by = [ production ] ) for repo , parent , branch in config .
repos : config .
repo = repo config .
parent = parent config .
branch = branch invoke ( git_pull ) def test ( ) : local ( " python manage . py test " , fail = ' abort ' ) def reset ( repo , hash ) : " " " Reset all git repositories to specified hash .
Usage : fab reset:repo=my_repo,hash=etcetc123 " " " require ( " fab_hosts " , provided_by = [ production ] ) config .
hash = hash config .
repo = repo invoke ( git_reset )
As always , comments , suggestions and complaints are welcome .
If you 're looking to do more complex things with Fabric , then I highly recommend browsing he mailing lists , which managed to answer all my questions without me actually asking any .
How dare you throw that tea into Boston Harbor !
Such is the anti-democratic arrogance of the fear - mongering pundits and politicians who tell us if we taxpayers do n’t instantly give the Wall Street banking bandits a $ 700 - billion bailout , we are destroying America .
Instead of applauding representatives from both parties who , for once , heeded the public rather than the fat cats , the established pundits blasted those who dared get out of line .
It was a time for some of the best commentators to fail and , as much as I hate to admit it , for Lou Dobbs , and even Newt Gingrich , to shine .
Dobbs called it correctly :
The sky is not falling , there is time for reasoned debate , and why is n’t the public being listened to ?
Gingrich put it best when he said short - circuiting serious congressional oversight over an enormous transfer of taxpayer dollars to an industry is “ un-American . ”
Others , with whom I typically am in far greater agreement , just rolled over to give the bankers what they demanded .
“ When Madmen Reign ” was the headline on a column by Bob Herbert in The New York Times that absolves the Democrats from any responsibility for the crisis despite a willingness of their party ’s leadership in the past to vote for key legislation proposed by what Herbert condemns as the “ anti-regulation , free market zealots ” of the Republican Party .
Both parties betrayed the principles of a true free market — remember Adam Smith ’s invisible hand , under which no market player could unilaterally set price ?— in favor of the concentrated power of oligopoly to control everything .
Those Republicans who dared to vote , this time , against the demands of the Wall Street power brokers were derided by New York Times conservative columnist David Brooks as engaging in the “ Revolt of the Nihilists . ”
While suddenly embracing President Franklin Roosevelt ’s New Deal as the positive alternative to nihilistic behavior , Brooks ignored Roosevelt ’s main achievement , which was to put the public interest before that of the Wall Street titans .
Was n’t it nihilistic when Congress , led by Republicans but supported by key Democrats , including then - President Bill Clinton , shredded the protections put into place by Roosevelt to control an ever - avaricious banking industry ?
Anyone who has bothered to study that history knows that Sen .
John McCain was deeply involved in the push for rampant deregulation , and his choice of former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm , the principal author of the decisive deregulation legislation , to co-chair the McCain presidential campaign mocks McCain ’s attempt to blame the crisis on everyone but himself .
The Democrats , however , also are culpable , and it was sickening to watch Clinton on “ The Daily Show ” getting away with blaming a crisis he helped create on overexcited home purchasers .
I do n’t blame “ Daily Show ” host Jon Stewart for not knowing enough about the subject to challenge Clinton on his own fervent support of deregulation , but it is disappointing that Paul Krugman , an economist and one of the nation ’s sharpest commentators , should also miss that point .
Indeed , in his column for The New York Times castigating McCain for his connection to Gramm , Krugman said voters should be reassured that Barack Obama has Clinton ’s treasury secretary , Robert Rubin , to turn to for advice on how to handle this mess .
Rubin , the former head of Goldman Sachs , worked as hard as Gramm to pass the legislation his Wall Street buddies wanted .
Rubin then returned to Wall Street as a honcho at Citigroup , the first company to successfully exploit the new legislation ’s nefarious loopholes .
As for his insight , it was as recently as January of this year that Rubin termed the financial meltdown a normal phase of the business cycle .
Back in the spring , two months after Rubin ’s “ what , me worry ? ” silliness on the economy , Obama gave a brilliant speech on Wall Street ’s problems at the same venue , Manhattan ’s Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art , in which he singled out as central to the problem the legislation that Rubin had gotten Clinton to sign .
Obama should stick with the wisdom of a community organizer from the tough side of Chicago :
Fight the bankers who swindle unsuspecting homeowners , and restore the bailout provision that Democratic leaders had proposed but then abandoned — stopping the home foreclosures by empowering bankruptcy court judges to force a renegotiation of terms .
Any bailout worthy of support should put endangered homeowners first , not the bankers who swindled them .

VICTORIAN state primary school students will soon have an alternative  religious education lessons taught by people who do not believe in God and say there is " no evidence of any supernatural power " .
The Humanist Society of Victoria has developed a curriculum , which the State Government accreditation body says it intends to approve , to deliver 30 - minute lessons each week of " humanist applied ethics " to primary pupils .
Accredited volunteers will be able to teach their philosophy in the class time designated for religious instruction .
As with lessons delivered by faith groups , parents will be able to request that their children do not participate .
Victorian Humanist Society president Stephen Stuart said : " Atheistical parents will be pleased to hear that humanistic courses of ethics will soon be available in some state schools . "
But the body that accredits Victoria 's 3500 Christian religious instruction volunteers , Access Ministries , says humanism is not a religion and so should not be taught in religious education time .
I 've been working with Perl and XML recently , and -- let 's just say -- there is a reason why Perl is n't listed on my resume .
That said , after getting started with XML :: Simple I 've been really happy with the stuff I 've been able to write in Perl and the general Perl workflow ( have problem , download solution from CPAN , insert glue , repeat ) .
So here is a tutorial for using XML :: Simple for people who are n't ancient masters of Perl - fu .
The first step is to install XML :: Simple from CPAN .
perl - MCPAN -e shell install XML :: Simple exit
Okay a brief musing : why is it that Ruby Gems and CPAN both feel so much more comfortable to use than easy_install ( the Python solution ) ?
I feel like Perl and Ruby are the only communities to ever like their module repository systems , and they are extremely similar to each other , but I 'm not quite sure how they 're particularly different from easy_install .
Is it as simple as easy_install coming later in the timeline of the language ?
( I 'm not even sure that 's the case , but it certainly feels like the community has never completely accepted it , or that the acceptance has been grudging . )
I think even the Common Lisp community has been more successful in unifying behind ADSF : INSTALL than Python , and the Common Lisp struggles to standardize almost anything ( an unavoidable consequence of having no standard implementation ) .
Is it just the :: ?
Would everyone love easy_install if we wrote import datetime : : datetime ?
Maybe it 's all just in my mind .
Basically what XML :: Simple does is transform XML into Perl datastructures and Perl datastructures into XML with a very simple api .
The hardest part of using XML :: Simple is having a working understanding of dereferencing references for vector and hash datastructures .
Now let 's load in an XML file from disk .
use XML : : Simple ; use Data : : Dumper ; my $xml = new XML : : Simple ; my $ in = $ xml -> XMLin ( ' my_file.xml ' ) ; print Dumper ( $ in ) ;
Now let 's create a datastructure and save it to disk .
use XML : : Simple ; my $xml = new XML : : Simple ; my $ out = { ' an - attribute ' => ' an attribute value ' , ' another - attribute ' => ' yada yada ' , ' types ' => [ " a " , " b " , " c " ] , ' people ' => [ { ' name ' => ' will ' , ' content ' => ' etc ' } , ] } ; my $ dec = ' < ? xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ? >'
; print $ xml -> XMLout ( $ out , XMLDecl => $ dec , RootName => ' random ' ) ;
There are basically three rules that you need to know to create the output you want :
A scalar in a hash is an attribute .
Unless it 's key is content , in which case it is the element 's primary content .
Scalars and hashes within a list are represented as elements .
Well , it 's still kind of confusing despite that explanation .
It 's probably easier to look at the XML output by that script :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?>
< random an- attribute= " an attribute value " another - attribute= " yada yada " > < people name= " will " > etc </ people > < types > a </types > < types > b </types > < types > c </types > </random >
As a final example , lets grab an RSS feed , extract it 's information and store it to disk in a different format .
We 're going to grab the main RSS feed for this blog , which looks like this after being converted to Perl ( with some data stripped out for space constraints ) :
$ VAR1 = { ' version ' => ' 2.0 ' , ' channel ' => { ' link ' => ' http://lethain.com/' , ' lastBuildDate ' =>
' Thu , 06 Nov 2008 10:48:35 - 0600 ' , ' language ' => ' en - us ' , ' item ' => [ { ' link ' =>
' http://lethain.com/entry/2008/nov/06/you-only-learn-the-first-time/' , ' guid ' =>
' http://lethain.com/entry/2008/nov/06/you-only-learn-the-first-time/' , ' title ' => ' You Only Learn the First Time ' , ' pubDate ' => ' Thu , 06 Nov 2008 10:48:35 - 0600 ' , ' description ' => ' full article ' } ] } }
Based on that we can write our script like this .
use LWP : : Simple ; use XML : : Simple ; use Data : : Dumper ; my $xml = new XML : : Simple ; my $ uri = ' http://lethain.com/feeds/all/'
; my $ rss_xml = $ xml -> XMLin ( get ( $ uri ) ) ; my @articles = ( ) ; foreach my $ article ( @ { $ rss_xml -> { channel } -> { item }} ) { my $ a = { ' title ' => $ article -> { title } , ' date ' => $ article -> { pubDate } , ' link ' => $ article -> { link }} ; push ( @articles , $ a ) ; } my $ out = $ xml -> XMLout ( { ' article ' =>\ @articles } , RootName => ' articles ' ) ; print $ out ;
The ( truncated ) output of running the script looks like this :
< articles > < article date= " Thu , 06 Nov 2008 10:48:35 - 0600 " link= " http://lethain.com/entry/2008/nov/06/you-only-learn-the-first-time/ " title= " You Only Learn the First Time " /> < article date= " Wed , 05 Nov 2008 08:00:00 - 0600 " link = " http://lethain.com/entry/2008/nov/05/bad-ideas-and-regular-expressions-in-templates/ " title= " Bad Ideas and Regular Expressions in Templates " /> < article date= " Tue , 04 Nov 2008 10:38:10 - 0600 " link= " http://lethain.com/entry/2008/nov/04/deploying-django-with-fabric/ " title= " Deploying Django with Fabric " /> < article date= " Mon , 03 Nov 2008 12:51:00 - 0600 " link= " http://lethain.com/entry/2008/nov/03/development-to-deployment-in-django/ " title= " Development to Deployment in Django " /> < article date= " Wed , 29 Oct 2008 10:11:54 - 0600 " link= " http://lethain.com/entry/2008/oct/29/creating-slideshows-with-cocos2d-iphone/ " title= " Creating Slideshows with Cocos2d iPhone " /> < article date= " Mon , 27 Oct 2008 10:45:00 - 0600 " link= " http://lethain.com/entry/2008/oct/27/customize-site-style-by-user-with-django-userskins/ " title= " Customize site style by user with django - userskins " /> </articles >
I 'm still very inexperienced and realize I am writing something like Python - in - Perl , but I think it 's impressive how concise Perl makes accomplishing these routine tasks , and how quickly CPAN facilitated stringing together a couple of libraries to do a typical task pretty painlessly .
So far in my journey into Perl , my only complaint is that few of the tutorials do a good job of explaining the dereferencing syntax , perhaps because it is sufficiently complex that it merits its own tutorials .
It 's too bad that Perl does n't have the sex appeal of Python and Ruby for young programmers , it 's a fun tool .
( Although I do n't forsee using it for anything beyond fairly simple scripts and services . )

ROME ( Reuters ) -
An Italian couple who were caught having sex in a church confessional box while morning Mass was being said have repented and made peace with the local bishop .
The couple , in their early 30s , were detained by police earlier this month after they had made love in the confessional box in the cathedral in northern Cesena .
They were cautioned for obscene acts in public and disturbing a religious function .
Their lawyer said they had been drinking all night and realized they had gone too far .
The lawyer told the area ’s local newspaper on Wednesday the couple met with the local bishop on Tuesday night , asked for his forgiveness and that he had given it .
Last week the bishop celebrated a “ Mass of reparation ” in the cathedral where the confessional box incident took place to make up for the sacrilege .
But in the end , ketchup is just ketchup , is n’t it ?
Not really .
For Americans , ketchup always contains tomatoes and vinegar and some kind of sweetener , along with spices , and a brand named Heinz .
H.J. Heinz Co. ( HNZ ) reported a 22 % rise in its fiscal second - quarter profit and indicated that it may take fewer price increases on its products amid weakening consumer spending and falling commodity prices .
The company is still going ahead with some selected price hikes , but indicated that price cuts were unlikely .
Food companies have raised prices steadily over the last year amid soaring commodity prices .
Investors and analysts have been watching closely to see how these companies now will handle the subject of price increases as commodities have pulled back and global economies have weakened .
Price increases play a big role in offsetting costs , but in a weak economy companies run the risk of pushing away penny - pinching consumers .
There has been some speculation that retailers may also be resisting efforts by manufacturers to raise prices .
The company took a fair amount of price hikes in the second quarter and that discussions with retailers on pricing are a “ little more difficult . ”
Read
“ We plan on less pricing going forward , but we do anticipate some offsetting benefits from the decline in commodity prices over time . ”
Heinz ’s second - quarter net income rose on higher prices and a currency - hedge gain .
While its North American consumer - products business saw 2.9 % volume growth amid strength in its biggest products , including Heinz Ketchup and Ore-Ida potatoes , declines in Europe , Asia and at restaurants resulted in overall volume falling 1.3 % .
Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow said the volume decline was disappointing .
Heinz shares were recently down 1.3 % to 37.51 .
The company posted net income for the quarter ended Oct. 29 of $ 276.7 million , or 87 cents a share , up from $ 227 million , or 71 cents a share , a year earlier .
The latest quarter ’s results included a $ 92 million pretax gain from currency hedging .
Revenue rose 3.5 % to $ 2.61 billion .
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting earnings of 76 cents a share on revenue of $ 2.7 billion .
Gross margin fell to 35.2 % from 36.9 % amid currency fluctuations and the continued commodity - cost increases , which Heinz has n’t been able to fully offset with its price hikes .
The company noted some costs have eased since crude oil peaked in July , but it will take time for Heinz to realize the benefits .
Many large food companies say they locked in contracts and hedges on commodities earlier in the year and wo n’t feel the benefits of falling raw material costs till those positions wear off in coming quarters , and point out that prices of some raw materials are still high .
The company reiterated its fiscal - year outlook .
From Rodin and Courbet 's naked muses and lovers to Degas 's clinical study of the female form , the nude has always taken pride of place in French art .
But Paris is now being accused of showing such philistine ingratitude to its life models that scores went on strike yesterday , taking to the streets to pose naked in freezing temperatures to shame the state .
In front of the tastefully decorated Christmas trees outside Paris city hall 's culture department , the naked and goose - pimpled models demanded a pay increase , proper contracts and , most of all , respect for their craft as they held trade union banners in the pose of Delacroix 's Liberty Leading the People .
The disrespect shown to the models was " proof that something is badly wrong with French society " , shouted one shivering male model through a megaphone .
Artists , students and art teachers sat sketching them in support .
The row began when Paris city hall , which runs an array of life - drawing classes , banned the tradition of the " cornet " , a piece of art paper rolled into a cone and passed round for tips as a model gets dressed after class .
Surviving on the minimum wage with no fixed contracts , holiday pay , security cover or job security , the crash - strapped models said the tips allowed them to survive .
They also wanted to quash the misconception that life - modelling was merely something students and retired people did for pocket money .
Sean Connery may have posed naked in Edinburgh to make ends meet when he was a struggling actor and Quentin Crisp may have spent the war years posing naked at Derby School of Art , but in France life - modelling is widely seen as a serious career choice .
" This is a craft that should be respected , not just anyone can take their clothes off and hold a pose , " said Deborah , 28 , one of the strike organisers , who has worked as a full - time life model for four years .
" It is artistic and physically demanding work . "
She had to swim regularly to stay fit enough to hold poses and felt models should be given access to subsidised municipal sports facilities to keep in shape for their jobs , as well as access to museums to do research for their poses .
Leela , 33 , a singing teacher and part - time model , said the " cornet " was crucial to supplement her pay of € 10 an hour .
" Everyone puts in one or two euros , which can add up to € 20 to € 30 .
The next day I can go to the market and fill my fridge . "
Gerard Vilage , an art teacher from Paris 's Beaux Arts Ateliers , said : " How can we teach drawing without these people , if they are left with meagre pay and no protection ? "
Christophe Girard , Paris city hall 's culture supremo , who also moonlighted as a life model in his student days , tried to calm the row , urging the ministry of culture to review life models ' status .
He said : " Regarding tips , we can't let people collect money that 's not taxed while working in a state building .
" But I think this was a lovely protest in the French , gaulois spirit of resistance - taking your clothes off outside 10 days before Christmas shows real conviction .
" Life modelling is an activity that is fragile and possibly under threat and I do n't want to see it disappear . "
Case study : Christophe Lemée , 52
After 30 years as an actor , I began life modelling to support my own theatre projects .
It 's a beautiful craft and very physically demanding .
You have to forget yourself and move beyond the contours of your own body .
It 's not my body the artists are trying to capture , but the essence of human nature , existence and all the mystery that goes with it .
I will often do nine - hour days - you have to be very athletic to do that .
Each session is three hours long , divided into 45 minute poses followed by 15 minutes ' rest .
It 's no easier holding a sitting pose than a standing pose .
The weight will always be concentrated on some part of your body .
I call it dancing without moving .
You need a lot of psychological concentration to cope .
You have to learn what your body can and can't do .
I try to swim for an hour in the mornings to keep my body in condition for the poses .
You are naked and defenceless in front of a room full of people , but it 's not the same brash nudity you see everywhere in modern society .
It 's more spiritual .
I 'm exposed but I know that the people looking at me are exactly the same as me under their clothes .
Life - modelling has always been crucial for western art , which is all about the glorification of the human body .
You have a profound artistic relationship with the people who draw you and that is very rewarding .
A team of 20 physicists from four institutions has literally made something from nothing , creating particles of matter from ordinary light for the first time .
The experiment was carried out at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center ( SLAC ) by scientists and students from the University of Rochester , Princeton University , the University of Tennessee , and Stanford .
The team reported the work in the Sept. 1 issue of Physical Review Letters .
Scientists have long been able to convert matter to energy ; the most spectacular example is a nuclear explosion , where a small amount of matter creates tremendous energy .
Now physicists have succeeded in doing the opposite : converting energy in the form of light into matter -- in this experiment , electrons and their anti-matter equivalent , positrons .
Converting energy into matter is n't completely new to physicists .
When they smash together particles like protons and anti-protons in high - energy accelerator experiments , the initial particles are destroyed and release a fleeting burst of energy .
Sometimes this energy burst contains very short - lived packets of light known as " virtual photons " which go on to form new particles .
In this experiment scientists observed for the first time the creation of particles from real photons , packets of light that scientists can observe directly in the laboratory .
Physicists accomplished the feat by dumping an incredible amount of power -- nearly as much as it takes to run the entire nation but lasting only for a tiny fraction of a second -- into an area less than one billionth of a square centimeter , which is far smaller than the period at the end of this sentence .
They used high - energy electrons traveling near the speed of light , produced by SLAC 's two - mile - long accelerator , and photons from a powerful , " tabletop terawatt " glass laser developed at Rochester 's Laboratory for Laser Energetics .
The laser unleashed a tiny but powerful sliver of light lasting about one trillionth of a second ( one picosecond ) -- just half a millimeter long .
Packed into this sliver were more than two billion billion photons .
The team synchronized the two beams and sent the electrons head - on into the photons .
Occasionally an electron barreled into a photon with immense energy , " like a speeding Mack truck colliding with a ping pong ball , " says physicist Adrian Melissinos of the University of Rochester .
That knocked the photon backward with such tremendous energy that it collided with several of the densely packed photons behind it and combined with them , creating an electron and a positron .
In a series of experiments lasting several months the team studied thousands of collisions , leading to the production of more than 100 positrons .
The energy - to - matter conversion was made possible by the incredibly strong electromagnetic fields that the photon - photon collisions produced .
Similar conditions are found only rarely in the universe ; neutron stars , for instance , have incredibly strong magnetic fields , and some scientists believe that their surfaces are home to the same kind of light - to - matter interactions the team observed .
This experiment marks the first time scientists have been able to create such strong fields using laser beams .
By conducting experiments like this scientists test the principles of quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) in fields so strong that the vacuum " boils " into pairs of electrons and positrons .
The scientists say the work could also have applications in designing new particle accelerators .
Spokesmen for the experiment , funded by the U.S. Department of Energy , are Kirk McDonald , professor of physics at Princeton , and Melissinos , professor of physics at Rochester .
Also taking part in the experiment were William Bugg , Steve Berridge , Konstantin Shmakov and Achim Weidemann at Tennessee ; David Burke , Clive Field , Glenn Horton - Smith , James Spencer and Dieter Walz at SLAC ; Christian Bula and Eric Prebys at Princeton ; and seven other physicists from Rochester , including Associate Professor David Meyerhofer ; graduate students Thomas Koffas , David Reis , Stephen Boege , and Theofilos Kotseroglou ; research associate Charles Bamber ; and engineer Wolfram Ragg .

HONOLULU , Hawaii ( CNN ) -- Bobby Maxwell kept a close eye on the oil industry for more than 20 years as a government auditor .
But he said the federal agency he worked for is now a " cult of corruption " -- a claim backed up by a recent government report .
Bobby Maxwell , a long - time auditor of the oil industry , says his former agency is corrupt " top to bottom . "
" I believe the management we were under was showing favoritism to the oil industry , " Maxwell told CNN .
Maxwell is referring to a tiny agency within the Department of the Interior called the Minerals Management Service , which manages the nation 's natural gas , oil and other mineral resources on federal lands .
A report , conducted by the Interior Department 's inspector general and released earlier this month , found that employees at the agency received improper gifts from energy industry officials and engaged with them in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations .
It looked at activities at the agency from 2003 through 2006 .
Maxwell said the report does n't surprise him .
The agency , he said , is corrupt " top to bottom . "
Watch a failure to " protect America 's interests " »
" It sounds like they forgot they work for the government , " he said .
" It 's disgusting .
...
There 's no excuse for that .
Those people should not be working in those positions at all .
" They crossed a lot of lines that should never have been crossed , " he said .
" They lost all objectivity . "
Maxwell was in charge of keeping track of the millions in royalty payments owed taxpayers by oil and gas companies who explored and found oil on U.S. government lands .
He estimates he and his team were responsible for saving the government close to $ 500 million in royalties , either underpaid or somehow skipped by oil and gas companies , over the years .
He received the Interior Department 's highest award in 2003 for his work .
But not long afterward , his job was killed .
He believes it was retribution for his cracking down on Big Oil and blowing the whistle on what he believes was a " cult of corruption " within the agency .
The Interior Department denies that , saying his job was reorganized as part of routine restructuring .
Just before he lost his job , he said , one of his superiors in Washington ordered him not to investigate why Shell Oil had raised its oil transportation costs .
Maxwell said it jumped from 90 cents to $ 3 a barrel without adequate explanation .
The government paid Shell to transport oil from offshore platforms .
When asked why a government worker would tell an auditor not to investigate , he said : " I believe it started from the top down , " he said .
Shell Oil told CNN it " pays the same rate any shipper does " and that it has " never engaged in fraudulent transactions or entered into sham contracts as Mr. Maxwell alleges . "
Maxwell , a registered independent , said the shift in attitude at the agency began about seven or eight years ago , about the time the Bush administration came into power .
He said he was discouraged from aggressively auditing oil companies .
" Laws and regulations were not applied , also not enforced , " he said .
The inspector general 's 27 - page summary says that nearly a third of the roughly 60 people in Maxwell 's former office received gifts and gratuities from oil industry executives .
Two received improper , if not illegal , gifts at least 135 times , the report says .
It goes on to describe a wild atmosphere in which some staff members admitted using cocaine and marijuana .
In addition , two female workers at the Minerals Management Service were known as the " MMS chicks " and both told investigators they had sex with oil industry officials they were supposed to be auditing .
One e-mail from a pipeline company representative invited government workers to a tailgating party : " Have you and the girls meet at my place at 6 a .m. for bubble baths and final prep ... Just kidding . "
Inspector General Earl Devaney said in a letter to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne accompanying the report that it details " a textbook example of improperly receiving gifts from prohibited sources . "
Maxwell is now retired from the government and teaches at the University of Hawaii .
He said it was just a matter of time until the agency 's behavior was exposed .
He feels vindicated now in the wake of the inspector general 's report , but is still disgusted by what he was happening at the Minerals Management Service .
" Their job is to protect United States taxpayers ' interest .
It 's like they completely forgot that , like they just became part of the oil companies , " he said .
The Interior Department said it could not comment on Maxwell 's specific allegations or removal , saying his former supervisor no longer works for the Interior Department either .
Kempthorne said he was " outraged " by the disclosures in the inspector general 's report and that the actions " of a few has cast a shadow on the entire agency . "
But the department said there is no evidence taxpayers lost money as a result of unethical behavior between government workers and the oil and gas industry .
Maxwell doubts that .
The former auditor said he'd love to put all the government royalty records under his magnifying glass .
" I think the government should be transparent .
We are for the people , by the people .
This is the government .
We 're here to serve , " he said .
Maxwell has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the Kerr - McGee Corp. , an energy company involved in oil and gas exploration .
In it , he claims the company defrauded taxpayers out of millions in oil royalty payments .
The company denies the accusation .
If Maxwell wins , the government would receive about $ 40 million in additonal revenue and Maxwell would be entitled to about a third of that .

Oh this is just rich .
Certified letters have been sent to major businesses supporting No On 8 , demanding that they make a matching donation to the Protect Marriage campaign or risk having their “ opposition to traditional marriage ” exposed .
ProtectMarriage.com , the umbrella group behind a ballot initiative that would overturn the California Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage , sent a certified letter this week asking companies to withdraw their support of Equality California , a nonprofit organization that is helping lead the campaign against Proposition 8 .
“ Make a donation of a like amount to ProtectMarriage .com which will help us correct this error , ” reads the letter .
“ Were you to elect not to donate comparably , it would be a clear indication that you are in opposition to traditional marriage . …
The names of any companies and organizations that choose not to donate in like manner to ProtectMarriage.com but have given to Equality California will be published . ”
The letter was signed by four members of the group ’s executive committee : campaign chairman Ron Prentice ; Edward Dolejsi , executive director of the California Catholic Conference ; Mark Jansson , a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ; and Andrew Pugno , the lawyer for ProtectMarriage.com .
A donation form was attached .
The letter did not say where the names would be published .
Some companies have already started receiving letters , and the people behind the Protect Marriage campaign have vouched for their authenticity .
Equality California executive director Geoffrey Kors responded to the letters , “ It ’s truly an outrageous attempt to extort people .
They are going after our long - term funding and trying to intimidate Equality California donors from giving any more to the No on 8 campaign and from giving to Equality California ever again . ”
Like I needed another reason to hate organized religion .
That ’s it .
There go the gloves .
Any concept of civil discourse is officially off the table .
These people will not be truly happy until all of our rights are taken away and we are kept in cages .
I ’m sorry to be a broken record here but please DONATE today !
Anything you can .
Please , talk to your friends and neighbors .
Get them involved .
We can and will win this thing .
We have to .
Update ( 10/24/08 ) :

A fascinating riff from Matt Bai's new Times Magazine story :
“ I am convinced that if there were no Fox News , I might be two or three points higher in the polls , ” Obama told me .
“ If I were watching Fox News , I would n’t vote for me , right ?
Because the way I ’m portrayed 24/7 is as a freak !
I am the latte - sipping , New York Times - reading , Volvo - driving , no - gun- owning , effete , politically correct , arrogant liberal .
Who wants somebody like that ?
“ I guess the point I ’m making , ” he went on , “ is that there is an entire industry now , an entire apparatus , designed to perpetuate this cultural schism , and it ’s powerful .
People want to know that you ’re fighting for them , that you get them .
And I actually think I do .
But you know , if people are just seeing me in sound bites , they ’re not going to discover that .
That ’s why I say that some of that may have to happen after the election , when they get to know you . ”

Ohio State University scientists are finding that specific elements of marijuana can be good for the aging brain by reducing inflammation there and possibly even stimulating the formation of new brain cells .
Their research suggests that the development of a legal drug that contains certain properties similar to those in marijuana might help prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer ’s disease .
Though the exact cause of Alzheimer ’s remains unknown , chronic inflammation in the brain is believed to contribute to memory impairment .
Any new drug ’s properties would resemble those of tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC , the main psychoactive substance in the cannabis plant , but would not share its high - producing effects .
THC joins nicotine , alcohol and caffeine as agents that , in moderation , have shown some protection against inflammation in the brain that might translate to better memory late in life .
“ It ’s not that everything immoral is good for the brain .
It ’s just that there are some substances that millions of people for thousands of years have used in billions of doses , and we ’re noticing there ’s a little signal above all the noise , ” said Gary Wenk , professor of psychology at Ohio State and principal investigator on the research .
Wenk ’s work has already shown that a THC - like synthetic drug can improve memory in animals .
Now his team is trying to find out exactly how it works in the brain .
The most recent research on rats indicates that at least three receptors in the brain are activated by the synthetic drug , which is similar to marijuana .
These receptors are proteins within the brain ’s endocannabinoid system , which is involved in memory as well as physiological processes associated with appetite , mood and pain response .
advertisement
This research is also showing that receptors in this system can influence brain inflammation and the production of new neurons , or brain cells .
“ When we ’re young , we reproduce neurons and our memory works fine .
When we age , the process slows down , so we have a decrease in new cell formation in normal aging .
You need those cells to come back and help form new memories , and we found that this THC - like agent can influence creation of those cells , ” said Yannick Marchalant , a study coauthor and research assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State .
Marchalant described the research in a poster presentation November 19 at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington , D.C .
Knowing exactly how any of these compounds work in the brain can make it easier for drug designers to target specific systems with agents that will offer the most effective anti-aging benefits , said Wenk , who is also a professor of neuroscience and molecular virology , immunology and medical genetics .
“ Could people smoke marijuana to prevent Alzheimer ’s disease if the disease is in their family ?
We ’re not saying that , but it might actually work .
What we are saying is it appears that a safe , legal substance that mimics those important properties of marijuana can work on receptors in the brain to prevent memory impairments in aging .
So that ’s really hopeful , ” Wenk said .

One thing is clear from the studies :
Once memory impairment is evident , the treatment is not effective .
Reducing inflammation and preserving or generating neurons must occur before the memory loss is obvious , Wenk said .
Marchalant led a study on old rats using the synthetic drug , called WIN - 55212 - 2 ( WIN ) , which is not used in humans because of its high potency to induce psychoactive effects .
The researchers used a pump under the skin to give the rats a constant dose of WIN for three weeks – a dose low enough to induce no psychoactive effects on the animals .
A control group of rats received no intervention .
In follow - up memory tests , in which rats were placed in a small swimming pool to determine how well they use visual cues to find a platform hidden under the surface of the water , the treated rats did better than the control rats in learning and remembering how to find the hidden platform .
“ Old rats are not very good at that task .
They can learn , but it takes them more time to find the platform .
When we gave them the drug , it made them a little better at that task , ” Marchalant said .
In some rats , Marchalant combined the WIN with compounds that are known to block specific receptors , which then offers hints at which receptors WIN is activating .
The results indicated the WIN lowered the rats ’ brain inflammation in the hippocampus by acting on what is called the TRPV1 receptor .
The hippocampus is responsible for short - term memory .
With the same intervention technique , the researchers also determined that WIN acts on receptors known as CB1 and CB2 , leading to the generation of new brain cells – a process known as neurogenesis .
Those results led the scientists to speculate that the combination of lowered inflammation and neurogenesis is the reason the rats ’ memory improved after treatment with WIN .
The researchers are continuing to study the endocannabinoid system ’s role in regulating inflammation and neuron development .
They are trying to zero in on the receptors that must be activated to produce the most benefits from any newly developed drug .
What they already know is THC alone is n’t the answer .
“ The end goal is not to recommend the use of THC in humans to reduce Alzheimer ’s , ” Marchalant said .
“ We need to find exactly which receptors are most crucial , and ideally lead to the development of drugs that specifically activate those receptors .
We hope a compound can be found that can target both inflammation and neurogenesis , which would be the most efficient way to produce the best effects . ”
The National Institutes of Health supported this work .

The internet bank Icesave has suspended all deposits and withdrawals from customers ' accounts after the Icelandic authorities stepped in to rescue its parent company Landsbanki .
Landsbanki's other UK operation Heritable Bank has also stopped savers making withdrawals and is no longer offering mortgages .
Between them the two brands have more than 300,000 customers in the UK , with Icesave winning savers with its high interest rates on savings accounts and Isas .
Today a statement on its website said : " We are not currently processing any deposits or any withdrawal requests through our Icesave internet accounts .
We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause our customers .
We hope to provide you with more information shortly . "
Although Landsbanki is set to continue trading as normal in Iceland , it is not clear what will happen to Icesave or Heritable Bank in the UK , but the Financial Services Compensation Scheme has said it is preparing for the bank to go into default .
A message on its website tells consumers : " The Financial Services Authority in the UK has reported that Icesave is now expected to go into insolvency proceedings in Iceland and this would trigger an FSCS default . "
Yesterday , Icesave 's website went down and its UK call centre is reported to have received unprecedented volumes of calls from savers worried about the safety of their cash .
But a spokeswoman for the group insisted that call volumes had been normal and the website was down due to technical difficulties .
Concerns about the Icelandic economy came to a head yesterday , and the Icelandic government last night presented an emergency bill giving it sweeping powers over the nation 's banks .
This morning the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority ( IFSA ) announced it was taking control of Landsbanki , as it became the latest victim of the credit crunch .
The IFSA said domestic deposits were fully guaranteed by the government , and that " Landsbanki 's domestic branches , call centres , cash machines and internet operations will be open for business as usual " .
Guarantees
The 100 % guarantee does not extend to UK savers , who would have to apply for compensation both in Iceland and the UK , and would only be able to recover up to £ 50,000 .
The first € 20,000 ( £ 16,264 ) they hold is protected under the Icelandic government 's scheme , and the remainder up to £ 50,000 by the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme ( FCSC ) .
A spokesman for Landsbanki said 95 % of Icesave 's customers had deposited less than £ 50,000 , so would be fully protected by the FCSC .
At the start of 2008 , Heritable had around £ 900 m on deposit from UK savers .
It used the money to provide specialist finance for property developments , and some residential mortgages .
All new lending appears to have been suspended .
Unlike , the savers who had their money in an Icesave , all Heritable savers ' money is covered by the FSCS up to £ 50,000 ( £ 100,000 for joint accounts ) in the event that Landsbanki ceases to exist .
Trading normally
As news of Landsbanki 's failure emerged representatives of Kaupthing , the other major Icelandic bank with a significant UK savings operation , were desperately trying to halt a Northern Rock - style run .
By mid-morning concerned savers were deluging the bank 's retail division Kaupthing Edge 's call centre keen to establish whether the bank was still trading , and in many cases to move their money .
The call centre number has been permanently engaged all morning .
Kaupthing Edge , which is thought to have at least 150,000 UK savers on its books , had been offering some of the most attractive savings rates in the market for the past few months .
A spokeswoman for the firm said : " Kaupthing has not been nationalised and is still trading normally .
Yes , people are concerned , but I stress there is no reason to move your money .
There is no reason to panic . "
She added : " All savers ' money is covered to £ 50,000 by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme ( FSCS ) and nothing has changed today in this respect .
The company is processing all requests to move money in the normal way . "
Case study : Nick Stringer stands to lose his retirement fund after locking it away in an Icesave account
We all know the traditional prohibitions against talking politics : avoid it when you can ; do n't get personal ; find common ground .
Thirty million etiquette books can't be wrong , and yet , today , when everyone 's bursting with excitement and exaltation and triumph , the old rules do n't seem to apply !
How can anyone not want to talk about it , you think - how can anyone not be excited ?!
And yet , as we know , not everyone is .
Some very dear friends and relatives and other assorted grinches are glum and , however inexplicable this may seem , these encounters can't be avoided indefinitely .
I learned this the hard way this morning , and ended up in tears of frustration and rage .
So listen up : however tempting it may be to do a victory dance and rub their faces in the mud and toss " loser ! " around like grass seed , here 's a better idea .
I read through a slew of old - timey manuals - A 1938 Emily Post , my trusty Miss Manners 1940 's Today 's Etiquette , The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette and 1937's Etiquette for Every Day , to bring us advice on this subject and created a digest of sorts . *
The etiquette books are right about one thing : try to avoid it .
Put it off as long as possible .
Wait until passions have cooled .
Avoid calls .
Do n't pretend solicitude , do n't try to be adult , do n't try to convince anyone or assume anybody 's mind has been changed by the outpouring of joy and enthusiasm that 's swept you up .
This is n't only to preserve family harmony ; rather , it 's a way for you to enjoy things for a little while before reality intrudes .
- Stick to a Script .
As with any tricky conversation , this is invaluable advice .
Stick to talking points : this is what I did last night ; yes , I 'm happy ; I know this is n't what you wanted but let 's all try to be optimistic .
( This last bit of inclusive language sounds extra-mature . ) - Keep It Short .
THIS IS ESSENTIAL .
Things can only go in one direction and that 's pear - shaped .
Holidays are coming and big fight should be avoided at all costs .
Manufacture an excuse to end the call beforehand if possible .
- Do. Not. Gloat .
Nearly impossible , true .
But empathy is essential here .
There 's nothing worse than a bad winner .
- Have an exit strategy .
This comes courtesy of Anna Post , who advises lines like , " I guess we just do n't see eye - to - eye ; or : I 'll have to consider that ; or : For me , it 's private . "
- End on a good note .
If it 's a family member , " love " is always a good option .
If not , a warm " take care , " shows you to be a mature adult who 's a fitting representative for her candidate .
* It should be said this all presupposes a certain degree of reason on the part of your conversational partner .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President - elect Barack Obama may consider delaying a campaign promise - to roll back tax cuts on high - income Americans - as part of his economic recovery strategy , two aides said on Sunday .

REUTERS / Frank Polich
David Axelrod , the Obama campaign strategist who was chosen to be a senior White House adviser , was asked if the tax cuts could be allowed to expire on schedule after tax year 2010 rather than being rolled back by legislation earlier .
“ Those considerations will be made , ” he said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
Bill Daley , an adviser to Obama and commerce secretary under former President Bill Clinton , said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” that the 2010 scenario “ looks more likely than not . ”
President George W. Bush ’s tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2010 .
After that they would revert to 2001 levels , when the top individual tax rate was 39.6 percent .
Obama has called for reducing taxes for the middle class , but requiring the wealthiest Americans to pay more than the current top rate of 35 percent .
His aides ’ comments suggest Obama may be wary of imposing any additional tax burden at a time of deep crisis , despite the outlook for record budget deficits and mounting national debt .
He may also be seeking to bolster Republican support for his recovery measures .
“ The main thing right now is to get this economic recovery package on the road , to get money in the pockets of the middle class , to get these projects going , to get America working again , and that ’s where we ’re going to be focused in January , ” Axelrod said .
Obama said on Saturday he was crafting an aggressive two - year stimulus plan to revive the economy , aiming to save 2.5 million jobs by January 2011 through projects including transportation infrastructure , school modernization and alternative energy .
Obama called in October for a $ 175 billion stimulus measure , but he suggested he was ready to push for a much larger package .
U.S. Sen . Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat who is part of the majority leadership team in the Senate , told ABC ’s “ This Week ” that an economic recovery package between $ 500 billion and $ 700 billion is needed and could be ready by the time Obama takes office on January 20 .
“ I think it has to be deep .
In my view it has to be between five and seven hundred billion dollars , ” Schumer said .
Aankoop
Deze 1976 Lincoln Continental Mark IV kwam ik tegen op ' Carsonline.com ' .
Hij stond te koop bij een Lincoln Mercury dealerschip , genaamd Middelkauff .
Het leek me een geschikte Lincoln , vanwege de kleurstelling , het feit dat hij nog origineel was en de lage mijlenstand .
K*** , de verkoper , vertelde me dat de eigenaar van hun dealership , Mr Middelkauff , deze Mark IV van een ' lady ' gekocht had in Burley Idaho met 40500 originele miles op de teller .
Ook bleek het te gaan om een Emilio Pucci uitvoering , één van de vier designer uitvoering van Mark IV in 1976 die tegen een meerprijs verkrijgbaar waren .
Cartier , Bill Blass , Givenchy en de Pucci uitvoering , met ieder een eigen kleurenstelling , samengesteld door bekende designers .
Leuk detail , de prijs was ook goed te doen , en vertrouwen in de verkoper had ik .
Hoe pak je zoiets aan ?
De auto staat helemaal in Twin Falls Idaho en ik heb de auto niet eens gezien .
Ik had alleen 16 foto 's waarop ik kon zien hoe hij eruit zag .
Hoe hij technisch gezien erbij staat , geen idee .
Ik ben ook nog maar 17 , zit in me examenjaar en heb nul ervaring met het regelen van zoiets .
Maar goed , gewoon doen .
Eerst uitzoeken hoe we geld aan de overkant van de plas krijgen .
Dat zou via PayPal kunnen maar dat accepteerden ze toen niet , dus ik had Bic / Swift en Bankcodes nodig om het geld over te kunnen maken .
Deze verstrekken Amerikanen natuurlijk niet zomaar via de mail , daarom werd mij verzocht om mijn ' bankier ' naar hun office manager te laten bellen voor de transfer info .
Ik heb iemand bij de lokale bank zo gek gekregen om voor mij te bellen .
De codes waren geregeld en het geld kon overgemaakt worden , maar niet helemaal .
Codes klopte niet , m'n bank weer voor me bellen , en dit keer wel goede codes .
Goed het geld was overgemaakt , althans , het geld was van mijn rekening af !
Blabla , lang verhaal .
Na lange tijd wachten op een bevestigen deed ik zelf poging om de verkoper te bereiken .
De verkoper moest met spoed naar Las Vegas omdat z'n zwager overleden was , en owja ; het geld was aangekomen .
Goed nieuws !
leek me .
Vervolgens via mail , printen scannen het papierwerk geregeld .
Ik heb nu officieel een Lincoln gekocht !
Transport
Op een tip over een goed adres voor het transport ben ik ingegaan en heb contact opgenomen met Ka*** .
Ze regelde voor mij het transport van Twin Falls Idaho naar Los Angeles op de trailer .
Enige onduidelijkheid was er wanneer hij precies opgehaald zou worden .
Na het contacten van K*** , de verkoper , bleek dat de Lincoln in de ' after hours ' was opgehaald en verder had hij geen info .
( Great ! )
30 Augustus bleek hij opgehaald te zijn , later kreeg ik te horen dat hij 7 september in Long Beach aangekomen was .
Natuurlijk wel direct om foto's gevraagd , want je weet maar nooit !
Duurde wel tot 3 oktober voordat ik die kreeg , maar goed .
Vond het wel fijn om te zien dat hij daadwerkelijk daar staat !
De geplande verscheepdatum was 4
Oktober en hij zou dan 5 November aankomen in Rotterdam , werd me verteld .
Het wachten begon !
Aankomst
Na een maand niks vernomen te hebben kreeg ik bericht dat de boot 7 November was aangekomen en dat ik iemand anders moest contacten om het af te handelen .
Nou prima , de container moest gelost worden en ' vracht ' ingeklaard .
Zaterdag kreeg ik het bericht dat ik hem op kon halen .
Dat werd te kortdag , en zondag werd hem niet dus dan maandag 12 November maar een dag school skippen en 's middags ophalen samen met A***.
Ik zat mezelf ondertussen op te vreten toen we richting Schiedam reden .
Bij de loods aangekomen , deur open en daar staat hij :
Rode loeder met grijs vinyl dak achterin de loods .
Vergeet ik nooit meer !
Behoorlijk dof uitgeslagen , maar op eerst gezicht verder precies zoals ik had verwacht .
Het interieur zag er top uit !
Na het aftikken reed A*** ( ik had nog geen rijbewijs ) richting huis .
De eerste mankementen kwamen naar voren , zoals de vacuümkleppen die open bleven staan , het interieur verlichting wat niet werkte en de motor die last had van nadieselen .
Naar is dat .
Ook bleken ze niet zo voorzichtig te zijn geweest tijdens het transport .
Op het dak zitten wat akelige deuken en krassen wat duidt op het volproppen van de container waar hij in stond .
Ook wat krassen op de ramen .
Gelukkig was hij roestvrij , en in originele staat en dat vond ik al mooi genoeg !
De papieren onthulden dat de vorige eigenaresse Rosie heette wat waarschijnlijk de zoete luchten verklaren van het interieur .
De wagen stond sinds 1979 op haar naam .
Kortom , een wagen met interessante geschiedenis .
RDW
Volgende stap is het klaarmaken van de Lincoln om gekeurd te kunnen worden voor een kenteken .
Op gemak heb ik de sealed beams vervangen , uitlaatdemper tijdelijk dichtgesmeerd en de stadslichten , sidemarkers en corneringlights aangepast / uitgeschakeld .
LPG is er vervolgens ingebouwd .
Met enige onzekerheden ben ik ( met chauffeur uiteraard ) naar het RDW station in Schiedam gereden op 2 Januari .
In alle vroegte waren we nummer 3 in de rij .
Helaas werd hij afgekeurd , de banden vertoonde droogtescheurtjes , hij lekte wat benzine bij de pomp en de reflectoren met E - keur ontbraken achter .
Ook moest hij op LPG afgesteld worden .
Vier nieuwe Maxxis bandjes uit Groningen besteld , en eronder gelegd , benzine lekkage opgelost en wat reflectoren op de bumper geplakt .
De motor bij de garage af laten stellen .
20 Februari zijn we terug gegaan voor een herkeuring , en hij werd goedgekeurd .
Kenteken werd opgestuurd en vervolgens de platen laten maken .
De verlichting weer terug naar origineel en de reflectoren eraf , platen gemonteerd , verzekerd en hij kon officieel de weg op !
Cables have been connected , switches have haven flicked and buttons have been pressed .
The servers are on , let the sharing commence !
W00t !

The November 22 “ End the Fed ” rallies raise a vital issue : it is past time to abolish the unconstitutional , illegal , and failed institution known as the Federal Reserve System , the privately owned central bank which has been looting and wrecking the US economy for almost a hundred years .
We must end a system where unelected , unaccountable cliques of bankers and financiers loyal to names like Morgan , Rockefeller , and Mellon set interest rates and money supply behind closed doors , leading to de-industrialization , mass impoverishment , and a world economic and financial depression of incalculable severity .
The Fed helped cause the crash of 1929 , did nothing to stop the banking panic of 1932 - 33 , and is the main cause of the $ 1.5 QUADRILLION derivatives crisis which is devastating the world .
The Federal Reserve System is Wall Street ’s murder weapon against the United States , and the Fed must be stopped .
The purpose of abolishing the Fed is to get re-industrialization , economic modernization , full employment , and rising standards of living for all the people .
Contrary to monetarist fetishes , the value and soundness of currency in the modern world are determined by the ability of a national economy to produce physical commodities that the rest of the world wants to buy .
The decline of the dollar has its roots in the wanton destruction of the US industrial base initiated by the Trilateral administration of Jimmy Carter and Fed boss Paul Adolph Volcker with his 22 % prime rate .
Over the past forty years , the US standard of living has declined by two thirds , and the country has become a post - industrial rubble field , a moonscape monument to the folly of a post - industrial service economy .
If you want to go back to sound money , you must gear up modern industrial production so that the world will need dollars to buy goods manufactured in this country .
No amount of gold will do the trick .
Gold has a critical role to play in a new international currency system , but returning to a gold coin standard would create the most ferocious deflation of all time .
Got any credit card debt ?
If you do , a gold coin standard would make it infinitely harder to ever pay it off .
You would be slaving for the rest of your life to pay off a $ 5,000 credit card balance , or less .
The United States is blessed by the world ’s greatest tradition of economics , the American System of political and national economy .
Contrary to monetarist mythology , the American System never had anything to do with free trade or “ free markets . ”
It is a tradition of protectionism , mercantilism , and dirigism .
It starts with Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts Bay in the 1600s , who promoted industry and launched a sovereign currency .
Benjamin Franklin , the founder of the post office , was another dirigist .
George Washington was always devoted to infrastructure projects , and Alexander Hamilton created the First Bank of the United States , without which the new nation would have collapsed into poverty , chaos , and a return of British monetarist rule .
James Madison created the Second BUS , again to ward off chaos .
Henry Clay coined the term of The American System , and it meant a national bank , a protective tariff , and national infrastructure financed by the federal government .
Daniel Webster tried to create a third BUS , and when he fell short the slide into slave power and civil war resulted .
Friedrich List , Matthew Carey , Henry Carey , and Justin Morrill were American System economists who influenced or advised Lincoln .
The rise of the US as the world ’s greatest industrial power came thanks to a protective tariff and a controlled currency , the greenbacks .
When Wall Street imposed the Cross of Gold , the American System tradition was continued by the Populist Party .
The New Deal , the fruit of mass struggles and the rise of the labor movement , provided a way out of the Herbert Hoover depression by forcing the Morgan - controlled Fed to knuckle under to the FDR presidency .
JFK tried to revive the New Deal and break the power of the Fed , and was assassinated by the financiers with the help of the CIA .
Mount Kilimanjaro rises majestically from a rolling plain close to the Indian Ocean from hot savanna to a barren and frigid 3 - 1/ 2 mile high peak .
It 's the highest mountain in Africa and one of the largest free standing mountains in the world .
Climbing Kilimanjaro is a must - do challenge for almost every trekker and mountaineer in the world .
Kilimanjaro National
Park takes in the area above the 8,850 feet , or 2,700 meters , on the mountain .
It includes the moorland and highland zones , Shira Plateau , Kibo and Mawenzi peaks .
In addition , the Park has six corridors or rights of way through the Kilimanjaro Forest Reserve .
The Forest Reserve , which is also a Game Reserve , was established in 1921 ; the Park was established in 1973 and officially opened in 1977 .
Kilimanjaro is a giant stratovolcano reaching an elevation of 19,335.6 ft. ( 5,895 m ) .
Other names for this volcano are : Kilima Dscharo , Oldoinyo Oibor ( white mountain in Masai ) , and Kilima Njaro meaning shining mountain in Swahili .
This volcano 's highest and youngest cone is named Kibo .
Shira to the west and Mawenzi in the east are older cones that make up Kilimanjaro .
Kibo has not been active in modern times , but steam and sulfur are still emitted .
At the top of Kibo 's summit is a 1 1/2 mile ( 2 1/4 Km ) wide crater .
Kilimanjaro is the largest of an E - W belt of about 20 volcanoes near the southern end of the East African Rift Valley .
Also prominent in this belt are Ngorongoro caldera - a superb wildlife refuge , Ol Donyo Lengi - a carbonitite volcano , and Meru . Kilimanjaro is a triple volcano with the youngest and central peak of Kibo being 7.5 - 8.7 miles ( 12 - 14 km ) from Shira to the west and Mawenza to the east .
As all of Kilimanjaro 's climbers know the gentle lower slopes steepen to 30 degrees about 13,000 ft. ( 4 km ) elevation .
Shira is topped by a broad plateau , perhaps a filled caldera , and erosion has cut deeply into a remnant rim .
In contrast , Mawenzi 's summit is a steep rocky peak surrounded by cliffs 1,600 ft. ( 0.5 km ) to 4,900 ft. ( 1.5 km ) high .
Erosion has removed the original crater , and a great horseshoe shaped ridge opens to the northeast .
Mile - deep gullies with 30 - 45 degree gradients make many places practically inaccessible .
Massive series of radial and concentric dyke swarm make up more than 30 - 40 percent of the summit area of Mawenzi .
Kibo 's glacier - clad summit , the highest spot in Africa , is a 1.2 x 1.7 mile ( 1.9 x 2.7 km ) caldera , with an inner crater nearly a mile ( 1.3 km ) wide , and inside that a deep , 1,148 ft. ( 350 m ) wide central pit .
Original volcanic forms are preserved at the summit and on many of the flanks , except on the south side where glaciers have cut deeply into the cone .
Nearly 250 satellitic cones occur on Kilimanjaro , most following SE and NW trends .
Estimates suggest that of a total volume of about 1,150 cu. miles , Mawenzi and Shira each contribute roughly 120 cu. mi. of andesites and basalts , Kibo has the same volume of similar but unexposed rocks , plus an additional 107 cu. miles .
Interestingly , more than half of Kilimanjaro 's volume is represented by older , basal basalts ( 672 cu. mi. ) , so once again - as in Cascade stratovolcanoes - a basaltic shield is the most important , but least conspicuous element of a chemically complex volcano .
Kilimanjaro - Africa 's largest volcano and among the largest on the Earth is indeed a beautiful and fascinating volcano of the world .
Even though you can climb throughout the year , January , February and September are the best months , with July , August , November and December also being good .
Equatorial to arctic conditions are present on Kilimanjaro .
The range begins with the warm , dry plains with average temperatures of 85 °F , ascends through a wide belt of wet tropical forest , through zones with generally decreasing temperatures and rainfall , to the summit where there is permanent ice and below freezing temperatures .
The rainiest period is March to June .
The fact that most months of the year have so few rainy days makes it possible to climb in relatively good conditions year round .
During the rainy period of March to May , clouds tend to pile up and over the summit , dropping snow on top and rain at the base .
Visibility can be limited by cloud cover even when no rain falls .
The temperature at this time of year is relatively warm .
The dry season , beginning in late June and through July can be very cold at night , but usually is clear of clouds .
August and September are also cool and can have completely clear days , but usually a dripping cloud belt girdles the mountain above the forest and moorland .
The summit can be totally clear and the successful climber looks down on a vast sea of clouds with distant mountain peaks poking through like islands .
The shorter rainy period of October to December often has thunderstorms that pass over the mountain , dropping rain as they go .
Typically the clouds disappear in the evening , leaving nights and mornings clear with excellent visibility .
January and February are usually dry , warm and clear with brief rain showers which make for good climbing conditions .
Kilimanjaro towers above the Great Rift Valley , possible birthplace of humankind and the site of the Leakey 's research in the Olduvai Gorge .
This gives Kilimanjaro an awesome mystique .
One can imagine the mountain towering above our ancestors , making an early , continual impression on the species .
When you walk the mountain , you 'll probably encounter some odd , purposeful arrangements of stone .
Your guides will claim to not know what they mean .
Perhaps they do n't .

Damaged TAT Probes On Nine Jets While Conducting ' Security Checks '
They 're the government ... and remember , they 're here to help .
A bumbling inspector with the Transportation Safety Administration apparently has some explaining to do , after nine American Eagle regional jets were grounded at Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport on Tuesday .
Citing sources within the aviation industry , ABC News reports an overzealous TSA employee attempted to gain access to the parked aircraft by climbing up the fuselage ... reportedly using the Total Air Temperature ( TAT ) probes mounted to the planes ' noses as handholds .
" The brilliant employees used an instrument located just below the cockpit window that is critical to the operation of the onboard computers , " one pilot wrote on an American Eagle internet forum .
" They decided this instrument , the TAT probe , would be adequate to use as a ladder . "
Officials with American Eagle confirmed to ANN the problem was discovered by maintenance personnel , who inspected the planes Tuesday morning ... and questioned why the TAT probes all gave similar error indications .
One Eagle pilot says had the pilots not been so attentive , the damaged probes could have caused problems inflight .
TSA agents " are now doing things to our aircraft that may put our lives , and the lives of our passengers at risk , " the pilot wrote on the forum .
Grounding the planes to replace the TAT probes affected about 40 flights , according to American Airlines spokeswoman Mary Frances .
" We think it 's an unfortunate situation , " she told ABCNews.com .
TSA conducts routine spot inspections of aircraft parked at commercial airports , according to agency spokesman Elio Montenegro .
" Our inspector was following routine procedure for securing the aircraft that were on the tarmac , " Montenegro said , adding the inspector was attempting to determine whether someone could break into the parked planes .
Pilots respond that agents are only allowed to check for unlocked cabin doors ... a clear security risk , that could indeed compromise security .
Indeed , regional airline Mesa Air Group notes " 48 percent of all TSA investigations involving Mesa Air Group involve a failure to maintain area / aircraft security . "
It 's unclear whether that duty also allows an inspector to paw around an aircraft , however .
E - I - C Note :
This was an extraordinarily dangerous incident , folks .
The TSA has neither the mandate nor the knowledge to inspect any aircraft for any reason .
The stupidity of this matter is nearly unbelievable ... until you hear that the TSA is involved ... then it becomes understandable , though still tragic .
And I can not tell you how frustrating it is , to see them continue to hurt an indsutry that they were created to protect .
The TSA has NO BUSINESS putting untrained personnel in a position to damage aircraft .
Their bizarre games , in the name of security , do NOTHING to enhance security and do much to inhibit safety .
Aviation personnel -- pilots , A&P's , ground personnel -- are all either licensed or supervised by licensed personnel and this kind of tampering , had it been accomplished by anyone else , would have subjected that person to criminal charges .
In this case , ANN strongly recommends and encourages the criminal prosecution of this so - called inspector and his immediate supervisors ... it is a matter of time before one of these morons does something stupid and gets someone killed ... and with the way these incidents are occurring , we believe it is a virtual certainty that a TSA " Inpector " will hurt or kill someone in such a manner .
No kidding .
A few other notes ..
ANN spoke directly to the TSA PAO in this story , Elio Montenegro ... a man who desperately needs to get his stories straight .
When ANN talked to him early Tuesday evening , Montenegro first stated that no aircraft were tampered with , and thereafter attempted to minimize the issue by stating that a TSA Inspector " may have touched " the aircraft ... which American Eagle " sorta " objected to .
He claimed that there was no attempt to enter the aircraft , and when he was asked if TSA was , in fact , authorized to attempt such an entry -- out of the sight / knowledge / supervision of American Eagle personnel -- he said that he thought that I had asked a good question , did not know the answer , and promised to get back to me ... in direct conflict with other reported statements .
TSA can not keep their stories straight ... and lying to the media ... especially that part of the media that actually knows a thing or two about airplanes , was just plain foolish ... if not a deliberate attempt to mislead .
Mind you , this is the same agency that now wants to step up supervision and surveillance of the GA world .
Would you trust these kind of folks around your airplane ?
I sure do not , and will not -- and the first time that I see a TSA person attempt any interaction with any aircraft under my control , I will call the cops and do my utmost to see that person charged with a crime ...
TSA can not be trusted around Air Transport airplanes ... hell , TSA can not be trusted around GA ... and TSA has shown us little or no reason why they should be trusted , in any way , with the security of the traveling public .
We 're fed up with the incompetence of this organization ... and while it was simply ' annoying ' when they were sniffing our shoes or trying to rip off our laptops , it gets downright threatening when they start tampering with our airplanes .
Yes ... this is quite the rant and I admit to no end of frustration with this organization ... but I have to tell you , it 's time to scrap the TSA and failing that , it is WAY past time that they be SEVERELY curtailed in their ability to harm others .
Simply put , it 's time to reign in the TSA ... before they kill someone ... if they have n't already .
Rant over ... for now .

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) -
The only Guantanamo Bay inmate convicted of terrorism offences , Australian David Hicks , has broken his self - imposed silence , calling on police to relax stringent controls over his freedom since his release from jail .
Former Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks walks away from Yatala Prison with his former step mother Bronwyn Mewett in Adelaide December 29 , 2007 , after his release .

Hicks , 33 , in a video released on Thursday , said a court - imposed order imposing a midnight - to - dawn curfew , restrictions on his travel and a requirement to report to police twice a week was blocking his return to normality .
“ I do n’t know what the future holds for me .
The only thing I do know is that until the control order is lifted , I will not be able to get on with my life , ” Hicks said in the video , released through the Australian rights group GetUp !.
Hicks returned to Australia from the U.S. military prison on the island of Cuba in May last year after pleading guilty to terrorism charges .
He left prison in his hometown of Adelaide last December .
Hicks appeared largely impassive , wearing a blue open - necked shirt for his brief appearance .
He told Australians he needed “ help . ”
He was captured in Afghanistan in late 2001 and spent five years in Guantanamo before becoming the first person to be sentenced under the alternate war crimes tribunals created by the Bush administration to try non-American captives .
The former kangaroo skinner admitted training with al Qaeda and meeting its leader Osama bin Laden , whom he described as “ lovely , ” according to police evidence given to the court .
Under a plea bargain with U.S. military authorities , Hicks agreed to a gag order barring him from talking about his experiences for a year , which ended in March .
But Hicks in the video said while he would one day tell his story and explain why he joined al Qaeda and ended up in Guantanamo , he was “ still recovering from that ordeal . ”
“ I ’m not yet ready to explain what happened or why , ” he said .
He said he was worried Australian police would in February seek to extend the one - year court order , which is only the second placed on an Australian under anti-terrorism laws introduced following the September 11 attacks in the United States .
Under the order Hicks is unable to leave the country and is barred from possessing explosives , firearms or any materials related to weapons , combat skills or military tactics .
Hicks reportedly suffers from agoraphobia .
His legal team and supporters say he is receiving wide public support and offers for work , though he remains mentally fragile after Guantanamo .
GetUp ! National Director Simon Sheikh said Hicks ’s case underscored the need for a re-think on Australia ’s anti-terrorism laws , which he said compromised human rights for security .

Hello , I am 20 years old and I am currently living in Canada .
I was recently accused of sexually assaulting a woman who I had had consensual sex with .
As a means to prove my innocence it was suggested that I take a polygraph test .
I do not know the law in Canada well enough to know what the repercussions of me failing this test would be .
Furthermore I have read some of the most revealing posts in your forum so I have come to understand that I am supposed to react heavier to ' Control ' questions then I am relevant ones but I have yet to understand how I am supposed to react to irrelevant questions or are these the ones that 'll be used to measure whether I am , in the opinion of the polygraphers , being deceptive or not .
If I am not correct please explain it in laymen terms .
I really need to pass this .
This woman is accusing me of something I did not do and it is threatening to ruin my life .
Innocent ,
I do n't know the law in Canada .
However as George said a polygraph will not clear you in most cases .
It can only hurt you to voluntarily submit to one .
Contact a lawyer since the charge you face may be serious .
Taking a poly will only give the police the opp to interrogate you without an attorney .

US Democratic presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) makes a statement to the press about his campaign following a telephone conversation with his opponent , Republican Senator John McCain , in Clearwater , Florida , September 24 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
CLEARWATER , Florida ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama on Wednesday rejected opponent John McCain ’s call to postpone the first U.S. presidential debate to work on legislation dealing with the worst U.S. financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Obama made the statement shortly after McCain , a Republican senator from Arizona , called for Friday ’s debate to be postponed and said he would suspend his campaign to help work out agreement among lawmakers on a proposed $ 700 billion financial bailout plan .
“ What I ’m planning to do now is debate on Friday , ” Obama said from the hotel where he has been preparing for the debate .
“ It ’s my belief that this is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess , ” he said .
“ I think that it is going to be part of the president ’s job to deal with more than one thing at once . ”
Obama said he had told congressional leaders who are trying to hammer out an agreement on the bailout plan that he was prepared to go to Washington if it would help .
“ What is important is that we do n’t suddenly infuse Capitol Hill with presidential politics . ”
Obama said he called McCain early on Wednesday to suggest the two presidential candidates issue a joint statement aimed at taking a bipartisan approach to the bailout plan .
McCain called him back this afternoon and said he was interested in issuing a statement .
Obama said he was surprised that McCain made the announcement that he was suspending his campaign and wanted to postpone the debate .
Obama said he thought the two men would first issue the joint statement before making any other moves .
So does a listener ’s own independent reaction to a song count for anything ?
In fact , intrinsic “ quality , ” which we measured in terms of a song ’s popularity in the independent condition , did help to explain success in the social - influence condition .
When we added up downloads across all eight social - influence worlds , “ good ” songs had higher market share , on average , than “ bad ” ones .
But the impact of a listener ’s own reactions is easily overwhelmed by his or her reactions to others .
The song “ Lockdown , ” by 52 metro , for example , ranked 26th out of 48 in quality ; yet it was the No. 1 song in one social - influence world , and 40th in another .
Overall , a song in the Top 5 in terms of quality had only a 50 percent chance of finishing in the Top 5 of success .
In our artificial market , therefore , social influence played as large a role in determining the market share of successful songs as differences in quality .
It ’s a simple result to state , but it has a surprisingly deep consequence .
Because the long - run success of a song depends so sensitively on the decisions of a few early - arriving individuals , whose choices are subsequently amplified and eventually locked in by the cumulative - advantage process , and because the particular individuals who play this important role are chosen randomly and may make different decisions from one moment to the next , the resulting unpredictability is inherent to the nature of the market .
It can not be eliminated either by accumulating more information — about people or songs — or by developing fancier prediction algorithms , any more than you can repeatedly roll sixes no matter how carefully you try to throw the die .
This , obviously , presents challenges for producers and publishers — but it also has a more general significance for our understanding of how cultural markets work .
Even if you think most people are tasteless or ignorant , it ’s natural to believe that successful songs , movies , books and artists are somehow “ better , ” at least in the democratic sense of a competitive market , than their unsuccessful counterparts , that Norah Jones and Madonna deserve to be as successful as they are if only because “ that ’s what the market wanted . ”
What our results suggest , however , is that because what people like depends on what they think other people like , what the market “ wants ” at any point in time can depend very sensitively on its own history : there is no sense in which it simply “ reveals ” what people wanted all along .
In such a world , in fact , the question “ Why did X succeed ? ” may not have any better answer than the one given by the publisher of Lynne Truss ’s surprise best seller , “ Eats , Shoots & Leaves , ” who , when asked to explain its success , replied that “ it sold well because lots of people bought it . ”
This lesson is not limited to cultural products either .
Economists like Brian Arthur and Paul David have long argued that similar mechanisms affect the competition between technologies ( like operating systems or fax machines ) that display what are called “ network effects , ” meaning that the attractiveness of a technology increases with the number of people using it .
But even in markets that do n’t exhibit obvious network effects ( like markets for low - carb or organically produced food , fuel - efficient vehicles or alternative energy technologies ) , sudden shifts in consumer demand can still arise , persist and then shift again .
These shifts often come as surprises but are soon explained away as mere reflections of changing public sentiments .
Yet while in some sense these markets do reflect what people want , that is true only of what they want right now .
If markets not only reveal our preferences but also modify them , then the relation between what we want now and what we wanted before — or what we will want in the future — becomes deeply ambiguous .
Our desire to believe in an orderly universe leads us to interpret the uncertainty we feel about the future as nothing but a consequence of our current state of ignorance , to be dispelled by greater knowledge or better analysis .
But even a modest amount of randomness can play havoc with our intuitions .
Because it is always possible , after the fact , to come up with a story about why things worked out the way they did — that the first “ Harry Potter ” really was a brilliant book , even if the eight publishers who rejected it did n’t know that at the time — our belief in determinism is rarely shaken , no matter how often we are surprised .
But just because we now know that something happened does n’t imply that we could have known it was going to happen at the time , even in principle , because at the time , it was n’t necessarily going to happen at all .
That does n’t mean we should stop trying to anticipate the future , any more than we should stop trying to make sense of the past .
But it does mean that we should treat both the predictions and the explanations we are served — whether about the next hit single , the next great company or even the next war — with the skepticism they deserve .
United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379
UN General Assembly
Resolution 3379 Date November 10 1975 Meeting no .
2400 Code A / RES /3379 ( Document ) Vote For : 72 — Abs. 32 — Against : 35 Subject Elimination of all forms of racial discrimination Result Adopted and later revoked
United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 , adopted on November 10 , 1975 by a vote of 72 to 35 ( with 32 abstentions ) , " determine [d ] that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination " .
The vote took place approximately one year after UNGA 3237 granted the PLO " observer status " following Yasser Arafat 's " olive branch " speech to the General Assembly .
The resolution was passed with the support of the Soviet bloc and other then Soviet - aligned nations , in addition to the Arab and Islamic majority countries .
The resolution was revoked in 1991 with UN General Assembly Resolution 46 /86 , shortly following the end of the Cold War .
Background
In July 1920 , at San Remo conference , a Class " A " League of Nations mandates over Palestine was allocated to the British .
The preamble of the mandate document declared :
Whereas the Principal Allied Powers have also agreed that the Mandatory should be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on November 2nd , 1917 , by the Government of His Britannic Majesty , and adopted by the said Powers , in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people , it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine , or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country . [ 1 ]
On 29 November 1947 , the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending " to the United Kingdom , as the mandatory Power for Palestine , and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation , with regard to the future government of Palestine , of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union " as Resolution 181 ( II ) .
[ 2 ]
The plan contained a proposal to terminate the British Mandate for Palestine and partition Palestine into " independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem . "
On 14 May 1948 , the day on which the British Mandate over Palestine expired , the Jewish People 's Council gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum , and approved a proclamation which declared the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel , to be known as the State of Israel . [ 3 ]
On 11 May 1949 , Israel was admitted to membership in the United Nations . [ 4 ]
The position in Israel has often been compared with that in South Africa under the system of apartheid . [ 5 ]
The resolution of 1975
The full text of Resolution 3379 :
3379 ( XXX ) .
Elimination of all forms of racial discrimination The General Assembly , Recalling its resolution 1904 ( XVIII ) of 20 November 1963 , proclaiming the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , and in particular its affirmation that " any doctrine of racial differentiation or superiority is scientifically false , morally condemnable , socially unjust and dangerous " and its expression of alarm at " the manifestations of racial discrimination still in evidence in some areas in the world , some of which are imposed by certain Governments by means of legislative , administrative or other measures " , Recalling also that , in its resolution 3151 G ( XXVIII ) of 14 December 1973 , the General Assembly condemned , inter alia , the unholy alliance between South African racism and zionism , Taking note of the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace 1975 , proclaimed by the World Conference of the International Women 's Year , held at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July 1975 , which promulgated the principle that " international co-operation and peace require the achievement of national liberation and independence , the elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism , foreign occupation , zionism , apartheid and racial discrimination in all its forms , as well as the recognition of the dignity of peoples and their right to self - determination " , Taking note also of resolution 77 ( XII ) adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its twelfth ordinary session , held at Kampala from 28 July to 1 August 1975 , which considered " that the racist regime in occupied Palestine and the racist regime in Zimbabwe and South Africa have a common imperialist origin , forming a whole and having the same racist structure and being organically linked in their policy aimed at repression of the dignity and integrity of the human being " , Taking note also of the Political Declaration and Strategy to Strengthen International Peace and Security and to Intensify Solidarity and Mutual Assistance among Non-Aligned Countries , adopted at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima from 25 to 30 August 1975 , which most severely condemned zionism as a threat to world peace and security and called upon all countries to oppose this racist and imperialist ideology , Determines that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination .
Response
Israel
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly the same day , November 10 , 1975 , Israeli Ambassador Chaim Herzog stated :
" I can point with pride to the Arab ministers who have served in my government ; to the Arab deputy speaker of my Parliament ; to Arab officers and men serving of their own volition in our border and police defense forces , frequently commanding Jewish troops ; to the hundreds of thousands of Arabs from all over the Middle East crowding the cities of Israel every year ; to the thousands of Arabs from all over the Middle East coming for medical treatment to Israel ; to the peaceful coexistence which has developed ; to the fact that Arabic is an official language in Israel on a par with Hebrew ; to the fact that it is as natural for an Arab to serve in public office in Israel as it is incongruous to think of a Jew serving in any public office in an Arab country , indeed being admitted to many of them .
Is that racism ?
It is not !
That ... is Zionism . "
In his response he also said that the resolution was :
" another manifestation of the bitter anti-Semitic , anti-Jewish hatred which animates Arab society .
Who would have believed that in this year , 1975 , the malicious falsehoods of the ' Elders of Zion ' would be distributed officially by Arab governments ?
Who would have believed that we would today contemplate an Arab society which teaches the vilest anti-Jewish hate in the kindergartens ?...
We are being attacked by a society which is motivated by the most extreme form of racism known in the world today "
Herzog ended his statement , while holding a copy of the resolution , with these words :
" For us , the Jewish people , this resolution based on hatred , falsehood and arrogance , is devoid of any moral or legal value .
For us , the Jewish people , this is no more than a piece of paper and we shall treat it as such . "
As he concluded his speech , Herzog tore the resolution in half .
The name of " The UN avenue " in Haifa , Jerusalem and Tel Aviv was switched to " The Zionism avenue " as a response to the UN 's decision . [ 6 ]
United States
Before the vote , Daniel Patrick Moynihan , the United States ambassador to the United Nations , warned that , " The United Nations is about to make anti-Semitism international law . " [ 7 ]
He delivered a passionate speech against the resolution , including the famous line , " The [ United States ] does not acknowledge , it will not abide by it , will never acquiesce in this infamous act …
A great evil has been loosed upon the world . " [ 8 ]
In Campbell , California , in the United States , a group of high school students attempted to solicit signatures on the premises of a local shopping center for a petition against Resolution 3379 .
The result was the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins ( 1980 ) that supported states ' rights to expand the exercise of free speech , which California held was legal in what were considered public areas of a shopping mall .[ citation needed ]
Mexico's vote in favor of the resolution led some United States Jews to organize a tourism boycott of Mexico .
This ended after Mexican foreign minister Emilio Óscar Rabasa made a trip to Israel ( Rabasa shortly afterward was forced to resign ) . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
Revocation
Following the end of the Cold War , Resolution 3379 was revoked in December 1991 with UN General Assembly Resolution 46/86 . [ 11 ]
Israel had made the revocation a condition of its participation in the Madrid Peace Conference of 1991 . [ 12 ]

Let ’s say you ’re three auto industry executives summoned to Washington to explain why you deserve billions of dollars in taxpayer money .
You and your cronies have mismanaged your industry for years , but luckily for you and unluckily for the country too many parts of the economy rely on your continued existence .
You watched AIG executives get strafed in the media for throwing lavish corporate retreats ( with spa trips ! ) just after taking bailout funds .
You know the public is hyper - sensitive to signs of waste , because middle class Americans are struggling to get by and it ’s their money you ’re seeking .
So what do you do ?
You take separate private jets from Detroit to Washington .
You take three flights at an estimated cost of $ 20,000 each , despite the fact that coach flights are available for under $ 300 and first class flights are available for under $ 1,000 .
You spend $ 60,000 when you could have spent $ 900 .
And then you go to Congress with your hand out .
Jesus H. Christ .
Bailout funds for the industry should be contingent on new leadership taking over and old leadership being put in stocks .

BERNARD MADOFF worked as a lifeguard to earn enough money to start his own securities firm .
Almost half a century later , the colossal Ponzi scheme into which it mutated has proved impossible to keep afloat — unlike Mr Madoff 's 55 - foot fishing boat , “ Bull ” .
The $ 17.1 billion that Mr Madoff claimed to have under management earlier this year is all but gone .
His alleged confession that the fraud could top $ 50 billion looks increasingly plausible : clients have admitted to exposures amounting to more than half that .
On December 16th the head of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation , which is recovering what it can for investors , said the multiple sets of accounts kept by the 70 - year - old were in “ complete disarray ” and could take six months to sort out .
It is hard to imagine a more apt end to Wall Street 's worst year in decades .
The known list of victims grows longer and more star - studded by the day .
Among them are prominent billionaires , including Steven Spielberg ; the owner of the New York Mets baseball team ; Carl Shapiro , a nonagenarian clothing magnate who may have lost $ 545 m ; thousands of wealthy retirees ; and a cluster of mostly Jewish charities , some of which face closure .
Dozens of supposedly sophisticated financial firms were caught out too , including banks such as Santander and HSBC , and Fairfield Greenwich , an alternative - investment specialist that had funnelled no less than $ 7.5 billion to Mr Madoff .
Though his operation resembled a hedge - fund shop , he was in fact managing client money in brokerage accounts within his firm , seemingly as Merrill Lynch or Smith Barney would .
A lot of this came from funds of funds , which invest in pools of hedge funds , and was channelled to Mr Madoff via “ feeder funds ” with which he had special relationships .
Some banks , such as the Dutch arm of Fortis , lent heavily to funds of funds that wanted to invest .
On the face of it , the attractions were clear .
Mr Madoff 's pedigree was top - notch : a pioneering marketmaker , he had chaired NASDAQ , had advised the government on market issues and was a noted philanthropist .
Turning away some investors and telling those he accepted not to talk to outsiders produced a sense of exclusivity .
He generated returns to match : in the vicinity of 10 % a year , through thick and thin .
Charming , but far too smooth
That last attraction should also have served as a warning ; the results were suspiciously smooth .
Mr Madoff barely ever suffered a down month , even in choppy markets ( he was up in November , as the S&P index tumbled 7.5 % ) .
He allegedly has now confessed that this was achieved by creating a pyramid scheme in which existing clients ' returns were topped up , as needed , with money from new investors .
He claimed to be employing an investment strategy known as “ split - strike conversion ” .
This is a fairly common approach that entails buying and selling different sorts of options to reduce volatility .
But those who bothered to look closely had doubts .
Aksia , an advisory firm , concluded that the S&P 100 options market that Mr Madoff claimed to trade was far too small to handle a portfolio of his size .
It advised its clients not to invest .
So did MPI , a quantitative - research firm , after an analysis in 2006 failed to find a legitimate strategy that matched his returns — though they were closely correlated with those of Bayou , a fraudulent hedge fund that had collapsed a year earlier .
This was not the only danger signal .
Stock holdings were liquidated every quarter , presumably to avoid reporting big positions .
For a godfather of electronic trading , Mr Madoff ran the business along antediluvian lines : clients and feeder - fund managers were denied online access to their accounts .
Even more worryingly , he cleared his own trades , with no external custodian .
They were audited , of course , but by a tiny firm with three employees , one of whom was a secretary and another an 80 - year - old based in Florida .
Perhaps the biggest warning sign was the secrecy with which the investment business was conducted .
It was a black box , run by a tiny team at a very long arm 's length from the group 's much bigger broker - dealer .
Clients too were kept in the dark .
They seemed not to mind as long as the returns remained strong , accepting that to ask Bernie to reveal his strategy would be as crass as demanding to see Coca - Cola 's magic formula .
Mr Madoff reinforced the message by occasionally ejecting a client who asked awkward questions .
The trading business was hardly pristine either .
It had been probed for front - running ( trading for its own account before filling client orders ) and separately found guilty of technical violations .
Some clients reportedly suspected that Mr Madoff was engaged in wrongdoing , but not the sort that would endanger their money .
They thought he might be trading illegally for their benefit on information gleaned by his marketmaking arm .
This failure of due diligence by so many funds of funds will deal the industry a blow .
They are paid to screen managers , to pick the best and to diversify clients ' holdings — none of which they did properly in this case .
Some investors are understandably irate that their funds — including one run by the chairman of GMAC , a troubled car - loan firm — charged above - average fees , only to plonk the bulk of their cash in Mr Madoff 's lap .
This is the last thing hedge funds need , plagued as they are by a wave of redemption requests .
Financial firms that dealt with Mr Madoff are bracing themselves for a wave of litigation as individual victims go after those with deep pockets .
Hedge funds will also face pressure to accept further oversight .
But the affair shows the need for the government to enforce its rules better , rather than write new ones , argues Robert Van Grover of Seward & Kissel , a law firm .
Mr Madoff 's investment business was overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , but it failed to carry out any examinations despite receiving complaints from investors and rivals since as long ago as the late 1990s .
As a Wall Street fixture , Mr Madoff was close to several SEC officials .
His niece , the firm 's compliance lawyer , even married a former member of the team that had inspected the marketmaking division 's books in 2003 — though there is no evidence of impropriety .
In a rare mea culpa , Christopher Cox , the SEC 's chairman , has called its handling of the case “ deeply troubling ” and promised an investigation of its “ multiple failures ” .
Having already been lambasted for fiddling while investment banks burned , the commission is now likelier than ever to be restructured , or perhaps even dismantled , in the regulatory overhaul expected under Barack Obama .
As The Economist went to press Mr Obama was expected to name Mary Schapiro , an experienced brokerage regulator , to replace Mr Cox .
The rules themselves will need changing , too .
All investment managers , not just mutual funds , could now be forced to use external clearing agents to ensure third - party scrutiny , says Larry Harris of the University of Southern California 's Marshall School of Business .
Regulation of financial firms ' accountants may also need tightening .
And more could be done to encourage whistle - blowing .
Mr Madoff claims to have acted alone .
But given the huge amount of paperwork required to keep his scam going , it seems unlikely that no one else knew about it .
Above all , however , investors need to help themselves .
This pyramid scheme may have been unprecedented , but the lessons are old ones : spread your eggs around and , as Mr Harris puts it , “ investigate your good stories as well as your bad ones . ”
This is particularly true of money managers who work deep in the shadows or seem beyond reproach — even more so during booms , when the temptation to swindle grows along with the propensity to speculate .
There will always be “ sheep to be shorn ” , as Charles Kindleberger memorably wrote in “ Manias , Panics and Crashes ” .
Let us hope they never again line up in such numbers .

Red flags investigated in this blog are often reported to appropriate government agencies as a whistleblower .

Looks like that turnaround plan may take a while longer to , well , turn things around .
EMI losses more than doubled in the year Terra Firma took over ; from £ 287 m in the year to March 30 , down to £ 757 million .
More worrying - though Terra Firma forecast 51 % digital revenue growth in the recorded music division , it only got 29 % , with digital sales themselves up 19 % to £ 166 million .
In the publishing division , digital income was up from £ 25.2 million to just £ 27.5 million .
In fairness , what chairman John Birt calls " continuing underperformance " is , in part , down to restructuring costs and revaluation of the business - but the ex BBC director general acknowledged some folk reading his annual report statement " may well be struck by the forthright presentation of problems and the absence of rosy assurances about the future " .
Indeed , he looked back on the mess Terra inherited with plenty of honesty and resentment .
Here 's what EMI 's digital cock - ups have been , according to Birt …
• Missing figures :
When Terra took over last year , EMI was n't even keeping comprehensive figures on digital sales , Birt said : " One of the reasons EMI Music was losing customers was that it had limited information on the changing tastes and buying behaviour of customers , particularly those buying through new digital channels .
There was also insufficient information to be able to get an accurate picture of how unprofitable to EMI many individual artists were . "
• Digital underperformance : " Research conducted post - acquisition showed that EMI Music 's digital sales had grown more slowly than the digital market ( overall ) : only 115 % between 2005 and 2007 against market growth in the same period of 148 % . "
• Anti-social : " In 2007 , ( EMI ) still lacked any relationship with the social networking sites that were becoming an important route to market . "
It 's own corporate commitment to digital was merely " limited ... a strategic group disconnected from the main technology workforce across the company " .
• Slow to digitise : " EMI Music has not yet fully digitised more than a moderate percentage of its catalogue .
Even today , only around 30 to 35 % of the part of the catalogue in CD format is available for downloading . "
For next year , Birt forecast " significant improvement " , planning on cutting 1,500 jobs and up to £ 100 million costs by year 's end , as well as getting on top of the reporting paperwork .

But , politics is about interest group influences .
If economic interest groups are eliminated , only ideological groups are left - right and left groups driven by cultural , ethnic , environmental or other religious values .
Is that world likely to prove more tolerant , more compassionate , more " concerned ? "
That liberals wish libertarians to go away is , perhaps , not surprising .
But the issue is much more serious than even Jonah Goldberg realizes .
McCain 's championing of " getting the monied interests out of politics " and Obama 's pledge to eliminate their influence both amount to an attempt to eliminate economic interest groups ( and , indeed , interest groups that are in any way allied with economic interests - such as independent free market groups ) from politics .
But , politics is about interest group influences .
If economic interest groups are eliminated , only ideological groups are left - right and left groups driven by cultural , ethnic , environmental or other religious values .
Is that world likely to prove more tolerant , more compassionate , more " concerned ? "
My personal vision of the future is to find myself about to testify in Congress on some creative expansion of the state .
As I 'm about to testify , the chairman speaks up : " Mr. Smith , before you begin , I have a question I 'd like you to answer .
Are you now or have you ever been associated with the wealth producing sector of the United States ? "
A world where economic interests are disenfranchised - indeed , even de-legitimized - is a world that will have little regard for economic - and , thus , indivdiual - liberty .
Ideologues have created far more horrors than have even the most rampant of business villains .
My understanding is that Stalin , Hitler , Pol Pot and Mao Tse Tung were not motivated by profits .
We ’re signing off now .
You can follow the results through the rest of the morning at the Times ’s election result page .
Looks like Senator Ted Stevens has an early lead over his Democratic challenger , Mark Begich , in Alaska ; with 37 percent of the precincts reporting , Stevens was up 49 percent to 45 .
Minnesota and Oregon were neck and neck .
With more than three - fourths of the precincts reporting in Minnesota , the two major - party candidates remained neck and neck .
Dean Barkley , the Independence Party candidate , was drawing away nearly 16 percent — possibly hurting Al Franken , the Democratic challenger , more than the incumbent Republican , Norm Coleman .
Oregon remains too close to call .
Georgia , on the other hand , may — just may — be averting a runoff ; it appears as if Saxby Chambliss will capture more than 50 percent .
The results of the Alaska race involving Ted Stevens , convicted last month on seven felony counts , will be known much later .
So if the Democrats take Oregon , that will give them six formerly Republican seats , still shy of the 60 votes .
Senator Mary Landrieu pulled off a win tonight , after several months of combating a fairly strong challenge from Mr. Kennedy , the Republican .
In other Senate races , Georgia Republican Saxby Chambliss appeared to have fended off what had seemed a growing threat in recent weeks from Jim Martin , the Democrat .
The returns were still coming in , and remember this state requires a win by majority vote , meaning there could still be a runoff .
What ’s happening in Minnesota ????
It ’s still too close to call , as is Oregon , although it had appeared earlier that Senator Gordon Smith was extremely close to losing his seat .
The Republican leadership in the House seems to be crumbling a bit tonight .
Roll Call reports that Representative Adam Putnam of Florida fired off a letter tonight , resigning from his post as head of the Republican Leadership Conference .
While we ’re pacing and watching for solid results in a few critical races , we thought we ’d return to a question that certainly will rumble through the Senate after the McCain - Palin loss tonight .
What happens to Mr. McCain ’s sidekick , Senator Joseph Lieberman , former Democrat - turned - independent turned , um , huge backer and campaigner on the Republican trail ?
If the Democrats do n’t need Mr. Lieberman because they ca n’t get to 60 votes anyway , will Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid take action against him ?
Lieberman , the Connecticut senator who was the Democrats ’ vice - presidential nominee in 2000 , remains chairman of the Homeland Security Committee , and some of his critics have demanded that Mr. Reid strip him of the top committee post .
Mr. Lieberman had already stopped attending Democratic caucus meetings on his own .
We ’ll have to see .
Perhaps Mr. Lieberman ’s votes — he often sides with Democrats on issues other than the Iraq war — will still be needed .
Our Los Angeles bureau chief , Jennifer Steinhauer , sends this along from Las Vegas :
While Nevada was just called for Senator Obama — a remarkable event for this usually reliable red state — voters here are waiting for the outcome of the state ’s three Congressional races , where one Democratic incumbent is safe and two Republican incumbents are in tough battles to hold their seats , with a minority of precincts reporting .
In the north , incumbent Republican Dean Heller is holding his own against Jill Derby , the underdog in a historically Republican stronghold in the second congressional district .
In the south , in the suburbs of Las Vegas , Republican Jon Porter remained locked in a dead heat with Dina Titus in the third CD .
In the small first congressional district , which encompasses the city of Las Vegas , incumbent Democrat Shelley Berkley is expected to win re-election by a wide margin .
The polls have closed in Oregon , and we ’re still waiting to see the outcome of the contest between Republican Senator Gordon Smith and Jeff Merkley , the first Democratic speaker of the Oregon House .
Mr. Smith is seeking his third term , but the tide of Obama support in the state may have flooded down the ballot .
So where do we stand ?
So far , it appears that the Democrats have picked up five Senate seats — New Hampshire , North Carolina , New Mexico ( Pete Domenici ’s seat — he departed after six terms ) , Virginia and Colorado .
Still , other Senate seats seem securely in Republican hands .
The duel to retain the Republican reign following Trent Lott ’s decision to retire in Mississippi seems to be favoring Roger Wicker , a former congressman , over former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove , the Democrat .
Mr. Wicker was appointed at the end of 2007 , when Mr. Lott stepped down .
The state ’s other senator , Thad Cochran , was re-elected handily .
So , at this point , even without knowing the outcome of the Minnesota race , or that of Georgia , the Democrats ’ chances of getting to a 60 - vote majority seem a little implausible .
Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu is in a fairly close race with John Kennedy , a former Democrat - turned - Republican .
Earlier this year , Republicans considered Senator Landrieu to be among the most vulnerable of Democratic incumbents , in part because Mr. Kennedy was well known in the state .
But she battled back with a barrage of ads .
Still in flux was the influence on the race , as the Times - Picayune reported a while ago , of the returns from Orleans Parish , which were rich with Landrieu supporters .
Still out , as well , with too few precincts reporting , is the Minnesota race between Senator Norm Coleman , the Republican , and his Democratic challenger , Al Franken .
Alaska wo n’t be known for a long while , either ; polls close at midnight Eastern time .
Safe Race Seats :
While we wait on some of the closer Senate and House races that have n’t been called , there are few updates along the way .
Senator John Kerry , Democrat of Massachusetts and the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee , handily won re-election .
Projections indicate that Mark Udall , the Democrat running against Bob Schaffer for Colorado ’s open Senate seat , will assume the seat being vacated by Republican Wayne Allard .
Republicans had tried to paint Mr. Udall as a Boulder liberal , but Mr. Schaffer seemed to lose more ground in the late summer .
After spending some time tooling around parts of the state last week , we were told by many people in Virginia that the presidential race would be close , maybe 4 to 5 points apart .
And with so many new voters on the rolls , it seemed that some of the House races might draw closer , too .
According to The Associated Press , Virgil H. Goode retained his Republican seat after a fierce battle with his Democratic opponent , Tom Perriello , who was fueled by funds from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
But it was tight .
We ’re still waiting to see how another Republican , Thelma Drake , will do , in Virginia ’s 2nd CD .
One of the most endangered Democrats , Carol Shea Porter , who was among those Granite State surprise winners two years ago , appears to be hanging on tonight in a rematch against Republican Jeb Bradley .
Our colleague Carl Hulse reminds us that this bodes well for the Democrats , who are holding their House seats , while the Republicans may be losing some of theirs .
If Chris Shays of Connecticut loses , which is possible , that would leave New England without a single House Republican .
CNN is projecting that Tom Udall , the Democrat , is the winner in New Mexico over Republican Steve Pearce .
Added to Warner , Hagan and Shaheen , that makes four Democratic pickups .
Mr. Udall ’s cousin , Mark Udall , has his own race in Colorado , which still has n’t been called .
The Udalls have a rich history in the West .
Their fathers —
Tom ’s ( Stuart ) and Mark ’s ( Morris ) — were legendary .
CNN projects that Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , who battled mightily against his challenger , Bruce Lunsford , a businessman , will survive and be re-elected .
Mr. McConnell poured extra money into his campaign in recent weeks and stumped throughout the state , even as he was hammered for his leadership on the economic bailout .
But imagine being the minority leader with an even smaller minority .
Some may consider the turnover from red to blue in North Carolina ’s Senate race a harbinger for the top of the ballot .
The state ’s early voters showed a higher percentage of African - Americans than their overall portion of the electorate , and they tend to vote Democratic .
But Senator Dole , who once made a bid for her party ’s presidential nomination , seemed at times early on to have taken her re-election for granted .
She was n’t campaigning that hard or investing that much time on the stump earlier this year , at a time when the Obama campaign moved in with its sophisticated registration drive and ground game .
In addition , the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee began giving Ms. Hagan an enormous lift with a series of campaign ads .
Some of them were quite artful , questioning Mrs.
Dole ’s real residence , or , as in this one depicting two men rocking on a porch asking whether she should n’t be the senator from China as all the jobs went overseas .
Some projections are showing that longtime Representative Tom Feeney , a Republican , may be losing to his Democratic challenger , Suzanne Kosmas in Florida .
She racked up early leads as the returns were coming for the 24th CD that covers Titusville and New Smyrna Beach .
She is a former state legislator whose used the airwaves in a well - financed campaign to hammer away at Mr. Feeney , the veteran lawmaker .
Mr. Feeney was among those lawmakers who went on a golfing spree with Jack Abramoff , the disgraced ( and now imprisoned ) lobbyist .
The Florida congressman ’s trip was to Scotland .
Remember Larry Craig of the “ wide stance ” at the Minneapolis - St.
Paul airport last year ?
Mr. Craig ’s seat was always considered a safely Republican one , and it appears more than likely that Lt. Gov. Jim Risch will inherit the solidly red slot .
The Times calls the North Carolina Senate race for Kay Hagan .
Our colleague Sarah Wheaton caught up with Dalton Hatfield ( remember him ? ) , who became the darling of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s run for president when he sold his bike to contribute to her campaign .
With a day off from his sixth - grade classes in McAndrews , Ky. , Dalton has been working for Bruce Lunsford , a Democrat , in a competitive race to unseat Senator Mitch McConnell , the minority leader .
“ We ’re very confident , ” Dalton , now 12 , told Sarah .
He said he “ was not that excited ” after Mrs. Clinton withdrew from the race , but he got involved in the Lunsford campaign after she invited him to join her at a Lunsford rally .
Since then , he ’s been canvassing and putting up signs .
The Times calls the New Hampshire Senate race for Jeanne Shaheen , adding yet another seat to the Democratic column .
In a closely contested Senate race between two old foes in New Hampshire , NBC is calling a victory for former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen over Senator John E. Sununu , a moderate Republican .
And Fox News projects that Kay Hagan will beat Senator Elizabeth Dole in North Carolina .
In Maine , Susan Collins won re-election , despite a few moments there earlier this summer when her challenger , Tom Allen , tried to wrest the seat from her .
And in South Carolina , Lindsey Graham , longtime Republican and stalwart campaign supporter of Senator John McCain , won re-election .
The McConnell race : Even though Kentucky went red for Senator John McCain , as expected , in the presidential race , we wo n’t be calling the Senate race there anytime soon because there are no exit polls , too few precincts are reporting and it was considered a close matchup heading in to today .
In other races in Virginia , ( besides the big one for president ) , there are two other House seats we want to watch : Republican Thelma Drake ’s in the 2nd CD and the 11th CD seat being vacated by Representative Tom Davis , a Republican who is retiring .
In a profile by Peter Baker awhile back , Mr. Davis — who was ushered in 14 years ago during the Gingrich era — expressed his dissatisfaction with his party ’s label under Mr. Bush .
Mr. Baker wrote :
The revolution is over , the thrill is gone and the Republican brand under President Bush has , in Davis ’s view , been so tarnished that , as he likes to say , “ if we were a dog food , they would take us off the shelf . ”
These will be Davis ’s last few weeks in Congress .
He decided against re-election , disaffected by the partisanship , by a process he calls broken , by a party he considers hijacked by social conservatives .
“ We ’re just not getting much done , ” he said .
No Surprise Here : The Times has just called Virginia ’s Senate race for Mark Warner , the former governor .
Exchanging one Warner for another , so to speak , although the two hold very different views .
Mark Warner had very little competition from former Republican governor Jim Gilmore , who in the early part of the presidential primary season tried to wade through the thick field of G.O.P. contenders but dropped out early .
Great Anticipation | 6:35 p.m .
Get ready for a rush of news tonight on the congressional front , which promises cliffhangers in some Senate races , including a possible runoff in the deep South , as well as an anticipated rout of Republicans in formerly G.O.P. - safe districts .
While we do n’t want to be predictive , we already know that the tightening of some Senate races – reaching even the longtime Kentucky seat of Minority leader Mitch McConnell — will make for an exciting night .
( And by the way , Kentucky ’s polls closed at 6 p.m. , so we may know more about his contest against Democratic challenger Bruce Lunsford sooner rather than later . )
Fanning out across the country , what ’s at issue tonight is no less than a broadening of the majority in the Senate for the Democrats , who now hold a narrow 51 - 49 lead .
That seems certain , given that the Republicans have to defend 23 of the 35 seats up this year in a climate unparalleled in recent memory .
President Bush ’s unpopularity had been a worry - vane for members of his party facing re-election long before the economic meltdown this fall .
The question tonight is :
By how much and by how many seats will the Democratic tide rise ?
All eyes will be watching to see if the Democrats can reach a 60 - seat majority that would be , as our dear mentor and former colleague Adam Clymer would prefer we call it , a “ filibuster - resistant majority . ”
If the Democrats reach 60 , they would be better able to thwart Republicans ’ efforts to block legislation by filibuster , a tactic they have employed frequently the last two years .
Senator Chuck Schumer , Democrat of New York and chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , has stopped short of declaring that Democrats will reach the magic number , but some signs point that they ’ll come fairly close .
The Republicans , led by Senator John Ensign , the head of the party ’s Senate election arm , have been struggling to stave off substantial losses .
At one point last summer , Mr. Ensign told a group of us that if they could keep their losses to four seats , that would be a good night .
While it ’s not clear that their opponents will meet the 60 - seat hurdle , it ’s fairly apparent that the Republicans will lose more than four .
The National Republican Senatorial Committee is keeping score at its own Web site .
In both House and Senate races , in state after state , the foreclosure rates , the financial downturn , the earlier spike in gasoline prices , all turned into a groundswell of unhappiness with anything associated with the Bush administration , including his party ’s followers .
By contrast , the 2006 mid-term elections felled many Republican incumbents in the House , who were tarnished by the Abramoff lobbying and the page scandals ( in seats in Ohio , Florida and elsewhere ) , while opposition to the war in Iraq helped elect their Democratic opponents .
This year , the war subsided over time as an overarching issue , only to be replaced by the economic crisis and the $ 700 billion bailout .
We ’ll be live blogging updates and results in critical Senate races and some of the most competitive House races ( all 435 seats are up ) throughout the evening , and using Twitter at times to telegraph our thoughts .
In addition , we have a series of maps and dashboard graphics where you can watch the returns in real time , and map out your own game plans , depending on who ’s winning where as the returns come in .
For the Senate , the Big Board page ;
and the Senate map page .
For the House of Representatives , the Big Board and the House map page .
For the presidential race , my colleague Katharine Q. Seelye will be live blogging the main event , and you can watch the returns or view what ’s going on through the presidential map .
Here ’s a breakdown of some of the most competitive Senate seats , or in some instances , simply interesting ones :
Georgia
Wow , did this race turn downward for the incumbent Republican , Saxby Chambliss , within the fall season .
Buffeted by the ill economic winds , and an extraordinary early voter turnout among African - Americans , Mr. Chambliss has lost what once seemed a sure re-election bid .
His opponent , Jim Martin , has made significant gains in recent weeks , and this race is quite possibly going to spill over into runoff territory .
Georgia law requires a runoff , which would be held on Dec. 2 if neither candidate gets a majority of more than 50 percent .
My colleague Carl Hulse examined the consequences of a runoff , and the forces driving the close contest , just a few days ago .
New Hampshire : Senator John Sununu , a moderate Republican , has been defending one of the hottest seats going this year , in his re-election fight with former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen , the Democrat .
Two years ago , Democrats captured the House seats here , upending a tradition of Republican congressmen in this wildly independent state .
My colleague David Herszenhorn , has been closely following this rematch between two bitter rivals in our “ Hot Seat ” series .
His latest dispatch on Saturday signaled how vulnerable Mr. Sununu may be .
Virginia :
What a difference a few years makes .
In 2006 , the Virginia seat that gave Democrats the razor - line edge in the Senate was the last one decided , remember ?
The incumbent George Allen , of “ macaca - fame ” was n’t down by much and did n’t concede on election night as his challenger , Jim Webb , waited and waited .
Now , with the state ’s elder statesman , the longtime veteran John Warner retiring at age 81 after five terms , the open seat has been one Democrat ’s for the taking .
Former Gov. Mark Warner ( no relation ) has raced so far ahead of his Republican opponent , Jim Gilmore ( another of the state ’s governors ) , from the get - go that you wo n’t need exit polls or a rising tide of blue votes in the state to call that one .
The only question for Mr. Warner will be a win by how much ?
North Carolina : Senator Elizabeth Dole , who was elected just six years ago , has faced a surprisingly rough re-election battle with some polls now indicating she may lose .
First , Democrats went after her for not spending much time in her home state , with an address at the Watergate .
Then in this last week , Mrs. Dole began broadcasting ads titled “ Godless ” against her opponent , Kay Hagan , stemming from a fund - raiser the Democrat attended that was sponsored by a group of atheists .
The Dole ads were roundly criticized , and viewed as a desperate move against her opponent , who also teaches Sunday school .
Minnesota :
Few races have been as downright nasty – or as flush with personal attacks — as the contest between incumbent Republican Norman Coleman and Democrat Al Franken .
In their final debate on Sunday night , the moderator called it the most negative in Minnesota history .
Mr. Franken painted his opponent as allied with Mr. Bush at every turn , while the Republicans repeatedly hammered the Democratic comedian - turned - serious candidate for writings that were considered offensive and his failure to pay several years of taxes .
Ad after ad in this race took on the purchase of men ’s suits or the derogatory language used by Mr. Franken .
Mr. Coleman had been under fire for several years from more liberal constituencies because of his support for the Iraq war .
Complicating the results in this contest is the candidacy of Dean Barkley , the Independence Party candidate , whose popularity in the polls has sometimes reached double - digits .
Alaska :
By any stretch of the imagination , this race should ’ve been cooked once Senator Ted Stevens , 84 , was convicted two weeks ago in a public corruption case .
Even before the trial , the longtime senator had been in a close race with Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich , the Democratic challenger .
But Mr. Stevens vowed to fight on , calling his trial unjust despite the fact that Minority leader McConnell , Senator John McCain and others called for him to step aside .
This week Mr. Stevens put up a two - minute commercial appealing to voters , and still has broad support in his home state after seven terms .
But the criminal case — coupled with other sprawling corruption inquiries that have ensnared several Alaska politicians has to be wearying for voters .
Oregon Another Republican incumbent with a rather moderate record , Senator Gordon Smith , also has watched his chances for re-election grow slimmer as his opponent , Jeff Merkley , gained ground .
National Democrats targeted this race , another one in which ties to the Bush administration and its policies wafted across the state ’s landscape .
Mr. Merkley seems sure to benefit from the Obama - wave sweeping the state .
This is the only state where Mr. Obama did an advertisement for a Senate candidate this year , one that was unveiled early last week as the state ’s vote - by - mail only system reached its peak .
The House Democratic leaders say they expect to pick up somewhere between 20 and 30 seats tonight .
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has out - raised and outspent its Republican counterpart in a cycle that has spelled trouble for many G.O.P. incumbents .
The DCCC spent $ 73 million , against the NRCC ’s R20 million through last week , according to recent reports .
Some seats we ’ll be watching tonight , as outlined by Carl Hulse in a piece about how deeply into red territory the Democrats were going as they smelled blood in state after state .
Among open House seats Democrats say they have a good chance of capturing include those being vacated by Representatives Ralph Regula and Deborah Pryce in Ohio , Jim Ramstad in Minnesota , Jerry Weller in Illinois and Rick Renzi in Arizona .
On the list of incumbents Democrats believe they can defeat are Representatives John R. Kuhl Jr. in New York , Joe Knollenberg in Michigan , Tom Feeney and Ric Keller in Florida , Don Young in Alaska , Robin Hayes in North Carolina and Bill Sali in Idaho .
Among other House races we ’re watching :
In Pennsylvania , the ever - outspoken Jack Murtha , a Democrat , infuriated many constituents a few weeks ago by calling his region racist .
In Florida , scandal again dogs the 16th Congressional District , where Mark Foley ’s page imbroglio in 2006 spelled trouble for several of his G.O.P. colleagues in other parts of the country .
This time around , his Democratic successor Tim Mahoney , is involved in his own scandals involving extramarital affair (s ) , with questions about money that was paid to one of them .
Special thanks for Congressional race coverage goes to Carl Hulse and David Herszenhorn .
I am an atheist who dismisses the concept of gods as incomprehensible and lacking in evidence .
I also believe that the natural world is all that exists and find great joy , beauty , and meaning in this world .
This post continues the What I Believe series by examining my belief that living in reality ( i.e. , the natural world ) is preferable to living in fantasy or delusion .
While I suspect that this statement of belief will not be controversial to most readers , that does not mean that it should be accepted uncritically .
Reality is Both Natural and Objective
I previously stated that " reality " refers to to the natural world and only to the natural world .
Gods and other supernatural entities are not part of the natural world by definition , and this excludes them from reality itself .
Beyond this , I believe that there is such a thing as objective reality .
I mean this in the sense that there is an independent reality which exists outside of human consciousness .
Just because I cannot see the tree with my eyes closed does not mean that the tree ceases to exist .
This is not to say that our subjective experience of reality is not important .
However , I believe that using phrases such as " subjective reality " or discussing " multiple realities " introduces unnecessary confusion .
Our subjective experience of reality is vital , but it is no suitable replacement for reality itself .
I can agree with the postmodern view that people construct their own realities only up to a point .
That point is where subjective experience of reality is equated with reality itself or where objective reality is actually denied .
This is a form of mental masturbation with which I will not go along .
Connection to Reality is Healthy
Psychosis is recognized in virtually all circles as involving a break with reality .
That is , a psychotic person can no longer distinguish between reality and fantasy .
Psychotic individuals are viewed as ill and deserving of treatment in all cultures ( although treatments certainly vary ) .
Thus , an important sign of mental health involves one 's connection to reality .
Part of what distinguishes psychosis from other forms of indulgence in fantasy is the degree of voluntary control the individual retains .
A truly psychotic person cannot distinguish between reality and fantasy and is thus unable to control his / her behavior with reference to reality .
This is quite different from daydreams where one knows what is real and what is fantasy and can intentionally alternate between them .
But Fantasy Feels Good
Much like drugs , fantasy does feel good .
However , just like drugs , too much indulgence is unhealthy .
The daydreamer , superstitious person , or religious believer knows ( or can know with a little effort ) the falsehood of his / her beliefs .
This does not stop the beliefs from feeling good or even from having some short - term benefits .
However , there is a clear long - term danger .
Much like drugs , prolonged indulgence in fantasy leads to suffering in reality .
For example , the individual may ignore real - world problems by focusing on an afterlife .
Also like drugs , the worse one 's real life becomes , the more tempting it is to retreat to fantasy .
While temporary use of fantasy can be beneficial , learning to live in our natural , objective reality is far more healthy in the long run .
By living in reality , we are better able to adapt to and change our environments .
By confronting real sources of unhappiness , we are better able to cope .
But What Does it Mean to Live in Reality ?
Simply put , learning to live in reality involves the exercise of reason and critical thinking to examine and modify one 's beliefs .
Beliefs are based on the application of reason , implying some degree of fluidity .
New information with relevance to one 's beliefs is actively sought , evaluated , and used to change one 's beliefs .
For example , my belief about the possible deterrent effect of capital punishment is based on scientific data which I have sought out and evaluated .
Should new information emerge , my belief may change .
There are several different flavors of Machine Learning classes .
Many classes are of the ‘ zoo ’ sort : many different learning algorithms are presented .
Others avoid the zoo by not covering the full scope of machine learning .
This is my view of what makes a good machine learning class , along with why .
I ’d like to specifically invite comment on whether things are missing , misemphasized , or misplaced .
Phase Subject Why ?
Introduction
What is a machine learning problem ?
A good understanding of the characteristics of machine learning problems seems essential .
Characteristics include : a data source , some hope the data is predictive , and a need for generalization .
This is probably best taught in a case study manner : lay out the specifics of some problem and then ask “ Is this a machine learning problem ? ” Introduction Machine Learning Problem Identification Identification and recognition of the type of learning problems is ( obviously ) a very important step in solving such problems .
People need to be familiar witth the concept of ‘ regression ’ , ‘ classification ’ , ‘ cost sensitive classification ’ , ‘ reinforcement learning ’ , etc … A good organization of these things is possible , but not yet well done .
Introduction Example algorithm 1
To really understand machine learning , a couple learning algorithms must be understood in detail .
Introduction Example algorithm 2 Ditto .
The reason why the number is “ 2 ” and not “ 1 ” or “ 3 ” is that 2 is the minimum number required to make people naturally aware of the degrees of freedom available in learning algorithm design .
Analysis Bias for Learning
The need for a good bias is one of the defining characteristics of learning .
This includes discussing the means to specify bias ( via Bayesian priors , choice of features , graphical models , etc… ) .
This statement is generic so it will always apply to one degree or another .
Analysis Learning can be boosted .
This is the boosting observation : that it is possible to bootstrap predictive ability to create a better overall system .
This statement is similarly generic .
Analysis Learning can be transformed
This is the reductions observation : that the ability to solve one kind of learning problems implies the ability to solve other kinds of leanring problems .
This statement is similarly generic .
Analysis Learning can be preserved
This is the online learning with experts observation : that we can have a master algorithm which preserves the best learning performance of subalgorithms .
This statement is again generic .
Analysis Overfitting Learning algorithms can easily overfit to existing training data .
How to analyze this ( with an IID assumption ) , and how to avoid it are very important for success .
Analysis Hardness of Learning
It turns out that there are several different ways in which machine learning can be hard including computational and information theoretic hardness .
Some of PAC learning is relevant here .
An understanding of how and why learning algorithms can fail seems important to understand the process .
Applications Vision
One example of how learning is applied to solve vision problems .
Applications Language Ditto for language problems .
Applications Robotics Ditto for robotics Applications Speech Ditto for speech Applications Businesses Ditto for businesses
Where is machine learning going ?
Insert predictions of the future here .
It should be understood that the field of machine learning is changing rapidly .
The emphasis here is on fundamentals : generally applicable mathematical statements and understandings of the learning problem .
Given that emphasis , the ‘ applications ’ section could be cut without harming the integrity of the purpose .
Silencing natural growth inhibitors may make it possible to regenerate nerves damaged by brain or spinal cord injury , finds a study from Children 's Hospital Boston .
In a mouse study published in the November 7 issue of Science , researchers temporarily silenced genes that prevent mature neurons from regenerating , and caused them to recover and re-grow vigorously after damage .
Because injured neurons cannot regenerate , there is currently no treatment for spinal cord or brain injury , says Zhigang He , PhD , Associate Professor of Neurology at Children 's and senior author on the paper .
Previous studies that looked at removing inhibitory molecules from the neurons ' environment , including some from He 's own lab , have found only modest effects on nerve recovery .
But now He 's team , in collaboration with Mustafa Sahin , MD , PhD , Assistant Professor of Neurology at Children 's , demonstrates that re-growth is primarily regulated from within the cells themselves .
" We knew that on completion of development , cells stop growing due to genetic mechanisms that prevent overgrowth , " explains He .
" We thought that this kind of mechanism might also prevent regeneration after injury . "
The key pathway for controlling cell growth in neurons , known as the mTOR pathway , is active in cells during development , but is substantially down - regulated once neurons have matured .
Moreover , upon injury , this pathway is almost completely silenced , presumably for the cell to conserve energy to survive .
He and colleagues reasoned that preventing this down - regulation might allow regeneration to occur .
He and his team used genetic techniques to delete two key inhibitory regulators of the mTOR pathway , known as PTEN and TSC1 , in the brain cells of mice .
After two weeks , the mice were subjected to mechanical damage of the optic nerve .
Two weeks post - injury , up to 50 percent of injured neurons in the mice with gene deletions of PTEN or TSC1 survived , compared to about 20 percent of those without the deletions .
And of the surviving mutant mice , up to 10 percent showed significant re-growth of axons , the fiber - like projections of neurons that transmit signals , over long distances .
This re-growth increased over time .
Although this study used genetic techniques ,
He notes that it may be possible to accomplish the same re-growth through pharmacologic means .
" This is the first time it has been possible to see such significant regeneration by manipulating single molecules , " says He .
" We believe that these findings have opened up the possibility for making small - molecule drugs or developing other approaches to promote axon regeneration . "
While such long - distance regeneration of axons has not been seen before using other techniques , it is still unknown whether these regenerating axons can restore function , He adds .
The research group is now looking at axon regeneration after spinal cord injury and given the current availability of specific PTEN inhibitors , the researchers hope that these and similar small - molecule inhibitors of the mTOR pathway will lead to future neural regeneration therapies .
Kevin Park , PhD , Kai Liu , PhD , Yang Hu , PhD , and Patrice Smith , PhD , all of Children 's , share significant authorship of the paper .
This study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , Wings for Life , the Adelson Foundation and the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance .
The hundred days are happening now .
That 's the real headline on President - elect Obama 's series of news conferences and his announcements of intended administration policy , such as an economic stimulus package .
We do n't really have to wait till after the inauguration on Jan. 20 for the new administration to begin .
What the Obama transition has become is historically unprecedented .
He is filling the vacuum created by a collapsed incumbency and an acute economic crisis .
He is moving forward with what looks like a high , if ad hoc , awareness of the delicacy of the situation .
He can't seem presumptuous or aggressive : " We only ...

There 's a commonly - held belief that just about every animal on Earth tastes of chicken * - except , of course , those which taste like steak , or bacon .
In the latter category , according to popular myth , are people - something only Uruguayan rugby players know for certain .
Until now , that is , because NEC earlier this year unveiled its Health and Food Advice Robot which was primarily designed to discern fine wines , but can also sniff out cheese and meats .
It 's all pretty straightforward tech : stick a bit of nosh in front of the robogourmet 's infrared spectrometer and it analyses the reflected light to determine the chemical composition of the sample .
A nice trick , although it can only be programmed to accurately identify a few dozen wines .
Innocent enough , you may think .
However , when NEC demonstrated the cybersommelier to a reporter and snapper from Associated Press , the robot claimed the former 's hand tasted of prosciutto ham , while the latter apparently had the unmistakable whiff of bacon about him .
Further comment is not necessary , except to warn neoLuddite Resistance Army activists to keep a sharp eye out for Japanese robots wielding frying pans , thick slices of crusty bread and bottles of brown sauce . ®

Even if you hate daylight saving time , you tell yourself :
Hey , I should n’t be so selfish , it ’s good for the economy , or for the environment , or for farmers , or something .
Right ?
Well , um , perhaps not .
Consider a new working paper , “ Does Daylight Saving Time Save Energy ?
Evidence From a Natural Experiment in Indiana , ” by Matthew J. Kotchen and Laura E. Grant :
The history of daylight saving time ( D.S.T. ) has been long and controversial .
Throughout its implementation during World Wars I and II , the oil embargo of the 1970 ’s , consistent practice today , and recent extensions , the primary rationale for D.S.T. has always been to promote energy conservation .
Nevertheless , there is surprisingly little evidence that D.S.T. actually saves energy .
This paper takes advantage of a natural experiment in the state of Indiana to provide the first empirical estimates of D.S.T. effects on electricity consumption in the United States since the mid-1970’s .
Focusing on residential electricity demand , we conduct the first - ever study that uses micro-data on households to estimate an overall D.S.T. effect .
The dataset consists of more than 7 million observations on monthly billing data for the vast majority of households in southern Indiana for three years .
Our main finding is that — contrary to the policy ’s intent — D.S.T. increases residential electricity demand .
Estimates of the overall increase are approximately 1 percent , but we find that the effect is not constant throughout the D.S.T. period .
D.S.T. causes the greatest increase in electricity consumption in the fall , when estimates range between 2 and 4 percent .
These findings are consistent with simulation results that point to a tradeoff between reducing demand for lighting and increasing demand for heating and cooling .
We estimate a cost of increased electricity bills to Indiana households of $ 9 million per year .
We also estimate social costs of increased pollution emissions that range from $ 1.7 to $ 5.5 million per year .
Finally , we argue that the effect is likely to be even stronger in other regions of the United States .

IQALUIT , Nunavut , Nov. 6 ( UPI ) --
The northeastern Canadian territory of Nunavut has ignored conservationists ' pleas and will permit a cull of 105 polar bears , officials said .
The Globe and Mail quoted territorial Ministry of Environment officials in Iqaluit as saying the quota first set in 2004 would be unchanged .

Earlier this year , the United States declared polar bears a threatened species and banned the import of the animal 's body parts by big - game hunters , a move the WWF - Canada conservation group applauded .
However , Peter Ewins , the group 's director of species conservation said he can't understand the decision to allow more hunting by indigenous Inuit people and recreational hunters .
" You can't pretend to be looking after polar bears by carrying on with the same level of harvest .
It is just totally unacceptable , " Ewins said .
" They 've made a huge mistake that caused a 30 percent population decline . "
Various estimates show the number of polar bears has dropped from an estimated 2,100 in 1997 to about 1,500 now , the newspaper said .

Never has there been an American President who revealed so much of himself prior to taking to office , or launched upon such a public quest for personal discovery .
By his mid-forties , President - elect Obama had authored two memoirs of his scattered life , both of which became global best - sellers .
His search for identity has been instrumental in his upward journey towards power .
The Obamas will make history when they move into The White House Yet for all his " age of Oprah " candour , and for all the 400 - plus pages of his beguiling autobiography , Dreams from My Father , to many he remains a frustratingly elusive and enigmatic figure .
Who precisely is Barack Hussein Obama , a politician who defies neat encapsulation ?
The back - story begins in a suitably exotic location : Hawaii .
Back in the late - 1950s , America 's most newly - minted state was the meeting place for his African father , Barack Hussein Obama Sr , and his American mother , Ann Dunham .
A talented and exuberant economist who had won a scholarship to the University of Hawaii , Barack Sr came from the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya .
His mother , Ann , was an " awkward , shy American girl " , from Wichita , Kansas .
Though Barack
Sr was five years her elder , they met in a Russian language class and quickly fell in love .
Black father , white mother
The couple were married on 21 February 1961 , a month after John F Kennedy took the presidential oath of office .
Less than six months later , they celebrated the birth of a child , Barack Hussein Obama Jr .
He was the product of what was then a rarity in post - war American society : a mixed - race marriage .
As Barack Obama himself wrote , his father was as " black as pitch " , while his mother was as " white as milk " .
Barack Obama 's long road to the White House
In pictures
Certainly , there are clues to Obama 's personality in the unorthodox backgrounds and personalities of his parents .
His father had come to the University of Hawaii as its first black student , and became the president of the International Student Association .
He was known for his rich speaking voice , strong opinions and a magnetic personal charisma .
His mother was an only child , who was christened Stanley Ann because her parents yearned for a boy .
As a schoolgirl and student , she was known for her quick wit , feisty intelligence and expansive vocabulary .
The marriage did not last long , but then Barack Sr hardly fitted the mould of the reliable husband .
Before arriving in Hawaii , he had been married already to a local Kenyan woman , who mothered four of his children ( he lied to his new wife , Ann , that he had arrived in Hawaii a divorcee ) .
Then , when Barack Jr was still a toddler , he decided to take up a scholarship at Harvard , turning down a more financially generous offer from New York University which would have supported the whole family .
So Ann and young Barry , as he was then known , remained in Hawaii .
And thereafter , Barack Obama
Sr made only one more appearance in his son's life , visiting him in Hawaii when he was aged 10 .
There was nobody like me in the Sears , Roebuck Christmas catalogue
Barack Obama , Dreams from My Father
The break - up of his parents ' marriage set - up the next episode in Barack Obama 's life : his years in Indonesia .
Ann met another foreign student at the University of Hawaii , an Indonesian by the name of Lolo Soetoro .
They lived as a family for two years in Hawaii , before leaving for Jakarta in 1967 .
Within six months , Barry had learnt Indonesia 's language and was being awoken by his mother at 4 am each morning so that she could give him additional English lessons before school .
Perhaps his thirst for self - improvement , and his fierce self - criticism , stem from those pre-dawn lessons .
There were other formative influences .
His step - father was a Muslim , though he followed a brand of Islam , according to Barack , " that could make room for the remnants of more ancient animist and Hindu faiths " .
Social conscience Certainly , Barack appears to have been impressed by the broad experience and worldliness of his stepfather .
" Not just how to change a flat tyre or open in chess , " he later wrote .
" He knew more elusive things , ways of managing emotions I felt , ways to explain fate 's constant mysteries . "
Barack Obama 's way with words is a " vital political tool " Perhaps Obama 's steady - state temperament and capacity for emotional detachment come from his stepfather .
Once , after Barry had been bullied by an older boy , Lolo also taught his adopted son to punch above his weight , another useful lesson for his future career in politics .
Indonesia also exposed Barack to the kind of Third World suffering that may well have aroused his social conscience .
In Dreams from My Father , he spoke of the sorrowful faces of drought - hit farmers , and of the beggar who came to his door with a gaping hole where his nose should have been .
More importantly , perhaps , Obama became more overtly aware of his skin colour .
On the television shows imported from America , he noticed that the black character in the hit series Mission Impossible spent all his time underground and that " there was nobody like me in the Sears , Roebuck Christmas catalogue " .
His racial consciousness had stirred .
Aged 10 , Barack was sent back to Hawaii to complete his education - in Indonesia , he had spent two years at a Catholic school and two years at a Muslim school - while his mother remained in Jakarta .
During this unsettled period of his life , he was raised by his maternal grandparents , Stanley and Madelyn , his beloved Toot who died on the eve of his election .
It was not the happiest of homecomings .
On his first day at his new school , there were titters in the classroom when the teacher read out his exotic - sounding name ; and he was frosty towards a girl called Coretta , the only other black pupil in his grade .
Search for identity " From the first day , we avoided each other but watched from a distance , " he wrote later , " as if direct contact would only remind us more keenly of our isolation . "
Later , he experienced the rare thrill of racial and familial pride , when his father , Barack Sr , visited Hawaii and delivered a speech before his class .
" Your dad is pretty cool , " said one of his classmates , who earlier had asked a question about cannibalism .
After that proud day in class , Barack Obama was abandoned once more by his father , and thereafter his high - school years were wracked by confusion and self - doubt .
Chicago proved the making of him .
Ultimately , it was where he found Jesus , his wife , Michelle , and his sense of political mission
" I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America , " he wrote , " and beyond the given experience of my experience , no one around me seemed to know exactly what that meant . "
This was the period in his life when he started living out what he called a caricature of black male adolescence .
He loved playing basketball , drank and experimented with narcotics - pot , cocaine ( when he could afford it ) , but not heroin .
Drugs seemingly helped push the question of his identity out of his mind .
At the same time , he seemed aggrieved that Hawaii placed him so far away from the more common black experience : of growing up in the post - segregation South or the slums of Harlem , Watts , Detroit or the South Side of Chicago .
Though his mother had taken a keen interest in the emerging civil rights movement , he had no direct connection with the struggle for black equality .
Tellingly , then , he was attracted to the writings of Malcolm X , with their emphasis on black nationalism , self - discipline and self - reliance , rather than the less confronting essays of the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr , with integration and racial harmony .
After graduating from high school , he enrolled at Occidental College in Los Angeles , where there were enough black students to form a " tribe " .
Two years later , he transferred to Columbia University in New York .
Columbia is Ivy League , but it was the ethnic flavour of New York that drew him east .
Chicago " I 'd at least be at the heart of a true city , " he recalled , " with black neighbourhoods in close proximity . "
It was in the black neighbourhoods that Barack Obama found his metier , working as a community organiser .
On graduation from Columbia , he worked for a year in the corporate sector before joining a public interest group in New York , which campaigned for upgrades to the city 's subway system .
Then he left for Chicago , drawn partly by the recent election of a black mayor , Harold Washington .
There , he joined the faith - based community action group , the Developing Communities Project .
Chicago proved the making of him .
Ultimately , it was where he found Jesus , his wife , Michelle , and his sense of political mission .
Barack Obama has referred to his wife , Michelle , as " the love of my life "
In the city 's demoralised South Side , he worked on job training programmes and local housing projects .
His grass roots campaigns soon brought him into contact with the Reverend Jeremiah Wright , an exuberant local preacher .
The first time that Barack Obama listened to one of the preacher 's sermons , he broke down and wept .
It was entitled The Audacity of Hope , which became the title of Barack Obama 's breakthrough speech at the Democratic Convention in 2004 , and the book which launched his presidential campaign .
During his initial three years in Chicago , Obama mused with friends about whether he should become a preacher , a journalist or a novelist .
But ultimately he decided to pursue a career in law , and gained a place at the prestigious Harvard Law School .
African and American
His years at Harvard first brought him to the attention of the national press , when he became the first black President of the legal journal , the Harvard Law Review .
It was heralded as a major racial first .
His time at Harvard Law School also brought him to the attention of his future wife , Michelle , an attorney with an elite Chicago legal firm where Barack worked as a summer associate .
The descendant of slaves , whose undergraduate dissertation at Princeton focussed on the subject of black advance , Michelle was much more firmly rooted in the black tradition .
Barack Obama is sometimes called an African and an American , but not an African - American .
By contrast , there is no doubting his wife 's bloodline , since it reaches back to the pre-Civil War American South .
The couple were married in 1992 .
Perhaps her background provided some of the flint for their relationship .
Success at Harvard led to Barack Obama 's first book deal , and Dreams from My Father .
It also brought lucrative offers to work at high - end corporate law firms .
But Barack Obama decided to return to Chicago , where he taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School and resumed his community activism .
Throughout this period , he became more politically focused and active .
In 1992 , he ran a voter registration campaign which helped the black candidate , Carol Moseley Braun , win election as a US Senator for Illinois ( thus becoming the first African - American woman to claim a seat in the Senate ) .
Michelle 's connections - her best friend is the daughter of the civil rights leader , Jesse Jackson , and she had worked for Chicago 's powerful mayor , Richard M Daley - also brought him into closer contact with the city 's Democratic political elite .
Now , Barack Obama displayed a more calculating side of his character : a sometimes highly strategic choice about his political friends and mentors , which also served him well in the US Senate .
Crowds gathered throughout the world to honour Mr Obama 's big win With the contacts necessary to succeed in the hot - house climate of Chicago politics , Obama ran in 1996 for a seat in the Illinois state Senate , which included parts of the South Side and the more fashionable Hyde Park neighbourhood .
Showing the harsher , and more ruthless , side of his political personality , he defeated the popular Democratic incumbent and former ally , Alice Palmer .
The veteran Illinois politician had first decided to step down but then decided to re-enter the race .
Obama campaigned successfully to get her name removed from the ballot .
Lure of Washington Back then , of course , Jeremiah Wright was the most useful of political allies .
So , too , was Tony Rezko , a Chicago - based political fund - raiser convicted this year of fraud and bribery .
So perhaps it is no coincidence that his years as a Chicago politician get the least attention in his memoirs , for they reveal less attractive sides of his political personality : hard - nosed calculation combined with eager ambition .
Sure enough , Washington DC soon became the target of his ambitions .
In 2000 , after just four years in the Illinois State Senate , he tried to win the Democratic primary in one of Chicago 's US congressional seats .
But he was defeated by the former Black Panther , Bobby Rush , another popular incumbent .
There is not a black and white America and Latino America and Asian America - there 's the United States of America
Barack Obama , Democratic Convention 2004
Four years on , Barack Obama won his party 's nomination to fight for the US Senate , a campaign which brought him into contact with the then Senator John Kerry .
So impressed was Kerry with the telegenic , 40 - something Chicago candidate that he invited him to deliver a keynote speech at the Democratic Convention .
Before a prime - time audience , Obama deployed his most vital political tool : his mesmerising power of speech .
And fittingly for a politician who had shown such a preoccupation with his own personal identity , the main subject of his address was America 's search for itself .
" There is not a liberal America and a conservative America , " he proclaimed .
" There is a United States of America .
There is not a black and white America and Latino America and Asian America - there 's the United States of America .
The pundits like to slice - and - dice our country into red states and blue states ... but I 've got news for them , too .
We worship an ' awesome God ' in the blue states , and we do n't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states . "
Launching his quest for post - partisanship , he jettisoned the angry language of polarization , and rejected the rhetorical and political constructs of the Sixties .
Crucially , he also saw the political value in deploying his wide - ranging biography , and spoke of how his white grandfather had served in George Patton 's army and how his black grandfather cooked for his British colonial masters .
His quixotic personal history became his message .
" I stand here today , grateful for the diversity of my heritage , " he said , " knowing that my story is part of the larger American story . "
That speech in 2004 arguably provided the most important turning point of the 2008 campaign .
And the rest is epoch - changing history .
Barack Obama has won the presidency by persuading more than 50 % of the US electorate that his story resonates with their own .
With poetry and poise , he has given voice to a personal history that is as messy , complicated , confounding and inspiring as the country he now leads .
Who is Barack Obama ?
For many of his admiring supporters , he is the very idea of modern - day America .

Adelaide police are investigating a frightening case of road rage in the city 's northern suburbs .
A passing motorist captured the incident on video as a driver appeared to become agitated with a truck blocking his path on the Salisbury Highway .
The man , driving a white sedan , followed the truck for at least 3 km and then swerved in front of the truck and stopped in its path .
He then got out of his car and verbally abused the truckie as well as striking the cabin 's door .
The truck managed to squeeze past the car and drive off , but the man climbed back into his car and gave chase .
He again managed to stop the truck by the roadside , and reversed his car onto a 90 degree angle block its path .
The driver , wearing a bright - yellow shirt , again gets out of his car and continues to scream at the truckie before climbing up to the vehicle 's window and throwing punches .
" Get out !
Get out ! " he repeatedly yells .
Unable to make the truck driver exit the cabin , he takes his anger out on the truck itself , kicking the front of the vehicle .
The man filming the incident then comes to the assailant 's attention , as the crazed man approaches his car .
" The guy 's nuts , " the cameraman can be heard saying on his mobile phone .
" The guy 's coming to me now , I 've got my daughter in the car … I 'm just going to run him over .
"
He then speeds off as the man comes within metres of his car .
Police are attempting to locate the people involved .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
Mark to market is a business rarity - an accounting term that draws reactions from people who do n't know spreadsheets from bedsheets .
Mark to market , which we 'll call MTM , evokes images of Enron 's made - up profits and the other corporate scandals that marred the first years of this decade .
Not pretty .
Now MTM - which means valuing marketable securities at market prices - is a hot item again , but for the opposite reason .
This time financial companies and their allies are claiming it 's too strict .
They argue that marking the value of complex , illiquid securities to artificially low market prices has unnecessarily crippled the U.S. and world financial systems by creating billions of illusory losses on perfectly fine ( albeit illiquid ) securities , such as collateralized debt obligations linked to mortgages .
Markets for these things , the argument goes , are depressed way below true economic value .
Accountants argue that MTM - known formally as Financial Accounting Standard 157 - is fine , although the Financial Accounting Standards Board has agreed to tweak it some .
( Do n't ask me for details - the written arguments on this are so sleep - inducing they could be marketed as an Ambien alternative . )
This week , the Securities and Exchange Commission is scheduled to hold a high - profile public meeting about MTM .
The SEC , which has the power to overrule FASB , is holding the meeting because Section 133 of the $ 700 billion bailout bill requires that it study MTM and report to Congress by late December .
The guy who got 133 into the bill , Representative Spencer Bachus ( R - Alabama ) , the ranking minority member of the House Banking Committee , told me he was n't trying to politicize accounting .
" It just says , ' Study it , ' " he told me .
" It does n't say [ to do ] a study to repeal it .
It does n't say [ to do ] a study to suspend it . "
But given that it 's finger - pointing time both in Washington and on Wall Street , it 's not going to be easy for the SEC to leave mark to market strictly alone .
In this environment what regulator dares run the risk of being held responsible for not doing something that would supposedly mitigate the world 's credit crunch ?
Would you want to find yourself accused of failing to act if the financial world totally melted down , as it has occasionally seemed about to do ?
Normal accounting is being overridden to help banks in various ways .
In early October , for instance , federal financial regulators jointly ruled that the $ 125 billion of preferred stock the Treasury is buying from nine big banks will be treated as tier - one capital ( the best kind ) , even though it normally would n't qualify .
Second , in a little - noted move , regulators allowed banks with losses on some Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) securities to treat the resulting tax savings as tier one in their regulatory statements for the third quarter .
That 's strange , given that the third quarter ended Sept. 30 , as usual , but legislation making this tax break usable did n't become law until Oct.
3 . How often has my source for this nugget - accounting guru Robert Willens of Robert Willens LLC - seen such grandfathering in his 40 - year career ?
" Never , " he says .
Of course , this is more about optics than economics .
As is mark to market , in my humble opinion .
Credit markets have been frozen much of the past 15 months largely because banks have n't trusted the balance sheets of other banks and have thus been afraid to lend to them .
I can't imagine that confidence problem being resolved by changing MTM .
There are problems with MTM :
It 's relatively new , and parts of it seem arbitrary .
But its problems have been exaggerated .
It 's easier to blame accountants for your problems than to admit you made your institution vulnerable by overleveraging its balance sheet and buying securities you did n't understand .
Ironically , many of today 's whiners adopted MTM a year before they had to , partly because of an arcane provision that let them count as profit the decline in the market value of their publicly traded debt .
The bottom line : Despite MTM 's flaws , blaming it for the world 's financial problems is n't the answer .
Neither is shooting the messenger - or , in this case , the accountant .
IBM , Harvard Use Distributed Computing to Make Ultra-Powerful Solar Cells
December 8th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Researchers at IBM and Harvard are using the power of community to create cheap , efficient solar cells .
The Clean Energy Project will use small amounts of computing power from volunteers — like in the SETI project — to run calculations on compounds in the hopes of finding a combination of organic materials that can be used to make cheap , flexible plastic solar cells .
Technology resulting from the experiment could be used to make solar windows , line blankets , and backpacks .
The solar power project will use IBM ’s World Community Grid — a large network of volunteer computers with calculating capabilities that rank it as one of the top ten supercomputers in the world .
IBM ’s number - crunching Grid software runs in the background of volunteer computers as a screensaver .
The program will process over 1 million configurations of atoms in the next two years .
According to IBM and Harvard scientists , the cloud - computing experiment will cut the time necessary to run the solar power calculations by 20 years .
With potentially game - changing results , perhaps it will inspire other scientific endeavors to harness people - power .

Man Causes Confusion by Dumping Girlfriend ’s Body
Earlier this year in September , a strange crime was committed in Izu , Japan , that shocked the authorities and media around the world .
A 60 year - old man , having lost his wife a few years ago , had been having a relationship with his girlfriend for some time .
Having decided that he would move into one of his kid ’s homes , he decided she would have to go .
“ He was confused about how to get rid of her .
He thought it would be cruel to cut her up into pieces and throw her out with the trash , so he proceeded to dump her ” said the lead investigator .
The confused man decided to tie and wrap his girlfriend in a sleeping bag and dumped her corpse in a remote wooded area .
A few weeks later , a couple who was walking their dog , discovered the corpse and call the police .
A criminal investigation was immediately launched , but it was not until a few hours later when the forensic team finally started to unwrap and investigate the corpse , that the biggest shock was revealed .
The corpse was actually a life - size silicone sex doll .
Furious and convinced that someone was playing a joke on them , the authorities vowed to find the person responsible and charge them with interfering with a police investigation .
After seeing the news story about his girlfriend , the old man immediately called the police to explain to them what happened .
Even though the old man apologized for the trouble he caused , he still may face fines for violating Japan ’s Waste Management Laws .

TOYOTA CITY , Japan 
Facing labor shortages back in 1990 but ever wary of allowing in foreigners , Japan made an exception for Japanese - Brazilians .
With their Japanese roots , names and faces , these children and grandchildren of Japanese emigrants to Brazil would fit more easily in a society fiercely closed to outsiders , or so the reasoning went .
In the two decades since then , despite periodic economic downturns like the current one , the number of Japanese - Brazilian workers in Japan has kept growing .
They are clustered in industrial regions dotted with factories supplying familiar companies like Honda , Sanyo and Toyota , whose headquarters gave this city in central Japan its name .
But perhaps nowhere in this country do Japanese and Japanese - Brazilians rub shoulders with such intensity as in a public housing complex here called Homi Estate .
Built in the 1970s for young Japanese families , Homi has a population of 8,891 that is now nearly evenly split between Japanese , at 52 percent , and foreigners , at 48 percent .
“ To be honest , ” Toshinori Fujiwara , 69 , a Japanese community leader , said , “ I never imagined in my wildest dreams that this would ever become a multiethnic neighborhood . ”
The International Monetary Fund approved $ 16.4bn in emergency funding for Ukraine to stabilise the nation 's economy , which is being pummelled by falling export values , rising inflation and the effects of the global financial meltdown .
The two - year agreement allows the Eastern European country to receive $ 4.5 bn immediately in exchange for agreeing to a series of financial reforms .

Among them are agreements governing flexible exchange rates , higher funding for unemployment insurance and banking recapitalisation .
" The Ukrainian economy , especially the banking system , is experiencing considerable stress , " IMF deputy managing director and acting chairman Murilo Portugal said in a statement .
" Falling prices for Ukraine 's major export , steel , have led to a substantial deterioration in Ukraine 's current account outlook . "
The IMF has already agreed to lend Iceland $ 2.1bn and is in talks with Hungary for an estimated $ 10 bn to $ 12.5 bn in loans .
Poll : Less than half say US offers liberty and justice for all Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 28 , 2008

This A new poll from Rasmussen Reports indicates that although Americans strongly support the saying of the Pledge of Allegience , less than half of them believe that " the United States is truly the land of liberty and justice for all . "
Among those polled , just 46 % said they would agree with that statement , while 42 % disagreed .
Even among white voters , less than half , just 49 % , agreed that there is justice for all in America .
The highest level of agreement was 62 % among Republicans , followed by a majority among men .
However , women disagreed by a narrow plurality of 45 % and Democrats by a more substantial 53 % .
Black voters were the group that disagreed most strongly , with 60 % denying that there is liberty and justice for all and only 20 % agreeing .
However , Ramussen noted that a slightly different poll taken three weeks ago , which asked people whether they " viewed American society as fair and decent , " showed that agreement with that statement by black voters had leaped to 42 % immediately following the election of Barack Obama , compared with 24 % just a month earlier .
This higher figure as compared with the " justice " poll may be in line with the fact that 65 % of the general population believes that American society is fair and decent .
Perhaps " justice " is seen by many Americans , both black and white , as a quality both different from and more difficult to obtain than simple decency .
I want to talk about being an atheist in the queer community .
This is going to be hard to talk about .
But it 's been on my mind a lot lately , and I think it 's important to say .
I see a lot of parallels between the atheist community and the queer community .
I think that the two movements have a great deal in common -- the importance of coming out of the closet , an ongoing family argument between the more diplomatic and the more confrontational activist philosophies , being a scapegoat of the religious right , etc . .
In a lot of ways , I think the atheist movement today is very much where the queer movement was in the early ' 70s -- newly visible , newly vocal , pissed off as hell , still finding its voice , just beginning to gain real strength .
I think the two communities could learn an enormous amount from each other , and I think that they 're natural allies .
And yet , I 'm having a realization that I 'm finding extremely unsettling .
I 've been an out queer , and an active participant in the queer community , for over 20 years now .
I 've felt for years like the LGBT community was my home base .
I 've only identified as an atheist for less than two years .
And yet I 'm finding that I feel more at home -- more welcomed , more valued , more truly understood -- as a queer in the atheist community than I do as an atheist in the queer community .
Like , a lot more .
In the last year or two , after a stretch of being more focused on other issues and movements ( sex radicalism , mostly , plus of course the atheism ) , I 've been getting more involved again with the LGBT movement .
I 've been reading LGBT blogs ; I 've been participating in an email list of LGBT political people ; I 've been donating money to LGBT causes ; I went to the recent LGBT bloggers ' conference .
And here are some of the things I 've experienced .
I 've been exhorted to pray .
I 've been told about " our Creator . "
I 've seen comments in LGBT blogs , listing bigoted and wildly inaccurate anti-atheist canards that could have come straight out of the religious right 's playbook .
I 've heard inaccurate statistics bandied about regarding how many believers and non-believers there are in the U.S.... statistics that diminish atheists ' numbers and our strength .
( For the record : We 're more than five percent , people . )
I 've heard the inaccurate and insulting canard about " fundamentalist " atheists ... and , when I 've pointed out that this term is both inaccurate and insulting , had the language firmly defended .
I 've heard the LGBT movement described as divided into two distinct groups : the reasonable ones who want to work with religious groups , and the unreasonable ones who think that religion is a delusion .
( As if it were impossible to think that religion is a mistaken hypothesis about the world , and at the same time still think we need to work with religious groups . )
I 've heard the atheist movement described as divided into two distinct groups : the good ones , the " live and let live " ones who do n't criticize religion , and the bad ones , the intolerant " fundamentalist " ones who think they 're right and say so .
( Where have we heard that kind of language before ? )
I 've heard LGBT leaders talk about how important it is to reach out to people of different religious faiths ... with no mention whatsoever made of reaching out to people with no religious faith .
Not even in lip service .
And I 've been in the unsettling position of being the person that LGBT people come to to tell about their godlessness .
Have you ever been the out LGBT person that other LGBT people came to , privately or semi-privately , to tell you that they 're L , G , B , or T ?
That 's how I 'm beginning to feel as an atheist in the queer community .
I 'm not going to pretend to speak for these folks .
I do n't know exactly how they feel about their lack of religious belief , or why they 're choosing to stay quiet about it for the moment .
It could be any number of reasons : from not wanting to be alienated from the community , to not having the time or energy or inclination to do Godlessness 101 education , to not wanting to raise potentially divisive issues at a time when we 've already had a lot of infighting , to just not thinking that it's that big a deal , to other reasons that probably have n't occurred to me .
I do n't pretend to speak for them , and I 'm certainly not going to be anything but supportive of them .
Like LGBT people , non-believers need to come out of the closet on their own timetable , and for their own reasons .
But I think we all know that , when you make yourself visible as an LGBT person in a non- specifically - LGBT group , and a whole bunch of people come up to you privately to tell you that they 're LGBT ... you know that there 's a problem .
You know that something 's going on in that group that 's making LGBT people feel like they can't be completely out .
It seems like that 's happening for atheists and other non-believers in the LGBT community .
And the whole thing is making me really sad .
It 's ticking me off , too .
But mostly , it 's making me sad .
It 's reminding me of my earlier days in the community , when we were fighting for the B to be included in LGBT , and people who I thought were my family were telling me that I did n't belong .
It 's making me feel like I have to fight for my place at the table .
It 's making me feel like I have to choose between being welcomed , and speaking my mind about things that are deeply important to me .
It 's making me feel like my home is not my home anymore .
Being a queer in the atheist community , on the other hand ...
Being a queer in the atheist community is almost a complete non-issue .
I write a lot about the parallels between the LGBT movement and the atheist movement ... and atheists , of all sexual orientations , are always interested .
When I talk about sexual orientation and queer politics and history -- or just about my own personal experiences in my own queer relationship -- atheists want to hear what I have to say about it .
And when I do n't -- when I just want to talk about creationism or Pascal 's Wager or the problem of evil or the meaning of life -- then they want to hear what I have to say about that , too .
Not as an LGBT representative , either ; not as What The LGBT Community Has to Say About Pascal 's Wager .
Just as Greta .
And the atheist community has been fierce and outspoken in defense of LGBT rights .
To give just one example :
The atheist blogosphere needed no prodding to blog about Prop 8 .
They were all over the issue like a cheap suit .
Almost every atheist blog I read had something to say about it ; many of them blogged about it multiple times .
And they were all over the issue from very early on .
Hell , I know straight atheist bloggers who were blogging about Prop 8 before I was .
This is n't just true for Prop 8 or same - sex marriage , either .
The atheist blogosphere talks about homophobia a fair amount .
They see it , among other things , as one of the main examples of how traditional organized religion is stubbornly adhering to unsupported dogma at the expense of real human lives .
And that makes it a big issue for them .
Apart from just , you know , being appalled by it because it hurts their friends and loved ones .
Apart from it just being the right thing to do .
I 'm not saying that I 've never encountered homophobia or homo - stupidity in the atheist community .
I have .
But I 've found it to be very rare , very much the exception .
And maybe more to the point :
When it does show up , it gets smacked down like a bug , by a dozen different hands or more .
I do n't always have to be the one to do the smacking .
I do n't even usually have to be the one to do the smacking .
When a homophobic or homo - stupid commenter shows up , the atheist blogosphere -- straight and queer -- promptly tears them about sixteen new assholes .
I have never before been in a community where I felt so strongly that straight people had my back .
On the whole , the atheist community has been just about the most LGBT - positive community I 've been in that was n't , specifically , an LGBT community itself .
I 've had to do almost no Queer 101 education in it .
I 've been able to just relax and be myself .
Now .
I do understand that this comparison is n't entirely fair .
For one thing , the modern queer movement has been active and loud , visible and vocal , for a good 40 years now .
The rest of the world has had time to , as the chant goes , get used to it .
The atheist community ?
Not so much .
The atheist movement has been around for a while ; but it 's only been active and loud , visible and vocal , making itself an un-ignorable presence in the world at large , for maybe the last five years or so .
Straight people -- including atheists -- have had a long time to get educated about LGBT issues .
Religious believers -- including LGBT folks -- have n't had as long to get familiar with atheism .
So it 's not terribly surprising that there should be troubling attitudes about atheists and atheism in the LGBT community .
Disappointing , but not surprising .
And it 's not like this situation is universally terrible .
It 's not .
There are queer believers who are saying and doing lovely and supportive things for their non-believing compatriots .
There are other queer non-believers who are talking openly about their godlessness -- I 'm hardly the only one .
And it 's not like anyone 's throwing rocks at me or anything .
It 's not terrible .
It 's just bad enough to make me feel like I 'm not quite at home anymore .
I am both an atheist and a queer .
I feel like I 'm one of the bridges between the two communities , and that makes me happy : I think the two movements are natural allies , and I think there should be bridges between them .
( If only for reasons of pure pragmatism , I damn well think the LGBT community should be working like crazy on that alliance .
IMO , the atheist movement is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years and decades : it 's come very far in a very short time , and it 's growing by leaps and bounds every year . )
But lately , I 'm feeling like this bridge is a lot more strongly supported on one side than it is on the other .
I 'm feeling like the people on one side of the bridge are heartily cheering me on and welcoming me with open arms , and the people on the other side of the bridge are a whole lot more conflicted about me , with a fair number of them heartily wishing that I 'd just shut up .
And I 'm finding -- sadly , but not entirely surprisingly -- that I 'm feeling more strongly identified with my new friends who are cheering me on .
I 'm feeling more like an atheist than I am like a queer .
And if this trend in the LGBT community keeps moving in this same direction , then that 's just going to get stronger .
So how do I want this to change ?
That 's tomorrow 's post .
Sellers on eBay can no longer leave negative feedback for buyers , so what are they doing when they 're upset about a buyer 's remarks ?
Filing lawsuits — at least in the case of Joel Jones .
UK resident Jones has filed a lawsuit against Chris Read after Read , the winner of Jones ' eBay auction , left negative feedback on the transaction .
Jones claims that Read 's feedback is hurting his business and insists on pushing his libel suit unless Read deletes his comments .
The story unfolds exactly as many of us jaded eBay users would expect .
Read won an auction being held by Jones for a cell phone , but when he received the item , it was n't exactly what he expected .
" I was told the phone was in good condition , but there were scratches all over it , a big chip out of the side and it was a different phone .
I paid for a Samsung F700 and got a Samsung F700V , " Read told The Telegraph .
He promptly returned the phone to Jones and asked for a refund , following up with some negative feedback stating that the phone he received was scratched , chipped , and did not match the model number from the auction .
Seems pretty standard , up to this point .
Jones ended up giving Read a refund , but not before declaring that the negative feedback was damaging his business of selling electronics online .
Jones began threatening legal action against Read unless he deleted the comments .
Read responded that he was appalled by this behavior and said that he would go to court if necessary .
Well , be careful what you wish for .
Read found himself the recipient of a pre-court letter from Jones saying that he would be taken to court for £ 175 and attorney 's fees .
As to why he filed the suit , Jones told the Telegraph that the feedback was " unfair " and " unreasonable , " and that the refund should have warranted positive feedback instead .
" I 'm losing money by the day and my business could go under because of it .
I 've been left with no option but to take legal action and I 'm sure I 'll be successful , " Jones said .
It appears as if Jones may have filed this lawsuit regardless of eBay 's new feedback system , but many believe that involving the courts in eBay transactions gone wrong could become more common as a result of eBay 's elimination of negative feedback for sellers .
eBay announced the changes to the system back in February , when it said it was trying to clamp down on tit - for - tat feedback , in which buyers are reluctant to be entirely honest about transactions because they do n't want to receive negative feedback in return .
eBay noted at the time that sellers were eight times more likely to retaliate in kind against negative feedback , a figure that had grown dramatically over the years .
Needless to say , sellers were a bit miffed at eBay 's feedback changes , and organized a week - long strike that resulted in 13 percent fewer listings on eBay .
But , for many people who make a living selling stuff online , eBay is essential to business , and many have begrudgingly returned .
Although they can no longer leave negative feedback for buyers , things appear to be operating smoothly — more or less — on the auction site .
Libel lawsuits take tit - for - tat feedback a bit too far , however .
The sky is n't falling just yet , but if more sellers decided to go after their buyers in the same way Jones has , buyers will be seen running for the hills en masse .
And then who will buy all of your handmade duckling sculptures ?
Hardening The Linux Kernel With Grsecurity ( Debian )
Security is based on three characteristics : prevention , protection and detection .
Grsecurity is a patch for Linux kernel that allows you to increase each of these points .
This howto was performed on a Debian Lenny system .
Thus some tools are Debian specific .
However , tasks can be performed with other distro specific tools or even with universal tools ( make ) .
Everything will done with root privileges .
However , you can perform them with a limited account thanks to sudo and fake - kpkg tools .
1. Preliminary Note
To compile the kernel , you need to install some specific packages :
rom1 : / root# aptitude install patch bin86 kernel - package build - essential
If you like to configure your kernel in graphical console mode ( make menuconfig ) , you must install one more package :
rom1 :/ root# aptitude install libncurses5- dev
Check that iniramfs - tools ( used to generated the init ramdisk ) is installed ( it should be ) :
rom1 : / usr / src# dpkg -l initramfs *
Desired =Unknown / Install / Remove / Purge /Hold
| Status=Not / Installed / Config- files / Unpacked / Failed - config / Half - installed
|/ Err?=( none ) / Hold / Reinst- required /X=both- problems ( Status , Err : uppercase=bad )
||/ Name Version Description
+++-==============-==============-============================================
ii initramfs - tool 0.85 i tools for generating an initramfs
rom1:/usr/src#
Go to the source folder :
rom1:/ root # cd /usr / src
Download the grsecurity patch and the
2.6.24.5
Linux vanilla kernel :
rom1:/usr/src# wget grsecurity.net/grsecurity-2.1.11-2.6.24.5-200804211829.patch.gz
rom1:/usr/src# wget eu.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.24.5.tar.gz
NB : you may need to configure wget in case you are using an HTTP proxy ( which may use authentication ) .
You need to edit / root / . wgetrc so it looks like this :
http_proxy=192.168.0.1 proxy-user=foo #
Put this line if you need to authenticate against your proxy proxy - passwd=bar #
Put this line if you need to authenticate against your proxy
Decompress the archive of the kernel :
rom1:/usr / src# tar xzvf linux - 2.6.24.5.tar.gz
Create a symbolic link on the new kernel folder to ease the following tasks :
rom1:/usr/src# ln -s linux - 2.6.24.5 linux
Now , the environment is ready .
Let 's go hardening !
2 . Patch the vanilla kernel
Move the grsecurity patch to the new directory :
rom1:/usr/src# mv grsecurity - 2.1.11-2.6.24.5-200804211829.patch.gz linux/grsecurity -2.1.11-2.6.24.5-200804211829.patch.gz
Decompress and patch the source of the kernel :
rom1 :/usr / src# cd linux
rom1:/usr/src/linux# gunzip < grsecurity - 2.1.11-2.6.24.5-200804211829.patch.gz | patch - p1
Now the patch is applied and the source of the kernel was modified .
Let 's configure the kernel to enable Grsecurity .
AdvertisementAdvertisement
3 . Configure the hardened kernel
In this example , we will configure the kernel using a console menu ( make menuconfig ) .
This is why we installed the libncurses5 - dev package .
However , you can configure in pure console mode ( make config ) , or in GUI mode ( make xconfig ) .
Grsecurity has predefined levels : low , medium , high .
It can also be configured in custom level where you choose to enable or not option by option .
See http://www.grsecurity.net/confighelp.php/ for more info on each option .
In this HowTo , we will configure Grsecurity in High level .
rom1 :/usr /src/linux# make menuconfig
Now , we will enable Grsecurity in the menu .
Go to Security options > Grsecurity > tick Grsecurity .
Then , you can go to Security Level and tick High .

You can profit from configuring Grsecurity to optimise your kernel .
Eg :
On your server you probably do n't need support for infrared , blutooth , probably neither wifi , ipx , X25 , token ring , ATM , firewire , PCcard , joystick , mouse , sound ....
4. Compile the hardened kernel
It is now time to compile your hardened kernel .
First , just in case , clean up :
rom1 :/usr / src/linux# make - kpkg clean
Launch compilation itself ( this may take a while depending on your CPU power and RAM availability !!! ) :
rom1:/usr/src/linux# make - kpkg -- initrd -- append - to-version " grsec1.0 " kernel_image
In case you are not using a Debian distro , you can compile the classic way with :
make mrproper
make menuconfig
make clean
make
make modules_install
mkinitramfs
make install
Advertisement
5 . Install the hardened kernel
Your new kernel is now compiled and a .deb package file has been generated in the /usr / src folder .
You need to install your kernel as any .deb package :
rom1:/usr/src# dpkg - i linux - image -2.6.24.5-grsec_grsec1.0_i386.deb
During the installation , an initrd image will be generated .
This may take a while depending on your CPU power and RAM availability !
You may also check that the new kernel image is really a kernel !
rom1:/usr/src# file vmlinuz -2.6.24.5-grsec
vmlinuz - 2.6.24.5-grsec : Linux kernel x86 boot executable RO - rootFS , root_dev 0x801 , swap_dev 0x1 , Normal VGA
It is now time to restart your system with your new hardened kernel :
rom1:/usr /src/linux# shutdown -r now
Now that your system has restarted , you can check that your new kernel is running :
rom1 :~# uname -r
2.6.24.5-grsec
6 . Testing the hardened kernel
Except the fact that uname -r is saying your kernel is a grsec one , how do you know you are running a hardened kernel ?
This is where we will use paxtest which will simulate an attack on the kernel and show if you are vulnerable or not .
Download paxtest :
rom1 :/tmp# wget http://www.grsecurity.net/~paxguy1/paxtest-0.9.7-pre5.tar.gz
Extract it :
rom1 :/tmp# tar xzvf paxtest -0.9.7-pre5.tar.gz
rom1:/tmp# cd paxtest -0.9.7-pre5
Compile it ( type make to have the list of targets ) :
rom1:/tmp/paxtest-0.9.7-pre5 # make generic
Run it ( there are 2 differents modes : kiddie and blackhat ) :
rom1:/tmp/paxtest-0.9.7-pre5# ./ paxtest kiddie
NB : unless you are using high grsecurity level or custom level , you will have a vulnerable kernel .
Indeed , you are only getting userland ASLR protection in a medium mode .
According to the US Constitution , the only actual requirements for a person to be president are : 1 ) Must be over 35 years old ; 2 ) Must have lived in the United States at least 14 years ; and 3 ) Must be a natural born citizen .
Note that there 's no mention of gender or ethnic origin .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The term " natural born citizen " was clearly a little elastic in the early days .
All of the first seven American presidents were born British .
The first true natural - born American president ( despite his Dutch name ) was Martin Van Buren in 1837 .
He was born in 1782 , after the signing of the Declaration of Independence on 4 July 1776 .
Election day in the States is always the Tuesday following the first Monday in November .
It 's a public holiday in some states , but not others .
John Conyers of Michigan recently introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that would make election day a national holiday called Democracy Day .
The first - ever American election in 1789 was an undemocratic shambles .
Only 10 states took part .
The New York legislature chose no electors .
North Carolina and Rhode Island failed to ratify the Constitution in time .
But the vote went ahead and was won by a certain George Washington .
The first election to be tied was the 1800 stand - off between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr .
The winner was chosen by the House of Representatives : it was Jefferson by a margin of 10 - 4 .
The first party to hold a convention to nominate a candidate for president and vice - president was neither Democrat nor Republican .
It was the Anti-Masonic Party in 1831 .
Sadly , it never appeared again on ballot papers after 1831 .
Every US president has been a married man , with one exception – bachelor James Buchanan in 1856 .
Only one president has been a divorced man – Ronald Reagan .
The most unlucky presidential candidate in history was Horace Greeley , a distinguished journalist , editor of the New York Tribune , anti-slavery reformer and founder of the Liberal Republican Party .
In 1872 , he stood as presidential candidate against Ulysses S Grant , whom he perceived as corrupt .
He lost in a landslide .
Then his wife died .
Greeley went insane with grief and died in November 1872 , before he could receive his 66 elector votes .
They were scattered among the four other candidates .
A long time – 136 years , in fact – before Hillary Clinton came on the scene , women were contesting the presidency .
Victoria Woodhull ran for office in 1872 .
Jeanette Rankin of Montana was the first woman elected to Congress in 1916 .

Black people holding political office is n't a 21st - or even 20th - century phenomenon .
In 1855 , John Mercer Langston became the first elected black politician in the US , when he became town clerk in Brownhelm , Ohio .
Whoever wins on 4 November will be the 44th President of the United States of America .
But in fact , America has had only 42 presidents .
Why the discrepancy ?
The troublemaker is Grover Cleveland , who was elected president in 1884 , lost the re-election in 1888 , but re-won the presidency in 1892 .
In the annals of US power , he is counted twice , as 22nd and 24th holder of supreme office .
Shortly after Grover Cleveland 's accession to power , in 1893 , he discovered a malignant tumour on the roof of his mouth .
It was no time to alarm the population : there was a currency - market crisis looming .
To avoid any panic , he and his doctors stole inside a cruise boat and performed instant surgery on his mouth .
The public were told that he was away on a fishing trip ( very reassuring ) .
Only one man has the distinction of becoming president and vice - president without being voted into either office .
Step forward Gerald Ford , who became veep on the resignation of Spiro Agnew , and president after the resignation of Richard Nixon .
The oldest president to win a presidential election was Reagan , who was 73 when he began his second term .
The youngest , at 43 , was John Fitzgerald Kennedy .
The US Marine Band has played at every inauguration ceremony since 1801 , when Jefferson became third US President .
One tune it invariably plays is " Hail to the Chief " , the official anthem of the President .
Its original lyrics , taken from " The Lady of the Lake " by Sir Walter Scott , were set to music by James Sanderson in 1821 .
They began : " Hail to the chief who in triumph advances / Honor 'd and blest be the evergreen pine . "
Later they were rewritten by Albert Gamse to read : " Hail to the chief we have chosen for the nation / Hail to the chief !
We salute him one and all . "
It was first sung to announce the arrival of the President at the inauguration of James J Polk in 1845 , and has been used as the greeting music ever since .
The most closely contested election in US history was in 2000 .
Al Gore won the popular vote , by 50,996,582 to George W Bush 's 50,465,062 .
The result in Florida was declared " too close to call " , and the vote recount was stopped by the US Supreme Court , who awarded Bush all of Florida 's 25 electoral votes , securing him victory by 271-255 .
Iowa State coach Gene Chizik has been hired as the next football coach at Auburn , Iowa State athletic director Jamie Pollard said in a statement on Saturday .
" Gene [ Chizik ] confirmed for me today that he is accepting the head coaching position at Auburn , " Pollard said .
" I 'm disappointed for our Iowa State fans and student - athletes that he has chosen to leave our program after only two seasons .
" I understand that it [ Auburn ] is a dream job for him , but the timing and the way it played out has been hurtful and disappointing .
Although this is a significant set back , we will get through the challenge because the Iowa State University athletics program is far greater than one person . "
Chizik will be formally introduced Monday as Auburn 's football coach .
A former Auburn defensive coordinator , Chizik will succeed Tommy Tuberville , who resigned following 10 seasons .
The hiring was first reported by several media outlets , including AuburnUndercover.com , the Birmingham News and the Mobile Press - Register .

Your history of US Airways is incorrect .
US Airways is still in existence .
US Airways Express is a wholly own commuter subsidiary of US Airways .
In 2005 America West Airlines bought out US Airways preventing a 3rd ( and most likely fatal ) trip into bankruptcy .
The executives of AWA thought the larger carriers name had “ better recognition ” so they kept the name despite all the negatives associated with it .
admin said on November 16th , 2008 at 5:53 pm :
Thank you for your comment , Jerry .
I think you ’re referring to Allegheny Airlines , and there I was referring to its progression as USAir and then to US Air Express .
US Airways still flies planes with the Allegheny logo on its tail , and I agree that it is not defunct .
I had n’t known about America West buying out US Airways , however .
Thank you !
CactusAnnie said on November 20th , 2008 at 1:40 am :
Interesting collection of old “ friends ” here .
BTW , Muse Air ’s demise was NOT bankruptcy .
We were liquidated by Southwest Airlines .
And yes , they did give us pink slips and told all of us to “ hit the road ” .
( Contrary to their denials of ever ‘ laying off ’ anyone … .
woody grady said on February 20th , 2009 at 2:36 pm :
The Piedmont DC - 3 is now fully restored and flying .
Located at NC Transportation Muesum .
Greg said on April 24th , 2009 at 2:55 pm :
Not sure if you want to split hairs here , but technically Allegheny Airlines is not defunt .
While it was rebranded as UsAir , then UsAirways , part and parcel it ’s still the core of UsAirways .
Allegheny aquired Mohawk , PSA , Lake Central and Piedmont .
2nd point depending on who you talk to “ east ” or “ west ” either USairways is defunct ( except the name ) as America West bought them and saved them .
Or America
West is defunct as Usairways merged with them .
mike said on June 24th , 2009 at 8:39 am :
Found your sight on Google and must say I loved reading the info and comments .
The pictures brought back many memories from my childhood and often wondered what happened to some of these airlines that just seem to “ disappear ” … .
Bob said on June 30th , 2009 at 11:09 pm :
This brings back a lot of memories .
Still several missing that I worked for .
Air New England , Precison Airlines , Five Star Airlines , Bar Harbor , and Allstar Airlines .
Plus does anyone else remember the “ Yellowbirds ” ?
I think they were part of , or a gimick for Northeast .

I ’m trying to find out the name of an old airline , now out of business , that was owned by an American Indian .
Anyone old enough to help me ?
Larry said on August 7th , 2010 at 5:10 pm :
Nice compilation but you missed a few … .
The former West Coast Airlines , Pacific Airlines and Bonanza airlines were acquired by Howard Hughes in the late 1960s ( as I recall ) and merged together as Hughes Air West .
Hughes Air West was subsequently merged with North Central and Southern to form Republic Airlines .
There was also Pride Air , an airline started by a group of former Continental Pilots after the 1982 strike .
It was based in New Orleans and flew 727s .
Finally , another of the early deregulation fatalities were Air One and MGM Grand whose ‘ First Class ’ business model did not last a full year .
They flew 727s and DC - 8s respectively .
Robert Wright said on August 8th , 2010 at 3:51 pm :
I remember all these companies .
When I first got on with Delta in 1961 I was in LAX , and then SAN .
I remember when PSA ( Pacific SouthWest Airline ) started put wwith only four Lockhead Electra ’s )
Pete Zamoyski said on August 9th , 2010 at 10:57 am :
The picture of the Air Florida B737 , if I am seeing it correctly , is N62AF a B737 - 200 Basic with JT8 - 9A engines , this was the Palm 90 aircraft that crashed in Washington D.C. on January 13 , 1982 .
If it is n’t , then it is N52AF a B737 - 200 Advanced with JT8 - 15 engines .
Pete Zamoyski said on August 9th , 2010 at 11:00 am :
The caption regarding Midway Airlines is incorrect , the Airline was certified and began operations November 1979 , I should know , I was one of the original employees of the Airlines .
We had a GREAT time , unfortunately they went out of business after buying the Philadelphia operation of Eastern Airlines .
Sandy Blanchette said on August 9th , 2010 at 9:13 pm :
I worked for Jet America for a short time in Las Vegas .
I trained in Long Beach , CA and I think that was their home base .
What happened to them ?
Bob S said on August 10th , 2010 at 6:40 pm :
you left out flying tigers .
great memories .. thanks
admin said on August 10th , 2010 at 7:52 pm :
Apparently Jet America , which ran between 1981 and 1987 , was bought out by and merged into Alaska Airlines in late 1986 .
Somewhat ironically a similarly - named JetAmerica was supposed to provide $ 9 flights out of Tampa in 2009 but never made it off the ground .
Mark said on August 11th , 2010 at 6:16 am :
One that would be nice to see in this article is North East Airlines .
The infamous “ Yellowbirds ” .
Bob Cassidy said on August 11th , 2010 at 8:22 am :
Sure are a bunch of them are n’t there .
I was with Eastern from 64 until its demise .
Any news lately about its restart ?
Linda Micu said on August 11th , 2010 at 8:35 am :

Thanks so much
Gary Miller said on August 11th , 2010 at 4:13 pm :
I worked for Ozark Air Lines , as a ramp rat in the late 60 ’s & 70’s , they were later bought by TWA and then to American .
I might have some old pictures of the Ozark DC - 3 , FH227 and DC - 9 laying around somewhere .
Later I flew for Mississippi Valley Airlines , they merged into Air Wisconsin Airlines in 1985 .
Aspen Airways merged into Air Wisconsin in 1992 .

While Delta acquired some of PanAm ’s assets , most of them were acquired by United .
In February 1986 , United assumed Pan Am ’s entire Pacific Division .
Unite acquried most of the Atlantic and Latin American Divisions of PanAm in in 1991 .
Joe Nedich said on August 14th , 2010 at 11:24 am :

Deregulation leaves a heap of destruction .
The only three pictured that I see going “ defunct ” prior to deregulation of the airline industry in the USA are Central , Capital , and Mohawk .
Ken said on August 14th , 2010 at 8:42 pm :
National Air;ines did not go Bankrupt they were bought by Pan Am in 1980 – Pan Am went under because Delta Airlines back out of its Buy out in Dec 1992 – Delta gave some of Pan Am Employees A job .
J Border said on August 14th , 2010 at 11:06 pm :
Very interesting , but a couple comments ….
I think Republic became Hughes Airwest or merged with another airline to become that .
Then Hughes merged with Northwest at sometime after that …not United .
Gerry Crouse said on August 14th , 2010 at 11:14 pm :
CP Air and Wardair are missing as well as Eastern Provincial
Sunnie said on August 15th , 2010 at 1:21 am :
Why did you not include Northeast Airlines ?
The jets were famouly call “ Yellowbitds ” due to the yellow underbelly and tail .
It originallly started sometime in the 30’s I believe as a cropduster airline in Monroe , LA .
Would love to see a piece on it and a picture .
Thanks .
Doug Martin said on August 15th , 2010 at 10:36 am :

Ross Aimer said on August 15th , 2010 at 12:32 pm :
Wow , great job and thanks for the memories !
I worked for a few of these airlines and a few others not mentioned here !
There were around 300 airlines after “ deregulation ” that flew West and became a sad chapter in airline history books .
One of the airlines mentioned here is Tower Air .
I was the # one Captain on the seniority list when I was fired by the owner Moris Nakhtomi for “ union activities ! ”
He would always threaten to shut the airline down if we ever became unionized .
He finally did what he had promised .
After stealing $ 50 Million from the coffers !
The majority of these airlines went under because of bad or dishonest management .

Skip of NCA said on August 15th , 2010 at 7:22 pm :
# 1 Yellow Birds were North East to become part of Delta
# 2 West Coast / Pacific / AirWest joined to become Air West , later HUGHES Air West then merged with Republic Air which ealier was created by merger of North Central & Southern .
# 3 North Central air was renamed from Wisconsin Central ( Wiskey Air ) , started by FWD of Clintonville WI .
# 4 Texas Intl was renamed from Trans - Texas .
# 5 The TWA Midway Airport folks arrived one morning to find a Constellation a / c missing from its previous night ramp .
Seems Howard Hughes needed to leave MDW , so he piloted out his big 4 - engine plane .
# 6 The May 1960 Official Airline Guide has USofA schedules for 13 Trunk , 13 Local Service Carriers & 3 Helicoper lines ( NYC / CHI / LAX ) , plus some Intl Lines .
Today of those 29 USofA air carriers , absent ‘ re - branding , etc’ , only 4 remain under their 1960 names .

Started work at PHF 2 Jan 1959 , with Capital
airlines , we had nothing that ran under its own
power ….
We had DC3s and DC4s , but we were so proud to working for an airline ….. airport was also served by National and Piedmont … .
National had Convairs and later Electras , Piedmont had DC3
and made one engine stops ….
Lots of fun back then , nothing like today …
Ed Meyer said on August 16th , 2010 at 4:58 pm :
I got my start with Capital , then to United , onto the advertising business as a NYC “ Mad Man ” on the following accounts — Eastern , TWA , National , Flying Tigers , and Tower Air .
What a life !!
On the Eastern account we went through 425 people in three years , including six VPs , mostly because of burn out or they did n’t pick up on the rythum of the account and quickly fit in .
One CEO said , “ this is a product that can kill you ” ( aircraft crashes ) and these were the “ gun slinger ” days of airline management .
Brilliant and decisive tough guys .
Too bad they ’re gone .

Dave Nichols said on August 17th , 2010 at 12:27 pm :
Whoa Nellie !
You have got some “ facts ” way off .
First , Allegheny rebranded as US Air , period .
Express was and is a separate franchised commuter setup , controlled by Allegheny .
Piedmont merged into US Air .
Central Airlines was very profitable when it was acquired by Frontier .
I wrote the history of that airline .
The majority owner of Central saw a big profit and sold all his shares outright to Frontier ’s parent company .
Dave Nichols said on August 17th , 2010 at 12:30 pm :
I think you will find that National Airlines ( the original National in the sun colors ) did not go bankrupt .
I believe they were hostily taken over by Pan Am so the latter could get an instant domestic route system .
Byron Alexander said on August 17th , 2010 at 12:31 pm :
I used to be a flight attendaont on two defunct airlines .
Forth Worth Airlines .
We operated out of Mecham Field in Fort Worth Texas .
The old Braniff execs ran it , which why we only lasted for 9 months .
We had a fleet of 4 YS - 11’s .
Three of them flew while we robbed the 4th for parts .
After bankruptacy , our flight crews were picked up by Mid Pacific Air .
They moved us from Fort Worth to Las Vegas .
Again using our old YS - 11s , they wanted to be a low cost competitor to PSA , as gambling run airline .
It did n’t last long .
YS - 11s are cheap to fly for a 60 passenger plane , but they are slow !
Ca n’t compete with a jet .

Phil Stallings said on August 17th , 2010 at 2:28 pm :
I began flying for Central Airlines in 1964 .
I see “ Cause and result of demise : Bankruptcy .
Sold to Frontier Airlines . ”
I would like to correct that ….
Central did not file bankruptcy … Central was purchased and merged with Frontier Airlines in 1967 .
Paul Murray said on August 17th , 2010 at 2:28 pm :
Allegehny – US Air – US Airways
“ Operated : 1952 – 1979
Cause and result demise : Rebranded as USAirways , then US Airways Express and then into Piedmont Airlines . ”
The order of secession is wrong .
Prior to Allegehny I think it was ( AAA ) All American Airways , then Allegehny , then US Air , Then several mergers ( Mohawk - Piedmont - PSA ) , then the name change to US AIRWAYS , then two bankruptcies , then the merger with America West .

Other airlines that I can think of not on your list are : Zantop , Seaboard World , Flying Tigers ,
There also was another Capital other than the one that merged with United .

How could you forget Chicago & Southern Airlines which merged into Delta ineither 1952 or ’ 53 ?
They operated “ Dixieliner Service from Chicago through the Mississippi Valley to N.O. and into the Carribbean .
They operated DC - 3 , Convair 340 , and Lockheed Constellations at the time of the merger and I think had an interchange with TWA operating Martin 404 ’s Detroit to Houston .
They had pilot bases at Memphis , which was headquarters , New Orleans and if I ’m right about the TWA interchange , a very small base at Houston .
Ken said on August 17th , 2010 at 8:51 pm :
Hey ,
I was a pilot for Southern Airways , Republic Airlines , Northwest Airlines and Delta .
I notice that Hughes Air West ( several remarked on that omission , I see ) and Northwest did not make the list !
Why not ?
DEFUNCT !

In the mid 90’s I worked for Private Jet out of Atlanta .
They flew a 727 and leased new MD - 80 ’s to fly tourists to the Caribbean and Mexico .
They semed to do a great business in the winter months always flying full out of Chicago .
I believe this charter outfit was started by former Eastern employees .
Even though it was a new upstart
It was a good company to work for for the short time I was with them .

Thanks for the memories .
Enjoyed them all .
Some others you may want to add to the lore :
• Seaboard World Airways , acquired by Flying Tigers in 1980 ; Tigers in turn acquired by FedEx in 1988 .
• Ozark ( 2nd incarnation ) operated 2 Dornier Do-328 turboprops as Great Plains Airlines , based in Tulsa , OK , from 2001 to 2004 .
• Skybus Airlines , an ultra -low - cost airline with a unique business model , based in Columbus , OH , operated 12 Airbus A319s from 10/07 until they ceased operation in 4/08 .
Jim Gross said on August 18th , 2010 at 1:04 am :
AirCal was a growing , successful airline when it was merged into AA in 1987 .
It never ceased operations and was hiring pilots & flight attendants at the time of the merger .
Three other airlines ( USAir , which bought PSA ) , Delta ( which bought Western ) , and Continental were looking to buy AirCal during that period .
Robert Crandall of AA said he bought AirCal so nobody else could .

National Airlines did not fail because of bankruptcy .
It had one of the healthiest balance sheets in the industry .
Pan
Am , who wanted a domestic system , paid a very high price for a very successful domestic and international airline .
Subsequently , Pan
Am sold off various international routes before the last of it was integrated into Delta .
Their are a lot of erroneous statements throughout this site , foremost of which , was Allegheny was re-branded as US Airways and then US Airways Express .
Allegheny merged with US Air. Also Piedmont Airlines also merged with US Air( ways ) .
Piedmont Aviation was also the parent company of Piedmont Airlines and operated after the merger .
Moreover , Texas International did not take over Continental .
The latter took over Texas International during the early years of Southwest Airlines rise to the top .
I am not aware of Presidential merging with Pan Am .
There were numerous other airlines not mentioned such as America West , Action , Precision , Business Express , Bar Harbor , Command , PBA , Best , Marco Island , Naples , Florida Express and Florida West , Air Atlanta , ATA , American International , Air Caribbean , Bonanza , West Coast , Jetstream , Northeastern International , Carnival , Skywest , and Hughes Air West , Jet Express , Leisure Air , Legend , Mackey , Panagra , Pro Air , Pioneer , Ransome , Reeve Aleutian , Wien , and Sunworld International , just to name a few .
In all , one might double the number cited above ( see “ Defunct airlines ” on Wikopedia .

Thanks for bringing back some old and very fond memories from my 29 plus years in the airline business .
During those years , I wrote or typed most of the 2 letter airline codes of these carriers to book reservations or write tickets .
Funny how most have stuck in my mind and I ’ve been retired 15 years .
I started my career with American Airlines at GSW ( Fort Worth ) and ended it at our ticketing headquarters built on the same property nearby .
Most of my life long friends have an airline background and I cherish those days of shared experiences .
Please correct and maintain this interesting website so we can visit our old friends often .
By the way , I did not see Swift Air ( out of California ) listed .

You forgot MarkAir , the airline whose intense competition caused Alaska Airlines to cut back permanently on Alaska ’s fantastic meal services .
I was on the Long Beach to Seattle AS run the morning in 1992 that AS notified its crew and passengers that meals would now be ordinary , not extraordinary .
A truly sad day .
From Wikipedia :
The airline began its life as Interior Airways in the late 1940s carrying cargo throughout the state of Alaska .
In the late 1960s the airline bought Lockheed L- 382 Hercules aircraft to service construction of the Alaska Pipeline .
In the 1970s it changed its name to Alaska International Air to reflect its international charter business .
In 1982 Alaska International Air bought a regional passenger / cargo airline named Great Northern .
In 1984 new colors and the name MarkAir ( reportedly named after a newsboy named Mark ) were brought to the airline as it inaugurated passenger / cargo service from Anchorage to the Alaska bush communities of Barrow , Bethel , Dillingham , Fairbanks , King Salmon , Kotzebue , Nome , and Prudhoe Bay / Deadhorse .
The airline had purchased Boeing 737-200 combination cargo / passenger aircraft to operate these services .
In the mid-1980s MarkAir and Alaska Airlines entered into a codesharing agreement with MarkAir operating as Alaska Airlines to the communities of Dillingham , Dutch Harbor , Barrow , Aniak , St. Mary ’s and Alaska Airlines feeding MarkAir from its routes from Seattle and other “ lower 48 ” destinations .
In the late 1980s MarkAir bought several air taxis ( airlines operating small six to nine seat aircraft from larger communities such as Bethel to Alaska ’s Native villages ) and purchased several Beechcraft 1900 aircraft ; and under the name of MarkAir Express operated new service from Anchorage to Cordova , Aniak , McGrath , Dillingham , King Salmon , Galena , Unalakleet , Kodiak , Kenai , Homer and Valdez .
By 1990 MarkAir was the State of Alaska ’s largest airline .[ citation needed ]
In 1990 , Alaska Airlines abruptly cancelled its codesharing agreement with MarkAir and MarkAir inaugurated service to key Alaska Airlines markets such as Anchorage - Seattle , Anchorage - Juneau - Sitka - Ketchikan - Seattle , Seattle - Los Angeles , Seattle - San Francisco and Seattle - Portland .
In 1992 the airline expanded its Lower 48 route network to include Seattle - Chicago / Midway and Denver .
However the head - to - head competition with Alaska Airlines caused MarkAir to find itself in bankruptcy by the end of 1992 .
In 1993 MarkAir restructured itself as a “ low fare ” carrier and cut most routes out of Seattle with the exception of Seattle - Anchorage and Seattle - Los Angeles .
The airline began a hub in Denver and serviced various West Coast , Midwest and Southern cities .[ citation needed ]
In 1994 city and business officials from Denver , Colorado hoped to persuade MarkAir to move its headquarters to Denver . [ 2 ]
In 1995 faced with bankruptcy again , the airline cut all jet services within the state of Alaska and concentrated on its Denver hub , the new MarkAir headquarters .
[ 3 ]
MarkAir Express continued services within the State of Alaska taking over all of MarkAir ’s jet routes .
In 1996 MarkAir was forced to shut down .
MarkAir Express remained until 1997 and was reorganized into the all - cargo carrier Alaska Central Express .
MarkAir ’s assets were purchased in bankruptcy by the private equity firm Wexford Capital Management , the majority owners in control of the present day Republic Airways Holdings . [ 4 ]
Jim Radcliffe said on August 18th , 2010 at 2:46 pm :
Your reason for demise on National Airlines is incorrect .
You listed Bankruptcy then merged with Pan Am. National did not go bankrupt .
Instead , it was a highly profitable airline that Pan Am acquired , which itself later went bankrupt .
National Airlines itself was a thriving carrier until Pan Am took over .
Pan Am ’s managers ’ mindset was international and did n’t know how to compete domestically – and the Lockerbie crash put them out of business

Actually , Reno Air began operations on 1July1992 .
Great airline and really fabulous people ( many of whom were Midway Airlines orphans ) .
I was associated with it from inception to final integration with AA .
I retired from AA in 2006 after the company closed the Reno MX facility .
Everyone at Reno Air had a real “ can do ” attitude from Capt .
Bob Reding ( CEO ) all the way down to the least paid staff member .
It was a real pleasure and honor to work with everyone at Reno Air and American Airlines .

Wayne Farrar said on August 18th , 2010 at 11:06 pm :
Two corrections …
Frontier Airlines , it was aquired by Texas Air which owned Continental Airlines , it was then merged into Continental along with Peoples express and New York Air .
Texas International was also wentr into the CO name .
National Airlines , Texas
Air bought ( I believe ) Ten Million Dollars of shares of National and
made an offer for to buy National but they
chose Pan Am instead .
Texas
Air sold shares to Pan Am , for a profit then they went after Continental .
That money that Frank Lorenzo used was ( earned for Texas International being on strike 11/74 til 3/75 .

J R Williams said on August 19th , 2010 at 1:22 am :
I began my “ big ” airplane flying with East Coast Aviation that flew DC - 3 ’s out of Washington National .
It was formed by some Capital pilots who did n’t want to go to United when they were bought out .
That was in 1963 – from there I went to Hawaiian where I flew until my retirement in 1994 .
While flying between HNL and SFO we had a number of communications problems with an air carrier who started and failed in just a few years .
They were called Air Hawaii and they used the same flight numbers as our Hawaiian Air .
On one flight from HNL to SFO , I was asked to call OAK center on a land - line when I landed .
I did so and was asked why I did n’t fly the flight plan that I had accepted .
It turned out that the culprit was the pilot of Air Hawaii 12 and not us – Hawaiian Air 12 .
Air Hawaii did n’t last too long .

It ceased operations , in 1973 , do to low Load Factors .
The airline flew Twin Otters .
Chuck Maire said on August 19th , 2010 at 10:25 am :
Wow , I have seen some interesting histories here about US Airways .
Allegheny Airlines merged with Mohawk I believe in the late 60s .
It rebranded itself as UsAir in 1977 or so .
It had established the feeder system of Allegheny Commuters in the 70s .
I flew for one of them .
It later merged with PSA and Piedmont and retained it ’s name then changed to US Airways under Steven Wolf .
America
West bought US Airways several years ago and kept the name US Airways which better fit the operations mission .
Piedmont is one of the feeders for US Airways but is not the same company as the one which merged with US Air .
I think I have that all correct .
I am sure if not someone will tell me .
Also , North Central merged with Southern in 1979 to become Republic .
In 1980 it merged with Hughes Airwest .
In 1986 we merged with Northwest Orient to become Northwest .
Now we are Delta .
I started in 1978 with North Central and now fly for Delta after 4 mergers .

Re : Pan Am ’s demise .
The high price paid for National was not the major cause of Pan Am ’s failure though there are some who like to make that claim .
In his book , Pan Am : An Aviation Legend , Barnaby Conrad contends that the collapse of the original Pan Am was a combination of corporate mismanagement , government indifference to protecting its prime international carrier , and flawed regulatory policy .
Pan
Am had huge bond issues in the market that paid between 8.5 and 12.5 % interest .
It is not possible to survive with that kind of debt load .

Joe Vilmain said on August 19th , 2010 at 9:48 pm :
Just a couple of observations :
I would question National being the “ first exclusively jet powered air service in the US ” ?
The claim for Chicago Air and the Fokker F - 27 may be correct but I do n’t think the picture is of a F - 27 ( my recall is the F - 27 was an overwing aircraft operated in large part by Ozark Airlines .
Finally , to limit the comments about TWA to the “ moon ” thing in California is sad – this was the airline of “ firsts ” and truly the airline of the stars – there are so many stories to be told about TWA that this page would have trouble holding them – a proud airline and proud employees .
George Nash said on August 19th , 2010 at 11:11 pm :
I remember one that is not included .

The airline initially only had S.A. routes as far north as Panama as Pan Am ’s interests were the east coast of S.A. to the U.S. .
Later PANAGRA operated flights all the way up to N.Y. and as far west as San Fracisco
They were acquired by Braniff ( 1969 ) .
It would be nice to see them on your site !

Many fond memories of my husband ’s 37 years with United .
Recall some nicknames –Teeny Weeny for TWA , Bring Over American Cash for BOAC , Air Chance for Air France , and I still use the phrase “ blue room ” for a bathroom .
Fun and interesting site .
Thanks .

WOW–THIS WAS VERY INTERESTING READ ..I AM AN EX EASTERN AIRLINE EMPLOYEE ….IT SURE DID MAKE ME THINK OF A LOT OF THINGS THAT HADN’T CROSSED MY MIND IN SEVERAL YEARS & I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT !!!
THANKS AGAIN …..
Jared Howe said on August 21st , 2010 at 3:06 pm :
I am tired of hearing that Eastern went out of business because of bankruptcy .
Eastern was put out of business by Frank Lorenzo on purpose .
He destroyed Eastern to build up his other Scam operated Airline , Continental .
He put Eastern into Bankruptcy and Liquidated the assets .
Continental at the time was the countries 14th largest airline .
Eastern was the countries 2nd largest airline .
He took from Eastern ( a Unionized carrier ) and moved assets to Continental ( non-union ) and built them up the nations 5th largest in size while destroying Eastern .
What Continental did n’t want or could n’t use , Lorenzo sold off to other carriers like American , Donald Trump , etc .
The Eastern Shuttle for example is now split between Delta and USAir .
Put them both together and it was the Eastern Shuttle .
I worked for Eastern for 18 years , and retired from British Airways …
Eastern did n’t go bankrupt by itself ….
it was put in bankruptcy on purpose and liquidated for Continental ’s benefit .
All Continental is today is Eastern without the Eastern people .
I hope the merger of Continental and United goes well , but I want the Continental name to disapper .
Do I sound bitter ….????
Yes .
I am .
Eastern was a great airline with great people .
Lorenzo , I hope you rot in hell you S.O.B .

I was Delta ’s District Sales Manager at EWR from 1966 until 1992 .
Your site really brings back some great memories of a much happier time in the airline industry .
Back when , although their was fierce competition between carriers , there was also a very strong bond and sincere camaraderie between all airline employees .
You would do all you could to steal away airline X’s and airline Y’s passengers during the day and then meet airline X’s and airline Y’s folks after work for a softball game and a few beers .
Thank you very much for sharing this site with we former airline folks .

I want to thank you for all the research that has supported my empirical suppositions :
I personally , have managed during a somewhat sporadic career , to steer into the bankruptcy morass , three , count em three , of these fine dinosaurs of aviation endeavors : Pan Am ( Aka pandemonium ) NWA ( Aka cobra airlines , we strike at anything ) and finally good ole EAL ( Why yes , I can run an Airline , Friendly Frank and the guy from American AA and Airtran , forklift Joe . )

Couple more goners for you –
I saw a letter mention a mainland Mid Pacific Airways – They also flew YS - 11s in Hawaii mid-late 80s , now long gone .
SPIA South Pacific International Airways ( Airlines ? )
Same time period had 2 beautiful 707s out of Honolulu plus Twin Otters in Samoa .
I also would like to see a little more detailed history in your great lineup .
Those were super days .
Thanks .

A neighbor ( and Mom ) of one of my childhood friends was a former Air Hostess for Trans World Airlines back in their “ glory days ” , circa mid -
1940 - ‘s .
She told fascinating stories to us kids about the many celebs she ’d met in the course of her “ air hostess ” duties including the Big Band singer Johnny Desmond who remained one of their cherished family friends .
My neighbor said the “ pet name ” for TWA was “ Teeny Weenie Airlines ” !
I was almost convinced that commercial air travel would grind to a halt when “ the BIG one ” TWA stopped service several years ago .
Had almost the same reaction when PAN - AM quit , too .
Guess it did n’t “ make the going great ” after a while !
Everything changes , I guess .
Thanks for the memory stirrers .
Susan said on August 22nd , 2010 at 12:38 am :
What about Air Atlanta ?
Great airline , with real china , your own crystal salt / pepper shakers , competitive pricing , and a free RT ticket for every five you bought … probably why they went under !
pete said on August 22nd , 2010 at 2:00 am :
As I remember , Chalks Airlines of Miami , FL had service to the Bahamas & flew only Grumman amhibs : the Goose , Mallard ( piston & turbo - prop ) & in later years , the “ G - SA - 16/G-111 “ Albatross ” .
An inflight failure of a “ Mallard ” wing ended Chalks Airlines a few years ago .
Air Florida began with a single B707/720 with service from PIE - MIA and quickly got a few Lockheed “ Electras ” before procuring B737s ( some from UA ) & B727s .
At one point , they had ex AS & BI B727s in use .
They also had a couple of DC - 10s for MIA - LGW service .
After the demise of AF , the B737 operation formed the core of ML ’s MIA / FLL base .
In 1989 , ML purchased Chap .
11 EAL ’s PHL hub & approximately DC9 - 31s from aviation ’s ‘ dear friend ’ Frank L.
The ex-EA DC9 - 31s powered by JT8 - D - 7 engines could not fly a full pax load to NYC / PHL / DCA out of MDW on hot summer days .
EA had a group of 25 B - 727-200s , owned by Greyhoud Bus Lines , which were powered by JT8 - D - 7 engines .
On a hot summer day , with a full 12/137 pax load , they could not make it non-stop from DCA - ATL and would flag stop in RIC for fuel !
Talk about economy .
Scott Crosier said on August 22nd , 2010 at 3:13 am :
Another airline to be added :
USAfrica Airways .
For some basic information , see Wikipedia as follows :
USAfrica Airways
US Africa Airways was a United States based airline that operated flights between Washington Dulles International Airport ( then called Dulles International Airport ) and Johannesburg in starting in June , 1994 .
[1 ]
Flights refueled in the Cape Verde Islands .
Later , once a week flights were added to Cape Town , which also refueled in the Cape Verde Islands .
The airline was the first U.S. airline flying only international routes since the U.S. airline industry was deregulated in 1978 .
The airline operated flights from June 1994 to February 3 , 1995 . [ 2 ]
It leased two McDonnell Douglas MD - 11 aircraft from American Airlines , registered as N1757A and N1757B . [ 3 ]
Brian Campbell said on August 22nd , 2010 at 10:10 am :
Midway Airlines was formed in 1976 but it did not operate until it flew its first revenue flight on November 1 , 1979 .
I would mention that Midway was the first scheduled airline to be federally certificated after deregulation was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Carter .
Bruce said on August 22nd , 2010 at 12:00 pm :
Magnificent compilation .
You shud make a book out of it .
A nice coffee - table tome !
I ’d add a few lines about each airline ’s major routes .
Missing : Provincetown - Boston Airline ( no “ s ” in Airline ) .
Flew the amazing DC - 3 right up to the end .
Moved its entire operation to Florida during the winter .
Robert Hardisty said on August 22nd , 2010 at 12:38 pm :
It will be interesting to see your write - up about Continental Airlines and United .
United Airlines keeping ther name for the Airline , The Continental Airlines LOGO on the tail ( for how long nobody knows ) , and the Continental Airlines CEO taking over the raines !
Now this is going to be a combination that is going to interesting ..
Being an X Continental Airlines employee I feel bad that the Continental image will soon be lost into what is shown above , but never forgotten !

This really brings back memories having been a travel agent for the past 28 years , plus having a Dad who worked at Pan Am from 1938 to 1978 .
I have n’t read everybodys comments , so forgive me if this has been shared , but from this list I do n’t see World Airways or Wien Air Alaska mentioned .

Couple of other missing … Southeast that flew from MIA to the Fla Keys .
The best of all , Chalk Airlines that flew from MIA to the Bahamas .
Chall operated sea planes of various types and flew by the seat of their pants and dead reckoning .
What a fun ride .
TWA was absoutely the best , but was so terribly mismanaged from Hughs forward .
We did it because we were great employees who could do anything with nothing .
I miss them all .
Werner Meyer said on August 22nd , 2010 at 2:08 pm :

Fascinating and well done , obviously some editing ( per folks ’ comments ) , but congratulations on a ton of research .
My Dad flew for TACA and then Morgan Airlines ( Honduras ) 1932 – 34 , returned home and was Captain with TWA 1938 – 47 .
Quit TWA in disgust over their mismanagement of international operations .
Thanks for the photo ’s and good stories ; and for including allthose comments …
Might be interesting to do similar effort on the airlines that have SURVIVED for these many years , too !
God bless ,

Pierre J. Haan said on August 22nd , 2010 at 3:52 pm :
I would like to add a few more :
Lake Central Airlines , which was merged into Allegheny airlines in 1968 .
Colonial Airlines which was merged into Eastern Airlines in 1956 .
Seaboard World Airlines , an all cargo airline which started out as Seaboard & Western , which was merged into the all cargo airline Flying Tigers , which also no longer exists to - day .
I am a retired engineer ; and I worked at all 3 of these airlines .
R Neal said on August 22nd , 2010 at 5:33 pm :
You left out Bonanza Air Lines , Pacific Air Lines and West Coast Airlines , which merged to become AirWest and then became Hughes
Air West
John said on August 22nd , 2010 at 5:52 pm :
Great pictures of some great airlines .
World Airways is another I think left out .
You could get a great deal here in Australia buying a combination Continental ? world fare to London .
Calstate is another smaller defunct , and I guess Northwest Orient should get a mention , along with American Trans Air .
I have doubts about TWA closing in 1991 .
Certainly there were TW / AA codeshare flights through St Louis operating later than that .
And as for Pan Am I believe the weight of their frequent flier scheme was a major influence in their demise .
They were filling huge chunks of their loads with freebies and this was making their yields unprofitable .
Paul Talbott said on August 22nd , 2010 at 5:58 pm :
A couple of Delta corrections :
Delta started their crop dusting operations in Macon , GA , then moved to Monroe , LA as it was more centrally located .
They were originally known as Huff - Daland Dusters , then became Delta Air Service .
C & S merged with Delta on 1 May 1953 not 1957 .
C & S began life as Pacific Seaboard on the west coast flying Bellancas .
C & S never operated any CV - 340’s .
At the time of the merger they were operating DC - 3 ’s & Connies .
Delta sold the C & S Connies to Pacific Northern Airlines which was purchased by Western Air Lines , who also operated them .
Northeast Air Lines merged with Delta in 1972 .
At the time they were flying B-727- 95 & 295’s , DC - 9 - 31 ’s & FH - 227 C’s .
All operated in Delta markings .
Roy Lecker said on August 22nd , 2010 at 6:08 pm :
Empire Airlines operated out of Boise , Idaho in 1946 then merged with West Coast Airlines in Seattle in the early 1950 ’s which was owned and operated by Alaska fisherman named Nick Bez .
West Coast started with 13 DC - 3’s and later added F - 27 aircraft in 1958 .
In 1962 , West Coast added 4 Piper 31 and in 1965 West Coast added 4 Douglas DC - 9=10 aircraft .
West Coast , Pacific , and Bonaza Air;ines merged to make Air West in 1968 which was purchased by Hushes in 1971 .
Hushes Air West was Sold to Republic Air Lines in 1980 which was made up of North Central , Southern , and Hushes Air West .
Republic was then sold to Northwest Airlines .
History moves on .
David F LaRocque said on August 22nd , 2010 at 6:15 pm :
Re : TWA - Yes TWA had financial problems , but those problems were greatly exacerbated by the loss of TWA 800 on July 17 , 1996 .
Nobody who reads “ First Strike : TWA 800 and the Attack on America ” by Jack Cashill ; or listens to the interview with NYANG Major Fred Meyer ( former USN SAR pilot in Vietnam ) could remain in doubt about what happened to TWA Flight 800 .
It was shot down and this fact was concealed by the government in a massive cover - up .
TWA was shot down !
Paul said on August 22nd , 2010 at 6:44 pm :

It operated US to SJU via the islands and was acquired by Delta about 1951 or 52 .
Really enjoyed your project .
Good Luck !
David said on August 22nd , 2010 at 10:53 pm :
Hello …love your site .
If I may offer one correction , Allegheny rebranded into USAir , which later became USAirways , but it stopped there .
USAir did not rebrand into USAirways Express , nor Piedmont .
Piedmont was acquired by USAir in 1989 .
Thanks !
Efrain Cordero said on August 22nd , 2010 at 11:38 pm :
They fail to mention Caribair , that operated out of Puerto Rico , and eventually was purchased by EAL ……
pete said on August 22nd , 2010 at 11:52 pm :
Another SFL operation was Marco Island Airways which flew MIA - Marco Island to bring potential real estate purchasers to Marco Island in the 70s .
They flew a Martin 404 which was normally domiciled at Opa Locka .
Airlift of Miami operated for many years and used various types such as C - 46 , CV880/990 , B - 727 , L- 100 , DC - 8 .
Rich International was active for many years ( still might be ! ) and used C - 46s to supply the ancient USCG Loran “ A ” chain stations in San Salvador & South Caicos ; flew post Ch7 EAL L-1011s in charter service and well as a bit of scheduled flying ; they also has DC8 flying at one point .
Arrow Air flew cargo , some pax , & mil .
charters and lost a mil charter DC8 flight in Gander , Nfld .
Then there was Miami Air , a carrier which came out of the ashes of the final EAL BK 7 filing , some 2 years after the IAM strike .
Doug Rounds said on August 23rd , 2010 at 12:46 am :
You left out Lake Central Airlines .
Founded by Roscoe Turner ..
Roscoe tp keep his certificate founded Michigan Central Airlines which flew into Flint , Saginaw , Traverse City , Michigan once a year to keep the certificate issue after WWII .
He sold that route to Capital ( Untied ) when he founded Lake Central .
Lake Central Airlines was an airline that served points in the midwestern United States from 1950 to 1968 , when it was merged into Allegheny Airlines .
Founded as Roscoe Turner Airlines , the company was based at Weir - Cook Airport ( now Indianapolis International Airport ) in Indianapolis , IN .
It serviced communities principally in Michigan , Indiana , Ohio , West Virginia and Maryland .
It flew Douglas DC - 3 , Convair 340 , Convair 580 , and Nord 262 aircraft .
Roscoe aslso founded Michigan Central Airlines after WWII , whcih flew once a year to keep the certificate with a Stinson Voyager and a Cessna T - 50 ( Bamboo Bomber ) .
They flew to Detroit , Flint , Saginaw and Traverse City , Michigan .
He sold te route to Capital ( United )
Robert Booth said on August 23rd , 2010 at 12:48 am :
Many coomments .
For years United Airlines was spelled United Air Lines .
The Pan Am around the world flight over the North Pole also went over the South Pole .
The route was San Francisco – London – Cape Town – Auckland – San Francisco .
If you include small regional airlines , you missed Henson Aviation , Ransome Airlines , NewAir , and Pilgrim .
Also Colonial Airlines which operated DC - 3s from New York to Albany and Monreal and was bought by Eastern , in the late 1940s , I think , so that it could get a route to Motreal .
Beside Wien Alaska , there was also Reeve Aleutian in Alaska .
I noticed many of your omissions , then found most of them covered in the comments .
I worked for four airlines .
Only one is still operating .
However , I know a woman who was a flight attendant for nine airlines , all of which are now defunct !
The angel of death !
A great site and I wish you luck with it !
You ’ve got a subject here that will keep you busy for a long , long time !

From birth to shutdown , independence had the shortest lifespan of any airline in history , but operated 99 airplanes .
gerald marketos said on August 23rd , 2010 at 7:26 am :
You left out the original Empire Airlines founded by my family in 1945 .
It lasted until 1950 when they neglected to renew the mail franchise application .
( That ’s how they were subsidized . )
They started with about 8 UC - 78 ( T - 50 ) Bobcats and later had a fleet of D - 18 “ C ” model Beechcraft with 550 HP engines .
It was chartered as an intrastate airline with the hub at LaGuardia and serviced about 10 cities throughout New York State .
The Empire Airlines you have listed actually operated as Oneida County Aviation dba Empire Airlines as we still hold the trademark for Empire .
President Paul Quackenbush was a friend .
Russ said on August 23rd , 2010 at 11:54 am :
You forgot to mention “ Pacific Express ” it was an attempt by Pan Am as a low cost regional carrier .
It flew Bac 1 - 11 ’s and tried to buy some BAE - 146 .
It filed for Bankruptcy .
It was based out of Chico , Ca .
Marti Lungren said on August 23rd , 2010 at 12:05 pm :
Air West was formed by the only THREE way merger in the history of American aviation .
It was formed by Pacific Airlines out of SFO , West Coast out of Seattle and Bonanza out of PHX .
It was a mess initially but they did prevail .
Hughes bought them in late 1970 or 1971 .
They then became Hughes Air West .
The planes were all painted yellow and flight attendants wore yellow uniforms .
Republic Airlines was the result of a merger ( takeover ) of Southern Airways by North Central .
They later acquired Hughes Air West to further add to Republic Airlines .
wasyjrm was then bought by North was

Marti Lungren said on August 23rd , 2010 at 12:36 pm :
I was not able to continue with my history of Hughes Air West and Northwest .
In 1986 Northwest bought Republic .
NW\A was the strongest airline in the US .
They owned all their aircraft and properties .
They then were taken over by the Bill Marriott corporation who immediately leveraged all the assets turning NWA into a debt ridden company .
I refer to this takeover as done by the Mormon Mafia ..NWA had a terrible relationship with their employees and relied on the mutual aid pact to stay afloat what with all their problem with strikes .
I think I ’d welcome back the CAB !

Do n’t forget World Airways operating out of Oakland , CA .
Their hangar ( could hold 4 B - 747s ) is still there after having been leased by UAL for a few years ( 1988 - 2002 ) mostly to perform “ Section 41 ” overhauls on early 747s .
Unfortunately , most of the heavy maintenance is now outsourced to Asian countries – China .

That list might grow too large though !
Great site … enjoyed seeing former airline paint jobs on these aircraft .
bill bailey said on August 23rd , 2010 at 11:04 pm :
In my humble opinion , PA went under with deregulation .
When I hired on with EAL in ’ 63 , we only had two flag carriers ; PA and TW .
TWA had some good domestic routes that helped feed their int’l markets .
PA did not .
In 1978 , same year as deregulation , NA came up for sale .
Several airlines bid on it , including EA .
CAB ruled in favor of PA due to route conflicts NA / EA , and PA ’s argument that they needed online domestic feed .
True enough , but NA route structure was n’t up to it , and PA closed many of the smaller NA markets soon after acquisition .
They correctly understood their problem , but bought an airline that was n’t the solution .
Because of its larger domestic feed , TW outlived PA , who lasted as long as they did by selling off assets .
The fatal blow was struck in 1978 , it just took a long time to reach its inevitable conclusion .
alastair robertson said on August 24th , 2010 at 7:34 am :

Being a Brit I am not familiar with all the airlines but I do remember my first trans-atlantic flight in a Connie of Capital Airlines from Gatwick via Shannon and Gander to New York – something like 26 hours if I remember correctly .
I fell in love with the Connie and have remained in love with her sleek lines ever since .
The date was the summer of 1964 .
Lorrie Lang said on August 24th , 2010 at 9:24 am :
When you mentioned that Western was known as the Champagne Airline , what really caught everyone ’s attentions were our adds that had the “ Wally Bird ” sitting on the tail saying , “ Western Airlines , The Only Way To Fly ” ( and he , the bird , would be sipping a glass of champagne or smoking a cigar ) and of course one of our destinations would flash across the screen .
We also had fun with the “ Flub Stubs ” .
If we made a mistake and the passenger caught it , he was given a “ Flub Stub ” to redeme for a drink , etc .
Thanks , Lorrie Taylor Lang , Flight Attendant

I noted there are a lot of conflicting statements about Texas International ( TXI ) , Pan Am ( PAA ) , National ( NAL ) and Continental ( CAL ) .
This is the story as I remember it .
After a manipulated strike in the winter of 1974 into 1975 at TXI which is money losing time for most carriers .
TXI collected money from the Mutual Aid Pact ( MAP ) .
The MAP is a program established by the Carriers to pay a striking carrier sums of money while they are on strike .
TXI took this money and bought a controlling interest in NAL .
They then sold the stock to PAA at a healthy profit .
The next major move TXI made was to buy controlling interest in CAL and merge the two under the Continental banner .
I was there during that period of time and thats the way I saw it .

All American Aviation Co. became All American Airways and then Allegheny Airlines , as an airmail service from 5 - 12 - 39 to 1949 when passenger service began and did n’t change the name until 10 - 27 - 79 .
Allegheny merged with Lake Central ( 11-12-49 to 6-30 - 68 ) & Mohawk ( 4-6- 45 to 4-11 - 72 ) eventually changing it ’s name on 10 - 28 - 79 to USAir only to become US Airways in 1996 .
An additional merge was with PSA and Piedmont in 1989 , then one year later service to Europe was started .
American
West acquired this entire group in 2005 moved from Washington , DC to Tempe , Arizona keeping the established and global name recognition .
This brief history should set the record straight .
I had the privilege of flying for this fine company from 1962 to 1994 , and as a Captain for 27 years .
They even issued me a wife . . . who worked as a F / A for 18 years .
Thanks for the opportunity to share .

Does anyone recall MGM , flew 727 with 67 or 70 seats .
Based out of LAX , they served LAS , and LGA .
My wife was a res supervisor in LA

J Border - you ’ve got it a–backwards .
North Central & Southern merged to become Republic , then merged with Hughes Air West and kept the Republic name .
Then Republic was taken over by NWA who was taken over by DL .
Huges Air West came from the West Cast , Pacific , Bonanza merger .
North Central was known as Wisconsin Central which was the first airline to fly a NFL team ( Green Bay Packers ) ….. in 1941 .

I was happy to see a commenter on here by the name of Bob Hardisty , a Captain with CO .
I was with CO for 23 years …… loved every minute of it .
CO had a program in which a member of management was on board the A/C .
We were called Directors of Passenger Service .
We were problem solvers mainly .
We sold tickets , booked reservations for hotels , rent - a- cars , and future floghts .
Etc. , etc. , Best job I ’ve ever had .

I believe you forgot to list Aeromar , another organization operatiing out of corrosian corner in Miami owned by the Fine family operaing under a Dominican certificate .
Yours truly began his airline career after serving in the Air Corps during WW - 11 Korea and finally Vietnam .
Hired on by The Flying Tigers in 1955 ( C - 46 cp- pilot ) Furloughed after several months , luckily Riddle Airlines was hireing in 1956 and was accepted as CP C - 46 and was based in Canada for the Dew Line construction sites , also received C - 46 type rateing .
Furloughed again and managed to obtain FE certificate , for which Continental Airlines hired me in1958 and completed my FE training based in El Paso DCp - 7 type .
resilgned Continental and was hired by National Air Lines in 1959 based in Miami .
Joined Mackay Airlines as DC - 3 CP in 1959 , Resigned Mackay to accept a Captains slot with Dominican Airlines C - 46 DC - 3 position in 1960 .
Recalled by Riddle in 1960 and continued on with Riddle qualifying in the DC - 7 , L - 100 , DC - 8 , 727 remaining there by my own choice till financial problems caused Riddle ( Now Airl ; ift ) to close its doors in 1980 .
Hired on with Aeromar Airlines in 1983 ( DC - 8 ) flew till my 60th birthday then resigned ti acceot a Position with Aaudia Air flying DC - 8 for the pilgrimage .
I made many mistakes in opting to remain in one spot all due to the ever increasing family I started late in life .
Phil Dean said on August 24th , 2010 at 10:11 pm :
Since you reference various female firsts in the airline industry throughout , I thought youu might like to add to the list with North Central Airlines .
Sometime in early 1979 when I was a new - hire at American , based in Chicago .
an article appeared in an Ohare employee newspaper , ( possibly one of the Chicago newspapers ) , about a flight on North Central Airlines crewed by an all female crew .
The article included a photo of the captain and the first officer , both female , seated in the cockpit .
You may wish to research .

Jared
Howe is really messed up .
Frank Lorenzo did the same thing to CO .
This guy was a real crook !!!!
CO did not get a thing out of the EA deal .
I had a lot of friends at both airlines , and they were comrads all fighting Frank .
The CO people all ready went through Franls BS , and tried to help EA people as much as they could .
Frank sold everything of value at CO before EA entered the scene .
The Flight Kitchens , the computer system , the flight planning system , etc .
He set up dummy corporations to buy these items , then charged CO a fee to use the services .
He charged CO more for a flight plan than he charged WAL .
And , it was CO ’s to start with .
C’mon , Jared , check the facts before you type …… better yet , check with some of your former co-workers at EA .
CO was put into Chapter 11 by Lorenzo , and they had $ 80 mil in the bank .
He took $ 30 mil from the CO retirement fund .
I know .
I was the PHX rep for CO ’s Agent Advisory Council .

I started with Lake Central Airlines in Lima , Ohio in 1965 and retired with US Airways in Charlotte , NC in 2001 .

Pacific Northwest ( PNA ) is not mentionned .
They merged into Western Airlines .
Ross Aimer said on August 25th , 2010 at 4:21 am :
May I add a few airlines worth mentioning .
( I flew for them and a dozen others ! )
Maverick International “ World ’s Greatest Bull Shipper ” flew 707 Freighters from Stewart Field , NY KSWF to various destinations around the world .
( 1978/79 . )
Aero America also flew 707 ’s from SEA and BFI to HNL and GEG in 79/80 .
( The crooked owner Joel Rosenberg was known to re-surface every few years and sell a bunch of tickets then declare Chapter 11 ! )
Hawaii Express “ The Big Pineapple ” stared 747 operation from LAX to HNL in 1982 .
Later switched to DC - 10s .
A great airline that became the target of a hostile takeover by a couple of attorneys who ultimately took it into bankruptcy .
Another one I ’d like to forget was Rosenbaum Aviation who flew DC - 8- 63/73s for Emery and ABX Air Freight .
I flew a few months for them while mostly half asleep !

Sam Parks said on August 25th , 2010 at 9:52 am :
Great history lesson .
Read all the comments .
You can “ feel ” the history bleeding from the screen .
Working for an airline was a “ passion ” for many .
Airline industry resembles giant swiriling pool or hurricane full of wonderful people .
Imagine how many hundreds of thousands of hours were spent stareing out the windshield for the pilots .
How many “ miles ” were walked up and down a 24 ″ isle for F / A’s !
What stories can be told !!
I saw Morris Air mentioned only once .
Started as Morris Air Charter with PDX , SEA , SLC pilot bases crewed by Ryan Air Pilots and more I can’t remember .
Became Morris
Air , certificated in only 90 days thanks in part to an “ old man ” named Usto Schultz !
Unprecidented in airline ‘ start ups ’!
( at least that ’s what we were told ! )
Operated 3 years .
(+/-)
Absolute most fun you could have with your clothes on !
Bought by Southwest Airlines Company merger date 1/1/94 .
Many F/ A’s ( sadly ) not picked up .
Pilots were “ stapled ” to bottom of seniority list as opposed to “ alternative ” of “ do n’t let the door hit you in the butt on the way out ! ”
Several did n’t !
Acquisition ( IMO ) was a good business decision over long run .
Over the years many “ potential ” good acquisitions were killed when it came to senority list mergers .
Many lives affected .
One last .
“ Maverick Airways ” operated in ’ 73 - ’75 from SAT to EGP ( Eagle Pass , Texas ) Part 135 “ scheduled service ” owned by a local banker .
Two flights a day operating ( wait for it !! ) a single engine Cherokee 6 .
Five passenger w/ minimum baggage .
Hour and ten minute flight .
No approach at EGP .
Fortunately AM radio station was near runway !
( uhh no of course not …we would never fly a “ made up approach ” ! )
Operated about two years .
Freight dried up and so did company .
Just another “ stick ” on the funeral pyre of aviation history !
John said on August 25th , 2010 at 10:07 am :
Eastern Air Lines , , , what a great company .
Lots of folks are quick to blame Lorenzo about the demise of the company .
Had Labor / Management
or Management / Labor resolved their issues in the first place it never would have reached Lorenzo ’s desk .
Let ’s see , how many years did both groups bang heads about work rules / cost issues … Worked for 20yrs with EAL … many fond memories of the company and 99 % of the dedicated employees .
The other 1 % knows who they are and what they did to this company .
kirk .c. said on August 25th , 2010 at 12:26 pm :
HAS ANYONE THOUGHT OF NAMING ALL THE ” BAD PRESIDENTS AND CEO’S THAT RAN THE AIRLINES INTO THE GROUND ?
MOST OF WHICH WERE NOT EVEN AIRLINE PEOPLE .
Steve said on August 25th , 2010 at 12:27 pm :
In the 1960 or so , Purdue University had an airline called PAC .
I think it was Purdue Aeronautical Corp .
Paul Carroll said on August 25th , 2010 at 1:41 pm :
Does it count if the airline never got off the ground ?
Family Airlines , HQ in Las Vegas , had possession of several 747 ’s ready to fly MIA , JFK , LAX in 1992 .
One was even painted , but the developer turned out to be a crook .
Joe Williams said on August 25th , 2010 at 1:57 pm :
I worked for 4 airlines ; started with Braniff in 1977 & then went to work for Muse Air in 1981 which sold out to WN that changed the name to TranStar & then went to work for NWA in 1988 and left there in 2003 .

I had forgotten about many of these airlines .

what happened to modernair ?
It was I believe based in miami and had a separate internal route system in west germany .
they operated convair 880s and 990s on the german routes some of the female flight attendaants were topless ps Iblieve the 880s were then the fastess civil jet aircraft in service

What happened to Northwest Orient ?
( rebranded Northwest Airlines )
Sig Gustafsson said on August 25th , 2010 at 8:04 pm :
A nice site to remind us of the good old days , and the event travel used to be .
They said it would get better but who can forget the silver service of Pan Am and Braniff International .
Did n’t happen .
It might be interesting to put the list in the a chronological order or when that the airline went out of operation so we can remember this sequense of mostly sad events .
Just an idea .
Jim Pitts said on August 25th , 2010 at 8:51 pm :
Outstanding !!
I joined QANTAS in ’59 in HNL , the Continental ( LAX & HNL ) then USAir in BOS .
Fond memories after 37 yrs .
Catalina Airlines flew from Long Beach Airport to Avalon Bay with sea planes ( landed in the Harbor ) and was owned by the same guy the operated the SS Catalina Steam Ship from San Pedro to Catalina in the summer .
When flying with the Air Force during the Korean Conflict we used to crew rest on Wake Island enroute to TYO and stayed in TALOA ( Trans Ocean Airlines ) quarters with the crews from Tiger , Seaboard Western , ONA ( Overseas National ) Pacific and others .
Had great times there .
One airline you left out was South Pacific that flew from HNL to PPT ( Tahiti ) in the late 50 ″s and early 60 ’s with Lockheed 749 A/C .
One correction , PSA started out with DC 3 ’s and DC 4’s .
It was Air California , HQD in Newport Beach that started out with the 1011 ’s that they bought from QANTAS .
I have rambled on but love this site .
Thanks Jim

Flew in and out of Ft Polk LA a number of times on Trans Texas Air – somewhat affectionatly known as Tree Top Air – they claimed to have the best safety record with never a crash
Dan Kelley , Jr. said on August 25th , 2010 at 10:45 pm :
I never saw the original information , but I was a member of the 9th class of pilots hired by People Express Airlines in Septemberof 1981 .
We were all based at EWR .
We had 10 B - 737-100 and 200 series a / c , 101 pilots , and 300 f/a ’s when I was hitred .
I checked out in the 737 and the 727 .
Only a family illness prevented my adding the 747 to my ticket , also .
It was a fun place to work and to begin an airline career .
When I left in 1987 ( after the arrival of Lorenzo and his scab contingent ) , I was # 101 out of about 1400 pilots on the seniority list .
Also , we had grown to about 70 a / c sporting the PEX logo .
Jim Tang said on August 26th , 2010 at 5:59 am :
If you ’re researching California commuters , there ’s Swift Aire Lines out of San Luis Obispo ( SBP ) – 1969 - 1981 .
Started with Piper Navajos , upgraded to DeHavilland Herons , then Aerospatiale ND262 Nords , and closed down while flying the Nords and Fokker F - 27s .
There ’s even a book called “ Swift Aire Lines ” published in 1979 and still available on the used market .
Also Apollo Airways / Pacific Coast Airlines out of Santa Barbara ( SBA ) .
I think the years were 1975 - 1985 , flying Handley Page Jetstreams with dinky little French Turbomeca Astazou turboprop engines that resembled pencils while producing a decent amount of ESHP .
Golden
West was mentioned by others .
You might also mention Justin Collin ’s failed attempt at Golden Gate Airlines out of Monterey ( I think the identifier is MRY ) .
Started with Metro IIs as Gem State Airlines in Idaho , bought the DHC - 7 Air Pacific operation in Oakland and moved to MRY to start his California adventure .
I believe it went from 1979 to 1981 , and during that time he managed to buy and then take Swift Aire down with him .
On the other hand , cataloging the hundreds of failed commuter airlines could tax even the capabilities of the internet .
Jim Pitts said on August 26th , 2010 at 7:10 am :
Correction , I screwed up .
Air California original flew Lockheed Electras aquired from QANTAS .. not L 1011 ’s .
Sorry , I ’m getting older and , by the way , the DPS program at Continental Airlines was a great program .
Many of the DPS ’s went on to be Sales Reps . ( The Proud Bird With The Golden Tail )

It was one of the most historic airline ever
Art said on August 26th , 2010 at 12:39 pm :
Another Airline Gone !
I was VP Marketing , Public Relation for MGM Grand Air LAX - JFK - LAX start up .
( Kirk Kerkorian )
We purchased 3 727-100’s and outfitted the aircraft with 33 seats , very posh .
A fare structure the same as First Class fares on the major carriers .
From my background in the airline business CO 23 yrs , SW 2 years , Muse 3 years , A contact of mine from PAA sold us the JFK slot and we were in business .
These were days when networking helped .
We received some of the business from other contacts I had with reservations managers from the all the major Airlines , AA , UA , TWA , DL .
We got there overflow of First Class passengers .
Along with our regular bookings and with only 33 seats per flight to fill , two flights a day we of course had the highest load factor for any start up Airline from day one .
After one year a new president was brought in .
He had expansion plans that would take the airline down and he eventually did !
This was his second airline failure .
I resigned shortly after he arrived since I was not in agreement with his plans .
so “ another one bites the dust ” .

USAfrica Airways
US Africa Airways was a United States based airline that operated flights between Washington Dulles International Airport ( then called Dulles International Airport ) and Johannesburg in starting in June , 1994 .
[1 ]
Flights refueled in the Cape Verde Islands .
Later , once a week flights were added to Cape Town , which also refueled in the Cape Verde Islands .
The airline was the first U.S. airline flying only international routes since the U.S. airline industry was deregulated in 1978 .
The airline operated flights from June 1994 to February 3 , 1995 . [ 2 ]
It leased two McDonnell Douglas MD - 11 aircraft from American Airlines , registered as N1757A and N1757B .

Not certain if it was considered a U.S. carrier .

AirCal did not cease operations , it was purchased whole by AAL , and as a matter of fact , was asked to stop hiring pilots just a few months before the official take - over by AAL .
At the merge AirCal was doing very well , and AAL took pilots , aircraft , routes , employees , and management into the AAL family .

God , I love this site .
Two questions .
First , when Lorenzo took down Continental the story was that two employees dressed up like ninjas and armed were arrested outside of Lorenzo ’s home planning to kill him .
Is that true ?
Next , what about Air America ?
The overt / covert CIA airline ?
Ken said on August 27th , 2010 at 8:54 am :
I worked for EAL for 20 years ( 1969 - 1989 ) and wholeheartedly agree with John .
While Frank Lorenzo certainlt did not help EAL , he was a symptom , not the root cause of Eastern ’s demise .
Starting with Eddie Rickenbackers misinformed decision not to invest in jets , which lead to a VERY expensive purchase or jet delivery positions , EAL was asddled with a huge amount on long term debt and an extremely contentious relationship with its unions .
EAL was filled with skilled professionals and I miss the company , but given current conditions , do n’t miss working at an airline – it is not the same business in which I started in 1969 .
Great site – love the history and all the comments .

I myself worked in the airline business for a period of 33 years .
First for British United Airways at Gatwick Airport , London .
Then on to Pan American World Airways at Heathrow , London .
After that , with Iran Air , London , then Finnair , London , and finally with Saudi Arabian Airlines in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia .
What a terrific field of work we had !!!
Loved it !!
Nothing better .
My regards to all my ex colleagues .
Karen said on August 27th , 2010 at 12:06 pm :
I think it would be nice if Chalk Airways was included .
To my understanding it was one of the oldest airlines and it operated seaplanes from Biscayne Bay in Miami to the Florida Keys .
I rode on it from Key West to Miami and it was a blast !
george flavell said on August 27th , 2010 at 12:52 pm :
A couple that I did not see , United States Overseas Airlines ( USOA ) and Artic Pacific ; also I beleive PSA started with the DC - 4 aircraft before they ever had Electras .
It is a pleasure to connect with site and refresh the names and times ; some might be interested in a book that has been published and follows a pilot from first flight to retirement that has good reviews from pilots .

I am that pilot .

This certainly brings back so many memories from my travels over the years .
My family and I have taken quite a few of these defunct air lines on our many travels .
I remember Tower Air Lines especially because that air line carried many military and Government personal as well as me to and from Vietnam during that conflict back in the 60s and 70s .

A mother has branded her daughter 's school " mad " after she was disciplined for going to school without a blazer on the hottest day of the year .
Fifteen - year - old Aimee Dickson , of Armthorpe , Doncaster , was told to go home and collect her blazer by her headmaster at Armthorpe Comprehensive .
Mum Dawn Dickson said her daughter rang shortly after school began to say she was being sent home to get her blazer .
Mrs Dickson said her husband had to take his daughter 's blazer into school .
He spoke to the headmaster who said it was school policy for pupils to carry their blazers at all times .
' Common sense ' Mrs Dickson said : " He said if they feel it gets too hot they can ask permission to take their blazers off , but they must carry or wear them at all times .
" In this weather it 's a bit mad . "
School governor Margaret Pinkney said : " It just seems petty to me .
We should be using a little common sense because with this heat it 's a different ball game .
Teachers should be able to bend the rules a little .
" If the weather is like this year after year the school is going to have to have a summer uniform . "
