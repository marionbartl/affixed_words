WASHINGTON  A federal judge held a former USA TODAY reporter in contempt of court on Tuesday for failing to identify sources who named former Army scientist Steven Hatfill as a possible suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks that killed five people .
U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he would begin fining Toni Locy $ 500 per day , escalating to $ 5,000 per day , until she identifies the sources .
Hatfill 's lawyers asked that Locy — and not her former employer or others — be required to pay the fines .
The judge said he would consider postponing the penalty , however , to allow Locy and her lawyers to appeal the contempt ruling .
Walton did n't immediately decide whether Locy would be personally responsible for payment of the fines , if imposed .
At the same time , Walton delayed a decision on whether to hold former CBS reporter James Stewart in contempt for not disclosing sources for his reporting on the matter .
Hatfill , who was publicly identified in 2002 by then - attorney general John Ashcroft as a " person of interest " in the attacks , has never been charged .
His lawyers have argued that news reports linking him to the federal investigation irreparably damaged his reputation .
" I do n't like to hold anyone in contempt , " Walton said .
" I fully appreciate the importance of a free press .
On the other hand , the media has to be responsible . "
Hatfill was not present at Tuesday 's hearing .
His attorney , Patrick O'Donnell , declined to comment after the session .
Lucy Dalglish , executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , described the judge 's order as a " drastic action . "
" Of all the federal court sanctions on reporters for refusing to reveal confidential sources over the past several years , this is perhaps the most disturbing , " Dalglish said .
" Toni Locy is being punished for doing what reporters are supposed to do : making sure important information gets to the public about whether the government had the investigation into a major public health threat under control , " she said .
Dalglish also urged Congress to take up proposed legislation that would shield reporters from being forced to identify confidential sources .
" Toni Locy faces possible financial ruin for doing her job and doing it well , " Dalglish said .
Locy is one of five reporters Hatfill has subpoenaed to disclose government sources who identified him as a possible suspect .
Now a journalism professor at West Virginia University , Locy has argued that she spoke to a number of officials regarding the anthrax inquiry , but she cannot remember which sources provided information linking Hatfill to the government 's inquiry during her reporting for USA TODAY .

For Immediate Release
April 8 , 2015 **** Who Took Johnny - Feature Doc about Johnny Gosch ’s disappearance to have its theatrical premiere in Des Moines on April 24th .
Noreen Gosch , Johnny ’s mother will be in attendance to do Q and A .
An amazing , lunatic documentary that will leave you creeped - out , excited and surprised , ”
- John Waters , director of Hairspray and Crybaby
Who Took Johnny , a documentary film about Noreen Gosch and her 30 year fight for justice for her son Johnny , will have its theatrical premiere in Des Moines , IA at the Fleur Cinema ( www.fleurcinema.com ) followed by screenings at Film Scene in Iowa City ( http://www.icfilmscene.org/).
Utilizing strong local reporting from the time as well as current interviews , filmmakers weave together past events into a coherent narrative and try to explain the case that was never solved .
Noreen Gosch ’s passionate advocacy for her son led to the passage of laws regarding missing children and profoundly affected the culture of the entire country .
Who Took Johnny has been on the International festival circuit for past year where it has gotten rave reviews and several jury and audience awards .
Like the documentary films of Errol Morris whose subjects ’ words seem to crack under scrutiny , Who Took Johnny is a character study that steadily builds the narrow worlds of those circling around the lost boy , Gosch often the figure setting into motion the orbits of others .
The shaping of the characters is aided by the highly publicized nature of the case as talk show footage and TV appearances act as a disembodied account of how the story played out publicly .
The public facts are then contrasted with highly personal interviews with the subjects today , a hindsight explanation of actions that humanizes the media presentation and whose clashing accounts leave the audience with an apprehension that is then exploited in the editing .
- Donna K - Hammer to Nail
Beautifully told by a trio of filmmakers giving as much respect to this story as one could ever possibly hope , this is easily one of the best true crime documentaries to hit
screens in quite some time .
At all costs , hunt this film down .

On September 5 , 1982 , Johnny Gosch , 12 , disappeared while delivering newspapers in West Des Moines , Iowa .
For the next 30 years his mother Noreen devoted her life to finding out what happened .
WHO TOOK JOHNNY is an examination into the infamous thirty - year - old cold case of Iowa paperboy Johnny Gosch , the first missing child to appear on a milk carton .
The film focuses on Johnny 's mother , Noreen Gosch , and her relentless quest to find the truth about what happened to her son .
Along the way there have been mysterious sightings , bizarre revelations , and a confrontation with a man who claims to have helped abduct Johnny .
WHO TOOK JOHNNY captures the endless intrigue surrounding the most spellbinding missing person 's case in U.S. history .
If you ’ve ever gotten separated from your child for just a few moments and remember the profound panic that sets in , you can begin to understand what Noreen Gosch has felt over the last 30 years since her son Johnny disappeared delivering newspapers in West Des Moines , Iowa on the morning of September 5 , 1982 .
More than any other missing child case , Johnny ’s story has spawned countless theories and has instilled intrigue in the millions who remember the kid on the side of a milk carton .
Mixing original interviews with archival news footage , home video and film material spanning 30 years , WHO TOOK JOHNNY chronicles the 30 - year history of the case through the eyes of the key players .
We hear from family , friends , law enforcement , journalists , as well as parents of current missing children .
From purported attempts by Johnny to contact his family , to clashes with Police , the story takes a bizarre twist when a convicted child molester comes forward to admit abducting Johnny .
Police do n’t believe his story , while Noreen is convinced he ’s telling the truth .
Then , 17 years after he disappeared , Noreen confesses that Johnny visited her briefly one night , though too scared of his captors to stay .
Police are dumbfounded , unable to corroborate her story .
WHO TOOK JOHNNY connects the dots between the unanswered questions surrounding Johnny Gosch 's disappearance .
Through eyewitness accounts and compelling evidence that span three decades , the film patiently builds a case that law enforcement was never able to close .
FILMMAKER STATEMENT
How did you get involved ?
Ten years ago , while at an industry screening for our film Horns and Halos at HBO headquarters in New York , we were approached by writer Nick Bryant with an intriguing pitch .
He told us he had a once - in - a - lifetime story to tell .
He had spent years investigating a child prostitution network that was conveniently covered up a decade earlier .
In researching the scandalous allegations of the Franklin Federal Credit Union , he came upon the connection to a bizarre story of the first missing kid on a milk carton - Johnny Gosch .
After learning more about Johnny 's case , we became intrigued , and cautiously began to pursue a film about it .
How long have you been working on it ?
We were first introduced to the story in 2003 .
It 's taken over 10 years of shooting and thousands of miles traveled to capture dozens of interviews , edit hundreds of hours of footage , and sift through tens of thousands of documents and photographs to make Who Took Johnny .
Why is this film important ?
There are currently almost 90,000 unsolved missing person cases in the department of justice database , and it's clear that even with all of the advancements in technology and public awareness , the problem of missing and exploited children has only gotten worse since Johnny disappeared over 30 years ago .
Understandably with such an ugly issue , people would rather skip - over reading about these stories or change the channel of a news report , pretending the problem does n't exist , rather than confront the brutality of the exploitation and trafficking of children in our country .
What Happened to Johnny Gosch ?

CEASE AND DESIST NOTICE
TO
SHEILA MARIE GUERRA
ALBERT LEA , MINN .
April 9 , 2014
EMAIL ADDRESS : wed6ntm@gmail.com
I am posting this Cease and Desist Notice to one Sheila Marie Guerra of Albert Lea , Minn .
She has harassed and slandered me for years .
She has repeatedly interfered with the investigation of the Johnny Gosch case .
Many attempts to reason with her have failed .
She is deranged and dangerous making numerous threats against me .
A few years ago , she contacted a Medical Examiner in Colorado , suggesting a body they had in their morgue was my son Johnny .
Despite the fact that the dental records and DNA did not match , she continued her dialogue with the Medical Examiner until my investigators had to be involved to end the issue .
The body was not Johnny Gosch .
Another time , she announced publicly that she knew Johnny Gosch and in fact had sex with him on occasion .
I do not believe for a moment she had ever met Johnny .
Yet another attempt to gain her " 15 minutes of fame by attaching herself to a famous case " .
There have been vile emails from her using language , which I would not ever use in my life .
Her actions depict diminished capacity and personality disorders , the inability to determine right from wrong and her lack of vocabulary , as she resorts to such vile language .
She quieted down for a couple years but now is back full force , this time with some stupid blog in which she writes all of the slanderous statements about me and other people .
Even accusing me of war crimes in Nazi Germany ....
I was not even born yet during the time frame she is referring to ... again deranged behavior .
It has reached a point of threats being sent to me .
Her behavior has escalated dramatically .
I have requested over and over for her to remove my name from her blogs , and cease contacting me .
However , she continues .
I told her if she did not stop I would have no choice but to do a public notice via my website of a cease and desist statement .
I have reported all of this to the police including the slanderous material ..... yet she continues .
I have also advised the police of the possibility of violent behavior towards me by her .
When I told her I would do the public notice , she then threatened me again saying she would make my name / address public .
That has no affect upon me because my name and address / email address is already public .
This is not the first time , I have had someone harass me and it wo n't be the last time .
However , I am tired of dealing with this person , it has gone on far too long and as I mentioned before her actions have escalated .
I have notified the police that if anything should happen to me , they are to knock on her door FIRST .
SHEILA MARIE GUERRA ... ALBERT LEA , MINN .....
CEASE AND DESIST ALL SLANDEROUS STATEMENTS AND CONTACT WITH NOREEN GOSCH IMMEDIATELY PENDING LEGAL ACTION .
WHO TOOK JOHNNY - THE FILM
January 8 , 2013 Who Took Johnny : The Film
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rumur/who-took-johnny
This past summer filmmakers from the production company , RUMUR , came to shoot a one hour special on Johnny for MSNBC .
As you know , there has been a lot of media about this case and I have dealt with countless producers .
This is the first time in my experience that what filmmakers told me they were going to do actually happened .
The piece aired on MSNBC in December called " Missing Johnny " .
At the time they made it clear to me that they wanted to make a full length film , and would do so once the TV special was made .
I know that there is a lot of important material that had to left out of the TV version due to limited time that will hopefully end up in this longer version .
Now they are raising money via the website Kickstarter to pay for all the legal and post production costs associated with finishing the full - length , uncensored film .
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rumur/who-took-johnny
Anyone can make a pledge for a particular reward ( be it DVD or Producer credit ) , and if the project raises its goal money within the allotted time then they keep the money and the backers get their rewards .
If they do n't raise all the money , then the project gets nothing and the backers all get their money back .
They want to pre sell 500 DVDs ( or 1000 downloads ) in the next 10 days to get enough money ( otherwise they wo n't get anything ) .
If enough people who care about the issue of missing and exploited children and human trafficking want to support the film then they will surely meet their goal , and it will guarantee that the longer version will be made available to anyone .

IOWA PREVENTING ABUSE CONFERENCE OCTOBER 19th , 2012 ( Click Picture for PDF )
September 12th , 2012
30th ANNIVERSARY
September 5 , 2012 Dear Johnny ,
It has been 30 long years since your were ripped away from your family and everything you knew in life to be good .
On the day you were kidnapped , it was so difficult to believe such a thing could happen in a quiet neighborhood .
Nothing like this had happened in our community before .
I could only imagine what was happening to you , the terror , fear and pain you endured .
In the first days , thousands of people volunteered to help us search for you .
Each time a search party would come back and had found nothing , I breathed a sigh of relief because perhaps it was a sign you were still alive .
My prayers for you were that you would be found safe but until that time God would be watching over you .
Each night I prayed that some new idea would come to me to try that would bring you back home .
Every morning there was something new to try , someone to reach who might help but in my heart I knew each minute , hour of every day was time out of your life .
Within a short time TV shows wanted to hear your story , as the shows would air , new leads were coming in to be worked .
We hired a private investigator to work full time , it was at that point we began to get real answers .
What we learned , no parent would want to know but we had to face the truth of why children are kidnapped .
At that time , I not only missed you but the pain of now " knowing " what was happening was a walking nightmare .
What you have suffered , no child should ever have to go through .
At times , I would remember you as a little boy and some of the things you said and did .
One time , you told me at 5 yrs .
old that you wanted a " blue castle cake for your birthday " .
I had no idea where you had seen that type of cake .
But eventually , I found it in a cookbook the exact cake you described .
Building the cake was a family project , you were so happy when it was finished that you did n't want to eat it .
You told me you just wanted keep it forever .....
Every parent wants the best for their children and it breaks my heart to know that your innocence and childhood were robbed from you ...
I wish you could be as happy as you were in this photo .
A short time after you were kidnapped , a neighbor lady called me and said " I would like to tell you what a fine boy you raised .
Johnny helped my six year old son .
One night after school some bullies were beating up my son and smashed his lunchbox , Johnny ran to help , he jumped in tossing each of the bullies onto the ground , telling them to get lost ... they ran like the wind .
Johnny then walked my little boy home .
I just thought you should know what a kind boy you raised .
" Johnny , you came back home and never mentioned the " good deed " you had done that day by helping the other little boy .
It was very touching to hear , somehow it made me feel as though you were not so far away .
As years passed , we received valuable information that you were possibly still alive .
Other victims contacted us , we had more pieces to place in this giant puzzle .
Then came a real break , information that you were definitely still alive and had escaped reached us .
You are grown now and do not look like the little boy who was kidnapped , so you can " hide in plain sight " and live .
Even though that means it is n't possible for a normal family life , you are safe .
That information surfaced a number of years ago , my hope is that you are still alive today .
It has been a very long 30 years and no one knows that better than you .
I am proud of you , Johnny and hope you are able to see this message .
I love you , Mom ( Noreen Gosch )
STATE OF IOWA STATEMENT ON TV REGARDING A COLD CASE TASK FORCE
October 15 , 2011
This week it was announced through the media that the State of Iowa was discontinuing the " Cold Case Task Force " in Polk County .
During the news report on NBC , they sited Johnny Gosch 's kidnapping as well as a few other cases .
It was reported they did not have the money for the Task Force to continue to investigate these cases ..
Well it is news to me and the Johnny Gosch Foundation that there was a Cold Case Task Force in Polk County .
No one had ever contacted me or the Johnny Gosch Foundation regarding the case or any involvement of the Task Force .
I would suspect no one ever talked to the Martins or the Allen 's concerning their kidnapped boys either .
The West Des Moines Police and FBI have done precious little since the case began but absolutely nothing in the past 14 years .
It would have been more professional if they had at least sent some type of notice to the families of the victims .
Instead of them learning of this Task Force being shut down on a TV News Program .
Could this just be another way of closing these kidnap cases forever so that it would seem as though " it never happened here " ??????
That would be my guess , since the WDMPD have hounded me for my DNA for the past two years and I declined to give it to them .
We know they would have used the DNA to claim some body in a morgue somewhere in the country , saying it was Johnny and closing the case .
I was advised by my attorney to decline to give my DNA to anyone .
Earlier in the year when a corpse was suspected to be Johnny in Colorado , the medical examiner called me and said the WDMPD had sent Johnny 's dental records .
She also told that the " WDMPD were pressuring her to say it was Johnny 's body " .
The examiner then stated that in the dental records there was a " tooth restoration " ( filling ) in a certain tooth .
I replied " your corpse is not Johnny , he had a tooth restoration but in a different tooth " .
There was dead silence on the phone and the medical examiner finally said " oh so you have seen the dental records then " ???
I replied " oh yes I have a set of them and know for certain your corpse is not Johnny .
So you should be asking yourself why would the WDMPD try to pressure you to say it is Johnny when they know full well it is not " ?
Following that phone call , Jim Rothstein , retired New York Police Detective contacted the medical examiner and explained what has been going on in the Des Moines area concerning the cover up on the three kidnap cases .
This is just a portion of the latest activity on this 29 year old case .

Massive Arrests Made in Internet Pedophile Ring
Nearly 1,000,000 children reported missing every year ... in America Hundreds of thousands of children enslaved into prostitution .... in America
The following report only addresses the latest exposure and arrests .
Hundreds of children set free .
Dear Friends , Recently ( last day or two ) I wrote a release about the evil nature of pornography and how it degenerates leading to the potential and real sexual exploitation of children , and women .
Amazing Timing : I just received a news story about the recent breakup and arrests of an international pedophile ring .
This appears to present a good example of the information I presented in my last release entitled " The Evil Dynamic to Pornography " leading to active deviance .
including some 70,000 members , tens of thousands of images and films of children being abused .
Over 230 children were rescued .
Arrest and Rescue : " ... Europol said in a statement that " Operation Rescue " had identified 670 suspects and that 230 abused children in 30 countries had been taken to safety . "
MSNBC.COM
How many more are there ?
How vast is this demonically inspired / influenced perversion of possession , addiction and abuse ?
Where are they getting the children ?
Many of those arrested come from prominent / professional positions in their community .
Moral depravity defies demographic description .
Vast amounts of images and films were taken as evidence .
When you read the article of how the site operated you can see the progression of degeneration .
The article link is below .
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42108748/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/
Noreen Gosch and the Discovery : Years ago one of our regular Preventing AbuseConference speakers , Noreen Gosch , mother of kidnapping victim Johnny Gosch discovered her son was abducted by a national pedophile ring ( 30 years ago ) .
A few years back she uncovered a massive Internet pornography network resulting in hundreds of arrests .
Below is a statement from her : " Human trafficking is fanned by the flames of " pornography " .
The internet has made it easy for these perverted individuals to view [ pornography ] .... all types and soon that is n't enough to achieve their thrills , they must move on to something else which is often violating a child .
Addiction to [ pornography ] is the breeding ground for " human trafficking , murder and torture of young innocent victims . "
Noreen Gosch , 3 - 17 - 11 Do You Remember ?
Remember the discovery of government officials from the SEC and Pentagon accessing pornography ?
This presented national security concerns .
Could this recent Internet pedophile ring lead to national security threats ?
How Many More Are
There :
Here 's my question :
How many more sites are operating ?
How many more women and children are victimized ?
Nearly 1,000,000 children reported missing every year .
Child pornography is the fastest growing on the Internet .
Where are they getting the children ?
Hundreds of thousands of children trapped into prostitution ... in America .
The Spiritual Dynamic to Sexual Exploitation :
When a person is sexually exploited they experience the ongoing tearing and destroying of the mind , body and soul .
To deal with the torment , many victims fall into mental compartmentalization i.e. multipersonality disorders schizophrenia ) .
The Evil of Perpetrators : Perpetrators of child and women sexual exploitation are not necessarily just afflicted with a messed up gene .
These people are diabolically evil .
Consider this : To victimize a woman or child that person(s ) have to formulate the evil plan to capture the victim , over the cries and continual cry of torment they continue the victimization ( some 30 times a day !!!) and yet some are murdered .
Jesus said the evil one seeks to take life .
Yet , Jesus came to give life .
John 10:10 What We Can Do :
We need to put pressure on the Justice Department to prosecute obscenity crimes , impact our culture to return to moral values that help protect children .
Support movies and media programming promoting sound moral values and elect government officials who support those timeless values .

NANCY DIS - GRACE SHOW
March 3 , 2011
The Johnny Gosch Story I must admit it has been a long time since I have seen such a " dog and pony show " as that which I witnessed last night on the Nancy Grace program .
I know that when they called Jim Rothstein , retired New York City Police Detective ( who has been working on Johnny 's case for over 12 years ) to be on the show , they said " do you think Noreen would still come on the show if we called her " .
Jim said " no , she would n't " .
I declined to do this show based on previous shows I had viewed by Nancy Grace , she is a very caustic , angry and bitter woman who attacks most all of her guests for no apparent reason .
I have worked too hard for nearly 30 years to jeopardize this case by doing a TV show such as Nancy Grace .
In their attempt to tell Johnny Gosch 's story they failed in so many areas and left the viewing audience with half truths or is that half lies .
I find impossible to believe that the West Des Moines Police would have given the " entire case file on Johnny 's case " to CNN to read .
Yet the show host stated " the police did a lot on this case because I have read the entire file " .
The West Des Moines Police would have only sent " what they wanted the show to see " .
As they talked about Paul Bonacci , discrediting him , they failed to mention that in court in February 1999 , Federal Judge Urbom asked Bonacci to tell all the details of the Johnny Gosch kidnapping .
Bonacci did so .... at the end of the proceedings , Judge Urbom ruled that " PAUL BONACCI WAS TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE JOHNNY GOSCH KIDNAPPING " .
Yet as the show continued the host stated " Police have never been able to confirm that Bonacci was involved in Johnny 's kidnapping " .
THE WEST DES MOINES POLICE DID NOT EVER QUESTION PAUL BONACCI ABOUT THE JOHNNY GOSCH KIDNAPPING , SO HOW COULD THEY PROVE OR DISPROVE ANYTHING .
They failed to report that Bonacci had not been questioned .
About
The phone calls which came to our home , again the show host failed to tell the audience that there was another person at my home and took the calls with me ( we had two phones ) .
They also knew Johnny and his voice .
Yet the show host delighted in saying that I " imagined it " .
Good lord I have seen better drama at a high school play .
The show was aimed at one goal to attack and try to discredit me .
Jim Rothstein did an amazing job of voicing the facts on the case when they allowed him enough air time to do so .
It is very clear that the staff on the show as well as Nancy Grace herself are not well versed in this type of kidnapping .
Nor did they take into account that there are two other unsolved kidnappings in Des Moines .... Eugene Martin and Marc Allen .
Now for your panel of so called experts .
What a joke .
Who was that bird that stated " there are so many runaway's that there is no need to kidnap kids " or words to that effect ????
If that were true then why are there so many kidnapped children and why would there be a need for Nancy Grace to be doing shows on this subject ?
Seems like an " oxy moron " to me ....
Heavy on the MORON .
The psychologist appeared to be " in the bag " on the show .
Interesting that she seems capable of diagnosing a person whom she has never met .
I laughed out loud when I heard her say that " Noreen had suffered depression and wanted to believe all these things happened " .
I have never suffered from any condition at all .
I could see from the beginning how this case was being handled so someone had to do something and it was me .
I started the private investigation by hiring a P.I. within a few short weeks after the kidnapping and the rest is history .
When I told the police chief I was going to hire a P.I. , he began yelling and screaming telling me I was not allowed to hire anyone .
The police chief had a great deal to hide .
When the private detectives started on the job the first day .
The WDMPD arrested them in an act of protest .
Unbelievable are the things this police chief did to try and stop my private investigation .
However , none of that saw air time last night did it ?
The former police chief was relieved of his duties several months after Johnny 's kidnapping .
He had a history of being drunk on the job and prior to Johnny 's kidnapping , 21 of his own staff filed a protest against him .
So this was not a smooth operating police department at the time of Johnny 's kidnapping .
During the period of time before the Franklin Scandal was exposed , there were parties involving minors , attended by that police chief .
No wonder he was trying to stop Johnny 's investigation .
Shortly after he left office , he was arrested at Target for shop lifting a number of items .
There were big headlines in the newspaper here following that arrest .
As Jim Rothstein stated on the show " he based his statements on experience " .
However , each time Jim stated the facts that actually happened , they quickly changed to the next subject of attack against me .
I doubt that any of the so called panel of experts ever worked on a kidnapping case , except for Mark Klaas , who 's daughter was kidnapped and murdered .
I wonder if Mark Klaas was the guest on the show if he would have been treated in the same accusatory manner .
Johnny 's case is very different than most other cases .

IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM NOREEN GOSH
May 21 , 2010
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN :
It has come to my attention that there is an effort underway to " expose " my son , Johnny and force him out of his present location .
I am NOT involved in this and do not approve .
I think it is dangerous to not only him but to others .
I am releasing this statement so my son , Johnny and others , will know that I am not a part of this plan .
Nor will I give my " DNA " or other requested information to those who are involved .
By no means is this an admission that I 'm giving up on seeing Johnny again but right now his safety as well as the safety of others is a prime concern .
I will not be a part of jeopardizing their safety .
The continued support and efforts of all those that have came forward over the years has been very significant in getting me to where we are today and I look forward to your continued support and prayers

HAPPY 40TH BIRTHDAY JOHNNY GOSCH
November 12 - Every Year
Johnny ,
Do you remember when you asked me to make this cake for you ?
You had seen a picture of it in a cookbook and thought a " blue castle cake " would be neat .
We went to the store and bought all the items and built this cake together .
You loved it so much you did n't want to ever cut it and eat it .
You were 5 years old in this photo .
I hope you have a Happy Birthday , where ever you are living .
Love , Mom
December 17 , 2008 - Adam Walsh Case
I am very happy to hear of the recent resolution on Adam Walsh 's case .
I understand how frustrating it is for parents of a missing child to not have closure .
John Walsh has been very vocal about the mistakes made in the investigation by the Hollywood , Fl. Police Dept .
In the end , they decided to review the evidence in the case and determined that Ottis Toole was indeed guilty of murdering Adam .
I urge the police in West Des Moines and Des Moines Iowa to do the same .
To review all the evidence on the following cases and work together to bring resolution :
Johnny Gosch kidnapped
9/5/82
Eugene Martin kidnapped 8/84
Marc Allen kidnapped 3/86 .
These three boys were all close to the same age and kidnapped from the Des Moines / West Des Moines , Iowa area .
To date there has been no resolution on any of the cases by authorities .
Why ?

July 12 , 2008 - NEW INFORMATION !
I have had the following composite drawing for some time and am releasing it now due to new information on Johnny 's case .
You will see one photo / composite is from 1982 the second is the same man approximately 10 years later .
There is further information concerning this man which will be released at a later time .
The second man involved in the kidnapping of Johnny Gosch , Sept. 5th , 1982 .
His name is Tony ...
He followed Johnny down the street shot Johnny with a stun gun and after he dropped to the ground , grabbed Johnny and threw him in the back seat of the kidnap car .
The dark areas on his cheeks are " severe pock marks from acne scarring " .
This has been consistent in the description given by all witness's .
This is a updated version of Tony approximately ten years after Johnny 's kidnapping , showing him with a different hairstyle .
He is wanted in at least 4 other kidnappings and the children have never been found .

February 14 , 2008 Most Recent Photo of Johnny Gosch
I received this photo recently , it is like so many others , as Johnny appears bound and gagged once again .
However , this photo has something very significant in the background .
It is a laundry bag from a " camp " .
The photo was taken in the early 1980's not long after my son was kidnapped .
This photo appeared on a Russian Pedophile Website around Thanksgiving 2007 and sent to me a short time later .
Someone has had it in their possession / collection for a very long time .
If there are viewers of my website who are familiar with this camp , please email me at : JGoschFoundation@aol.com
I would appreciate any information you may have to share .
I have obtained many photos of my son , as well as other boys which were taken in this same room .
Apparently this location was used for some activities with children .
September 05 , 2007 Johnny Gosch : 25 Years of Heart Break and Service
It 's a story that catapulted Iowa into the national spotlight , changed state law and continues to draw awareness to human trafficking .
It 's a recurring nightmare for parents across the nation ... and a living nightmare for Noreen Gosch that has unwillingly launched her into a life of public service .
On this day 25 years ago , Johnny Gosch left his home to work his Des Moines Register paper route .
What happened after that has been the subject of speculation .
According to Noreen Gosch , two men approached him , he was thrown into a vehicle and kidnapped .
" Last September I received a packet of photographs , " Gosch said during an abuse prevention conference in Cedar Rapids .
The image of a young boy , hog -tied and wearing only his underpants and socks illuminated the wall beside her .
" This is my son Johnny near the time when he was kidnapped .
His is still 12 - years - old in this picture . "
Gasps and sobs filled the hotel conference room on that day in May , but Gosch stood in quiet testimony to what she believed happened to her son 25 years ago .
" I knew immediately it was my son and it has also been confirmed by forensic specialists at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children who have examined and compared [ the photos ] with existing pictures I had , " she said .
West Des Moines police are no longer tracking the origin of the photos , reports the Register .
They stopped after a Florida investigator said the photos stemmed from a case he investigated prior to Johnny 's disappearance .
Early this morning , Gosch wrote a personal note to her son on the website she created in his honor .
" You are loved and missed by all of your family , " she wrote .
" It is important for you to know that we have tried everything possible to bring resolution to your case , to make it safe for you to live your life .
All of the information which we have researched and collected has been given to the FBI , it is in their hands now ...
If nothing is done then we will all know that they did not go forward with it .
" My hope is that the latest report saying you are still alive is true and that one day we will be able to see each other again . "
She also posted a list of the things she knows 25 years after her son was kidnapped .
She begins the list with noting how it all feels " like it was yesterday . "
Gosch believes her son was taken for the purpose of satisfying pedophiles , that he was sold into a human trafficking network .
She 's had reports that he is alive and living in fear his life will be ended by those who wish to silence his knowledge of the trafficking network .
And , of course , that the photos sent to her last fall are of her son and were taken shortly after he was kidnapped .
A month after Johnny was taken , Noreen founded The Johnny Gosch Foundation and developed a program called " In Defense of Children . "
She has toured the nation , providing nearly 1,000 personal appearances on missing children , law enforcement , human trafficking and overall awareness .
On July 1 , 1984 a bill she authored -- the Johnny Gosch Bill -- was passed into Iowa law .
It mandates immediate police involvement when a child is missing .
It has since been adopted by eight additional states .
That same year , she traveled to Washington , D.C. and testified before Congress as a part of hearings on organized crime .
Her testimony led to death threats and also , in part , the eventual establishment of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .
She was invited by Pres. Ronald Reagan to the opening and dedication of the center .
She has also worked on two documentaries , one for HBO and another for the State Department .
Her story and Johnny 's story was the focus of a book , " Why Johnny Can't Come Home " that originally published in 2000 .
September 5 , 2007 JOHNNY
You are loved and missed by all of your family .
It is important for you to know that we have tried everything possible to bring resolution to your case , to make it safe for you to live your life .
All of the information which we have researched and collected has been given to the FBI , it is in their hands now .....
If nothing is done then we will all know that they did not go forward with it .
My hope is that the latest report saying you are still alive is true and that one day we will be able to see each other again .
Love , Mom ________________________________________
TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER September 5th , 2007 is the 25th anniversary of the kidnapping of my son Johnny Gosch .
It is amazing how such a marking of time can many times still " feel like it was yesterday " .
He was kidnapped on September 5th , 1982 , while delivering his Des Moines Register Sunday paper .
There were a number of witness's to the kidnapping who all saw the men and the car .
After 25 years ....
This is what we now know : 1 . Johnny was a victim of a human / child trafficking network .
2 . He was taken for the purpose of satisfying pedophiles for a profit for those who took him .
3 . Reports say he is still alive , living under another identity .... still fearing for his life after escaping from the network a number of years ago .
4 . Many changes and progress have taken place since the plight of these missing children has been brought out to the public .
This happens only because of the continued work by the parents of the missing and those who are assisting us .
5 . Photos sent to me ARE MY SON ..... they have all been verified .
In addition to those photos I have received hundreds of other photos of children , some featured with pedophiles but all bound and gagged .
Those photos have been given to the FBI and we are in hopes they will do something .
6 . The work continues on Johnny 's case as there has not yet been any resolution .
I want to thank all of the people who have assisted me during these long 25 years .
The list is so long , it is impossible to name everyone but you all know who you are and what you have done to contribute .
I am most grateful .
Thank you , Noreen
June 18 , 2007 - TODAY'S NEWS !
Britain , U.S. break up online pedophile ring 700 investigated ; 31 children rescued as authorities shut global operation Suffolk Police Constabulary via AP
LONDON - British police , aided by U.S. authorities , have smashed a global Internet pedophile ring that broadcast live - streamed videos of children being abused , investigating more than 700 suspects worldwide and rescuing 31 children in a 10 - month probe , officials said Monday .
Some 200 suspects are based in Britain , said the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Center , a government agency .
Of the 31 children , some only a few months old , more than 15 were in Britain , the center said .
British authorities would not give a breakdown of where the other suspects or children came from , but said more than half the suspects in Britain were already being prosecuted .
The ring was traced to an Internet chat room called “ Kids the Light of Our Lives ” that featured images of children being subjected to horrific sexual abuse , including the streaming live videos .
Authorities said they used surveillance tactics normally used against terrorism suspects and drug traffickers to infiltrate the pedophile ring at its highest level .
Officials said the United States , Canada and Australia were Britain ’s main partners in the investigation , which involved agencies from 35 countries .
The international investigation dated back to August 2006 until the ringleader ’s sentencing Monday .
A tip from Canada
The international probe began after Canadian officials — conducting their own long - running pedophile investigation — tipped off authorities in London about a possible British link .
A Canadian official said authorities there have arrested 24 Canadians and rescued seven Canadian children since late 2005 .
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement joined the British - led operation in December .
U.S. officials declined to comment because their investigation is continuing in at least 12 states .
It was unclear whether any of the rescued children had been reported missing , but authorities said the investigation was not linked to the widely publicized disappearance of Madeleine McCann , a 4 - year - old British girl who vanished nearly two months ago in southern Portugal .
Toronto police conducted online surveillance along with British police , said Detective Sgt. Kim Scanlan of the Toronto police sex crimes unit , who confirmed the Canadian arrests and rescues of children that began before the British - led probe .
‘ It 's a good day ’
“ Every arrest we make we seize computers and information , so there are a number of ongoing investigations , ” Scanlan said .
“ There ’s just been great cooperation .
It ’s a good day , but it ’s one day out of many . ”
In Germany , police are investigating two men in connection with the breakup of the ring , the country ’s Federal Crime Office said .
The host of the chat room , Timothy David Martyn Cox , 27 , of Buxhall , who used the online identity “ Son of God , ” admitted to nine counts of possessing and distributing indecent images , authorities said .
Cox was given an indeterminate jail sentence Monday at a court in eastern England .
That means he will remain in prison until authorities determine he is no longer a threat to children .
“ Today ’s verdict serves as a powerful warning to those using the Internet to facilitate the sexual exploitation of children , ” said Jim Gamble , the child protection center ’s chief executive .
Cox was identified after intelligence linking the chat room to Britain was passed on to the child protection center by Canadian authorities in August 2006 .
The center is an agency under the Home Office that is made up of officers with special experience in tracking and prosecuting sex offenders .
Cox also had been a member of a U.S. - based online pedophile ring shut down by U.S. authorities in March 2006 , Gamble said .
‘ Son of God ’
The host of the “ Kiddypics ” and “ Kiddyvids ” site in the earlier case adopted the username “ G.O.D. , ” and Cox ’s online identity “ Son of God ” was believed to be a reference .
It was not immediately clear whether the ongoing U.S. investigation also involved that earlier site .
After Cox ’s arrest on Sept. 28 , 2006 , British , Canadian and Australian authorities were able to infiltrate the chat room and collect evidence on the other members .
Officers posed as contributors and even pretended to be Cox , running the chat room for 10 days .
At no point did officers distribute illegal images .
Forensic teams examining Cox ’s computer found 75,960 indecent and explicit images in addition to evidence that he had supplied 11,491 images to other site users .
A man described as Cox ’s lieutenant , Gordon Mackintosh , tried to resurrect the chat room in January .
Authorities in Britain , Canada , Australia and the U.S. again infiltrated the operation .
Upon Mackintosh ’s arrest in January , authorities assumed his identity online and ran the chat room for three days while collecting information on offenders who traded images .
Mackintosh , 33 , has pleaded guilty to 27 charges of making , possessing and distributing indecent images and videos .
He is awaiting sentencing .

Police arrest woman linked to China baby trafficking 2 hours , 16 minutes ago http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070619/wl_asia_afp/chinapopulationtraffickingarrest_070619080858
BEIJING ( AFP ) - A woman in China suspected of being involved in the trafficking of 118 baby girls has been arrested after four years on the run , state press reported Tuesday .
Ji Xiulan , believed to be aged in her 60s , had been a fugitive since the trafficking ring was busted in 2003 but was arrested in a village in central China 's Henan province on June 15 , the Beijing Times reported .
Ji was suspected of having been involved in buying trafficked babies from southern China 's Guangxi region , the report said .
The 2003 arrest of the ringleaders of the gang exposed a network of trafficking in baby girls that spread from Guangxi to Henan , Anhui and Hubei provinces in central and eastern China , the report said .
The case broke when police found 28 drugged and tied - up baby girls -- none over three months old -- in bags on board a bus bound for northern cities .
One of the babies died while being smuggled , reports at the time said .
In July 2004 , 54 people from Yulin city in Guangxi region were convicted of trafficking 118 girls between 2001 and 2003 .
Two people from Yulin were sentenced to death over that case and more than 100 outside Guangxi were convicted , of whom at least one was executed , state press reports at the time said .
The case has been linked to China 's " one child " family planning policy that has sharpened traditional values preferring boys over girls and leading to many mothers selling or giving away their baby daughters in the hopes of later having a son .
Many defendants in the case refused to admit wrongdoing , insisting they were providing a humanitarian service as many of the trafficked girls went to childless couples in cities , earlier press reports on the scandal said .

March 18 , 2007 UPDATE CONCERNING RECENT PHOTOS APPEARING ON MY WEBSITE
Thank you to those who provided the necessary information regarding the latest photos on my website .
Your information is appreciated .
Here is what we have learned !
These photos are frames from a video / movie which was made in another country ... it is believed to be Poland .
This film has many other frames which could not be shown due to their explicit and violent nature .
Films which are made with consenting adults is another story , issue , subject or any word people choose to describe it .
It is exploitation of a child which is the issue with this film .
However , there are a some unanswered questions .
Why is this film being circulated on pedophile websites ?
Why is this type of violence being done to a child on film ?
Who is the boy they are using ?
Some say the boy cooperated .....
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
Would you want your child appearing in such a film for the pleasure of pedophiles to view on their websites ?
Over the past five months , I have received hundreds of photos
There photos are of my son Johnny included , but also many other children .
The children in the photos are bound & gagged .
Upon close investigation of these photos , we have seen the following :
The children 's hands swollen , with a blue / purple color still with the ropes tightly on their wrists , cutting off their circulation .
Close ups of the children 's faces with tears running down their faces .
Deep red marks on their faces made from the tight gags in their mouth .
Rope burns on their wrists and ankles .
Obvious staining of their clothing showing signs of the sexual abuse ( sodomy ) they had received .
The physical , sexual , emotional abuse to children is continuing at an alarming rate in our country and world .
One aspect is .... Child / Human Trafficking .
Some are making a profit off from showing this material .... using other peoples children .
Everyone who reads this should be angry and concerned .
If they did this to my son , Johnny age 12 when he was kidnapped ... they can do it to your child next .
There is nothing preventing it ..
This type of criminal knows the laws are weak and most likely they would not be caught .
I take particular exception to this because one of the kids they kidnapped and used was my son ...... Johnny Gosch .

I have been contacted by many people who follow my website asking for me to post something concerning the kidnapping of the two boys in Missouri .
I feel a great deal of compassion for both boys and their families after what has happened to them .
There is still a great deal ahead for them concerning all of the legal issues but with the support of their families they will go on to live healthy productive lives .
James M. Rothstein , Ret. NYCPD
Detective is an expert in the field of investigation of pedophile activity and crimes against children .
Mr. Rothstein has been investigating Johnny 's case for over ten years and has written a very comprehensive report on the ORGANIZED PEDOPHILIA AND THE CRIMINAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN , which we no know as HUMAN TRAFFICKING .
He is sharing this report , it will shed light upon the issue of missing and exploited children in all categories .
Throughout the report , you will see that some names have been removed for legal reasons .
Mr. Rothstein has also proposed needed legislation which is included in the report .
Noreen CONFIDENTIAL REPORT ON ORGANIZED
PEDOPHILIA AND THE CRIMINAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN
By
JAMES M. ROTHSTEIN
RET .
NYCPD DETECTIVE
On the streets of every city in America there are thousands of children , both boys and girls , selling themselves into prostitution .
Almost nothing is done to discourage this .
Some of these children are on their own , others are preyed upon by older children who exploit them .
Surrounding and controlling these children , who have been manipulated and forced into utter physical , sexual , and emotional degradation in their daily lives , are their procurers and abusers who are even more depraved .
It is these procurers and abusers who criminally and sexually exploit these children for commercial purposes : pornography , prostitution , extortion , blackmail , and human compromise ; not to mention larceny , burglary , and other criminal activities .
Police make many arrests of child molesters and pedophiles who troll for children around bus terminals , arcades , and malls .
Rarely are the exploiters , who operate telephone call services , pedophile exchanges , sex clubs , and pornography rings , arrested and successfully prosecuted .
Despite public concern , even outrage , little is done beyond expressions of outrage .
Why is this ?
This certainly is not because there is a lack of information .
Everyday there are reports of children who are abducted or disappear off the face of the earth , or so it seems to the families who lose their children , when in fact they become the victims of a society which is divided into five separate groups : family , homosexual , commercial , serial killers and occult .
FAMILY – Within the family group you have an inherited or given trust between the children and their elders .
This group is made up of schools , institutions , religions , and step families .
Because of the close relationships between the elders and the children , if child abuse or pedophilia occurs , they are difficult to uncover and corroborate .
The schools , institutions , and religious sects become candy stores for the pedophile or child abuser .
There are many documented cases of pedophilia and child abuse within the family group throughout the United States , such as the Clemons case in Florida and the McMartin case in California .
Children are placed or held in institutions because of physical , mental , correctional or family problems .
In the early 1970 ’s , numerous children were taken from a Chicago institution and sent to Texas , to another institution where they were then used for sexual purposes .
( name deleted ) of the Illinois State Police investigated this case and stopped the practice .
Within the religious group an unprecedented number of cases are coming to light , such as the Porter case in Massachusetts .
Father Porter violated numerous altar boys over a span of twenty - five years in various parishes in Massachusetts .
When accusations are made against a Roman Catholic priest , the priests are transferred to another parish , diocese or religious institution and are allowed to continue their perverse habit without interference from the law .
St. Johns Abbey of the Benedictine Order , in Collegeville , Minnesota , is a classic example of how the Catholic Church covers up child abuse in the Church .
Over a 30 year period of time there were hundreds of abuse cases and suicides related to the abuse .
In 2002 , Josh Guimond , a student at St. Johns , disappeared in the middle of the night under suspicious circumstances .
The investigation that followed was a coverup and anyone who dared look into the case was harassed .
The Abbot , John Klassen , admitted that there were at least 13 pedophile priests at the Abbey .
Yet , there were no arrests or prosecutions by either local , state , or federal authorities over this 30 year period of time .
A sophomore at Albany High School , in Albany , Minnesota , asks , “ Why is St. Johns above the law ? ”
The local and state media keep their reports of the abuse which has occurred there to a bare minimum , and then only publishes these reports after they have appeared in the national media .
Why ?
The Porter case and others at the time brought to light a new investigative technique which has been referred to as repressed or recovered memory .
This psychological tool has been used in a number of cases prosecuting pedophiles and child abusers .
This novel approach has not yet been proven to be scientifically valid .
When this method is used without additional objective and corroborating evidence , wrongful accusations and prosecutions can result .
This problem is well documented in an article written by Lawrence Wright in the May 24 , 1993 , edition of New Yorker Magazine .
In this article , Mr. Wright describes how , in some cases , after additional research was done , this “ recovered memory ” method was shown to be flawed , causing those cases to fall apart and resulting in the needless and unwarranted destruction of the family .
As heinous as these crimes of sexual exploitation of children are , an over zealous uninformed law enforcement agency or prosecutor , who uses less than scientific investigative methods to conduct a “ witch hunt , ” can wreak havoc on our society .
Abusive , unwarranted prosecutions based on unscientific and improper investigative methods used by police and prosecutors do not help to provide any real solution to this problem of the criminal sexual exploitation of children .
Rather , they consume valuable and very limited resources and help allow many offenders to continue their crimes against children un-abated .
This novel approach “ recovered memory ” is an interesting new method , but it must be closely monitored until it is an exact science , and there must be additional corroboration with its use in any prosecution .
HOMOSEXUAL –
For the purpose of this report , the true homosexual pedophile is distinct from the more violent serial killers described later .
The homosexual believes he is not hurting the child , but is in fact offering him a better life style .
The child is given all the worldly possessions they desire and are told that their parents do not want him .
This is a common and effective ploy used to keep the child .
After the child has been in the clutches of the pedophile community for more than seventy - two hours , that child is generally lost to society .
The child ’s fear of parents and friends finding out about the degradation in which that child has been involved , keeps that child from leaving .
A notorious homosexual pedophile and procurer , Ben Rose , is a classic example of the mentality observed in this group .
Ben Rose was arrested after an investigation by the New York Police Department at his residence on St. Mark ’s Place in New York City during the summer of 1972 .
At the time of the arrest , he had in his possession three young boy ages 14 - 15 years , who had been transported by him from Baltimore to New York City for the specific purpose of sexual exploitation .
Upon his arrest , he agreed to cooperate with the New York City Police Department and an investigation was begun under the code name GAFF .
This investigation uncovered the commercial part of pedophilia and child abuse .
COMMERCIAL –
The commercial group includes child pornography , prostitution , pimping , extortion , and human intelligence .
Child pornography , prostitution , and pimping are well organized and promoted throughout the pedophile community .
Because of Ben Rose ’s cooperation with investigators , many of the rumors and information under investigation were verified .
He informed the New York City Detectives that in November of 1971 , three boys , ages 14 - 15 years , were sexually abused and then murdered in his apartment on East 64th Street in New York City by three men he identified as Dr. ( name deleted ) ( a surgeon ) , ( name deleted ) ( OPEC ) , and ( name deleted ) ( CIA ) .
The bodies were then transported to Connecticut by car and then buried on a farm .
Under the GAFF investigation these murders were to be assigned to other investigators in the New York City Police Department , but then disappeared in the hierarchy of the Department .
A second investigation conducted in the mid 1970 ’s , by the Police Department during which thirteen homicides , plus the murder of these 14 - 15 year old boys at Ben Rose ’s apartment , were investigated under the code name OPERATION TOGETHER .
This investigation was under the command of Deputy Inspector John Colin .
At a critical point in the investigation , it was stopped .
Inspector Colin was demoted and forced into retirement .
The third investigation was done by the New York State Select Committee on Crime .
This Committee served subpoenas on both ( name deleted ) and ( name deleted ) .
When ( name deleted ) was served with the subpoena and questioned by the detectives , he informed them that because he worked for the CIA , the subpoena would be quashed , invoking National Security .
He was correct , because before the detectives returned to their offices , the subpoena was withdrawn .
One wonders what part of the National Security Act allows the murder of children .
( name deleted ) was also served , questioned , and appeared at the committee ’s offices .
He did not testify .
As in all cases of this magnitude , the attorney who represented these politically connected pedophiles was Enid Gerling of New York , who also represented both ( names deleted ) .
Enid Gerling stated at that time that the investigation was on the right track and should not stop .
In conversations with Gerling over the past number of years , she has often stated that she owes these individuals no allegiance and would gladly give them up .
During the investigation by the New York State Select Committee on Crime , information was received that Roy Cohn ( famed attorney who represented Senator Joe McCarthy at the notorious McCarthy Hearings ) helped in covering up the murder and the disposal of the bodies .
When Cohn was questioned about the murder of the three 14 - 15 year old boys at Ben Rose ’s apartment , he stated that he was aware of what had happened , but would comment no further .
Information at that time was that Cohn was often used to compromise people and , if situations such as those described by Rose occurred , Cohn would take care of them .
Rose also supplied information as to the methamphetamine sales in juice bars owned by organized crime .
These bars were meeting places for children , pedophiles , and various pedophile rings .
The investigation into this activity was again buried in the hierarchy of the Police Department and not investigated .
As a direct result of this investigation , Police Officer Richard Johnson of the New York City Police Department , a primary investigator , became the subject of a bombing of his residence .
Recent information is that the contract was ordered by someone inside the New York City Police Department .
This case is unsolved and the cover up continues to this day .
In the summer of 1966 , at 301 West 45 Street , one of the most notorious procurers of children , Willie Dunn , was caught with eight young boys in his apartment .
These boys ranged in age from 14 - 17 years .
The boys were let go and Dunn was sent on his way based on the faulty premise asserted by the police department hierarchy that no crime had been directly observed .
Over the years
Dunn perfected his ways of procuring children to the point where he traveled the United States in a Winnebago Motor Home kidnapping , picking up , and transporting children to pedophiles wherever they were needed .
In 1977 - 78 , Willie Dunn was on trial in Norfolk , Virginia , by federal authorities for charges stemming from a stolen check fraud .
In US vs Dunn , in Norfolk Federal Court , Dunn , acting as his own attorney , was able to tell the court that he was in fact a victim because of the Bronfman kidnapping .
The case was covered for the media by Penciak of the Associated Press and when the story was given to the New York Press , it only ran in the first edition .
Another investigation led to a major supplier of children to pedophiles throughout the United States .
In 1977 , information was obtained from a high level informant , Dale Smith aka Dale St - Clair , who was in the child prostitution business .
Dale Smith had inside information that a Paul Abrams was a procurer with connections to other procurers .
They had stables with substantial stocks of flesh available .
Abrams catered to the so - called elite , influential , and wealthy of our society .
With Dale Smith ’s information , evidence was developed for a wiretap order .
When the District Attorney , ( name deleted ) of New York , was approached for a wiretap order , he refused , knowing full well that it would expose many prominent people as pedophiles .
On November 28 , 1977 , Paul Abrams ’ operation at 230 Central Park West in New York City , was raided by the New York City Police Department .
The New York Daily News , at the time , stated hundreds and hundreds of names were found in the raid .
These actions prevented a full scale investigation , which is always the case .
During the summer of 1967 , a well organized movement of prostitutes into New York City by pimps throughout the United States was observed .
Young girls were shipped back and forth across the country as they were needed .
The core cities were Minneapolis , Minnesota , and Columbus , Ohio , with most major cities in the United States used as sales outlets .
New York City Detectives were able to establish a liaison with Minneapolis and Columbus .
Information was exchanged and a pattern developed .
In the mid 1970 ’s , members of the New York City Police Department were able to convince investigators of the IRS and agents from the FBI to join the investigation .
A joint investigation was launched and eleven of the top twelve pimps were convicted of various crimes , virtually breaking the back of the organization .
Prostitution is not a victimless crime .
The victim is the prostitute .
The intelligence obtained over this period of time made it possible to locate missing girls from across the United States , who had fallen into prostitution , to be located in a matter of days either dead or alive .
After the cases were completed , the FBI agents were given different assignments .
In 1976 - 77 , the New York State Select Committee on Crime conducted hearings on prostitution .
Testimony was given by a number of prostitutes from around the United States describing their activities .
A film was produced by Brian Kelly which graphically describes how these children were abused and murdered .
The hierarchy of the New York City Police Department refused to cooperate with the investigation and hearings , in fact , harassed the detectives assigned to the investigation .
HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
– is a fancy way of describing how the Intelligence Community uses children to compromise anybody they deem necessary .
Extortion and human intelligence often are byproducts of pornography and prostitution .
In 1992 , after two hours of conversation with Michael Ricconiscutto ( who has admitted a long involvement with ( names deleted ) , and other covert operations ) concerning the types of operations he had been involved in during his lifetime , it became apparent that he had become involved at a very young age .
When asked , he stated that at the age of 13 , while visiting Chile with members of the Chilean Council , he was recruited by ( name deleted ) of the CIA .
At this point Ricconiscutto was asked if he had been in fact become a “ chicken ” , a term used by pedophiles to represent the children they prey on .
He stated “ Yes , and that he had also been trained in the fine art of human intelligence . ”
The Catholic Church has become a victim of compromise .
At the end of WWII , James “ Jesus ” Angelton , of the OSS - CIA , was able to compromise the Vatican and thereby allow what was known as “ ODESSA ” to get a foothold into the Vatican .
Years later Bishop Hnilica helped the KGB to exert their influence on the Vatican .
After these two influences were in place , they were able to expand on a weakness in the church , PEDOPHILIA .
This led to the scandal that has been exposed in the Catholic Church , which is only the tip of the iceberg .
For instance , from the days of Cardinal Spellman ( nicknamed “ NELLIE ” , a known pedophile ) in New York City to the present , no scandals have been made public .
There is no way that these hidden scandals will be made public as long as ( name deleted ) or someone like him is the District Attorney in New York City .
Any District Attorney or Prosecutor who routinely covers up these crimes against children by politically connected pedophiles , assures these crimes against children will remain hidden from the public .
SERIAL KILLERS –
This group consists of individuals who are sadistic in attaining their sexual pleasures .
These individuals usually live in their own world and are by far the most dangerous and difficult to identify .
Within this group the victims are generally tortured , mutilated , and sexually abused .
These offenders tend to be loners and their crimes often occur in different police jurisdictions .
This alone makes it difficult for law enforcement to establish links and patterns between their crimes , thus limiting the effectiveness of their investigations .
In many cases these perpetrators will move from town to town or state to state to avoid discovery and prosecution .
Often they go undetected because law enforcement is so localized .
The case histories of two notorious serial killers , Ted Bundy and Geoffrey Dahmer , leave no doubt that law enforcement is ill equipped to deal with these types of serial killers .
In both cases , officers failed to recognize clues that could have curtailed these killings at earlier stages of the investigations .
OCCULT – Satanic worship , with its many subculture groups , usually revolves around secret societies comprised of individuals who worship Satan or some other god to which they offer sacrifices .
These sacrifices may be animal or human .
In Aroostook County , Maine , in late 1988 , two Catholic parish priests were approached by a parishioner who stated that persons known to her wanted to sacrifice her young baby .
The priests , shocked by this revelation , discussed the matter among themselves and , at the time of the child ’s baptism , footprinted the baby .
They stated that this was done so that if at any time the child disappeared or died , a record would be on file for the authorities .
In Matamores , Mexico , a young American college student was abducted from the streets and sacrificed in a satanic ritual .
This particular ritual had been described to New York Detectives by Maria Lazo , a high priestess in the occult , during Operation Together .
In his book The Ultimate Evil , respected author Maury Terry wrote about the “ Son of Sam ” killings in New York City .
At the time of David Berkowitz ’s arrest , the official line of the New York Police Department was that Son of Sam had acted alone in the murders .
In his subsequent investigation , Maury Terry discovered that these “ Son of Sam ” killings were , in fact , satanic ritual killings .
During Berkowitz ’s imprisonment , after his conviction and sentencing , Maury Terry has had repeated interviews with him .
During these interviews Berkowitz gave Maury Terry inside information about what was actually involved in these rituals and subsequent murders associated with them .
Ken Lanning , who was the spokesman for the FBI , has stated on many occasions that there are no documented cases of satanic murders .
This is hard to believe , but the FBI has had a policy of not getting involved in the actual investigations and , therefore , relies on its information from reading other law enforcement reports .
The FBI , under present mandates , does not have jurisdiction in many instances .
An incident in early 1980 , may best illustrate the mentality of the FBI and its agents .
An unnamed FBI agent met with retired New York City Detective James Rothstein and stated that he was about to be assigned to an investigation into the world of pedophilia .
He asked just how far he could go with such an investigation , without suffering the consequences , such as being transferred to Montana .
He was advised accordingly .
The information contained in this report is based upon hundreds of investigations and observations made by Detective Rothstein , between 1968 and 1980 , as a Detective in the New York City Police Department .
Thousands of interrogations and interviews were conducted with prostitutes , pimps , and pedophiles .
Detective Rothstein has testified as an expert in both Federal and State Courts on prostitution , pimping , and pornography .
Since his retirement in 1980 , Detective Rothstein has remained active in following up on the investigations he started during his career with the New York City Department .
As a result of this continued research of over twenty - five years , he has developed a national and international network of researchers and investigators who document the ongoing occurrence and extent of pedophilia and child abuse worldwide .
This network has discovered a major increase in this criminal sexual exploitation of our children throughout the United States of America , and as well as for children worldwide in recent years .
Through his ongoing research efforts and frequent communications with these other researchers , Detective Rothstein has noted the emergence of certain patterns and profiles associated with this serious and criminal sexual exploitation of our children .
In most investigations into pedophilia and child abuse , the investigators , federal and local , will initially do an honest and in - depth investigation , but when a certain level of progress is attained , the investigations are stopped or compromised .
Again one asks the question , “ Why is this ? ”
To this date there is no high profile case that has ever been investigated to the fullest extent and then prosecuted in the court of the United States .
Why ?
Three examples of this can be found in the following cases : a ) The Finders – Florida and Washington D.C. ; b) Franklin Coverup – Nebraska ; c ) St. Johns Abbey – Minnesota .
In segments of the family , homosexual , commercial , serial killer , and the occult , the pedophile and child abuser feel that they are above the law .
They believe that because of their contacts , position in society , or the secrecy of their actions , if caught , they can use these connections to coverup their criminal activities .
In most cases this is true and known throughout the pedophile subculture .
In April of 2005 , information was received from a “ source ” who stated he had been a Field Analyst for the CIA .
The “ source ” stated that , as a result of the Johnny Gosch kidnapping on September 5 , 1982 , he and 19 others were assigned to do an investigation to make sure that the CIA or a rogue element of the CIA was not involved in using children .
The fear was that Foreign Intelligence operations would classify them as a bunch of pedophiles .
The “ source ” stated he was selected because of “ special qualifications ” he had , which would allow him to penetrate this subculture .
Johnny Gosch was the first of three similar kidnappings that the “ source ” stated were conducted by the same group of kidnappers .
All three victims were newspaper delivery boys .
The second kidnapping was Eugene Martin .
Gosch and Martin were from Des Moines , Iowa .
The third intended victim was a local newspaper delivery boy from St. Joseph , Minnesota .
When interviewed , he stated he was able to escape by slipping out of his coat and running .
When this kidnapping failed , a second attempt was made and Jacob Wetterling was kidnapped .
To this date , none of these crimes have been solved .
Why ?
The “ source ” stated that their investigation continued until 1989 .
The evidence uncovered during this investigation proved that 834 children were kidnapped and used by this subculture .
This is only the tip of the iceberg of the depravity that was uncovered .
The evidence was passed up to higher authorities in the Agency , where , as always , the hierarchy covered it up .
The most comprehensive and accurate book about an actual kidnapping and the usual cover up that occurs , was written by the mother of Johnny Gosch , Noreen N. Gosch , Why Johnny Ca n’t Come Home .
The book is written by a courageous mother who refused to accept the usual coverup , lies , and failures of all law enforcement agencies and others who were involved in the nonexistent investigation of her son ’s kidnapping .
The “ names deleted ” inserts were done to protect the guilty ( sad to say ) but are available .
MY SUGGESTIONS FOR NEEDED LEGISLATIONBi Partisan congressional investigation and Public Hearings
Hearings to be aired publicly
Special Prosecutor and Grand JuryAnyone invoking 5 amendment rights during the Congressional hearings would be put in front of the Grand Jury .
The Grand Jury would also subpoena appropriate witnesses .
The Grand Jury would return recommendations , findings and indictments .
Laws to be passed :
Any enforcement agency , agent , prosecutor , or any authority failing to act on pedophilia or the criminal use of children complaint by doing a complete investigation is guilty of a crime .
( felony )
Any person , agency , or other entity who interferes , threatens , harasses , impedes , or in anyway compromises an investigation , prosecution , or witness in pedophile criminal case or criminal use of children case is guilty of a felony with mandatory 5 year prison sentence .
Anyone who uses children , for child porn , pedophilia , to compromise , extort or cause another person to do an unwilling act is guilty of a felony punishable by death .
( life in prison , no parole )
Anyone who buys , sells , trades or in any way promotes , enables , or profits from pedophilia , human compromise , or the use of children in a criminal manner is guilty of a felony punishable by death .
( life in prison , no parole )

These are the most recent photos of Johnny which were sent to me .
We estimate they were all taken within the first few months after he was kidnapped .
It further supports the information we have indicating Johnny was taken for the purpose of " human trafficking " .
Each time I look at photos of him in this situation , the sadness spreads over me as I realize over and over how much my son has endured at the hands of these people .
Johnny is one of many children who have been used in this manner .
How can any of them sleep at night for what they do to our children .......

There are fetish groups , on yahoo and MSN , who appear to be obsessed with tying up young boys .
Perhaps some of the members of these groups are having second thoughts about what the people behind the scenes do or are capable of serial and obsessive photographing of boys tied up .
These men , who are driven by their unhealthy desires and fantasies trawl web sites such as Web shots and steal any photo they can find of kids in tied up fun situations ( they do happen . )
The parent innocently shares there photo only to have the photo stolen by fetishists who often pose as young adults or teens .
They spend endless hours trawling Yahoo Images , Google Images , etc for any photo they can find of a kid tied up , handcuffed etc .
Then they post them in public and private groups for purposes they probably do not entirely comprehend themselves .
What is much worse however is the serial photo's often taken by parents or much older siblings , relatives or care - givers .
In many cases we are also finding children who have been kidnapped appearing on these web sites .
Some of the kids have been identified recently .
These photos often eventually become known on public pedophile fronts .
This is an issue parents are going to need to confront as a culture of tolerance and acceptance appears to be occurring in regards to adults using children to pursue their sexual fantasies .
They see as " ONLY LOOKING " is not a crime or sin .
Some members , of these groups however , are beginning to see things for what they really are ..... a sick crime .
They are opening their minds , not to the hidden people saying this is ok , it is part of what you are , it is art of the innocent aspect of your childhood .
They are becoming savvy to the fact that there are pedophiles lurking in these groups or those who would benefit financially or otherwise .
Some are now prepared to confront the fact that the people they thought were their friends , may be , and sometimes are , pedophiles .
Many lies and half truths are told in relation to these photos and they are now seeing what these kinds of photos represent , or , what they wish them to represent .
It is to these people who do have some conscience , who are bothered by this ..... that I appeal for you to come forward , either anonymously , and make known what information you may have .
It is to the members of these groups , I make this appeal .
Below this message are two more photos I have received recently .
The first photo is my son , Johnny Gosch .
The second photo is unidentified .
Noreen N. Gosch UNIDENTIFIED BOY ... IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION
CONCERNING THIS BOY , PLEASE CONTACT THE
JOHNNY GOSCH FOUNDATION .
November 13 , 2006
November 09 , 2006 On October 30 , 2006 , I received this third picture of my son Johnny Gosch .
October 29 , 2006
Who are these boys ?
Why are they on a pedophile website ?
If you any information about these children , please call The National Center for Missing and Exploited children at 1-800-843-5678
October 26 , 2006
From the day I posted the photo of the three boys the following has taken place .
I received emails from people saying I should n't have placed this photo on my website because it was disturbing .
Then shortly after the middle boy was identified but no info could be released due to the parent not wanting publicity .
I received emails telling me " YOU HAD BETTER POST WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS BOYS IDENTITY ..... ASAP OR YOU WILL LOSE ALL CREDIBILITY " .
In other words a threat .
Approximately three weeks later , the mother of the boy in the middle did reconsider and wanted to tell her story .
We placed a few paragraphs of information about David Johnson on the site .
Since that date , I have received a number of emails from people who seem to have issues concerning Patricia Johnson Holm .
I have received threatening email and written attacks directed towards me .
My intent from the moment I received the photos was to identify the photos of the boys , who were found on a pedophile website , perhaps some people have lost sight of that part of this tragedy .
We have received more photos of unidentified boys which have been turned over to the National Center For Missing Children for comparison in their database of missing children .
Human trafficking is a huge problem , nearly 100,000 children yearly are trafficked .
It is still my mission to continue protecting children and gaining information on the hundreds of children who are unidentified to date .
If anyone has any issues concerning Patricia or her son , it would be best if you contact her directly as she would be better able to answer your questions .
Her email address is : ruprose2002a@yahoo.com
Thank you Noreen
October 24 , 2006
Three weeks ago , we made contact with Patricia Johnson Holm , the mother of one of the boys in the photo which had been brought to my door .
At that time she did not want additional publicity .
Since that time she has seen the interview the Fla .
Detective did with Fox TV / Greta
Show and is shocked that the detective is again trying to discredit the photo and both of our sons .
She has now reconsidered and is willing to share her story and the photo .
David Johnson is the boy in the middle in the photo of the three boys .
The boy on the left is another boy from the Seattle area and the boy on the right is my son Johnny Gosch .
Here are the details of David Johnson .
Full name : David Leonard Johnson born May 2 , 1972 at Virginia Mason Hospital , Seattle , WA .
Blond hair medium long , blue eyes , long dark eyelashes , healthy thin , long legged had an identifiable birth mark .
But not going to indicate where , due to needing to use it for identification .
Approx . 5 ' 5 " at the time .
David was kidnapped 4/1/85 from 20426 Damson Rd. , Lynnwood , WA .
Terryle Lee Holm ( David 's stepfather ) was supposed to be caring for David during the trip to James Allen Haugen Jr.'s Confirmation on Palm Sunday at Our Savior Lutheran in Tigard , Or. Terryle was instrumental in the situation that caused David to be punished and not allowed to go to his favorite Cousin 's Confirmation .
David attended Hilltop Elementary right after we moved to Lynnwood .
It was just across the street from 20426 Damson Rd .
He attended until 6th grade , prior to going to the local middle school only for a short time , after that he attended Private school .
Here is Patricia 's phone number :

October 19 , 2006 Dear Friends ,
The detective from Florida has once again tried to convince the public that Johnny was not in the photo of the three boys , who were bound and gagged on a bed .
We had this photo on my website for a time .
Three weeks ago .
we were contacted by the parents of two of the boys .
We have verified that the children were missing / abducted and have removed that photo by request of the parents .
We also have an eye witness who identified all three boys , ( including Johnny ) the communication was made possible by the attorney representing the witness .
From the moment I received the photos I stated that it was my intent to try and locate the parents to bring some peace to them .
We have done that and we are now concentrating on resolving the origin of Johnny 's photos .
The other parents do not want further press coverage at this time in their lives so we are respecting their wishes .
Yesterday , the Greta show on Fox TV called me to discuss the current photos on my website of Johnny and the latest from the Florida detective .
Greta show said " there is a different bedspread in one photo of Johnny than the other and that constituted a discrepancy . "
I did suggest that the young woman speaking to me , consult a dictionary and look up the word discrepancy .
I then explained that pedophiles always take many photos of their victims , changing backgrounds , poses , clothing or not and buy / sell them just like people do with baseball cards .
But there is certainly no discrepancy .
I declined to appear on Greta 's show last night , I believe the intent was to make a " dog and pony show " out of this situation .
She had the Florida detective on who still made his claims that the photo was not Johnny .
He still cannot find his files , folders or any information , because it was kept on index ( recipe ) cards .
He also stated that he responded to an anonymous note , then a phone call from a 40 year old man who claimed he was the boy in the photo and it was not Johnny .
How can he make a determination with just a phone call .
That 40 yr. old man could be anyone making a call .
Why is the public to believe any of this is accurate ?
This Florida detective has such an " unusual interest " in Johnny and this case , it makes me wonder WHY .
Pedophiles are a reality ... they are doing business as usual ... but the recent media attention to a " kidnapped boy from WEST DES MOINES IOWA ending up on a pedophile website is publicity I am sure they did not want and are eager to see this come to an end .
So here comes the Florida detective with his recipe cards to do just that .... try to put an end to it .
It only took them a few days to come up with this after the second photo of Johnny was posted on my website .
Is anyone else noticing the timing of these statements coming out of Florida ?
I am posting this for all of the loyal people who visit my site and have taken the time to write very kind , encouraging emails to me .
The pain a parent goes through when a child is taken is unthinkable .
If they did this to my son and me ... they can do it to anyone 's child .

Now that I ’m working for IBM ’s WebAhead group , building and supporting applications that are being used by tens of thousands of my fellow IBMers , I have n’t come across a single use case where WS -* would be a suitable fit .
Obasanjo :
The only times I encounter someone with good things to say about WS -* is if it is their job to pimp these technologies or they have already “ invested ” in WS -* and want to defend that investment .
Vinoski : Finally , I realized that WS -* was simply not worth it to any customer or to me .
I remember the days when it was basically just Mark Baker and me shouting “ The WS - King has no WS - clothes and there are WS - bleeding - sores on his WS - butt ! ”
The easy advice for the CIOs and CTOs of the world is “ Just do n’t buy that crap ” .
The more difficult advice is “ In future , carefully consider the motives and world - views of those who were trying to convince you to buy that crap . ”
It ’s OK , CIOs and CTOs do n’t read ongoing .
Anyhow , we ’re still a minority ; I get email every day from people advertising products and services and courses and advice on “ SOA Governance ” .
Motives and world - views , remember ?
One of stories of the day is poor Donald ’s assertion that the “ virus affects virtually nobody . ”
Where did he get that formulation ?
Technically speaking , no body can be affected by virtual reality or simulation .
The internet is not affected by the virus .
Was somebody providing a technical explanation that he simply misunderstood ?
Is the word as used an adjective or an adverb ?

It seems no matter what anyone does , there always remain statements which are true , but which can not be proven within the system .

Kurt Gödel was a mathematician and logician , born in 1906 in Brünn , then part of the empire of Austria - Hungary ( now known as Brno , and in the Czech Republic ) .
He fled Austria following the Anschluss , travelling to the USA by train across Siberia and via Japan , eventually becoming an American citizen after World War II .
Gödel is best known for his work in formal mathematical logic , and in particular a result that he proved , which is known as Gödel 's incompleteness theorem .
[ Aside : I 've attempted to explain a lot of quite complicated things in science and mathematics in simple terms in comic annotations before , but frankly this one is by far the most daunting .
In fact , I 've mentioned it before , in # 1068 , but I shied away from trying to explain it in any detail .
Feeling somewhat like I took the soft option that time , I 'm giving it a go now .
I just hope I can do it justice . ]
Gödel 's famous incompleteness theorem ( he actually produced two " incompleteness " theorems , but one is much better known ) states :
For any consistent , non-trivial , formal , computably enumerable theory that proves basic arithmetical truths , an arithmetical statement that is true , but not provable in the theory , can be constructed .
That is , any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete .
- formulation taken from Wikipedia , with addition of the word " non-trivial " .
This is a pretty dense couple of statements , full of words with precise mathematical definitions .
Let 's try to break it down .
A formal theory is a way of doing mathematics by manipulating symbols according to strict rules .
A simple example is given by the way we do addition .
Normally when doing addition we do n't really think about the symbols for the numbers ; we sort of think about the numbers " themselves " , whatever that means .
We work out in our heads by applying a few ingrained rules learnt by heart early in our educations that 12 plus 34 is equal to 46 .
We do n't really have to think very hard to do this .
To do this addition formally , we first need to define our symbols .
In this case , they are the numerals 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and the two symbols + and =.
Next we need to define our rules .
In the case of addition , the rules are as follows :
All the basic results of adding two single - digit numbers together .
e.g. 0+0=0 , 0+1=1 , ... , 1+2=3 , ... 9+9=18 .
In other words , the basic addition table .
The rules of how to add together multi - digit numbers using the above rules .
i.e.
You start at the right - most digits , add those , determine if you need to carry a digit , etc .
Now this is in fact how we first learn to do addition , since it is a precise method that always gives the correct answer if you do it properly .
So this formal theory of addition is really just how we do addition from basic steps , with all the rules explicitly defined .
An important feature of this theory of addition is that you can then use the system to prove any statement of addition .
" Prove " in this context has a very precise meaning .
It means that you can take a statement written in symbols , like 79+3=82 , and generate that sequence of symbols using nothing but the explicitly defined rules of the theory .
How does one generate this sequence of symbols ?
The simplest method is to start with the numbers before the equals sign ( 79 and 3 ) and add them using our rules .
That produces 82 , and we know we can write the resulting sum as 79+3=82 .
That proves ( using the rules of our theory ) that the statement is correct .
The important thing to note is that we are doing all of this merely by manipulation of symbols .
We do n't have to think about , understand , or even know that there exist semantic meanings for these symbols .
We do n't need to know that " 79 " can mean a number of objects .
In other words , we could teach this sort of addition to someone without explaining to them that the symbol " 3 " means " three " .
We can instruct a computer to do addition like this without the computer having any understanding of what it means to have three objects .
All the computer is doing is manipulating a bunch of arbitrary symbols based upon a set of well - defined rules .
If you set up a formal theory of mathematics correctly , you should be able to prove any true statement , and be unable to prove any false statement .
This is true of our simple theory of addition .
In fact , we can prove every true statement about the addition of two non-negative integers with nothing more than what I have described so far .
To do this , perform the following steps :
Start with two numbers 0 and 0 ; remember these .
Work out the addition of these two numbers according to the rules of addition , and write the result ( in this case : 0+0=0 ) .
If the two numbers we are remembering are equal , add 1 to the second number .
But if the two numbers are unequal then check the second number :
If it is not 0 , increase the first number by 1 and decrease the second by 1 .
But if the second number is 0 , set it equal to the first number plus 1 , and set the first number back to 0 .
Work out : ( first number ) +( second number ) and add that to our list of results .
Return to step 2 .
This procedure works out the following sums in this order : 0+0 , 0+1 , 1+0 , 0+2 , 1+1 , 2+0 , 0+3 , 1+2 , 2+1 , 3+0 , 0+4 , ... Now , no matter what true statement of addition we can think of , say 75843+87249=163092 , this procedure will eventually produce a proof that it is true .
It may take a long time , but it will eventually get there .
This is what the " computably enumerable " bit of Gödel 's theorem means : there is some procedure by which we can ( eventually ) generate any possible proof in the theory .
Addition of non-negative integers all by itself is a pretty limited domain , though .
In fact , this theory of addition is in some sense trivial .
It dos n't allow us to make any particularly interesting statements about the properties of numbers .
What you really want to make this theory interesting , in a non-trivial sense , is a bunch of new symbols .
Symbols that allow you to make much grander statements about the theory of numbers .
Logical symbols .
Here are a few :
a : This symbol means a number , but not any specific number .
If you know any algebra at all , this should be comfortably familiar .
If not , just think of it as standing for any number you care to think of .
It could be 7 , or 392 , or 47282994 , or anything .
By extension , we can consider any letter to stand for an arbitrary number .

By extension , we can consider any letter to stand for an arbitrary number .
∀ ( " for all " ) :
This symbol must be combined with a letter , like this : ∀ a .
It means that whatever statement follows is to be considered for all possible numerical values of a .
( " for all " ) :
This symbol must be combined with a letter , like this : ∀ .
It means that whatever statement follows is to be considered for all possible numerical values of .
∃ ( " there exists " ) :
This symbol must also be combined with a letter , like this : ∃ b .
This symbol means that there is some numerical value for b so that the following statement is true .
( " there exists " ) :
This symbol must also be combined with a letter , like this : ∃ .
This symbol means that there is some numerical value for so that the following statement is true . : :
This is just a colon to separate the two qualifying symbols above from the actual statement that follows .
∀a ∃b : a + b = a
This may be a lot to swallow in one hit , so let 's look at an example :
What this says is that for every possible number , there exists another number ( maybe different , maybe the same , it does n't matter ) , so that the statementis true .
In other words : for every number , there is another number which when added to the first number gives the first number as the answer .
You can probably work out that the numberwe are talking about is zero .
For every number , if you add zero , you get your original number as the answer .
This statement does not say that " if you add zero to a numberyou get the same number " ; what it is saying is that " for every number , there is some numberthat when added to first number gives you the same number " .
This is not a statement about the the answer to an addition of two numbers .
It is a statement about the existence of a certain number with a specific property ( that is defined in terms of addition ) .
These few symbols are extremely powerful enhancements of our theory .
But to go along with them , we also need to add some new rules , governing how to manipulate sequences of symbols which contain them .
Otherwise we'd have no way to actually prove ( within our formal theory ) that such a number as zero exists .
At this point , let it suffice to say that such rules do exist .
They are too complex for me to go into detail here in what is already in danger of becoming the most deeply theoretical of any of my scientific annotations .
But rest assured they exist , and they allow the proof ( within the formal system ) of statements like this .
Another very powerful enhancement to our theory of numbers would be this :
× : Multiplication .
( We could use a dot instead of a cross , as advanced mathematicians often do - the actual symbol makes no difference . )
: Multiplication .
( We could use a dot instead of a cross , as advanced mathematicians often do - the actual symbol makes no difference . )
( ) : Parentheses to group numbers , as per the usual grouping rules of arithmetic .
∀a : a × 0 = 0 ( any number multiplied by 0 equals 0 )
∀a : a × 1 = a ( any number multiplied by 1 equals itself )
∀a ∀b ∀c : a × ( b + c ) = a×b + a×c ( the distributive law of addition )
Now we can make statements like this :
And the cool thing is that within the expanded formal theory ( which I have n't described fully ) you can prove these statements by doing nothing more than manipulating the symbols according to the rules of the system .
We can also make statements like this :
∀a : a + a = 0 ( any number added to itself equals 0 )
∀a ∃b : a + b = 0 ( for every number , there is another number that when added to it gives 0 )
The first statement is simply false .
If we add 1+1 we get 2 , not 0 .
And the nice thing is that youprove this statement within the formal theory .
It 's a false statement about numbers , and you can't prove it to be true within the theory .
Yeah , nice .
The second statement is more interesting .
So far we 've only been talking about non-negative integers .
I have n't introduced the concept of subtraction , or even the minus sign symbol , at all yet .
Within our theory as it stands , this statement is false .
Given a non-negative integer a , it 's possible ( in fact highly likely ) that there is no such non-negative integer b so that a +b=0 .
ASIDE : This is slightly off the main track of this annotation , but it 's so amazingly stunning that I feel compelled to divert briefly into a further exploration of this last statement .
No doubt many of you are thinking that there are such numbers so that given any number a you can find a number b so that a +b=0 .
We call them negative numbers .
If a is 3 , then b is - 3 .
It 's just that ( for some reason ) I 'm not considering them at the moment .
You are of course correct .
The statement points out a deficiency in the sorts of numbers we are considering .
It points us to the existence of more numbers , with different properties to the sort of numbers we were originally talking about .
When negative numbers were first conceived of by mathematicians , they were controversial and regarded by many with scepticism .
After all , you can see 3 apples .
What does - 3 apples look like ?
It makes no sense !
The very concept of - 3 is absurd !
To people with a simplistic understanding of numbers and what they can be used for , the concept of negative numbers is indeed strange .
We all go through this process at school , when we graduate from counting apples to doing more abstract mathematics involving subtractions .
We are often introduced to negative numbers via the concept of the number line .
This makes it seem a bit more natural that there are " more numbers " over there , on the left side of the normal counting numbers .
And we discover that negative numbers are useful for things like accounting , and keeping track of debts , and so on .
By the time most of us leave school , we are familiar and comfortable with the concept of negative numbers .
This is not the only example of finding " more numbers " that we were n't previously aware of .
Another thing we learn early in our school lives is fractions .
When we divide three apples between two people , how many apples does each person get ?
The answer cannot be found in the realm of the counting numbers .
We have to extend our knowledge of numbers to include rational numbers : all the possible results of dividing one integer by another .
And there are natural places on the good old number line for these too .
One and a half ( the answer to how many apples each person gets ) , sits halfway between 1 and 2 on the line .
So we 've filled in more spaces on our number line .
But wait , there 's more .
During high school algebra we learn about square roots .
And if we have a decent mathematics teacher , we manage to prove and understand that there are some numbers for which the square root is not a rational number .
The square root of 2 is the classic example .
We can even construct a line interval , geometrically , that has a length equal to the square root of 2 ( compared to a reference interval of length 1 ) .
So this number must exist somewhere on our number line , but not at a point that can be described as the ratio of two integers .
In other words , there are still gaps on our number line , in between all those rational numbers .
So we fill in the gaps with these extra numbers .
And then we get on to logarithms and trigonometry , and we discover there are still gaps in the number line , between these immensely densely packed numbers we already know about .
We learn about transcendental numbers , the best known examples of which are π and e .
More numbers .
But wait ... you guessed it .
There are still gaps in the numbers .
We can construct very simple statements like ∃a : a×a +1=0 ( there is a number a which has the property that when multiplied by itself , the answer can be added to 1 to give zero ; i.e. a multiplied by itself is - 1 ) that still look false in the numbers we know so far .
This is where things get tricky , and for one simple reason .
We can easily conceive of some more numbers , unlike any of the numbers we know , that have different properties to them , and which satisfy statements like this .
After all , we 've done it before , many times over .
We discovered negative numbers , and how useful they were , and we became familiar with them so they no longer seem strange .
We found rational numbers and recognised their utility , so they are like old friends now .
If we did well at high school mathematics , we learnt of more missing numbers , the irrationals and transcendentals , and we realised how useful they were , and accepted them into our ever - growing collection of things we regard as numbers .
The problem is that this latest enhancement to the realm of numbers was discovered in the 16th century , at a time when mathematical theory had become partially formalised .
Again , these new numbers were controversial , just as negative numbers , rational numbers , and irrational numbers were before them when they were discovered .
They were so controversial , in fact , that many prominent mathematicians refused to believe that such numbers could exist .
Thus these new numbers were given the rather unfortunate name of imaginary numbers .
And this is where the minds of many people learning mathematics today rebels .
" Well , " we reason , " if they 're imaginary , then they must n't really exist .
It 's some sort of trickery that does n't really mean anything , really . "
But this impression is wrong .
After all , does a negative number " really exist " ?
Show me - 3 apples .
Yet we use negative numbers all the time , with nary a second thought .
Why should numbers , which when multiplied by themselves , produce negative numbers , be any less real or useful ?
In fact , the imaginary numbers are incredibly useful .
But where are they on the number line ?
Actually , they 're at right angles to it .
Seriously .
If the normal number line runs from left to right , the imaginary numbers run in a line running up and down from the zero point .
How cool is that ?
And we 're still not done .
If we can enhance our number line with another line running up and down , what about all the other space above and below ?
Sure , there are numbers there too .
They 're called complex numbers .
But are these new numbers really useful ?
Sure , I can't show you the square root of minus one apples , but then neither can I show you - 3 apples .
The number - 3 is incredibly useful for accounting .
The square root of minus one is incredibly useful for work in fields as diverse as electronics , audio and video signal processing , power engineering , quantum mechanics , relativity , geology , seismology , materials stress analysis , fluid dynamics , system control theory , and so on .
Some of these names are a little abstract , but they encompass the theories of operation of things including computers , aeroplanes , space probes , earthquake analysis and prediction , submarines , and even industrial sewing machines .
( The physical properties of fabric and how it deforms under the stress of being sewed are most effectively characterised by using complex number theory . )
The imaginary and complex numbers are not some bizarre thing that a bored mathematician " made up " some day , that are only of interest to abstruse theoretical mathematicians .
They are respectable , important , and , for want of a better word , real numbers with real world applications .
Most people will never need to use them , but most people never need to use irrational numbers either .
But they exist , and it's a good thing they do .
~ ( " not " ) :
This symbol means that the statement that follows is not true , i.e. it is false .
∀a ∃b : a + b = 0 ( for every number , there is another number that when added to it gives 0 )
~∀a ∃b : a + b = 0 ( it is not the case that for every number , there is another number that when added to it gives 0 )
Back to Gödel .
One final enhancement to our developing number theory is this :
Now we can write statements like this :
The second statement is simply the reverse of the first .
If we consider only non-negative integers , the first statement is false , which means necessarily that the second is true .
If we do allow negative integers , the first statement is true , and the second necessarily false .
Now we 're in a position where we can express the negation of a false statement , which will then be a true statement .
So if we can't prove something like ∀a:a+a=0 ( because it 's actually false ) , we should be able to prove that it 's false by proving that ~∀a :a+a=0 is true .
So we now have a mechanism for proving that some statement is false : we add the " not " symbol in front and then prove that the resulting statement is true .
This step brings us firmly out of the realm of trivial theories of numbers and into the realm where things are decidedly non-trivial .
This pretty much completes our formal theory of numbers .
I have glossed past the actual symbol manipulation rules that we use to generate our proofs , but I assure you they exist , and the resulting theory is indeed very powerful , in that it can generate a proof for many non-trivial statements about numbers , such as :
∃a ∃b ∃c : a×a + b×b = c×c ( there are integers that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem )
The other important thing about this theory is that it does notgenerate a " proof " of a false statement about numbers .
This is important .
If it could generate proofs of false statements , then it would n't be much use .
This property of the formal theory is called
Right .
Now we know what a " consistent , non-trivial , formal , computably enumerable theory that proves basic arithmetical truths " is .
That 's the type of thing that Gödel 's theorem talks about .
What it says about it is : " an arithmetical statement that is true , but not provable in the theory , can be constructed . "
Whoa .
What does that mean ?
It means that there is some true statement about numbers that the formal theory cannot produce a proof for .
Let 's call that statement G as shorthand .
Gödel 's theorem says that G is true , but can not be proven .
And since we know that the theory can never produce a proof of a false statement , we can't prove ~G either .
In fact , within the formal system , we can never decide if G is true or not .
What 's more , Gödel 's theorem does n't just assert that G exists .
It also says we can construct the statement G . In fact , the proof of Gödel 's theorem explicitly constructs the statement G ( * ) .
This is a little mind - bending .
We can construct a statement that we know is true , but we cannot prove it is true ?
The catch lies in the fact that we cannot prove it is true within the formal theory .
To construct the statement G we have to use knowledge and rules about mathematics that lie outside the formal theory .
We 're allowed to do this .
[* No , this annotation will not provide an actual proof of Gödel 's theorem .
That would require an entire book , not just this annotation .
If you 're interested in learning how Gödel 's theorem is actually proved , I highly recommend the book Gödel , Escher , Bach , by Douglas Hofstadter . ]
But what it implies is that the formal system cannot prove everything about numbers that we can prove by thinking outside the formal system .
The kick in the pants is that this applies to all possible formulations of mathematics .
Because no matter how you extend or enhance your formal theory to try to account for the stuff you could n't prove before , Gödel 's theorem applies all over again to the new system , and shows that there is another mathematical truth that you can't prove .
And you can step this out as many levels as you like - you will never , ever , reach a theory of mathematics that is capable of proving everything that is actually true .
In other words , there are , incontrovertibly , some statements about the properties of numbers , that are true , but that we can not ever prove to be true .
That 's quite a stunning thing to think about .
But Gödel 's result does n't only apply to this rather abstract sort of mathematics .
Computers are formal systems .
Think about it .
Computers manipulate symbols .
That 's all they do .
They have no understanding of what they 're doing .
And they manipulate symbols according to strict rules laid down by their builders and programmers .
The rules can be very complex , but they are strict , formal rules .
Gödel 's theorem means that there are some things that are true , but that computers can never work out for us .
( For those familiar with computer science , this is intimately related to the famous halting problem .
For those unfamiliar with this , this is a specific well - known example of a problem that we know no computer can ever solve . )
Some philosophers have gone further , and applied Gödel 's theorem to the human mind .
The mind , they argue , at its most fundamental level merely manipulates symbols , according to some strict rules programmed by biochemistry .
We can no more break these rules than we can effectively decide to block certain chemicals reaching certain neurons in our brain .
If this is the case , then Gödel 's theorem implies that there are truths about the universe that we , human beings , can never prove .
Other philosophers have dismissed this argument as a load of bollocks , pointing out that Gödel 's theorem applies only to consistent formal systems , and the human mind is anything but consistent - we can readily convince ourselves of the truth of something that is in fact false .
Phew .
I hope those of you who have persisted this far got something out of all that .
I 'll leave you with a small reward :
Gödel 's incompleteness theorem would make a snazzy T - shirt design .
" Formulations of number theory : Complete , Consistent , Non-trivial .
Choose two . "
It looks like nobody 's made that T - shirt .
At least I could n't find any on the net .
In fact , searching for the sentence " Formulations of number theory : Complete , Consistent , Non-trivial .
Choose two . " reveals that it only appears on a handful of web pages , and this comic page is the earliest of them .
So it looks like I invented this sentence ?
Cool .
I should make that T - shirt and stick it on CafePress or something .
By the way , I 'm not sure how obvious the joke in the comic is .
It 's a comment on the fact that you can know something is true , and try to add it to Wikipedia , but other Wikipedia editors will question you on it and ask for citations .
And even if it 's true , and you know for an absolute fact that it 's true , if you can't provide a citation , then you can't prove within Wikipedia 's formal system that it 's true .
This often bites with cultural things .
There are things that Australians do , which I know for a fact because I see people do them all the time , and I do them myself , and which are so common and obvious to Australians that nobody has ever bothered writing a newspaper article or blog post or anything about them .
And thus , with no formal citations available , it 's impossible to convince European or American Wikipedia editors that it actually happens .
This is not really a criticism of Wikipedia ; more just a comment .

Already people are seeing the amount of bandwidth they can use limited by monthly caps and , in the US , operators have just won the right to charge more for bandwidth - hungry services .
With next - generation networks likely to cost billions to roll out , the issue of how operators will make money from them becomes even more pertinent .
Network operators in the US , and increasingly also in the UK , believe that rather than pass all of the costs on to the end user , content providers should also put their hands in their pockets in order to guarantee the best delivery of their services .
But others feel that allowing operators to prioritise certain traffic over other is fundamentally at odds with the free principles of the net which has allowed companies to flourish from very humble beginnings .
Pipe - dreams ?
PlusNet offers a service tailored to gamers
" It could be time for a new pricing model , " said Simon Gunter , head of strategy at UK ISP Tiscali .
He added : " We have to handle much more video and the question is - how do we square the costs of distributing lots of content ?
We could look to minimise the costs of distribution and in that the content originators may need to contribute . "
Already some operators offer tailored packages .
For example , UK internet service provider PlusNet offers a broadband package aimed just at gamers .
" It offers a better performance .
Gamers are assured of a faster gaming service , " said Neil Laycock , chief executive of PlusNet .
Going forward he expects more and more consumers to demand a certain quality of service from specific applications such as broadband telephony .
" Net neutrality is an issue no ISP can escape .
We 're convinced that demand for bandwidth driven by innovative applications will always outstrip the physical and economic supply of network , " he said .
" For that reason , net neutrality is a pipe - dream .
We believe it is vital to put the customer in control of what takes priority on their line and we 're already developing that capability , " he said .
Quality of service
The debate to maintain a neutral net has been raging most vehemently across the pond where competition between cable and rival operators is fierce .
In the US network providers such as Verizon and AT&T have effectively already won the right to prioritise the traffic of certain content providers , a power that has horrified net activists .
" The problem with the system in the US is that in order to guarantee one player 's content it is prioritised over someone else 's " explained Antony Walker , head of the UK's Broadband Stakeholder 's Group .
" That is moving away from the basic model of the net that created innovators such as MySpace and YouTube on the basis that all bits of content were equal , " he said .
Competition
Could the US learn lessons from the UK broadband market ?
The issue in the US is being fought by organisations such as the Open Internet Coalition .
Companies with a huge net presence such as Google and Microsoft have also joined the campaign .
The Open Internet Coalition says some companies are employing network management tools to deliberately block file - sharing traffic , irrespective of what files are being shared .
It also accuses companies of blocking content that they feel is too political in nature or is in someway derogatory to them .
For companies such as Operax , which offers the network management tools that allow operators to prioritise traffic , the issue is being blown out of proportion .
" The major arguers for net neutrality say that access to the network will be locked down for commercial advantage but I think that is a myth .
There is no evil plan and everyone recognises that a competitive net is a key driver , " said Chris Merrick , chief marketing officer with Operax .
The prices that companies such as Verizon - which is investing $ 18bn in a fibre network to reach huge swathes of the US - are paying to connect people need to be recouped somehow , he argues .
" What people are saying is ' Let 's have quality of service for specific services such as voice - over IP and IPTV .
Let 's allocate resources to make sure they work effectively while still guaranteeing access to the free - for - all internet . ' , " he said .
Many believe the debate is unlikely to become quite so heated in the UK as it has in the US , largely down to the fact that the UK has a far more competitive market .
" Essentially the issue of net neutrality is about competition .
In the US the broadband market operates like a duopoly , " said Antony Walker .
Pricier services ?
The regulatory landscape in the UK is such that there is far more competition with 60 % of homes having a choice of at least four broadband providers .
And Ofcom forces BT to act with so - called " equivalence " so that any services it offers to consumers must also be offered in a wholesale version .
It is a system that the US is looking closely at .
One thing which most commentators agree on is that the cost of rolling out next - generation broadband is unlikely to be passed on to the consumer .
" The question is not whether you can charge more but rather whether you will even be able to charge what you charge today , " said Ian Fogg , an analyst with research firm Jupiter .
And whether consumers are going to be accept their content in a series of differently tailored packages is also open to debate , he thinks .
" People are used to the concept that when they pay for broadband they are paying for access to the whole internet , with a choice of websites .
Packaging it is going against what the internet is about , " he said .
Acadia National Park – Photo taken by beforethecoffee
TheGardenLady received this question from Clive :
I am a UK citizen and live in England .
Recently I purchased some waterfront land looking out towards Acadia National Park , in Down - East Maine .
In the next year I hope to have an all - year - round house built on the land , which I hope to visit a few times each year .
For the most part the land is wooded with some cleared areas going down to the tidal beach , with a deepish gulley as the boundary to one side of the land going down to the water .
I am keen to find about any plants that I could introduce .
I intend to keep the land ( apart from a small grass - mowed area around the house ) in a ‘ wild ’ state for the benefit of the plants and wild - life .
Can you suggest any plants / shrubs / trees etc. , that I might consider planting – given the fact that they will not be tended ?
The total area of land is about 7 acres .
Any help that you can give would be much appreciated .
Congratulations on getting a summer home in one of the prettiest states in the US and wanting to garden there .
As a Brit .
I feel certain that you will create a showplace .
My suggestion would be to plant plants native to Maine .
Of course , you can plant other , non-native plants , but this column will support planting native plants .
Whenever you move to an area , the first suggestion is to walk around the area to see what locals have in their gardens and to visit gardens of the area .
A website that gives public garden sites in all areas of Maine is this .
Then when you see plants that you like and that you think will grow in your garden , check out the native plant nurseries in your area .
An excellent site for nurseries is here .
However , the date of the publication is 2002 .
You should consider planting a garden to encourage native animals .
See here .
I know that England is not happy with our native grey squirrel taking over .
And you might become unhappy with the deer population in this country .
As much damage as the deer do in my garden , I must admit that TheGardenLady still gets a thrill when she sees these magnificent animals – or any animal - in her garden .
Be careful when planting to check out the list of plants that are invasive or becoming invasive .
Read this about invasive plants .
However , consider planting plants that are becoming rare in Maine to help restore disappearing flora and with these plants you will be helping the native fauna .
A great site that gives native plants of every state in the US , including Maine , is this .
And finally , your best resource which is free is to use is your Master Gardeners – the extension service that will answer any of your gardening questions .
If the telephone number on this page is not for the MG office nearest you , they will tell you where to call .
TheGardenLady and her readers would love to see photos ( with the names of the plants ) of the garden you create .

Why We Fight
By : Bernard Chazelle
I try not to make it a habit to quote David Brooks but sometimes his wisdom is too un-unquotable to resist .
He explains to us why we ain't leaving Iraq any time soon .
He is 100 % correct .
He prioritizes the reasons as follows :
There would be private but powerful opposition from Arab leaders ...
There would be irate opposition from important sections of the military ...
There would be important criticism from nonpartisan military experts .
Not to mention the pizza deliverers who cater for think tanks ( I hate it when Times columnists forget pizza deliverers .
Unintentional ?
Yeah , right ... )
Look Brooks , I understand as well as the next guy that the No1 reason we 're there is to please Arab dictators .
Fine .
I get it .
Then we need to please the generals .
You 've heard the expression " going postal . "
Well , when generals have no wars to fight , they " go general " and that 's ugly .
Then , of course , we need to satisfy the needs of the experts who advise the generals before they go general .
( And then the pizza deliverers ... )
Brooks should take his logic to the next step .
We need drunk drivers to serve the needs of ER doctors .
We need criminals to give lawyers something to do .
We need children to satisfy pedophiles and women to keep rapists in business .
We need large urban centers to make Shock & Awe possible .
We need the New York Times to showcase the twisted minds of its columnists .

In a case now pending in a federal court in Brooklyn , Mamie Manneh of Staten Island stands accused of having brought smoked bushmeat – known colloquially as monkey meat – into the United States without proper permits , in violation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species .
Ms. Manneh ’s defense is that in her religion the eating of bushmeat has both a cultural and a spiritual significance .
In an affidavit , 17 of her co-religionists declared , “ We eat bushmeat for our souls . ”
Manneh ’s lawyer , Jan Rostal , has analogized the African - based practice to the consumption at a Passover seder of foods like bitter herbs “ that might have some reference to the Exodus . ”
In a motion to dismiss , Rostal said that the case , while apparently novel , “ represents the sort of clash of cultural and religious values inherent in the melting pot that is America . ”
No , it does n’t .
It represents a more fundamental clash : between the imperatives of religion and the rule of law .
The question raised by the case is whether the fact of a religious belief is sufficient to exempt the believer from the application of generally applicable laws — laws ( like driving on the right - hand side of the road ) that apply to every citizen no matter what his or her religious , ethical or moral convictions .
Is religious belief a special case , so special that the devout practitioner gets a pass ?
John Locke posed that question in “ A Letter Concerning Toleration ” ( 1689 ) , and his analysis of it remains relevant today .
Locke asks if it is lawful for Meliboeus ( a name borrowed from pastoral poetry ) to slaughter a calf and offer it as a sacrifice at a religious meeting .
It depends , he says , on whether slaughtering a calf in order to put food on his family ’s table is lawful .
If it is , then killing the calf for ritual purposes is perfectly allowable , for “ what may be spent on a feast may be spent on a sacrifice . ”
But the logic also holds in the opposite direction .
Suppose , Locke imagines , a disease had destroyed a large number of cattle and the government decreed that no more could be slaughtered .
The prohibition would surely extend to religious rituals , not as a specific target of state action , but as a practice swept up in the wake of a general law .
That law , Locke observes , would not be “ made about a religious matter , but about a political matter . ”
It would be true that some people would no longer be able to engage in behavior they considered central to their religious life , but because that would not be the result aimed at — the good of the commonwealth would be the concern — the government could not be accused of contriving to harm religion , even if that were an unintended consequence of its action .
Nor would it be wise to exempt persons of certain beliefs from the general prohibition ; for that would amount to bending the law to the preferences and desires of particular citizens , and once you begin to do that there is no logical place to stop and the rule of law would be destroyed .
The upshot of Locke ’s argument is that religious practices flourish only at the sufferance of the state .
In theory you have the right to worship in the manner dictated by your faith , but should an aspect of that worship run up against a duly enacted regulation , the regulation , provided it is neutral in intention , trumps the demands of worship .
This same line of reasoning can be found in religion clause cases stretching from Reynolds v. United States ( 1878 ) to Employment Division v. Smith ( 1990 ) .
( There is an alternative tradition of “ accommodating ” religion in cases like Sherbert v. Verner and Wisconsin v. Yoder . )
In Reynolds the court considered the argument made by a man convicted of practicing polygamy that it is the religious duty of male members of the Mormon Church to engage in plural marriage , and that the penalty for failing to do so “ would be damnation in the life to come . ”
The court observed that the prohibition against polygamy was general and not directed at any sect , and asked , “ can a man excuse ” his illegal practice of an interdicted behavior just “ because of his religious belief ? ”
The answer is swift , firm and Lockean .
“ To permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land , and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself . ”
In such a circumstance , the court concluded , “ government could exist only in name . ”
The same logic rules in Smith .
Here the issue was the ingestion at a Native American religious ceremony of peyote , deemed a “ controlled substance ” by the laws of Oregon .
Justice Antonin Scalia , writing for the majority , notes that the Native American celebrants “ contend that their religious motivation for using peyote places them beyond the reach of a criminal law that is not specifically directed at their religious practice and that is concededly constitutional as applied to those who use the drug for other reasons . ”
In short , the demand is that the law be applied differently to persons with different beliefs — you ca n’t use peyote as a recreational drug , but I can use it because I consider it sacramental — and this Scalia refuses to do .
The intention of the Oregon law , he points out , was not to curtail anyone ’s free exercise of religion , and the fact that the free exercise rights of some people happened to be impacted negatively is “ merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid principle . ”
If the affected believers are unhappy , Scalia concludes , let them turn to the “ political process ” and try to get laws passed that will address their concerns .
That is exactly what happened on two fronts .
Congress passed a law making the use of peyote in religious ceremonies an exception to the controlled substances regulations .
And the same Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( 1993 ) , which transferred the burden of proof from the religious practitioner to the government .
Where the assumption in Reynolds and Smith is that the state need only be innocent of the intention to impede free exercise , the distinction between intentional effects and what Scalia calls “ incidental ” effects is RFRA ’s first casualty : “ Laws ‘ neutral ’ toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise . ”
Whatever the source and pedigree of the burden , whether it is designed or accidental , those who suffer it must have a legal recourse .
Accordingly , in any instance where the burden is “ substantial , ” the state must demonstrate that the law in question “ ( 1 ) is in furtherance of a compelling government interest ; and ( 2 ) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest . ”
In other words , the fact of a law duly passed by the appropriate bodies is not enough ; with respect to a particular class of persons – religious believers – that law cannot take effect unless it can be shown that the highest state considerations require that it be applied without exception .
While RFRA was hailed as a victory for religious freedom by many , others saw in it the realization of the fear expressed by the Reynolds and Smith courts , the fear that any law could be lawfully disobeyed by someone who asserted that it interfered with the free exercise of his or her religion .
In effect , they complained , the rule of law was being subordinated to the private convictions of an ever expanding set of citizens .
For , as Scalia observes in Smith , who can tell another that a certain practice is not central to the free exercise of his religion ?
Prison inmates can claim that their religious requires them to eat porterhouse steak every day .
And Meliboeus must be allowed to slaughter his calf even when his non-religious neighbors are prevented from doing so .
This brings us back to Mamie Manneh and monkey - meat .
How will she fare in the courts ?
Her attorney is mounting an RFRA defense , but the act was weakened in City of Boerne v. Flores ( 1997 ) , when Justice Kennedy challenged Congress ’s ability to pass it .
Congress , he said , has the power to enforce rights , not to create them : “ Legislation which alters the Free Exercise Clauses ’s meaning ” – by creating a special right of exemption from general laws – “ cannot be said to be enforcing the clause . ”
Moreover , said Kennedy , “ if Congress could define its own power by altering the Fourteenth Amendment ’s meaning , no longer would the Constitution be ‘ superior , paramount law , unchangeable by ordinary means . ’”
In short , saying what the Constitution means is our job , not yours .
That might have seemed the end of it , but in a 2006 case ( Gonzales v. O Centro ) , the Roberts court interpreted Boerne as invalidating only the application of RFRA to the states .
Given that Ms. Manneh ’s case is being adjudicated in a federal court , an RFRA defense is at least plausible , although the fact that bushmeat is associated with diseases like ebola will likely be enough to satisfy even the “ compelling interest ” test and give the government a victory .
But no matter how the case turns out , we can be sure of one thing : it wo n’t be the last , because the issues Locke identified and analyzed will never be resolved .
In her dissent in Boerne , Justice O’Connor wrote , “ Our Nation ’s Founders conceived of a Republic receptive to voluntary religious expression , not a secular society in which religious expression is tolerated only when it does not conflict with generally applicable law . ”
Yes , that ’s the question .
Do we begin by assuming the special status of religious expression and reason from there ?
Or do we begin with the rule of law and look with suspicion on any claim to be exempt for it , even if the claim is made in the name of apparently benign religious motives ?
From Reynolds to the present moment , everyone has had an answer to that question , but I predict that no one will ever have the last word .
Make no mistake , there are plenty of outfits out there looking to snap up your loose change in exchange for a pre-built rollup keyboard , but if you just can't stand that ' board that came bundled in with your last pre-fab PC , we think there 's a better alternative .
Apparently , all you have to do is remove the inner membrane from an unwanted set of keys , make sure the control board is accurately reassembled onto said membrane and cut out letters in the font of your choosing to keep you on track when your touch typing skills begin to fade .

Money is not the key to happiness Conservative leader David Cameron says there is more to life than making money , arguing that improving people 's happiness is a key challenge for politicians .
The science of happiness poses huge questions for politicians .
Governments have succeeded in delivering greater and greater wealth but that has not translated into extra happiness .
Now research is suggesting ways in which societies might try to maximise well - being - ideas which often challenge some of the basic principles of modern life .
Increasingly , politicians from all sides are taking notice of the findings and discussing how they might capture the elusive feel - good factor .
Back in 1999 , Tony Blair wrote about achieving " a better quality of life " , adding : " Money is n't everything .
But in the past governments have seemed to forget this .
We should be thinking not just what is good for putting money in people 's pockets but what is good for putting joy in people 's hearts
Conservative leader David Cameron
" Success has been measured by economic growth - GDP - alone .
" Delivering the best possible quality of life for us all means more than concentrating solely on economic growth .
" That is why sustainable development is such an important part of this Government 's programme .
" All this depends on devising new ways of assessing how we are doing . "
The leader of the Conservative Party , David Cameron told The Happiness Formula programme : " We should be thinking not just what is good for putting money in people 's pockets but what is good for putting joy in people 's hearts .
" When politicians are looking at issues they should be saying to themselves ' how are we going to try and make sure that we do n't just make people better off but we make people happier , we make communities more stable , we make society more cohesive ' . "
Economics
The idea that politics should be about creating " the greatest happiness of the greatest number " goes back to the end of the 18th century and the philosopher Jeremy Bentham .
Jeremy Bentham 's body was preserved after his death in 1832 However , no - one could work out how to measure happiness , or how to weigh one person 's happiness against how other people feel .
So economics , which is built on objective measurement , took hold instead .
In the past few years figures close to government in Britain have been arguing once again that policies should take account of how happy - or unhappy - they make people .
In 2002 , The Prime Minister 's Strategy Unit held a " life satisfaction " seminar in Whitehall discussing the implications of a " happiness " policy .
A few month 's later , Downing Street published an " analytical paper " which considered how happiness might affect different policies including : A happiness index Teaching people about happiness
More support for volunteering " A more leisured work - life balance " Higher taxes for the rich
The authors were careful to say that the ideas were not government policy , but Tony Blair 's policy adviser who helped write the paper , David Halpern , told The Happiness Formula it is inevitable that in future governments will be judged on their success in making people happy .
" Put it this way , if government does n't measure it , other people will and already are . "
Already one government department has defined its purpose as improving people 's " health and happiness " .
The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs is working on a happiness index .
Furthermore , every local authority in England and Wales has wide - ranging powers to promote well - being .
The Happiness Formula has been looking at how different politics would be if government tried to make people happy rather than just rich .
Tax makes you happy Research has suggested that one of the key reasons why wealth has not translated into happiness is that we tend to compare ourselves with people who are richer than we are .
At a certain level , taxes are likely to increase the well - being of the population
The Prime Minister 's adviser David Halpern
As a result , even though we may be better off ourselves , we still do not get any happier .
If we want a happier society , so the theory goes , we need to reduce the gap between rich and poor .
And the way to do that is to redistribute wealth from the rich to the less well - off .
So some close to government are now arguing that , believe it or not , taxes make us happy .
" We tend to think of taxes as bad , " said the PM 's adviser David Halpern .
" I know it 's difficult for us to believe as we take out our chequebook at the end of the year , but it looks like , at least at a certain level , taxes are likely to increase the well - being of the population . "
The leading economist Professor Richard Layard of the LSE explains why : " We should try and discourage people from comparing themselves with other people ... and I think the tax system can help us in that way . "
Do not panic though - both Mr Halpern and Professor Layard reckon the current tax rates are about right for maximising happiness .
Banning advertising
The science of happiness suggests advertising is a major cause of unhappiness because it makes people feel less well - off .
Is advertising damaging our sense of well - being ?
According to Professor Layard some advertising should be banned .
" I do n't see that we need to allow pictorial advertising which conveys very little information because it makes people feel poorer . "
In the remote Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan , where government makes policy on the basis of Gross National Happiness , most street advertising is banned - particularly when aimed at children .
In the UK , the National Consumer Council is campaigning to ban advertising to children below the age of 10 .
" We already regulate alcohol to children , we should also regulate and I think ban advertising of junk food to children , " said Ed Mayo , Chief Executive of the NCC .
" There is no case , in terms of health or wellbeing of children for advertising like this . "
In fact , says Mr Mayo , the council 's own research suggests advertising to children can make them more unhappy .
" Children that are more brand aware , are more consumerist , came across as less satisfied in other parts of their lives - were unhappier " .
Commuting less According to scientists commuting is really bad news for happiness .
Commuting eats at your happiness
Not only is the journey to and from work often a pretty miserable experience in itself , it has knock - on effects which limit the happiness of the rest of our lives .
It appears that our happiness is closely linked to what researchers call our " social capital " - the sum of all our connections and trust in other people , our personal family ties , our friends , and our acquaintances .
Professor Robert Putnam of Harvard University has calculated that every 10 minutes of commuting cuts all forms of social involvement by 10 % - so 10 % fewer family dinners , local club meetings , and other involvement .
Once politicians encouraged us to " get on our bikes " and look for work .
But the science of happiness suggests we might be better off staying close to our families and friends .
There are implications for whether government should support communities where traditional industries have failed .
Questions , too , for business and individuals as to whether they should move to new areas .
It is arguable that planners and politicians should try to discourage people from living far from where they work .
Encourage marriage
The science of happiness suggests marriage is so good for your well - being that it adds an average seven years to the life of a man and something like four for a woman .
To maximise happiness , it is argued , government should certainly do nothing to discourage marriage ; arguably it should promote it .
However , in Britain , any financial incentives to get married have been taken away .
Politicians seem reluctant to make moral judgments about domestic relationships .
" The married tend to be happier , " said Mr Halpern .
" In my view , it 's not so much necessarily for government to say you therefore should be married , but it 's perfectly reasonable [ for the government ] to say ... if you do these you 'll probably be happy , if you do these you 'll probably be miserable , you decide . "
Rethinking the health service Research also suggests there is a powerful link between happiness and health .
Being happy may benefit your health more than exercise
It is suggested that making people happy could do more for the health of the nation than all the exercise , diet and anti-smoking campaigns rolled into one .
And that argues for a big re-think in the priorities of the NHS .
Policies aimed at making people happier - or at least less unhappy - should be encouraged in an effort to prevent people becoming ill in the first place .
One idea is to massively increase access to a relatively new form of psychotherapy called CBT or cognitive behavioural therapy , which aims to help people avoid dwelling on negative thoughts and find ways to overcome them .
Lord Layard , author of Happiness : lessons from a new science , believes the science is so conclusive the government should immediately employ another 10,000 therapists .
" We 're talking about for a course of CBT a thousand , £ 1500 with something that can change somebody 's life .
" It really is important that we should try and have a major nationally organised training programme for more therapists . "
Making people happy
But just how far should a government go ?
In Bhutan they have banned a whole series of TV channels such as wrestling and MTV .
The country has even banned plastic bags .
One reason Bhutan has been able to take such dramatic steps is that it is run by an absolute monarchy .
In the West , if politicians , acting in the name of happiness , were to impose bans and restrictions on people 's freedom , governments would be more likely to encounter resistance .
Some argue that the logic of happiness research would be the ultimate in nanny states - an argument the Prime Minister 's strategy adviser is keen to contradict .
" I 'm sure lots of ministers would be nervous about that .
" But it turns out that some of the key determinates of what make us happy , are things over which we as individuals have relatively little control about prevalent levels of community safety , they 're safe when they go out .
" How do other people in general behave , about the way in which our whole economy may be locked into a given path .
" These are things that as individuals we can't determine , but we can determine as a society together , and that basically means government is in the game . "

Hastert said he did so on the advice of attorneys with the aim that a special primary election to replace him could be held on Feb .
5 --- the same day as the state 's regular primary election , which will decide nominees for Hastert 's long - term replacement as well .
Hastert said he wanted to avoid the extra costs of a special primary election by county election officials in the 14th Congressional District , which runs from western DuPage County to nearly the Iowa border .
Still , those counties are likely to face extra costs for holding a special general election in late spring to fill the remainder of Hastert 's term .
The former speaker said he also decided to step down now because his interests in developing new national energy policies was being sidetracked in the Democratic - controlled Congress , which is focused on the presidential election campaign .
" I wanted to get some energy policy done , but everything is being done behind closed doors on a partisan basis , " Hastert told the Tribune .
" You know , it seems to get tougher as we move into a presidential election year , and so I figured it was time for me to go out and live the rest of my life . "
It 's up to Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich to set the date of the special primary and general elections .
Dan White , executive director of the State Board of Elections , said he had yet to receive notice of Hastert 's resignation .
White did , however , outline the process for replacing a congressman who resigns mid-term : the governor calls for an election within 120 days of the vacancy .
White said his reading of the law is that a primary and general election would have to take place within the 120 - day period .
Local officials would need to see how quickly that could be done given they would have to given proper notice of elections , White said .
The board acts mostly in a ministerial role , receiving the filing , but the duty and responsibility of running the elections would fall to the various local officials in his district , White said .
In his farewell speech , Hastert told his House colleagues earlier this month that he would step down from his seat before year 's end .
Hastert said he had no immediate career plans , but said he expects to devote time to the creation of the Hastert Center for Economics , Government and Public Policy at Wheaton College , his alma mater .
The school also will house a special library collection of his congressional papers .
Hastert , the longest serving GOP
House speaker , said he had not explored job opportunities because of the potential for conflicts of interest while still a member of Congress .
" I 'm going to talk to some folks .
I may serve on some boards .
I really do n't know , " Hastert said .
But , he said , he had no plans to eventually lobby his former colleagues after what he said was a two - year ban on such activities by ex-House members .
Hastert also said he has not made a decision on whether to make an endorsement of a potential successor among the Republican field .
The former speaker has not been on good terms with one contender , state Sen.
Chris Lauzen of Aurora , who earned Hastert 's enmity by polling a potential congressional run in 2005 while Hastert was still speaker .
" If I do , it will be later on in December , " said Hastert , who previously backed another of his potential successors , Jim Oberweis , in a failed U.S. Senate bid .
OK , I ’ve figured out how to do a chart of the full data on CO2 emissions I referred to in an earlier post .
It ’s pretty scary :

No sudden , sharp boundary marks the passage of day into night in this gorgeous view of ocean and clouds over our fair planet Earth .
Instead , the shadow line or terminator is diffuse and shows the gradual transition to darkness we experience as twilight .
With the Sun illuminating the scene from the right , the cloud tops reflect gently reddened sunlight filtered through the dusty troposphere , the lowest layer of the planet 's nurturing atmosphere .
A clear high altitude layer , visible along the dayside 's upper edge , scatters blue sunlight and fades into the blackness of space .

The big lie that religious people tell one another is not that God exists .
That is the small lie .
Any claim which goes unsupported by evidence -- and moreover , does not even consider evidence ( except reports of " miracles " ) to be necessary -- can only be described as small , since it is insubstantial , no more than a hunch really .
Sure , this little lie about God can get elaborated into something solemn and serious enough to command the adherence of wonderful , well - meaning people all over the world ...
But it 's really just -- what shall we call it ? -- a goof , a conjecture , a stab in the dark .
We all know people who believe that it is " Our Father Who Art in Heaven " who exists ( some may be reading this post -- hello ! ) .
Others say it is Allah ; others Vishnu .
Others the Flying Spaghetti Monster ( a site I recommend , if for nothing else than for its impressive control of tone ) .
For the nonbeliever , these lies are perhaps amusing , sometimes engaging , sometimes even deadly , but little lies .
No more .
The big lie that religious people tell is that a world without God is a world without hope or meaning .
On the last day of November , Pope Benedict XVI issued an encyclical which parroted this lie .
The New York Times , true to form on the topic of atheism , then echoed this lie uncritically in an article entitled , " In Pope 's Latest Teaching , an Argument for Hope , Not Atheism , in the Face of Struggle . "
( For the internet edition the title was shortened to " Pope Stresses Hope in Latest Teaching . "
If I were an editor at the Times , simply as a matter of saving space , I would just go with " Pope Stresses " -- and lose the rest .
It works ! )
Here 's the letter which I wrote to the New York Times after seeing that article ( it went unpublished -- no surprise ) :
Re : " In Pope 's Latest Teaching , an Argument for Hope , Not Atheism , in the Face of Struggle , " December 1 , 2007 .
As an atheist , I recognize that , for many religious people , their faith brings them great hope for the future ( the " ocean of infinite love " that Pope Benedict XVI describes , as well as other rewards in this life ) .
I would only ask that religious people stop insisting that my outlook on life is correspondingly hopeless and meaningless .
On the contrary , my atheism gives me great hope ; it renews my commitment to creating , with others , a world filled with love , fairness , empathy , and other good things , since , in all likelihood , this is it folks !
Yes , we nonbelievers must avoid utopian dreams of forever changing the human condition ( e.g. the New Socialist Man or the Fourth Reich ) .
But a belief that this life is all we have has a marvelous way of concentrating the mind on the need to listen to , and work with , other people .
It gives you hope in humanity .
It gives you hope that together we can make of our lives something worthwhile and beautiful .
This is my plea :
Please , my dear religious fellow - citizens of this country and the world , please stop telling the rest of us that our lives have no meaning .
Our lives have meaning , I assure you .
And you are part of it .
Even you , Pope Benedict XVI .
Even you are part of the meaning of my family and my life .

Just as I ’m a sucker for darker areas of cinema ( like zombie movies , apocalyptic movies , and post apocalyptic movies ) , I ’m a sucker for a good anti-hero .
If I have a choice between an anti-hero and a regular hero , I ’ll take the anti-hero any day of the week because I think they are inherently more interesting characters than their truly noble counterparts .
The definition of an anti-hero as a character who performs acts that are generally deemed or thought to be heroic , but he / she will do so with methods , actions , manners , and intentions that are not so .
I also tend to add that there is a touch of darkness surrounding anti-heroes , a sense of danger that does n’t go away .
With that definition , who are the ten best to ever grace the cinema screen ?
10 . Erik Draven ( the Crow ) The Crow ( 1994 )
This is a modern classic .
Some people would argue that the crow is more of a hero , but there ’s tons of darkness around this character , more than a hint of insanity , and he will kill anyone who gets in between him and his revenge .
That ’s where the difference is .
If he just killed the murderers , fine , but he kills the whole gang , works his way up the chain , and kills anyone in collusion .
Just ?
Sure , but still an anti-hero .
Buy the DVD at Amazon
9 . “ Mad ” Max Rockatansky Mad Max & Sequels ( 1979 )
Mad Max is a great example of an anti-hero .
He walks away from being a cop to wage a war of vengeance , and as the world falls apart , he re-appears , always thinking about himself first , and willing to help survivors only if they had something to offer him .
By the third movie he ’s just a shell , who refuses to go with people who would care for him , love him , because he goes alone .
He only helps others when he has something to lose by not doing so , making Mad Max one of the most beloved anti-heroes of all time .

8. Snake Plissken
Escape from New York ( 1981 )
Snake Plissken is the epitome of a bad boy “ hero . ”
He is a convict , he hates the government , wants to drink and smoke , and does n’t give a crud about authority .
He is a bad guy , but mostly because his need to be self - serving contradicts with the government and authorities .
Put in situations to do good , he does , even if coerced , and he often seems to have more morals than the “ good guys ” that he ’s working for .
That being said , he does n’t do good for anyone unless he gets something out of it .
Snake has darkness all around him , and his “ me first ” attitude and ability to fight off ( or fit in with ) the worst scum make him a futuristic anti-hero .

7. Harry Callahan Dirty Harry ( 1971 )
“ Do I feel lucky ?
Well , do ya , punk ? ”
This is now one of the most famous lines in all of cinema .
Harry Callahan , nicknamed “ Dirty Harry , ” is known as a renegade cop who does n’t care about breaking the law ( specifically the rights of the criminal ) to get the job done .
Dirty Harry has a very clear sense of right , but he is a “ the ends justify the means ” type of guy , which keeps him in the doghouse and puts him on this list .

6. Tyler Durden Fight Club ( 1999 )
Tyler Durden is the modern anti-hero !
Anti-capitalism , anti-credit card , he ’s against being made into a zombie and he hates big brother .
This film delves into a modern society , always broken , always needing a fix .
He is the strong , independent , “ alive ” man that most men want to be , fighting against obvious wrongs we feel powerless against , but for no good moral reason , but because he can .
He does what he does because he wants to , and if some of us want to join a fight club and see him as heroic , that ’s just part of the ride .

5 . The Man With No Name / ” Blondie ” The Dollars Trilogy ( 1964 , 65 , 66 )
Clint Eastwood makes this list twice , but it ’s hard to beat his “ man with no name ” from the Westerns .
A man with a dark past , no future , and he knows how to kill and how to move on after killing .
He ’s not kind , but he is righteous .
He ’s a killer and he knows it , but he will only kill other killers .
He has no name because he has no future , but he has a true code of honor .
Not good , not bad , but honorable : the perfect anti-hero .

4. The MacManus Brothers ( Connor & Murphy ) The Boondock Saints ( 1999 )
Troy Duffy ’s cult classic follows two Irish brothers who are deeply devoted to their faith , yet fully accepting of the idea of being “ the vengeful hand of God . ”
These two brothers cuss like Quentin Tarantino , drink like a bad Irish joke , and shoot without remorse … but they will ONLY shoot bad guys .
They wo n’t even go after the FBI agent trying to nail them .
This story starts as self defense against a couple Russian thugs from the Russian mafia , and evolves following the brothers as they decide that doing nothing with evil all around is far worse a sin than killing evil men .
This study in vigilantism creates the brothers as great anti-heroes , even as they murder bad guy after bad guy , and the last scene , where a bad guy is executed in front of his family ( mom , wife , and all ) makes it clear that they may be likable , but as Agent Smecker says in the film “ They are not superheroes triumphing over evil . ”
But they are amazing anti-heroes .

3. D - Fens Falling Down ( 1993 )
This is a true cult classic .
Many people love this movie , or they hate it .
Michael Douglas plays the part of “ D - Fens , ” a normal man who has a terrible day during an unusually hot Los Angeles summer day .
He tries to get home to his daughter ’s birthday party , but is accosted time after time by a society that is n’t fair — and like many of us has thought about , he fights back , becoming a vigilante and getting increasingly violent as his sanity is obviously going out the window .
From an Asian grocer overcharging badly , to crap fast food that does n’t look like the picture , to two gang members trying to rob him , to a Neo - Nazi who breaks his snow globe …he faces the daily things that piss every person off , and even though he certainly is not “ good . ”
How he tries to fix what ’s broken is poetic , but by the end he ’s cracked and a killer , but one who is easy to sympathize with because he just got pushed too far .

2. Leon Leon : The Professional ( 1994 )
There have been few movies so beautifully woven , few characters like Leon , played by Jean Reno .
Leon is a professional assassin who lives in a shady part of New York City .
He lives next door to a 13 year old Matilda , who is part of a dysfunctional family .
When the family is killed by a corrupt DEA agent , Leon reluctantly agrees to take care of the young girl .
She asks questions that are unnerving , asking Leon to be her first lover ( thankfully he refuses ) and asking personal questions along that nature .
In the extended version there is a suggestion that there is more than a father daughter relationship , and while he “ protects ” her , he teaches her how to be a killer .
Leon never appears as a warm figure .
Even in a “ heroic suicide , ” he is still a murderer and without remorse , but it was in defense of another .

1. Travis Bickle Taxi Driver ( 1976 )
No matter what list you look at of top anti-heroes in movies , Robert De Niro ’s portrayal of a cab driver gone vigilante is right at the top of everyone ’s list .
This is especially amazing considering how many good anti-heroes are out there in movies , and there is wide disagreement on top ten lists , but Travis Bickle is a great example of how the darkness can seep in .
First off , we as the audience tend to sympathize with him , but his motives remain unknown throughout the film which makes it hard to stay with his actions , especially as it becomes clear that he ’s not completely all there , and then the assassination attempt of a political candidate seems straight out evil until he saves a child prostitute , but his head is so messed up you do n’t know why he ’s doing anything any more , making even heroic actions seem , well , really creepy .

こちら機関投資家向けの説明会資料なのだそうですが、これを読むと、急成長してきたブックオフもついに既存前年割れをおこしはじめており、ブックオフにもとうとう曲がり角が訪れたように見えます。
ブックオフというのは非常に面白いフランチャイザーで、この会社のことを研究すれば研究するほど、実に不思議な在り様に驚かされるのですが、たとえば不振店があったとしたら、その店舗のオーナーは本部に文句を言うのが普通のフランチャイズだと思います。ところが面白いことにブックオフではむしろ逆になります。不振店のオーナーに対して「あんたのところの店、売上がもうひとつやけど、ちゃんとわてらの言う通りやってまっか？出来てへんのとちゃいまっか？ちゃんとわかってへんから売上がいかへんのですわ。わてらが教えたるさかい、研修にきなはれ」という感じで研修を強力にすすめるのです。
で、その研修のメインは 「人間力向上！」の自己啓発セミナーだったりします。すごいことに人間力が向上するとブックオフでは売上があがってしまうのです（まじで）。ブックオフのフランチャイズの真髄は、実はこの教育システムで、ロイヤリティ3.5％のうち、3％はこの教育研修のノウハウに価値があるのだと個人的には分析しています。
もっとも 「人間、やる気をだしたやつが力あわせて売場つくれば売上は絶対にあがる」という、これまでブックオフを支えてきた精神論にもどうやら限界があったようです。この資料には、これまで放棄してきたMDに対する取組の重要性が指摘されていました。ブックオフも面陳コメントPOPとかが標準装備になっていくようですね。これからのブックオフがどう舵をきっていくのか、本当に目が離せなくなってきました。
ところで、原宿のブックオフが知らない間に閉店していました。家賃が月に１８５０万もしたんですか…。で、今度は渋谷に617坪で出店？？617坪って町田のやつよりもでかいですよ、すごいなぁ。この資料に出店時期は明記されてないですが、すでに契約も終わってるらしく、渋谷に一大リサイクルエリアが出現しそうな気配です。

Let 's say it straight out : Virtually every architect and supporter of today 's neo - con - game of endless war is a coward .
Why ?
Because anyone who advocates a policy of military invasion , yet studiously avoids joining the soldiers on the battlefield , is , by definition , a coward .
What kind of a person believes that a cause is worth ( someone else ) dying for , yet not only refuses to face the " enemy , " but remains , at all times , in the cool shadow of security ?
I 'll tell you what kind — a coward .
What kind of a person can't wait to send America 's youth to die in Iraq for a series of absurd , constantly evolving fabrications , yet finds it more prudent to receive lobbyists than to fire a rifle ?
I 'll tell you what kind — a raw coward .
We 've all heard the deranged platitudes : " Sorry I ca n't join ya over there … but I 'll be stayin ' here , representin ' ya , makin ' sure the homeland is secure , and that the economy stays on track .
Believe me , I 'm gonna be doin ' everything I can to keep you and your buddies well - supplied — with everything you need for victory .
So … God 's speed .
We 'll all be thinkin ' about ya .
And prayin ' for ya .
You 're all just fabulous ! "
Another classic : " I 've already served my country in the military .
I 've done my duty .
Now , someone else can do his .
I 'm entitled to voice my support for this war .
But , right now , I 'm just too old to return to battle !
And too busy with my job ! "
And my all - time favorite ?
" Well … I have n't really had any military training .
I think it 's best to leave the actual fighting to professionals . "
How much training does it take to blow a hole in an eight - year - old girl ?
So …soccer mom , construction worker , US Senator , software engineer , grade school teacher , Vice - President of the United States , young , old … whatever you are .
You think defeating worldwide " terrorism " is a life - or - death issue for America ?
Then put your courage where your mouth is .
Join - up , or shut - up .
Just look around .
And listen .
Listen to all of America 's neo-conned , warriors - in - theory .
Their numbers are legion .
They 're in Congress .
They 're in the White House .
They 're wearing the black robes of justice .
They 're walking the streets of America , safely preaching genocide .
What do they all have in common ?
There 's never a doubt , and never a scratch .
Cowards , each and every one .
I hereby issue a challenge : I challenge any supporter of our current Middle East blood fest to tell me exactly why he is still here — and not over there .
Do you hear a sudden eerie silence ?
Of course you do .
It 's the silence of cowards .
Have you noticed how the rationale for war these days is becoming less and less important ?
At this very moment , we are committing mass - extermination in Iraq — for no discernable reason whatsoever .
Except for one — profit .
When our nation 's very existence rests in the balance ( as the " War on Terror " drum - beaters repeatedly claim ) , precisely why is any kind of profit - taking permitted ?
Why is n't the military - industrial complex offering its materials and services at cost ?
This is a question the cowards would rather not answer , because answering it would reveal the truth :
If you take the profit out of war …there is no war .
Today 's cowardly patriotism resides only within the perimeter of profit — and safety .
And there 's also a corollary , just for cowards :
If you require those calling loudest for war to fire the first shot , the guns remain silent .
Our " War on Terror " has absolutely nothing to do with " terrorists . "
It has absolutely nothing to do with preventing another 9/11 .
( The proof ?
The neo - cowards ' refusal to secure our wide - open borders , due to their love affair with slave labor . )
It has nothing to do with a " Clash of Civilizations . "
It has everything to do with making money .
Lots and lots of money .
( And let 's never forget : There 's oil in them - thar hills ! )
And it has to do with a new type of " failure . "
Just as cowardice is now the new bravery , today , failure has also been rebranded .
It 's now called " success . "
The more American soldiers who die , the longer that innocent blood is spilled , the longer the cycle of destruction and rebuilding , in other words , the longer the horror — the bigger the profit .
A normal person believes that he is witnessing chaos in Iraq .
Not at all .
Success is everywhere in sight .
Of course , it 's a coward 's success .
And a coward 's profit .
With every gut - shot Iraqi child , limp in a grieving parent 's arms , we see a bullet that is sold .
And a profit that is made .
With every suffering , limbless soldier , the military - industrial complex sees a reason to persist .
And finds more profits to be made .
With every tank that 's ripped - apart , with every screaming , dying civilian , the White House imagines a " surge " that is working .
And sees a profit for a friend .
A government that endorses mass murder for profit , and calls it war , deserves no latitude .
It deserves a cage .
And so do we , if we stand by in passive assent .
Every American deserves what he tolerates .
The time for tolerance is over .
There 's only one candidate for President of the United States in 2008 who has the depth of understanding , and the character , necessary to place meaningful restraints upon our profit - centered system of cowardly warmongering — Ron Paul .
Positions of Dr. Paul's that would help achieve this objective include :
Getting rid of the Federal Reserve , which functions as the financial enabler of war , as well as its head - coach .
Forcing politicians in favor of war to make a formal declaration of war , as specified in the Constitution .
To which I would add :
Patriotism requires that the profit - motive be put - aside in time of war .
Therefore , financially profiting from a soldier 's courage , and , possibly , from the sacrifice of a soldier 's life , should be forbidden by law .
By law , every elected representative espousing war must either personally ship - off to battle , or , send a close family member in his stead .
The Ron Paul Revolution is , among other things , a revolution to reclaim our original American spirit , a spirit mangled , at least since the time of Lincoln , by the passive acceptance , and tacit encouragement , of state - sponsored mass - murder for profit .
With God 's help , it is a revolution that will come to pass .

Firefighters tell Florida Security Moms : Rudy hired ' unqualified yes men ' Nick Juliano
Published : Friday January 25 , 2008

Print This Email This
In a flier that will be landing in more than 100,000 Florida mailboxes before the state 's Republican primary , a firefighters ' union accuses foundering candidate Rudy Giuliani of excercising poor judgement and populating his New York administration with " unqualified yes men , " such as indicted former Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik .
The International Association of Firefighters political arm has long targeted Giuliani , accusing him of building an " urban legend " around images of himself wandering among the wreckage of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Their latest salvo comes as the former New York mayor who once was thought to have a lock on the GOP nomination finds his poll numbers tanking in Florida , a state his campaign has focused almost exclusively on in recent weeks .
The firefighters ' mailer is targeting " security moms " in the sunshine state and will be sent to 128,000 women between the ages of 40 and 80 before next Tuesday 's primary , reports The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder .
It says Giuliani is not qualified to be president because of his poor judgement and penchant for hiring unqualified , possibly corrupt loyalists .
" Instead of hiring a real police chief , " it says , " Giuliani appointed his driver , Bernard Kerik .
He then asked President Bush to appoint him as secretary of Homeland Security when Kerik was on the verge of a federal indictment .
Giuliani would rather reward unqualified loyal cronies that real leaders .
He can't be trusted with decisions on such important issues . "
The Giuliani campaign released an ad Thursday featuring a positive testimonial from the brother of a firefighter who died on 9/11 .
The firefighters ' union also relies on testimonials from relatives of 9/11 victims .
" My son was a fire fighter who died on 9/11 .
I resent Rudy Giuliani using this tragedy for his own political gain . " the mailer quotes FDNY Deputy Chief Jim Riches saying .
" He 's a coward who left out city unprepared for a terrorist attack . "

PITTSBURGH -- Sidney Crosby pauses as he walks down the hallway of the Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh .
He hears the happy cries of a boy in one of the rooms just visited , so he stops , retraces his steps and disappears behind a curtain in the room .
" Hat fit OK , buddy ? "
Crosby asks the boy , who can't speak .
A behind - the - scenes look at Sidney Crosby during a recent visit to Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh .
There are more excited noises .
Crosby is part of a small group of players moving from room to room , handing out fuzzy Hockey Fights Cancer blankets and signed Pittsburgh Penguins hats , game programs and posters during the team 's annual visit to the Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh .
There are no cameras in the room to capture this moment ; the television crews chronicling the team 's visit are waiting for Crosby in the next room .
Yet , here he is , in a moment away from the cameras , the buzz , the crowds .
A quiet moment in a life that is rarely quiet .
Rarely has one so young been asked to do so much for a sport .
Rarely has one so young delivered so much .
The youngest scoring champion in any major sport , the only teenager to win an NHL scoring title , the youngest player to win the Lester B. Pearson Award ( the players ' MVP award ) .
A star whose impact has raised the game 's profile at a time when the NHL desperately needed someone to lead the game out of the wilderness created by the lockout .
Crosby 's life almost always is measured in magnification and superlatives , in multimillion - dollar contracts and endorsements .
But the story of a 20 - year - old 's existence and his efforts to just simply fit in often is told in those small moments .
Crosby is well - acquainted with an NHL view few players see -- service elevators , kitchens and side entrances of very fine hotels .
" I think that 's kind of like automatic now , " Crosby told ESPN.com in a recent interview .
" ' OK , where is it and what time are we going to meet there ? '
If anything changes , it 's almost like , ' OK , I 'll see you in the lobby . '
We probably meet more often in a service elevator . "
But Crosby receives a rare treat when coach Michel Therrien gives the team a day off the day before the Penguins ' game against the Thrashers in Atlanta .
Crosby takes advantage and heads to a mall with some teammates .
It 's a bit of heaven as shoppers recognize the group as hockey players but not Crosby as " the " hockey player .
" It was cool , " Crosby said .
" It 's not like I have n't shopped before , but it'd been a while since I walked around a mall and not gone out quicker or just been kind of in and out .
It was nice to just kind of wheel around for a bit and check out some places . "
It would n't last long .
Saturday is game day in Atlanta , and some two dozen fans stand outside The Ritz - Carlton near Philips Arena .
Hockey has a tenuous hold in this city , so the crowd speaks to the drawing power of No. 87 .
The group waits as players and coaches exit the hotel to board the bus to the morning skate .
Crosby is nowhere in the main group because he 's being led out a side entrance and onto the bus .
" It 's like this everywhere , " says Frank Buonomo , senior director of team services and media relations for the Penguins .
Fans congregate again at the Ritz several hours later , still waiting for a glimpse of Crosby .
They finally get their wish when he exits the main entrance , clutching a white shopping bag , signing autographs before heading to the game .
All requests for Crosby 's time are filtered through the prism of , " How does this affect my teammates ? "
Interviews and photo shoots often are carried out in the morning before other players arrive .
" For me , it 's understood that 's the way it 's going to be , " Crosby said of the attention .
" For me , being on the road , it 's more about your teammates , too .
You want to spend time with them when you 're on the road .
You do n't want them to have to go through all the stuff that you have to go through , too .
" I do n't want to say I drag them down , but sometimes there are situations where they have to wait for me if I 'm signing or people come to the table and things like that .
It 's probably something I do n't want to put them through .
So , it 's the best for everyone if we can kind of just pick our spots . "
Ryan Whitney is among a group of young Penguins players who have grown up in the NHL together .
Five years older than Crosby , Whitney is shocked at the Crosby - mania .
" It was weird for me to see at the beginning because I 'd never seen that much attention paid to just one person , " Whitney says .
He remembers 8,000 people showing up at a practice in Montreal to watch Crosby and recounts how Sid parks his car near , but not at , the team 's practice facility before catching a ride with teammates or staff because otherwise it would take him hours to get out of the facility .
Even something simple , like going out for dinner in Toronto , has to be planned out like a military operation .
Crosby and friends have to call ahead for a private room , have to make sure there are cars ready to drop them off and pick them up so they 're not standing around drawing a crowd .
Whitney imagines it must get frustrating at times .
" Not that he 'd ever say it .
" You forget who he is until you get outside of the hotel . "
When Crosby gets to the television remote first , he clicks madly from channel to channel .
It drives road roommate Colby Armstrong mad .
How can you tell what 's on when you click like that , Armstrong asks ?
You can't .
Which is why he prohibits Crosby from taking control of the clicker .
Then , there 's Crosby 's show selection .
Armstrong is an A&E guy , biographies , cold case shows .
Crosby ?
" He does n't know anything about TV shows , not like I do , " Armstrong confides .
" He likes ' Friends . '
I know .
It hurts . "
Crosby 's rebuttal : " He 's into those reality shows and that celebrity stuff , and I 'm not too big on them .
" We 'll get in late , and it always seems like they have those National Geographic shows on at 2 a .m. in the morning in the hotel , so we get stuck watching stuff like that ...
For the most part , he likes things like ' American Justice ' and ' Cold Case ' and things like that . "
Crosby then says his roommate has a television secret of his own ... " Ellen . "
" I 'm going to throw him under the bus on that one .
He loves Ellen DeGeneres , " Crosby says .
Right before a pregame nap ?
" No , it 's right after .
It 's hilarious .
To a T , we wake up from our nap and that show 's coming on and she 's dancing . "
When Armstrong finds out Crosby has spilled the beans , Armstrong drags a reporter over to Crosby and announces loudly that he wants to do the interview over , that he 's going to reveal Sid 's affection for Chandler on " Friends . "
Crosby interrupts , revealing that not only does Armstrong love " Ellen " but he also likes to dance along to her show opening .
The two players are in stitches .
Armstrong is a perfect foil for Crosby .
He is a physical , dogged player .
Off the ice , he is irreverent and jocular .
It is no coincidence Crosby gravitates toward him .
" I look at my friends from junior or now , the pattern never changes .
There are always those kinds of guys .
I do n't think it 's by fluke , " Crosby says .
" When you 're around each other , you know what 's going on , whether you 're having a bad day , a good day , that kind of thing .
" Those guys are guys who keep everything light , and [ it 's ] kind of always a good feeling to be around those guys , just guys that are fun to be around .
Sometimes , you can't do the things that they do , so I always kind of live through him sometimes . "
Like the time the two stopped for coffee in a Montreal store .
Inside was a life - size cutout of Crosby promoting the World Junior Championship for a Canadian TV network .
Armstrong grabbed the cutout and danced around the store .
Everyone howled .
Then , Armstrong said , the Crosby " radar " kicked in .
People filled the store before the players escaped in a cab and headed to the rink .
Armstrong , not surprisingly , makes sure Crosby does n't get any special treatment among the team .
" Every little thing , I 'm all over him about it .
It 's my only chance , " Armstrong says .
And Crosby gives as good as he gets .
For every comment Armstrong makes about the size of Crosby 's butt ( " It 's kind of big " ) , Crosby will chide his friend about the way he eats and the noises he makes when he sleeps .
" He rips me about the way I sleep because I 'm a mouth breather , " Armstrong says .
" He rips me to my face in front of the whole team .
Can you believe that ? "
Armstrong also kids Crosby about his choice in clothes -- all blacks and dark blues and pinstripes .
" He 's a pretty old - fashioned kind of guy , " Armstrong says .
" His suits are black and blue , nothing fancy .
He 's just a kind of old - fashioned kind of guy .
He 's always saying , ' That 's the way it is in Nova Scotia . '
What you see is what you get with him . "
Does Crosby see himself as old - fashioned ?
" Yeah , I think that I 'm pretty simple , " he said .
" I think that 's part of just trying to be one of the guys , I think .
I do n't want to stick out much .
I think class is always something I was taught , so I just to try to do that . "
There is a giddiness about the Penguins ' practice facility .
The team has just enjoyed a spirited session of on - ice baseball , a complicated ( to the uninitiated ) game that involves flipping the puck high into the air and scoring against a group of defenders ... or something like that .
Enforcer Georges Laraque races into the locker room , looking for help to move Kris Letang 's car from the team parking lot while the rookie is still on the ice .
Veteran Petr Sykora regales teammates with a grisly story about a dead deer he encountered while he was with the New Jersey Devils .
Whitney chases Jordan Staal into the room , hurling his gloves at the big center and complaining Staal has broken his stick deliberately , a claim Staal vigorously denies .
" Put a shirt on , " Armstrong mocks as Crosby wanders by .
It 's not a refuge but a shared experience for all the players in the room regardless where they 're from or where they 're going .
Crosby is just another guy on the team .
Being captain brings different responsibilities , but , Crosby says , " You still want guys to feel the same and treat you the same , and I think that 's the way things are here .
" I like that atmosphere .
I like being in the room .
I 'm young , still enjoy things , and I do n't think I 'm any different than anyone else . "
Pranks included .
" I have n't got anything too severe .
I try to stay out of that , " Crosby said .
" Once you get involved in that stuff , you can't get out of it ; you 're either retaliating or somebody 's retaliating against you .
I get shaving cream in my shoes or in my towel or baby powder on my towel .
Just stuff like that .
Guys know that I do n't want people to mess around with my equipment , so they usually stay clear of that . "
Netminder Marc - Andre Fleury smiles when asked what the best Crosby prank might be .
For a moment , Fleury appears ready to tell the story , but he hesitates .
" No , I ca n't tell you .
It 's personal . "
But Fleury does give us something .
During a time when opposing players and critics were accusing Crosby of whining too much to officials , his teammates regularly hid baby clothes or baby shoes in Crosby 's dressing room stall .
Did Crosby think it was funny ?
Not really , Fleury admits .
Still , there is n't a hint of any acrimony between Crosby and his teammates .
There is a heartfelt awe of the young man , and more than a little protectiveness .
Darryl Sydor was brought in during the offseason to provide some veteran stability to the Pens ' defense corps .
The two - time Cup winner has played with some of the game 's biggest stars -- Vincent Lecavalier , Brett Hull , Mike Modano and Wayne Gretzky .
When Gretzky went to Los Angeles and helped establish a beachhead for the game in California , he was a veteran player .
Not like Crosby , who was absorbing pressure and attention even before the Penguins won him in the post - lockout lottery .
" It really is like paparazzi following a movie star , " Sydor said .
" He 's accepted that .
" What I 'm amazed at is how he handles himself through it all and how he keeps himself focused , " Sydor said .
" He 's not a real young player , he 's a young man . "
To be Crosby , " It 'd be tough .
You 'd have to be mentally strong . "
A recurring theme of the Gretzky persona is his ability to make everyone on every team he played on or coached feel part of the process , from trainers to team presidents .
There is a similar trend with Crosby .
After he signed a big endorsement deal with Reebok , the company wanted to send promotional material to Crosby .
He said he did n't want anything unless his teammates and staff got the same .
Basic manners sometimes are forgotten by stars , but not with Sid .
Crosby frequently keeps in contact with a wheelchair - bound girl from Montreal .
When the Pens are in town , Crosby gets tickets for her and her family and always manages to spend some alone time with them .
On one visit , Crosby invited her down for the morning skate .
He gave her signed Pens gear and made sure players gave her high fives on their way to the ice .
Not long after the visit , Montreal 's training staff received a text message from Crosby , thanking them for helping with the visit .
It 's conceivable Crosby would sign every autograph and answer every reporter 's question .
For that reason , the hockey gods made Buonomo .
As Pittsburgh GM Ray Shero puts it , there are n't many folks waving " We Love Frank Buonomo " placards .
When it 's time to drag Crosby away , Buonomo is the bad guy .
He filters the dozens of requests for interviews and photo shoots that pour into the Penguins ' offices .
He works with Crosby to schedule appearances mandated by rights holders and the league .
" You 'd think it might die down , but it has n't , " Buonomo says .
" Every day , you get something . "
As we speak , there are requests from Time , local television stations wanting one - on - ones for sweeps weeks , The Associated Press for pre-All - Star coverage , a television show in Toronto .
Before the Penguins go on the road , Buonomo ascertains what the team 's hotel security provisions are at each stop to ensure the hotel is prepared to deal with anywhere from a dozen to a hundred fans .
At a recent stay in New York , security plans went awry and Crosby had to make his way through a massive throng to the team bus .
Next time , there will be police to handle the situation .
But one of the most important things to Crosby is that he not be seen as someone who does n't want to sign autographs , especially when kids are involved .
It is important to him that kids get a chance to get close to him .
" I can always put myself in their situation .
I easily reflect back on being young , " Crosby says .
" I have a younger sister ; [ Mario Lemieux 's ] got four younger kids .
There 's something about younger kids that I just , I want to see them be happy . "
During the playoffs last year , when the Penguins were in Ottawa , Crosby spied a group of children within the hundreds of fans and whispered to Buonomo to bring them over so he could sign for them .
" It has to be the right balance .
You can't burn the kid out , " Buonomo said .
" But he understands it .
He gets it .
I always tell him to be honest with me . "
" I guess I do n't look at media things , as far as interviews , as a building block , " Crosby says .
" If it 's good attention because things are going well , then I 'm not going to look down upon that ... "
" It 's like waking up and putting my skates on every day .
...
For me , I need to be at my best , I do n't need the interviews every morning .
But if that 's what comes along with it , doing something good , so be it . "
Everyone seems to want a piece of Crosby .
It 's not a new phenomenon .
Jack Johnson , the third overall pick in the 2005 draft , also known as The Crosby Draft , has known Crosby since they were youngsters at Shattuck - St. Mary 's , the prestigious hockey prep school in Faribault , Minn .
Johnson remembers visiting Crosby 's home in Cole Harbour , Nova Scotia , after their freshman year and seeing people camped out on the property , sometimes slipping items under the door for Crosby to sign .
" I always get a big kick out of it because I 've always known him as Sid the person , " Johnson says .
" I always laugh when people are going bananas for him .
He was always just as much a normal kind of kid as anyone .
" He 's still like that .
It 's just that most people do n't see that . "
Somewhere down the line , Crosby is going to make room in his life for more than his favorite stick and his dog , Sam .
It 's only natural .
He knows that .
But doing ordinary things , such as meeting a girl , calling her and going out for dinner ?
Well , it 's just not that easy when you 're Sidney Crosby .
As agent and mentor Pat Brisson pointed out , in this new age with Facebook and YouTube and MySpace , anyone with a cell phone suddenly can go into paparazzi mode should she by chance meet someone like Crosby on a date .
Look at the Tony Romo - Jessica Simpson brouhaha during the NFL playoffs .
Tom Brady 's love life is the stuff of tabloid heaven .
Earlier this season , compromising pictures of Toronto Maple Leafs rookie Jiri Tlusty appeared on the Internet .
" It 's a little bit more difficult for me , " Crosby said of the dating scene .
" I 'm pretty picky , too .
I think that just comes from having a routine .
I 'm so into the routine that I have ; if you 're going to be in a relationship , somebody 's going to have to be pretty understanding .
I think that 's just something I 'm not in a huge rush [ about ] .
I 'm going to just kind of go with the flow . "
And as Crosby gets older , he finds he is more cautious about how much he reveals .
" I think more guarded , for sure .
Just because I realize that I have other responsibilities -- family , friends .
I understand that hockey is a big part of my life ; but also , as I get older , I realize there are other things that are important to me -- family , things like that . "
It makes sense he is more cautious about people 's motives , and likewise treasures the times away from these pressures .
He still lives with Lemieux and the owner 's family and enjoys the quiet of their neighborhood and its nearby parks .
He also bought a house about 20 minutes outside Halifax , Nova Scotia , that has become his offseason retreat .
" In the summer , I just love to fish .
I fish pretty much every day .
My dog --
I got a dog here last year at the start of the season -- she 's with my family now , but I just like to try and get away .
My house is in the woods .
I love it .
I love being away .
" All year round , I do n't know if I would enjoy that just as much , but I think for the amount of time I 'm there -- three and a half months at most , probably -- it 's really something where I can really recharge a bit .
You know , I 'm still working out and things like that , but it 's definitely a special place , and there 's not too many places like that I 've been to , so I really enjoy it . "
When describing his new place to an interviewer last season , Crosby was asked whether he just ran around naked in the woods and joked that he wore a loincloth .
" Yeah , I 'm one with nature now , " he joked .
Crosby enjoys decorating his new pad .
" I 'm not a huge shopper , but now that I 've got a house , it 's kind of something that 's fun , " he says .
" I 've got a shuffleboard table .
That was something I was pretty happy to get . "
We are standing in the Penguins ' dressing room shortly before the team 's hospital visit .
Former Pittsburgh defenseman Phil Bourque -- a man who won Stanley Cups with the Pens in 1991 and 1992 and is now a broadcast analyst with the team -- leans over and quietly explains that sometimes when he 's faced with significant decisions in his life , he finds himself wondering , " What would Sidney do ? "
When the story is related to Crosby 's agent , Brisson seems nonplussed .
" I think there are a lot of people who ask themselves that , ' What would Sidney do ? ' "
Brisson said .
The hospital visit is close to wrapping up , and all the players have reconvened in a noisy playroom .
Some are doing puzzles ; others are chatting and posing for pictures .
Crosby ends up shooting a game of pool with a young man who has suffered a second sports - related concussion .
Crosby chats with the boy while his father snaps pictures with his cell phone .
After turning his back for a few seconds , Crosby asks the boy , " Hey , you just did n't throw down a couple of balls , did you ? "
The boy grins and later asks Crosby to sign his hat .
" You can put down that you beat me at pool . "
The cameras are whirring , and pictures are being snapped .
It does n't seem to matter to Sidney Crosby , or to the people around him .

COLUMBIA , South Carolina ( Reuters ) - South Carolina Democrats voted on Saturday in a bitter presidential nominating race , with Barack Obama leading Hillary Clinton in polls and counting on heavy black support to carry him to a needed victory .
Voter turnout was heavy soon after polls opened at 7 a.m. under cloudy skies and chilly temperatures around much of the state , with long lines at polling places reported in early morning balloting .
Record turnout of more than 300,000 is expected in the first Democratic primary in the South , where black voters are likely to make up about half of the electorate .
Polls close at 7 p.m. , with results available soon afterward .
“ I am absolutely convinced that we can win here , and we can win anywhere in the country , ” Obama , an Illinois senator , said at a late - night rally in Columbia that capped a week spent campaigning heavily across the state .
South Carolina is the latest test for Obama and Clinton , a New York senator , in their escalating battle for the right to represent the Democratic Party in November ’s presidential election .
After two consecutive losses , in New Hampshire and Nevada , Obama needs a win on Saturday if he hopes to head into the February 5 “ Super Tuesday ” contests in 22 states with a realistic chance of victory .
The high stakes fueled a week of angry accusations , harsh advertisements and increasingly personal jabs between the two candidates , capped by a volley of attacks on Obama from Clinton ’s husband , former President Bill Clinton .
Hillary Clinton spent Saturday chatting with voters in two restaurants before heading to Tennessee for a town hall meeting in Nashville , leaving South Carolina before polls close .
The other candidate in the Democratic race , former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards , chastised his two rivals for their squabbling and ran ads promoting himself as the grown - up in the contentious nominating battle .
Edwards said the tone of the South Carolina contest was disappointing : “ There ’s been a lot of effort by the other two candidates to tear each other down which is why I ’m focused on the voters and doing positive things . ”
OBAMA LEADS
A Reuters /C-SPAN / Zogby poll on Saturday showed Obama with a 41 percent to 26 percent edge over Clinton in South Carolina , with Edwards in third place with 19 percent .
The lead for Obama , who would be the first black U.S president , is fueled by his 62 percent support among black voters , the poll found .
Clinton and Edwards are tied among white voters at 35 percent , with Obama at 19 percent .

Clinton left South Carolina for two days during the week and headed to states with contests on February 5 , leaving her husband to carry the campaign load here .
All three candidates have portrayed themselves as the strongest leaders of a shaky economy .
Clinton has hammered Obama for a lack of experience and highlighted her readiness to lead “ from day one ” in the White House .
But Obama questioned her judgment on Friday , noting her vote in 2002 to authorize the Iraq war and her failed stewardship of the health care overhaul during Bill Clinton ’s administration .

“ It ’s not a question of being ready on day one , ” he said at an evening rally in Florence , South Carolina .
“ It ’s a question of being right on day one . ”
The Republican presidential contenders , who held their primary in South Carolina last week , are focused on Florida ’s Tuesday primary .
Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are in a tight race in Florida , polls show , after splitting contests last week -- McCain won South Carolina and Romney won Michigan .
In St. Petersburg on Saturday , Romney peddled his economic message to factory workers , telling voters America needs an outsider to shake up Washington .
“ I know something about it .
I know a lot about it , ” he said of the economy .
“ I do n’t think someone from the inside is going to able to turn Washington inside out . ”
McCain took aim at Romney ’s experience , telling a rally in Fort Myers : “ I believe it is important not to have been a manager but a leader ... I can hire a lots of managers , but I believe I am qualified to lead and I have the record to prove it . ”
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is desperately seeking a good showing that could get him back in the race .
Giuliani , who once led the Republican field in national polls , has slipped after he essentially pulled out of the early voting states to concentrate on Florida .

In The Day Performance Didn't Matter Any More , I found that the performance of JavaScript improved a hundredfold between 1996 and 2006 .
If Web 2.0 is built on a backbone of JavaScript , it 's largely possible only because of those crucial Moore 's Law performance improvements .
But have we hit a performance wall ?
Is it possible for browsers to run JavaScript significantly faster than they do today ?
I 've always thought that just - in - time optimizing ( or even compiling ) JavaScript was an unexplored frontier in browser technology .
And now the landscape has shifted :
Apple 's WebKit team just announced a great new JavaScript benchmark , SunSpider .
The browser market is more competitive than it has been in years , with Opera 9.5 , Firefox 3 , Safari 3 , and IE 8 all vying for the coveted default browser position .
Perhaps browser teams will begin to consider JavaScript performance a competitive advantage .
The last time I looked for common JavaScript benchmarks , I came away deeply disappointed .
That 's why I 'm particularly excited by the SunSpider benchmark : it 's remarkably well thought out , easy to run , and comprehensive .
It 's based on real code that does interesting things ; both things that the web apps of today are doing , and more advanced code of the sorts we can expect as web apps become more advanced .
Very few of the tests could be classed as microbenchmarks .
It 's balanced between different aspects of the JavaScript language -- not dominated by just a small handful of different things .
In fact , we collected test cases from all over the web , including from other benchmarks .
But at the same time , we avoided DOM tests and stuck to the core JavaScript language itself .
It 's super easy to run in the browser or from the command line , so you can test both pure engine performance , and the results you actually get in the browser .
We included statistical analysis so you can see how stable the results you 're getting really are .
Maciej Stachowiak , a member of Apple 's WebKit team , graciously explained what each subsection of the benchmarks do in the comments :
3d Pure JavaScript computations of the kind you might use to do 3d rendering , but without the rendering .
This ends up mostly hitting floating point math and array access .
access Array , object property and variable access .
bitops
Bitwise operations , these can be useful for various things including games , mathematical computations , and various kinds of encoding / decoding .
It 's also the only kind of math in JavaScript that is done as integer , not floating point .
controlflow Control flow constructs ( looping , recursion , conditionals ) .
Right now it mostly covers recursion , as the others are pretty well covered by other tests .
crypto Real cryptography code , mostly covers bitwise operations and string operations .
date Performance of JavaScript's " date " objects .
math Various mathematical type computations .
regexp Regular expressions .
Pretty self - explanatory .
string String processing , including code to generate a giant " tagcloud " , extracting compressed JS code , etc .
SunSpider is the best JavaScript benchmark I 've seen , something we desperately need in an era where JavaScript is the Lingua Franca of the web .
I was so excited , in fact , that I ran some quick benchmarks to compare the four major players in the browser market :
Windows Vista 32 - bit
4 GB RAM
dual - core 3.0 GHz Core 2 Duo CPU
all browser extensions disabled ( clean install )
What surprised me here is that Firefox is substantially slower than IE , once you factor out that wildly anomalous string result .
I had to use a beta version of Opera to get something other than invalid ( NaN ) results for this benchmark , which coincidentally summarizes my opinion of Opera .
Great when it works !
I expected Opera to do well ; it was handily winning JavaScript benchmarks way back in 2005 .
The new kid on the block , Safari , shows extremely well particularly considering that it is running outside its native OS X environment .
Kudos to Apple .
Well , except for that whole font thing .
If you 're curious how each browser stacked up in each benchmark area , I broke that down , too :
If you need greater detail -- including variances -- you can download my complete set of SunSpider 0.9 results as a text file .
If I 've learned anything from the computer industry , it 's that competition benefits everyone .
Here 's hoping that a great JavaScript browser performance showdown spurs the browser teams on to better performance in this increasingly crucial area .

There 's something to be said for a game that knows its limitations .
For a game that does one thing well instead of making a half - ass attempt at covering six different genres at once and having a plot that " makes you think . "
Urban Chaos is just such a game .
Never mind that " terrorist " gangs are attacking paramedics , firemen , and dockworkers for no apparent reason .
Never mind that they all wear hockey masks .
Never mind that all this terror occurs in an unnamed city , referred to by the Channel 7 news anchor / narrator as " our city . "
Never mind that this anchor , who opens every level with breaking reports of the latest terrorist attack , works longer hours than Pat Kiernan .
Continue Reading >>
Never mind what 's wrong with this picture Never mind that the unnamed city 's solution is to form a " special police unit with military authority " whose members are awarded medals for every 10 people they taser or shoot in the face .
Because , Due Process be damned , I like tasering people and shooting them in the face .
And the only thing better than doing it to a couple people is doing it to hundreds of them .
And I do n't want to run around picking up health and ammo either - if you 're not man enough to get through the level with what you 've got then you do n't deserve a friggin medal .
Unless , of course , you tasered or shot 10 people in the face .
And all these medals need to mean something .
No I do n't want any fucking unlockable concept art , thank you , give me more range on my taser , or a better scope with which to shoot people in the face .
What I 'm trying to say is it 's all about flow .
Too many times in too many games playing is more like working , be it grinding , scrolling , trolling , patrolling , backtracking , or fishing .
A little repetition ( or a lot ) is n't so bad if it happens smoothly , and quickly , without all the bullshit .
So lock and load .
These could be as useful as a pair of running shoes
American scientists created mice which carried a gene that , when switched on , gave them muscles similar to those produced by weight training .
When the gene was off , the mice - which were fed a fast food diet - became obese and developed liver problems .
But when on , the same mice burned up fat , the Cell Metabolism study said .
In addition , the fatty liver disease it had developed while the gene was off disappeared , and it stopped being resistant to insulin , a condition which can lead to type II diabetes .
This was despite the fact that the mouse was still eating a diet high in fat and sugar and did not increase its physical activity .
The team from the Boston University School of Medicine ( BUSM ) genetically engineered the mouse to grow a certain type of muscle - known as Type II - which develops as a result of resistance training .
This is different to the muscle which forms as a result of endurance training such as running , known as Type I .
Speeding up
" We 've shown that Type II muscle does more than allow you to pick up heavy objects , " said Kenneth Walsh of BUSM .
" It 's also important in controlling whole - body metabolism . "
If you have these muscles , even when you are not doing much , you are still burning up energy
Professor Ken Fox
Bristol University
The researchers suggested it may be because an increase in this type of muscle sparks changes in the rest of the body .
Professor Ken Fox , an exercise specialist at the University of Bristol , said that attention was increasingly turning to resistance exercise as a means to improve metabolism .
" If you have these muscles , even when you are not doing much , you are still burning up energy .
" It 's a hot topic at the moment .
It 's something that could be particularly useful for older people who may have trouble with endurance exercise , and it can be very satisfying because the effects of resistance training appear very quickly . "

This year 's Consumer Electronics
Show had a number of 3D TV technologies on show .
And now similar technology has turned up at GDC .
Graphics giant Nvidia has developed technology than can give games a true 3D perspective using polarising glasses and stereoscopic display systems .
Nvidia 's system uses software drivers which split the video output into two views , which are slightly out of alignment .
The demo system I was shown had a 46inch television , which had a passive polarising filter over the screen .
It takes each scan line from the images and selects it either for the left or right eye .
The glasses map those views to the appropriate eye .
Without the glasses you see the two views .
Nvidia say developers do n't have to do any extra work for their games to work with the system - but do have to follow some rules .
About 80 games will work with the system at launch , which comes in a few weeks .
So how effective is it ?
From the demo I was shown , very .
But what I was shown was pretty limited - a menu screen for Age of Empires III , which rendered a townscape into an impressive diorama which felt like you could reach in and touch roof tops and people at the back of the view .
The other demo was a flight simulator and that proved very effective .
A sense of depth when flying is very valuable and it definitely aided the experience .
The TV it was being demonstrated on cost more than $ 6,000 but I 'm told there are compatible displays for under $ 1,000 .
Quite who is willing to pay out for such an embryonic technology remains to be seen .
Shrinking Solidarity in Afghanistan ?

Being in the hospitality industry , bartenders do n’t like to grumble .
But there are certain drinks they hate to make .
The primary reason a particular cocktail earns bartenders ’ ire is the time it takes to make .
On a busy night , with patrons three - deep , most bar professionals do n’t want to spend five minutes muddling mint leaves .
Other dreaded orders are popular drinks that have no accepted , consistent recipe ; the martini is a classic example .
These invite the customer to say the drink was made incorrectly , no matter how it was mixed .
It is not always the drink itself the bartender hates ; sometimes it ’s the timing .
Even the most simple shaken cocktail is a hassle during Friday - night rush hour .
But some drinks are the bane of bartenders at any time of day .
Here are five examples .
The Lemon Drop .
This very common cocktail can come as a shot or in a martini glass .
It ’s a combination of vodka ( commonly citron - flavored ) , fresh - squeezed lemon juice and sugar that threatens to leave you with a hangover .
People love Lemon Drops because they ’re fruity , sweet and often come in a glass rimmed with sugar .
However , this drink is time - consuming to make and leaves the bartender with sticky hands .
Paschal Smith , bartender at the Bitter End in San Francisco , says he hates making them “ because of the damn sugar . ”
If the bar is busy and you crave that citrus flavor , consider having a Kamikaze , which does n’t include that bothersome sugar .
The Manhattan .
The Manhattan is a classic cocktail usually made from whiskey , sweet vermouth and a dash of bitters , served straight up or on the rocks with a cherry .
Devotees favor this cocktail because of its old - time flavor and potency .
Bartender Eric Berchtold of the Cinch in San Francisco says he does n’t like to make Manhattans because , “ Too many things go into it and everyone wants them made a different way . ”
Some insist on bourbon , others on Canadian whiskey or rye .
Some people want cherry juice or Cointreau added .
Berchtold has had patrons order the drink because it makes them seem debonair , yet when it arrives , they decide they do n’t like the taste of bitters .
When ordering a Manhattan , help the bartender by specifying the type of whiskey you want .
If you want anything more than whiskey , vermouth and bitters , ask for it .
The Cosmopolitan .
The popular Cosmopolitan carries the same pitfalls as the Manhattan .
A basic recipe is vodka , lime juice , cranberry juice and triple sec ( an orange liqueur ) .
But ever since the character Carrie Bradshaw on “ Sex in the City ” demanded perfection in her Cosmopolitan , people have had high standards in what was originally a fairly simple drink .
While fresh lime juice is usually preferred , some people insist on Rose ’s Lime Juice .
Others want sweet and sour mix added to sweeten the cocktail and give it a pinker hue .
Sometimes Cointreau , a more expensive orange liqueur , is substituted for triple sec .
Without specific instructions , every bartender makes Cosmos differently .
If you want it made your way , you have to specify .
The Mojito .
Mojitos are delicious — they ’re minty and fresh , and they provide a strong buzz .
But , to most bartenders , the Mojito is the quintessential “ it takes too long to make ” drink .
The Mojito embodies every reason a bartender hates to make a cocktail .
First of all , it requires fresh mint , which must be muddled — mashed with a special tool to release its flavors .
This alone takes a few minutes .
Sugar and fresh lime juice — two sticky ingredients many bartenders dislike — are added , along with rum and soda water .
To top it off , Mojitos must be shaken .
Bartender Noah Esperas of le Duplex in San Francisco says , “ Go to a restaurant if you want a real Mojito . ”
He warns , “ Honestly , if I am slammed at 1 a .m. and someone asks for four Mojitos , I wo n’t make them .
If it costs $ 9 for a Mojito and $ 8 for a Grey Goose ( vodka ) , the bar is n’t losing much and I can make up for it in tips with the other people by saving time . ”
Specialties of another bar .
Just because you had a Lavender Martini at the Redwood Room in San Francisco , or an Angry Bleeding Minnow Farmer on vacation last spring in Hawaii , does n’t mean that you will find those drinks at every bar .
The Bitter End ’s Smith says , “ I hate making stuff I ’ve never heard of , which are most drinks these days . ”
If you must have a designer drink , you ’re going to have to know the recipe yourself .
It wo n’t help to bark a crazy name at the bartender and then get upset when she ’s never heard of it .
That said , most bartenders like to experiment .
Pick a time when the bar is n’t busy , describe the drink you had , be willing to pay for whatever the bartender concocts , and you just might re-create your vacation drinking experience .
Finally , a nice tip can turn any of these cocktails into a drink your bartender loves to make .

Five Drinking Stories That Put Yours To Shame

This year marks Dennis Kucinich ’s 40th year of involvement in civic life .
He has served as a member of the Cleveland City Council , as Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal Courts , as Mayor of the City of Cleveland , as Ohio State Senator and is now in his 6th term as United States Congressman .
In two presidential campaigns , he successfully kept progressive issues in the limelight .
Kucinich ’s voice in the Democratic presidential debates was effectively silenced by mega- corporations , many with links to the industrial war machine .
Highly questionable and possibly illegal methods were used to exclude his message from several debates , resulting in his forced absence from the presidential race .
Now his Congressional re-election bid is being similarly attacked .
The intensity is increasing as the March 4th primary gets closer .
One of opponent , Joe Cimperman ’s , television ads states , “ on ( Kucinich ’s ) watch we ’ve lost 38,000 jobs ” , cleverly inferring that it was the Congressman ’s fault .
Kucinich responds , “ the downtown Cleveland business establishments is paying hundreds of thousands of dollars , perhaps even a million dollars or more , to attack me in a way that is unprincipaled …
I ’ve been the national spokesperson challenging NAFTA .
I brought it up in all of the debates .
I ’ve been able to point out that we have lost millions of jobs in America because of NAFTA .
Of course , in Cleveland , in a period of about 10 years , we ’ve lost 38,000 jobs or more .
And so , one of the TV ads attacking me —ads that are paid for by the Cleveland corporate establishment — blames me for the losses of the 38,000 jobs that are attributed to NAFTA .
This is a ‘ swiftboat ’ type attack . ”
Union leader , Harriet Applegate , says Kucinich “ saved our steel industry , ” and that “ everyone knows that Cleveland has lost thousands of jobs because of NAFTA .
Now Joe Cimperman wants to blame Congressman Kucinich .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Dennis Kucinich has worked tirelessly for working people and that is why labor supports him .
He is the strongest opponent of NAFTA in Congress . ”
In fact , Kucinich directly saved 1560 jobs , created 3700 supporting jobs , and had an economic effect of $ 400 million annually , according to his campaign .

Now Lake Chad has shrunken dramatically due to the increased demand on its water .
Drastic changes to land and water wrought by climate change are forcing cartographers to redraw their maps of the world .
Evidence of the effects of human activities on the Earth 's features -- through climate change and construction efforts , such as irrigation projects — can clearly be seen in the new edition of The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World , its editors say .
( The atlas is one of the world 's oldest and most authoritative atlases ; the new edition was published on Sept. 3 . )
" We can literally see environmental disasters unfolding before our eyes , " said Mick Ashworth , editor - in - chief of the atlas .
" We have a real fear that in the near future famous geographical features will disappear forever . "
Shrinking lakes
Many of the changes the map - makers have had to make involve the shrinking of lakes and seas and changes to coastlines :
The Aral Sea in Central Asia has shrunk by 75 percent since 1967 ( before / after ) .
Lake Chad in Africa has shrunk by 95 percent since 1963 ( before / after ) .
The Dead Sea is 82 feet ( 25 meters ) lower than it was 50 years ago .
Sections of the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers in North America , the Yellow River in Asia and the Tigris River in the Middle East now dry out in the summer and at some times of the year the rivers do n't even reach the sea .
The coastline of Bangladesh had to be redrawn because heavier monsoons and rising sea levels are causing more land to be lost to the ocean .
Some Pacific Islands are also under threat from rising sea levels , including Kiribati , the Marshall Islands , Tokelau , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .
Melting ice , rising seas
Future editions of the atlas , which typically is researched by a team of more than 50 cartographers , will take into account changes in Arctic sea ice cover and other changes to lake , river , ocean and forest boundaries , as they are affected by the changing climate .
Experts with the atlas are keeping a close watch on the Inupiat village of Shishmaref , Alaska , where temperatures have steadily risen over the last three decades and the sea is encroaching at the rate of about 10 feet ( 3 meters ) per year , which could make it the first U.S. community forced to move due to a warming climate , the atlas makers say .
Villages on the low - lying islands of southeast India and south Bangladesh , called the Sundarbans , are also at risk , and some of the islands have already disappeared under rising seas .
The new edition of the atlas also notes that 40 percent of the world 's coral reefs have been destroyed or degraded in recent decades , and that more than 1 percent of tropical forest is cleared every year to make way for farmland .
On a more positive note , the atlas shows that 13 percent of the world 's land surface is now within designated protected areas worldwide .

Q . When you get up in the morning , you never want to go to work .
Your job is repetitive , uninteresting and offers no challenges .
When you are there , the clock barely moves , and you ca n’t wait to leave .
In short , you are bored .
What is to be done ?
A. People who are bored need to create more challenges and find more meaning in their work lives .
They need to find a way out of the feeling that “ there ’s nothing to do , they ’re forced to do things they do n’t want to do , or they do n’t know what they want to do , ” said John D. Eastwood , an associate psychology professor at York University in Toronto who has studied boredom .
Over all , boredom is a state of “ being disengaged from one ’s environment , ” he said , and it reflects a passive relationship to one ’s work .
Q. What are common symptoms of boredom ?
A . A telltale sign is that time seems to pass very slowly , Professor Eastwood said .
This can be accompanied by difficulty concentrating and feelings of depletion and lethargy .
Low - energy states may alternate with feelings of agitation and irritability as the sufferer struggles to find some kind of engagement , he said .

Dem strategist : MoveOn to blame for Lieberman endorsing McCain David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The liberal activist group MoveOn.org is to blame for Sen. Joe Lieberman 's ( I - CT ) backing of John McCain for president , according to one Democratic strategist who says the endorsement could have significant primary implications for Democratic contenders in New Hampshire .
In a Monday appearance on Fox News , longtime Democratic operative Bob Beckel said that MoveOn 's successful push to see Lieberman defeated in his 2006 primary race was now coming back to bite Democrats .
" This is the price ... us Democrats pay for MoveOn.org and others who drove Joe Lieberman out of the party , " said Beckel .
" They campaigned against him actively and raised money against him and he was beaten in the Democratic primary .
... now we 're paying the price and all I can say is ' a pox on their house . "
Many blogs have criticized Beckel , a former campaign manager for Walter Mondale and Robert F. Kennedy , since he began making regular appearances on Fox over the summer .
" Did Beckel pass up the opportunity to score points for what is supposed to be his own party because he ' did n't get it ' or because he had a sincere desire to dis Biden or in order to curry favor with the conservatives at FOX News ? " wrote the left - leaning News Hounds after one appearance , in which the strategist had agreed with Fox hosts that Democratic Senator Joe Biden and others " get a little bit more room " when it comes to minority support .
About Lieberman , Beckel suggested that the senator 's endorsement of a Republican was more than just a nose - thumbing gesture from the former Democrat .
" Joe Lieberman 's going to matter , " said the strategist .
" He 's the best known Independent , particularly in New England , and it 's going to matter because Independents in New Hampshire are the ones who decide , really , this election . "
The senator 's influence , he said , could also help Sen. McCain ( R - AZ ) to attract voters who may otherwise have backed Democrats in New Hampshire 's key early primary .
" Independents can vote in the New Hampshire primary either for the Democrats or the Republicans , " he said .
" If they go into the Republican primary -- which they did in 2000 , which helped McCain win then -- Joe Lieberman will help do that . "
Fox News commentator and Democrat Tammy Bruce , a self - described " openly gay , pro-choice , gun owning , pro-death penalty , voted - for - President Bush authentic feminist , " said her party had distanced itself from " authentic Democrats " like the " Kennedy version ... or the Shriver version . "
Lieberman 's endorsement , she said , gave like - minded Democrats permission to look across party lines for a presidential candidate .
" What this endorsement does more than anything , " Bruce said , " is it tells Democrats who do n't like what they see on the Democratic front that it 's okay to vote Republican ... if you 're a Democrat like me and you 've already decided you 're going to vote Republican , you already know who you like .
But for those who might not quite know where to go , this is helpful to them . "

Dressed in a branded suit with high heels to boot and driving a Rolls Royce , Chen Ailian appears to be the archetypical success story .
She is that , and an ardent member of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , too .
And she sees no contradiction .
The 49 - year - old , who leads a sprawling business empire , has drawn much attention at the ongoing 17th CPC National Congress as the sole representative of the private sector from Zhejiang Province , the cradle of the country 's entrepreneurs .
Chen , who started as a truck driver , is chairwoman of Wanfeng Auto Holding Group - the largest manufacturer of aluminum alloy wheels in Asia and one of the top 50 auto parts suppliers in the country .
Her story best epitomizes the boom of the private economy and the rising political status of the private sector .
Chen began her career in the auto parts business in 1994 by borrowing half a million yuan ( $ 66,600 ) and renting an abandoned factory with a dozen lathes .
Now , her business has expanded to the European , American and Japanese markets , with partnerships sealed with key carmakers such as Ford , Toyota , and GM .
Half of her company 's sales are overseas .
The group , headquartered in Shaoxing - Chen 's hometown - has branches in eight provinces and cities including Guangzhou , Shanghai and Shandong .
Chen joined the Party in 1995 a year after she started her business ; and also set up a Party organization in her group in the late 1990s , a rare move for a private entrepreneur .
That has given her business a sharper edge as four in five in her management and technology teams are Party members .
When she was elected a delegate to the Party congress , Chen was not surprised .
" Like workers , farmers , intellectuals , cadres and soldiers , private entrepreneurs are also builders of socialism with Chinese characteristics , " she said .
Private entrepreneurs used to be considered a symbol of capitalism and were long excluded from the Party .
But now they are recognized for their contribution to the economy .
The 16th CPC National Congress made it clear fresh blood from the private sector would be included in the Party ; and for the first time invited some delegates from private enterprises .
Chen said she does not see any conflict between driving a Rolls Royce and being a Party member .
" Do n't stereotype a Party member , who can also be modern , fashionable and open - minded , " she said .
Chen , who has master 's degrees in management , said proper management and innovation are key to the competitiveness of modern enterprises - her group has registered more than 100 technology patents this year .
The company notched up about 50 percent growth in sales each year during the past decade , and expects 15 to 30 percent annual growth in the coming years .
With 8.5 million cars produced last year , China has become the biggest car making market and third largest car consumption market in the world .

Romney : ... And I 'm not going to distance myself in any way from my faith .
But you can see what I believed and what my family believed by looking at , at our lives .
My dad marched with Martin Luther King .
Mitt Romney has defended his position on civil rights , in multiple high - profile settings , by insisting that his father marched with Martin Luther King during his tenure as governor of Michigan in the 1960s .
Pressed for specifics , the Romney campaign pointed to an event that occurred in Grosse Point , Mich .
The claim appears to be false — Romney ’s father did not march with King .
Unfortunately , the campaign has come up with an unpersuasive defense .
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has said he watched his father , the late Michigan Gov. George Romney , in a 1960s civil rights march in Michigan with Martin Luther King Jr. On Wednesday , Romney ’s campaign said his recollections of watching his father , an ardent civil rights supporter , march with King were meant to be figurative .
“ He was speaking figuratively , not literally , ” Eric Fehrnstrom , spokesman for the Romney campaign , said of the candidate .
C’mon , Romney campaign , you can do better than this .
Romney told two national television audiences , “ I saw my father march with Martin Luther King . ”
That was a “ figurative ” claim ?
I wonder what might have happened to Al Gore seven years ago if , confronted with the manufactured controversy about “ inventing the Internet , ” he said , “ I meant that figuratively . ”
Cops applaud presidential candidate By Jim Kouri
web posted January 7 , 2008
While most of the politicians vying for their party 's nomination for President of the United States pay lip service to the nation 's law enforcement officers , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) is actually doing something to earn the respect and gratitude of America 's cops , according to many police officers and organizations .
For example , the American Federation of Police -- with well over 100,000 members -- recently praised Ron Paul for introducing a bill that would help cops obtain topnotch body armor that would withstand rounds fired from most firearms .
Rep .
Paul 's bill -- HR 3304 -- would amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide for a tax credit to law enforcement officers who purchase their own body armor .
" I urge all police officers and concerned citizens to contact their congressmen and ask them to support Rep.
Paul 's bill , " said Deputy Sheriff Dennis Wise , president of the American Federation of Police .
" I would also like to applaud Congressman Ron Paul for his support and forward thinking in trying to help make law enforcement officers across our nation safer each day , " said Wise .
Rep. Ron Paul appears to be popular with many US cops .
" He 's never found it necessary to force police officers to stand with him for photo opportunities the way other presidential candidates such as Hillary Clinton do , " said New York Police Officer Edna Aguayo .
One police officer claims cops in New York and other states are forced to pose with the likes of Senators Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
If an officer refuses , he or she is charged with insubordination by their superiors .
" It 's a joke how these cops are used as props during election campaigns .
But Ron Paul does n't pay cops lip service -- he actually works to help them enforce the law , " said another cop forced to pose with Sen .
Clinton during one of her staged " rallies . "
Public opinion service Rasmussen Reports recently released data from its October 12 - 14 polling that indicates that Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul leads his GOP opponents against Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton among likely voters ages 30 - 49 .
He is the leading White House contender for the key demographic , polling higher than Clinton among baby boomers .
Congressman Paul polls in at 47 % , compared with Clinton 's 44 % , among likely voters aged 40 - 49 .
The 30 - 49 demographic has been a key indicator in recent elections , and one in which Republicans tend to fare well in hotly - contested elections .
In 2004 , exit polls reveal that George Bush beat John Kerry 53 % to 46 % among 30 - 44 year olds , and all accounts indicate that this will be the most instrumental demographic in the 2008 presidential election as well .
â€ œRon Paul is the only Republican candidate who can beat Hillary Clinton , â€ claims political strategist Kent Snyder .
More than 3,000 police officers ' lives have been saved by body armor since the mid-1970s when the National Institute of Justice ( NIJ ) began testing and developing body armor and performance standards for ballistic and stab resistance .
Recognition and acceptance of the NIJ standard has grown worldwide , making it the performance benchmark for ballistic - resistant body armor .
Body armor can provide protection against a significant number of types of handgun ammunition , but law enforcement personnel must keep in mind that armor is categorized and rated for different threat levels .
Additional protection should be worn for SWAT team operations , hostage rescues , or Special Operations assignments , when officers may be exposed to a weapon threat greater than the protection provided by regular duty armor , according to the National Institute of Justice .
Rank - and - file police officers also applaud Rep. Paul for his pro-sovereignty stance .
" The talk must stop .
We must secure our borders now .
A nation without secure borders is no nation at all .
It makes no sense to fight terrorists abroad when our own front door is left unlocked , " said the Texas congressman during a campaign rally .
In addition , Congressman Ron Paul believes that the Second Amendment is " not about duck hunting . "
It is an individual right that is guaranteed .
He stated that he believes it is about the citizenry having the ability to restrain tyrannical governments and would be dictators .
He believes the Second Amendment is about self - defense from criminal attack and from governments that break away from the chains of the Constitution .
According to a poll conducted by the National Association of Chiefs of Police , more than 75 % of the nation 's police officers agree with Rep .
Paul 's stance on gun ownership including private citizens carrying concealed weapons for personal protection .
Just recently Congressman Paul opposed the reauthorization of the Clinton - Feinstein semi-auto gun ban .
He opposes gun and gunowner registration .
And Paul opposes government permission systems that force law - abiding citizens " prove " their innocence before buying or owning firearms .
AFP president Dennis Wise agrees with Rep. Paul 's stance on gun control .
" When our founding fathers assembled to write one of the greatest papers ever written -- our Constitution -- they put down the amendments ... in the order of their importance , " said Wise .
Jim Kouri , CPP is currently fifth vice - president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police and he's a staff writer for the New Media Alliance .
Kouri also serves as political advisor for Emmy and Golden Globe winning actor Michael Moriarty .
He 's former chief at a New York City housing project in Washington Heights nicknamed " Crack City " by reporters covering the drug war in the 1980s .
In addition , he served as director of public safety at a New Jersey university and director of security for several major organizations .

Anti-depressant prescription rates have soared
Study author
A University of Hull team concluded the drugs actively help only a small group of the most severely depressed .
Marjorie Wallace , head of the mental health charity Sane , said that if these results were confirmed they could be " very disturbing " .
But the makers of Prozac and Seroxat , two of the commonest anti-depressants , said they disagreed with the findings .
A spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline , which makes Seroxat , said the study only looked at a " small subset of the total data available " .
Reviewed data
And Eli Lilly , which makes Prozac , said that " extensive scientific and medical experience has demonstrated it is an effective anti-depressant " .
There seems little reason to prescribe anti-depressant medication to any but the most severely depressed patients
Professor Irving Kirsch
University of Hull
Q&A : Anti-depressant study Popularity of ' happy pills '
Alan Johnson , the Health Secretary , has announced that 3,600 therapists are to be trained during the next three years in England to increase patient access to talking therapies , which ministers see as a better alternative to drugs .
Patients are strongly advised not to stop taking their medication without first consulting a doctor .
The researchers accept many people believe the drugs do work for them , but argue that could be a placebo effect - people feel better simply because they are taking a medication which they think will help them .
In total , the Hull team , who published their findings in the journal PLoS Medicine , reviewed data on 47 clinical trials .
They reviewed published clinical trial data , and unpublished data secured under Freedom of Information legislation .
They focused on drugs which work by increasing levels of the mood controlling chemical serotonin in the brain .
These included fluoxetine ( Prozac ) and paroxetine ( Seroxat ) , from the class known as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , alongside another similar drug called venlafaxine ( Efexor ) - all commonly prescribed in the UK .
The number of prescriptions for anti-depressants hit a record high of more than 31 million in England in 2006 - even though official guidance stresses they should not be a first line treatment for mild depression .
There were 16.2 m prescriptions for SSRIs alone .
The researchers found that the drugs did have a positive impact on people with mild depression - but the effect was no bigger than that achieved by giving patients a sugar - coated " dummy " pill .
People with severe symptoms appeared to gain more clear - cut benefit - but this might be more down to the fact that they were less likely to respond to the placebo pill , rather than to respond positively to the drugs .
HAVE YOUR SAY
When used correctly and appropriately anti-depressant therapy saves lives Stephen Brown , Birmingham
Lead researcher Professor Irving Kirsch said : " The difference in improvement between patients taking placebos and patients taking anti-depressants is not very great .
" This means that depressed people can improve without chemical treatments .
" Given these results , there seems little reason to prescribe anti-depressant medication to any but the most severely depressed patients , unless alternative treatments have failed to provide a benefit . "
Professor Kirsch said the findings called into question the current system of reporting drug trials .
Reviewing guidance
Dr Tim Kendall , deputy director of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Research Unit , has published research concluding that drug companies tend only to publish research which shows their products in a good light .
These medicines have been licensed by a number of regulatory authorities around the world , who looking at all the evidence , have determined that they do work better than placebo
Dr Richard Tiner
Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry
Readers ' experiences
He said the Hull findings undermined confidence in the ability to draw meaningful conclusions about the merit of drugs based on published data alone .
He called for drug companies to be forced to publish all their data .
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) is currently reviewing its guidance on the use of antidepressants .
Marjorie Wallace of Sane commented : " If these results were upheld in further studies , they would be very disturbing .
" The newer anti-depressants were the great hope for the future ....
These findings could remove what has been seen as a vital choice for thousands in treating what can be a life - threatening condition . "
Dr Andrew McCulloch , of the Mental Health Foundation , said : " We have become vastly over - reliant on antidepressants when there is a range of alternatives .
" Talking therapies , exercise referral and other treatments are effective for depression .
" It is a problem that needs a variety of approaches matched to the individual patient . "
Dr Richard Tiner , of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry , said there was no doubt that there was a " considerable placebo effect " from anti-depressants when treating people with mild to moderate symptoms .
But he said no medicine would get a licence without demonstrating it was better than a placebo .
Dr Tiner said : " These medicines have been licensed by a number of regulatory authorities around the world , who looking at all the evidence , have determined that they do work better than placebo . "
The Pirate Bay recently featured in an exhibition about online crime , run by the Swedish police - even before their trial has begun .
Pirate Bay's Brokep has had enough of being the punch bag of the Swedish authorities : " It 's slander , " he says " Authorities are not allowed to engage in political opinionation . "
The Swedish authorities are known for their foul play against The Pirate Bay .
Perhaps the biggest mistake they made was in the weeks before the raid , almost two years ago , when they caved in to pressure from the USA and MPAA .
But their latest move is pretty low , even for them .
The Swedish police are doing an exhibition about online crime , and somehow thought that it was a good idea to include The Pirate Bay .
Strange , because the Pirate Bay case has n’t even gone to court yet .
Nevertheless , the police decided to put them on display anyway , together with convicted pedophiles and cyber-criminals .
Brokep , one of the founders of the popular BitTorrent tracker could n’t believe it when he read the news : “ There ’s no trial .
No conviction .
TPB has done nothing wrong .
And still , the police think it ’s OK to show off the site together with convicted pedophiles and other nasty scum .
And without asking permission from anyone involved with the site , ” he writes on his weblog .
Brokep decided to contact the organizers of the exhibition , who admitted that they were wrong , and immediately removed all material about The Pirate Bay .
This is not the first time Brokep has fired back at the Swedish authorities , and certainly not the first time they ’ve made a mistake , as Brokep sums up at least 10 other “ mistakes ” in his blog post .
A few months ago we wrote about the alleged conspiracy against The Pirate Bay .
One of the Bay ’s biggest enemies seems to be BodstrÃ¶m , Minister of Justice in Sweden .
He is the person who was held responsible for the Pirate Bay raid last year , after the US gently pressured him into taking action .
This is probably not the last clash The Pirate Bay will have with the Swedish authorities , but let ’s hope they will at least obey the law next time , and not judge people before they are actually convicted of a crime .
Questions will surely be raised about the negative effect these type of actions are having on The Pirate Bay crew ’s chances for a fair trial .
Stay tuned …
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Google said Tuesday it is getting in on the development of electric vehicles , awarding $ 1 million in grants and inviting applicants to bid for another $ 10 million in funding to develop plug - in hybrid electric vehicles capable of getting 70 to 100 miles per gallon .
The project , called the RechargeIT initiative and run from Google 's philanthropic arm , Google.org , aims to further the development of plug - in hybrid electric vehicles - cars or trucks that have both a gasoline engine and advanced batteries that recharge by plugging into the nation 's electric grid .
" Since most Americans drive less than 35 miles per day , you easily could drive mostly on electricity with the gas tank as a safety net , " Dan Reicher , director of Climate and Energy Initiatives for Google.org , wrote on the organization 's Web site .
" In preliminary results from our test fleet , on average the plug - in hybrid gas mileage was 30 - plus mpg higher than that of the regular hybrids . "
The project also aims to develop vehicle - to - grid ( V2G ) technology , allowing cars to sell their stored power back to the nation 's electricity grid during times of peak demand .
" Linking the U.S. transportation system to the electricity grid maximizes the efficiency of our energy system , " said Reicher .
" Our goal is to demonstrate the plug - in hybrid and V2G technology , get people excited about having their own plug - in hybrid , and encourage car companies to start building them soon . "
General Motors ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) has promised to sell a plug - in hybrid version of its redesigned Saturn Vue SUV but has not set a specific date for production .
The company has contracted with two battery suppliers to work on an improved battery technology for the vehicle .
The company is also working toward a production version of its Chevrolet Volt , a plug - in hybrid concept car shown at the 2007 Detroit Auto Show .
That vehicle would be driven entirely by electricity with an on - board engine used only as a back - up generator .
Ford Motor Co. ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) also has a drivable plug - in hybrid demonstration vehicle based on the Ford Edge SUV .
Similar to GM's Chevrolet Volt in its basic engineering , that vehicle uses a hydrogen fuel cell as a back - up generator but could use a gasoline engine or some other type of motor to charge the batteries .
Because they have to store up and release large amounts of electricity , plug - in hybrids require more advanced batteries than hybrid vehicles currently on the market .
The batteries in non-plug - in hybrid vehicles continuously store and release small amounts of electricity , a work cycle that puts little strain on the batteries .
Google takes on Detroit
While many people do n't associate Google with energy , analysts say the fit is n't all that unnatural .
Renewable energy , unlike coal or nuclear , will likely come from thousands or tens of thousands of different locations .
Analysts have long said that one of the big challenges will be managing that flow into and out of the nation 's electric grid , and that companies that manage the flow of information are well placed to handle that task .
The $ 1 million in Google grants went to Brookings Institution to run a conference on plug-ins , CalCars and Plug - In America to educate the public about plug-ins , and the Electrical Power Research Institute , the Rocky Mountain Institute and Dr. Willett Kempton from the University of Delaware for plug - in R&D .
Google ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) also said it has turned on its massive solar panel installation at the company 's Mountain View , Calif . headquarters .
At 1.6 megawatts , Google said it 's the biggest solar project on a corporate campus in the United States , and one of the largest in the world .
Ohio Sec. of State : Electronic voting machines do n't meet basic standards David Edwards and Muriel Kane

If you thought controversy over voting machines was a thing of the past , think again .
Just in time for the 2008 election season , Colorado has decertified hundreds of faulty electronic voting machines for being error - prone and easily hacked .
This news comes on the heels a massive study in Ohio that also found critical flaws in Buckeye State 's voting machines .
Yesterday , Colorado Secretary of State Mike Coffman decertified three of the four voting equipment manufacturers allowed in the state -- affecting six of Colorado's 10 most populous counties -- for their inaccuracy and for the ease with which they could be hacked .
Today , he backtracked slightly , noting that some of machines could still be used in November if a software patch was installed .
Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner spoke to MSNBC about Ohio's study , where teams were able to pick locks to access memory cards and use hand - held devices to plug false vote counts into machines .
They also concluded that hacker could break into the machines with " a magnet and a PDA . "
" We learned that there are critical security flaws , " she says , " because these machines are essentially computer - based voting equipment , and they do n't have the basic industry - required standards for security that we would use on computers that we use for banking or communications or other things in our everyday life . "
Brunner has recommended that for the March primary , counties with touch - screen machines allow voters to request a paper ballot that can be scanned optically .
She also reminded voters that they can vote through the mail using absentee ballots .
In the long run , Ohio may move to optical - scan ballots that would be checked by machine but also deposited in a ballot box and counted at the Board of Elections .
Brunner also proposed an early voting period 15 days before elections at vote centers located throughout the state .
This video is from MSNBC's News Live , broadcast on December 18 , 2007 .
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art that includes a color photograph of a nude woman in Christ 's place at the Last Supper was '' disgusting , '' ' ' outrageous ' ' and ' ' anti-Catholic . ''
Then he declared that he would appoint a commission to set '' decency standards ' ' to keep such work out of museums that receive public money .
Virtually every museum in New York City receives city money .
Mr. Giuliani , who tried to shut down the Brooklyn Museum in 1999 over the ' ' Sensation ' ' exhibition , which included a painting depicting the Virgin Mary with a dollop of elephant dung on one breast , said that even though he had lost that case in court , he was considering filing suit again .
If he did , he said , he might base his argument on a 1998 Supreme Court ruling that endorsed what the mayor called '' decency standards ' ' for the National Endowment for the Arts .
'' I 'm going to look at what penalties are available for this , '' Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference at City Hall .
Just as in 1999 , he was reacting to large headlines and pictures in The Daily News without having seen the exhibition itself .
He added that he and his lawyers would be investigating ''a way to get this dispute to the place where I think we could win it , which would be the Supreme Court of the United States . ''
Shhhh , keep this quiet .
Maybe nobody will notice .
Turkish warplanes , helicopters and artillery bombed suspected hideouts of Kurdish rebels in remote , mountainous terrain of northern Iraq Saturday .
The Turkish military said at least 35 Kurdish rebels and two Turkish soldiers died in fighting Saturday .
A total of seven soldiers and at least 79 rebels have been killed in Iraq since Turkey launched a ground incursion late Thursday , according to the military .
The rebel Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK , claimed it had killed 15 Turkish troops .
Massoud Barzani , head of the regional Kurdish administration in northern Iraq , warned Turkey it will face large - scale resistance if it targets civilians in its ground incursion ... read on

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Guess what , kids : Inflation is n't going away .
And that means the Federal Reserve 's job is getting tougher .
Oil is hovering around $ 100 a barrel .
And the January Consumer Price Index figures - released Wednesday morning - showed inflation bubbling up .
With that in mind , some see dimming hopes for more aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve .
The high inflation figures will " further complicate the Fed 's easing campaign , " said Ashraf Laidi , chief currency strategist with CMC Markets US , a New York - based brokerage firm , in a note Wednesday morning .
The Fed 's " dual mandate " is to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth .
And if the Fed keeps slashing interest rates , the risk is that the dollar will weaken further and this could fuel even more big spikes in commodity prices .
The new inflation numbers will make the Fed 's latest economic forecasts - which it will release this afternoon in conjunction with the minutes from its last meeting - even more important .
It 's unlikely the Fed will predict an actual decline in economic growth .
But it 's possible the Fed may have to lower its growth forecasts for 2008 as well as boost its projections for unemployment .
In October , the Fed said it expected gross domestic product growth of 1.8 % to 2.5 % for 2008 and an annual unemployment rate of 4.8 % to 4.9 % .
Laidi wrote that he thinks the Fed will reduce the low end of its 2008 GDP forecast to 1.5 % and raise the upper end of its unemployment projection to 5 % .
Others think that this year is n't the biggest problem for the Fed .
David Joy , chief market strategist for RiverSource Investments , said his biggest concern now is that the Fed may have to boost rates later this year to keep inflation in check .
If that 's the case , the current economic woes are nothing compared to what lies ahead .
" Our forecast is that the economy will be strong enough in the U.S. later in 2008 to cause inflation .
That will lead to the Fed raising interest rates and push us into a recession in the latter half of 2009 , " Joy said .
In other words , we have the classic case of stagflation rearing its ugly head - high inflation leading to slower growth .
The Fed can only do its best to combat one of these bugaboos at a time and Joy believes the Fed will eventually err on the side of reducing inflation .
He added that there could be some good news next year .
The worst might soon be over for housing and banks .
But 2009 could be highlighted by what Joy dubs " rolling sector recessions " - i.e. other parts of the economy start to experience slowdowns even as the credit market recovers .
Joy also predicts that the unemployment rate will head much higher than current levels next year .
Economists at Lehman Brothers also are forecasting a tough 2009 ... although not necessarily a recession .
In a report late last week , Lehman 's economists wrote that they see GDP growth in 2009 of just 0.8 % and an unemployment rate of 5.7 %
The Fed , for what it 's worth , forecast in October that GDP will increase 2.3 % to 2.7 % next year and that the unemployment rate will remain around 4.8 % to 4.9 %
So something 's gotta give .
I highly doubt the Fed will lower its targets to levels that are in line with the bleakest forecasts on Wall Street .
But if the central bank does n't reduce its projections significantly enough , it risks looking at best , Pollyannaish about the economy , and at worst , completely out of touch with reality .
What do you think ?
Will the economy bounce back in 2009 or is the worst yet to come ?
U.S. REPRESENTATIVE JESSE JACKSON , JR . ( D - IL ) : Republican say the underlying issue is not about sex , it 's about perjury .
The Democrats say the underlying issue is about sex -- a private consensual relationship -- and the president lied about it , possibly committing perjury in the process .
But since lying about sex is not an act involved using his official position against the state , as Nixon did , Democrats say Clinton 's sins do not reach the constitutional standard for impeachment .
That is the essence of the arguments we 've heard presented by members of Congress and the Judiciary Committee , but underlying the pending Clinton impeachment is neither sex nor lying nor perjury , but American history itself .
Essentially the same economic and political forces that drove the presidential impeachment process against Andrew Johnson in 1868 are driving the impeachment process 130 years later .
There has been a role reversal .
The Republicans of 1998 were the Democrats of 1868 , but the underlying issue is essentially the same -- reconstruction .
The first reconstruction was at issue in 1868 .
The second reconstruction is at issue in 1998 .
It could n't possibly be about the standard .
Congress determined that Mr. Nixon 's failure to pay taxes and his lying about failure to pay those taxes did not meet the constitutional standard , while felonious .
Mr. Clinton 's actions , while potentially felonious , does not reach the constitutional standard .
So we look to history for the answer .
People keep asking me every time I step outside of this Congress , " Why does the African - American community keep sticking with Bill Clinton ? "
When legal slavery ended , this why : there were nine million people in the old Confederacy , which was led by the Democratic Party .
Then the Democratic Party was defined in exclusive terms : slaveholders protected by states rights governments .
Four million people -- southerners -- were uneducated and untrained former slaves who wanted to be brought into the mainstream of America .
That did include poor and working class whites who wanted to be brought in .
The identification of Lincoln and the Republican Party with ending slavery led Southern Democrats to refer to Lincoln as the " black president " and the Republican Party as the " black Republican Party . "
Former Democratic Confederates upheld and resisted the big , centralized Republican federal government and wanted to get the government off of their states ' backs so they get all -- get right back to their old states rights ways .
Senator Andrew Johnson was a Tennessee Democrat who had refused to join his Southern Democratic confederates and stayed with the northern Unionists .
Lincoln , concerned about preserving and reunifying the union , the nation , following the war , he led and appointed that Democrat to become vice president .
When Lincoln was killed , President Johnson focused on putting the Union back together , but not on building a more perfect union for all Americans , and unlike Lincoln and the Republicans , he was willing to preserve the union by leaving some Americans behind , sacrificing the rights and interests of the former slaves .
This is why , as a result , those northern angry Republicans investigated a vulnerable Johnson who , not unlike Bill Clinton , had personal foibles , to try to come up with an excuse to impeach him .
It was a partisan attack by Republicans on a Democratic president in order to preserve undertaking the Republicans ' first reconstructive economic program [...]
JACKSON : Today 's conservative - based Republican target is not Bill Clinton , it 's second reconstruction , especially the liberalism of Democratic President Lyndon Baines Johnson , but also ultimately including the big government economic programs of FDR .
Let us not be confused .
Today Republicans are impeaching Social Security , they are impeaching affirmative action , they are impeaching women 's right to choose , Medicare , Medicaid , Supreme Court justices who believe in equal protection under the law for all Americans .
Something deeper in history is happening than sex , lying about sex and perjury .
In 1868 , it was about reconstruction and in 1998 , it 's still about reconstruction .
I yield back the balance of my time .
In December of 1998 , the House of Representatives , through a bill authored by serial adulterer Henry Hyde , during a lame - duck session of Congress where Speaker and serial adulterer Newt Gingrich ( who started up with a mistress while his wife was in the hospital with cancer ) had to hand over his gavel to Ray LaHood , during a floor debate marred by the resignation of potential House Speaker candidate and serial adulterer Bob Livingston , voted to impeach the President of the United States for only the second time in American history .
The count was 228-206 on the perjury charge , and 221 - 212 on obstruction of justice ( two other counts failed ) .
Being the anniversary week , C - SPAN decided to air large portions of the House debate .
I could n't stop watching .
You actually can read the transcripts here , but believe me when I tell you that the phony sanctimony from the Republicans is striking .
I 've never heard so many renderings of history , deep intoning about the Constitution and reverance for the rule of law come out in such a stream of pabulum in my life .
Set against the background of the current Administration , which has lied us into war , spied on American citizens , tortured and indefinitely detained suspects without trial in secret sites all over the world , subverted the will of the people through deliberate deception , and brought this country to its knees , all in full view of many of these same lawmakers , the experience of watching them speak is almost otherworldly .
What the Republicans were actually doing is throwing a hissy fit .
They saw in the Lewinsky case an opportunity to whine and cry and get a media predisposed to hating Bill Clinton on their side .
After all , he came in and trashed the place , and it was n't his place .
So they would use every rhetorical means at their disposal to make the impeachment about these abstract concepts of justice that theyregularly ignore these days , so that they could mask the fact that they were trying to remove a President over a blow job , and among those voting to sustain that were Larry Craig , Mark Foley , Randy " Duke " Cunningham and the entire cast of sexual and moral deviants .
The media , not recognizing that the public largely did n't care about Clinton 's infidelity as much as they cared about his policies , played the scandal to the hilt , using sensationalism for ratings glory , but also trying to cast a member out of their Village they prized so much , because the Clintons were n't part of their gang .
The endless series of blonde female prosecutors filled the cable nets , pundits of the kind of Chris Matthews sat around looking grim , and the High Broderists moaned about the " crisis " in Washington , which was the only place in the country there was a crisis , of course .
The Democrats did n't actually look laudatory in this debate .
Their greatest scorn was over the fact that they were denied a vote on censure , which they felt was the appropriate action ( this was true of the nascent online progressive movement as well ; MoveOn.org began as Censure and Move On in an attempt to get the Congress to do just that ) .
If a critique of this stunning power grab from the Republicans were made , it was that they were n't allowing a different kind of condemnation .
There was really only one speech that stood out from all the rest , at least among the few hours that I saw .
It was made by Congressman Jesse L. Jackson , Jr. , then a two - term Representative from the Second District of Illinois .
He still serves today and I wish he would engage with the online progressive community more .
In this speech , he essentially lays out the core strategy of Republicans that exists to this very day , their intention to hijack government and basically destroy it , creating an oligarchy where the politicians serve their rich masters and leave little more than crumbs for the bulk of society .
I 'm going to cite the text in full , because I think it 's important enough that it ought to be seen : Still today , Republicans are attempting the same goals with different instruments .
They mean to filibuster , they mean to write into law through signing statements , they mean to write executive orders , they mean to impeach , in the sense of the term meaning discredit , the New Deal , the women 's right to choose , universal health care , equal protection and civil rights , meaningful steps to mitigate the effects of global warming , any effort to curtail runaway defense spending and endless war , strong public education , global trade standards with respect for labor , the environment and human rights , indeed any progress in society at any level except the very very top .
The impeachment of Bill Clinton was a catalyzing event for the progressive movement .
It showed the power of the Republican noise machine to push their agenda to the most extreme lengths .
It was never all that clear that they expected removal from office , but it smeared the Clinton name just enough to hurt Al Gore so their candidate could steal the 2000 Election .
So in a sense everything springs from this one action , and all of the most rotten elements of the media , the Republican hypocrites and the desiccated Democratic response are on full display .
But as evidenced in Rep.
Jackson 's speech , there were a few honest men in that wilderness .
And if we continue to build and grow the progressive movement there will be more honest men , as the rot is cut out of the Democratic Party , as the backbone to stand up to Republican thievery becomes firmer , as the media gets called to account by a relentless blogosphere .
The consequences of passivity are great .
The consequences of active participation in taking back the government are real .
And this is what we must do .

Little Rissington - A History
RAF Little Rissington has stood in the English county of Gloucestershire since the 1930s and throughout this time it has served as home to the world famous Red Arrows and Red Pelicans as well as the Central Flying School .
While RAF Little Rissington was closed in 1994 , the airfield continues to be used by the MoD and various other associated sites are currently used by the HQAC and RAFC Cranwell .
It is also home to the 637 Volunteer Gliding Squadron who provide basic training for the Combined Cadet Force and Air Training Corps cadets and continues being used as an emergency landing strip , training area and is used for parachute training .
As World War 2 nears
All over the UK airfields were constructed as World War 2 loomed and Little Rissington was amongst their number .
Little Rissi , as it was affectionately known , began operating in 1938 just on the eve of the war , and thereafter the site underwent various stages of expansion during the war years with asphalt runways being laid which went through further developments later .
During the war RAF Little Rissington was home to No.6 Service Flying School and No.8 Maintenance Unit .
Post WW2 - Red Arrows and Red Pelicans
After the war in 1946 the Central Flying School moved to Little Rissington and it was during these post war years that the Red Pelicans and Red Arrows began using the expanding aerodrome .
Further changes
Between 1977 and 1979 Little Rissington became home to the army and was renamed Imjim Barracks when the Royal Irish Rangers arrived .
Then with the arrival of the United States Air Force in Europe , the site became Europe 's largest military contingency hospital that was on standby in the case of a major conflict , which was at its highest state of readiness during the first Gulf War .
The Americans left in 1993 and was finally given back to the RAF and became RAF Little Rissington once more .
Close to closure
It looked as if Little Rissingon 's account were closed in recent times when the Conservative Government put the whole site up for sale resulting in architects converting much of this historical aerodrome and associated buildings being transformed into a business and insurance park .
A change of heart
Thankfully a recent MoD review resulted in the preservation of the remaining parts of RAF Little Rissington much of which underwent refurbishment .
Sadly , though , it was too late for the control tower and several hangars which were demolished .
Upon agreement with the MoD a civilian aircraft maintenance firm moved in in 2006 and so Little Rissington 's distinguished association with aircraft continues , and so it seems it will continue to do so , at least until 2030 .
The site has been granted a Core RAF
Site status up to this time and it may well serve as a satellite base for other RAF bases scattered around the district .
Whatever the future of RAF Little Rissington , it will continue to be remembered as having played a distinguished role in the history of British aviation .
1956 was of course the worst year that the United States had ever faced .
Wracked by turmoil and social upheaval , beset by enemies within and without , the nation thrashed about like a dying , constipated beast .
Whole cities crumbled into ruin amid the chaos as American society teetered on the very brink of collapse .
The horror of that time has made the name of Eisenhower synonymous with anarchy even to this day .
My father would never talk about how he and his family survived those grim times .
Fortunately , in the very nick of time , legislators realized the true cause of the crisis : America ’s national motto was n’t stupid enough .
Like all of the country ’s other woes , this disaster could ultimately be traced back to that most sinister of Americans , Thomas Jefferson .
The same treacherous impulses that led him to betray his rightful King also inevitably prompted him to sabotage the fledgling nation by giving it the worst possible state motto : E pluribus unum .
Not only was this an unforgivably pompous classical reference , its subversive message -- “ out of many , one– ” would result in a catastrophic tradition of escalating tolerance and unity that was doomed to tear the country apart in less than two hundred years .
With Jefferson ’s nefarious plan finally revealed , the government was faced with the challenge of selecting a stupider , less tolerant motto to more accurately embody the national character .
A list was compiled of various candidates such as “ no loitering , ” “ if you ’re so smart why ai n’t you rich ? ” and “ whites only . ”
However , at last “ In God we trust , ” a judiciously recycled version of the Confederate States of America ’s motto “ God will vindicate , ” was chosen for its historical resonance , potential for divisiveness , and general inappropriateness .
Legislators also remarked favorably on its weirdly bass - ackwards phrasing , “ which calls to mind the speech of a comical Chinaman , or of some type of puppet from a science fiction serial of some kind . ”
The motto proved its worth immediately , as its blandly pious presence on American currency spurred an unparalleled economic boom , resulting in an age of renewed prosperity that lasted until the Carter years .
Yet now , five decades later , threats to America are on the rise once more .
There ’s the war on Christmas , of course ; and also Iraq ’s unprovoked invasion of the United States , which continues to cost the lives of American soldiers .
Iran and North Korea could launch a nuclear attack on American cities at any time , if indeed they have n’t already , and Mexicans continue to occur .
Is it once again time to safeguard ourselves with a new , even stupider motto ?
Perhaps “ In God and Jesus we trust really ; in fact their voices inside our heads we often hear , ” or “ are you ready for some football ? ! ”

High Crockalorum
Yesterday , Heidi W. sent in a note about the presentation that Dan Hodgins made to an Early Childhood Education group in her large urban school district ( " How big is your crockus ? " , 9/17/2007 ) .
Much of his talk was the standard stuff of current pop neuro - indoctrinology ( " science has revealed that boys ' brains are made of snips and snails and puppy - dog tails " ) , but one bit stuck out : the idea that a brain structure called " the crockus " is four times larger in girls than in boys .
Now , I 'm used to seeing the pop neuro - indoctrinologists misrepresenting or even inventing numbers , exaggerating differences , and generally misusing science to shore up weak arguments about social policy .
But this is the first time , as far as I know , that someone has actually made up a whole new brain area .
In fact , the idea that someone would actually fabricate " the crockus " as a neuro - anatomical neologism was so unexpected , so far beyond the boundaries of my imagination , that I misinterpreted Heidi 's note .
I thought " crockus " was her attempt to render some odd pronunciation that Hodgins used in his presentation .
But she quickly corrected me , and sent in a scan of ( parts ) of his handout , which was the take - away paper form of his PowerPoint slides .
Here 's the crucial slide :
His next slide tells us that ( because of their smaller Crockus ) " boys see the whole but not the details " .
He illustrated the role of Crockus by showing the audience a lateral view of the brain -- Heidi sent a scan of the handout version :
And she did a bit more research :
The drawing of the brain is not labeled on the handout , and it was n't labeled in Hodgins ' PowerPoint presentation , but the drawing indicates that it's from BrainConnection.com and I just located it here .
Hodgins referred to the small royal blue area , which is labeled " pars opercularis " on the web site PPslide , and he said that 's the size of the crockus in males , and he referred to the motor cortex ( somewhat lighter shade of blue ) and said that 's the size of the crockus in females .
This is truly strange stuff .
I feel like I 'm in a magic realist novel that 's slipped slightly out of editorial control .
But I have a theory .
Maybe back in 2003 , Prof .
Hodgins was talking with some of his drinking buddies , and the conversation went something like this :
Hodgins :
Those education professionals , they 're so worried about sex differences and so wowed by neuroscience , you can show 'em a picture of the brain and tell 'em any crazy thing about how brain scans show boys are different from girls .
And they not only believe it , they pay you .
Fly you out , nice hotel , per diem , the works .
Drinking Buddy # 1 : OK , they 're desperate and they 're credulous , but you got to make it plausible .
Hodgins : Nah , you take a random brain picture and any stupid made - up words and numbers , they 'll swallow it like ice cream .
Drinking Buddy # 2 : Come on .
You got to do a little reading , anyhow , you can't just tell them , oh , the " crockus " is four times bigger in girls and that 's how come they 're like better with details while us guys deal with the big picture .
Hodgins : Sure I could , absolutely .
Drinking Buddy # 1 : $ 500 says you 're full of it .
Hodgins : You 're on .
This theory is surely false .
Maybe Prof .
Hodgins just mis-remembered pars opercularis as crockus .
Or ....
No , I give up .
I 'll just spoil the joke , in my usual heavy - handed way , by citing what 's actually known about sex differences among school - age children in the brain region that Hodgins seems to have been talking about .
Let 's take a look at R.E. Blanton et al. , " Gender differences in the left inferior frontal gyrus " , Neuroimage , 22(2):626-636 , 2004 .
This study examined frontal lobe subregions in 46 normal children and adolescents ( 25 females , mean age : 11.08 , SD : 3.07 ; and 21 males , mean age : 10.76 , SD : 2.61 ) to assess the effects of age and gender on volumetric measures as well as hemispheric asymmetries .
Here 's their Fig. 8 " Gender Differences "
which they explain as follows :
Total intracranial volume , total gray matter , and total white matter were significantly larger in boys compared to girls ( F = 11.63 , P = 0.001 ; F = 16.17 , P < 0.001 ; F = 9.59 , P = 0.004 , respectively ) .
In addition , total left gray matter volume was found to be significantly larger in boys ( F = 7.58 , P = 0.009 ) .
After covarying for total intracranial volume , male subjects were found to have more gray matter in the left IFG ( F = 9.14 , P = 0.004 ) , a trend for a significantly larger left IFG relative to girls ( F = 6.38 , P = 0.016 ) , and a trend for increased asymmetry in total right white matter as compared to total left ( F = 6.24 , P = 0.017 ) .
Let me point out here , again , that the distributions are heavily overlapped , and that most of the subjects are in the overlapped region .
The sex differences are interesting and worth further study , but it 's nuts to prescribe on the basis of such evidence that our educational systems needs to treat boys and girls as if they were completely separate species .
[ Update -- Since the pars opercularis and the pars triangularis together form Broca 's area , several readers have suggested that perhaps it was Hodgins who misheard " Broca 's " as " Crockus " .
This occurred to me as well -- and also to Heidi W. -- but we were all wrong .
I wrote to Dan Hodgins , asking
Someone who recently heard you speak asked if I could explain your reference to a part of the brain called the " Crockus " , which is four times larger in girls than in boys , and is apparently involved in explaining differences in attention to detail .
I could n't find any information on the web about a part of the brain by that name .
Can you help ?
Prof .
Hodgins was kind enough to reply very quickly :
Thanks for asking .... The Crockus was actually just recently named by Dr. Alfred Crockus .
It is the detailed section of the brain , a part of the frontal lope .
It is the detailed section of the brain .
You are right , it is four times larger in females then males from birth .
This part of the brain supports the Corpus Callosum ( the part of the brain that connects the right and left hemisphere .
The larger the crockus the more details are percieved by the two sides of the brain .
For boys , usually they only view and analyze the whole picture , not the sum of its details .
Girls brains are wired to look at the details first , which then leads them to the whole picture .
Look at the work by Moir .
This deepens the mystery , I think , because I can't find any likely - looking Alfred Crockus via Google Scholar or Wikipedia or even general web search .
I think that the " Moir " he 's referring to is the co-author of Anne Moir and David Jessel , Brainsex , 1992 .
But Amazon offers its " Search Inside " feature for that work , and a search for " Crockus " in it comes up empty .
I 've written back to Prof .
Hodgins for more information . ]

I caught up with the venerable Erik Meijer recently to discuss functional programming languages , academic versus real - world application of functional programming languages ( there are very good reasons why people do n't program Windows applications in , say , Haskell ... ) and , well , Erik .
Why does Erik work here ?
What 's his history ?
Of course , as an academic type ( he also ships software so he 's not purely academic ... ) , Erik is a big fan of strict functional or pure functional , as it were .
This is a deep interview and Erik spends most of the time on the whiteboard .
Enjoy .
There 's lots to learn in this one ... For those who are bandwidth challenged , here 's a low res version for download
News flash :
If you are neither on , nor in need of , attention - deficit medication … you ’re probably at a serious disadvantage marketing your business online .
I ’m not judging anyone here — I ’m just making an observation .
A few weeks ago , I was sitting at a big sloppy banquet hosted by one of the top online entrepreneurs .
Very nice restaurant , and we had a back room all to ourselves .
Seated around me were a dozen other rich , respected online entrepreneurs — mostly men in their thirties , and one or two women in the same age group .
Everywhere you turned , there was another fun and invigorating conversation going on .
I really like my colleagues in the online marketing world .
And I appreciate the fact that , while I ’m much older ( and I ’ve been around the block about a thousand more times ) , we all have so much in common that we treat each other like equals .
Which mostly means we engage freely in totally uncensored conversations that are hilarious , revealing , and often amazingly profitable .
At this particular dinner , however , I had a sudden realization … and was able to field - test it immediately with the people sitting around me .
That realization was this :
While we have much in common as marketers and advertisers and just being cutting - edge creative types … we ALSO share another trait that I almost NEVER used to see in the pre-Web days of direct response advertising .
Once I tell you what this trait is , it will seem obvious .
But few of us have ever put a finger on it before .
Wanna guess what this trait is that so many online entrepreneurs share ?
It ’s …
… being a misfit .
And not just a run -of - the - mill misfit , either .
I started asking my table - mates , point blank , if they had ever been diagnosed with ADHD ( attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ) , OCD ( obsessive / compulsive disorder ) , or any of the other less common “ social outsider ” categories that doctors seem to love using to catalog people .
Everyone started sharing their private histories … and it was eye - opening .
I ’m not gonna name names here .
( Insiders will probably be able to guess who I ’m talking about … but then , they probably also share the same diagnosis . )
I just think this is an important insight to online marketing success .
There were brilliant people at this table … and at least one honest genius , IQ - wise .
There were technical wizards , stunningly talented thinkers , writers with breathtaking talent , and lots of super - savvy guys who had learned to “ game ” the online system so massive quantities of moolah flowed in their direction .
Often with little extra work .
And yet , in the offline world , nearly all of them would be STRUGGLING to hold down a regular job … or , in some cases , possibly forced out of “ polite ” socieity altogether .
These people were misfits .
Literally , they did n’t FIT in the mainstream world very well at all .
Some of the brightest ones had common memories of being forced into “ special needs ” classes in school .
Many were dropouts , because their intelligence was overlooked and understimulated .
For the ones who were most successful … the birth of the Web presented SALVATION .
Many started online as gamers — staying up late ( or for days at a time ) dodging dragons and shooting aliens , sharing the new fantasy worlds with an ever - growing community of other misfits .
They got to know each other , started exploring the capitalist possibilities of the Web , and traded in games for marketing .
While the Web frightened and confused traditional businesses , these younger guys were fearless about code , software , building sites and everything else in the new virtual world - wide city center .
I got into freelance copywriting because I was a notoriously bad fit in the corporate world .
I ca n’t stand wearing ties ( they literally chafe my neck ) , and I ’m a flagrant night owl — which , I have now discovered , is something else I share with many of the best online entrepreneurs out there .
As far as I know , I do not have any attention deficit problems … yet , I can enjoy long and chaotic conversations with the worst of them , and I even enjoy the non-linear thinking .
So , I dunno , maybe I ’m ADHD , too .
Can you have a mild case of it ?
Actually , I kinda doubt it really exists .
Getting to know these brilliant , wacky online entrepreneurs leads me to believe that — in the bad old pre-Web days — there simply was n’t a place for them .
“ Normal ” society hates misfits , cuz we make uptight people uncomfortable .
( I ’ve been fired from almost every “ real ” job I ’ve ever had . )
( With good reason , too — I refused to play by stupid rules , and I still consider the REAL insane people to be the ones who surrender their individuality to The Man for a paycheck . )
The Web has nurtured a fabulous explosion of entrepreneurial opportunity … and now smart misfits can work their own hours , dressed however they like , from chaotic home offices , doing whatever funky project they dream up .
You can make your own rules , and change them daily .
You can obsess to your heart ’s content , or be as lazy and distracted as you like ( once you ’ve set your systems in place ) and still rake it in .
The entire playing field has changed , drastically .
In traditional corporate environments , the people who rise to positions of authority and power ( and high salaries ) are often the jerks who know how to play “ the game ” at work .
Kiss ass , take credit for other people ’s efforts , avoid responsibility for failure , stab co-workers in the back , etc .
The biz - as - usual soap opera .
Online , however , you ’re essentially naked except for your brain .
There ’s no corporate game to play … and none of the skills that normally shoot a person up the ladder are relevant .
Online , being good looking , or suave , or a good worker , or even likeable wo n’t win you any victories .
Online , the misfits have the advantage .
They can create their own attention paradigms , set their own standards , and take their biz directly to people who want what they offer … with nary an intervening newspaper , magazine , television standards and practices attorney , politician , store shelf position , billboard or sweet talking salesman to harsh anyone ’s mellow .
I do n’t know if anyone else has fully understood the implications here .
Maybe I ’m slow getting on the band wagon … but the other entrepreneurs I ’ve talked to have all agreed that no one ’s really noticed how many true misfits there are at the top of the online world .
There ’s room for everybody , of course .
But I think I now see why so many wannabe entrepreneurs I counsel are having trouble getting traction onine — they need to get in touch with their Inner Misfit .
It ’s a brave new world … and I , for one , welcome it .
Misfits of the world , unite !
And stay frosty ,

An article on http://theregister.co.uk reported that Facebook experienced its first drop in monthly viewership since its inception .
This got me thinking about Facebook and its proposed $ 15 billion pricetag .
I , for one , think the valuation of Facebook at anything near $ 15B is completely ridiculous .
It seems this is a repeat of recent history , where clicks / user was a better valuation metric than profit / user .
With a valuation of $ 15B , it would mean that Facebook is worth more than General Motors , Xerox corp , or Starbucks .
Stated another way , you could theoretically buy , outright , any of the three companies previously listed .
I think this should be a warning sign to any tech investor to STAY AWAY from the company that picks up Facebook , because its gonna be a train wreck .
My case in point is Ebay .
As some of you may know , Ebay purchased Skype for ‘ only ’ $ 2.6 Billion in 2005 .
Since then , Ebay has n’t found a way to make their money back , and ended up writing off $ 1.4 Billion of that purchase almost exactly a year later .
Ebay closed at $ 46.75 in January ’ 06 , and has been dropping ever since .
In the beginning of Feb . ’ 08 , Ebay has been hovering around the $ 27 , which equates to a 42 % drop in 2 years .
The best part about it is that Skype actually makes money !
They have subscribers and a per minute charge for their land line functionality !
Facebook has loads of users , but do they pay a subscription ?
Not a chance .
This brings me to my next point : how do you monetize Facebook ?
Facebook effectively provides a novelty service .
It ’s a service that people find interesting , but it ’s not something that they need to survive on the internet .
When compared against a service like Google ’s search , or Gmail , or Google Maps , it starts to look pretty ridiculous .
There are probably not many people who would pay a subscription to view Facebook , unless it unlocked hidden profiles or something of that nature .
So they are left to use advertising .
Advertising works great when you have lots of eyeballs , but you have to think about conversion rates .
What percentage of users actually click on a link ?
My guess is that it is really low .. and although it provides a consistent revenue stream , its hardly the moneymaker that our comparison GM or Starbucks could make .
I find the valuation of Facebook and Myspace intriguing , because it really seems like investors have forgotten about the internet boom .
The same exact thing is happening , and investors seem to simply want to jump on the next bandwagon so bad that they do n’t stop to think for a moment about where that bandwagon is headed .
I think it is safe to say that social networking is an interesting fad , and while it is not going to disappear , it certainly does n’t seem to have the staying power that justifies a $ 15 billion price tag .
My warning to you investor types is to steer clear of whatever company tries to digest Facebook , because its not going to turn out well in the end .

“ IS it that time already ? ” “ Every year it gets earlier ! ” “ Please !
No tinsel !
Not before December ! ”
These are just some of the comments I overheard recently as passers - by saw me and my colleagues installing the holiday windows at the emporium of style and fashion where we work .
We are old hands at ignoring sidewalk commentary .
We usually just carry on with our glue - gunning and our decoupage - ing .
But this year the Greek chorus of surprise reached such a pitch that I feel compelled to respond and set the record straight .
Brace yourselves .
You may be shocked by what I am about to tell you .
Holiday promotions kick off at exactly the same time every year !
Let me , a window dresser with more than 30 years of experience , assure you of the following : Dasher and Blitzen and Mrs. Claus and all the elves of the world have been working from the same notes , and the same schedule , for as long as we all can remember .
Here ’s how the season unfolds :
First come the holiday ornament shops .
Some gauche folks unveil these bauble - filled boutiques right after Labor Day , but most opt for the middle of October .
Next we have the interior decorations , the festooning of which takes place around Halloween at some Manhattan department stores .
Others , demonstrating a certain chic restraint , usually wait until at least Nov. 2 or 3 before decking their halls .
In pictures : Big beards and mighty moustaches
Competitors in the World Beard and Moustache Championships paraded through Brighton on Saturday morning .
German contestant Elmar Weiser displayed a structurally impressive beard .
The Dali moustache category specifies " slender with long tips , straight up or arching up " .
Wax is an important tool of the trade for many of the facial hair creations .
Willi Chevalier , from Germany , was entering the Full Beard Freestyle category .
The championships are held every two years with German and American contestants often dominating .
Brighton 's Royal Alexandra Children 's Hospital will share in the event 's proceeds this year .
Competition organisers arranged sightseeing tours of Sussex before and after the main event .
Gandhi Jones travelled from Seattle in America to enter the Moustache Freestyle category .
Contestant David Traver is from Alaska , where the 2009 championships will be staged .

What are these ?
For them , that means rising from their street - side slumber around 3 a.m. to start sifting through recycling bins outside people ’s homes or in front of buildings .
( For the record , paperbacks are recyclable ; the city requires the covers to be removed from hardcovers before they can be recycled , a request that for booklovers is tantamount to asking 10 - year - old girls to rip Barbie ’s head off before discarding her in the trash . )
The two 50 - ish men  Tommy Books and Leprechaun , they call themselves  are often the first people waiting on the Strand ’s bookselling line , a queue also populated by N.Y.U. students , genteel booklovers moving to smaller apartments , frugal cleaner - outers , and a fair number of down - and - out fellow book scavengers , many of whom live on the street .
Hundreds of men and a smaller number of women eke out a living scavenging books in Manhattan , according to Mitchell Duneier , author of “ Sidewalk , ” a book about the subculture of sidewalk book scavengers and vendors .
Some of them sell their books on the street ; others , the less entrepreneurial , or the more impatient , go for the surefire cash at the Strand .
When the store opened that Monday morning , Tommy Books and Leprechaun each in turn emptied their boxes onto the counter , where Neil Winokur , a Strand employee , quickly sorted them into two piles .
An incomplete encyclopedia got rejected , as did Donna Tartt ’s “ Secret History . ”
( Too many on the market . )
An hour or two later , another scavenger scored a hit selling the store a supply of children ’s books , but had no luck with Newt Gingrich ’s “ Winning the Future ” ( “ No one buys him here , ” said Mr. Winokur ) .
Around lunchtime , Neil Harrison , another regular who ’s lived mostly on the street , showed up with a stash of leather - bound 19th - century books , their marbleized covers aswirl with greens and blues .
He said that a building superintendent had allowed him to clear out a storage area used by a man who had died whose family did not want the books .
Mr. Harrison did n’t know the authors 
Thackeray , Gibbon  but he knew enough to know that the books had value .
イントラネットを対象としたテストを数年ぶりに実施したところ、前回のテスト以来、イントラネットユーザビリティが劇的に向上してきたことが実感できた。
われわれが用いるもっとも単純なユーザビリティ指標は、成功率である。これは、そのユーザーインターフェースを通じてユーザがタスクを完了できるかどうかを示す割合だ。前回の調査では、成功率の平均は74％だったが、今回の調査では80％になった。74％から80％への上昇は大した変化ではないように見えるかもしれないが、前回の数値がすでにかなり高い割合だったので、そこからさらにアップするというのは大変なことだ。
通常の公開インターネットでテストすると、その成功率はイントラネットの場合より格段に低くなってしまう。われわれの著書
『 Prioritizing Web Usability 』 では、ユーザにウェブでタスクを実行してもらう際に、特定のサイトを出発点として指定せずにテストを行った場合の詳しい結果を紹介している。そのようなタスクを実行させると、世間一般のウェブの利用パターンがテストできるのだが、その場合の成功率は60％にしか達しなかった。
イントラネットでの成功率が、大抵はインターネットの場合より約33％も高いのは、以下の2つの理由による：
イントラネットの場合、 行き先に迷うことはあり得ない 。その企業のイントラネットは唯一無二である ―― インターネットでは起こりうるように、詐欺まがいのサイトや信頼性の低い情報源に行き着いたのではないかという心配は無用なのだ。インターネットを利用する上で最初に課題となるのは、自分が解決しようとしている疑問にちゃんと答えてくれるサイトを見つけられるかどうかだが、イントラネットではそういう障壁もない。（確かにイントラネットでも自分の進路を見出す必要はあるが、それはインターネットのサイト内ナビゲーションを行うことに相当するので、サイト自体を探し出すことやそれが悪質なサイトでないかを判断することとは別だ。）
。その企業のイントラネットは唯一無二である ―― インターネットでは起こりうるように、詐欺まがいのサイトや信頼性の低い情報源に行き着いたのではないかという心配は無用なのだ。インターネットを利用する上で最初に課題となるのは、自分が解決しようとしている疑問にちゃんと答えてくれるサイトを見つけられるかどうかだが、イントラネットではそういう障壁もない。（確かにイントラネットでも自分の進路を見出す必要はあるが、それはインターネットのサイト内ナビゲーションを行うことに相当するので、サイト自体を探し出すことやそれが悪質なサイトでないかを判断することとは別だ。）
企業にとってイントラネットは1つだけなので、イントラネットの利用経験を積む従業員の数は増え続けていく。それに対してインターネット一般では、ユーザはサイトの垣根を越えて飛び回り、一つのサイトにそれほど留まりはしない。したがって、個々のサイトのインターフェース事情を理解してくれることはめったにないので、その分サイト内でまごつくことも多くなる。
今回調査したイントラネットでの成功率のバラつきは、前回に比べて相当小さかった。平均値に対する標準偏差は、前回の調査では15％だったが、今回は8％に過ぎなかった。言い換えると、この一般的尺度に従うなら、イントラネットの変動性はほぼ半減したということだ。これは、イントラネット向けユーザビリティガイドラインによる恩恵を一段と明らかにする事実である。
前回の調査は、世の中にイントラネット向けのガイドラインが存在しなかった頃に実施したものだった。（この初めての調査の目的こそ、イントラネット向けユーザビリティガイドラインの初版に含めるべき項目を洗い出すことに他ならなかった。）その手のガイドラインがなかったため、デザイナーは自分が手がけるイントラネットに限定された観察結果に頼るしかなく、他のイントラネットで見出されたユーザビリティ上の発見を活かすことができなかった。そんな風にユーザビリティにまつわるノウハウが乏しかったせいで、デザイン上の判断に大きなバラつきが出てしまっていたのだ。
それに対してこの2回目の調査は、初回の調査報告に基づく全般的なイントラネット向けユーザビリティガイドラインを発行した後で実施した。この一段と幅広いノウハウを基にサイトを作ることで、各企業が社内で入手できる情報についての格差が縮まったのだ。ただし、イントラネットのデザインチームに割り当てられたリソースは一様ではなく、デザイン上の判断が異なればその影響にも差が出るので、多少のバラつきがまだ残っていたのは言うまでもない。
しかし全体的に見れば、イントラネットのユーザビリティについての知識が増えるほど、イントラネットのデザインは当てずっぽうな作業ではなくなる。このガイドラインの新しいバージョンでは、もっと詳細な分析結果を示したりガイドライン項目を追加することで、イントラネットの品質のバラつきをさらに減らすことができればと考えている。
イントラネットのユーザ調査
われわれはイントラネットのユーザビリティについて国際的な調査を2回に渡って実施し、27社の企業の社員を対象に28回のユーザーテストを行った（そのうち1社については2回のテストを行ったことになる。米国内の本社と、他国にある支社でテストを実施し、多国対応しているイントラネットでの国際的なユーザビリティについて情報を集めたのだ）。
このテストは米国（20回）、ヨーロッパ（6回）、アジア（1回）、カナダ（1回）で行われた。最初の2002年の調査では、ラボを利用した従来型のユーザビリティテストを重視していた。2回目の調査では、初回と同様のラボでのタスクの多くを再度テストし、イントラネットの利用についての最近の変化を視野に入れた新たなタスクを追加し、フィールド調査まで含めることになった。
われわれはどのテストでも、調査対象とする企業や組織の現場に出向いて、従業員の代表にテストへ参加してもらい、イントラネットのユーザ調査を実施した。ラボでのテストセッションでは、イントラネットでよく見られる様々な利用パターンをカバーする一連の標準的なタスクを実行するよう、ユーザに指示した。あらかじめ準備した一定のタスクを課すことで、各社のイントラネットにおけるユーザビリティの達成度を比較したり、2回の調査の間にユーザビリティがどう変化したかを計測することができる。
フィールド調査のセッションでは、従業員の代表が通常の業務を行う様子を観察した。できるだけ口をはさまないようにして、特定のタスクを課すこともしなかった。このセッションの間にユーザがイントラネットで行った操作は、企業ごとに明らかにかなりの違いが見られ、形式的な比較が難しかった。だが、それでもフィールド調査はこの上なく貴重な結果をもたらす。ラボでの観察よりはるかに幅広いユーザ行動を観察できるし、利用状況などのエスノグラフィ要因の変化による影響を計ることができるからだ。
イントラネットのユーザビリティに関する知識の増加
以下に示すのは、これら2回の調査の成果として発行したレポート『Intranet Usability Guidelines』の比較表である：
初版 第 2 版 テストしたイントラネットの件数 14 ※ 27 レポートのページ数 231 1,160 デザインガイドラインの項目数
111 614 スクリーンショットの枚数 164 701
※ うち1社については、多国対応イントラネットの国際的ユーザビリティに関して追加情報を集めるため、
2カ国でテストを行った。その結果、27組織で28回のテストによるデータを得たことになる。
調査対象が2倍になっただけなのに、ユーザビリティに関するガイドラインはなぜ5倍にまで増えたのだろうか？
いくつかの理由が考えられる：
われわれは、情報公開できるこれら28回のイントラネットのテストの他にも、コンサルティングを引き受けているクライアントのイントラネットでもっと多くの調査を行っている。また、毎年発行しているレポート『Intranet Design Annual』の一部として 、 1,000件を超えるイントラネットのデザインを分析している 。これらさらに多数のイントラネットの仕様は公にはできないものの、その研究成果からは数々の一般的教訓を導くことができる。
。これらさらに多数のイントラネットの仕様は公にはできないものの、その研究成果からは数々の一般的教訓を導くことができる。
最初の調査は、ユーザビリティガイドラインの一般法則を見出そうという目標に向けて、多数のイントラネットに渡るユーザビリティを体系的にテストしようとした 史上初の試み であった。過去に前例がなかったため、この初調査を計画し実践するのは今より難しく、イントラネットユーザビリティに関する最大の問題を見きわめることに的を絞らねばならなかった。それに比べると、今では
ずっと頑丈な土台ができあがっている ので、より幅広い問題を見つけ出し、レポートしやすくなった。概念的な枠組みがあるべき場所に存在していれば、調査に基づく研究も一段と実り多いものになる。

が組み込まれている。調査対象とする機能が増えるほど、ユーザビリティ上の課題もより多く見つかることになる。
イントラネットのユーザビリティは向上している。したがってユーザはさらに先まで進み、よりハイレベルな操作を行おうとする。それ自体は喜ばしいことだが、より多くのことを達成しようとするほど、初歩的な問題でつまずいていた頃にはそれほど目に付かなかった、新たなユーザビリティ上の課題に出くわすことになる。
イントラネットのユーザビリティ指標の改善
この調査ではイントラネットでよく行う18種類のタスクをテストしたが、そのうち11種類では初回の調査と同じことが繰り返された。この事実から、2回の調査の間にユーザの生産性がどれくらい変化したかを見積もることができる。
以下のグラフは、ユーザビリティのレベルが3段階に異なるイントラネットのそれぞれにおける動向を示している：
Q1 （第1 四分位数）： タスク実行時間が少ない順に見て、上位の25％と下位の75％の境界となる数値。ユーザビリティのレベルが高いイントラネットでタスクを実行するのにかかると予想される時間。
（ 第1四分位数） ： タスク実行時間が少ない順に見て、上位の25％と下位の75％の境界となる数値。ユーザビリティのレベルが高いイントラネットでタスクを実行するのにかかると予想される時間。 中央値 （第2四分位数）： タスク実行時間が少ない順に見て、上位の50％と下位の50％の境界となる数値。平均的なユーザビリティを備えたイントラネットでタスクを実行するのにかかると予想される時間。
（ 第2四分位数） ： タスク実行時間が少ない順に見て、上位の50％と下位の50％の境界となる数値。平均的なユーザビリティを備えたイントラネットでタスクを実行するのにかかると予想される時間。
Q3（第3四分位数）： タスク実行時間が少ない順に見て、上位の75％と下位の25％の境界となる数値。ユーザビリティのレベルが低いイントラネットでタスクを実行するのにかかると予想される時間。
2回のユーザ調査のいずれでもテストした11種類の一般的なイントラネットでのタスクを、平均レベルの従業員が実行するのにかかる一年当たりの時間数。
上のライン（ 赤 ）は、イントラネット全体のうち 下位の（実行速度が遅い ） 25 ％ でのタスク実行時間を 、

このグラフから、2つの結論が明らかとなる：
イントラネットのユーザビリティは著しく向上しており、 より迅速なタスクの実行 と、それによる従業員の生産性向上に結びついている。よりスピーディに利用できるイントラネットのおかげで節約できる時間を、彼らは“本来の”業務を行うことに向けることができる。真ん中のレベルのイントラネットの場合、 生産性が44％向上している 。
と、それによる従業員の生産性向上に結びついている。よりスピーディに利用できるイントラネットのおかげで節約できる時間を、彼らは“本来の”業務を行うことに向けることができる。真ん中のレベルのイントラネットの場合、
。 もっとも劇的な改善が見られたのは、ユーザビリティのレベルが低いイントラネットであり、生産性が69％も向上している。ユーザビリティのレベルが高いイントラネットも改善されてはいるが、そこまでには及ばない。
今後もイントラネットユーザビリティの費用対効果は見込めるのか？
このようにイントラネットがより使いやすくなってきたとすれば、企業は今後もイントラネットユーザビリティの改善に投資し続ける必要があるのだろうか？
この疑問について考える手段として、従業員によるイントラネットの利用時間コストを見てみよう。
2回目の調査でテストした、イントラネットでよく行われる18種類のタスクについての時間的コストは、タスク実行にかかる1年当たりの時間数にその従業員の雇用コストを掛け算して求められる。各企業ごとの給与水準と間接経費に基づいてそれぞれの数値を算出することもできるが、話をわかりやすくするために、一律に1時間当たり30ドルとして計算しよう。この数値は、アメリカ合衆国の事務労働者の1時間当たりの平均賃金に50％の間接経費を上乗せした金額に相当する。
以下の表は、10,000名のイントラネットユーザを抱える企業でこれら18種類のタスクを実行した場合の所要時間の年間コストを示している：
イントラネットのユーザビリティ コスト 高レベル （Q1 ） 750 万 ドル／年 平均レベル（中央値） 990 万 ドル／年 低レベル （Q3 ） 1,290万ドル／年
すなわち、イントラネットユーザビリティのレベルが低い企業なら、それを平均レベルに引き上げることで年間300万ドルの節約になる。また、イントラネットユーザビリティが平均レベルにある企業なら、上位25％に食い込めるようなレベルまで改善を図れば、年間240万ドルの節約になると言える。
これらの数値は、われわれがテストした一般的なタスクにおける生産性を測るものでしかない。ほとんどの企業ではこれらのタスク以外に、各社特有のミッションクリティカルなタスクが行われている。それは当然ながら他の組織と共通のテスト対象にはできないが、従業員の業務効率全般に対して、一般的なタスクより大きな影響を及ぼすのが普通だ。そのため大部分の企業では、イントラネットユーザビリティの改善によって得られる全体的な生産性は、先ほど見積もった数値の何倍も大きくなる。
初回の調査でテストした一般的タスクは、16種類だった。当時の見積りでは、従業員10,000名の企業でイントラネットユーザビリティを改善した場合に得られる生産性を次のように算出した：
低レベルから平均レベルへの改善で1,000万ドル／年、平均レベルから高レベルへの改善で500万ドル／年である。
2回の調査でテストしたタスクの種類が一部異なるため、生産性の向上を直接比べるのは難しいが、全体像として確実に見えてくるのはこういうことだ：
イントラネットユーザビリティの改善による生産性向上の割合は、昔よりずっと小さくなっている。
これは何も驚くべき事実ではない ―― イントラネットユーザビリティにおける最悪の間違いはもう根絶してきたので、ことわざに言う“ 手の届く果実 ” はほぼ収穫済みだからである。
したがって、近年見られた大幅なイントラネットユーザビリティの改善についてのネガティブな面として、これからは今までと同じような伸びしろがないことが挙げられる。
では、ここでもうリングにタオルを投げ入れて、世の中のイントラネットを現状レベルのユーザビリティで落ち着かせておけばよいのか？
まったくそんなことはない。
イントラネットユーザビリティを改善する継続的努力の必要性を主張すべきなのは、次の3つの理由による：
イントラネットでの一般的なタスクについては 年間200万ドルから300万ドルの生産性向上 が、企業固有のタスクについてはその数倍の向上が見込まれる。
一方、例として挙げた従業 員10,000 名の企業の場合、イントラネットユーザビリティ関連プロジェクトにかかるコストは50万ドルに満たないのが普通だ。企業の規模が大きくなるほど費用もかさむが、生産性もそれに比例して上昇することが分かるだろう。従業員100,000名の企業なら、イントラネットの改善で10倍のメリットが生じるはずだが、それを実現させる予算は4倍程度で済むはずだ（つまり、200万ドルの投資に対して2,000万ドルから3,000万ドルのリターンが得られる見込みとなる）。

“ 高レベルのイントラネットユーザビリティ”については、理論上最適と考えられるデザインではなく、現存するベストプラクティスのみを対象とした。このQ1の数値がイントラネットユーザビリティのファイナルアンサーを示していると思い込むのはナンセンスだ。各企業がイントラネットのデザインの現状を打破し続けるなら、さらなる改善が見込めるだろう。毎年『Intranet Design Annual』を発表してきた経験から見て、この点については大いに楽観視している。選りすぐりのイントラネットの数々でさえも、年々一段と改善されつつあるからだ。
つまりあらゆる面から見て言えることだが、イントラネットユーザビリティ関連プロジェクトは、たとえその企業初のプロジェクトで達成したほど大幅な改善は見込めなくても、引き続きすぐれたROIを実現するはずだ。
良くなってはいるが、まだ十分ではない
イントラネットユーザビリティが実質的に改善されてきたのは間違いない。しかし、もはや申し分ない状況だと言えるだろうか？
それはノーである。われわれがイントラネットユーザビリティの改善に着手した当時、それはとんでもなくレベルの低い、インターネットの一般サイトのひ弱な従兄弟のようなものだった。企業はデザインやユーザビリティに投資などしていなかったし、ナビゲーションやIAはまるっきりのカオス状態だった。だが今では事態は大いに進展した ―― イントラネット開発チームの77％は、管理部門から十分な支援を受けているそうだ。しかしほとんどの企業において、イントラネットでのユーザーエクスペリエンスは、従業員の生産性を最大化するのに必要なレベルにはまだまだ達していない。

Yvonne Bray , took her daughters Gemma , 15 , and Katie , 13 , to New York shortly after Christmas for a shopping trip but was taken into hospital when she fell ill with pneumonia during their visit .
The girls were then told they could not wait at the hospital and as minors would have to be taken into care .
Social workers took them to a municipal orphanage in downtown Manhattan , where they were separated , strip - searched and questioned before being kept under lock and key for the next 30 hours .
The two sisters were made to shower in front of security staff and told to fill out a two - page form with questions including : " Have you ever been the victim of rape ? " and " Do you have homicidal tendencies ? "
One question asked " are you in a street gang ? " to which Gemma replied : " I'm a member of Appledore library . "
Their clothes , money and belongings were taken and they were issued with regulation white T - shirt and jeans .
Katie said : " It was like being in a little cage .
I tried to go to sleep , but every time I opened my eyes , someone was looking right at me . "
Eventually Bray discharged herself , and - still dressed in hospital pyjamas - tracked down the girls .
She said : " It is absolutely horrendous that two young girls were put through an ordeal like that .
They were made to answer traumatic questions about things they do n't really understand and spend over 24 hours under surveillance . "
Since returning home , Bray has received a letter from the US Administration for Children and Families , notifying her that , because the children were admitted to the orphanage , she is now " under investigation . "

Giuliani on the Set of Cabaret
Material - support cases are just a small fraction of what the Justice Department counts as terrorism prosecutions , and in the larger picture the government is not doing nearly as well .
According to the Center on Law and Security at the New York University School of Law , the government has a 29 percent conviction rate in terrorism prosecutions overall , compared with 92 percent for felonies generally .
Image Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman , the blind cleric found guilty in 1995 of conspiring to wage war against the United States .

In the trial that ended on Monday with a mix of acquittals and deadlocks , the Holy Land Foundation and several of its officials were charged with giving money to Hamas , the militant Palestinian organization designated a terrorist group by the United States in 1995 .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation started looking into Holy Land in 1993 .
Legal experts said it could be hard to prosecute cases in which some of the evidence was quite old .
Indeed , much of the evidence had been available to prosecutors in the Clinton Justice Department , and the material support law was enacted in 1996 .
But those prosecutors did not pursue the matter .
“ There are some of these cases that we did not push — certainly aggressively , sometimes not at all — because we were in a different mindset before 9/11 , ” said Andrew C. McCarthy , who led the 1995 prosecution of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman , the blind cleric convicted of conspiring to wage war against the United States .
William Neal , a juror in the Holy Land case , complained that the government ’s evidence “ was pieced together over the course of a decade — a phone call this year , a message another year . ”
Instead of trying to prove that the defendants knew they were supporting terrorists , Mr. Neal said , prosecutors “ danced around the wire transfers by showing us videos of little kids in bomb belts and people singing about Hamas , things that did n’t directly relate to the case . ”
The Great Depression - 2008 Forecasters Still Getting it Wrong
As the Australian and US booms rolls on some ' forecaster ' , particularly on the net , are once again drawing historical analogies , warning that we risk a financial collapse that could bring on a depression every bit as bad as the 1930s .
These forecasters know as much about the Great Depression as I do about brain surgery .
Unfortunately , journalists ' ignorance of economic history is massive .
As we all know , ignorance never stopped journalists from expressing their opinions , especially when it comes to economics .
This brings me to Alan Wood , The Australian 's economics commentator who wrote about the dismal fate of the " US economic forecasting industry " that flourished in the 1920s ( Dangerous complacency increases investors ' appetite for risk , 22 January 2005 ) .
It was their " failure to see the depression coming [ that ] put them out of business , " wrote Mr Wood .
Relying on J. K. Galbraith 's The Great Crash 1929
Wood relates how Harvard Economic Service 's forecasts failed to warn business of the impending depression .
Even in November 1929 it declared " a severe depression like that of 1920 - 21 is outside the range of probability .
We are not facing protracted liquidation . " ( Galbraith ) .
The preceding , according to Wood , is " a prudent reminder of the fallibility of forecasts at a time of the year when the voices of economic and market prognosticators are loud in the land . "
But is it ?
Any journalist who relies on Galbraith 's account of the " Great Crash " deserves the sack .
His book is a shallow and misleading work that lacks any permanent value .
( The classic work is Murray N. Rothbard 's America 's Great Depression , Richardson & Snyder , New York City .
There is also Benjamin M. Anderson 's Economics and the Public Welfare , LibertyPress , Indianapolis 1979 .
Then there is Amity Shlaes ' The Forgotten Man : A New History of the Great Depression , Harper Collin 2007 ) .
What our economic pundits do not know is that during the ‘ 20s some economists did warn that a severe depression was unavoidable .
In the summer of 1929 , for instance , Ludwig von Mises refused an important job at the Kreditanstalt Bank because , as he told his fiancé , " A great crash is coming , and I do n't want my name in any way connected with it . "
( Margit von Mises My Years with Ludwig von Mises , Arlington House , 1976 , p. 31 ) .
Mises had been warning for years that the central banks ' loose monetary policies would bring on a depression .
Likewise , Friedrich von Hayek warned that the US economy was heading for a crash .
Writing for the Austrian Institute of Economic Research Report , February 1929 , he successfully predicted that " the boom will collapse within the next few months . "
Hayek were no alone in their dire warnings .
Roger Babson , a well - known Boston financial adviser , was warning investors in September 1929 of an imminent crash .
E. C. Harwood , founder of the American Institute for Economic Research , and Benjamin M. Anderson , chief economist at Chase National Bank , were also warning that a crash was unavoidable .
The brilliant Mr Keynes was not so prophetic .
Felix Somary , a Swiss banker , related how Keynes had approached him in the mid-20s for stock recommendations .
Somary , who subscribed to the Austrian School of economics , refused to give him any , warning that a speculative bubble was emerging .
Keynes confidently replied : " There will be no more crashes in our lifetime . "
The financial collapse apparently did nothing to dent his self - confidence .
( Cited in Dissent on Keynes , edited by Mark Skousen , Praeger , 1992 , p. 163 ) .
Once the depression was underway Keynes still hailed the price stabilization scheme that caused it as a " triumph . "
When it suited him , Keynes ' conceit apparently left him unfazed by mere facts .
On the other hand , D. H. Robertson who had been a supporter of the Fed 's monetary policy began to have serious doubts about it after the depression stuck .
It is therefore not a question of unsound forecasting but of unsound economics .
Under the influence of Irving Fisher virtually the whole of the American economics profession had fallen prey , and still has , to the fallacy that a stable price level means there is no inflation .
( Sir Ralph Hawtrey was one of the guiding lights of this fallacy in England ) .
Unfortunately the same situation prevails in Australia .
The Austrians , however , explained in detail how trying to stabilise the price level will actually destabilise the economy and bring on the very depression the policy was designed to avoid .
According to the Austrians the Fed 's credit expansion would trigger a speculative boom , which it did ; eventually the Fed would be forced to apply the monetary brakes , which it did in December 1928 when it froze the money supply ; this would cause malinvestments created by the credit expansion to start emerging by about the middle of the 1929 , which is exactly what happened ; the bubble would then quickly burst and the economy would go into a fully fledged depression -- the rest , as they say , is history .
Yet some 80 years later we are still being told that economics failed to predict the Great Depression , despite the historical fact that a group of economists succeeded where the mainstream forecasters failed .
Widespread ignorance of this fact among those who should know better is an intellectual scandal .
Unfortunately Brookesnews is the only Australian publication in which you can find this knowledge .
You will certainly never find it in the mainstream media .

A severe recession is upon the United States .
We as citizens need to wake up and realize our financial stability is on the brink of cracking .
Check out www.recession2008.wordpress.com and watch some of the smartest people in the world debate this issue and talk about the facts hidden from us .

His story raced around the world – a tale of a desperate battle to fight off a shark which still managed to inflict deep bite wounds in his arm .
But now alleged shark attack " victim " Scott Wright , 34 , was behind bars after police sources claimed that he was a cat burglar who had cut his arm breaking into a house .
The sensational developments came after Wright , an out - of - work traveller from South Australia , appeared in court , his injured arm heavily bandaged , on housebreaking , robbery and car theft charges .
Scroll down for more ...
Police sources claim that Wright 's story of a frantic fight to make the shark let go of his arm as he swam at night off Sydney 's famous Bondi Beach was ' pie in the sky ' .
Earlier this week Wright appeared in newspapers and on television around the world , telling an amazing story of his battle for life .
" The shark attacked me , grabbed hold of my arm and would n't let go , " Wright said as he was being treated in hospital for the deep wounds in his arm .
" So I ended up punching him on the nose and trying to fight him off .
" I thought I was a goner .
I thought I was going to die . "
But far from receiving the deep gouges in his arm from the razor - sharp teeth of a shark , police sources claim they were sustained from jagged pieces of glass when Wright broke into a house through a window .
The break - in , say police , occurred several days before he told his story of the shark attack .
He made his claims after saying his girlfriend found him semi-conscious in a beachside cave the following morning after he managed to swim ashore from the shark attack .
Lifeguards said at the time they were surprised that a shark had managed to get past the anti-shark nets that stretch across the entire length of the beach 600 yards from the shore .
It would have been the first attack in 70 years .
Shortly after his girlfriend allegedly found him in the cave , Wright was asked by a woman shopper on the Bondi seafront how he had received the severe cuts to his arm .
He told her he had been bitten by a shark – and the story spread .
He received a number of stitches at a Sydney hospital , where he maintained the alleged pretence , but by then police were investigating a number of break - ins in the Bondi district .
It was not long before Wright found himself under intense questioning by detectives , who had spoken to lifeguards and heard them express surprise that a shark attack had occurred .
It is understood that blood samples have been collected from the scene of one housebreaking .
Wright , who is said to have been responsible for further thefts even after he was released from hospital , has been remanded in custody and will next appear in court on February 18 .
He did not apply for bail .
Blackwater , a private security company which has been contracted to protect high - profile US officials and foreign dignitaries in Iraq , had been using Heckler & Koch machine guns in both Iraq and Afghanistan , German broadcaster ARD 's " Report Mainz " program reported Monday , Feb. 19 .
The German arms manufacturer contacted the program shortly before the report was aired on Monday night and said it would cut all its ties to the US firm , according to " Report Mainz . "
The German company on its Web site described its work with Blackwater as a " unique and strategic partnership " in which the two firms were cooperating to develop " special edition " firearms and offer training courses in the United States to use Heckler & Koch weapons .
The firms ' cooperation was meant to be about training courses in North Carolina
There was no mention of Iraq or Afghanistan , and the company reportedly denied it had developed a weapon for Blackwater , as reported by the TV program .
The German government had not given Heckler & Koch permission to provide Blackwater with firearms , " Report Mainz " said , referring to information it received from Germany 's Economics Ministry .
Exploiting a loophole ?
Heckler & Koch would not provide the program with information as to how Blackwater got its weapons .
However , it may have taken advantage of a loophole by merely transferring the firearms to its US subsidiary , which then handed over the wares , the report suggested .
Blackwater has been under intense scrutiny from the US Congress as a result of the high number of civilian deaths and injuries the company has caused in Iraq .
The most controversial incident was in September , when Blackwater guards were said to have fatally shot 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad .
The company is neither subject to Iraqi law , nor governed by US military tribunals , which allows it to operate without fear of repercussions .
Politicians want oversight
" It is scandalous and unacceptable that a German arms company cooperates with such a lawless mercenary troop … although it must know that this firm is involved in illegal killings in Iraq , " Green party parliamentarian Hans Christian Ströbele told the program 's reporters .
The Social Democrats ' foreign policy spokesman , Gert Weisskirchen , called for legislation to prevent German firms from participating in the " privatization of war " and said that " such cooperation should be scrutinized . "
Free Democratic Party parliamentarian Werner
Hoyer echoed those comments , saying that there was a gap in legislation that needed to be closed .
It seems that everything comes in a list format nowadays .
“ Wash , Rinse , and Repeat ” or “ Open box , Remove Contents , Try and Assemble ” .
Maybe it is because when we see things in a list format , our brain interprets them as a set of instructions or rules that must be followed .
The proliferation of articles about happiness as of late has been astonishing .
Everybody is coming up with the magic formula for finding happiness .
I do n’t know about you , but I need to keep things simple and in perspective at all times .
Would n’t it be great if there was a simple set of instructions for living a happy and fulfilled life ?
How about an instruction manual for life ?
Unfortunately , things are not that easy .
However , there are techniques and tips you can use in your everyday life that can help you find happiness and fulfillment as you go through the journey of life .
Take a look at the list below .
Keep life simple .
Far too many of us are always over analyzing and looking for the most complicated way of doing things in life .
For the most part , life is meant to be simple – a walk through the park , a simple yes or no answer or a quiet evening with the family .
Do n’t try and clutter your life with unnecessary decisions by making everything complicated and complex .
Keep it simple !

Why a Simple Life is a Happy Life
Practice being satisfied .
How many times have you heard someone say , “ If only I had a few more dollars I ’d … ” or “ If I just had another day off I could … ” ?
Many people do n’t know how to be satisfied with what life gives them .
They are so busy wanting more that they squander what life has already given them .
Beware of indecision .
Nobody said life is easy and sometimes , you have to make the tough choices .
Never put off a decision that you can make today .
You may miss some of the best and most exciting opportunities in the world because you were indecisive .
Successful people did n’t get where they were at by prolonging or going back and forth on decisions !
Practice cheerfulness .
You ’ve heard it before and you ’ll hear it here again :
It only takes a few muscles to smile !
You would be surprised at how well being cheerful to others can spread like wildfire .
We live in a society where it seems that glumness is the rule of order .
A simple smile or kind word can spread through our culture like wildfire .
Learn to like people .
You do n’t have to love everyone you encounter , so learn to like people .
Often , you wo n’t agree with everything they do or maybe all of their beliefs .
By learning to get along with them , you will open your mind up to change .
It is a critical trait that is absolutely necessary in today ’s world .
Live and let live .
Is it really your concern what the guy across the street wants to do with his life or who he wants to share his life with ?
Learn to live your life to the fullest and let others do the same .
None of us is above anyone else and none of us should think we should be allowed to dictate how other people should live their life .
Adversity teaches .
Adversity can be one of the most powerful teachers we will ever have in our lives .
You will learn so much about life by overcoming adversity and learning how to face it head on .
Adversity often comes dressed in many different outfits , but you will change your life by learning how to deal with it and prosper from it .
Do n’t take yourself so seriously .
Here is a secret : it ’s ok to be a little goofy now and then !
You only get one shot at this life , so make the most of it .
Have some fun and show your children and those around you that you know how to have fun .
You are n’t the greatest gift to mankind this world has ever had so do n’t act like it !
You may find you add years to your life , not to mention a ton of laughter !
Have a sense of humor .
Laughter has been shown to help people live longer , lower prevalence of cardiovascular diseases , and help them relate to people from around the world .

Practice objectivity .
Be objective in your decision - making and risk - taking .
Know the facts and avoid letting racial , social or any other type of bias influence your decisions .
Great leaders perform their best when they act based on facts , not on emotion or prejudices .
Become a great leader in your life .
Tolerate your own mistakes .
You will make mistakes .
In fact , you will make so many mistakes you will never be able to list them all .
Learn that mistakes happen and the best thing you can do is to learn from them .
Do n’t spend your entire life dwelling on a mistake you made years ago – learn from it and move on .
The world is n’t going to wait while you live in the past .
Forgive yourself .
Stop beating yourself up over things that happened in the past , the things you did or did n’t do , and mistakes you may have made with others .
Forgiving yourself is a skill so few of us have the ability to accomplish .
It ’s such a shame that we spend a lifetime living in the past and never make it to our full potential in the future .
Forgive yourself and , just as importantly , forgive others .
It may seem like a rather long list , but I encourage you to read it and then refer back to it every now and then .
You ’ll see each one ties into the others in some fashion and that these simple steps really do help you live a more meaningful , happy and fulfilled life .
Life happens .
Be a part of it .

First , let me answer the 2 basic questions about Mortgage Escrow .
What is an escrow ?
An escrow is when you include your taxes and insurance with your monthly mortgage payment .
How does Escrow work ?
1. Buyer , seller and the Escrow Agent sign the escrow agreement .
2. Buyer deposits money and / or documents in escrow .
3 . The Escrow Agent manages the escrow account .
4 . The Escrow Agent confirms to the seller that the escrow amount and / or documents have been received in the escrow account .
5 . Seller performs the required services .
6 . Buyer accepts delivery and proof of acceptance is sent to The Escrow Agent .
7 . The Escrow Agent releases the money and / or documents in escrow .
Now here ’s my situation .
I ’m in the process of finalizing my mortgage for buying my first home .
( I have to make a decision by the end of this month ) .
I got Good Faith Estimates from a number of lenders and all of them had $ 2000 – $ 2500 going towards the escrow account .
so I assumed thats how it has to be .
But then during a conversation with one mortgage broker , he asked me if I wanted to escrow my taxes and insurance .
I then asked him if that will help me get a better rate or if there are any other advantages to an escrow account .
He said that if I do n’t escrow the lender sometimes charges a quarter point .
But I have checked this and most big banks and lenders do n’t really care either way .
So I negotiated with the broker and he said that he is willing to “ eat up ” that quarter point .
So that got me thinking .
Should you , or should you not , go for an escrow account ?
The major advantage of a mortgage escrow is that the lender assumes responsibility for paying your property taxes and homeowners insurance .
This is also the major disadvantage .
In addition , with an escrow the lender gets to keep the interest on your account .
Many people do n’t want to get a big tax bill all at once .
They prefer to pay a little bit every month and do n’t want the headache of paying it on time .
Having said that , there have been cases where the lender failed to pay it on time causing an even bigger headache to the borrower .
So what will I do ?
I ’m going to pass on the escrow account .
For control freaks like me , I like to be in charge of paying my dues on time and not lose any interest on my money .
There are 2 big advantages I see by not escrowing .
One I pay less at closing , and two , I pay less every month .
Of course I ’ll get a big tax bill , but I think I can handle that .

* Photo : William Taylor * Nicholas Carr is high tech 's Captain Buzzkill — the go - to guy for bad news .
A former executive editor of Harvard Business Review , he tossed a grenade under big - budget corporate computing with his 2004 polemic Does IT Matter ?
( Answer : Not really , because all companies have it in spades . )
Carr 's new book , The Big Switch , targets the emerging " World Wide Computer " — dummy PCs tied to massive server farms way up in the data cloud .
We asked Carr why he finds the future of computing so scary .
Wired : IBM founder Thomas J. Watson is quoted — possibly misquoted — as saying the world needs only five computers .
Is it true ?
Carr : The World Wide Web is becoming one vast , programmable machine .
As NYU 's Clay Shirky likes to say , Watson was off by four .
Wired :
When does the big switch from the desktop to the data cloud happen ?
Carr : Most people are already there .
Young people in particular spend way more time using so - called cloud apps — MySpace , Flickr , Gmail — than running old - fashioned programs on their hard drives .
What 's amazing is that this shift from private to public software has happened without us even noticing it .
Wired :
What happened to privacy worries ?
Carr : People say they 're nervous about storing personal info online , but they do it all the time , sacrificing privacy to save time and money .
Companies are no different .
The two most popular Web - based business applications right now are for managing payroll and customer accounts — some of the most sensitive information companies have .
Wired :
What 's left for PCs ?
Carr :
They 're turning into network terminals .
Wired : Just like Sun Microsystems ' old mantra , " The network is the computer " ?
Carr :
It 's no coincidence that Google CEO Eric Schmidt cut his teeth there .
Google is fulfilling the destiny that Sun sketched out .
Wired :
But a single global system ?
Carr : I used to think we 'd end up with something dynamic and heterogeneous — many companies loosely joined .
But we 're already seeing a great deal of consolidation by companies like Google and Microsoft .
We 'll probably see some kind of oligopoly , with standards that allow the movement of data among the utilities similar to the way current moves through the electric grid .
Wired :
What happened to the Web undermining institutions and empowering individuals ?
Carr : Computers are technologies of liberation , but they 're also technologies of control .
It 's great that everyone is empowered to write blogs , upload videos to YouTube , and promote themselves on Facebook .
But as systems become more centralized — as personal data becomes more exposed and data - mining software grows in sophistication — the interests of control will gain the upper hand .
If you 're looking to monitor and manipulate people , you could n't design a better machine .
Wired :
So it 's Google über alles ?
Carr : Yeah .
Welcome to Google Earth .
A bunch of bright computer scientists and AI experts in Silicon Valley are not only rewiring our computers — they 're dictating the future terms of our culture .
It 's terrifying .
Wired : Back to the future — HAL lives !
Carr :
The scariest thing about Stanley Kubrick 's vision was n't that computers started to act like people but that people had started to act like computers .
We 're beginning to process information as if we 're nodes ; it 's all about the speed of locating and reading data .
We 're transferring our intelligence into the machine , and the machine is transferring its way of thinking into us .

To understand the failure of the president ’s trip to the Middle East , which is foreordained and does n’t have to be completed in order to fail , take note of two words that the president will not utter : " occupied territories . "
Let ’s review the situation from the standpoint of international law .
The West Bank , Gaza , the Golan Heights , East Jerusalem and a smidgen of Lebanon the Israelis still occupy are officially designated as occupied territories .
They were seized in war .
Jerusalem is officially an international city , so designated by the United Nations partition resolution that created the state of Israel .
The Israelis , of course , long ago declared the resolution null and void .
As occupied territories , they fall under the Geneva Conventions .
An occupying power is not allowed to take land or to build settlements in occupied territory .
It is not allowed to destroy homes , to uproot olive groves , to deport people , and to wall the area off  all of which the Israelis have done and are continuing to do .
This brings us to the equation of negotiations .
It is impossible for the Palestinians , whose land is occupied and whose lives are totally controlled by the most powerful military state in the Middle East , to make any concessions .
To make a concession , you have to have something .
They have nothing .
They have no power .
They do n’t control their land , their borders , their access to the sea or the air , the water or even their movements within the territories .
Thanks to the American vetoes , they do n’t even have any recourse in the U.N .
The only party , then , that can make concessions is Israel , and Israel is not making any concessions , since it far prefers land to peace with an enemy that is virtually powerless .
Therefore , if the U.S. refuses to pressure Israel , there will be no peace .
President Bush ’s trip is nothing more than a public - relations ploy to simulate an interest in peace .
Bush is , however , unwilling to say or do anything that might actually result in Israeli concessions and therefore in peace .
In fact , the main purpose of Bush ’s visit is to harangue the Arabs about the alleged dangers of Iran .
He refuses to talk to the elected representatives of the Palestinians , who are Hamas members .
I see no change in Bush ’s thinking , if you can call it that , at all , but I do notice that he looks depressed .
The last two public appearances I ’ve watched on television show an unhappy man .
The old cockiness and the silly smiles seem to have vanished .
It could be that slowly the news is trickling into his brain that his administration has been a flop .
In the meantime , the Palestinians continue to suffer , the world continues to ignore their suffering , and the kettle that is the Middle East continues to simmer .
It is never wise for either an individual or a country to believe that because it is powerful today it will always be powerful .
The Middle East is an open - air museum of the ruins of past conquerors .
It ’s quite a sad situation for everyone concerned .
If I were an Israeli , I ’d be concerned about forcing another generation of Palestinians to live in poverty and bitterness .
I ’d be concerned that another generation of Israeli children is going to have to grow up in a militarized state in the midst of a larger population that hates them .
As an American , I ’m concerned that cowardly politicians are putting Americans at risk out of fear of a domestic lobby .
Feb. 22 , 2008  --
A swanky nightclub in New York City is making headlines for something far less glamorous than the A - list celebs who show up to party there night after night .
Rather than clamoring for the usual fare of $ 12 cocktails , celebrity patrons of Socialista may instead be lining up for hepatitis A vaccinations after a bartender working there was hospitalized with the infectious disease .
A laundry list of high - profile celebrities were partying at the club Feb. 7 , one of the nights the New York City Department of Health said the infected bartender was on duty .
Ashton Kutcher 's birthday party was that night , which brought Demi Moore , Madonna , Salma Hayek , Gwyneth Paltrow , Ivanka Trump and Bruce Willis to the club .
Anywhere between 700 and 800 people visited the bar over the three nights the employee was on duty , according to the city health department , which released a statement .
" Any patron who visited the establishment after 8 p.m. Feb. 7 or 8 , or after 10 p.m. on Feb. 11 is considered to be at risk and needs a preventive shot , " the statement read .
Employees who answered phone calls at Socialista did not want their names revealed nor did they want to elaborate on the incident , but one told ABC News that the employee in question , who has been identified only as Leif , was " a good friend . "
She declined to comment further , because she said she " truly cared about the restaurant . "
In an e-mail message to ABCNEWS.com , Socialista 's owner , Armin Armiri , said , " Although no additional cases of illness have been identified , the New York City Department of Health is urging customers to get the vaccination as a precautionary measure .
We are grateful for their efforts and we will continue to support them in every way possible . "
Calls to publicists of several of the celebrities who attended the party were no immediately returned .
Hepatitis A , a liver disease , is contracted by putting something in your mouth that has been contaminated with fecal matter from an infected person .
It is frequently spread when an infected person fails to wash his or his hands after using the toilet .
Because the disease is highly contagious at it's peak -- usually 10 days before the patient notices symptoms and seeks medical attention -- doctors and hospitals must report any patient who is diagnosed with the infection .
The health department must then notify anyone who may have been in contact with the individual .
Signs of infection include severe diarrhea , nausea , fatigue and sometimes jaundice , a yellowing of the eyes and skin .
There is no antibiotic treatment , and those who get it must let it run its course , which usually takes about a month .
No Soap Can Mean Infection
When the New York City Health Department visited Socialista Feb. 20 , it found no soap for hand - washing , a precaution that is vital in preventing the infection from spreading , according to health care professionals .
" [ Hepatitis A ] is the least fatal overall , and most people do recover without any problems , " said Dr. Douglas Holt , the associate director of infectious disease at the University of South Florida College of Medicine in Tampa .
" But it 's a fairly tough virus .
It tends to survive in the environment longer than many other viruses . "
Because the most common way to contract hepatitis A is by putting contaminated food in your mouth , Holt said it was quite possible that the disease could spread from the bartender at Socialista to patrons , especially given the absence of soap .
" If an infected person goes to the bathroom and gets bacteria in his hands and then shakes someone 's hand or fixes food or drinks or even fruit to put in the drinks , there is the risk that someone else is going to get it , " said Holt , who also works at the Hillsborough County Health Department .
" It 's even possible just from reaching into a bowl of pretzels or peanuts . "
As of 2006 , children haev been routinely vaccinated against the different strains of hepatitis , but adults have not necessarily received the precautionary vaccine .
Holt suspects that because many travelers get vaccinated for hepatitis A before visiting regions like Eastern Europe and South America , many of the jet - setting guests at Socialista may already be protected .
If patrons who visited the club on the days in question have not been vaccinated , though , Holt strongly suggests that they get vaccinated .
" Even if one person who has it has a mild illness they could expose their brand - new baby or their elderly relatives to it and then we have a secondary or third case on our hands , " said Holt , who noted that young children and the elderly usually contract more serious strains of the infection .
" It 's about protecting those individuals but also in the small or possible chance you spread it to somebody else you 're trying to put the kibosh on this .
Get the vaccine . "

Before a packed house including Vice Presidential daughter Liz Cheney and former VP aide Mary Matalin , Iraq surge godfathers Frederick Kagan and Gen. Jack Keane faced off against a proponent of a phased withdrawal from Iraq at a discussion at the American Enterprise Institute today .
“ I think I am the designated skunk at the AEI surge garden party , ” said James Miller , of the new centrist think tank , Center for a New American Security , a former Clinton era deputy assistant secretary of defense , from the panel .
And in a way , that ’s exactly what he was meant to be .
Miller is the co-author of a recent CNAS Iraq report , Phased Transition , that argues that the U.S. should reduce its troop presence in Iraq by 100,000 troops over the next year , and withdraw completely over the next five years .
By arguing for a planned phased withdrawal , Miller says his plan hopes to avoid what it sees as the likely alternative : a precipitous withdrawal in January 2009 when the Bush administration leaves office .
The report also argues for an increased advisory role for the U.S. in Iraq .
AEI military expert Tom Donnelly recently brought out the big guns , taking to the pages of the Weekly Standard ( several floors below AEI ) in an article entitled “ Orderly Humiliation ” to tar the CNAS report as the “ Clintonista ” plan — in case any potential moderate Republican supporters of such a plan did n’t understand CNAS ’ genetic bloodlines .
Conservative scholar Max Boot went after it on the op - ed pages of the Los Angeles Times the same week .
Such coordinated critiques as well as today ’s event indicate that the architects of the Iraq invasion and the surge are nervous about the political pressure growing on the White House to rethink the U.S. strategy and reduce the U.S. troop presence in Iraq .
Pressure that is increasingly coming from Senate Republicans .
At the AEI event today , Miller argued that the surge had had two goals : 1 ) reducing the violence in Iraq , particularly in Baghdad , and 2 ) facilitating political reconciliation .
He said that violence has partially subsided in Baghdad but is now increasing elsewhere ; and that there has been essentially zero progress in furthering political reconciliation among Iraq ’s ethnic groups .
Kagan , a bespectacled resident scholar at AEI , argued , contra Miller , that the surge is showing signs of political progress .
“ Are we so impatient ?
Are the stakes so low ?
Is it easier to declare failure ? ”
An Iraq expert who attended the event comments , “ The AEI crowd thinks that we are making real progress , should ignore politics at home , and cut the Iraqi government some slack …
They completely fail to grasp that in pursuing the surge until our country is strategically and politically exhausted , and not thinking about a transitional presence as part of a responsible withdrawal , they will end up triggering a precipitous withdrawal the minute Bush leaves office . ”
The AEI debate on this sweltering Washington day drew the kind of crowd you would expect to see for the kind of high stakes event the think tank ran during the height of the Iraq invasion .
And the stakes are high : while the panel moderator Danielle Pletka mourned at the end everyone was only talking about the surge in the context of U.S. domestic politics , and not U.S. national security , the event organizers too are arguing for a strategy they see as urgently necessary for political vindication , but one that has lost the support of the vast majority of the American public .
As the presence of Cheney daughter Liz and aide Matalin attest , the public debate continues a private discussion with a more receptive audience of two in the White House .
So , apparently , less than two weeks after starting this blog , I ended up on programming .
reddit.com ( direct link ) for this entry on the fact that most monad tutorials are awful , and offering a pointer to a paper .
Apparently if you tag an entry with ‘ monads , ’ avid Haskell users flock to your blog ( I exaggerate of course – just many more people than otherwise read my blog ) .
Really , I suspect that using that tag just got more people to notice , and most of the hits came from Reddit , where I was probably only posted because I had a bit of an opinion , plus a link to Wadler ’s paper .
Interesting phenomenon .
Apparently I got a peak of 1,015 page views on August 2nd , as well as getting included in the “ Blog Noise ” section of Haskell Weekly News .
Having never really blogged about anything other than my personal life before this summer , it ’s interesting to see how certain keywords draw spikes of attention .
For that reason , I ’m specifically not tagging this entry with ‘ haskell ’ or ‘ monads ’ because I do n’t want to distract that many people .
Just thought it was interesting .
EDIT : Hello again , reddit -ors .
The key changes from before are as follows :
The depenguinator now works with recent FreeBSD releases .
The makefs code borrowed from NetBSD is updated , and as a result will compile on more recent versions of Linux .
Instead of setting a root password , the depenguinator now installs an SSH public key .
Instead of constructing a disk image which must be written to the first 40 MB of the boot drive ( which would often fail if that space contained an active filesystem ) , the depenguinator now constructs a disk image which can be written to a swap partition ( after swapping is turned off , of course ) and then booted via GRUB .
Without further ado , here are the steps I needed to upgrade an Ubuntu 7.10 system to FreeBSD 7.0 - RC1 :
Install some bits which the depenguinator needs which are n't included in the default Ubuntu install .
apt - get install curl apt - get install bsdtar apt - get install libc6 - dev apt - get install zlib1g - dev Download the depenguinator and verify its SHA256 hash .
curl http://www.daemonology.net/depenguinator/depenguin-2.0.tar.gz > depenguin-2.0.tar.gz sha256sum depenguin-2.0.tar.gz
The computed SHA256 hash should be aa5d98dd3998545600f5af1d406196832ef8bea59cb022bc3a5efb303ac57cf7 .
Extract the depenguination code .
tar - xzf depenguin - 2.0.tar.gz cd depenguin - 2.0 Create the depenguinator configuration file .
mv depenguinator.conf.dist depenguinator.conf nano depenguinator.conf
This configuration file contains basic networking configuration parameters , so that the system can get back online after it boots into FreeBSD .
Download the FreeBSD disc1 ISO image and verify its SHA256 hash ( change " 7.0 " and " 7.0 - RC1 " as appropriate . ) curl ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/7.0/7.0-RC1-i386-disc1.iso > disc1.iso sha256sum disc1.iso
Compare the SHA256 hash against the hash contained in the announcement signed by the FreeBSD release engineer -- we 've never found any signs of Evil People deliberately tampering with release ISO images , but a few years ago there was a mirror which was corrupting ISO images due to a faulty network switch .
Create the disk image .
Change " 7.0 - RC1 " to the appropriate release name , and replace ~/.ssh / authorized_keys by the path to the SSH public keys you want to be authorized to login as root .
sh -e makeimage.sh disc1.iso 7.0-RC1 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Turn off swapping .
swapoff -a
Write the disk image to the partition which used to contain the swap space ( in my case , / dev/sda2 ) . dd if=disk.img of=/dev/sda2
Add FreeBSD to GRUB 's list of operating systems , and set it as the default system to boot into .
In my case , this meant adding title FreeBSD root ( hd0,1 ) makeactive chainloader +1 to / boot / grub / menu.lst and changing the default line to default 3 .
Reboot into FreeBSD .
shutdown -r now After waiting for the system to reboot , SSH back in ; FreeBSD is now running in a memory disk ; so now you can slice , partition , and create file systems on the hard drive(s ) and install FreeBSD however you wish .
If you find this useful , please consider donating to the FreeBSD Foundation and sending me an email to let me know that you have done so -- it 's remarkably gratifying to see such a concrete demonstration that people appreciate what I 've done .
Now go forth and depenguinate !
An NCEAS working group published the first global assessment of cumulative human impacts on the ocean in Science on February 15 , 2008 .
The findings , related maps , and openly available data became one of our most highly cited research efforts .
The assessment showed where cumulative impacts were greatest and least and which human activities were driving these results .
In 2015 , a team made up of many of the same original participants conducted an updated assessment to show how and why cumulative impacts change over time , and specifically since the original 2008 assessment .
Their results were published July 14 , 2015 inNature Communications .
The results are intended to help assess the effectiveness of past management and conservation actions and guide future management efforts .
Trainer McNamee turns over evidence on Clemens
Recommended Video :
The lawyers for trainer Brian McNamee dropped a bombshell Wednesday , claiming they gave federal prosecutors physical evidence that proves Roger Clemens used performance - enhancing drugs .
The New York Daily News , citing an anonymous source close to McNamee , reported the evidence will include syringes McNamee says were used to inject Clemens with human growth hormone and steroids , in addition to empty bottles and gauze .
" I think this is a significant point in the case , " said McNamee 's lead lawyer , Earl Ward .
" We believe that this is significant corroboration . "
Clemens attorney Lanny Breuer attacked McNamee 's credibility in a statement .
" Brian McNamee is obviously a troubled man who is obsessed with doing everything possible to destroy Roger Clemens , " Breuer said .
McNamee was a key figure in the Mitchell Report — an investigation into drug use in baseball — that was released in December , saying he injected Clemens with performance - enhancing drugs in 1998 , 2000 and 2001 .
Clemens repeatedly has denied the accusations and has filed a defamation lawsuit against McNamee .
Clemens gave a five - hour sworn deposition Tuesday to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and afterward again denied using performance - enhancing drugs .
Clemens , former teammates and Houston residents Andy Pettitte and Chuck Knoblauch and McNamee will appear before the committee in a public hearing Wednesday .
McNamee will give a deposition to the committee today .

" As Roger has said under oath to Congress and to the American public , at no time did he take steroids or growth hormone , " Breuer said .
" Despite the desperate smears of Brian McNamee , Roger is looking forward to testifying before Congress next week to set the record straight .
" He will not waver , nor will he shrink from this , because he is telling the truth .
We ask all fair - minded people to listen .
It is time for Brian McNamee to be subject to the same scrutiny as Roger Clemens . "
Clemens could open himself up to prosecution if it 's proved he lied under oath about using performance - enhancing drugs .
Richard Emery , another of McNamee 's lawyers , said the committee will be given a description of the evidence that was turned over to prosecutors .
" It does change the nature of the case from a 'he said , she said ' to something about physical evidence , " Emery said .
Meeting with lawmaker
A spokeswoman for Rep. Elijah Cummings , D - Md. , a member of the Oversight Committee , said a representative for Clemens contacted Cummings ' office Wednesday to set up a " one - on - one " meeting with the lawmaker .
Cummings spokeswoman Jen Kohl said several other committee members also were asked to meet individually after the report that McNamee had given federal prosecutors physical evidence surfaced .
Cummings is expected to meet with Clemens today .
McNamee , the former personal trainer for Clemens and Pettitte , also told former Senate majority leader George Mitchell that he injected Pettitte with HGH .
Pettitte corroborated the claim by admitting he used HGH twice to help him recover from an injury .
Emery said McNamee 's legal team planned to hold a news conference after their client 's deposition in Washington today and will discuss the evidence in greater detail then .
Clemens ' camp could contend the evidence was tampered with , considering it was alleged to have been collected seven years ago .
" ( McNamee ) has changed his story repeatedly on this matter , " Breuer said .
" He claims to love Roger Clemens .
He says he modeled being a father on Roger Clemens .
He said Roger treated him like family — but he now claims he kept blood , gauze and needles from Roger Clemens for seven years .
It defies all sensibility .
It is just not credible .
Who in their right mind does such a thing ? "

The ancestral relationships of people living in the widely scattered islands of the Pacific Ocean , long a puzzle to anthropologists , may have been solved by a new genetic study , researchers reported Thursday .
In an analysis of the DNA of 1,000 individuals from 41 Pacific populations , an international team of scientists found strong evidence showing that Polynesians and Micronesians in the central and eastern islands had almost no genetic relationship to Melanesians , in the western islands like Papua New Guinea and the Bismarck and Solomons archipelagos .
The researchers also concluded that the genetic data showed that the Polynesians and Micronesians were most closely related to Taiwan Aborigines and East Asians .
They said this supported the view that these migrating seafarers originated in Taiwan and coastal China at least 3,500 years ago .
The findings were described in the online journal Public Library of Science Genetics ( www.plosgenetics.org) by researchers led by Jonathan S. Friedlaender , professor emeritus of biological anthropology at Temple University .
He was assisted in the data analysis by his wife , Françoise R. Friedlaender , an independent researcher .
Other participants included scientists in the islands and at the Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation in Marshfield , Wis .
“ So … uhh … how do I find a job that I love ? ”
Talk about money long enough , and the question inevitably comes up .
And it should .
Most of us spend 60 - 80 % of our waking hours doing something work - related .
If you do n’t enjoy that work , then it means you ’re unhappy 60 - 80 % of the time .
Logical , right ?
It would also make sense that the quickest way to improve your happiness would be to improve your enjoyment of the thing you spend the most time doing .
Since that ’s work , you wonder if you could n’t find something better .
But the question is , “ How ? ”
Here ’s what I think : the answer is in the title of this post .
Let ’s break it down , starting at the end of the title and working our way back to the beginning .
But just before we get into that , I want to quickly cover how work has changed over the last few years .
Work does n’t mean sitting in an office for 60 hours seek .
Sure , for some people , this is the case but the internet is transforming how we do everything .
And when it comes to business , it ’s changed how we start , run and grow them .
People like Sam Ovens are pioneering new ways of doing business that are helping people all over the world make more money and win more time in their lives .
So my point is that we ’ve never been more spoilt for choice when it comes to finding work that we love .
Anyway , here are some steps that ’ll help you on your journey … ”
Step One : Define Love
The word “ love ” describes a huge variety of emotions .
What does it mean to you ?
Meaningful
Fun
Abundant
Relaxing
Fulfilling
Most people just think they ’ll “ know it when they find it , ” but I think that ’s wrong .
You ’ll find it when you know it , not the other way around .
Take some time and figure out exactly what you mean when you say “ love . ” Envision it .
That way , you ’ll at least know what you ’re looking for .
Step Two : Define You
It ’s funny what happens when you try to define a word like love .
You start thinking about yourself .
Who are you right now ?
Who do you want to be ?
What do you really want ?
Can you really have it ?
Do you really deserve it ?
Finding happiness is more about self - discovery than career advice , and self - discovery usually starts with hard questions .
If you want a meaningful career , find the courage to ask them .
Step Three : Define Work
Once you know who you are and what you want , you can start tackling concepts like work .
For most people , “ work ” and “ happiness ” do n’t really go together .
Work means :
Being ticked off at your boss
Doing stuff you do n’t enjoy
A never - ending competition
Dealing with bureaucracy
Fighting to be noticed
If you want work that you love , then you ’ll have to change your conception of work .
You might even want to remove the word from your vocabulary entirely .
Personally , I divide actions into two categories : those moving me toward my objectives and those NOT moving me toward my objectives .
I try to always do the former and never do the latter .
Ever since , I ’ve never had a problem finding the motivation to “ work . ”
Is n’t that interesting ?
Step Four : Define Find
The act of “ finding ” normally involves the act of “ searching . ”
So , if you want to find a job you love , you have to commit yourself to searching for it .
That means :
Reading about other jobs and professions
Asking people what their work is like
Keeping an eye out for interesting opportunities
Updating your resume
Applying for jobs and going on interviews
Think of yourself like a detective , methodically searching for a missing person .
You do n’t just wait for them to appear out of nowhere .
You have to go looking for them .
Step Five : Define How
Here ’s the big question : once you find a job that looks like one you ’d love , how do you go about getting it ?
You might need to :
Pay for some specialized training
Build your reputation as an expert
Network with influencers in industry
Get some relevant work experience
Actually apply for the job
Whatever it requires , do it .
If you get turned down , just keep asking until you either find out why and fix the problem or they hire you because of your persistence .
Remember , you ’re either moving closer , or you ’re not .
How to Find Work That You Love
Did n’t I tell you the answer was in the title ?
If you look carefully , we ’ve worked through every content word in the sentence , starting with “ love ” and ending with “ how . ”
You can approach most problems this way .
Just break them down , figure out what all of the words mean , and you ’ll automatically start to understand what to do .
The one thing I ’ll add is , you might need to go through this process several times .
You ’ll start your dream job , find out you do n’t like it as much as you thought , and then move onto the next one .
I ’m going through that process for the fourth time in nine years .
Every time , I get a little closer , enjoying my work a little more .
And know what ?
It ’s worth it .

Right after Junior Seau 's interception clinched the Patriots ' 48 - 27 victory in Dallas on Sunday , my BlackBerry vibrated with a six - word text from my friend Willy :
Matthew Emmons-US PRESSWIRE
Do n't expect to see Tom Brady " take a knee " anytime soon .
" Here comes the Eff You TD . "
Three minutes later , it happened : Fourth - string running back Kyle Eckel rammed home a fourth - and - 1 carry with 19 seconds remaining in a 14 - point game .
Normally , you take a knee there ... but not this year .
Back in the mid-'80s , every time the Celtics walked off an opposing floor after a hard - fought road victory , a giddy Kevin McHale clenched his fists , raised his Frankenstein arms above his head and showed off his victorious armpits .
This was the hairy victory cigar of the Bird era .
Maybe the 2007 Patriots do n't have anything as magical as McHale 's pits , but they do have the " Eff You TD . "
It 's their little way of telling the other 31 teams , " You took shots at us after the Jets game , you discredited our three Super Bowls , you pretended we were the only team stealing opposing signals when everyone does it , so you know what ?
Eff you . "
You might remember me bringing this up in my Week 4 picks column : " Yeah , it 's wrong to run up the score .
I 'd be the first one to admit it .
But it 's a natural reaction to the way they were vilified for two straight weeks .
The rest of the nation turned them into a mutant cross between Cobra Kai and the Yankees , so screw it , they 're acting like the Cobra Kai Yankees .
Can you blame them ?
I can't answer that one objectively , so I wo n't try .
But if you do n't think they 'll be running up the score in Cincinnati on Monday night , you 're crazy . "
What happened in that Bengals game ?
Leading by 14 points with nine minutes left , the Pats commenced a climactic 85 - yard drive by putting Brady in the shotgun , then throwing five straight times before following it up with three Sammy Morris handoffs that brought them to Cincy 's 14 - yard line with 3:24 remaining .
Teams always run out the clock , make the opposing team burn the rest of its timeouts and kick the game - clinching field goal here , right ?
Not the 2007 Cobra Kai Yankees .
Coming off a Cincy timeout , Brady nailed Moss for a 14 - yard touchdown .
In other words , eff you .
As you might have heard by now , the Patriots are 6 - 0 , they 've outscored opponents by a 230 - 92 margin , and Tom Brady might quintuple Gus Frerotte 's QB rating before everything 's said and done .
In each of those six wins , they specifically went for a meaningless touchdown just to stick it to their opponents .
Here 's the complete list :
Week 1 at New York Jets ( 38 - 14 ) : 1 - yard TD by Heath Evans , 1:58 left .
Week 2 vs. San Diego ( 38 - 14 ) : 3 - yard TD by Sammy Morris , 3:18 left .
Week 3 vs. Buffalo ( 38 - 7 ) : 45 - yard TD catch by Randy Moss , 10:22 left .
Week 4 at Cincy ( 34 - 17 ) : 14 - yard TD catch by Randy Moss , 3:18 left .
Week 5 vs. Cleveland ( 34 - 17 ) : 15 - yard fumble return TD by Randall Gay , 0:42 left .
( Important note :
This came one play after the Pats failed to convert the " Eff You TD " on fourth - and - goal from Cleveland 's 4 when Brady just missed Kyle Brady in the end zone . )
Week 6 vs. Dallas ( 48 - 27 ) : 1 - yard TD run by Kyle Eckel , 0:19 left .
Matthew Emmons / US
Presswire Randy Moss and the Pats have outscored their opponents 230 - 92 in their 6 - 0 start .
What does this all mean , other than we should start preparing ourselves for the first 100 - point game in NFL history against the Jets in Week 15 ?
We have our first potentially dominant team of the hard - cap era , but more importantly , we have our first true NFL villain since the Raiders in the late - '70s .
Peoplethis team .
Theythem to lose .
It 's like having the ' 96 Bulls back , only if everyone despised them and MJ played garbage - time minutes just to make sure every opponent lost by 20 - plus points .
Regardless of how you feel about the 2007 Patriots , at the very least , you have to admit the following three things :
1 . You have n't seen football played this well in a long time .
Three weeks ago , Malcolm Gladwell e-mailed me to say he was heading to Europe and wanted to know if there was a Web site that allowed him to buy a game tape of the Pats - Bengals game and have it Fed Ex'ed to him .
When I asked why he did n't TiVo the game and just watch it when he came back , Gladwell explained he did n't want to wait that long -- the Pats were playing at such a high level , he was fascinated with them in a way that went beyond football .
And it 's true .
We have n't seen anything like this with professional sports in a while .
When Dallas took the lead in the third quarter Sunday , the thing that amazed me was n't that it happened , but how assured I was the Patriots would immediately answer with a score .
There was no doubt in my mind .
Honestly , I have n't felt this way about a Boston team since the ' 86 Celtics .
2. Barring injuries , it 's going to be an enormous , enormous deal if somebody beats New England this season .
That 's the sign of a truly great team , regardless of the sport .
During my sophomore year in college , I remember watching the ' 89 Niners and thinking , " There 's no way in hell they can be beaten .
You 'd need about 35 things to happen . "
As it turned out , they outscored their opponents by a 442-253 margin in the regular season , lost two games by a total of five points and rolled through their three playoff opponents by the unfathomable score of 126 - 26 .
Yeah , the ' 92 Cowboys were great ; so were the ' 94 Niners and the ' 98 Broncos .
But the ' 89 Niners were on a different level , and we have n't seen anything like it since .
Now we 're seeing it again .
Tim Heitman / US
Presswire Wes Welker has 11 catches in the destruction of Dallas .
It 's fun to have a old - school villain in sports again , right ?
There 's a reason every sports movie has a bad guy in it .
There 's a reason " USA 4 , USSR 3 " was the single greatest moment in American sports history .
There 's a reason people enjoy hating the Yankees and Duke as much as they do .
Over the past 25 years , we 've found more and more ways to become attached to sporting events -- there are fantasy teams , office pools , gambling and everything else .
On Sundays during the NFL season , I 'm rooting for so many different things that I can't even keep track of everything .
But here 's a case in which sports has been reduced to the purest form :
A great football team broke the rules and paid the price ; media members and NFL folks had a field day excoriating the team for what happened ; somewhere along the line , people decided the team 's Super Bowls were tainted even though the NFL did n't send out its much - discussed memo about videotaping opposing signals until September 2006 ; and that 's when the team made the collective decision , " You know what ?
Eff you ! "
It 's a two - word phrase that can't be printed on ESPN.com , but it 's become the mantra of the 2007 Patriots season .
Eff you .
You can see it with every rubbing - it - in touchdown in the fourth quarter , as well as every " Get 'em a body bag ... YEAHHHHHHHHH ! " reaction on the sidelines after it happens .
You can see it with Brady 's ticked - off game face that has n't changed for five straight weeks .
You can see it with Belichick 's super - satisfied grin during the postgame handshake with the opposing coach -- especially with Wade Phillips , who made the fatal mistake of taking a shot at the Pats this week , when Belichick looked liked he was dying to tell him , " Man , imagine what the score could have been had if we were allowed to videotape your terrible coaching signals ! "
It 's a great football team with an even greater edge .
If you 're rooting against them , you hate them for it .
If you 're rooting for them , you love it and feel the same way .
Best of all , there 's no middle ground .
Maybe the 2007 Pats were caught stealing signals , but only one signal matters anymore : two middle fingers turned toward the sky .
LCS Thoughts
While we 're here , I had to mention a few thoughts from the baseball playoffs :
1 . I underestimated how much I 'd enjoy watching the NLCS -- specifically , Colorado 's 20 - for - 21 run while being firmly entrenched in must - win mode , which has to rank among the most remarkable feats in recent baseball history .
Normally , I root against newer teams -- you know , just out of principle -- but after sifting through some heartfelt e-mails from Rockies fans over the weekend and seeing the way they were supported last night , it 's hard not to feel good about what 's happening for them .
They 're like a sports movie sprung to life .
They 're in the zone .
You can see it .
One thing shocked me though : On " SportsCenter " on Sunday night , former Bronco Mark Schelereth mentioned the Rockies had taken Denver by storm and the locals did n't even care that the Broncos were stinking up the joint .
I thought that was startling .
Did you ever think a crummy Broncos team would get swept under the rug by the Rockies ?
2 . Six notes from the Red Sox 's crushing Game 2 loss :
A . It would have been between 10 and 100 times more crushing if 2004 had never happened .
Pre -2004 , the 11th inning would have left me catatonic .
There 's no question .
Instead , I was just angry and bitter .
Much better .
B. Eric
Wedge put on a clinic in that game -- specifically , bringing back Rafael Betancourt for the ninth inning and pitching Tom Mastny over Joe Borowski in the 10th ( which was bizarre when it happened since he was basically announcing , " I do n't trust my closer in a tie game " ) .
Every move worked .
C. You can't really judge a playoff team until you 're going against them in the postseason .
Heading into this series , I was frightened of Victor Martinez and that 's it .
After watching two games , I 'm frightened of Martinez ( who 's just deadly ) , Grady Sizemore ( definitely making The Leap ) and Jhonny Peralta ( just because he takes those giant cuts ) .
I 'm also mildly scared of Asdrubal Cabrera , one of those classic playoff infielders with a knack for getting dink singles at the worst possible times .
It 's a really good Indians team .
There 's no question .
With that said , we have n't seen their Achilles ' heel ( Borowski ) in a big moment yet .
D. Fox named Trot Nixon as the " player of the game , " which made for a fun story and all , but who was more valuable in that game than Betancourt and Mastny ( who retired Boston 's 3 - 4 - 5 in the 10th ) ?
Really ?
A dink hit with no outs and two runners on outweighs Betancourt keeping them alive and Mastny retiring Manny , Ortiz and Lowell in order ?
E. The No. 1 thing that killed the Red Sox in Game 2 : Because of the ridiculously late start ( 8:21 at night ) , the weather ( dipped into the mid-40s as the game went on ) and the length of the game ( at 11 p.m. , we were still in the fifth inning ) , Fenway 's homefield advantage was removed by midnight .
Anyone who has ever watched a late - night playoff game at Fenway can tell you that it's one of the secretly coldest places on the earth .
By the late innings , the crowd was dead -- and on top of that , half of them were probably figuring out how the hell they were getting home if they had taken the T ( Boston 's subway ) .
I knew we were in trouble in the 10th when the crowd could n't even get a " Man-ny ! Man-ny ! " chant going .
It was a best - case scenario for the visiting Indians -- for the last few innings , they were practically playing at a neutral site .
We wo n't see that happen in Cleveland on Monday with the 7 p.m. start time , but watch what happens in Games 4 and 5 with those 8 p.m. start times .
The bottom line is the phrase " homefield advantage " does n't matter nearly as much as it should when it 's midnight , it 's 40 degrees outside and you have a stadium filled with frozen fans .
F. The No. 2 thing that killed the Red Sox in Game 2 : Having to shut down prized rookie Clay Buchholz for the season because of a tired arm .
He could have pitched either the fifth inning ( in relief of Schilling ) or the 11th inning and would have been good for 40 - 50 pitches .
Instead , Francona had to choose between Javier Lopez , Jon Lester and ...
( Wait , this deserves its own paragraph . )
F. Sometimes in sports , you just know .
When Eric Gagne emerged from the bullpen before the 11th , he should have just been dressed like one of the killers in " Scream . "
You know somebody stinks when I 'm getting e-mails before he has even thrown a single pitch with subject headings like " WHY ????????? " and " KILL ME !!!!!! "
These post - collapse e-mails summed it up :
Van A. in Massachusetts : I realize that , given the pitchers who 'd already been used , that Gagne was technically our best reliever yet .
But the guy had two months to prove himself to be reliable in any fashion and failed miserably in every test .
Would I have been enthused if Javier Lopez had started off the inning for us ?
Of course not .
But I would n't have been conceding defeat like everyone else who has even remotely followed this team since the trading deadline .
Bob in Boston : Is Eric Gag - me becoming Terry Francona 's Rex Grossman ?
This guy has been terrible , but yet he keeps throwing him out there .
" Eric is a valuable guy in our bullpen , and I will continue to throw him out there . "
Sounds A LOT like " Rex is our quarterback . "
Melanie in Boston :
My plan for the Red Sox to win the ALCS involves drugging Eric Gagne and putting him on a plane to some remote African jungle and stealing his passport so he can never come back .
Alex in West Virginia :
Why is Eric Gagne even on the postseason roster ?
He 's got the word GAG right in his FREAKING name !!!
Gene in Oregon :
What was your level of concern when you saw Gagne coming in from the bullpen in the 11th ?
Would you relate it to getting pulled over by the cops with a bag of weed in the car or accidently killing a hooker ?
Gene in Yakima , Wash . :
When I heard Gagne was warming up in the bullpen in the bottom of the 10th , I figured it could only be a ploy for Francona to motivate Mike Lowell to get a hit .
Lowell had to realize that if Gagne was up , it was now or never at the plate .
When Gagne made his entrance , I knew my best option at that time was to just turn it off and go to bed .
I 'm not sure why but I forced myself to watch yelling the whole time , " I knew it , I knew it . "
Will N. in Brooklyn , N.Y. : I understand why Gagne chose No. 83 , but have n't we seen enough to realize there 's some seriously bad karma going on with that non-baseball , spring training number ?
Ca n't they switch him to double zero ?
Ca n't you envision him being more menacing and effective spotting 00 on his back ?
Yes , I realize Gagne has officially made me lose my mind .
( This is where you say " Ladies and gentlemen , the Eric Gagne era ! " ) .
Ladies and gentleman , the Eric Gagne era !

Huckabee stands by AIDS statement Katie Baker

This GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee said Sunday that he stands by the statement he made 15 years ago that AIDS patients should have been isolated .
" I did n't say that we should quarantine , " Huckabee said in an interview with Fox News , " I simply made the point , and I still believe this today , that in the late ' 80s and early ' 90's , when we did n't know as much as we do now about AIDS , we were acting more out of political correctness than ... normal health protocols . "
When , Chris Wallace reminded Huckabee that The Centers for Disease Control announced that AIDS could not be spread by casual contact seven years before Huckabee made the statement , Huckabee referred to the case of Kimberly Bergalis , who claimed to contract AIDS from her dentist .
Huckabee admitted that he would " probably " word things differently today , but said that he would not retract his original statement .
" The point was not saying we ought to lock people up who have HIV / AIDS , " he said , adding that friends of his have died from the disease , one who was a homosexual .
" Sure , in light of 15 years of additional knowledge and understanding I would [ say the statement differently ] , " said Huckabee .
" But what I 'm not going to do is go back and now try to change every story I 've ever had . "
Huckabee failed to address other past issues that Wallace raised , such as the fact that he opposed increased federal funding to find a cure for AIDS , and that he called homosexuality a " sinful lifestyle that posed a dangerous health risk . " source : Federal News Service
Suffering from its exorbitant price point and a dearth of titles , Sony 's PlayStation 3 is n't exactly the most popular gaming platform on the block .
But while the console flounders in the commercial space , the PS3 may be finding a new calling in the realm of science and research .
Right now , a cluster of eight interlinked PS3s is busy solving a celestial mystery involving gravitational waves and what happens when a super - massive black hole , about a million times the mass of our own sun , swallows up a star .
As the architect of this research , Dr. Gaurav Khanna is employing his so - called " gravity grid " of PS3s to help measure these theoretical gravity waves – ripples in space - time that travel at the speed of light – that Einstein 's Theory of Relativity predicted would emerge when such an event takes place .
It turns out that the PS3 is ideal for doing precisely the kind of heavy computational lifting Khanna requires for his project , and the fact that it 's a relatively open platform makes programming scientific applications feasible .
" The interest in the PS3 really was for two main reasons , " explains Khanna , an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts , Dartmouth who specializes in computational astrophysics .
" One of those is that Sony did this remarkable thing of making the PS3 an open platform , so you can in fact run Linux on it and it does n't control what you do . "
He also says that the console 's Cell processor , co-developed by Sony , IBM and Toshiba , can deliver massive amounts of power , comparable even to that of a supercomputer – if you know how to optimize code and have a few extra consoles lying around that you can string together .
" The PS3 / Linux combination offers a very attractive cost - performance solution whether the PS3s are distributed ( like Sony and Stanford 's Folding@home initiative ) or clustered together ( like Khanna's ) , says Sony 's senior development manager of research and development , Noam Rimon .
According to Rimon , the Cell processor was designed as a parallel processing device , so he's not all that surprised the research community has embraced it .
" It has a general purpose processor , as well as eight additional processing cores , each of which has two processing pipelines and can process multiple numbers , all at the same time , " Rimon says .
This is precisely what Khanna needed .
Prior to obtaining his PS3s , Khanna relied on grants from the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) to use various supercomputing sites spread across the United States " Typically I 'd use a couple hundred processors – going up to 500 – to do these same types of things . "
However , each of those supercomputer runs cost Khanna as much as $ 5,000 in grant money .
Eight 60 GB PS3s would cost just $ 3,200 , by contrast , but Khanna figured he would have a hard time convincing the NSF to give him a grant to buy game consoles , even if the overall price tag was lower .
So after tweaking his code this past summer so that it could take advantage of the Cell 's unique architecture , Khanna set about petitioning Sony for some help in the form of free PS3s .
" Once I was able to get to the point that I had this kind of performance from a single PS3 , I think that 's when Sony started paying attention , " Khanna says of his optimized code .
Khanna says that his gravity grid has been up and running for a little over a month now and that , crudely speaking , his eight consoles are equal to about 200 of the supercomputing nodes he used to rely on .
" Basically , it 's almost like a replacement , " he says .
" I do n't have to use that supercomputer anymore , which is a good thing . "
" For the same amount of money – well , I did n't pay for it , but even if you look into the amount of funding that would go into buying something like eight PS3s – for the same amount of money I can do these runs indefinitely . "
The point of the simulations Khanna and his team at UMass are running on the cluster is to see if gravitational waves , which have been postulated for almost 100 years but have never been observed , are strong enough that we could actually observe them one day .
Indeed , with NASA and other agencies building some very big gravitational wave observatories with the sensitivity to be able to detect these waves , Khanna 's sees his work as complementary to such endeavors .
Khanna expects to publish the results of his research in the next few months .
So while PS3 owners continue to wait for a fuller range of PS3 titles and low prices , at least they 'll have some reading material to pass the time .
A locomotive engineer spotted a man sitting on train tracks in Longmont early this morning and tried unsuccessfully to avoid running over the man , officials say .
Todd Hirsh , 34 , of Longmont was struck by the Burlington Northern Santa
Fe freight train pulling 76 cars at 3:11 a.m. in the 400 block of Atwood Street , according to Sgt. Mike Bell of the Longmont Police Department .
The southbound train did not come to a complete stop until it had gone another 75 feet after running over Hirsh , Bell said .
Longmont firefighters pulled Hirsh out from under the second engine of the train , he said .
Hirsh , who smelled of alcohol , was taken to a hospital with non-life - threatening injuries .
Hirsh has an extensive arrest record for thefts , burglary and drunken driving and was arrested Jan. 21 for investigation of a parole violation in Boulder County , according to Colorado Department of Corrections records .
He was convicted of a reduced charge of driving while ability impaired in October of 2002 .
The same month , he was sentenced to 18 months in prison on a motor vehicle theft conviction .
Then in April 2004 he was sentenced to three years in prison for a burglary conviction , according to records .

Report : Clinton strategist explodes at advertising team Michael Roston
Published : Thursday February 14 , 2008

Print This Email This After losing eight primary contests in a row to Senator Barack Obama , Senator Hillary Clinton 's staff has made some major leadership changes , with campaign chair Patti Solis Doyle and her top lieutenant Mike Henry stepping down .
But the changes may not have alleviated all the tensions with Clinton 's campaign .
A report in Thursday 's Wall Street Journal describes a major blow - out occurring between top advisers to Clinton last week .
" Clinton campaign operatives say it happened as top Clinton advisers gathered in Arlington , Va. , campaign headquarters to preview a TV commercial , " write Monica Langley and Amy Chozick .
" ' Your ad does n't work , ' strategist Mark Penn yelled at ad - maker Mandy Grunwald . "
Grunwald responded angrily , " ' Oh , it 's always the ad , never the message , " and they add , " The clash got so heated that political director Guy Cecil left the room , saying , ' I 'm out of here . ' "
But the campaign counters that its new head , Maggie Williams , is revitalizing Clinton 's presidential effort .
" Campaign aides say Ms. Williams and newcomers she brought from the old Clinton White House , such as Doug Sosnick and Steve Richetti , bring a needed jolt of energy , " Landley and Chozick say .
" Still , it 's possible the tumult , including the staff shakeup , could be just what the limping Clinton campaign needs .
John McCain dumped his campaign managers last summer when his candidacy seemed to be tanking .
Now he is the strong Republican front - runner . "
Solis Doyle resigned as Clinton 's campaign manager last weekend .
According to the report , she found her family had " grown accustomed " to her absence after her two months on the road .
" When her 6 - year - old son cried out one night recently , he rebuffed his mom , saying , ' I want Daddy , ' the Journal claims .
" Ms. Solis Doyle flew out of the room in tears and told her husband : ' Joey does n't want me .
S[ crew ] this campaign , I 'm quitting . '

Feb. 14 , 2008  --
A Canadian college professor spent three days in a coma over the weekend after losing consciousness in a New York sex club where he was left alone with a dog collar around his neck and a leather hood over his face , according to a report in the New York Post .
The man , identified by the Post as Robert Benjamin , 67 , was found passed out last Friday by a dominatrix in a sadomasochism club called the Nutcracker Suite .
The dominatrix noticed that his foot had turned blue after the high - heeled shoe he was wearing fell off , according to the exclusive report in the Post .
Law enforcement sources told the Post that Benjamin , whose fetish was to be bound in S&M gear and then left alone , lost consciousness when the oxygen flow to his brain was cut off while he was hanging from his arms .
Benjamin was rushed to Manhattan 's St. Vincent 's Hospital early that morning and regained consciousness Monday , promising to come clean to his wife and never engage in dangerous sex again , the Post reported .
St. Vincent 's confirmed on Wednesday that Benjamin was still in the hospital , but the Montreal native did not return calls from ABCNews.com placed to his hospital room .
Compared to a series of recent incidents in which practitioners of dangerous sex died to satisfy their kink , Benjamin , who was reportedly a regular at the club , was lucky .
Mixing Pleasure and Pain
Sadomasochism encompasses a broad swath of sexual interests , but always involves a certain degree of giving or receiving pain in the interest in sexual gratification .
In some cases , it can be deadly .
Last October , a medical examiner determined that the Rev. Gary Aldridge , a 51 - year - old Baptist minister from Alabama , died from accidental asphyxiation while pleasuring himself .
He was found wearing two wet suits , a face mask , diving gloves , slippers , rubberized underwear , two ties , five belts and eleven straps , according to the medical examiner 's report .
In April 2006 , British national Adrian Exley suffocated to death in the closet of a Rhode Island man whom he had met online .
Exley was wrapped tightly in heavy plastic and bound with duct tape , and a leather hood was over his head .
Gary LeBlanc , the man who tied Exley up , in a sex act both men had consented to , later committed suicide , according to The Associated Press .
The " Janus Report on Sexual Behavior , " one of the premiere academic surveys of sex practices , found in 1993 that 14 percent of men and 11 percent of women have had some sexual experience with sadomasochism .
But sadomasochism is difficult to define .
Some practitioners engaging in highly dramatized " play " that has more to do with theater than pain , while others look to be severely tortured , said Martin Weinberg , a sociologist at Indiana University who has studied sadomasochism clubs .
" There are two forms of SM .
One is a sociological phenomenon and is more about socializing with other people .
People go to a club for recreational , theatrical fun .
The other is a psychological phenomenon .
Something in someone 's biography leads them to seek out SM , " he said .
" Psychological cases get into heavy pain .
They pay for dominatrices and ask for extreme pain like having pins stuck in their scrotum .
People paying for dominatrices are not socializing with other people , they are in it purely for the pain , " he said .
The AP also reported on a case in which a man allegedly died under circumstances not unlike those that led to Benjamin slipping into a coma .
In January 2006 , dominatrix Barbara Asher , 56 , was acquitted of manslaughter in Massachusetts in the death of a man who allegedly suffered a fatal heart attack while strapped to a replica of a medieval torture device .
S&M Clubs Spring Up
Some forms of sadomasochism and the related fetish of bondage sex have gained a certain degree of normalcy .
Clubs have sprung up across the country along with shops catering to fetishists in most major cities .
Every year in San Francisco , some 400,000 people attend the Folsom Street Fair , an outdoor festival dedicated to the safer and more commercial aspect of sadomasochism , according to the event 's Web site .
" There are multiple organizations across the U.S. and internationally that educate people about safe play and kinky sex , " said Vincent Andrews , president of the National Leather Association , a network of S&M community organizations .
" Almost every major city in the U.S. has a BDSM ( bondage - sadomasochism ) event geared towards safe play , " he said .
But for some , " safe play " is the opposite of what they 're looking for .
Enhancing Orgasm
" Some people can not experience pleasure .
They can only experience deep feelings when they are truly painful , " said Judy Kuriansky , a sexologist and psychology professor at Columbia University .
" Everyone is looking for some sort of sensation .
For true masochists that experience becomes distorted and they can only feel something when it hurts . "
Kuriansky said masochism is more about power than sex and that events in one 's early childhood could prime a person to associate pain with sexual gratification .
In addition to pain , she said many masochists find pleasure in choking themselves or being choked , because the sudden rush of blood to the head can produce a euphoric high and enhance orgasm .
Benjamin told the Post that the experience of being comatose was enough to scare him off from dangerous sex in the future .
" It 's like when you crave turkey , " he told the paper .
" You eat it and you it and eat it , but you still want it .
But now I 've had enough .
I do n't want turkey anymore .
I 'm full … I do n't want to go to clubs anymore .
I 'm trying to learn to control myself and my emotions . "
But simply having a wake - up call , no matter how startling , is not always enough .
Kuriansky said it was rare for a masochist to finally become capable of associating sex with pleasure and love instead of pain and danger .
" There is a triumvirate of guilt , embarrassment and fear of intimacy for these people , " she said .
" It is rare that all of a sudden they can give up on being interested in pain and suddenly be capable of being loved . "

Nationally syndicated talk show host Charles Goyette uncovered blockbuster information in his drive - time interview with author David Ray Griffin .
A center piece of the increasingly apparent BULLSH*T story our government and corporate media have fed us for six long years was a complete fabrication !
We were fed a lie by Ted Olsen who served as Solictor General for the Bush Administration , when on 9/11 he held a press conference to tell America and the world that his dead wife had called him before her demise from the jet she was on that had just been hijacked .
Personally , I thought it was odd at the time that a man would decide to hold a press conference minutes after hearing of his own wife ’s death , when it happened on 9/11 .
If my own wife had just died , the last thing I ’d want to do would be to talk to anyone , let alone call a press conference .
It did n’t “ smell ” right .
Now we know why it did n’t smell right .
It was a lie .
The FBI has reported that no such call between Barbara Olsen and Ted Olsen ever took place on 9/11/2001 .
It was part of the rapidly unraveling scam that is the official story of 9/11 .
In fact , Griffin went on to explain that there is zero evidence that any hijackers had commandeered a plane at all .
True Bush believers will say , whao , wait a minute , we all know they did .
How do you know ?
Because Bush told you .
But , as Griffin rightly points out , in this interview , there is no “ EVIDENCE ” of their existence .

So the traders grabbed for their phones and started to put out any bad thoughts they could dream up about I.B.M .
They called journalists , retailers , anyone .
They sold huge amounts of I.B.M. short .
Soon , they had I.B.M. on the run , made money on their shorts and went to Langan ’s to drink champers .

As I see it , this is what traders do all day long  and especially what they ’ve been doing since the subprime mess burst upon the scene .
They have seized upon a fairly bad situation : a stunning number of defaults and foreclosures in the subprime arena , although just a small part of the total financial picture of the United States .
They have then tried  with the collaboration of their advance guards in the press  to make it seem like a total catastrophe so they could make money on their short sales .
They sense an opportunity to trick other traders and poor retail slobs like you and me , and they generate data and rumor to support their positions , and to make money .
MORE than that , they trade to support the way they want the market to go .
If they are huge traders like some of the major hedge funds , they can sell massively and move the market downward , then suck in other traders who go short , and create a vacuum of fear that sucks down whatever they are selling .
Note what is happening here :
They are not figuring out which way the market will go .
They are making the market go the direction they want .
I know this because I know traders .
They ’ve told me that they love to sell into fear because fear is bottomless  you can make money selling all day , while buying eventually slows because enthusiasm has limits .
The amount of money available to large professional traders is so large that they can overwhelm the market , at least for a while , anytime they want .
And they like to do it when the market least expects it .
To my humble eyes , this is what we have seen recently on world markets .
Note that the losses in United States markets alone are on the order of about $ 2.5 trillion in recent weeks .
How can a loss of roughly $ 100 billion on subprime  with some recoveries sure to come as property is seized and sold  translate into a stock - market loss 25 times that size ?
The answer is trader realism .
Detroit : second highest foreclosure rate in US
By Elisa Brehm
19 December 2007
The US subprime mortgage crisis is hitting Detroit with particular ferocity .
The home foreclosure rate in the hard - hit industrial city is now the second highest in the country , affecting one out of every 21 homeowners — eight times the national average .
During the 1950s when Detroit ’s Big Three automakers — General Motors , Ford and Chrysler — produced four out of five of the world ’s cars , the Motor City boasted the highest rate of home ownership of any major city in the US , along with the highest median income .
Factory workers , many of whom had migrated from impoverished rural and coal mining regions in the South and Appalachia , were according to popular myth living the American Dream .
Over the course of the ensuing decades the auto companies drastically downsized Detroit ’s manufacturing base , reducing the city to one of the poorest in the nation .
Since 2000 alone , the metropolitan area has lost 126,000 jobs .
This has combined with the bursting of the housing bubble to produce a social calamity .
In a few days , Mike Stone and his wife Melissa expect to be thrown out of their home in Redford , a nearby Detroit suburb where they have lived for 13 years .
The precarious nature of life in America is often demonstrated when an injury , accident , loss of a job or a cut in pay almost immediately produces a catastrophe for a worker and his family .
Melissa had a car accident last February and Mike lost his job .
His unemployment insurance has run out and he has been unable to find another job .
Melissa , who has been unable to work since her accident , expressed a sentiment heard over and over : “ We never expected anything like this would ever happen to us . ”
Shocked at the ordeal , she explained , “ Can you imagine , we are in our fifties and going through this ?
We have health insurance , so can you picture where we would be if we did n’t even have that ?
This is causing us so much stress and frustration . ”
In August alone , foreclosure notices were served on 260 homes a day .
A few weeks ago readers opening the Detroit Free Press found a 121 - page list of foreclosures published by the Wayne County treasurer ’s office .
More than 70,000 homes in metropolitan Detroit entered some phase of foreclosure between January 2006 and September 2007 , according to a Detroit News analysis of foreclosure data .
These figures represent a six - fold increase to what was already a record set by January 2006 .
Even this understates the real situation because those adjustable mortgages that will reset to a higher rate — causing another wave of foreclosures in March 2008 — are not included in the total .
The number of foreclosure filings in Wayne County — where Detroit is located — is 49,381 .
In neighboring Oakland County and Macomb County , the filings are 11,023 and 10,284 , respectively .
Behind these numbers stand as many as a quarter of a million people who are affected with the prospect of losing their homes , and with it everything for which they worked .
One thing is clear about the housing crisis .
The housing meltdown is impacting all sections of the working class population .
For example , in more affluent West Bloomfield Township located Oakland County , where the median household income is $ 110,000 and the median home value is $ 317,000 , there are 487 homes facing foreclosure .
In other once - stable Detroit suburbs in Oakland County — such as Southfield , Ferndale , Oak Park and Lathrup Village to name a few — the foreclosure predicament confronts thousands .
The statistics in Detroit provide a glimpse of the social crisis .
In the city as a whole the median household income is only $ 35,500 with median home values at $ 76,400 .
However , there are areas where conditions resemble a third world country .
In some neighborhoods , 1 in 7 homes received a foreclosure notice between January 2006 and September 2007 .
Helen Street is on the east side of Detroit , once home to several Chrysler plants .
On that street alone there are 83 homes in the process of foreclosure .
In that particular housing tract , the median household income is less than $ 25,000 and the homes are valued at $ 36,000 .
Behind these record - breaking numbers lies not a failing of personal or individual responsibility , but an immense social catastrophe brought about by the drive of the Wall Street banks and financial institutions to make enormous profits at the expense of working people .
From 2001 to 2005 , lenders loosened their standards making it easy to get a loan and encouraged mortgage brokers to sell loans in which the amount of money borrowed far exceeded the borrower ’s ability to repay it .
Many homebuyers were sold more costly loans by mortgage brokers who , very often , were rewarded with higher commissions and fees .
This fueled the growth of the subprime mortgage sector and also led to the proliferation of “ exotic ” ( speculative ) loans to people who would otherwise qualify for conventional debt instruments if the size of their mortgage were smaller .
Subprime mortgages account for about 55 percent of mortgages in the region .
Such loans are generally 3 percentage points higher than conventional rates available to those with good credit .
“ Subprime mortgages include features that increase the risk of foreclosure , ” noted a report produced by The Center for Responsible Lending .
The report noted an increasing share of loan products in the subprime market that limit the amount of equity a borrower builds .
“ These loans also carry a high risk of payment shock and may limit homeowners ’ ability to acquire the equity needed to refinance out of an unaffordable loan . ”
Typical for many workers is the situation facing Roz , an interior designer from Detroit .
She paid $ 7,000 in interest last year ; but her principle has remained at $ 62,000 after several refinances .
Now she is delinquent on her payments .
“ My first refinance , I took money out of the house to buy a new furnace and make other repairs .
I went into an adjustable rate in 2002 and the interest went up 11 percent .
We were forced into bankruptcy . ”
To save her home she is currently working three jobs .
“ There used to be the rich , middle class and poor .
But now the middle class is becoming poor .
It does n’t matter if you ’re white or black .
All working class people are going through the same thing .
We ’re all just one step from being on the corner asking for food and money . ”
On December 13 , state of Michigan officials held a forum on “ Avoiding Foreclosure ” in order to respond to the growing numbers who are at risk of losing their homes .
More than 4,000 attended the all - day event in downtown Detroit where lenders were present to meet with homeowners .
Only a small number received any relief .
Many were lectured about cutting their family budgets to make their house payments .
Many people who attended the event are substantially behind on their mortgage payments because of increased property taxes .
When a home is sold to a new owner , property taxes generally increase .
Few first - time borrowers are aware of this and the mortgage lenders do little to let them know .
Rickey Hussey , a 32 - year - old from St Clair Shores , is the father of four children , ages 1 , 4 , 13 and 15 .
He has lived in his home for a year and a half and saw his payments rise from $ 1,308 per month to $ 1,500 due to an increase in property taxes .
“ I lost my job as a chef which I had for 10 years , and I can not pay my mortgage .
My unemployment compensation begins tomorrow , but it does not seem to be enough . ”
There are a number of factors driving the foreclosing of subprime mortgage loans .
Most common are the adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) , which lured buyers in with teaser incentives but included built - in steep rate and payment increases .
These loans are sometimes called “ exploding ARMs ” because of the sharp increases that hit unsuspecting borrowers .
With a fall in home prices between 10 and 20 percent combined with a loss in income , many find it no longer possible to refinance , which was an option in the past to prevent foreclosure .
Daniel , 51 , drove from Memphis , Michigan to the forum looking for assistance .
He returned from Iraq six months ago where he served in the Air Force .
“ My income is now half of what I was making before I left .
My property value is down $ 65,000 — about 25 percent .
My lender is Washington Mutual .
I cannot tell you how many times I have called them only to be switched from person to person , from state to state .
I was told that it would be better to be 90 days in arrears and then they would talk to me .
Meanwhile all kinds of late fees are now involved .
And I can not refinance .
“ I am working two jobs and starting a third to try to keep my home .
Six years ago I got an ARM , which I was told was the next best thing to sliced bread .
This situation is very distressing .
What are we supposed to do ?
I cannot eat the bricks and the mortar . ”
Many people also relied on refinancing to get money out of their homes in order to cover rising living costs , particularly as wages and salaries either stagnated or decreased .
In the end , while the Wall Street banks and wealthy investors made a windfall , workers were left with crushing levels of personal debt .
Previously many workers found it difficult to get bank loans due to the uncertainty of their job status , inadequate income , or a poor credit history .
But all that changed as the Federal Reserve dropped interest rates and banks loosened credit restrictions .
Predatory lenders came on the scene offering deals that required no down payments or serious income documentation .
“ Liar loans ” is the term often used for such loans .
Borrowers were seduced into taking on ever larger amounts of debt with the unstated promise that real estate values would continue to rise and homeowners saw the “ equity ” in their homes rise , even though they paid little or nothing towards the principle on their loans .
Thelma Curtis faces foreclosure on a home she has lived in for 35 years .
“ The lenders came into my neighborhood pushing these ‘ balloon ’ mortgages .
They said your house might be worth $ 85,000 but we can get it appraised for $ 120,000 .
Without actually paying down the principle you owed this made it look like you had increased your equity in the house .
They even told me they would make a W - 2 ( income statement ) up in order for me to qualify for a loan .
“ I took money out , all of the equity in the house — like so many others — to help my grandson .
With all the money out of the house and the bank foreclosing on us — what is to become of us ?
“ The chickens are coming home to roost with this subprime mortgage scam .
This was not secretive ; you could see an atrocity was coming but it got a lot of people sucked in .
“ There should be a moratorium on payments to the banks to save peoples ’ homes .
We are suffering through an economic tsunami and there are not enough park benches in the state to accommodate all the homeless people that are being created . ”
A new type of stainless steel alloy developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory could allow for significantly increased operating temperatures and corresponding increases in efficiency in future energy production systems .
The new alloys offer superior oxidation resistance compared to conventional stainless steels , without significant increased cost or decreased creep resistance ( sagging at high temperature ) .
What sets this proprietary material apart from other stainless steels is its ability to form protective aluminum oxide scales instead of chromium oxide scales .
The combination of creep and oxidation resistance offered by these alloys previously was available only with nickel - base alloys , which are about five times more costly than the new stainless steels .
This material also has potential applications in high - temperature ( up to 800 degrees Celsius ) chemical and process industry applications .
The material was reported on in the April 20 issue of Science .

@djdare :
I perfectly understand your point .
In fact , I 've been advocating for such a model ever since Apple started the iTunes music store ( not that any of you would know about it , but hey ) .
Essentially , to those who buy music through iTMS , what label / record company published that music is pretty much irrelevant .
It would be absolutely beneficial for artists if by signing with the Apple / iTunes label , Apple only takes the same or marginally higher cut from the sales as they are now , and the artists get to keep the rest .
Basically , cutting out the middlemen , who are the record co .
Of course , there is the off chance that all Apple wants to do is take the place of the big labels , become the evil empire itself@djdare :

Of course , there is the off chance that all Apple wants to do is take the place of the big labels , become the evil empire itself , and ( 1 ) alienate all the other labels , like many people have pointed out , and ( 2 ) giving other companies to take it down , as Apple took down the biggies itself .
They'd be fuckin ' stupid to even try to pull that off , but sure , the possibility exists .
But let 's wait before we make that judgment , eh ?
DES MOINES  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s appearances are not billed as anything so conventional as mere “ rallies ” or “ town meetings ” or “ speeches . ”
In the last 10 days , Mrs. Clinton has presided over “ Moms and Daughters Making History ” events , “ Time to Pick a President ” events , “ Working for Change , Working for You ” events , “ The Hillary I Know ” events and “ Every County Counts ” events .
She rarely names her chief competitors for the Democratic presidential nomination , but their presence looms .
“ Some people think you can hope for change , ” she said at one recent event , in a jab at Senator Barack Obama of Illinois .
“ Some people think you can just demand it , ” she added , in a swipe at former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina .
“ I think you do it by working really , really hard , ” she said , before going on to catalog her résumé .
As Mr. Obama , Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards try  ever so politely  to eviscerate one another in the final few days before the Iowa caucuses on Thursday , the flavor and substance of their competing performances reveal a basic cultural , thematic and stylistic divide in their campaigns , their supporters and themselves .
War Graffiti
These images were taken in October 2005 at Al Udeid Air Base , Qatar in an attempt to document what is likely one of the largest concentration of graffiti by U.S. & Coalition military members in recent years .
This graffiti appeared in a semi- permanent structure that serves as a holding area for individuals flying into and out of Southwest Asia .
Most passengers are transiting to the U.S. military base called Camp As Sayliyah , located in Doha , Qatar .
It serves as a makeshift R&R site for U.S. personnel serving in Southwest & Central Asia .
Photography is essentially frowned upon by the U.S. military and is actually forbidden on most bases overseas .
Interestingly enough , writing graffiti is also against regulation , as it is considered vandalism and defacement of government property .
While I waited for a flight in this makeshift holding area , no one added to the graffiti , but based on the amount of writing , thousands of people had done just that .
Perhaps each a small form of protest or merely an expression of defiance and futility that often permeates a war zone .

Reporter : Giuliani tossed my crying baby ' like a football ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The good news is that none of the 2008 presidential candidates have ' butter fingers . '
In the course of the New Hampshire primary , Darren Garnick , a writer for Slate.com . , set out on a quest to photograph his 5 - month - old daughter Dahlia being held by every one of the candidates .
Darren and his wife Stacy appeared on CNN on Monday to describe the results and show off some of the photos .
Barack Obama held little Dahlia like someone who knows his way around babies , cradling her securely and looking into her eyes .
" I would vote for him just for that , " was Stacy 's comment on the photo .
Hillary Clinton also got a top score from Garnick .
" Hillary 's a natural , " he said .
" She was very warm . "
In the photo with Rudy Giuliani , however , Dahlia is wailing and Giuliani seems almost as upset .
" Rudy was n't happy , " said Garnick .
" Dahlia smiled for the first two seconds and then she started crying and Rudy was panicky .
...
He did n't want to be photographed with a screaming baby .
... He tossed her right back to me like a football . "
Dahlia also cried when John McCain held her , but McCain is laughing about it in the photo .
" I do think it 's significant to compare the personalities of McCain and Giuliani , " said Garnick .
" When the baby started to cry with Giuliani , Giuliani basically shoved the baby back in my face .
When the baby cried with McCain , McCain was like , ' Okay , I got a crying baby . '
And he made a joke that ' there goes another vote . ' "
" I think you can tell a lot about candidates ' personalities by how they hold the baby , " Garnick concluded , " but I do n't think you can say whether they 're going to be a good president whether she cries or not .
But she did tend to cry more with the Republicans than with the Democrats . "
Garnick 's full slideshow can be seen here .

How I built an effective blog comment spam blocker
Mention comment spam and most people , in particular those crazy WordPress users , mention Akismet .
Great tool and I have nothing against it but I wanted to build my own , avoiding the external call to the Akismet service .
What has been interesting to see , is just how effective it is .
Turns out , my spammers are quite obvious .
As you might see , I do n't use CAPTCHAs and I do n't use JavaScript detection .
I just use a number of rules that validate each comment on the server .
Oh , and I do n't use nofollow .
Points System
I use a points system , which I got the idea from Movable Type , whose spam protection is also based on a points system .
For everything in a comment that I like , you get a point .
For everything I do n't like , you lose a point ( or two , or three ) .
If you get a 1 or higher , you 've made it on the site as a valid comment .
If you get a 0 , it 's set for moderation and I 'll take a look at it .
If it 's below 0 , it 's marked as spam and I 'll never see it ( although I check every couple weeks just in case a legitimate comment needs to be unflagged ) .
If it falls below - 10 , I do n't even bother saving it to the database since it is so obviously spam .
Types of Spam
There are two main types of spam : automated and manual .
Automated spam is the most obvious .
There are a number of tricks they try to pull and stands out when you see the same message a dozen times posted within seconds of each other .
Automated spam is also the easiest to catch .
So insanely simple that just a few rules would catch about 95 % of all comment spam hitting a server .
( That percentage may even be higher ... I 'm just guessing ) .
Manual spam , on the other hand , is more devious .
People actually try and respond to the article at hand , which makes it slightly harder to catch .
I say slightly because the vast majority of manual spammers do such a poor job at leaving a comment that they stand out like a sore thumb .
The remaining few are usually the ones you end up filtering by hand .
Quick Solution
The quickest solution to reducing the amount of comment spam you get , and does n't require any server - side programming and is built into almost all blogging tools , is to simply turn off the comments on a post after a certain amount of time .
It works quite well and here are the two major reasons why :
Automated spam has a database of pages to which they try to submit to .
If the form is no longer there then you do n't get spam .
Spammers are forced to discover new pages in which to spam .
Manual spam often tries to hit pages that have higher page ranks .
There 's plenty of search engine tools to help people look this information up .
( I 'd actually see referrers from these search tools , followed shortly by a new blog comment . )
Higher page ranks will happen on older and popular posts .
By shutting down the comment form , manual spammers are left to target newer pages in the hopes of getting missed until the page gets a higher ranking .
I 've had old posts that I left the comments open for years and would still see users come across it and add to the discussion in meaningful ways .
I loved that .
However , that almost never happens now .
So , I finally gave in and just close comments .
The Rules
In a blog comment , there are 5 fields and I test each one separately and in various combinations for various rules .
The fields are : body , email , author name , url , and ip .
Here now are my rules for filtering blog comments .
How many links are in the body More than 2 - 1 point per link Less than 2 +2 points
How long is the body More than 20 characters and there 's no links + 2 points Less than 20 characters - 1 point Number of previous comments from email Approved comments + 1 point per Marked as spam - 1 point per Keyword search Levitra , viagra , casino , etc. - 1 point per URLs that have certain words or characters in them .html , .info , ? , & or free - 1 point per URLs that have certain TLDs .de , .pl , or .cn ( sorry guys ) - 1 point URL length More than 30 characters - 1 point Body starts with ...
Interesting , Sorry , Nice or Cool. - 10 points
Author name has http:// in it - 2 points per Body used in previous comment - 1 point per Random character match 5 consonants - 1 point per
Once you have a database of spam messages , you can observe certain patterns .
In checking some information from time to time , I discovered some interesting stats :
Body length
Write something of consequence .
If it 's less than 20 characters , you obviously do n't have much to say .
URL matches
Most people who include a URL usually have a top level domain or a subdomain that they use .
They 're not using querystring parameters or any other crazy URL structures .
And I 'm sorry for all the German , Polish or Chinese but a few of your fellow countrymen are n't being very nice .
URL Length
URLs that are longer than 30 characters are almost always spam .
This ties in with the last filter .
If you 've got a URL , it 's short , sweet and sexy .
It 's not crazy long — although I have seen some crazy long , perfectly legitimate URLs .
Body matches
It may seem like I 'm being overly severe on people who start their comments like this but it's a very specific pattern that I 'm matching .
I was getting 10 to 20 hits of the same message coming in .
It was just easier to match the messages and essentially ban them .
Random character matches
The other thing I noticed was email addresses or author names that were just a random string of characters .
If there 's no vowels , sure you might be Polish but more likely that you 're spam .
Rarely do even the Polish have 5 consonants in a row !
Effective ?
How effective has it been ?
These days , I only see a new spam message get through maybe once every week or two .
It 's usually a message that somebody has handtyped to be relevant to the page but the comment is near useless and their author name is most evidently spam .
I 've also reworded the disclaimer text under the submit box to let people know that I 'm actively on the look out for spam and even legitimate comments will get edited or marked as spam if they plan to abuse the system .
This lets those people know — like those who like to leave signatures on a blog comment or who like to use their company name as their author name — that being underhanded will not be rewarded .
Despite my past frustration with spam , things are at a point now where I 'm happy to leave comments open on recent posts for a couple weeks and then just close them up and never have to worry about them again .
It certainly is n't the death of comments I thought it might need to come to .
Why is that when I hear this :
Blackwater USA -- the company at the center of a brewing storm over private contractors -- is n't letting a little controversy get them down .
No , they 're focused on expansion , and the latest addition is a ship that can be used for everything from anti-terrorism to special operations missions .
The McArthur , a 183 - ft. ship that boasts " state of the art navigation systems , full GMDDSS communications , SEATEL Broadband , dedicated command and control bas , helicopter decks , hospital and multiple support vessel capabilities . "
Under the new banner of " Blackwater Maritime Solutions , " the world 's most notorious merc outfit private security contractor now has the three " services : " Land , Air and Sea . -- wired.com
It makes me think of this :
Scientology 's Sea Org was going to take over those areas controlled by Smersh ( the fictitious evil organization fought by the equally fictitious James Bond ) , rake in enormous amounts of cash , clean up psychotherapy , infiltrate and reorganize every minority group , and befriend the worst enemies of the Western nations .
Hubbard 's stated intention was to undermine a supposed Fascist conspiracy to rule the world .
Hubbard had three vessels , Apollo ( formly known as the Scotsman ) , Athena and yacht Diana , and during the last months of 1968 all three joined up in Corfu , Greece .
The ships were berthed in Corfu when people were first being tossed into the harbor .

It has n't seemed to have occurred to Congress yet , but it seems to me that Hauptsturmführer Erik Prince ain't the sharpest tool in the shed iffen ya get my meaning and I know you do .
Must be all the inbreeding .
We 've definitely heard some horror stories about Best Buy , but it looks like a DC woman named Raelyn Campbell has had enough : she 's opening up a big can of America Sauce on the retailer in the form of a $ 54 m lawsuit after it lost her laptop during warranty service .
Campbell says she bought a laptop and $ 300 extended warranty from Best Buy in 2006 , and took the machine in for service when the power switch broke last May .
Told repairs would take two to six weeks , she set off on a business trip , only to find that her laptop had gone missing when she returned in August .
Fast forward through several more weeks of run-around and delays , and the best the Buy would offer for losing a $ 1,100 machine with all her data on it was a $ 900 gift card .
After being informed of the potential for identity theft , Campbell filed the multimillion - dollar suit , which prompted Best Buy to up its offer to a whopping $ 2,100 plus a $ 500 gift card .
Campbell says she 's not dropping the case until she finds out what happened to her machine -- and she wants ol '
Blue to train its employees on privacy issues and revamp its warranty policy .
Honestly ?
We 'd say she has a better chance of getting the $ 54 million .

Phil from the UK anti-ID - register group NO2ID sends in this nugget — note the call to action there .
We 've got a sensitive government document revealing the British government 's plan to trick us into a database state and we need as many copies as possible , as quickly as possible !
If you mirror this document , please add a link to it in the comments for the post .
UK campaigners NO2ID this morning enlisted the help of bloggers across the
world to spread a leaked government document describing how the British
government intends to go about " coercing " its citizens onto a National
Identity Register .
The ' ID card ' is revealed as little more than a cover to
create a official dossier and trackable ID for every UK resident – creating
what NO2ID calls ' the database state ' .
NO2ID 's national coordinator , Phil Booth , exhorted bloggers , freedom lovers
and anyone who gives a damn about personal privacy to mirror the annotated
document on their site .
" The charade is over .
While ministers try to bamboozle the British public
with fairytales about fingerprints , officials are plotting how to dupe and
bully the population into surrendering control of their own identities . "
" Biometric ID cards are a sham ; a magician 's flourish to cover the biggest
identity fraud there has ever been . "

OpenMoko today announced the Neo FreeRunner , a mass - market version of the Neo 1973 open - source phone , and will be showing it off at CES next week .
The phone will have the same " overall look and feel " as the developers ' product , but it has a faster 500MHz processor , 3D graphics , and a new lineup of open - source mobile apps .
It 's a GSM tri-band world phone with either 850MHz or 900MHz on the low end , and it has 802.11b/ g as well for hotspot action .
Oh , and it will also have motion sensors for gesture - based activity .
Pretty cool stuff , but as yet , there 's no pricing or availability announced .
Stay tuned , or jump for the press release .
OpenMoko Unveils Neo FreeRunner
New subsidiary of FIC previews consumer version of its highly acclaimed open source Neo mobile phone
TAIPEI , TAIWAN , January 3 , 2008 - OpenMoko , originators of the Neo 1973 , the world 's first totally open mobile phone that continues to receive critical acclaim from the Free and Open Source ( FOSS ) developer community , will unveil the Neo FreeRunner , a version of the phone tailored for mass market consumers .
Neo FreeRunner , based on the same free and open source principles as the Neo 1973 , will be previewed at the press - only Lunch @ Piero 's technology showcase event during CES 2008 .
Maintaining the overall look and feel of the developers '
Neo 1973 , the Neo FreeRunner features hardware improvements such as 2D/3D graphics and a faster 500MHz processor that boosts performance to enable video and audio processing , as well as a new generation of mobile applications emerging from the open source community .
Designed for worldwide use , FreeRunner will come in two versions : a 850MHz tri- band and a 900 Mhz tri-band .
Neo FreeRunner will also integrate WiFi ( 802.11 b/g ) for online access anywhere , and will include motion sensors that will cue functions based on detected user activity .
The original Neo 1973 sold out within three days of its introduction in July 2007 , giving open source developers and hackers a hardware and software platform to build a completely new mobile device for both vertical markets and consumers .
Neo FreeRunner builds on and expands that success .
" FreeRunner 's a significantly improved device from the Neo 1973 .
Our developers gave us great feedback as they explored the first version of the device , " said Steven Mosher , VP marketing , Openmoko .
" We added WiFi , motion sensors , faster processing , and improved graphics , creating a compelling mass market device for open source development .
The open source community was key in achieving that goal .
Without them this remix of the Neo would not have been possible "
Developers who bought the Neo 1973 have been eagerly awaiting announcement of the latest Neo sequel .
To foster FreeRunner development for mainstream Java applications and Java developers , OpenMoko partnered with Jalimo , the open source project driven by the German software development company Tarent GmbH .
Hanno Wendt , Partner Manager and spokesman for Jalimo : " the Neo 1973 was a great launch vehicle for us .
We got the device and had our Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) running in no time .
We are confident our bring up on FreeRunner will go just as smoothly . "
The FreeRunner will be previewed at CES and ship later this spring — first to developers and then to end users as software for the new hardware features becomes available .

Drum Brain Update

Drum Brain Released !
Over the past few months , I 've been working hard on releasing an update to Drum Machine .
I 've been torn about this for a while , since it 's very difficult to judge how big the music - game community is these days .
Regardless , judging by the reaction of the poll I had my site ( and some emails I received ) I figured it was worthwhile to work on a follow - up .
DrumBrain was only ever going to be a tracker , and an answer to the poor latency issues that made Drum Machine frustrating to use for some .
I 've fixed the latency issues , and after I completed the tracker , I thought it would be pretty awesome to make a drum tutor , so people could learn some basics about drumming .
And then I thought it would be neat to add some mini-games , and even a Rockband - style mode that allows you to notate your favourite songs , and send the notation file to your friends to play .
The only question is interest level .
So , I 'm planning to see how DrumBrain sells initially , and go from there .
If enough people want more functionality , I 'll add it .
Check out DrumBrain here .

A top woman tennis coach was caught in bed with a 13 - year - old girl after starting a lesbian affair with the child star , a court heard yesterday .
Claire Lyte , 29 , allegedly took advantage of the youngster while coaching her at one of the Lawn Tennis Association 's academies for talented children .
The relationship was revealed when the girl 's mother found her daughter and Lyte naked in bed together , a jury was told .
Lyte , who is accused of sexual activity with a child , denies any sexual contact with the girl , who was described as one of the leading tennis talents of her age .
Instead , she claims the girl 's ' ambitious and pushy ' mother concocted the allegations to spite her when her daughter failed to reach her potential and left the Loughborough academy .
Liverpool Crown Court heard that the girl became infatuated with Lyte and sent her intimate text messages , claiming she loved and wanted to marry the blonde coach .
She wrote a love ' contract ' to Lyte , referring to herself as the coach 's ' babyface ' and promising to love her for ever .
Her feelings , the jury were told , were reciprocated .
Lyte and the girl shared hotel rooms when away at tournaments and were seen using the same toilet cubicle .
Lyte even started wearing the girl 's clothes and adopted her ' style ' , the court heard .
Peter Davies , prosecuting , said : " The relationship between coach and student transcended the boundaries of a normal coach - player relationship .
" The defendant was attracted to the girl and it seems that the attraction between adult and teenager became mutual .
" Instead of realising the true implications of the situation and maintaining a professional approach , the defendant took advantage of the difference in years and maturity and fostered a relationship with the pupil . "
The court heard that Lyte is a former professional tennis player who played at Wimbledon and reached 101 in the world rankings .
When she was forced to retire through injury , she became a coach at the LTA 's Loughborough academy for aspiring tennis stars , and was named LTA young coach of the year in 2001 .
The court heard that the affair began in May 2005 , six months after the girl started being coached by Lyte at the centre .
It was allegedly discovered in October 2005 when the girl 's mother came home unexpectedly early from a party one Sunday afternoon and caught her daughter and Lyte in bed together .
Scroll down for more ...
Yesterday , the jury was shown a recording of the girl 's interview with police .
She sobbed as she said : " My mum came back and we did something that should n't have happened .
" I do n't know what to call it .
It was something sexual . "
Mr Davies said that according to the girl , a consensual sex act took place .
When her mother arrived home , she noticed two pairs of trainers at the top of the stairs .
She went to the girl 's bedroom where she found them in bed together engaged in a sex act .
" There followed lengthy arguments between them , during which the defendant said she cared for and was in love with the girl , " said Mr Davies .
Instead of reporting Lyte to police over the alleged incident , the girl 's mother allowed her daughter to continue her training at the academy .
She made a formal complaint only ten months later , in August 2006 , after Lyte told her that her daughter 's tennis career was not progressing .
Police searched Lyte 's home and discovered a pair of the girl 's knickers , with traces of the coach 's DNA on them .
They also found a love ' contract ' in the girl 's handwriting hidden in Lyte 's bedroom .
In the document , the girl pledged to : " Never be with anyone else .
Never lie to you again .
Always be here for you .
" Always be your babyface .
Be a good baby , not a bad one .
Try hard when I 'm on court .
" Be with you for ever .
Never let you go .
Never lose you .
Do chores in our little house when we get one .
" Look after you and love you for ever and just be with you . "
The girl told police Lyte took the lead in the relationship and she was frightened to speak out because it might have jeopardised her tennis coaching .
Asked what she thought of the affair , the girl added : " It was wrong .
I 'm too little , too young .
She should have known better . "
Interviewed by police , Lyte , from Shirley , near Solihull , West Midlands , denied the affair .
She claimed she was heterosexual and that the girl 's mother made up the allegations to get her sacked because her daughter 's tennis career was faltering .
Lyte denies five counts of sexual activity with a child between May 2005 and June last year .
The case continues .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - For many Japanese children , a cell phone is a social lifeline they can’t imagine being without .
For high school student Makoto , it became an instrument of mental torture that nearly drove him to suicide .
Makoto , who requested that his last name not be used , poses for a photograph as he looks at his cell phone which became an instrument of mental torture that nearly drove him to suicide when he was a high school student in Tokyo October 22 , 2007 .
For many Japanese children , a cell phone is a social lifeline they can't imagine being without .
Cyber bullying is a global problem , but in Japan it is almost endemic due to rampant bullying in schools .
REUTERS / Yuriko Nakao
“ Even when I stopped going to school and stayed at home , my cell phone kept ringing with harassing e-mails , ” said Makoto , who became anorexic and rarely emerged from his room for nearly half a year after becoming the target of “ cyber bullying ” .
Makoto , now 19 and working as a hair stylist after graduating from high school , said classmates posted photos of him along with insults on a Web site and e-mailed him at all hours telling him to die .
He attempted suicide twice .
“ When people tell you your life is not worth living , you start to think that way , ” said Makoto , who requested that his last name not be used .
“ I could n’t believe in human beings anymore . ”
Schoolyard bullying has long bedeviled Japan and , as in other countries , has taken a high - tech twist in recent years .
Ten percent of high school students said they have been harassed through e-mails , websites or blogs , a recent survey by the Hyogo Prefectual Board of Education showed .
Cyber bullying is a global trend , but the anonymity it provides for perpetrators may have extra significance in Japan , where wariness of direct confrontation is a cultural norm , said Shaheen Shariff , principal investigator for the International Project on Cyber Bullying at McGill University in Canada .
“ Something is falling through the cracks , so they need to address what the problem is , ” she said in a phone interview .

“ Are they ( children ) too controlled , are they under too much pressure to be academically successful , do they have an avenue to express their feelings ... are those taboos ? ”
Shariff said .
BULLYING IN CYBER DARKNESS
Most cyber bullying in Japan , where 96 percent of high school students have their own cell phone , is conducted through mobile phones with Internet and e-mailing capabilities .
Common methods include e-mailing pictures showing victims ’ genitals to classmates and posting insults on class Web sites .
Experts say high - tech bullying is far harder for parents and teachers to police than physical violence because of the anonymity of cyber space and a lack of technical knowledge .
“ Schools often do not have Internet - savvy teachers , and parents cannot control or see what is going on in the cyber world , ” said Yasukawa of the National Web Counseling Conference .
“ No one knows what is going on . ”
The obscurity of cyber bullying is making the problem of bullying , which schools have long been accused of sweeping under the carpet , even harder to address .
The problem drew public attention in July , when an 18 - year - old boy leapt to his death at his high school in Kobe , western Japan , after classmates posted a nude photo of him on a Web site and repeatedly sent him e-mails demanding money .
The school first denied bullying had occurred and only admitted that was the case after some of the teen ’s classmates were arrested .
“ Things that should n’t have happened are secretly settled and hidden by schools as if they never took place , ” said Chiharu Utsumi , a representative of the Association for the Bereaved by School Accidents and Events , whose 11 - year - old son committed suicide 13 years ago after being beaten by his teacher at school .
Education ministry surveys from 1999 to 2005 reported no suicides related to bullying , but the ministry decided earlier this year to review 16 cases that took place over the six year period .
Some Japanese schools and parents are already using e-mail filtering software and special settings on cell phones and computers that protect children from harassment by blocking messages sent through suspect servers or IP addresses .
But experts agree that the solution to cyber - bullying requires more than the latest technology .
“ In terms of technology , e-mail filtering systems are effective , ” said Motohiro Hasegawa , associate professor of Department of Information and Culture at Kinjo Gakuin University .
“ But in the end , the problem is not about technology -- it is about humans . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York City prosecutors on Tuesday endorsed the United States ’ first proposed law to ban registered sex offenders from social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace , officials said .

The district attorneys from all five of the city ’s boroughs announced their support for New York state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ’s proposal , which would ban thousands of the state ’s sex offenders from communicating with minors online .
The latest of several initiatives taken by Cuomo ’s office , the law would force sexual predators to register their instant messaging screen names and enable sites like MySpace and Facebook to block their access .
“ The playground today is the Internet , ” Cuomo told a news conference .
“ The same way where we want to know their addresses , we want to know where they live on cyberspace . ”
MySpace is part of Rupert Murdoch ’s NewsCorp and home to 110 million users globally .
It came under state legal scrutiny after some youth members fell prey to adult predators posing as minors .
Last month , MySpace and 49 U.S. state attorneys general agreed on a broad set of guidelines for protecting youths , including developing an e-mail registry that would allow parents to prohibit their children from creating an online profile for the network .
Facebook , a privately held smaller rival , in October agreed with Cuomo to settle a child - safety probe in which the site promised to address within 24 hours any complaint about inappropriate content and allow an independent examiner to oversee how it handles complaints .
Both firms support the newly proposed restrictions , Cuomo said .
“ They want to be able to tell parents , ‘ Come to this site because it is a safe site ’ , ” Cuomo said .
Cuomo ’s bill called the Electronic Security and Targeting of Online Predators Act ( e - STOP ) was introduced into the New York state legislature with bipartisan support last week .
According to Cuomo ’s office , if passed , the law would be the first in a U.S. state that expressly bans convicted sex offenders from contacting minors on social networking sites .

I 'd really like to open this week with a live interview with my wife , the successful zero - gravity choreographer who has just come back from a trip to heaven at the end of the year 07 .
Sadly , she has begged off -- she 's still in the middle of doing interviews for news media , dance media , science fiction media , and she 's really beginning to hear herself answer the same questions over and over again .
So I 'm going to open right now with a little bit of time travel , back to the late 80's when Jeanne and I are having one of the very few disagreements that we ever had over the course of our collaboration on the STARDANCE TRILOGY .

11/16/07 - MELANCHOLY ELEPHANTS by Spider Robinson
© 1983 Spider Robinson
She sat zazen , concentrating on not concentrating , until it was time to prepare for the appointment .
Sitting seemed to produce the usual serenity , put everything in perspective .
Her hand did not tremble as she applied her make - up ; tranquil features looked back at her from the mirror .
She was mildly surprised , in fact , at just how calm she was , until she got out of the hotel elevator at the garage level and the mugger made his play .
She killed him instead of disabling him .
Which was obviously not a measured , balanced action -- the official fuss and paperwork could make her late .
Annoyed at herself , she stuffed the corpse under a shiny new Westinghouse roadable whose owner she knew to be in Luna , and continued on to her own car .
This would have to be squared later , and it would cost .
No help for it -- she fought to regain at least the semblance of tranquillity as her car emerged from the garage and turned north .
Nothing must interfere with this meeting , or with her role in it .

The first thing I did when I woke next morning was to sit down at my desk and summon a list of Positions Available .
There were a lot more than I expected .
It had apparently occurred to the expedition 's planners that not only could nearly all the actual useful work of preparing to start this colony be safely put off until the last few years of the voyage ... it probably would be anyway , humans being human .
Therefore , it would be good to keep them all occupied doing some damn thing or other for the first eighteen or so years .
Lots of helpful suggestions had been provided .
The full list of jobs the Colonial Authority was willing to pay someone to do took well over three hours just to scroll down through at normal reading speed .

SPACE GENERATION
© 2007 by Spider Robinson ; all rights reserved
The first thing “ space generation ” makes me think of is the quantum ramjet , a hypothetical star drive I chose as the motive force for the starship Charles Sheffield in VARIABLE STAR , my new collaboration with Robert A. Heinlein .
It would make use of quantum fluctuations in the energy of the cosmic vacuum to propel a ship up to relativistic speeds quickly , without burning any fuel .
No such engine has been built yet — but the engineer who proposed it , David Froning , mentioned parenthetically that if a quantum ramjet were ever built , it might very well create new universes , every second it was in operation , as a side effect .
It ’s kind of hard to top that for space generation .

Jinny phoned two days later , about eight hours before we left .
Theoretically she should not have been able to .
I 'd contributed my phone to the ship 's recycler on arrival , and gotten a new one - under a false name , using nonexistent credit , and paying a premium for a super - unlisted code .
That account would vanish like a bubble when the first bill went unpaid , of course .
But by then I expected I would no longer need one .
I only needed it now to say goodbye to a few friends and acquaintances , and to dispose of my few remaining assets on Ganymede .

Ask Elliot Ness .
The power of a law — its meaning — depends on who ’s committed to enforcing it , and how far they ’re prepared to go .
In David Milch ’s HBO series Deadwood , nobody seems prepared to enforce much of anything , and perhaps you ’ve seen the dire consequences of such anarchy : the rights of prostitutes were not respected , men were sometimes cheated , wealth and power and information lay in the hands of a few , undertaking was handled by voracious swine , and foul language was heard in public .
Nothing like the shining civilization of laws we enjoy today .

Like the fabulous Conrad compound , my apartment was mostly underground , and did not appear on any map .
But there the similiarities ended .
For one thing , it was not located in the middle of a glacier somewhere , but smack in the midst of some of the most densely populated land in the U.S.N.A. , the White Rock district of Greater Vancouver .
For another , it was the polar opposite of opulent or luxurious , as comfortable as a coffin .
Vancouver itself has a tradition of quasilegal " basement suites " dating back centuries to some World 's Fair , or perhaps Olympics , but outlying suburbs like White Rock acquired theirs so recently that they 're still illegal , hence unrecorded , hence unregulated , hence mostly shitholes .
In sharp contrast to Conradville , it had only a single virtue to recommend it .
But right then , that virtue rated high in my scale of values : it was mine .

It ’s probably apocryphal — the best ones usually are — but one of my favorite quotations is what Mahatma Ghandi is supposed to have responded when asked what he thought of Western Civilization .
They say he replied gently , “ That would be very nice . ”
A lot of people will give you some variant of that same response if you ask them about space art .
“ Great idea .
Somebody should try that . ”
“ What space art ? ” I draw blanks with the idea all the time at social gatherings .
Nobody seems to realize there is any .

The room was not small , but smaller than I had expected , and further surprised me by being furnished more like a den or a study than an office .
At the far end of the room was a conversational grouping of four chairs .
Rennick was just reaching the leftmost of the two that faced away from me .
The two facing toward me were already occupied .
In each sat a man who appeared to be approximately Rennick 's age .
The fourth chair , its back to me , was obviously the hot seat .

The spiritual impulse can be a dangerous thing when it goes public .
Ask anyone who was in New York five years ago , or anyone still alive in Baghdad today ...
It ’s hard to talk about spirituality without talking about religion , and most of the world ’s religions are , whether they admit it or not , mutually exclusive .

The engine did not explode .
It did n't even sound any louder than usual .
The Mounties somehow failed to notice us blazing across their radar , or to log any complaints about shattered windows ; we crossed the province unmolested .
For most of the trip we were above atmosphere , so high that the horizon showed a distinct curve - we pretty much had to be at that speed , I think - but if the Peace Forces satellites noticed us , they kept it to themselves .
Nineteen minutes later , the car finished decelerating , came to a dead stop and went into hover mode , glowing softly from the heat of our passage and reentry into atmosphere .

SUSTAINING THE THRILL
© 2006 by Spider Robinson ; all rights reserved
Sustaining the planet means widely different things to all of us — so let ’s try and define
our aim .
The phrase surely is n’t meant literally .
Terra was sustaining herself just fine for millions
of years before the first oxygen - producing lifeforms infested her and wrecked her nice
methane ecosystem , dooming entire phyla to extinction .
Mother Gaia ’s not alarmed by
“ global warming ” : she ’s survived vastly greater environmental changes more than once ,
and will again .

I thought I wanted to get married in the worst way .
Then that 's pretty much what I was offered , so I ended up going trillions of kilometers out of my way instead .
A great many trillions of kilometers , and quite a few years - which turns out to be much the greater distance .

LET’S START WASTING MONEY IN SPACE
© 2006 by Spider Robinson ; all rights reserved
I ’ve spent several decades rebutting silly complaints about “ money wasted in space . ”
Dollars have been spent getting there — but every single buck stopped here , on the ground , in the pocket of some smart person .
Furthermore , every dollar NASA spent earned thirteen dollars back .
Look what it got them : a manned space program that barely exists and has little future .

Inferno® is a distributed operating system , originally developed at Bell Labs , but now developed and maintained by Vita Nuova® as Free Software .
Applications written in Inferno's concurrent programming language , Limbo , are compiled to its portable virtual machine code ( Dis ) , to run anywhere on a network in the portable environment that Inferno provides .
Unusually , that environment looks and acts like a complete operating system .
The use of a high - level language and virtual machine is sensible but mundane .
The interesting thing is the system 's representation of services and resources .
They are represented in a file - like name hiearchy .
Programs access them using only the file operations open , read / write , and close .
The ' files ' may of course represent stored data , but may also be devices , network and protocol interfaces , dynamic data sources , and services .
The approach unifies and provides basic naming , structuring , and access control mechanisms for all system resources .
A single file - service protocol ( called Styx or 9P2000 ) makes all those resources available for import or export throughout the network in a uniform way , independent of location .
An application simply attaches the resources it needs to its own per-process name hierarchy ( ' name space ' ) .
The system can be used to build portable client and server applications .
It makes it straightforward to build lean applications that share all manner of resources over a network , without the cruft of much of the ' Grid ' software one sees .
Inferno can run ' native ' on various ARM , PowerPC , SPARC and x86 platforms but also ' hosted ' , under an existing operating system ( including FreeBSD , Irix , Linux , MacOS X , Plan 9 , and Solaris ) , again on various processor types .
( description copied from google code project )
Besides being a new runtime environment , Inferno offers a number of applications which should run out of the box :
multimedia ( audio player , mpeg player , avi player )
games ( tetris , reversi , lego mindstorms interface , etc. )
collaboration tools ( email client , chat , shared whiteboard , etc. )
servers ( web server , content addressable storage system , etc. )
tools ( vt terminal , telnet , sgml editor , debuggers , etc. )

A teenager has become the first transplant patient to switch blood groups - at estimated odds of six billion to one .
Demi-Lee Brennan had O - negative blood before receiving a replacement liver six years ago .
However , she is now O - positive after her body adopted the immune system of the organ 's donor .
Scroll down for more ...
The switch means the 15 - year - old no longer needs immunosuppressant drugs which are used to stop the body rejecting a new organ .
The drugs are usually taken for life and only a small number of transplant patients have been able to come off them .
None is thought to have done so by jumping blood groups .
Experts say that studying what happened to the Australian teenager may open the way to beating organ rejection - the holy grail of transplant medicine .
Richard Thompson , a paediatric hepatology expert at King 's College London , said Demi - Lee 's case appeared to be unique .
He said : " It 's a dramatic , remarkable case and she 's been incredibly lucky .
" A small number of people can stop taking anti-rejection drugs altogether after a transplant because they develop a tolerance to the donor organ but this has not been achieved before by a change in blood group .
Scroll down for more ...
" It can be extremely dangerous to take patients off immunosupressants to see what happens .
" It can result in rejection and the patient then needs a new organ . "
Doctors try to give patients organs from donors of the same blood group .
But Demi -Lee was so ill that medics took a chance when a mismatched liver became available at Westmead Childrens ' Hospital in Sydney .
Ten months later she developed lifethreatening anaemia .
Tests showed stem cells from the donor were taking over her bone marrow , the site where blood cells are produced .
In desperation , doctors withdrew Demi-Lee 's anti-rejection therapy - allowing the donor cells to overwhelm her own .
It worked and within a few
months her blood type had switched completely to that of the donor .
Four years on she remains healthy - as does her liver .
" It 's like my second chance at life , " she says .
" It 's kind of hard to believe . "
Doctors who treated Demi - Lee say they cannot fully explain her recovery , which is detailed in the latest edition of The New England Journal of Medicine .
Michael Stormon , a paediatric hepatologist at Westmead , said : " There was no precedent for this having happened at any other time , so we were sort of flying by the seat of our pants . "
Stuart Dorney , the hospital 's former transplant unit chief , said : " We now need to go back over everything that happened to Demi - Lee and see why , and if it can be replicated .
We think because we used a young person 's liver and Demi - Lee had low white blood cells , that could have been a reason . "
Meanwhile , U.S. scientists are pioneering a way of re-engineering the immune system in transplant patients to accept mismatched organs without the need for anti-rejection therapy .
They are using bone marrow taken from the donors at the same time as the organ to persuade the body to accept foreign material as its own .
Dr Thompson said the results from the trial of kidney and liver transplant patients offered hope because six had remained healthy for up to five years without anti-rejection drugs .
" The ideal is to reprogramme the recipient 's own bone marrow to accept a mismatched donor organ but we 're a long way off achieving it , " he said .

“ Nine , eight , seven … ”
A crowd of about 10,000 people collectively began counting down on the University of Colorado ’s Norlin Quadrangle just before 4:20 p.m. Sunday .
Yet the massive puff of pot smoke that hovers over CU ’s Boulder campus every April 20 — the date of an annual , internationally recognized celebration of marijuana — began rising over the sea of heads earlier than normal this year .
“ Oh forget it , ” one student said , aborting the countdown to 4:20 p.m. and lighting his pipe early .
He closed his eyes , taking a deep , long drag .
“ Sweet . ”
Although it ’s become an annual and renowned event at CU , this year ’s 4/20 celebration was different in some ways than in many previous years :
The crowd was so large it migrated from the long - traditional site of Farrand Field to the larger Norlin Quad ; festivities kicked off earlier than normal with daytime concerts ; and CU police handed out zero citations .

TPM´s Great List of Scandalized Administration Officials
Boy , was it time for an update .
Late last year we decided to take stock of all the Bush Administration officials who ’d been accused of corruption and / or resigned in the face of scandal .
Although we had fun doing it , we altruistically started the project in order to help our friends at Powerline , who professed an inability to think of any Bush officials beset by scandal .
Indicted / Convicted / Pled Guilty
This year´s result , which built on Justin Rood´s original gem , is , like our catalog of the administration´s efforts to disappear information , a staggering monument to the Bush Administration .
And it would n’t have been possible without TPM ’s research hounds , Adrianne Jeffries , Andrew Berger , and Peter Sheehy .
A quick note on methodology .
Since a complete catalog of administration officials who ’ve been accused of some form of corruption or abuse of power would be endless , we tried to maintain a high standard for inclusion .
Most of those below were the subjects of criminal probes , but we also included officials who were credibly accused of acts that , if not criminal , were a corruption of office ( like the U.S. attorney scandal ) .
And even then , such officials were only included if their accusers had them dead to rights ( which is why Karl Rove did n’t make the cut ) .
We also limited ourselves to officials who were either political appointees or whose actions were so political that they were effectively political appointees ( like John Tanner ) .
Enjoy : – deputy undersecretary in charge of newly created Office of Safe and Drug - Free Schools ( previously senior adviser to Secretary of Education Rod Paige ) – pleaded guilty to one count of conflict of interest for using government travel for personal causes and was sentenced to one year of probation , 100 hours of community service , and fined $ 5,000 .

On November 17th , 2006 Brian Doyle was sentenced to five years in state prison and ten years of probation .
He will also need to register as a sex offender .
* Steven Griles – Deputy Secretary at the Interior Department – is the highest - ranked administration official yet convicted in the Jack Abramoff scandal .

* John Tanner – Voting Rights Section Chief , Justice Department – resigned in December of 2007 and moved to the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration - Related Unfair Employment Practices .

Under Investigation But Still in Office
* Stuart Bowen – Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction ( SIGIR ) – was once admired for his successes while investigating allegations of waste and fraud in Iraq , but now employee allegations have prompted four government investigations into the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction ( SIGIR ) .
* Lurita Doan – Administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration – still in office , despite investigations by both the Office of Special Counsel and the House oversight committee that found that Doan had “ crossed the line ” by suggesting that the GSA use its resources to help Republicans get elected .
* Alfonso Jackson – Secretary of Housing and Urban Development – following reports that Jackson told a business group in April 2006 that he once canceled a contract after the contractor criticized President Bush , an investigation by the HUD inspector general found that while Jackson told his deputies to favor Bush supporters , there was “ no direct proof that a contract was actually awarded or rescinded because of political affiliation . ”
A second , criminal investigation was triggered in part by Jackson ’s claim before Congress in May 2007 that “ I do n’t touch contracts . ”
That probe , now before a federal grand jury , has turned up evidence that Jackson may indeed have touched contracts – and steered them towards friends .

The latest literacy drive by ministers was ridiculed last night after it emerged public libraries are disappearing at the rate of almost one a week .
As Schools Secretary Ed Balls told parents to make reading with their children a New Year 's resolution , official figures revealed a loss of 40 libraries in just a year .
Campaigners also complained about reductions in opening hours , staff cuts and book shortages .
Libraries minister Margaret Hodge was forced to admit in a Commons written answer that while 31 libraries had opened in 2006 / 07 , 71 had closed , giving a net loss of 40 libraries .
Protestors are blaming Government pressure on local councils to make budget cuts .
There are also concerns that cash is being spent on DVDs , internet access and coffee shops at the expense of books , diverting the library service from its core function .
Cutbacks include proposals in Dudley , West Midlands , to shut five libraries .
Mrs Hodge stepped in to ensure the needs of the local communities were being met but failed to block the plans .
In Kent , 77 library staff have received letters warning they are at risk of redundancy while campaigners recently gathered in Southampton to protest against plans to cut opening hours at five libraries by an average of nine and a half hours a week .
Meanwhile libraries ' total lending stock is declining .
Between 2001 and 2005 , the number of books available for loan dropped from 67,8278,912 to 62,614,052 .
Officials at the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals said library staff numbers had dropped three per cent over the past decade .
Guy Daines , director of policy , added : " There 's been an under - investment generally in public libraries .
Not enough is spent on all types of resources including books .
" Not enough is spent on the buildings .
There 's a great deal to do in bringing the library estate up to standard . "
Andrew Coborn , secretary of the Library Campaign , said : " Forty closures is not good and there have been more proposed since then . "
The trend for libraries to close is understood to have begun prior to 2006 .
The loss of 40 in a year follows a previously - established pattern .
It emerged as Mr Balls declared that he wanted 2008 to be " the year of the book " and urged parents to make reading stories to their children as much a part of everyday routines as brushing teeth and having a bath .
The initiative is a desperate bid to reverse England 's poor showing in international league tables of reading standards .
In just five years , our primary schools dropped from third to 19th in a table of 10 - year - olds ' reading skills and children spend less time reading for pleasure than previously .
Meanwhile an independent inquiry into primary education found that reading standards have barely improved since the 1950s .
Launching the reading initiative , Mr Balls said : " This year I 'd like to encourage people to add a slightly different resolution to the list - one that will hopefully have a long - term impact on their lives and that of their children .
" If you can find five or 10 minutes to read with your child every night before bedtime it can make all the difference . "
But critics said the campaign was blatantly undermined by library closures .
Shadow Schools Secretary Michael
Gove said : " It is beyond ironic that when Ed Balls is calling for more children to read his government has presided over the closure of the libraries which disadvantaged families rely on for books .
" That 's the problem with this Government - bluster , rhetoric and big claims but on the ground a failure to deliver . "
In 2006 , it emerged libraries were allocated £ 80 million in National Lottery funding but could not spend any on books .
Instead , the money had to be pay for library buildings to be adapted to include services such as creches , mother and toddler groups , tai chi classes and adult education courses .
In her written answer , Mrs Hodge said : " Library reorganisations can result in better and wider access - for example to take account of where population shifts from one area to another , or where two small , part - time libraries are closed and strategically replaced with a larger new library open for longer hours . "
A spokesman for the Department of Culture , Media and Sport said : " Decisions about the public library service are best taken by local authorities who are accountable to the users of the service . "
Fed Chairman
Powell and his predecessors do not want you to read this book .
Ditto for easy money / low interest Trump .
Please order one for yourself and another for your best friend , or a colleague , or a neighbor , etc .
Ask them to do the same .
If the book has a high Amazon ranking , the sky ’s the limit as far as having a national discussion about the need for the Federal Reserve , given all the negative effects of its manipulation of interest rates .

A synopsis of my book that I wrote in May 1976 !
Death toll continues to rise as US military launches new offensive in Iraq
By James Cogan
10 January 2008
Six American soldiers were killed in Iraq on Wednesday during the US military ’s New Year offensive against anti-occupation insurgents in the province of Diyala , north of Baghdad .
The operation , codenamed Iron Harvest , is the fourth major assault in the area during the past six months and underscores the entrenched nature of the guerilla war against the US occupation and the US - backed Iraqi government .
The casualties were the heaviest daily loss suffered by US forces since September and take the American death toll in January to 17 .
Some 4,000 American troops , backed by Iraqi government forces , moved from different directions into an area of farming towns and hamlets along the Diyala River , nicknamed the Breadbasket , during the early hours of Tuesday morning .
The objective was to trap and kill an estimated 200 fighters alleged to be members of the Sunni fundamentalist organisation Al Qaeda in Iraq .
The soldiers were killed when a massive explosion detonated while they searched a booby - trapped house .
Four others were wounded .
Embedded New York
Times journalists reported that US troops have “ encountered numerous improvised roadside bombs and booby traps , barely detectable except for telltale filaments of copper wire glinting in the morning sun through the undergrowth and orange trees ” .
The US military reported that at least three armoured vehicles have been struck by roadside bombs , wounding three soldiers .
Occupation spokesmen claim that Sunni extremists driven out of the western province of Anbar and the suburbs of Baghdad have relocated north to Diyala and the neighbouring province of Salahaddin , as well as further north to areas surrounding the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul .
American and Iraqi government forces in these locations have come under increased attack .
The US military has reported that of the 4,749 incidents in December , 2,014 took place in the north - central provinces compared with just 808 in Anbar — the province where the most intense fighting took place during the first four years of the occupation .
The US commander in northern Iraq , Major General Mark Hertling , told journalists that Raider Harvest was “ a massive operation to really squeeze in the Breadbasket what we think is a major Al Qaeda logistics site and to a lesser degree command and control operations .
The intent of this operation is to hit them hard here , make them defend and at the same time stop them from flowing to other places . ”
As the operation unfolds , however , US commanders are again expressing frustration that the majority of the Iraqi insurgents have either fled the area in advance or been able to blend into the local population .
Before US troops launched an assault on Diyala ’s capital Baqubah last June , an estimated 500 fighters left the city .
Last September , insurgents abandoned the town of Muqdadiya in the face of a US assault , leaving American forces to navigate through booby - trapped streets and houses and confront ongoing guerilla attacks .
Despite some 24,000 US troops being positioned in northern Iraq , along with 50,000 government troops and an increasing number of so - called citizens groups — or US - paid militias — the Iraqi guerillas appear to have had little difficulty eluding the latest operation .
According to Hertling , only “ 20 to 30 ” insurgents were killed in the first 24 hours of the carefully planned trap .
In the lead - up , considerable efforts were made to prevent the insurgents receiving advance knowledge of the attack .
US forces made it appear they were building up their forces for an offensive on villages south of Baqubah .
Most significantly , however , Iraqi military commanders whose units were slated to take part in the operation were deliberately given false information about the target .
A US officer , Major Eddie Sedlock , told the Washington Post : “ We did n’t tell them about it until the day , knowing they were probably infiltrated by Al Qaeda . ”
Just as in Afghanistan , where the term “ Taliban ” is being applied to any Afghan resisting US occupation , in Iraq insurgents are simply branded Al Qaeda .
The reality is that the majority of Iraqis , including in the Iraqi Army , are hostile to the US presence .
While they oppose the political perspective of Islamic extremists and the killing of civilians , millions of Iraqis sympathise with attacks on American and other foreign troops .
After close to five years of indiscriminate US bombings and killings , they particularly identify with the communities that are the target of US operations .
While a US officer blamed the “ increase in helicopter traffic overhead ” for alerting the guerillas to the US intentions , there is little doubt that American commanders suspect that tip - offs were passed on from the highest levels within the Iraqi government and military .
According to the New York Times , US units noticed “ an unusual number of women and children fleeing south in cars in recent days ” .
As in all previous colonial wars , the US military confronts a population that will take every opportunity to hinder , sabotage and strike back against the occupation of the country .
Troops , for example , encounter great difficulty in getting help to locate explosive devices and booby traps .
The inevitable consequence is that terrified American soldiers begin to regard all Iraqis as their enemies , with the inevitable result being atrocities against civilians .
Washington
Post journalist Amit Paley matter - of - factly reported on January 9 what appears to be the callous shooting and detention of an innocent Iraqi .
The new offensive , he wrote , “ is showing how difficult it is to determine whether someone is an insurgent .
One of the Iraqis wounded and then detained on Tuesday was shot because US soldiers said he refused to listen to their commands .
‘ He just did the wrong thing at the wrong time ’ , one soldier told Coffey [ the unit commander ] over his radio .
‘ But I do n’t know if we can call him a detainee .
I do n’t think he has anything incriminating against him ’ . ”
There is no indication in the article as to whether an investigation resulted .
The incident , which has been reproduced countless times in one form or another , simply adds one more to the toll of death and injury inflicted on the Iraqi people by US imperialism in the course of its criminal occupation .
With the US presidential race well underway , no effort is being spared to promote the Bush administration ’s claim that its “ surge ” of additional troops last year is bringing the Iraq war to an end .
For 24 million Iraqis and 160,000 American soldiers , the reality is very different .
The lives of 17 Americans and over 200 Iraqis have already been squandered this year to feed US ambitions to control the country ’s oil resources and territory .
The gold standard / A precious metal that 's not just an investment but a worldview too

The gold standard / A precious metal that 's not just an investment but a worldview too 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Last week , gold hit a record high of $ 958.40 an ounce .
In 1959 , the average price of gold was around $ 35 an ounce .
That 's the year Burton Blumert opened his Camino Coin Company in Burlingame .
To the outside observer , it would appear that the rise of gold is a success story for long - time dealers and investors like Blumert and his clients .
And in many respects it is .
As Blumert told me on the phone from his home in El Granada , " I retired at the top of my game . "
( After giving the Camino Coin Company to a long - time employee last year , Blumert , 79 , stays peripherally involved , helping out occasionally when needed ) .
But there is , so to speak , another side to the coin .
" If you want a dismal view of the future , talk to a gold dealer , " Blumert adds .
The high price of gold may represent a handsome return on investment , but it 's hardly been a steady ascent , and for Blumert and other " goldbugs " it 's also an ominous sign .
Goldbug is a term used , sometimes pejoratively , to refer to investors who are bullish about gold .
Blumert describes himself as a " philosophical goldbug " to emphasize the theoretical underpinnings of his interest in the malleable yellow metal ( and to distinguish himself from the more capricious " newsletter crowd " of investors , who might jump on the gold bandwagon following trends rather than principles ) .
The story of how Blumert became a philosophical goldbug is the story of a worldview shaped by coins and bullion .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
It starts with a whirlwind verbal tour of watershed dates in " the significant monetary history that coincided " with his life and crystallized his philosophy of money .
He jumps from decade to decade , adducing examples with a zeal that somehow sounds both beleaguered and self - assured :
There was 1933 , when President Roosevelt passed an executive order making it " illegal for Americans to hold gold coins " ; 1964 , when the United States stopped producing real silver coins ; and 1971 , when Nixon ended the gold standard for good .
( " From that point we were dealing with fiat money , " says Blumert , " money that is not claimable in precious metals . " )
The history of American currency 's relationship to the gold standard is long and tortuous ( you can read an overview here ) but what I come away with after listening to Blumert 's history lesson is more a sense of how the government 's interventions in monetary policy became almost personally offensive to him .
He talks about 40 - year - old moments in the history of currency in the same way that some people talk about a bad breakup they 're still trying to work through .
( " August 16 , 1968 .
That was when it was all over .
If you had a silver certificate , you had to redeem it prior to August 16 . " )
All of the dates Blumert brings up are occasions when the federal government took actions to divorce currency from its precious - metal backing .
And for the philosophical goldbug , a currency with nothing behind it is a recipe for disaster — when the government can print money and the Fed can adjust credit rates , the system , in the goldbug 's view , is headed for collapse .
Blumert says his experiences with money led him to a natural political stance .
" I became a libertarian , " he says , " an advocate of freedom . "
Blumert is publisher of the libertarian Web site Lew Rockwell.com , whose motto is " anti-state , anti-war , pro-market . "
He is also a longtime friend and supporter of Ron Paul , and managed the Ron Paul Coin Company for several years .
Paul , not coincidentally , is an advocate of returning to the gold standard and abolishing the Fed .
" There are those who would criticize followers of Ron Paul as people out of the mainstream , " says Blumert .
But Blumert is used to being regarded as part of the fringe .
" Those who own gold are regarded as wackos , " he says .
" If you buy an ounce of gold , you 're saying no ( to the system ) .
If you buy a share of Microsoft , you 're a patriot — you 're participating , you 're part of it . "
" That was the prevailing view " for most of his tenure in the gold and coin business , Blumert says .
" And it still is , although to a lesser extent . "
The reputation of the goldbug as an outsider — and as a stubborn fanatic — prevails in a 2000 New Yorker magazine article in which author James Collins wrote that nearly any investment purchased in 1980 " would have increased in value by the year 2000 ...
There was , however , one investment that would have lost you money , causing not only financial distress but also shame and humiliation .
That investment was gold . "
In 1980 , Collins went on to explain , the price of gold peaked at $ 825.50 an ounce ; in 2000 , the price was about $ 280 an ounce .
" So , " the author continued , " while the popular crowd has rocked on at the bull - market beach party , gold investors have been holed up in somebody 's basement , with two beers among them , and no girls . "
Blumert recalls , " It was a horrible time in our industry from 1980 through 2000 .
We were in a depression . "
When Collins ' article came out , Blumert wrote a response on LewRockwell.com , calling the piece " scurrilous " and another example of the establishment marginalizing the gold investor .
" I was very sensitive to these people who attacked our industry , " Blumert says in retrospect .
But something funny happened after that New Yorker article appeared :
In 2001 , gold prices went up .
And they have n't declined since .
According to Platts , a provider of energy and metals information , " The gold market is now enjoying its longest rally since the metal began trading openly on an exchange in 1974 . "
Which brings us to the goldbug 's paradox .
Precious - metal prices tend to increase in times of economic uncertainty and a weakened U.S. dollar .
And this inverse relationship is key to understanding Blumert 's reference to gold dealers ' dismal view of the future .
To a philosophical goldbug , when the price of their commodity increases , it 's a sign that the global economy is tanking .
Inflation is proof that the fiat money system is an illusion — and an affirmation that , in the portentous , Arthurian terms of a recent book by Nathan Lewis , gold is The Once and Future Money .
But — and here 's the paradox — for the goldbug 's worldview to be finally vindicated , the fiat money system has to collapse .
" Many of my clients would like to be standing in the rubble of our society saying , ' I told you so , ' " Blumert says .
" And there was a time when I did want collapse — when I was young and excited about my view .
But the older I get , personally I can't deal with rubble anymore .
I do n't want to see a collapse , to be vindicated and say , ' See , I was right . ' "
Instead , Blumert is enjoying his semi-retirement ( " I 'm looking out at the Pacific , " he said when I phoned him on a weekday afternoon ) and remembering the pleasures of his long career in the gold business .
He says he 's proud that the Camino Coin Company developed a reputation for professionalism and integrity : " How could we not deal in integrity , when that 's what the commodity was founded on ? "
As he watches gold prices climb , Blumert sees further evidence of the weakness of a paper money system that , in his view , lacks the integrity of a precious metal .
And as he expounds on his philosophy in an emphatic and excited baritone , the goldbug 's paradox is contained in his genial voice — it expresses apprehension but also confidence at the same time .
More baseless paper dollars may be required to buy an ounce of gold today compared with 50 years ago , says Blumert , but " the gold does n't change .
The gold is constant . "

Rob Baedeker is a writer living in Berkeley .
He is the co-author , with the Kasper Hauser comedy group , of " SkyMaul , " the catalog parody .
Oliver Willis noted , " Bush surrounds himself with this echo chamber in order to hear good things about himself , and not hear a single critical word about his failed presidency . "
We 've seen plenty of examples of this , but yesterday was a stark reminder .
From Hugh Hewitt :
It 's quite a motley crew , is n't it ?
And Democratic presidential candidates are supposed to avoid Yearly Kos ?
While Bush is inviting these far - right voices into the White House for a chat ?
Hillary Clinton ’s campaign is signaling that a second Clinton presidency will follow the look - to - the - future , do n’t - worry - about - accountability approach toward Republican wrongdoing that marked Bill Clinton ’s years in office .
That was the significance of former President Clinton ’s remarkable Dec. 17 comment that his wife ’s first act in the White House would be to send Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush on an around - the - world mission to repair America ’s damaged image .
“ The first thing she intends to do is to send me and former President Bush and a number of other people around the world to tell them that America is open for business and cooperation again , ” said Bill Clinton , who has accompanied the senior Bush on international humanitarian missions over the past several years .
What was perhaps most stunning about the remark was its assumption that Americans would be impressed that the country ’s two dominant political dynasties would team up in early 2009 to tidy up some of the mess created by the headstrong son of the senior dynasty , the Bush Family .
The Bushes and the Clintons – who have held pieces of the nation ’s executive power for more than a quarter century dating back to George H.W. Bush ’s election as Vice President in 1980 – essentially would be keeping matters within the board rooms of the Washington Establishment .
In responding to Bill Clinton ’s remark , George H.W.
Bush issued a statement making clear he would not join in any slap at his son ’s foreign policy .
That also means Hillary Clinton ’s “ first thing ” is unthinkable if her new administration were trying to exact any accountability from George W. Bush for his wrongdoing .
So , to get the senior Bush ’s cooperation on the worldwide tour , there would have to be an implicit understanding that the second Clinton administration would n’t investigate the younger Bush ’s crimes – from authorizing torture , ordering warrantless wiretaps , exposing CIA officer Valerie Plame ’s identity , waging war under false pretenses and other abuses of executive powers .
If Hillary Clinton does get elected , you can expect to hear lots of talk about “ leaving that one for the historians ” or about the danger of increased partisanship if the Democrats were viewed as trying to “ get even ” by exposing Bush ’s offenses .
The wise heads of Washington surely would nod in approval at this “ bipartisanship ” of a Democratic administration deciding not to get bogged down in “ refighting the battles ” of the second Bush administration .
The First Clinton - Bush Deal
That ’s exactly what happened in 1993 when Bill Clinton entered the White House after defeating George H.W. Bush .
Clinton and other senior Democrats shut down or wrapped up four investigations that implicated senior Republicans , including Bush , in constitutional abuses of power and criminal wrongdoing during the Reagan - Bush years .
The Iran -Contra arms - for - hostages case was still alive , with special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh furious over new evidence that President George H.W.
Bush may have obstructed justice by withholding his own notes from investigators and then ducking an interview that Walsh had put off until after the 1992 elections .
Bush also had sabotaged the investigation by pardoning six Iran - Contra defendants on Christmas Eve 1992 , possibly the first presidential pardon ever issued to protect the same President from criminal liability .
In late 1992 , Congress also was investigating Bush ’s alleged role in secretly aiding Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein during and after Hussein ’s eight - year - long war with Iran .
Representative Henry Gonzalez , a Democrat from Texas who had served three decades in Congress , had exposed intricate financial schemes that the Reagan - Bush administrations employed to assist Hussein .
There also were allegations of indirect U.S. military aid through third countries , including the supply of dangerous chemicals to Iraq .
Lesser known investigations were examining two other sets of alleged wrongdoing : the so - called October Surprise issue ( allegations that Bush and other Republicans interfered with Jimmy Carter ’s hostage negotiations with Iran during the 1980 campaign ) and the Passportgate affair ( evidence that Bush operatives improperly searched Clinton ’s passport file in 1992 , looking for dirt that could be used to discredit his patriotism and secure reelection for Bush ) .
All told , the four sets of allegations , if true , would paint an unflattering portrait of the 12 - year Republican rule , with two illegal dirty tricks ( October Surprise and Passportgate ) book - ending ill - considered national security schemes in the Middle East ( Iran - Contra and Iraqgate ) .
Had the full stories been told , the American people might have perceived the legacies of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush quite differently .
But the Clinton administration and congressional Democrats dropped all four investigations beginning in early 1993 , either through benign neglect – by failing to hold hearings and keeping the issues alive in the news media – or by actively closing the door on investigative leads .
Clinton let George H.W. Bush retreat gracefully into retirement .
[ For details on the scandals , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
Joining the Cover-ups
In his 2004 memoir , My Life , Clinton wrote that he “ disagreed with the [ Iran - Contra ] pardons and could have made more of them but did n’t . ”
Clinton cited several reasons for giving his predecessor a pass .
“ I wanted the country to be more united , not more divided , even if that split would be to my political advantage , ” Clinton wrote .
“ Finally , President Bush had given decades of service to our country , and I thought we should allow him to retire in peace , leaving the matter between him and his conscience . ”
By his choice of words , Clinton revealed how he saw information – not something that belonged to the American people and had intrinsic value to the democratic process – but as a potential weapon that could be put to “ political advantage . ”
On the Iran - Contra pardons , Clinton saw himself as generously passing up a club that he could have wielded to bludgeon an adversary .
He chose instead to join in a cover - up in the name of national unity .
Similarly , the Democratic congressional leadership ignored the flood of incriminating evidence pouring in to the “ October Surprise ” task force in December 1992 .
Chief counsel Lawrence Barcella told me later that he urged task force chairman Lee Hamilton to extend the investigation several months to examine this new evidence of Republican guilt , but Hamilton ordered Barcella simply to wrap up the probe with a finding that the 1980 Reagan - Bush campaign had done nothing wrong .
Some of the new incriminating evidence – including an unprecedented report from the Russian government about its knowledge of illicit Republican contacts with Iran – was simply hidden away in boxes that I discovered two years later and dubbed “ The October Surprise X - Files . ”
The “ Iraqgate ” investigation met a similar fate under Clinton ’s Justice Department , which chose to ignore or dismiss evidence of covert shipments of war materiel to Saddam Hussein during the 1980s .
In 1996 , when former Reagan national security official Howard Teicher came forward with an affidavit describing secret U.S. - backed arms shipments to Iraq , Clinton ’s Justice Department went on the offensive – against Teicher , trying to discredit him and bullying him into silence .
That same year , the Clinton administration did nothing when Reagan ’s 1984 campaign chief Ed Rollins wrote in his 1996 memoir Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms that a top Filipino politician had admitted delivering an illegal $ 10 million cash payment to Reagan from Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos .
" I was the guy who gave the ten million from Marcos to your campaign , " the Filipino told Rollins in 1991 , according to the memoir .
" I was the guy who made the arrangements and delivered the cash personally .
... It was a personal gift from Marcos to Reagan . "
The stunning anecdote did attract some press coverage in 1996 but the story died because the Clinton administration made no effort to follow it up .
No government investigator demanded that Rollins reveal the identities of the Filipino politician and the Republican lobbyist who handled the pay - off .
( Rollins is now chairman of Republican Mike Huckabee ’s presidential campaign . )
[ For details on Marcos - Reagan case , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Huckabee ’s Chairman Hid Payoff Secret . ” ]
Proving Themselves
In the mid-1990s , even as the Republican attack machine pounded the Clintons with allegations about alleged ethical lapses and marital infidelities , the Clinton administration acted like it was determined to prove that it could be trusted with the nation ’s dark secrets , that it could cover up wrongdoing with the best of them .
The consequence for America , however , was different .
With George H.W. Bush ’s dubious public record whitewashed , the door was opened to the restoration of the Bush Dynasty .
If the full truth had been known about former President Bush , it ’s hard to conceive how George W. Bush ever could have become President .
Now , as Hillary Clinton seeks a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses to solidify her image as the inevitable Democratic nominee , she appears ready to pick up the mantle as the Democratic protector of the Bush Family ’s legacy .
Though she may utter some tough words about George W. Bush on the campaign trail , she ’s not likely to follow up if she wins the White House .
If Bill Clinton is telling the truth about Hillary Clinton ’s “ first thing ” to do as President – recruiting George H.W. Bush for a worldwide goodwill tour on behalf of America ’s image – that will require closing the door on any serious investigation of George W. Bush .
The two dynastic families then can look to the future , again .

There is no irony in appeasement , according to major media who , on February 20 and 21 , reported on a press conference held in Brussels by the National Council of Resistance of Iran .
From an Associated Press account :
An exiled Iranian opposition group claimed Wednesday that Tehran was speeding up a program to develop nuclear weapons .
" The Iran regime entered a new phase in its nuclear project , " said Mohammad Mohaddessin of the Paris - based National Council of Resistance of Iran .
The NCRI is the political wing of the People ’s Mujahedeen of Iran , which advocates the overthrow of government in Tehran .
The Mujahedeen has been designated a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union as well as Iran . [ 1 ]
The PMOI — a.k.a. , the Mujahedeen e-Khalq ( MeK ) — made the same claim in December 2002 .
The allegation then — that the Iranian regime was enriching uranium at weapons - grade level within secret facilities — turned out to be only partially ( and irrelevantly ) true : the facilities existed ( not a violation in itself ) , but contrary to the group 's claims , were not weapons - production sites .
Still , the information from the MeK — contrived in conjunction with Israeli entities — was used by U.S. hawks to pass sanctions against Iran .
But their case has been so weak ; the neocons have had to use blatant coercion to persuade UNSC nations to vote in favor .
The most notable and dangerous in all this is that the unproven MeK - Israeli , nuclear weapons claim is the basis for the main finding of the most recent National Intelligence Estimate : that Iran had " halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 . "
Iran never had a weapons program — at least not one that has been confirmed by U.S. intelligence , the IAEA , or anyone else but Iranian " dissidents " and Israelis and neocons , i.e. , the ones who have been wrong all along .
Further deconstruction of the Iranian nukes fraud and the neocons ' nuclear shakedown of Iran :
Iran was late in reporting which is a Safeguard issue .
. . .
Tehran voluntarily stopped the process of enriched uranium ; it also allowed the IAEA to carry out intrusive , spot inspections .
No country has allowed as many inspection hours as Iran .
[ Tehran ] proposed to operate Iran ’s enrichment program as joint ventures with private and public sector firms from other countries ; this would ensure that the program remained transparent and could not be secretly diverted for military purposes , at the same time it would maintain Iran ’s sovereignty by having an indigenously enriched uranium cycle . . .
Although this was rejected , Iran continued to cooperate .
Iran suspended its enrichment activities for two and half years , but each time under pressure from the U.S. , the burden of proof was transferred to Iran knowing the negative could not be proved . [ 2 ]
' Coverage '
All this occurs , when in fact no evidence has ever been verified that supports the weapons charge , as AP surprisingly points out ( albeit in the last two sentences of the story and about a year late on the timeline ) .
What media always fail to mention , however , is that the lack of damning proof of an Iranian weapons program , then and now , undercuts the misleading NIE conclusion and the nuclear leg of the neocons ’ aggressive campaign .
But by omitting such vital facts , major media are perpetuating the prevailing U.S. - Israeli-NCRI conjecture , asserting that Tehran had a viable nuclear weapons program at one time , has resumed it , and is now accelerating the manufacturing process .
In that regard , news media are lying and abetting terrorism and treason .
Terrorism , because all individuals who harbor , fund , arm , train , feed , or employ terrorists are terrorists ( George Bush ’s words — not mine ) .
Treason , because the Mek and their handlers in and around the U.S. government are violating U.S. and international law and constantly lying to the people of the United States and the world in an effort to drum up support for further violent insurrection and aggressive war in the Middle East .
Nothing dubious here
Major news media conceal the U.S. government ’s dubious relations with the MeK .
It is of no consequence that the United States has been harboring , funding , training , and employing U.S. - designated terrorist groups in Iran and elsewhere in the Middle East . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Some news media provide extra " coverage " by inserting a misleading historical context in an effort to soften the image of the Iranian " opposition group . "
From the EU Observer ’s report on the NCRI press conference :
[ T ]he PMOI was persecuted by the Iranian government , with thousands of their members killed .
They were subsequently sheltered by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein . [ 6 ]
The insinuation that the " persecut[ion ] " was unprovoked is absurd .
Prosecuted is more like it , according to the U.S. State Department :
According to a 2003 report by the State Department , " During the 1970s , the MEK killed US military personnel and US civilians working on defense projects in Tehran . …
The MEK detonated bombs in the head office of the Islamic Republic Party and the Premier ’s office , killing some 70 high - ranking Iranian officials . …
In 1991 , it assisted the Government of Iraq in suppressing the Shia and Kurdish uprisings in southern Iraq and the Kurdish uprisings in the north . "
In other words , the MEK was a terrorist group — one that took its orders from Saddam Hussein . [ 7 ]
But to " mainstream " news media , it does n’t matter that the same Iranian opposition group with a history of committing terrorism on U.S. and Iranian civilians is relied upon as the means to justify and accomplish the neocons and the Mek ’s mutual ends of regime - change and resource procurement in Iran .
Alireza Jafarzadeh , spokesman for the MeK , has appeared intermittently over the past few years as a " Middle East Expert , " or " Terror Expert , " on CNN and Fox .
Of course there ’s never a hint as to his affiliation with the MeK , much less its terrorist designation .
But hey , how can he be a terrorist when he heads his own D.C. - based think - tank !
Nothing illicit here
The most thoroughly unreported facts about U.S. - Iranian affairs are the most incriminating ones .
The Algiers Accords , signed by Iran and the United States on January 19 , 1981 , clearly states , " The United States pledges that it is and from now on will be the policy of the United States not to intervene , directly or indirectly , politically or militarily , in Iran ’s internal affairs . " [ 8 ( .pdf ) ]
Yet , from the Iraq - Iran War , during which the United States funded Saddam Hussein and supplied him with WMDs which he then used against Iran — to the current war build - up against Iran , whereby groups like the MeK and Jundallah are being harbored , funded , and employed — the laundry list of Algiers Accords violations by the United States is long and ugly .
And every violation is a violation of the U.S. Constitution , which states that such contracts are to be treated as law of the land .
Move along , folks
One of the most irony - deficient ( and shamelessly self - effacing ) examples of U.S. - Iran media coverage came in the Observer ’s uncritical account of the NCRI ’s use of fallacious war propaganda to emotionally blackmail and upbraid the EU into taking a more aggressive stance toward Iran :
Referring to the " huge trade " between Europe and Iran , Mr Mohaddessin said : " The EU is trying to achieve security through appeasing the Iranian regime .
The EU is appeasing the Iranian regime and it is a disaster for the Iranian people .
You remember what happened in the 1930s ?
They carried out exactly the same policy with Hitler that the EU is doing now with the Iranian regime . " [ 9 ]
This reality - inversion of a comparison is trumpeted almost exclusively by fringe pro-war elements within and around U.S. and Israeli governments and in " pro-western " think - tanks ; the other 99.7 % of the world laughs it off , knowing that the only Middle Eastern regime with a modern history of aggressive war and secret nuclear weapons production is the one in Israel .
In 1986 , former Israeli nuclear facility worker , Mordechai Vanunu , revealed to a foreign news news reporter that Israel was developing nuclear weapons in secret facilities — a confirmation of what the rest of the world had already hypothesized .
He was kidnapped by Mossad agents in Italy , charged with treason , and sentenced to 18 years in prison .
Unlike the MeK and others , he did n’t confide in or collaborate with a foreign government , and was n’t revealing information that was n’t already known outside of Israel .
Nevertheless , he has been a political prisoner for the last 21 years .
Even his 2004 release gave him little freedom : he is not allowed to leave the country and is under , among other restrictions , curfew and gag order , not allowed to talk to foreigners . [ 10 ]
Although Vanunu ’s claims about Israel ’s illicit nuclear weapons program were true and were made on moral and legal grounds — and the treatment he has received is unlawful and at times barbaric — his story is still ignored by mainstream media .
On the other hand , the NCRI - MeK is a U.S. - designated terror organization with a verified history of terrorism against Iranian and U.S. targets and treason against their people ; yet they are treated by the U.S. government and major news media as trustworthy allies , and their flawed , Israeli - assisted intelligence is considered more credible than that of any U.S. intelligence agency .
And to top it all :
By not giving in to U.S. - Israel - MeK demands for aggression toward Iran — the demands of U.S. and EU - branded terrorists — the EU is " appeasing the Iranian regime . "
Such is the criminal hypocrisy of deceptive and aggressive war , and the irony of appeasement .

In one of the more ludicrous distortions in the history of magazine publishing , The Reader ’s Digest ( RD ) in an article titled “ World ’s Most Dangerous Leaders ” by Dale Van Atta names three regional leaders as “ dangerous ” --- but leaves out global bruiser George Bush .
Yet pollsters repeatedly are being told by people the world over they regard Bush as more dangerous than any one but Osama bin Laden , and much more dangerous than RD ’s nominees -- Kim Jong-il of North Korea , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela .
One survey was made by the UK daily The Guardian with the Toronto Star and La Presse in Canada and Reforma in Mexico .
Guardian reporter Julian Glover wrote British voters see President Bush “ as a greater danger to world peace than either the North Korean leader , Kim Jong - il , or the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Both countries were once cited by ( Bush ) as part of an ‘ axis of evil ’ , but it is Mr. Bush who now alarms voters in countries with traditionally strong links to the U.S. ”
In Britain , 69 % of those questioned said U.S. policy has made the world less safe since 2001 .
And 62 % of Canadians and 57 % of Mexicans felt the same way .
In England , only bin Laden outranked Bush as “ a great or moderate danger to peace ” at 87 % , compared to Bush , at 75 % .
Brits said Bush tops North Korea ’s Jong - il , feared by 69 % , and Iran ’s Ahmadinejad , feared by a mere 62 % .
But RD ’s 10 - million U.S. subscribers did n’t read nary a critical word about Bush from Van Atta .
Another survey , by Ottawa - based EKOS Research , reported similar results , according to an Associated Press report of Nov. 3 , 2006 .
AP quotes Paul Adams , EKOS executive director , as saying his survey of the U.S. , Canada and Mexico , finds people saying : “ Whoa , this guy ( Bush ) is a danger to the world . ”
Adams added , “ These are allies and if the populations of their countries are saying George Bush is a threat to peace , that ’s a pretty damning statement about Bush ’s public diplomacy in the world . ”
And speaking of polls , 79 % of Iraqis surveyed opined recently the U.S. is having “ a negative influence on the situation in Iraq ” and 58 % percent said violence would decrease if the U.S. got out .
Too bad the one million Iraqis killed since Bush invaded were n’t asked their opinions before they were blown up on whether Bush is more dangerous than Hugo Chavez .
Of course , many of the two million Iraqis wounded since Bush started a war there to improve their lives might care to utter a few choice words about him .
Van Atta could visit Baghdad to make his own survey of who folks there regard as dangerous .
Like Fox News , you can count on RD to give readers a “ fair and balanced ” picture of events --- except some itty - bitty pieces might be missing .
In his indictment of Kim Jong - Il in his RD piece , published last July , Van Atta said Kim “ has turned North Korea into the third - largest exporter of opium . ”
But what country conquered by George Bush is in first place as global opium grower --- a country that in 2006 hit an historic high for excellence in poppy cultivation ?
According to the December 2 , 2006 , Washington Post , Afghanistan poppy acreage grew by 61 % that year and total production jumped 26 % , so that today it accounts for more than 90 % of the world ’s opium crop .
In days of old , when he was accused in the press of robbing banks , Jesse James would drop editors a note saying " I was n't there . "
By not including him on its " most wanted " list , RD is performing a similar press agentry service for Mr. Bush .
If you think this comparison is a bit unfair , remember the James Gang killed a grand total of 14 people .

You know what really cracks up Fox News host John Gibson ?
The untimely death of Heath Ledger !
The one thing John Gibson knows about Heath Ledger is that Heath Ledger kissed a boy in a gay movie for gay gays , and therefore , he was probably a total gay himself , in real life .
Therefore , his death is hilarious !
On his radio program the other day , the hero journalist mocked Ledger 's death something like half a dozen times , opening his show with a hilarious quip about Ledger quitting us and wondering if perhaps the actor killed himself after witnessing the poor performace of John Edwards in the last presidential debate .
It 's funny ' cause the authorities no longer suspect suicide !
Even the guests joined in , with funnyman Tom Sullivan calling him " Keith Bledger " and the lady cohost whose name we did n't catch wondering , mockingly , if Keith was perhaps a " deep thinker . "
Can you believe that wacky morning zoo crew went there ?
They 're saying what we 're not really thinking , because what the fuck ?
Listen and sputter !

Mr Bush warned world leaders of the dangers of climate change US President George W Bush infuriated his critics by professing world leadership on climate change at his meeting of the top 16 world economies - while offering no new substantive policy and implicitly rejecting binding emissions controls .
Mr Bush , who has been sceptical of climate change , said at the forum in Washington that our understanding of the science had moved on .
He agreed that energy security and climate change were major challenges and pledged to solve both problems - but dismissed notions of despair .
The American president said clean technologies like nuclear power and clean coal would protect the economy as well as the environment .
He said the US wanted to work with the United Nations towards a long - term goal on greenhouse gases .
Delegates upset
He also proposed a new global fund from the US , Japan and Europe to channel clean technology to developing countries .
This is a total charade ...
It 's a total humiliation
Visiting delegate
But some visiting delegates were outraged by what they said was a stream of spin running through the speech .
One ( who understandably asked not to be named ) said : " This is a total charade .
" The president has said he will lead on climate change but he wo n't agree binding emissions , while other nations will .
" He says he will lead on technology but then he asks other countries to contribute funds , without saying how much he 'll contribute himself .
" It 's humiliating for him - a total humiliation . "
Some delegates were particularly upset by the extravagant invitation by Mr Bush for other nations to follow the US lead in cutting emissions while increasing the economy .
Emissions did indeed buck the upward trend by dropping a fraction of 1 % in the US during 2006 - but even the American government admits this was due to a warm winter , cool summer and an oil price they considered far too high .
Moving on Significantly , some of the visiting delegates indicated they were already planning for Mr Bush 's departure from the White House .
The Germans said they had spent the past two days in productive meetings with US Democrats .
More diplomatically , the British said the issue of climate change stretched beyond any political cycle so it was natural to look ahead .
Certainly the Democrats are hoping to push an energy bill through the US Congress soon - maybe within the next few months .
Americans are more concerned about climate change than ever Mr Bush would then be forced to veto it to prevent it passing .
And this may not prove popular as opinion polls in the US suggest the American people are more concerned about climate change than ever before .
Delegates , though , are not dismissing the Washington meeting out of hand .
They say all talks on climate change bringing together the major economic powers are useful in some way - forging personal relationships and building trust .
A number of delegates said the Chinese were becoming less defensive with every international meeting on climate - and that will be vital if China is to be helped to deal with its booming emissions .
And some said it was useful - albeit tedious - to hear American officials lecturing them with the very facts of climate change that they had been ignoring for years .
The US has offered to continue this Washington process of discussions if it is deemed helpful by the United Nations .
Mr Bush himself says he is organising a summit of world leaders next summer .
Privately , some European delegates are already saying they hope their political leaders are not invited .

What are these ?
The hotel room was boring .
So Alex Goldberg did what he normally does when he ’s bored , which is often :
He sneaked out .
It was last year , and he was vacationing with his mom and sister at the Ritz - Carlton in Miami .
But Alex wanted to go where the action was .
He shuffled out of the lobby of the Ritz and cruised down Collins Avenue along the row of Art Deco hotels .
There was a party going on at the Delano .
Alex marched through the crowd in cargo shorts , belly out in a baggy T - shirt , sneaker laces dragging .
He found a spot on the edge of the pool and plunged his toes into the water .
“ What are you doing here ? ” asked a woman in a bathing suit .
“ Where are your parents ? ”
“ Taking a nap at the Ritz .
I just wanted to check this place out . ”
She did n’t believe him .
“ C’mon .
I know you .
I did a casting with you in New York . ”
Alex shook his head .
“ No , you did n’t . ”
“ I did too .
Your name is Josh something .
You ’re 11 .
What ’s the name of the movie you were in ? ”
“ I ’m not in any movie .
And I ’m 12 . ”
Alex borrowed a video camera from the woman ’s friend and disappeared into the crowd to interview people .
He found his first victim in the shallow end .
She was a blonde in a blue bikini , clumsily moving to the music .
“ Are you a professional dancer ? ” Alex asked sarcastically .
She looked curiously at the four - foot - nine - inch - tall boy .
“ Are you making a movie for school or something ? ” she asked .
“ Is this … educational ? ”
Alex was grinning .
Her friends started getting ideas .
“ Show him some ass , girl , ” said one .
Shake it a little .
And she did .
She turned around .
Jiggle jiggle jiggle .
Next up : Jamie Foxx .
The actor was near the bar , giving a woman a massage , and saw the crowd now gathered around Alex .
Foxx offered to buy him a drink .
What do you want , little boy ?
“ A piña colada , ” Alex said .
The crowd laughed , and he got one , virgin .
Alex ’s adventure ended hours later , at Nobu , where the pool crowd had migrated to feast on junket sushi .
He had been chatting up Venus and Serena Williams at a nearby table , and mugging for cameras with a cigar hanging from his lips while eating a bowl of ice cream .
Then the faces at his table went blank .
Alex looked up and saw what they saw .
His mother .
Busted .
If you catch him leaving school or going to basketball practice , Alex can seem like any other New York kid .
He has long shaggy hair and big round cheeks , and looks young for his age ( he turned 14 last month ) .
He ’s student - council president at his private school on the East Side .
According to his Facebook profile , he likes “ Golf , Tennis , Baseball , basketball , Soccer , Knicks , Waterskiing ” and musicians like Akon , “ Weird Al ” Yankovic , and Black Sabbath .
He likes to skateboard .
He likes cool clothes .
He talks a lot on his cell phone .
He worries about girls he likes and whether they like him back .
But Alex is n’t like other boys his age .
He ’s had free rein over the streets of Nolita since before he can remember , and he quickly learned the rules of that playground , turning his relationships with the neighborhood ’s shop owners into access to free gourmet meals and designer clothes and trendy sneakers , then turning those freebies into even better stuff ( like courtside Knicks tickets ) , and leveraging those perks into even more valuable things , like connections to athletes , rappers , nightclub owners , and so on .
On any given day after school , you can find him strutting down Elizabeth or Mulberry or Mott , past the foundations of his barter operation .
He ’s worked at Supreme , the clothing store and skate shop on Lafayette .
He ’s helped the chefs at Peasant .
On Sunday mornings , he likes to get to DiPalo ’s early , before the noon rush , and stretch the mozzarella with Louie , the cheese store ’s owner , and kibitz with Violanda , his 80 - year - old mother .
He helps out at Papabubble , a designer candy store that opened recently on Broome Street , and hawks peanuts at Vinny ’s Nut House on Mulberry and Grand .
“ He ’s like a man trapped in a baby ’s body — that ’s how I always describe him , ” says Vinny Peanuts .
After school for the last couple of years ,
Alex clocked in at his favorite job of all : at NikeID , the design - your - own - shoe mecca .
He scored this gig by accident .
He was hanging out on the sidewalk in Nolita , smoking a cigarette in big dramatic puffs , when a striking woman in her twenties passed by .
“ You know , ” said Vashtie Kola , “ you smoking a cigarette is not cool . ”
“ It ’s a fake , ” he said .
“ Do n’t worry , my babysitter is right over there . ”
Alex was 9 then .
Kola did n’t believe him .
She noticed Alex was clutching a green bottle .
“ Is that a Heineken ? ”
“ No .
It ’s a Pellegrino , duh . ”
Then she laughed , and Alex was in with her .
“ What comes out of his mouth just does n’t match what he looks like , ” she says .
“ It ’s as if he ’s been living on his own for years . ”
He took her to the store where he bought the gag cigarette , and she bought one , too .
They strolled up Elizabeth puffing on their fake butts .
Kola worked at NikeID at the time , and she introduced him to the sneakerheads there .
They can be an exclusive bunch , but Alex talked his way in .
“ He ’s a hustler , ” says Kola .
“ A natural - born hustler . ”
Before long , he was a part of the crew .
As in most of his jobs , he did n’t work for cash — child - labor laws would n’t allow it .
He worked for the connection , which was worth far more .
With steady access to NikeID , Alex turned himself into a valuable commodity , especially with the Knicks .
He started supplying players and officials in the front office with shoes — a gift for sneaking him into games .
He now sits courtside , and eats dinner in the green room with the players ’ families and friends .
“ It ’s like he assumes that he ’s supposed to be here , and so everyone else thinks he ’s supposed to be here , too , and it ’s like now he really is here , ” says Adia Revell , a former college player who knows him from the Garden .
Alex ’s favorite Knick is center Eddy Curry .
“ This is my little guy right here , my second assistant , ” Curry said about Alex at a recent game .
“ He tells me about my rebounding and positioning .
He ’s the funniest kid I ever met . ”
Nate Robinson , the team ’s dunk specialist , is also a fan .
He likes Alex ’s shoes .
“ I saw the sneakers he was wearing and said , ‘ Now , those are some sneakers I would want to see on my feet . ’ ”
For networking purposes ,
Alex always carries his own business cards .
He had 500 printed last year .
“ ALEX GOLDBERG , ” it reads .
“ CALL FOR KICKS , TICKETS AND CLOTHES . ”
The Goldbergs live on the top floor of a rent - stabilized building on Broome Street .
The loft is airy and neat , with tall ceilings and skylights .
Alex ’s father , Richard , gut - renovated the place himself when he first moved in , in the early seventies .
He now works as a wine consultant and has just uncorked a bottle of Côte du Rhône .
He pours a glass for Alex ’s mother , Robin , dressed in skinny jeans and a designer blouse , as they sit down to talk about their son .
Alex is “ a phenomenon , ” says Robin .
“ A self - made man . ”
She ’s constantly surprised by how many people he knows .
In California , a man recognized Alex from the salad line at Peasant .
In the Hamptons , people ask , “ Is that cool little kid your son ? ”
Her trainer at the gym knows Alex ; he bought shoes from him at NikeID .
Occasionally , she even thinks about asking his help to get into places .
“ It ’s cool , ” she says .
“ He ’s master of a universe that he ’s created for himself . ”
Richard credits Nolita for Alex ’s development .
“ Look around , ” he says .
“ Look at what and who Alex has at his disposal . ”
This is why Robin has worked to help keep the corporate intruders out of their neighborhood , at least as much as possible .
Peasant will show him how to cook a goose ; Starbucks wo n’t .
“ It ’s hard to imagine Alex growing up the way he has anywhere else , ” she says .
Robin worries , of course .
She worries about “ maintaining his childhood . ”
She worries that he ’ll develop an inflated ego .
And she worries that all the attention he receives for playing grown - up could lead to problems with other kids .
While Alex does have friends his own age , like Julian Schnabel ’s twin boys , Cy and Olmo , he can be a bit of a schoolyard bully .
And earlier this year , Alex was temporarily suspended from school for calling his teacher a “ dick ” under his breath .
His teacher need n’t have taken the comment personally .
Alex curses at everyone , even his parents .
“ Like , he ’ll be in the middle of the restaurant and say , ‘ Fuck you , Dad . ’
I mean , it ’s crazy , ” says Frank DeCarlo , the Peasant owner .
Richard and Robin try to discipline Alex about his language , but overall they ’re lenient .
In Miami , instead of grounding him for sneaking out , Robin let him hang out with the Delano crew all weekend .
( At one point , Alex found himself chatting up three topless women on the beach .
“ He was literally surrounded by six grade - A Miami titties , ” says Fernando Gil , a former “ Page Six ” reporter who met him there .
“ He was like a kid in a candy shop . ” )
The Goldbergs do n’t consider themselves a traditional family , and they ’re proud of Alex ’s precociousness and ingenuity .
Richard is impressed when he goes to Knicks games with Alex and watches his son chat up Jay - Z and Beyoncé .
He feels the same way when Alex calls from the golf course near his camp in Maine , asking him to send Cuban cigars by FedEx so he might bribe his counselors .
Richard was never like that as a kid .
He never had that uninhibited ability to create these kinds of opportunities .
“ All you really have to do is let him loose , ” he says .
This is about when Alex shuffles in .
“ C’mon , ” he says .
“ Let ’s go to my room . ”
Alex ’s room is an adolescent Shangri- la : Xbox , flat - screen TV , PlayStation , digital cable , a loft bed , guitar , bass , amp , goldfish , his own artwork , flags , Knicks ticket stubs , and his treasure : at least 60 pairs of Nike sneakers .
He sits in a butterfly chair , one leg slung over the edge , the untied laces of his shoes dangling loose like jungle vines .
His hair hangs so low over his eyes it ’s hard for him to see , so he fires off short pfffs of air , up and fast , to get it out of the way .
What , I ask , does he want to do when he gets older ?
“ I want to own Nike , ” he says .
Almost as soon as he ’s said it , he ’s bored again .
“ Let ’s get out of here , ” he says with a pfff .
“ I want a coffee . ”
It ’s almost ten .
He needs to get to bed .
Robin says no .
Alex does n’t do no .
Robin raises her voice .
“ Alex ! ”
“ Robin ! ”
She folds .
Alex is already at the elevator .
The street is the one place where Alex does not get bored .
He darts between the old Italian - meat - market crowd and the Chinese vendors hawking pashminas and the tourists puttering around what ’s left of Little Italy .
How , I ask Alex , has his neighborhood changed ?
“ I do n’t know , ” he says , cutting across the street .
“ I do n’t remember anything . ”
He keeps on moving , calling out to strangers we pass , never stopping for a response .
“ Hey , what ’s my fortune ? ” he asks a gypsy .
“ Hey , can I sit on your bike ? ” he asks a Hells Angels type .
When we make it to his coffee spot , Ferrara , on Grand , he orders a decaf cappuccino .
“ They make the best coffee here , ” he says .
“ The best . ”
Alex is something of a gourmand .
“ That ’s a good olive right there , ” he ’ll say .
Or : “ That ’s a good burger right there . ”
Or , as he dunked a hunk of bread into the garlicky wine broth pooled at the bottom of a bowl of linguine alle vongole one afternoon : “ That ’s the shit right there ! ”
The greatest insult is when , at a restaurant where he is not known , the maître d’ reaches for the kids ’ menu .
“ He ’s really advanced , as far as food goes , ” says DeCarlo .
In the Peasant kitchen , Alex is always asking questions .
Like : “ Where you ’d get that guinea fowl ? ”
Or : “ Those are nice razor clams , I saw them on the beach last week . ”
And : “ Oh , you ’re using pig ’s liver ; I had calf ’s liver last night . ”
He ’s not a bad cook , either .
Violanda , at DiPalo ’s , remembers one morning when she was making an omelette with asparagus and Romano cheese .
“ Why do n’t you use Parmesan ? ” Alex asked .
Violanda explained that she had learned the recipe from her mother , and that Romano is the cheese of Sicily , the region where they lived .
Parmesan is from the North .
But Alex thought the dish could be improved upon .
“ Parmesan is a little more delicate , ” he told her .
“ It would n’t take away from the asparagus . ”
Then he got an idea .
“ Viola , I ’m going to make you breakfast this morning , ” he said .
He came back an hour later with an asparagus omelette , just like she ’d made , only with Parmesan cheese .
“ I ’m telling you , that dish looked gorgeous , ” says Violanda , who now uses Parmesan in her omelettes .
“ I said , ‘ I ca n’t believe , Alex , you can do such a thing like this !’
So beautiful .
And he was so proud to do it for me .
I kissed him and said , ‘ You are something unbelievable . ’ ”
Over our cappuccinos , I ask Alex what he thinks the difference is between himself and his friends .
He takes a steamy sip , leaving a foamy cappuccino mustache behind .
“ I ’m more mature , ” he says .
“ Is n’t this coffee the best ? ”
Then he ’s out the door and heading up the street to a Chinese shop .
He pops out a few minutes later , wearing a pair of white sunglasses .
Wait , how did he get those sunglasses ?
He does n’t have his wallet with him .
When I ask about them , Alex knows what I ’m getting at .
He walks back to the elderly shopkeeper , waits until she ’s not looking , and drops the shades on the ground behind her .
Then he taps the woman on the back .
“ Excuse me , ma’am , I think you dropped these . ”
The lady turns around and takes the sunglasses .
Alex is grinning .
“ What a good boy , ” she says .
Alex does n’t always get away with things .
In fact , he ’s annoyed a few of the adults in his life with his antics .
At the San Gennaro Festival , Vinny Peanuts got mad at him for squeezing customers for tips while selling torrone .
In only a few hours , Alex had amassed more than $ 150 in gratuities , all in singles .
“ Alex , ” Vinny said .
“ You ca n’t keep asking the customers for tips .
It makes them feel uncomfortable . ”
“ You ’re just jealous , ” Alex snapped back .
Vinny threatened to send him home , but Alex called his bluff .
“ Send me home then .
You make more with me here , and you know it . ”
“ Some kid , ” was all Vinny could say .
Alex also ran into problems at the NikeID store , especially when his juvenile sense of humor highlighted the yawning age difference between him and everyone else in the store .
One day , a client with a large nose came in to design his own sneakers .
As everyone sat around the computer , Alex typed in a suggestion for words that could appear on the side of the shoe : big nose .
Alex cracked up .
His colleagues did n’t .
Occasionally , he was sent home from NikeID .
The primary force behind these banishments was “ Super ” D.J. Clark Kent , the hip - hop producer who famously discovered Jay - Z and can often be found hanging around the store .
“ All of this ca n’t possibly be good , ” says Kent about Alex working there .
“ The reason Alex is bored is because people let him do whatever he wants .
Someone has to be the grown - up around here and tell this kid to go home and do his homework . ”
One afternoon in Soho , Alex spotted Kent on the street and left his friends to rush right over .
He wanted to hang .
Kent did n’t .
“ I said to him , ‘ Alex , we ’re not friends .
We cool .
But we ’re not friends .
You ’re 13 . I ’m 40 . ’
He ’s just completely out of his mind .
He thinks we ’re the same age . ”
Alex never told his parents about getting sent home from NikeID .
“ Alex would never want us to see all the humiliations he must go through , ” Robin says .
She ’s appalled by Kent ’s comments —
“ Who is he to tell me how to raise my son ?
He does n’t really know Alex ” — and suspects there ’s more to his sending Alex home .
“ Alex is competition for D.J. Clark Kent , ” Robin says .
“ All the attention Alex gets , that ’s attention D.J. Clark Kent is n’t getting . ”
The attention Alex gets also bugs his 16 - year - old sister , Zoe .
“ It ’s annoying .
That ’s all I can really say about it … it ’s just really annoying , ” Zoe says .
“ I ’m his older sister , and when I walk around the neighborhood people know me as ‘ Oh , are n’t you that cool little kid ’s sister ? ’
That ’s really who they think I am : sister of the mayor of Nolita . ”
“ I said to him , ‘ Alex , we ’re not friends .
We cool .
But we ’re not friends .
You ’re 13 . I ’m 40 . ’ ”
Her frustration with Alex is partly personal .
“ He wo n’t hang out with me anymore , ” she says .
On weekend mornings , Zoe and Alex used to go for breakfast together , then he got too busy .
“ It was never that great anyway , ” she says .
“ It ’s not like we got to have bonding time .
He ’d leave the table and talk to everybody in the restaurant . ”
( It was n’t entirely horrible : “ We ’d always get a cup of free coffee or pancakes on the house . ” )
But his big sister also wants to protect Alex as he weaves through the world .
If you ca n’t choose between being a kid and being an adult , Zoe explains , you can be left stranded between the two .
And what happens if all the attention dries up ?
Who will Alex be ?
For now ,
Alex does n’t seem too interested in Zoe ’s concerns .
He ’s busy building his empire of connections .
One night late this summer , we drove to a concert in East Hampton .
James Taylor was playing .
Alex had never heard of him , but it was a chance to meet A - listers and Alex did n’t want to miss it .
He was in fine form .
First , he bumped into David Blaine , the magician , who was biting quarters with his hind teeth .
Alex did n’t need an introduction ; they had friends in common .
Blaine made a card disappear for Alex .
“ So , what do you think of that ? ” he asked .
Alex shrugged , unimpressed , and the crowd cracked up .
He moved on and stumbled upon Paul McCartney .
“ Hey , what ’s your name , young man ? ” McCartney said .
But Alex was n’t interested in talking to a Beatle .
“ Are n’t there any professional athletes here ? ”
He looked around .
A tall man passed .
Finally , a ballplayer !
Alex introduced himself .
“ This kid is mad cool , ” said C.J. Miles , shooting guard for the Utah Jazz , within minutes of making Alex ’s acquaintance .
“ He knows some of the same people we know from around the league . ”
“ C.J. , ” Alex asked , “ do you have your own plane ? ”
“ Man , I do n’t even have a house .
You know how NBA politics are .
I ’m going to Europe , ” Miles joked .
“ You should go to Israel , ” said Alex .
“ They bless basketballs there .
Baruch ata Adonai , Elohenu melech ha’olam , boray peri ha swish .
Swish !
Swish ! ”
Miles and his friends slapped their knees .
“ Yo , this is the funniest kid ever . ”
An entourage began to form .
Miles , his friends , their friends .
They followed Alex as he chatted up a group of models and the party promoter who brought them , and then back to the gourmet buffet , and then over to the espresso bar .
“ You are so cute , ” said the espresso girl , as Alex ordered his third decaf cappuccino .
“ Oh , I just want to marry him . ”
When she looked back over at Alex , she blushed .
“ That little shit , he ’s blowing me kisses . ”
Alex and his newfound posse were the last to leave the party .
When he finally made his way to the parking lot , he was trailing two ( stolen ) potted plants — daffodils for his mom , fresh basil for the next morning ’s omelette — four gift bags full of swag , and one NBA player and six of his friends .
On the way out , he saw David Blaine drive by in his Bentley .
“ Hey , David , ” Alex shouted .
“ Do n’t bend my quarter ! ”
It was too early to call it quits , and Dune , the nightclub , was suggested as a next stop .
“ I do n’t know if Al can get in , ” one person said .
Alex was offended .
“ If I can get into Bungalow 8 , I can get into Doooone . ”
By the time we arrived at the club , the line at the door was twenty deep .
The beefy bouncer looked at Alex and shook his head .
No way .
Alex found a back door and knocked .
Nothing .
He found another door and knocked again , putting his ear close to listen .
Nothing .
Finally ,
Alex conceded defeat .
“ That club sucked anyway , ” he said as he got back in the car .
It was 1:30 in the morning .
He rolled down the windows and turned up the music , as if ready for more .
Then he fell dead asleep .
Curled up in the passenger seat , he looked , for the first time that night , like a kid .
Neocon accused of misquoting Iran 's leader to push case for invasion Nick Juliano

One of the countrys most prominent neoconservative pundits has been accused of using a fabricated quote from Irans supreme religious leader in pushing his argument that a US invasion is the only recourse to deter that countrys nuclear ambitions .
Norman Podhoretz is among the most vocal in urging President Bush to bomb Iran , and he has predicted the president will launch an attack before his term is up .
Podhoretzs argument is based on his belief that a nuclear - armed Iran would not be deterred from launching its missiles because its leaders do not fear their countrys destruction .
The Economist has called into question an oft - cited statement Podhoretz attributes to Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini , saying it is likely bogus . 
Podhoretz , a prominent adviser to Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani , is unbowed in his push for war , and he says he accurately quoted Khomeini saying the following :
We do not worship Iran , we worship Allah .
For patriotism is another name for paganism .
I say let this land [ Iran ] burn .
I say let this land go up in smoke , provided Islam emerges triumphant in the rest of the world .
The Economist quotes Shaul Bakhash , a Middle East scholar at George Mason University , who thoroughly researched the alleged quotation , which was first cited by Iranian journalist Amir Taheri .
Bakhash could find no evidence that those words ever crossed the Ayatollahs lips .
 This research , I think , clearly establishes that the alleged quotation is a fabrication ,  Bakhash writes in a private newsletter for Gulf experts .
The scholar searched the Library of Congress , a database of Farsi - language holdings at libraries worldwide , books published in Iran and a presumably comprehensive database of Khomeinis statements , speeches , fatwas , etc.  and could not find the quotation Podhoretz and other Iran hawks are so fond of .
Andrew Sullivan , blogging at The Atlantic , jumps at the chance to undercut Podhoretzs apparent misquotation .
 One should not expect intellectual honesty from Norman Podhoretz .
So I have no hope he will respond to this post at the Economist ,  Sullivan writes .
Podhoretz shoots back , accusing Sullivan of shrill hysteria and relying on his original source to back up the quotes validity .
Taheri tells Podhoretz that the quote appeared in  Paymaha va Sokhanraniyha - yi Imam Khomeini ( Messages and Speeches of Imam Khomeini ) published by Nur Research and Publication Institute ( Tehran , 1981 ) .
 The quote , along with many other passages , disappeared from several subsequent editions as the Islamic Republic tried to mobilize nationalistic feelings against Iraq , which had invaded Iran in 1980 ,  Taheri writes .
 The practice of editing and even censoring Khomeini to suit the circumstances is widely known by Iranian scholars . 
To Podhoretz , this is all the proof he needs that the Khomeini quote is accurate ; he further pushes back against claims from the Economist that another quote from former Iranian President Rafsanjani is inaccurate .
But even the quotes are inaccurate the case for war against Iran remains , he argues .
 Since the case I make rests on much more than the two quotations from Khomeini and Rafsanjani ,  he says , it would still stand even if those quotations were in fact bogus or fabricated .
Ugh , we were already sick of digital photo frames -- and now it looks those now - discontinued virus - ridden Insignia units from Best Buy and several other models produced in China were carrying a much nastier trojan that we 'd originally heard .
According to an analyst form Computer Associates , the trojan , called Mocmex , is able to block more than 100 types of security and anti-virus software from killing it , and bypasses the Windows firewall to download files from remote locations , spreading them randomly over your hard drive and any portable storage device you plug into your PC -- like , for example , a digital photo frame .
The trojan is apparently set to only steal gaming passwords at present , but CA says it 's capable of stealing nearly any information on your machine , and thinks it might be a test for a much worse virus yet to come .
Infected frames have come from Sam's Club , Target and Costco , in addition to Best Buy , so we 'd say to avoid picking one up until this mess gets sorted out -- or , you know , forever .
Once - Great , Now - Disgraced American Company Also Facing SEC Probe , Lawsuits , Upcoming 2008 Election Meltdowns
Not to Say We Told Ya So , Diebold Shareholders ...

The death spiral for the 131 year - old company , once respectfully known as Diebold , continues , as its stock price falls to a 5 - year low today , near year 's end ( currently $ 29.23 / share and still sinking , from a 52 - week high of $ 54.50 / share ) , along with the additional news that the U.S. Department of Justice has now joined the SEC in an investigation concerning the company 's " Enron - like " bookkeeping tricks ...
Diebold Inc. ( NYSE : DBD ) said it has learned that the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an investigation that parallels a previously disclosed investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the company ’s discontinued practice of recognizing certain revenue on a “ bill and hold ” basis .
Diebold announced in early October that it has been engaged in an ongoing discussion with the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant regarding its former use of the " bill and hold " method of recognizing revenue .
Under bill and hold , ownership of a product contractually passes to a customer and revenue is recognized by the supplier prior to delivery of the product to the customer .
Diebold said it ’s in continuing talks with the Office of the Chief Accountant so that it can determine what the company termed “ the most appropriate revenue recognition method ” to replace its bill and hold practice .
The BRAD BLOG , of course , originally reported on the SEC 's investigation into Diebold 's book - keeping chicanery back in May of 2006 , just a few months after our first exclusive report , based on information from a company insider we dubbed DIEB - THROAT , preceded a 20 % stock - price plunge just days afterward .
At the time , back in late September 2005 , the stock price plunged to a 52 - week low of about $ 44.37 / share ( which we 're sure they 'd kill for now --- not that we wish to give them any ideas ) and DIEB - THROAT told us in response to the related news : " the last time this kind of deception occurred it was called Enron . "
Then came a class action securities fraud suit against the company in December 2005 , as first broken by The BRAD BLOG natch , before the parallel SEC investigation first became public .
Since then , following one independent study after another after another after another , finding their electronic voting systems to be virus - prone , hackable , unreliable and inaccurate , the company finally dumped it 's controversial CEO who had infamously promised in a Republican fundraising letter that he was " committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to " George W. Bush in 2004 , before attempting again to fool the American public by renaming its election division " Premiere Elections Solutions " ( same pig , fresh lipstick ) , just after stock prices plummeted again in August of this year to $ 47.60 as The BRAD BLOG noticed what appeared to us , and at least one financial analyst , to be possible insider trading among a number of company officials .
Prices have continued to fall ever since --- a lucky coincidence , no doubt , for those executives who just happened to unload a bunch of stock near the year 's high at $ 53.05 - to today 's 5 - year low of $ 29.20 .
Additional bad news arrived last Friday for Diebold when a new study by the state of Ohio found their systems to be easily hackable ( again ) , with better news coming last Tuesday as the state of Colorado 's own certification tests , surprisingly , gave their their machines a pass while decertifying many others .
Yesterday , however , the reason for the inexplicable get - out - of - jail card they received in CO may have become a bit clearer :
As it turns out , the Republican Secretary of State who oversaw the new certification testing , Mike Coffman , is running for Congress , and his campaign shares the same consultants as Diebold / Premier in the state .
Go figure .
Diebold / Premiere 's spokeshole , Chris Riggall told the Rocky Mountain News in response yesterday , that the company just had no idea about the extraordinary conflict of interest .
But with the mission already accomplished , he announced to the paper : " Effective tonight that relationship is terminated . "
With their stock - price still spiraling this morning , Diebold is quoted by Crain 's Cleveland Business today as saying the company " anticipates [ the DoJ ] review will be completed in the first quarter of 2008 " ...
Though rest assured ,
The BRAD BLOG 's review of the company wo n't be completed by then .
Not by a long shot .
Merry Christmas , Diebold !
And if you 'd like to wish The BRAD BLOG a Merry Christmas , we hope you 'll feel free to consider sending a much needed ONLINE DONATION --- in dishonor of Diebold ! --- as the holiday grows near .
MICHAEL MUNGER , the jocund chair of the Duke University department of political science , has published a lucid and charming explanation of the theory of the firm .
Firms are little command and control structures involving lots of central planning .
If markets are so great , if allocating resources according to price signals is so efficient , then why have firms at all ?
So , one day the boss has this crazy thought .
He asks himself a question that has never occurred to him before :
Why have any employees at all ?
Why have a building ?
Why not just sit home , wearing his jammies and bunny slippers , sipping a nice cup of tea , and outsource everything ?
He can write contracts to buy parts , he can pay workers to assemble the parts , and he can use shipping companies to box and transport the product .
If you suspect this will not turn out well , you 're right , and Mr Munger explains why :
The cost savings from division of labor would be swamped by the increased cost of negotiating and carrying out transactions , and monitoring quality .
That 's why the " firm " is not really a market at all .
The ideal of socialist planning is a giant , nation - sized firm .
So hey , why not ?
Because just as total outsourcing is inefficient , so is total insourcing .
Efficient firms require market competition to find the ever - shifting sweet spot .
All firms use some combination in - house work and outsourcing ( no computer company makes its own furniture , grows the wheat for bread in the employee cafeteria , or makes waste paper baskets ) .
Where is the line ?
How does the company decide what to buy , and what to produce ?
The answer is : profits .
The company has to decide which approach , at every stage , costs less , improves quality , or in some other way increases profits .
Of course , the line changes constantly as new technology changes the costs of various form of contracting , coordination , and monitoring .
That is one important reason why companies that become too comfortable in one mode of organisation and management are certain to eventually take a beating from more nimble competitors .

The Governor has refused to take a position since he was a gubernatorial candidate .
Hold him to his commitment to paper ballots and tell him we want them hand counted .
Write to the State Board of Elections and tell them to stop considering what 's best for the vendors and start thinking about what 's right for the people .
Now is the time to write and write some more :
If not , New Yorkers will lose their once constitutionally protected right to vote and when we go to the polls there will be computers programmed by at best irresponsible voting vendors standing between us and our right to choose our representatives .
If you vote on a computer , your vote might count , but then again it might not .

What do you think are the reasons why high school students make it — but stop there ?
College is a whole four years , but not everyone goes through with it .
What holds them back ?
We looked at several sources on the Internet and found that these are the main contributing factors :
Homesickness and feeling that you do n’t fit in .
It ’s a whole new world out there , and you may not be ready to embrace it .
Educational burnout .
While college gives you control and flexibility over your schedule , the hard demanding schedule , challenging courses , and boatload of homework certainly has turned a lot of students away from the desire to continue .
Academic unpreparedness .
Sometimes , high school did n’t really prepare students for college .
Other times , students slacked off in high school and paid the price during their post - secondary years .
The high school goal was to pass ( so that students could get into college ) ; in college , it is to succeed .
Personal or family issues .
You may have had an unfortunate illness in the family or you yourself just got totally get stressed out from the workload .
Financial constraints .
Tuition costs continue to soar , and scholarships or grants are not always available .
Additionally , financial situations can change from year to year .
Too much fun — but not enough education .
Some students take advantage of their friendships , which could put them on academic probation due to suffering grades or absence in classes .
The school is n’t a good academic fit for the student .
You ’ve selected a great school that is very arts - centric .
However , you realize that you like the sciences better .
Similarly , you may hate the average class size of 100 and prefer much smaller classes for more individualized attention .
Setting sights on the wrong major .
You may have wanted to be a doctor but after taking several science classes , you decided that you ’re rather go into marketing .
Does your school have a marketing major ?
If not , you ’re likely to go elsewhere .
No guidance or mentors .
In high school , teachers and counselors were there to guide you , as high school classes are typically smaller than the entering freshman class .
It ’s a lot harder to get the personalized attention that you ’ve been used to and that could turn people off quickly .
External demands , particularly within part time or full time employment .
Can we say Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook ?
When the job puts too many demands on you , you may have to choose , and money usually wins out .
Time to move out .
If the cold winter just does n’t suit you , you may decide to go elsewhere .
You may want to go closer to home or to be closer to a significant other .
Why have your peers dropped out of college ?
“ Contraception is wrong because it ’s a deliberate violation of the design God built into the human race , often referred to as ‘ natural law . ’
The natural law purpose of sex is procreation .
… sexual pleasure within marriage becomes unnatural , and even harmful to the spouses , when it is used in a way that deliberately excludes the basic purpose of sex , which is procreation . ” — http://www.catholic.com/library/Birth_Control.asp
Among Christian religions , it is a common teaching that the “ natural ” purpose of sex is for the creation of children , and that any other reason for sex is sinful and a subversion of God ’s law .
This belief underlies a great deal of Christian attitudes toward sex , including the religious right ’s condemnation of homosexuality and extramarital sex and the Roman Catholic church ’s opposition to birth control .
However , while the overtly theocratic manifestations of this belief – denying civil rights to gay couples , denying emergency contraception to rape victims , attempting to ban pornography , refusing to teach young adults accurate information about sex , opposing the development of vaccines for STDs – have been attacked , and rightfully so , as far as I am aware the belief itself has rarely been challenged .
That is unfortunate , because as in many other things , this is an area where the religious right stands on very shaky ground .
This post will accordingly examine the facts , or lack thereof , supporting this belief .
First of all , it would seem that if the purpose of sex – the reason for sex ’s existence – is procreation , then all or most acts of sex should result in pregnancy .
However , this is not the case among human beings .
Consider what anthropologist Jared Diamond has to say in his book The Third Chimpanzee :
… even young newlyweds who omit contraception and make love at maximum frequency have only a 28 percent probability of conception per menstrual cycle .
Animal breeders would be in despair if a prize cow had such low fertility , but in fact they can schedule a single artificial insemination so that the cow has a 75 percent chance of being fertilized ! ( p.77 )
As Diamond points out , human beings are far less fertile than most animal species .
And , please note , the numbers Diamond quotes are for young newlyweds .
Human fertility declines steeply as we age , especially in women but also in men .
Female fertility peaks between the ages of 20 and 24 , begins to decline as early as the late 20s , and drops off more sharply during the 30s .
By age 45 , the vast majority of women are infertile ( 1 , 2 ) .
Even if an older woman does become pregnant , her chance of miscarriage remains substantially higher than a younger woman’s .
The Bible itself says that the human lifespan is between seventy and eighty years ( Psalms 90:10 ) , and given the advances in lifespan brought about by improved nutrition and modern medicine , we can safely use the higher estimate .
We should then ask why , if sex is intended for procreation , it is all but impossible to use it for that purpose for about half of our natural lives .
Even during the biologically brief window of maximum fertility , our rate of conception is significantly lower than that of most other animals .
If sex ’s only or primary purpose is procreation , then it would seem to be a badly designed mechanism indeed , considering how inefficient it is for that purpose .
There is yet another biological argument that suggests that the primary purpose of sex is not procreation .
In our species , females do not experience estrus – that is to say , human women do not go into heat .
Virtually every other species of mammal does , and in many of those species , the onset of estrus is marked by conspicuous physical changes that advertise the female ’s sexual availability .
For example , female chimpanzees ‘ genitals become swollen and bright pink when they are ovulating , a sign that is obvious at a glance .
By contrast , ovulation in humans is not just not advertised , it is concealed : there are no external physical or behavioral signs that reliably indicate when a woman is capable of becoming pregnant .
In addition , the length of the female menstrual cycle exhibits much more variation than cycles of estrus in other mammals , making accurate prediction difficult .
( Ironically , although the rhythm method is unreliable for humans , it would work great for gorillas . )
These facts , as Jared Diamond points out , ensure that most human sex acts will take place at the wrong time for fertilization .
Again : if the religious right is correct and sex was designed by God primarily for procreation , why would God make it so difficult to use it for that purpose ?
Why would he design human beings so that we must have sex many times to stand a good chance of initiating a pregnancy ?
These difficulties persist as long as one clings to the view that the only reason for sex is procreation .
But if we discard that assumption , the matter comes into clear focus .
An alternative explanation that accounts for the facts much better is that sex has two primary purposes : for procreation and also for pair bonding .
And while pair bonding strengthens the family structure needed to raise healthy children , that is not its only purpose .
In nature , it can also be used as a stress reliever , to strengthen group cohesion , as social currency , and simply for pleasure .
Even homosexual sex exists in nature .
Are animals violating “ natural law ” when they use sex for these purposes ?
The concealed ovulation of females , and the constant receptivity of both genders , not just allows but encourages human beings to have sex more often than is strictly necessary for procreation .
One might say that we are designed this way .
If we abide by the religious right ’s simplistic arguments about what is natural or what we are meant to do , we are not just guided but compelled to the conclusions drawn in this essay .
However , we , unlike other animals , are not rigidly bound by the dictates of evolution and instinct .
We are not required to abide by what is “ natural ” .
( If the religious right were consistent , they would also oppose eyeglasses and surgery for appendicitis – and priestly celibacy !
– since those things are just as “ unnatural ” as condoms or birth control pills . )
The purpose of sex is whatever we decide it is , and so long as we do not use it in ways that harm others or infringe on their equal right of self - determination , that decision is our right to freely make .

In an abrupt change of position , the US intelligence agencies now say they do not know if Iran intends to build a nuclear weapon .
The report says Iran may still face problems enriching uranium
The unclassified version of a new National Intelligence Estimate , or NIE , released on Monday , said that Iran was " less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 " .
In May 2005 , the intelligence community had said " with high confidence " that Iran was " determined " to build nuclear weapons .
The new NIE confirms that Iran did , indeed , have an illicit nuclear weapons programme .
But it says that programme ceased operating in 2003 and , as of mid-2007 , had probably not started up again .
The NIE asserts that the weapons programme was dropped because of international pressure .
It says that US intelligence estimates - with " moderate - to - high confidence " - that Iran currently does not currently have a nuclear weapon .
The NIE affirms , however , that Iran continues its efforts to enrich uranium .
The document estimates that the very earliest Iran could produce enough highly - enriched uranium ( HEU ) for a weapon would be late 2009 , but some time between 2010 and 2015 is more likely .
In an interesting note of dissent , the state department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research does not think enough HEU for a weapon could be produced until 2013 .
Intelligence gaps
In all , the new NIE argues that Iran 's intentions may be less threatening than US intelligence previously thought .
And it strongly suggests large gaps in the Americans ' knowledge of exactly what the Iranian programme is capable of .
But the document emphasises that Iran continues to build a capacity which could be turned to nuclear weapons production in the future .
" Iranian entities are continuing to build a range of technical capabilities that could be applied to producing nuclear weapons , if a decision is made to do so , " it reads .
Iran continues to insist that its programme is for civilian purposes .
The Bush administration welcomed the NIE , even though it might be seen to contradict the administration 's warnings about the gravity of the Iranian threat .
The National Security Adviser , Stephen Hadley , said the report showed that the risk of Iran 's acquiring a nuclear weapon remained a " very serious problem " .
Mr Hadley said that the NIE showed that the US had the " right strategy " in pressuring Iran to suspend its entire nuclear programme , while offering to negotiate .
His statements suggest that the new NIE will not engender any profound shift in policy on the part of the Bush administration , and that Washington will continue to push for a new round of UN sanctions against Iran .
Complicating factor
But Washington analysts were predicting that the intelligence community 's new position would complicate the effort to bring about a new UN Security Council Resolution imposing sanctions .
Such a resolution was still within reach , they said , simply because Iran has not complied with demands to suspend uranium enrichment .
But , they said , the US will be hard put to maintain a sense of urgency following the release of the new NIE .
However , the new NIE will make it harder for proponents of military action against Iran to argue their case .
One source , who has close links to US intelligence , said that members of Vice President Dick Cheney 's staff continued to call for military strikes against Iran " on a daily basis " .
Senior military officers and intelligence officials are understood to have grave reservations about an attack on Iran - not least because it would be unclear how a military confrontation with Iran could be brought to a conclusion .
The purported transcript may re-open the JFK conspiracy debate
The transcript records an alleged conversation between assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby , who killed Oswald before he could face trial .
The two men discuss a plot to kill the president a month before his 22 November 1963 murder in Dallas .
A Dallas official said he did not know whether the transcript was genuine .
Conspiracy debate
The transcript was found in a Dallas courthouse safe with other papers related to the assassination .
Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins said he was told about the contents of the safe when he took office in 2007 .
He showed a news conference the alleged transcript , a leather gun holster used to carry the gun that Ruby shot Oswald with , and a movie contract signed by Henry Wade - the Dallas District Attorney when Mr Kennedy was killed .
President Kennedy was shot as he rode in an open - topped car
" It will open up the debate as to whether or not there was a conspiracy to assassinate the president . "
Staff at Mr Watkins ' office have been busy cataloguing the items since the safe was opened last year .
One theory is that the transcript is a fake - part of a movie script that Mr Wade was working on .
In the transcript , Oswald and Ruby discuss a way to " get rid of " US Attorney General Robert Kennedy - JFK 's brother - by killing the president .
Robert Kennedy was launching a crackdown on the mafia in the US at the time .
The conversation purportedly took place at a nightclub in Dallas owned by Ruby .
An investigation by the Warren Commission into the Kennedy assassination maintained that Oswald probably acted alone , although other inquiries challenged this conclusion .
An Indian doctor named Amit Kumar was arrested in Nepal earlier this month , accused of being the leader of a " kidney theft ring " that supposedly took up to 500 kidneys from unwilling donors over the past nine years .
Stories circulated that some poor and uneducated Indian peasants were even forced to give up their organs at gunpoint .
Stories of organ theft proliferate on the Internet , and surface once in a while in the mass media .
There are two basic types of organ - snatching stories :
One involves a traveling businessman who meets up with a femme fatale , is drugged , and wakes up with an organ missing .
The other involves vulnerable people ( usually children and the poor ) from Third World countries who are forcibly taken for their organs .
A typical claim is that children in India , the Philippines , and Latin America are kidnapped ( or killed ) and their organs sold to rich Americans or Europeans .
Scary , huh ?
But is it true ?
While newspapers and magazines profit from sensational headlines about vampiric organ thieves , the truth is that there is little evidence to suggest that organ theft rings operate in India or anywhere else .
Consent vs. force
As with many legal and criminal issues ( for example , rape or abduction ) the crux of the issue comes down to consent .
Dr. Kumar claims that all the organs were willingly offered , and the logistics of organ transplant supports his defense .
It is virtually impossible to remove a usable organ from an uncooperative donor and place it in a recipient .
Kidney transplants are not simple procedures that can be done in someone 's kitchen .
Sophisticated medical equipment must be used , and donors and recipients must be carefully matched .
Blood and tissue typing and histocompatibility tests must be done in advance ( thus with the " victim 's " cooperation ) .
The operation would take between four and six hours and involve ten to twenty support staff , including three members of a surgical team , an anaesthesiologist , and two nurses .
It would be a practical impossibility in America or the West to assemble a large team of highly trained medical personnel willing to engage in such illegal and unethical behaviors .
Even highly paid medical staff in India are unlikely to risk performing such operations , jeopardizing both their careers and reputations .
Theft vs. commerce
While tales of organ theft are very suspect , there certainly is organ commerce in the world .
In some countries selling one 's organs is perfectly legal .
In the United States , it is against the law , although some have suggested that legalizing it would save lives and be beneficial to all involved .
In India , for example , many adults voluntarily sell one of their kidneys .
( Of course the dramatic scar looks the same whether the organ was stolen or sold . )
Although the sale of kidneys is seen by many in the United States as morally objectionable , it should be remembered that in India , as in many developing countries , sophisticated medical equipment is rare and in many cases the resources simply are not available to extract and preserve organs of those killed in accidents for later transplant .
Few Indians who suffer from kidney failure can afford dialysis treatments , so they can either die or purchase a kidney .
In 1994 , the Indian parliament passed a law making it illegal to buy or sell human organs for transplantation , but a loophole in the law allows people who are related to the recipient only by " ties of affection " to donate organs under some circumstances .
One can debate the ethics of exploiting poor people who are willing to sell their organs , but this should not be confused with organ theft .
Dr. Kumar may in fact be guilty of the charges against him , though often when the truth comes out , it is much less horrific than first claimed .
Previous case
The last high - profile case of organ selling made headlines in December 1989 when a Turkish man named Ahmet Koc claimed that three months earlier , he had been brought to London , England , with the promise of a job .
When he went in for a medical check , he was given an injection which he believed to be a blood test , but he woke up the next day to find that a kidney had been removed .
He was told not to be upset , because he would be well paid for his loss .
It was later revealed that Koc lied .
He was not the victim of organ theft ; in fact he was one of four Turks who voluntarily sold their kidneys that day in September of 1989 .
He was apparently unhappy with the amount paid him , and went to the press with his story .
Although transplanting brokered kidneys was legal at the time in Britain , three London doctors who participated in the transplant were found guilty of professional misconduct .
The Dr. Kumar story this month is following a familiar pattern , complete with sensational claims and lurid headlines .
That Dr. Kumar , like many doctors , removed organs from the poor and uneducated is almost certain .
Yet exploiting economically vulnerable people is hardly a crime — American businesses have done it for decades ( just look at the huge payday loan industry ) .
Whether Dr. Kumar is guilty of actually stealing kidneys from unwilling donors is far less likely , and another matter entirely .

You bend down and whisper quietly in her ear , " Stay with Mommy , honey , " knowing full well that this reasonable request is a foolish attempt to dampen the temper tantrum that is rising like a tsunami inside your kid .
With a pounding heart , you scoop her up and run from the store before someone shouts , " Bad parent .
Dreadful child .
Get out ! "
No one knows why 2 - year - olds have temper tantrums , but most of them do .
It starts with mild anger over something simple but then quickly escalates into full blown fury dramatized by screaming , fist pounding , foot - stomping , and screaming .
The child also descends psychologically into a place where they can't be reached by words or physical comfort , and parents stand by helpless and confused .
Clearly , the child is distressed , but to the parent , the distress seems way out of proportion to the situation .
And it is physically stressful for the child , which suggests that there must be some evolutionary reason why temper tantrums are so universal for little kids .
Pediatrician Harvey Karp , author of " The Happiest Toddler on the Block , " and an expert in getting babies and toddlers to quiet down , claims that tantrums are an expected product of human development .
He sees our little darlings as less - evolved savages driven by instinct and emotion , not thoughtful reasoning , and he suggests it 's our job as parents to civilize them into Homo sapiens .
And so , Dr. Karp suggests , in the midst of a tantrum a parent should reach way back to our ancient ancestors and think like a Neanderthal and become one with the child and figure out how to stop the screaming .
His method is to speak in short phrases that reflect the primitive emotions of the child ( " You are angry " ) rather than addressing the adult modern Homo sapiens situation of the moment ( " Please stop .
Big girls do n't scream in stores . " )
Apparently , nothing infuriates these little Neanderthals more than Homo sapiens logic .
They just want to be heard and their emotions acknowledged and a tantrum is best controlled by the simple , " I hear you .
I feel you . "
Of course , Dr. Karp maligns
Neanderthals by suggesting there were instinctual creatures swayed by emotions rather than thought .
Neanderthals did n’t have language , but they had bigger brains than modern humans and could probably do logic problems with the best of us .
His advice is better couched in the notion that Homo sapiens , and presumably our ancestors , were designed to feel very deeply , and little kids simply want their emotions acknowledged , just like adults .
In fact , adults spend millions of dollars each year to talk to counselors and get their feelings heard .
And relationships work best when people are able to see and hear each other 's pain , misery , happiness and joy .
And so parents need not read the history of human evolution to know how to deal with their unruly kids .
All we have to do , even in the middle of the most embarrassing public tantrum , is to reach inside and feel that same frustration and anger with the world , and then bend down and say , as Dr Karp would , " I know just how you feel . "

It 's fair to say that Viggo Mortensen has mixed feelings about his Oscar nomination , and the awards season in general .
" I do n't know why I was included this time .
I certainly have n't gone out and done the campaign that one is supposed to do , " he says , in so diffident a mumble I have to lean to catch his words .
" If you 're lucky , you get a lottery ticket , then you have to go find some nice clothes , wash up and go , and it 's very flattering , and my mother is very happy about it .
But like most people - unless they 're very practised at it or have no warm blood at all in their veins - I feel a little apprehensive about the red carpet .
It 's always a bit bewildering when people are taking pictures and asking questions before the ceremony .
I 'm not very good at giving quick answers , and that 's what they want .
So I end up saying half a sentence , and then they go , ' OK , thank you ! ' and I 'm thinking , ' WHAT did I just say ? ' "
The whole business , he supposes , is just a teensy bit ludicrous .
Mortensen does n't want to sound unappreciative about his inclusion on the best actor Oscar shortlist for his work in David Cronenberg 's Eastern Promises , but a ) he is indignant that his director has failed to score any nominations , and b ) he is under no illusions about winning .
Indeed , if ever there 's a bad year to be up for best actor , this is it , with Daniel Day - Lewis inexorably locked on to target .
" I 'm realistic , " Mortensen says .
" I know I 'm the odds - on favourite to remain seated throughout the ceremony . "
Mortensen , 49 , arrived in London from Washington state yesterday .
He comes down from his room jetlagged , barefoot and wet - haired , smelling quite deliciously of soap , and makes short work of the two double espressos that have been cooling on the table waiting for him .
A slight , thoughtful presence , he 's bearded in preparation for his role in The Road , an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy 's post - apocalyptic novel , co-starring Charlize Theron ; he has just completed Ed Harris 's western Appaloosa , and Good , from the CP Taylor play set in 1930s Germany .
Mortensen was 43 when he landed the role of Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings , ending a long stint on the supporting actors ' bench ( The Indian Runner , Carlito 's Way , Portrait of a Lady ) , but his choices since then - including a previous film with Cronenberg , A History of Violence - have shown a taste for the unexpected and small - scale .
He likes the freedom that comes with limited budgets , where the directors tend to be " left more in peace " by producers ; he also likes scripts that take him somewhere new .
" I do n't have a set plan .
I like to learn things .
That 's the main thing I like about my job . "
Divorced and with a son at college , Mortensen is famous for immersing himself in his characters ' lives long before he steps on set .
This is along with an engaged political interest - he backed the shortlived presidential campaign of progressive Democrat Dennis Kucinich , and will now settle for Obama , though he sounds less than rapturous : " Both he and Clinton have so many corporate ties that are unsettling to me .
Perhaps he has fewer .
And the movement that 's behind him may plague his conscience so much that I think he 'll get us out of Iraq sooner than Hillary Clinton will .
So , that 's our best chance . "
It means that he 's viewed by the industry with respect and bafflement ; certainly his young LOTR colleagues talked about him as some sort of visionary or seer .
" This basic thing I always do : what happened between the character 's birth , and page one of the script ?
Anything that 's not in the story , I 'll fill in the blanks . "
This has always been Mortensen 's approach , even for rinky - dink starter roles such as his brief appearance in Witness , where he appears in straw hat and shirtsleeves for the famous barn - building scene .
It made the long haul of fruitless auditioning particularly draining - he got this close to the Christopher Lambert role in Greystoke , to the Willem Dafoe role in Platoon - but at least he came away better informed .
For Eastern Promises , in which he plays Nikolai , implacable fixer for a London - based family of Russian mobsters , his research informed not just his performance but the plot itself .
The tattoos that play such a key role , for instance , only found their way into the script after he read a book on the subject .
Just before shooting , he went backpacking , solo , around Moscow , St Petersburg and the Urals .
( Languages are not a problem .
Born to a Danish farmer father and an American mother , he grew up in Venezuela , Argentina , New York state and Denmark .
There 's a UN patch on his sweatshirt and if you ask him where he 's based , he says , hippyishly , " Planet Earth , mostly . " )
The travelling , he says , informed more than his performance .
" It changed the way I read Russian literature , poetry , history ... it changed the way I felt about things I 'd read before .
I like what I learn in preparation .
That 's the main thing . "
His character in Good , a German professor , finds refuge in music , and while filming in Budapest , Mortensen started hankering after a piano , though he'd never played before .
An old piano tuner loaned him an upright , " and I asked the hotel if we could bring it in the back door if I promised to put pieces of wood under it or something ...
So we put it in the room and I started playing a little bit , and I played it more and more , to the point where every night , rather than looking at the script , I 'd just play the piano while thinking about tomorrow 's work , and it was really helpful . "
Nothing goes to waste .
As we 're finishing up , he hands over a CD , entitled Time Waits for Everyone .
Composition , performance , production , cover photography : he did the lot , then released it via his own company , established with the LOTR cash dump .
( It 's minimalist , melancholy , entirely listenable and owes a certain debt to Satie . )
Mortensen , then , is a bit of a polymath .
He paints , writes poetry and has exhibitions of his photographs lined up in Iceland and Denmark later this year .
" I can remember being seven or eight and waking up in the morning and going , shit , I 'm going to die .
Not because I was afraid of dying , but there was this sense - I still have this once in a while - that there 's so much to see and do .
It made me want to seize the day , whatever you want to call it .
Pay attention . "
He only began to think about acting after college ( he studied government and Spanish and - a characteristic flourish - embarrassed his parents by boycotting graduation robes in protest about the manufacturers ' poor labour practices ) while living in Denmark , delivering flour to bakeries and selling flowers on street corners .
Growing up , he had n't been exposed to much cinema , so he educated himself : " Older European movies , Japanese movies .
In particular I remember Meryl Streep in The Deer Hunter .
I saw a really poor print of Maria Falconetti in Carl Dreyer 's The Passion of Joan of Arc : she 's amazing .
Bergman 's movies , Autumn Sonata .
Bresson .
Jessica Lange in Frances .
What I saw was a way of doing the job of make - believe that was more than just entertainment .
And when it really was well done , as well as appreciating it as literature or art , something else happened , which was that I started wondering : what 's the trick ?
I started being curious about how it worked , how I was moved to really believe what I was seeing , if it was done well . "
In New York , he joined a drama workshop , was picked up by an agent and began the long slog .
" I started getting close to getting jobs - repeatedly .
The first couple of years I did screen - tests like Greystoke maybe twentysomething times .
I 'd do my best , but never got one . "
So why did he stick with the acting ?
" On balance , even though it was mostly disappointments and frustrations and embarrassments , there was something about it that I liked , and still like . "
Film reconciles the sprawl of his interests : philosophy , history , psychology , photography , music .
Sure , it 's an odd business , with plenty of pitfalls , but he thinks he has a pretty healthy take on it .
" But then , " he says , " if I had a really healthy attitude , I would n't be in the industry at all .
So I must be somewhat contaminated . "

A scientist at a Houston university has created the darkest known material -- about four times darker than the previous record holder .
Pulickel Ajayan , a professor of engineering at Rice University , created a carpet of carbon nanotubes that reflects 0.045 percent light , making it 100 times darker than a black - painted Corvette , the Houston Chronicle reported Monday .
Please , read the following story for pictures and more details on this research : www.physorg.com/news120227809.html
" The final numbers , when we measured how dark this material was , were more dramatic than we thought , " Ajayan said .
Ajayan said the material , which has been submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records , may have some practical applications .
He said the material 's ability to absorb light could be beneficial to solar panels and it also minimizes the scattering of light , making it a potential boon to telescope manufacturers .
The previous darkest known material , a nickel and phosphorus alloy created by scientists in London , reflected about 0.16 percent of light .

See all the orange on this world map ?
That represents all the damage we have done to our planet ’s oceans as a result of fishing , pollution , and activities that are cause for climate change .
This is the first time such a map has been drawn out to document the overall impact of human activity and what I see here is shocking and depressing .
Only about 4 % of our oceans ( near the poles ) are relatively untarnished , but marine eco-systems are significantly damaged everywhere else , of which 40 % face serious environmental degradation .
The BBC has put together a video that shows the same along with an explanation from Ben Halpern — one of the marine ecologists who helped put this map together .
On a positive note , identifying the problem on a global scale and understanding its seriousness means we are in a better position to work towards fixing things , perhaps with a higher level of consciousness .
When I read information like this , I always feel a lump in my throat because on a personal level I do n’t do anything that contributes to helping the situation .
Honestly , in this case I do n’t even know if I can .
I could spend time researching and figuring it out for myself , but I do n’t see that happening .
Laziness , helplessness , no - time , call it what you will .
Just like is often done for the global - warming issue , the media needs to keep flashing us pointers on how , on an individual level , we can help the situation without having to dedicate all our free time to the cause .
Even if a small percentage of people heed the pointers given , in addition to focused efforts by eco-experts , it would help the problem , no ?

the three things
tell them about it
if all else fails
“ Could you describe the product management process for me ? ” leads to an oportunity to talk about your product management experience or your experience working with product managers .
“ What tools do you use for source code management , builds , and bug tracking ? ” is a great opportunity to talk about your experience with the full software development life cycle , not just the coding .
“ How do you plan and track ship dates ? ” turns the conversation towards how well you estimate dates , manage priorities , and your track record of shipping code on time .
back to square one
List your three things you want the interviewer to know about you that you think they are unlikely to find out if they ask all the questions ;
Write a one - paragraph description of for each thing that you could use to ‘ coat tail ’ onto another question ;
Think of a question you could ask for each thing that would naturally lead to a discussion .
I ’m helping some colleagues interview programmers , and for once I ’d like to offer some suggestions to the interviewees and not the interviewers .
This post is about using the interview to maximize your chance of landing the right job .
First , you need to walk in with an objective .
No , not “ , ” but a simple , tactical objective for the interview .
Here ’s what I suggest .
Think of
The important ideas are that ( a ) you want the interviewer to know about each of the three things , and that ( b ) the interviewer is unlikely to ask about all three if you do n’t exercise some control over the interview .
Let ’s start by ruling a few things out .
First , do n’t bother with how many years of technical experience you have with the company ’s tools and platforms .
If they are using in - house Common Lisp macros compiled to C and then distributed on a grid with MapReduce , I guarantee that they will ask whether you have any Lisp or distributed programming experience all by themselves .
( You can still take advantage of your experience , I ’ll show you how below . )
Second , rule out anything that does n’t really help sell them on you .
Yeah , yeah , hockey is competitive and it takes a special kind of focus to be a goalie .
I get that , but it really only sells when the interviewer is also a hockey player .
My suggestion is put that kind of thing at the bottom of your resumé and let them ask about it if they care .
The three things you want to take into the interview should be stuff that matters to them but is hard for them to ask about .
Stuff that does n’t pop out of your resumé .
I do n’t have a pat formula for generating these items that I can share , but here are a couple of ideas to get you started .
Remember the technology buzz - phrases we rejected ( “ five years of JEE ” “ Common Lisp ” ) ?
Think about the difference between yourself , presumably an expert in these areas , and someone who has only worked on one project with the same technology .
You both touched all the same tools and code , but there ’s something special about you , your extra experience means something .
What is it ?
Joel Spolsky and Peter Norvig both suggest that you cannot pick up a new programming language or platform and become proficient overnight .
That being said , if you tell me that you have five years of experience , I have no idea whether you have five years of experience or whether you simply did the same thing over and over again .
What is it that you learned that makes you special ?
What secrets to you possess that ca n’t be listed on your resumé ?
For each person , there will be different answers .
One person might say that their “ secret sauce ” is that they have learned the ins and outs of the platform , they know what works and what does n’t , they know how to work around the shortcomings .
Another might emphasize the non-technical skills .
I would personally be impressed with anyone who said that what makes them special is that they are very , very accurate when they estimate tasks and projects .
This leads naturally to another area I would mine for nuggets :
Soft or non-technical skills.99 % of the dreck you read about interviewing programmers is about finding out whether they can actually write programs .
Rightly or wrongly , most interviewers focus on the hard skills .
But if they never get around to discovering your ability to juggle priorities , or write effective technical documentation , or analyze requirements , how will they know that you are far and away superior to the other five people they will interview this week ? , that ’s how they ’ll find out .
Walk into the interview with your three things .
Now , the interview is a game .
Presuming you do n’t get thrown out or you do n’t walk out before it ends , you win the game if the interviewer discovered all three of your things .
If you like games as a metaphor , call themIf the interviewer asks you about one of your things , that ’s an easy goal .
Take it .
If the interviewer asks you if there ’s anything you ’d like to mention about yourself , that ’s an easy goal .
Talk about one of your things .
If the interviewer asks you about something related to one of your things , answer the interviewer ’s question and then ‘ coat tail ’ your thing onto the end .
For example : :
It says here you worked on JProbe , that ’s a Java tool , right ? : Absolutely .
JProbe is a suite of tools for JEE Server - Side development ( answers the interviewer ’s question ) .
Under my management , we released three consecutive versions on schedule .
I ’m really hoping that there ’s an opportunity to apply my focus on hitting plan to this team ( adds on ) .
Watch politicians “ staying on message . ”
Now matter what question they are asked , they spit out their own pat statements .
You do n’t want to be that plastic , but you have to take responsibility for a a successful interview .
And you know what ?
If the interview ends with your best features undisclosed , the company loses as well .
One more time with the coat tail : : What ’s your experience with Ruby ? :
Well , I was the lead developer on the Certitude project .
We built that with Rails and we included a fairly heavy dose of Ruby idioms , including a domain - specific language for pattern - matching and lots of dynamic meta- programming ( answers the interviewer ’s question ) .
One of the things I discovered on that project was the importance of a bomb - proof quality control process when you have such a powerful language .
I customized our continuous integration server to track changed files , tests , bugs in a unified report interface so we could monitor the most troublesome modules .
It really saved our bacon late in the project when we had to really tighten up our risk management to ship on time ( the add on , emphasizing the process ) .
Perhaps you did n’t get a good opportunity to mention your three things and the interview is winding down to a close .
Do n’t try a desperation coat tail where you try to stick two completely unrelated things together .
Instead , try using a question to introduce one of your things indirectly .
Some examples : Opportunities to ask questions should not be wasted on trivia like the company ’s dental plan or whether they prefer cubicles to private offices ( actually , neither are trivial , but they are not important until you have given the interviewer every reason to hire you ) .
My suggestion is to only ask questions about areas where you have something positive to contribute if the question leads to a spirited discussion .
And the best way to make that happen is to plan in advance .
You have three things you want to say , and you should walk into the interview with three questions you can ask that will turn the conversation towards your agenda .
So here ’s how to get started .
Good luck .

Update !
I got a chance to look at the European release of ICO , and pretty much immediately noticed the new files SRCFILE .
TXT and TRFILE .
TXT .
SRCFILE is the complete ' objdump - d ' output of the game , with the debugging line numbers , and TRFILE is the complete linker log .
Which includes these function names :
00136cc0:0003215616:0710:ffff:huft_build ( ) : fumi/ios / inflate .c:119 00137488:0003244212:0160:ffff:inflate_codes ( ) : fumi/ios / inflate .c:335 00137bd0:0003268411:00c0:ffff:inflate_stored ( ) : fumi/ios / inflate.c:439 00137ef0:0003278744:04d0:ffff:inflate_fixed ( ) : fumi/ios / inflate.c:485 00138150:0003288348:05e0:ffff:inflate_dynamic( ) : fumi/ios / inflate.c:549 00138a68:0003319614:ffff:ffff:inflate_start ( ) : fumi/ios / inflate .c:706 00138ab8:0003321500:0030:ffff:close_inflate_handler ( ) : fumi/ios / inflate .c:750 00138b80:0003324593:00d0:ffff:inflate ( ) : fumi/ios / inflate.c:772 00139048:0003340442:0040:ffff:open_inflate_handler ( ) : fumi/ios / inflate .c:730 001390d8:0003343118:0060:ffff:fill_inbuf ( ) : fumi/ios / inflate .c:887 001391b8:0003346411:0020:ffff:huft_free ( ) : fumi/ios / inflate .c:309 00139568:0003361590:0040:ffff:new_mblock_node ( ) : fumi/ios / mblock.c:16 00139668:0003365214:ffff:ffff:reuse_mblock1( ) : fumi/ios / mblock.c:95 00139690:0003365880:ffff:ffff:init_mblock ( ) : fumi/ios / mblock.c:12 001396a0:0003366175:0030:ffff:new_segment ( ) : fumi/ios / mblock.c:72 00139748:0003369314:0030:ffff:reuse_mblock ( ) : fumi/ios / mblock .c:105 001397a0:0003370659:0060:ffff:strdup_mblock ( ) : fumi/ios / mblock.c:123
This matches perfectly with all the stuff down here .
I 'm going to stop looking now , in case the Japanese release has Fumito Ueda 's credit card numbers on it or something .
I have n't suceeded in contacting anyone about this ; SCEI and ONICOS / Izumo do n't read their email .
Someone who speaks better Japanese than me should try writing them a letter .
Summary
ICO , a video game by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 , seems to be using parts of the GPL library libarc for compressed data handling .
It does n't credit the author or mention libarc or the GPL .
This is n't a big problem in terms of code — the two files from libarc used are under 1500 lines put together , and one is a heavily - edited copy of inflate . c from zlib , which is public domain .
But , it 's a GPL violation , and they need to fix it .
Evidence
To follow along with this , you 'll need :
Reverse - engineering ( interesting )
ios / inflate .c incomplete literal tree incomplete distance tree ios / mblock .c
ICO , helpfully , has all its debug logging still in the release binary .
Here we can see the names of two files from libarc .
Note the space before " incomplete " in both strings ; this indicates a really old version of zlib .
Even find - zlib , which claims to go back to zlib 0.1 , does n't have these .
( It also does n't find any data tables . )

Reverse - engineering ( boring )
Now that we 've seen that , it 's time for MIPS assembly !
I 'll be using ps2 dis 's output here .
The equivalent to fprintf ( ) is located at 0x001A6E28 in the binary .
It 's been simplified - the first argument is missing , but I 'll use the same name for clarity .
Searching for those error strings finds this :

I could go further , but pointing out more of the same control flow in a bunch of assembly text is n't really needed .
Instead , I wrote a tool to decompress ICO 's data archive , using libarc .
libarc 's compressor ( in deflate . c ) uses the same DEFLATE algorithm as gzip , but does n't store a gzip or zip header .
Nevertheless , it decompresses all the files perfectly * without any messing with the compressed stream needed .
Get it in the links below .
( " advertise.pss " is an MPEG - 2 video and will play in VLC , although it wo n't have sound . )
* It does n't have a checksum , so it might not actually be perfect , but it does n't error at least !

The extractor .
Run it with a copy of ICO 's DFDATAS / DATA.DF as the first argument .
Does n't do sub-archives yet .
Etc .
Shadow of the Colossus , the " sequel " to ICO , does n't seem to use any other code .
I have n't disassembled it , but it 's even more helpful : function names are n't stripped at all !
All of them look safe to me , aside from being as unorganized as any game code .
I tried contacting Masanao Izumo , the author of libarc , but one of his emails ( mo@goice.co.jp ) stopped working and I have n't received a response on the other ( iz@onicos.co.jp ) .
Maybe he can be reached through ONICOS ?

As reported earlier , Rep. Dennis Kucinich plans on forcing this issue before Thanksgiving .
From Brad Blog —
“ You know , I introduced House Resolution 333 because I heard from the American people and they said they wanted some response to make Dick Cheney accountable for the statements that he made that took us into a war based on lies .
And the statements he made that would take us into a conflict against Iran .
Again , more lies .
The President is now openly invoking the specter of World War III with respect to Iran .
He ought to be held accountable also .
I ’m the only member of Congress who stepped forward on the issue of making Dick Cheney accountable .
And now we have 21 members who ’ve joined me .
That ’s a step in the right direction .
But I ’m going to go beyond that .
I ’m going to call a privileged resolution , at which point , would force a vote — at least if it ’s only on a procedural motion — members are going to have to confront this issue of impeachment .
They ’re not going to escape it .
This is a question of defending our Constitution .
It really is . ”

私の主たる仕事は、グラフィックスおよびテキストデータを編集してドキュメント上にレイアウトすることであり、こうした作業を90年代中盤から既に10年近く続けている。この種のページレイアウト用プログラムとして私が最初に出会ったのはQuarkXpressであったが、程なくしてAldus（後のAdobe）PageMakerに切り替え、その後も各種のバージョンを使用してきた。PageMakerの後継者であるAdobe InDesignを使い始めたのは数年前のことである。
こうした経験から言えるのは、各種のテキスト、表、グラフィックス（ベクトル系およびラスタ系の両フォーマット）をスムースにインポートしてフォーマット指定するワークフローへの対応が、優れたページレイアウト用プログラムにとっての不可欠な要件であるということだ。
インストー ル
Scribusのインストールについては、最新バージョンの入手法が分かりづらいため、多少の注意が必要だ。それと言うのもScribusのWebページでは最新の安定バージョンは1.3.3.9であると紹介されているのに、それよりも新しいバージョン1.3.4に関するニュースリリースが昨年5月の段階で既に出されているのである。同リリースにはバージョン1.3.4のダウンロードページへのリンクが張られており、私の場合もそこから入手したソースファイルをコンパイルすることでインストール用パッケージを作成している。またこのページからは、その他アーキテクチャ用のRPMファイルを入手することもできる。
かく言う私である がLinux.comに掲載されたバージョン1.3.4のリリース記事を目にしなければ、おそらくその存在に気づきはしなかったであろう。実のところバージョン1.3.4は開発リリースという位置付けにされているのだが、安定版と開発版リリースの相違点など、オープンソースの開発サイクルに詳しくない人間にとっては些細な違いでしかない。
外部ファイルのインポート
Scribus 1.3.4
一般のワードプロセッサとは異なり、ページレイアウト用プログラムでは、そのドキュメント上に配置するコンテンツは他のプログラムにて作成しておくことを前提にしている。よって1つのドキュメントを構成する場合、そこに配置するテキストはワードプロセッサなどの文章作成プログラム、グラフィックスはIllustratorやInkscapeなどの図形描画プログラム、写真データはPhotoshopやGIMPなどのラスタ系イメージ編集プログラムにて別途用意しなければならない。そのためこうした各種のファイルフォーマットのインポートおよびページ上での細かな配置設定への対応は、優れたページレイアウト用プログラムに求められる重要な要件となる。
Scribusの場合も一般的なファイルフォーマットについては正常にインポートできるのだが、私が最初に使い始めた当時、意外なことにMicrosoft
Wordファイルを読み込めなかったため大いに落胆させられたことがあった。実務の現場においてはMS
Wordが広範に使用されている以上、テキストデータをWordフォーマットで提出する人間が多数存在するからである。ところがヘルプファイルを読んでみると、ScribusのインポートプロセスではAntiwordというユーティリティを介してWordバイナリファイルをテキストに変換してから読み込むという仕様になっていたのだ。実際Scribusはその起動時にAntiwordの有無をチェックするようになっており、私の環境でもこのユーティリティをインストールしたところ、Scribusで問題なくWordファイルをインポートできるようになってくれた。
グラフィックスについて はScribusの場合、EPS、TIFF、JPG、SVG、PNGなどのラスタ系およびベクトル系イメージフォーマットを正常に読み込めるだけでなく、（驚くべきことに）ネイティブのPhotoshop PSDファイルをそのまま扱うことができる。
ただし表組み関連のデータについては、それほど対応度は高くない。例えば空白の表を挿入すると、Scribusはこうしたテキストボックスを勝手に表セルとしてグループ化してしまうのである。よって表の配置後にテキストを挿入するといった場合は、このようなグループ化をいちいち解除しなければならない。いずれにせよ、表のインポートはうまく行かない場合があるものと覚悟しておく必要があるだろう。この問題に対するソリューションの1つは、他のプログラム（OpenOffice.org
Writerなど）で表を作成する場合に、完成したデータをPDFファイルで保存しておき、Scribusにはグラフィックスとしてインポートするという方法が考えられる。
ドキュメントのセットアップとフォーマット指定
Scribusでも他のページレイアウト用プログラムと同様、テキストおよびグラフィックスの格納コンテナとして機能するフレームを必要な数だけページ上に配置する方式が採用されている。こうしたパブリケーションの大部分を占めるのがテキストである関係上、最大の作業時間を取られるのがテキスト関連のレイアウトおよびフォーマット設定である。実際、複数のテキストフレームを配置してテキスト移動用のフレーム間リンクを設定するのは非常に手間のかかる作業だが、Scribusにはこの作業プロセスを自動化する機能が設けられている。具体的にはドキュメントの設定時に、各ページ上におけるテキストフレームの自動描画オプションを有効化しておけばよく、このオプション適用下では作成されるテキストフレーム間リンクも自動的に設定される。
なおこのテキストフレームの自動作成機能が最も役立つのは、複数ページにまたがる分量の単一テキストを配置する場合である。例えば以前に私は、1ページ分に満たない短い文章が大半を占める40個以上のテキストファイルを配置するという作業にて、テキストフレームの自動作成機能を試してみたことがある。この場合、テキストフレーム間のリンク群を個別に解除しないとファイル別のテキスト配置ができなかったため、結果的にScribusによるテキストフレームの自動配置で節約できた以上の時間を費やすことになってしまった。
テキストのインポート後に行うのは、段落および文字単位のフォーマット設定である。Scribusではスタイルマネージャを介してスタイルの設定と適用をする方式になっているが、私の使った限りそのインタフェースは操作性に難があるよう感じられた。各種属性のうち、ジャスティフィケーション、スペーシング、インデントを規定する段落スタイルが、フォントのサイズとカラーを規定する文字スタイルを包含しているということが直感的に分かりづらいのである。より重大な問題として、特定スタイルに対する設定変更が、その適用済みテキストに正しく反映されない場合がある点も指摘しておかなければならないだろう。
マスタページは一種のページテンプレートであり、ヘッダ、フッタ、ページ番号などページ間で共通する要素を配置しておくために使用する。これらの要素は通常のページ上で変更することはできない。Scribusでもこうしたマスタページ機能に対応しており、複数のマスタページを使い分けられるようになっている。
残念ながらイメージおよびグラフィックスに対しては、フォーマット指定を一括で自動適用する方法は存在しないようである。例えば私の場合、配置する各イメージに対してワードラップ処理をさせることが多いため、これを新規に挿入するイメージ用のデフォルト設定としておきたいのだが、Scribusにおけるその種のデフォルト指定機能が見つけられないままでいる。またScribusでは、テキストおよびグラフィックスボックスといったオブジェクトの表示設定についても、カラー指定などのごく限られた機能しかサポートされていない。こうしたオブジェクト関連の表示機能としては、テキストおよびグラフィックスボックスのドロップシャドウ効果などが用意されていてもよさそうなものなのだが。
まとめ
Scribusについては、本文中で解説したようにいくつかの欠点が残されているものの、そうした制限を承知した上で使うのであれば、実用に耐えるページレイアウト用プログラムとして推奨してもいいだろう。もっとも、テキストフレームを一括してコピー＆ペーストする場合などに原因不明のクラッシュに遭遇したケースが何度かあり、こうしたトラブル発生の頻度がもっと低ければ総合評価をもう1ランク高くしておきたいところである。
Scribusを商用ページレイアウト製品と比較した場合、複数の点において見劣りする事実は否めない。例えばそのインタフェース構成はPageMakerやInDesignほど洗練されておらず、直観的な操作を大きく妨げている。特に強く感じたのは、マスタページの設計、段落スタイルの作成、インポートテキストのフォーマット指定に関する機能の不備で、これらの完成度は同種プログラムより数ランク劣っていると言えるだろう。このような不満については、Adobe製品使用歴の長い者が評価しているが故の偏見と受け止められるかもしれないが、Scribusのwikiに掲載されている開発ロードマップでも、いくつかの機能には改善の余地があり、PageMakerなどの古参プログラムに比べて未成熟であるとの記述がなされている。
その他にも、1つのパブリケーションを構成する複数のScribusファイルを単一のブックとして管理するユーティリティの不在は、重要な問題であると見なせるだろう。こうしたブック管理ユーティリティが特に役立つのは、ドキュメントを構成する各章を個別のファイルとして整理する場合であり、その際に求められるのがブックに登録するファイルの管理機能および、全ファイルで共通化させる、マスタページ、スタイル、ページレイアウトなどの自動適用機能である。
色々と未成熟な部分が残され たScribusであるが、コストパフォーマンス的に抜きんでた存在であることに間違いはなく、特にLinuxユーザが利用可能な最高のページレイアウト用プログラムという点は高く評価すべきだろう。またScribusユーザは、Scribusの機能やインタフェース的な不足分を補うためのPythonスクリプトを独自に多数開発しており、これらはScribusのwikiページにて公開されている。いずれにせよScribusの開発チームは、実用的なDTPプログラムの構築に成功したと総括していいはずだ。このままScribusの開発作業が継続していけば、商用製品に匹敵するレベルの完成度に達することに間違いないだろう。

High seas may force the US navy to postpone an attempt to shoot down a failed spy satellite , the defence department said this afternoon .
The USS Lake Erie , a cruiser that has the job of firing missiles at the satellite , is caught in bad weather in the north Pacific .
" We do n't anticipate the weather being good enough today , " an officer told the Associated Press .
However , the source said conditions could improve sufficiently in the next few hours for an effort to be made .
A final decision will be made by the defence secretary , Robert Gates .
The Pentagon had been waiting for the space shuttle Atlantis to return to Earth before launching the missiles .
" We 're now into the window , " a senior military officer said after the shuttle landed today .
The US military wants to shoot down the satellite as a " precautionary measure " , but critics say the move is a step towards the militarisation of space .
The Bush administration says it is necessary to destroy the satellite - which failed shortly after its 2006 launch - because it is carrying toxic rocket fuel .
Nasa fears the craft could pose a risk to populated areas as it falls back to earth .
Critics say the use of missiles to destroy the satellite is further evidence of the Pentagon 's desire to test its space weapons .
The US navy has modified its Aegis anti-missile radar system for the exercise , making clear that its missile defences can quickly be adapted to shoot down a satellite .
Targeting the satellite will allow the Pentagon to test key elements of its space defence system , including identification and tracking , at the joint space operations centre at Vandenberg air force base in California .
" Whatever their motivation for shooting down the satellite , it 's clear that this will be quite useful to the military , " Joan Johnson - Freese , an expert on military space issues at the naval war college in Newport , Rhode Island , told the Washington Post .
The US defence department has been developing weapons that can shoot down satellites or missiles for decades .
In 1985 , the air force successfully tested an air - launched missile to shoot down a satellite .
Early last year , China earned widespread condemnation when it shot a ground - based missile at an old satellite in space , amid fears of a space arms race that would include the targeting of satellites .
Thomas Fingar , a deputy director of national intelligence , told Congress last week it would not be difficult to inflict serious damage on US defence capabilities by targeting its satellites .
China and Russia have pushed for a UN treaty to ban weapons in space .
The US , which abrogated the antiballistic missile treaty in 2002 , has opposed the proposal .
A delegation from Paris including Cécilia Sarkozy , the wife of the French president , and Benita Ferrero - Waldner , the EU commissioner for foreign affairs , arrived in Libya at the weekend to negotiate their return home .
France had been seeking the return of the six - in jail for the past eight years - as a final goodwill gesture from Libya after it commuted their death sentences in favour of life in prison .
The accord included measures to improve the medical care of children with HIV / Aids in Libya , the French presidential palace said .
Bulgaria 's president , Georgi Parvanov , expressed satisfaction with the long - awaited return home of the medics .
" The dramatic case of the sentencing of innocent Bulgarian citizens is at its end , " Mr Parvanov 's press office said in a statement .
" We are still sympathetic to the other tragedy - the one of the infected Libyan children and their families . "
Nicolas Sarkozy and the European commission president , José Manuel Barroso , welcomed " the gesture of humanity by Libya 's highest leader " , the same statement said , adding that they were also grateful to Qatar for mediating in the case .
Before the nurses were handed over , Libyan officials said on condition of anonymity that Mr Sarkozy was to visit Libya tomorrow provided that the medics were allowed to go home .
Bulgaria made an official request last week for Tripoli to repatriate the medics to serve their sentences in Bulgaria .
It also granted citizenship to the Palestinian doctor , Ashraf al - Hazouz , last month .
This latest visit to Libya was Ms Sarkozy 's second on behalf of the prisoners and , like the first , it drew criticism from the opposition Socialists at home .
One opposition MP said the president , who took office on May 16 , was profiting from the work of other nations and the EU , which have worked on behalf of the nurses for years .
The medics were sentenced to death in December 2005 after being convicted of infecting 426 children with HIV while working at a hospital in the city of Benghazi .
Fifty - six of the children have since died .
In jail since 1999 , the medics always maintained their innocence and said they were tortured to make them confess .
Western scientists say negligence and poor hospital hygiene were the real culprits and that the six were scapegoats .
Last week Libya 's high judiciary council commuted death sentences on the six following the decision of the victims ' families to drop demands for their execution after receiving compensation payments .
after suffering religious discrimination in Switzerland
LAS VEGAS , Dec. 6 – “ I came to the United States seven years ago because of religious discrimination in Switzerland , ” said Raelian Guide Thomas Kaenzig , who heads the Raelian religion in Nevada .
“ Now I ’m standing up for religious freedom here – for my right to omit all religious references in becoming a U.S. citizen since religious freedom also means having the right to choose no religion at all .
After lots of red tape , I was granted a God - free citizenship oath - taking ceremony on December 7 here in Las Vegas . ”
Kaenzig said he lost his job in Switzerland because of his beliefs .
“ As a Raelian spokesperson , I bashed the Vatican in an interview with Switzerland ’s major newspaper , Blick .
I was n’t wanted on company projects after that .
I was jobless . ”
Raelians deny the existence of a personal deity .
Instead , they honor the Elohim – extraterrestrial scientists who created life on Earth , including humans , through genetic engineering – and they follow the teachings of Rael , the Elohim ’s Last Prophet .
The Raelian Movement founded by Rael now includes some 65,000 members in 90 countries .
“ As a Raelian , I objected to three things in the standard naturalization procedure , ” Kaenzig said .
“ I object to an oath saying I ’ll bear arms to defend the country ; to an oath ending in ‘ so help me God , ’ and to a public ceremony violating separation of church and state .
The judge , a public official , typically pronounces ‘ so help me God ’ at the end . ”
Kaenzig said alterations to the citizenship oath have been permitted before but that he was probably the first to insist upon omitting all religious references from the oath ceremony , including those made by the judge .
Hotel magnate Barron Hilton , grandfather of heiress Paris Hilton , has bequeathed 97 % of his estimated $ 2.3 - billion net worth to his father ’s charity foundation , officials said Wednesday .
The contribution to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation , to come from the sale of Hilton Hotels Corp. and the pending sale of Harrah ’s Entertainment Inc. after the money is placed in a trust , is the largest in the foundation ’s history and will bring its value to about $ 4.5 billion .
Barron Hilton , 80 , pledged an immediate $ 1.2 - billion donation to the foundation , with an estimated $ 1.1 billion to follow after his death .
The Holmby Hills resident is the foundation ’s chairman .

“ Working to alleviate human suffering around the globe , regardless of race , religion or geography , is the mandate of the foundation set by my grandfather . . . and now reinforced by my father , ” Hilton ’s son Steven M. Hilton , president and chief executive of the organization , said in a prepared statement .
Paris Hilton , the most famous of Barron ’s 23 grandchildren , could not be reached for comment .
She has built her own moneymaking empire with a popular TV reality show , movie cameos and a hit single , plus appearances shilling perfume , burgers , books and canned champagne .
Hotelier Conrad Hilton , Barron ’s father and Steven ’s grandfather , established the charity in 1944 and left nearly all his fortune to the organization when he died in 1979 .

The foundation , with offices in Century City and Reno , is the third - largest in Los Angeles County behind the California Endowment , with $ 3.8 billion , and the J. Paul Getty Trust , with $ 8.6 billion , according to the Los Angeles Business Journal .
Two decades ago , Barron Hilton fought the foundation in court , disputing the charity ’s ownership of a controlling 27.4 % interest in Hilton Hotels Corp .
He then split the shares ’ roughly $ 650 - million value with the foundation after a protracted legal battle .
The charity has committed $ 560 million over more than six decades for programs to house the mentally ill and to increase access to safe drinking water in Africa and Mexico , among other projects .
This month , the foundation awarded a $ 1.6 - million grant to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University to help provide stable housing for drug and alcohol users to aid in their recovery .

The foundation also awards a $ 1.5 - million humanitarian grant each year , one of the world ’s largest .
This year ’s recipient , Tostan , is a West African nongovernmental organization that works to educate people with little or no formal schooling and combat female genital mutilation .
The Hilton organization distributes about $ 60 million a year , and that amount is expected to increase with Barron Hilton ’s substantial gift , said Barbara Casey , a foundation spokeswoman .
A significant portion of the money supports the work of Roman Catholic nuns ; more than half the foundation ’s grants go to international projects .
The Hilton hotel chain consists of more than 500 hotels around the world .
Conrad Hilton bought his first in Cisco , Texas , in 1919 .

The failure of four undersea cables in less than a week is stoking suspicions that saboteurs want to disrupt internet traffic passing between Europe and the Middle East .
But there 's little more than suspicions to work with since no one has yet to even reach the damaged cables .
The first two failures occurred last Wednesday when fiber - optic cables connecting Europe with Egypt were sliced .
Telecom representatives initially blamed the outages on damage from ships that were in the area .
Egyptian government officials later said there had been no ships in the area at the time of the cuts and that the space , in fact , was off limits .
As a result , Egypt at one point lost about 70 per cent of its traffic to the outside internet .
Connectivity in India was also noticeably affected , according to reports .
Connectivity in the regions has since improved as traffic has been rerouted .
More recently , two additional cables have failed .
One of them travels between the Qatari island of Haloul and the United Arab Emirates island of Das .
The other passed between the UAE and Oman .
For a while , there were reports the outages knocked Iran off the internet .
In fact , the country 's connectivity remained relatively unscathed .
These latter outages , it turns out , have caused fewer disruptions because one cable carried more regional traffic and the other , a redundant , " self - healing " strand of fiber allowed the cable to continue to function , just not at full capacity .
And as it turns out , the outage in the cable linking Qatar and the UAE was caused by problems related to a power failure , rather than a cut , according TeleGeography , a firm that provides research and consulting services to underseas cable operators .
The much bigger effect has been the fodder the unlikely number of failures have had on internet bloggers , who have attributed the downing of the lines to the actions of everyone from Al Qaeda to intelligence operatives working for Israel or the US .
Some have speculated the disruption was designed to prevent Iran from bringing a new oil trading exchange online .
Others claim it 's the work of cable maintenance companies trying to create more demand for their services .
" I 've seen all kinds of just crazy , crazy postings on Digg , " said Stephan Beckert , a research director at TeleGeology .
" It 's completely absurd speculation on the web right now and nobody really knows anything . "
One post , for example theorized a well funded operation was at work after learning expensive cutting torches may have been used .
In fact , repair crews are still scrambling to the location of the cuts , so no one has yet seen the damaged cables .
Like with most conspiracy theories , we 're missing a few key pieces of the puzzle .
The root cause of the three cut cables remains a mystery .
At one point , incorrect reports brought the number cut cables to five , causing even more sober security watchers to wonder if maybe there was something more afoot than simple error .
" It is really odd , " uber - security researcher and thinker Bruce Schneier , said of the spate of outages .
" I hate to fuel conspiracy theories because I tend not to believe them , but it would be nice to know if this is just a really weird coincidence . "
In a blog posting here Columbia University computer science professor Steven Bellovin put it this way :
" As a security guy , I 'm paranoid , but I do n't understand the threat model here .
On the other hand , four accidental failures in a week is a bit hard to swallow , too .
Let 's hope there will be close , open examination of the failed parts of the cables . "
According to Beckert , there 's nothing unusual about the number of outages .
There are about 100 cut cables every year , enough to keep a fleet of 25 cable repair ships fully occupied .
Most are caused by fishing mishaps , but ship anchors and geological causes such as earth quakes also play a role .
The first two cables to be knocked out were located within a few kilometers of each other off the coast of Alexandria , Egypt , making it likely that they both suffered damage from the same event .
That means there was only one other cut .
So it looks like the tin foil - dawning contingent will have to jump on another story to feed their conspiracy fetish .
This one , it would appear , is coming up empty . ®
THE economics blogs continue to buzz with the aftermath of Michael Cox and Richard Alm 's New York Times op - ed on consumption inequality .
The prevalence of technical arcana about weaknesses in various sets of consumption data in the rebuttals of left - leaning economists suggests some measure of desperation to make the key finding go away .
But it is more than secure : the level of consumption inequality is much lower than income inequality , and has increased much less , no matter your favourite data source .
Furthermore , as a conceptual matter , it remains that consumption is a much better measure of material well - being than income , and consumption inequality a much better measure of the real differences in standards of living .
This should be obvious enough , but it is grating for those who would like to use income inequality data as a political cudgel , but who really know better .
Of course , there is also good bit of technical arcana that reinforces the weakness of income measures .
For example , Arnold Kling highlights this passage from a new - ish working paper [ pdf ] by Bruce D. Meyer and James X. Sullivan :
The bottom deciles of consumption exceed those for income , suggesting under - reporting of income .
There is a high and rising under - reporting rate for government transfers , a source of income that is particularly important at the bottom .
That is to say , income measures systematically mislead about the level of consumption at the bottom of the income distribution .
This just supports what we already know : responsible scholars worried about real inequality will prefer the consumption numbers when good ones are available .
Or , if they are disatisfied with the quality of the consumption data sets , will work to see them improved .
The important question to my mind is n't whether real consumption inequality is especially terrible these day , but whether it is still decreasing .
There should be no doubt that Americans have become more equal in real standards of living over the long term .
( Even Paul Krugman admits this . )
But how about since the 1970s ?
To the question of whether real consumption inequality -- or , to get right down to it , welfare inequality -- has narrowed or widened over the past few decades , Tyler Cowen is emphatic about our ignorance :
We do not know how inequality of welfare in America is faring over say the last thirty years .
This is a point of overriding importance .
Just in case you missed it , let me repeat : when it comes to the kind of intra-nation inequality that we should really care about ( if we are going to worry about intra-nation inequality at all ) , we " do not know . "
As in " know " and " not " put together .
The reason " we " do n't know this is that " we " do n't agree on how to measure welfare .
The popularity of happiness or life - satisfaction measures has blossomed among economists largely due to the conviction that they provide a more accurate measure of welfare than does income or consumption .
And we do in fact know that inequality in welfare , measured in this way , has been decreasing in America and other wealthy countries over the last thirty years .
Of course , this fact only makes some inequality hawks suspicious of happiness data .
For his part , Lane Kenworthy would like to draw our attention to wealth inequality :
While there is less inequality of consumption than of income , the flip side — because those with high incomes are able to save and invest much more — is that inequality of wealth is much greater than inequality of income .
...
If we focus on spending , we miss this key part of the inequality story .
Yes , but the inequality story that really matters is inequality in well - being or welfare .
The main way wealth contributes to welfare is by financing consumption , which is why we should look to consumption to understand how people are really doing .
Mr Kenworthy suggests that in addition to future consumption " income saved becomes an asset that provides financial and psychological security , " and this is true .
Money in the bank does create peace of mind .
So , is Mr Kenworthy suggesting that there is increasing inequality in peace of mind ?
How would one measure that ?
With a life satisfaction survey ?
In an excellent post on all this , UC Davis economics grad student Will Ambrosini leaves us with this important throught :
Often times , popular discussions of this topic have an air of back filling and data mining .
People have some policy they want to implement and then they go squeeze data until it supports their policy .
Call me naive , but I think policy should be guided by the science not the other way around .
A truly excellent idea !
Astronomers have confirmed the origin of the Quadrantid meteors as a " deep - space explosion " of a comet in 1490 which was observed in China , Japan and Korea , New Scientist reports .
Fourteen astronomers last week tracked the shower 's annual display during a nine - hour flight from California to the North Pole .
Peter Jenniskens of NASA had previously followed up suspicions that it was caused by the debris of the 1490 event , in which observers spotted a comet " following a path similar to that of the Quadrantids " , and which suddenly " flared up " .
Jenniskens calculated that this relatively young stream would be narrow , and therefore " easily deflected by Jupiter 's gravity " .
He predicted that accordingly it would " arrive a few hours earlier than if it were an older , more diffuse stream " , peaking at 0200 GMT on Friday .
The astronomer 's observations confirmed this .
Apart from the Quadrantids , the 1490 exploding comet left a more substantial piece of debris - a near - Earth asteroid dubbed 2003 EH1 . ®

Schieffer : [ W ]e do n't hire our generals to rubber - stamp every idea their civilian bosses come up with .

What kind of PERSON would insist , or even ALLOW himself , to be paid to raise money for those who were wounded while serving under him ?

LA Times : Giuliani trails GOP rivals in key early states RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 12 , 2007
Print This Email This The Los Angeles Times is reporting that although Rudy Giuliani still leads the other GOP presidential contenders in national polls , he is far weaker in several crucial early primary states .
A new LA Times / Bloomberg poll shows Giuliani trailing Mitt Romney in Iowa and New Hampshire and Fred Thompson in South Carolina .
However , none of the Republican candidates has inspired any real enthusiasm even among their supporters .
In addition , the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll shows that Giuliani 's national standing has slipped from 37 % in July to 28 % today .
# Excerpts from Los Angeles Times : Key findings about the Republican front - runners are : In Iowa , Romney , a former Massachusetts governor , posts a solid lead , with support from 28 % of GOP voters .
Giuliani and Thompson trail with 16 % each .
Arizona Sen . John McCain 's faltering campaign drew 7 % in the survey .
In New Hampshire , Romney tops Giuliani 28 % to 23 % , a lead that is within the poll 's margin of error .
McCain , who won the New Hampshire primary in 2000 , is backed by 12 % .
Thompson drew 11 % , showing little bounce from his splashy national campaign announcement via late - night television and webcast .
In South Carolina , where Thompson is hoping to trade on his Southern roots , the former Tennessee senator leads Giuliani 26 % to 23 % , within the poll 's margin of error .
The result is a reversal from a Times / Bloomberg survey in June , when Giuliani outpolled Thompson .
Taken together , the results underscore that voters who have had the closest view of the Republican field see the race far differently than do voters nationwide .

Newt Gingrich challenges both Congress and the President to enact " Real Change " to make things better .
Coincidentally , Real Change is also the title of his new book .
Amazing how that works .
What 's equally amazing is what Newt thinks constitutes real change :
Michigan was in a recession when the rest of the country was growing .
Other than the states hit by Katrina , Michigan which had been hit by a Democratic governor , Democratic legislature , raised taxes .
Yet none of the candidates are willing to be radical enough .
Part of what we …Real Change focuses a long section on Detroit .
Detroit has gone from a 1,800,000 people in 1950 and highest per capita income in the United States to 950,000 people and it ranks today 62nd in per capita income .
And yet nobody want to get up and say ... tell the truth .
The truth is large bureaucracies are destructive .
High taxes are destructive .
The system we built discourages any businesses from opening up in Detroit .
The schools do n’t deliver .
They uh they do deliver paychecks .
They do take care of the union , but they do n’t deliver for the kids .
And this is a time where if you ’re an African American male and you drop out of high school , you have a 73 % chance of being unemployed and a 60 % chance of going to jail .
So I think we need dramatically deeper and more fundamental change .
The prescribed change ?
Reduce spending and tax cuts .
Real revolutionary , doncha think ?
Does Newt cover the devastation to Detroit 's economy by trade agreements like NAFTA , taking manufacturing jobs out of the country ?
Nah ...it's the bureaucracies that are destructive .
He bemoans the state of education , but advocates cutting spending even further .
Is he under the impression that will help ???
However , it 's hard to argue with the premise here :
The Congress and the President , rather than say that ’s an interesting campaign , now let ’s get back to politics as usual in Washington , the Congress and the President do have a real opportunity to listen to the American people who are saying that real change does matter and the real change is what they want .
And I think it will be a pretty good contest for the two parties to say so how much can you deliver in the next three or four months , as opposed to seeing politics in Washington over here and politics in America over here .
Listening to the electorate ?
That IS revolutionary .
Amazingly , the obscure Utah - based SCO Group that sparked outrage four years ago when it began suing Linux users , is back .
The company , which sued Novell , IBM and other Linux users for infringing on its ownership rights of the Unix Operating System , has raised $ 100 million from private equity investors ( see its announcement ) , which it will use to exit bankruptcy .
SCO filed for bankruptcy protection in September , after a court ruled in August that Novell controlled the rights to the Unix Operating system — which SCO had hoped to sell to pay off creditors .
The funding came from the private equity firm Stephen Norris Capital Partners and partners in the Middle East .
The firm and its partners will have a controlling interest in SCO .
This gives SCO resources to continue its court battle with Novell over royalties from the Unix server operating system .
Silicon Valley lawyer Mark Radcliffe of DLA
Piper calls the investment “ puzzling , ” explaining why in his post here , and said that in his 25 years of practice , the SCO case represented “ one of three most dramatic failures ” of an intellectual property strategy .
The bizarre case continues .
Charities warn circumcision should not replace condoms in the war on HIV
Nearly 5,000 Ugandan men were recruited for the study .
Half were circumcised , half had yet to undergo surgery .
There was little difference between the two groups when they were asked to rate performance and satisfaction , the journal BJU International reports .
Some studies suggest circumcision can cut male HIV infection by up to 50 % .
There are several reasons why circumcision may protect against the virus .
Specific cells in the foreskin may be potential targets for HIV infection , while the skin under the foreskin may become less sensitive and less likely to bleed - reducing risk of infection - following circumcision .
Mixed picture
But despite this , it is thought there is some reluctance to be circumcised over fears that it may impact upon sexual experience .
There is a fear that people that have been circumcised will feel they are protected from HIV when they are not
Deborah Jack
National AIDS
Trust
Previous studies into circumcision and satisfaction have given a mixed picture .
But researchers from the Johns Hopkins University in the US say the size of their study and demographic profile of their participants made it one of the most reliable to date .
" Our study clearly shows that being circumcised did not have an adverse effect on the men who underwent the procedure when we compared them with the men who had not yet received surgery , " said Professor Ronald Gray , who led the study .
" Other studies already show that being able to reassure men that the procedure wo n't affect sexual satisfaction or performance makes them much more likely to be circumcised . "
Mixed armoury
While there were very slight differences in rates of sexual satisfaction between the two groups , these were not felt to be clinically significant .
Some 98.4 % of the circumcised men reported satisfaction , compared to 99.9 % in the control group .
In terms of ability to penetrate , 98.6 % of the circumcised group reported no problem , compared with 99.4 of the non-circumcised group .
However marginally more circumcised men - 99.4 % - reported that they had no pain during intercourse , compared with 98.8 % of the other group .
But campaigning charities warned against using circumcision as the main weapon against HIV , noting that it was far from 100 % effective .
Deborah Jack , chief executive of the National Aids Trust , said : " There is a fear that people that have been circumcised will feel they are protected from HIV when they are not .
" Condoms remain the best way of preventing HIV through sexual intercourse .
" It should be noted that research into HIV and circumcision has been very limited in its scope .
" We still need further research into new prevention methods from circumcision to microbicides and vaccines . "
Most concepts of MOL looked like this , but the final design of the spacecraft before the project ’s cancellation reportedly looked quite different .

All along the watchtower On Tuesday , February 12 , two television programs will focus on little known aspects of the Cold War space program .
The Discovery Science Channel is showing Tank on the Moon , about the Soviet Lunokhod rovers .
And PBS ’ Nova program is showing “ Astrospies ” , about the Air Force ’s mysterious Manned Orbiting Laboratory program , a hugely expensive watchtower in the sky that never made it very far above the ground .
The Manned Orbiting Laboratory was more popularly known as the MOL ; sources differ as to whether it was normally spoken as “ M - O - L ” or referred to as a single word , “ mole . ” MOL was started in 1963 , canceled in 1969 , and cost a hell of a lot of money in between .
It was a manned space station that would have carried two military astronauts inside a Gemini spacecraft , and a bunch of experiments , and some highly classified surveillance and reconnaissance equipment , in a cylinder behind them .
The plan was to launch a bunch of these stations over a period of several years starting in the late 1960s .
But MOL ’s story has never been fully told , and what has been told has sometimes been inaccurate and certainly woefully incomplete .
It will be interesting to see if Nova , which has produced a number of excellent space documentaries , can significantly improve our understanding of the MOL story .
Big blue - black bird MOL started in 1963 as a military space demonstration program .
Essentially the plan was to fly two military astronauts in space for at least several weeks and have them conduct multiple experiments using various military - related technology .
Initially the goal was to both test technology and to see if there was a purpose for having military astronauts in space to operate the equipment — in other words , could a human perform a military mission like spotting naval vessels or monitoring electronic signals better than a robot ?
Early experiment lists for MOL dating from 1964 and 1965 indicate a wide range of equipment to be flown and tested , including manned maneuvering units ( i.e. rocket backpacks for spacewalkers ) , large antennas , and various cameras .
Early illustrations of MOL show a long pressurized tube packed with lots of equipment and apparently oriented horizontally to the Earth , with the Gemini spacecraft at the front pointing in the direction of flight .
In fact , all of the artist impressions of MOL depict this version , and not the final version of the spacecraft .
MOL ’s story has never been fully told , and what has been told has sometimes been inaccurate and certainly woefully incomplete .
For its first year and a half MOL apparently existed in a kind of bureaucratic limbo .
It was approved by the Department of Defense , but this was insufficient to move the program forward very far , something that is difficult to understand given available records .
In August 1965 President Lyndon Johnson signed a directive approving MOL .
This probably resulted from a change in the nature of the program , most likely an expression of much - needed support from the intelligence community .
By 1965 the program was faltering .
Its proponents had quickly fallen into a classic Catch 22 : the Air Force had to prove that military astronauts were useful before they could put them in space , but they had to fly them in order to figure out that they could do something useful .
And that ’s when a major change occurred in the program , something that most people researching MOL have failed to note , or even been aware of : MOL pre-1965 was apparently significantly different than MOL afterwards , but the vast majority of available records on MOL concern the early version of the project , not what the Air Force ultimately decided to fly .
To truly understand the change , it is necessary to know something about the arcane world of the military space bureaucracy .
The Air Force had its own “ blue - suit ” space program run by the Space Systems Division and based in Los Angeles .
But there were also Air Force officers who worked for a super - secret “ black ” Department of Defense agency called the National Reconnaissance Office .
The two groups occasionally interacted , but were largely segregated , and there were blue - suiters in the Air Force space program who were completely unaware of the highly classified intelligence spacecraft that were being developed by their fellow officers who often worked down the hall in the same facilities .
Around 1965 or 1966 MOL acquired a major new sponsor , the National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) , and a massive telescope , which the NRO designated the KH - 10 DORIAN .
According to one person who saw a top secret illustration of MOL after the program was canceled , the final configuration looked a lot like the Hubble Space Telescope with a downward - pointing telescope nested in a long unpressurized tube and a pressurized cylinder atop it , crowned with a Gemini spacecraft pointing out toward the sky .
MOL ’s primary mirror was the largest space - based mirror ever produced up to that time — 183 centimeters ( 72 inches ) in diameter .
Instead of a largely experimental mission with lots of little experiments , the MOL astronauts would fly an operational mission , spending most of their time pointing the DORIAN camera at ground targets and taking high - resolution photographs .
There were a lot of skeptics about this plan .
MOL was proceeding slowly throughout the 1960s at a time when robotic spacecraft were advancing rapidly , their lifetimes and capabilities increasing substantially in the mid-1960s .
MOL had also been designed from early on to operate unmanned , raising questions as to why the humans were even necessary .
MOL cost a lot of money that many in the Air Force believed should be spent on Vietnam , by then a very high - tech war .
MOL had several major development components .
Although the Gemini B spacecraft ( not to be confused with the earlier Blue Gemini proposal ) could be purchased virtually off the shelf — albeit with a hole cut in its reentry shield for an access hatch to the main spacecraft — the MOL laboratory was new and complex .
The Titan III rocket was also a major expense , as was its new launch facility .
The government used eminent domain to seize the large Sudden Ranch to the south of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California , and began building a massive launch complex there .
Eventually the MOL program included seven development flights between 1968 and 1971 , and at least six operational flights starting in 1971 , although details remain classified .
There were nuisances to overcome as well .
A Florida senator objected to launching MOL out of California when there was already a perfectly good launch facility in his own state .
This required Department of Defense officials testifying before Congress to deftly deflect attention from the fact that they needed to launch from California in order to spy on the Soviet Union .
As one former senior Air Force official once put it , the program always seemed to be one year and one billion dollars more away from completion .
MOL was an expensive project , and by 1967 it was clashing with another space project , a massive robotic spacecraft designated the KH - 9 HEXAGON .
Whereas MOL was primarily an Air Force program with NRO involvement , HEXAGON was the reverse , an NRO program — largely managed by the CIA — with the Air Force providing some major parts , particularly the Titan III launch vehicle , which was also being modified to carry humans on the MOL .
The cameras for the two spacecraft were different and intended to do different things .
The DORIAN camera was very high resolution and could only see small parts of the Earth .
A human hand would operate the shutter , focusing on “ targets of opportunity . ”
One person responsible for training the astronauts how to recognize such targets remembers showing them a satellite photograph of a Soviet submarine that had been pulled out of the water .
The sub ’s propeller blades were clearly visible — and countable — something that was extremely rare for satellite photographs that normally only captured more mundane scenes .
The HEXAGON camera had lower resolution , but could photograph massive amounts of territory underneath , scanning vast swaths of the Soviet Union looking for changes .
The four - inch question
But the Air Force was stuck with paying the bills on two new expensive satellite projects and in 1968 this forced one of several showdowns .
Vice President Hubert Humphrey held a briefing where MOL ’s advocates were asked to make their case .
Humphrey was accompanied by Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms , whose own agency was firmly committed to building the HEXAGON .
According to one person who was present , Helms remained silent throughout the meeting while Humphrey was briefed on both the HEXAGON and the MOL .
But near the end of the MOL briefing Helms wrote something on a piece of paper and slid it over to Humphrey , who looked at it but did not say anything .
After the meeting was over , this person hung around the room until everybody left and then picked up the piece of paper .
On it , Helms had written a short question : “ Why four inches ? ” Four inches ( 10 centimeters ) happened to be the resolution of the MOL ’s DORIAN camera , and it was also a source of contention between the CIA and the Air Force .
The CIA had conducted many studies of what trained human eyeballs could see in overhead ( i.e. satellite and aerial ) photography .
They had determined at what resolution a human could distinguish a tank from an armored personnel vehicle , and at what ( better ) resolution a human could tell one kind of tank from another .
Although there was a natural drive towards better and better resolution , higher resolution came with other costs , primarily a smaller viewing area — think of the difference between looking for an airplane in the sky using a telescope versus a pair of binoculars .
The CIA had concluded that MOL ’s four - inch resolution was excessive , unnecessary , and damned expensive .
MOL did not die that day , but the program was already in serious trouble .
As one former senior Air Force official once put it , the program always seemed to be one year and one billion dollars more away from completion .
When MOL was finally canceled in summer 1969 , a lot of people were apparently stunned by the decision , and many of them lost their jobs .
One senior MOL manager was at that very moment testifying in a closed meeting in Congress about MOL ’s capabilities when he was handed a note saying that President Nixon had killed it .
He was shocked , and so were the members of Congress .
By the time it was canceled , the Air Force had spent $ 1.4 billion on MOL development and had ramped up to annual expenditures of nearly $ 500 million .
To understand the magnitude of this expenditure , consider that roughly adjusted for inflation , today that is over $ 8.5 billion in development funding and $ 3 billion in annual expenditures .
Although amateur historians — and apparently the Nova program — focus on the military astronauts , many of whom went on to later NASA careers , a lot of big questions about MOL remain unanswered .
Much of the shock over MOL ’s cancellation can probably be attributed to the security compartmentation of the program .
Although it seems likely that nearly everybody working on the MOL was aware that it was carrying a top secret piece of equipment , probably very few were aware that at least two highly classified studies of that equipment indicated that it was unlikely to work .
The studies had concluded that putting humans alongside a powerful optical instrument dramatically undercut its capabilities .
Humans bumped things , they had to exercise , and they required air that had to be moved around with fans .
All this meant vibration , and vibration is bad for finely - tuned optics that have to be precisely pointed at targets hundreds of kilometers away .
Worse , their spacecraft would outgas , and they would have to dump urine overboard , where it would interfere with the optics system .
NASA discovered this phenomenon in the 1980s , when the Space Shuttle proved to be a very dirty platform from which to conduct observations .
As one person noted years later , MOL had been living on borrowed time for several years before its “ sudden ” cancellation .
Although many in the Air Force were crushed by MOL ’s cancellation , and it spelled the beginning of the end of the Air Force ’s fascination with military man in space , others soon found the cancellation to be a windfall .
MOL was sucking up a lot of money in the Air Force ’s research and development budget , and suddenly dozens of other projects that had been struggling for funding , like precision - guided bombs for Vietnam , received a big influx of money .
Watchtower still hidden in the shadows Today relatively little is known about the MOL program other than its overall outlines .
Although amateur historians — and apparently the Nova program — focus on the military astronauts , many of whom went on to later NASA careers , a lot of big questions about MOL remain unanswered .
What was its real purpose ?
Who established its requirements ?
What was its schedule and how many MOLs did the Air Force plan to build ?
What was the story behind its delays and cost overruns ?
Who were its proponents and its opponents ?
Why did the NRO leadership agree to become involved in a human spaceflight program after apparently deciding in the early 1960s that they wanted no part of human spaceflight ?
And how were responsibilities divided between the Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office bureaucracy ?
Did the CIA openly fight MOL ?
Also unknown are many technical questions .
Did the Air Force recognize the requirement for astronaut exercise for long - duration spaceflight and how did they accommodate it ?
How would the astronauts coordinate their eating , sleeping , maintenance , and exercise schedules with the need to peer through the telescope every time they flew over the Soviet Union ?
What did MOL actually look like on the inside ?
How did it obtain power and point itself ?
What kinds of equipment would it carry and how ?
And how would it return its film back to the ground — via the cramped Gemini or , more likely , with ejectable reentry vehicles ?
And how much actual test and flight hardware was actually built and what happened to it all ?
Those questions cannot be answered as long as the program remains classified .
MOL ’s launch site at Vandenberg was completed with some additional funds after the cancellation of the program , and then placed in mothballs .
Eventually the launch site was converted for the Space Shuttle , but then shut down and mothballed again in the 1980s .
Only recently has it been pressed into service for what it was originally intended , launching big rockets .
The Titan III , of course , was used to launch numerous other payloads into space , but it was already underway by the 1960s and it is difficult to determine how much credit to give the MOL program for improving the Titan III .
It also appears that , rumors to the contrary , much of MOL ’s technology was never incorporated into follow - on programs .
Several big mirrors for MOL ’s DORIAN telescope were manufactured , but they were eventually donated to the University of Arizona ’s Multi-Mirror Telescope Observatory .
One former industry official recounted how he was told to pitch a camera developed for MOL to NASA ’s Skylab program , something for which it was terribly unsuited .
A few minutes into the meeting he halted the pitch and told the surprised , and grateful , NASA official that they were wasting his time , infuriating the man ’s boss and convincing both of them that the man did not really belong in industry if he was not willing to try to sell products to people who did not want them .
One of the ironies ( or hypocrisies ) of the whole event was that only a few years after MOL ’s cancellation the CIA began working on a satellite known as the KH - 11 KENNAN which used a 240 - centimeter ( 94.5 - inch ) mirror to provide 7.5 - centimeter ( 3 - inch ) ground resolution , something that the agency had claimed was unnecessary when the Air Force wanted to do it .
Why the NRO refuses to even acknowledge MOL at a time when it at least vaguely acknowledges involvement in programs that followed it , like the KH - 11 , remains unknown .
Thousands of documents on MOL ’s early years have been declassified , although little - used by historians .
They only cover the years before the MOL took a sudden new direction , leaving essentially half of MOL ’s history concealed in darkness .
An official history of the program remains highly classified .
In response to a Freedom of Information Act request , the NRO adopted the “ Glomar response ” ( named after the CIA ’s Glomar Explorer ship used to recover portions of a Soviet submarine ) refusing to acknowledge that it may have records indicating an association with the MOL , even though there is significant declassified documentation demonstrating that MOL was intended to conduct NRO missions .
Why the NRO refuses to even acknowledge MOL at a time when it at least vaguely acknowledges involvement in programs that followed it , like the KH - 11 , remains unknown .
However , American secrecy policy encompasses many decisions that appear inexplicable and contradictory to outsiders , and probably little better to those who actually know why they were made .
Hopefully , the Nova documentary can shed some new light on these issues , but given the secrecy cloak that has been thrown over the program , there are good reasons to be skeptical .

“ You do n’t mind making a $ 2,000 payment when the house is going up ” in value , said Steve Walsh , a mortgage broker in Scottsdale , Arizona , who has seen several clients walk away from their homes because they could n’t refinance or sell .
“ When it ’s going down , it becomes a weight around your neck , it becomes an anchor . ”
Home prices in the North Las Vegas neighborhood of Brenda Harris , a technology analyst at a casino company , have fallen 20 percent to 30 percent .
The builder who sold her a new three - bedroom home on Pink Flamingos Place for about $ 392,000 in 2006 is now listing similar properties for $ 314,000 .
A larger house a block down from Ms. Harris was recently listed online for $ 310,000 .
But Ms. Harris does not want to leave her home .
She estimates that she has spent close to $ 40,000 on her property , about half for a down payment and much of the rest on a deck and landscaping .
“ I ’m not behind in my payments , but I ’m trying to prevent getting behind , ” Ms. Harris said .
“ I do n’t want to ruin my credit . ”
In addition to the declining value of her home , Ms. Harris , 53 , will soon be hit with a sharply higher house payment .
She has an option adjustable - rate mortgage , a loan that allows borrowers to pay less than the interest and principal due every month .
The unpaid interest gets added to the principal balance .
She is making the minimum monthly payments due on her loan , about $ 2,400 .
But she knows she will not be able to pay the $ 3,400 needed to cover her interest and principal , which she will be required to pay once her loan balance reaches 115 percent of her starting balance .
And under the terms of her loan , which was made by Countrywide Financial , she would have to pay a prepayment penalty of about $ 40,000 if she chose to refinance or sell her home before May 2009 .
She said that she now wishes she had taken a traditional fixed - rate loan when she bought the home .
At the time , she asked for a loan that could be refinanced after one year without penalty .
She said her broker had told her a week before the closing that the penalty would extend until May 2009 and that she reluctantly agreed because she had already started moving .

Remember how White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told us in April that she “ would n’t rule out ” that the Bush administration may have lost 5 million emails ?
You know , the emails the White House does n’t want you to see ?
No ?
Here ’s your update :
The Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) and the National Security Archive ( NSA ) noticed the administration ’s “ technical issue , ” and they sued to find out how and if the White House plans to recover them .
The White House , which is nothing if not predictable , has of course refused to answer any questions about the “ lost ” emails , which could contain information on everything from Valerie Plame to the U.S. Attorneys scandal to Hurricane Katrina .
But a court order ( PDF ) issued Tuesday by D.C. District Court Judge John Facciola gives the administration five business days to answer four questions about whether and how the emails are backed - up .
These are the questions the plaintiffs needed a court order to get the White House to answer ( I am not making this up ) :
1 . Are the back - ups catalogued , labeled or otherwise identified to indicate the period of time they cover ?
2 . Are the back - ups catalogued , labeled or otherwise identified to indicate the data contained therein ?
3 . Do the back - ups contain emails written and received between 2003 - 2005 ?
4 . Do the back - ups contain the emails said to be missing that are the subject of this lawsuit ?
To make this perfectly clear : the plaintiffs are still trying to find out whether the White House even has the emails .
Meredith Fuchs , the NSA ’s General Counsel , told me she ’s doubtful that , even faced with a court order , the White House will provide full answers to their questions .
“ I hope that we ’re going to learn something about what emails still exist and are recoverable , but I worry that they will continue to evade answering the questions , ” she says .
That seems fairly likely , since evasion works to the White House ’s benefit .
If the backup tapes do not in fact contain the missing emails ( Question 4 ) , then every day that goes by means the emails are less recoverable .
If they were n’t backed - up , the emails would have to be dredged up from the depths of computer memory on individual workstations and servers or through other , unnamed “ forensic means . ”
And as anyone who has ever deleted an important file and tried to recover it knows , the more you use a computer after losing a file , the harder it is to recover .
According to the court order , “ [ E ] mails that might now be retrievable from email account folders or ‘ slack space ’ on individual workstations are increasingly likely to be deleted or overwritten with the passage of time . ”
So if the White House is trying to keep damaging emails from prying eyes , the more it delays , the less likely it is that anyone will ever see them .
Judge Facciola appears to recognize that time is of the essence .
Thus the court order .
But Anne Weismann , CREW ’s Chief Counsel , says that the White House has lots of ways to buy more time .
If the White House gives incomplete or vague answers to questions that Weismann characterized as “ pretty straightforward , ” “ not burdensome , ” and “ discrete ” the plaintiffs would have to push the court to find the White House did not sufficiently answer the questions .
“ If we have to go down that road it uses up time and that really seems to be the goal on the administration ’s side — to use up the clock .
Judge Facciola recognized that time is running out , but it ’s very sad that we ’re talking about the possibility that the White House may not comply with a court order .
How have we gotten to that point ? ”
Both the House Judiciary Committee and House Oversight Committee have taken an interest in the missing emails , but CREW and the NSA would like to see Congress do more .
Weismann said her group is doing its best , but Congress is simply better - positioned to hold the administration to account for its record - keeping failings .
Weismann said that Congress could subpoena documents that might break the story wide open .
“ There were documents created that reflect all this information , ” she said .
According to Weismann , when the missing email problem was first discovered , the federal Office of Administration developed an action plan to recover the missing data from backup tapes .
But Weismann said that she ’s been told the plan was never implemented .
CREW used a Freedom of Information request to try to obtain the documents relating to the plan , but the administration has so far refused to release the documents .
“ It does seem that Congress has some tools that they could more effectively use , like subpoenas , ” Weismann said .
“ It would be a first step in the evidentiary proof that this White House has blatantly disregarded its record keeping obligations .
That might be something that Congress might want to get and they might have more success than we ’ve had so far . ”
( The House Oversight Committee has not yet returned a call seeking comment . )
The next step for the plaintiffs depends on how the White House responds .
If it turns out that the emails are on backup tapes , then CREW and the NSA will ask the judge to ask the National Archivist to ask the Attorney General to force the White House to have them restored .
If the Attorney General then does nothing , they could ask Congress to force the issue .
The plaintiffs will also ask the judge to force the White House to install an appropriate record - keeping system so similar problems wo n’t happen again .
If the emails are not on the backup tapes , that could lead to an even bigger legal standoff .
“ If they deleted the backups knowing that they were the only remaining copies of these missing emails , that raises all sorts of questions about criminal misconduct , ” Weismann said .
But criminal misconduct aside , the plaintiffs would then pursue obtaining the emails from other sources , like individual computers and email accounts .
It ’s unclear whether the court would permit that .
In the middle - to - long - term , CREW and the NSA would also like to see Congress amend the Presidential Records Act .
As currently interpreted by the courts , the act does not give groups like the NSA cause of action to sue to force the White House to obey record keeping laws .
Neither does current law give the National Archivist jurisdiction to monitor presidential record - keeping , as it does for federal records .
So the current lawsuit is entirely under the auspices of the Federal Records Act .
Interestingly , the NSA and CREW were only able to bring their lawsuit because of the Bush administration ’s haphazard record keeping .
It ’s only proceeding because the Bush administration does n’t have a system that divides presidential and federal records .
( Presidential records are produced by bodies like the National Security Council that simply advise the president .
Federal records are produced by bodies that have functions beyond giving advice , They are governed by a different statute . )
The Clinton administration had a system that sorted emails automatically and stored them in a secure , searchable archive , but the Bush administration discarded that system when it came into office .
As far as anyone outside the White House knows , that system was never replaced , so federal and presidential records were commingled .
( The Clinton system was n’t perfect — some of the Vice - President ’s records went missing , which led to a mini-scandal and a report from the Government Accountability Office that stressed the importance of good record keeping . )
So when 5 million ( or as many as 10 million , according to Weismann ) emails went missing , they included many federal records .
That is what made it possible for NSA and CREW to bring their suit .
If the Bush administration had kept the two types of records separate , and the only missing emails were presidential records , the plaintiffs suit would probably have been dismissed out of hand .
But it remains to be seen whether this story will get the coverage it deserves .
Anne Weismann told me she worries the issues involved are too complex .
“ Ultimately , the story is a huge scandal , but in order to get there the public has to understand a lot of technical and legal things , and I think the White House has been lucky that this has n’t taken off yet in the way it should because it ’s complicated . ”
That ’s too bad .
After news of the tainted wheat gluten emerged last spring , all of the companies charged in the indictment said they did not know how melamine  which can be toxic when ingested  had made its way into the gluten .
But the owner of Xuzhou Anying , Mao Lijun  who is referred to in the indictment as Mao Linzhun  subsequently conceded to Chinese authorities that his company had added the melamine to make the wheat gluten appear higher in protein , court papers said .
Xuzhou was required by ChemNutra to produce wheat gluten with at least 75 percent protein content .
Melamine is used in many industrial products like glues , inks and fertilizers , but it has no approved uses in food in the United States .
The F.D.A. found the melamine in the wheat gluten in late March and determined that it had been used in the wheat gluten that Xuzhou Anying shipped from November 2006 to February 2007 .
Xuzhou Anying shipped at least 13 loads of the tainted wheat gluten , more than 800 metric tons , through Suzhou Textiles , which created false labels for the shipments , the indictment said .
China ’s product safety agency requires that shipments of wheat gluten be inspected before export .
To avoid inspection , Suzhou Textiles labeled the shipments with a code other than the one that would have indicated it was wheat gluten , according to the indictment .
ChemNutra and its owners , a married couple , Sally Qing Miller and Stephen S. Miller , knew that the shipment was mislabeled in a way that would allow it to leave China without testing , the United States attorney ’s office says , and the Millers did not disclose the mislabeling to pet food makers .
The government cited e-mail messages sent or received by the Millers in 2006 in which the proper codes for wheat gluten and other proteins were discussed .
Although 18,000 voters in Sarasota , Florida understand that software - driven voting machinery cannot be trusted , the presidential candidates do n't seem to understand that voting technology has reached a level of unreliability that calls for an upgrade to paper and pencil .
After spending billions of dollars on electronic voting machines around the country , the candidates are now faced with a faith - based system .
While recent studies in California and Colorado confirm the security limitations of software - driven equipment and a growing body of academic research warns of dangers of election fraud by hackers the candidates go about their business trying to win votes that might never be counted .
Software designers and vendors rush to install " patches " and " upgrades " as they pile on increasing cost and complexity to voting machines .
Lost votes , flipped votes , blank screens , freeze - ups and other " glitches " are becoming common - place events in America 's elections while the candidates look the other way .
Instead of making the voting machines more secure , the increasing complexity simply introduces more attack points for political hackers bent on altering election outcomes .
The " best evidence " rule of law no longer applies to electoral disputes and the public is left to trust the machines and the last person with access to the machine memory .
Election fraud , with today 's technology , is now possible on a grand scale without detection thanks to self - deleting malicious software code .
As touch - screen voting machines lose some favor the software - driven optical scanners gain ground , yet both types of machines are subject to hacking and manipulation without detection .
Presidential candidates have much to lose with rigged voting machines and yet the silence about this homeland security threat is deafening .
In their efforts to not be seen as having kooky ideas or being outside the mainstream the candidates have imposed a self - censorship on a topic very important to their own candidacy , the honest counting of votes .
There is a ready - made solution to the software threat , hand counting of paper ballots .
However , three things stand in the way of hand counting : money , speed , and history .
Money is a barrier to honest elections because of the billions already spent on new voting machines .
However , throwing more money at the problem of voting security will only result in more money being wasted .
Hand counting keeps election administration funds in local communities instead of enriching some corporation or team of computer consultants .
Speed is a barrier to honest elections because of the media frenzy to count the votes instantly and report the results before the returns are in .
The mad rush to know the outcome of an election immediately dooms the results of the election for an honest count in this day and age of hackers .
Take the time to count the ballots and get it right .
History is a barrier to honest elections because hand counting can be rigged , and has been in the past .
However , this is a problem that can be fixed simply by allowing public observation of the count .
Public observation of hand counting paper ballots in the precinct is the most secure form of vote tabulation there is .
Public observed hand counting is the gold standard for an honest election .
It requires no expensive technology , cannot be rigged by a hacker , and would increase citizen interest and participation in the electoral process .
Why are n't the presidential candidates speaking up ?
Why are n't the candidates demanding an honest count ?
American voters deserve better than what we are getting .
Demand hand counted ballots with public observation ; it is our only safeguard for our form of government .
We need to vote in secret but count in public .

A Defense Department contract involving antidrug training missions may test the durability of the political controversy over Blackwater Worldwide 's security work in Iraq .
The Moyock , N.C. , company , which was involved in a September shooting in Baghdad that left 17 Iraqis dead , is one of five military contractors competing for as much as $ 15 billion over five years to help fight a narcotics trade that the government says finances terrorist groups .
Also competing for contracts from the Pentagon 's Counter Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office are military - industry giants Raytheon Co. , Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. , as well as Arinc Inc. , a smaller aerospace and technology contractor .
The contracts are expected to be awarded as the need arises , so the Pentagon 's level of concern about employing Blackwater will likely be measured over time and by whether the company wins leading roles or is shut out .
Companies competing for the work might be called on to develop detection or surveillance technology ; train U.S. and foreign forces ; or provide logistics , communications and information - technology systems , among other areas .
The prevailing view among SaaS evangelists seems to be that if it ’s hosted and charged for on a price per user per month basis , or better still free , then it must be good .
This is a religious standpoint that is no more useful or valid than oft - heard claims that open source software is universally better than the commercial equivalent .
At the end of the day , it is fitness for purpose and the balance between cost , risk and value that matters for mainstream business use , and there is good and bad in all camps .
When I challenged some of the purist SaaS thinking in a blog post recently ( see Dissecting SaaS ) , I got a lot of phone calls and emails from SaaS providers offering to ‘ educate ’ me on how their particular service was as an example of why the SaaS delivery model was so compelling .
After listening to a few of these stories , I was still singularly unimpressed with most of what I heard – essentially far too much ‘ me too ’ reinventions of traditional applications that typically did less than the solutions they were supposed to be replacing .
Despite all the hype , I do n’t seem to be alone in my unwillingness to blindly accept everything SaaS as representing the future of IT .
Reg readers too seem to have a healthy degree of scepticism for a lot of the SaaS - related noise we are hearing .
The recent Tech Barometer survey , for instance , placed SaaS right at the bottom of the list of IT - related priorities .
So am I saying it ’s all rubbish ?
Not at all .
My own company does n’t own or run any servers , for example , and relies completely on two SaaS providers , Incontech and Cobweb , for collaboration and email services respectively .
What both of these organisations have in common , though , is that services are founded on mainstream technology – they are not reinventing any wheels for the sake of it .
The proposition is one of removing the need for capital investment coupled with a promise to take away the challenges and distractions of managing and supporting systems .
From a comfort perspective , the underlying use of mainstream applications means we are not locked in – we can switch providers or bring our systems in - house relatively easily if we need to for any reason .
The trouble with many of the SaaS start - ups , though , is that the foundation for their service is a home - grown application .
The old argument to justify this is that applications designed and built from the ground up for so - called ‘ multi- tenancy ’ deployment enable a superior service to be delivered .
Pretty much all established software vendors now have this as a design requirement , however , so a SaaS friendly architecture is no longer significant differentiator .
The second argument , that home - grown service provider applications avoid subscription fees being inflated by the cost of commercial software licences , is still a valid one , but the flip side of this is that options for the subscriber to later bring the application back in - house or switch providers can be severely restricted .
To put it another way , there is a significant risk of lock - in so you had better be sure of not just the provider , but the incremental value you are going to get from the service compared to other offerings – whether SaaS or traditional on - premise in nature .
Interestingly , if you look at service provider authored SaaS applications in this way , i.e. by asking what new they bring to the party in terms of capability , then the SaaS delivery element sometimes becomes a bit of red herring .
Will offerings like FreeAgent , for example , be successful because they are SaaS - based or because they fill a gap ?
– in this case the need for ‘ cut the crap ’ accounting , billing and tax management designed for IT contractors and the like that are not well served by traditional players like Sage .
The significance of SaaS here is mostly to do with allowing start - ups to come to market quickly without having to worry about physical software distribution – but it is precisely because such barriers have come down that we need to look at the quality and completeness of the functionality on offer before we sign up for stuff .
The reality is that we will continue to be faced with a stream of incomplete , mediocre and even quite poor offerings , as well as the good ones , and I for one am very wary of the ‘ perpetual beta ’
Web 2.0 philosophy when it comes to solutions I need to run my business .
Looking forward though , the purist and evangelistic view of SaaS will gradually fade away over time .
The future lies in open software architectures that can operate effectively across company boundaries , which is basically a fancy way of saying that we are heading towards a world in which it will be easy to plug external services into internal systems to achieve the optimum mix for the particular requirement at hand .
That ’s why I like companies offering services that complement on - premise solutions .
One of the cleanest examples of this I have come across recently is Mimecast , which provides a bunch of services such as security and archiving that essentially plug into your in - house email infrastructure over the wire , without asking you to shift the whole kit and caboodle into ‘ the cloud ’ .
To net all this out , the trick is not to get sucked into all of the hype .
In one form or another , software functionality delivered over the wire as a service will find its way into most businesses over time , but SaaS is not in itself some kind of magic bullet .
It ’s simply another option for potentially meeting business requirements that is appropriate in some cases , but not in others . ®
Die ersten Berichte von der Wahlbeobachtung in Hessen trudeln ein , und es ist erschreckend .
In Obertshausen wurden interessierte Buerger vor dem Wahllokal , in dem sie den Aufbau der Wahlcomputer beobachten wollten , abgefangen , das Betreten des Wahllokals verweigert , ihre Personalien festgestellt , eine Anzeige wegen Stoerung der Wahl angekuendigt und der Hinweis auf die Paragraphen im Wahlgesetz zur Oeffentlichkeit der Wahl mit dem Spruch “ Sie haben hier gar keine Rechte ! ” beantwortet .
Dann wurden sie des Bannkreises um das Wahllokal verwiesen und von einem Ordnungsamtsmitarbeiter mit dem Auto bis zur Landkreisgrenze verfolgt .
In einem anderen Wahllokal wurde bei Eroeffnung der Wahl festgestellt , dass der Computer kaputt ist .
Es dauerte etwa eine Stunde bis ein Ersatzgeraet vor Ort war .
Waehrenddessen wurden die Waehler abgewiesen bzw .
auf eine obskure Briefwahlprozedur am Rathaus verwiesen .
Da etliche der Fruehwaehler Schichtarbeiter mit knappem Zeitplan sind , wurde ihnen damit effektiv das Wahlrecht genommen .
In einem weiteren Wahllokal stellte sich herraus , dass der Wahlcomputer aus praktischen Gruenden bei einem Parteifunktionaer zu Hause uebernachtet hat .
Und dann wollen sie uns immer Erzaehlen , das Innentaeter - Szenario sei total theoretisch und unwahrscheinlich …
Allgemein wurde festgestellt , dass die Wahlvorstaende und - helfer nicht selten massiv mit der Inbetriebnahme ueberfordert waren .
Die vorgeschriebenen Prozeduren zur Siegelpruefung etc. wurden oft erst nach Hinweis der Wahlbeobachter durchgefuehrt .
In Langen hat der Wahlleiter per Rundschreiben alle Wahlvorstaende vor dem Chaos Computer Club gewarnt und die Benutzung von Fotoapparaten , Telefonen und Computern im Wahllokal untersagt .
Das sich bisher abzeichnende Bild ist schlimmer als erwartet .
Wir waren eigentlich davon ausgegangen , dass , nach der Aufmerksamkeit im Vorfeld , alle Beteiligten peinlich darauf achten alles richtig zu machen und das auch zu demonstrieren .
So wie es aussieht wird die Liste der Gruende fuer die Wahleinsprueche eher laenglich …
Update : Die erste Zusammenfassung der Beobachtungen ist jetzt beim CCC als Pressemeldung online .
Da kommt auf jeden Fall noch mehr nach .
Dank der wirklich großen Zahl an Wahlbeobachtern wird das Zusammentragen aller Gedächtnisprotokolle , Fotos etc. ein paar Tage dauern .
Falls aus den betroffenen Gemeinden noch jemand Einspruch gegen die Wahl erheben will , bitte melden , Gründe gibt es nun echt genug .
FROM his grand top - floor office in Berkeley Square , Lakshmi Mittal commands a westward view over London 's West End to Kensington Gardens , where he lives in one of the city 's swankiest houses .
The giant swimming pool in its basement is one reason why the leader of the world 's steel industry , and Britain 's richest man , looks so fit and relaxed .
Born in India , Mr Mittal has long made London his home and first came to notice there in 2002 when Tony Blair , the prime minister at the time , controversially put in a good word for him in a Romanian deal .
When he made his sudden and spectacular appearance on the European business scene in early 2006 , Mr Mittal was still a relative unknown .
French government ministers , frightened by his takeover bid for the largely French Arcelor steel firm , did not know whether they were under attack from America or India .
The answer was neither : Mittal Steel was a company from everywhere and nowhere , which helps to explain why its integration with Arcelor to form ArcelorMittal , the world 's largest steelmaker , went so surprisingly smoothly .
Most mergers fail : from AOL Time Warner to DaimlerChrysler , the corporate landscape of the past decade is littered with wrecks .
Just as surprising was the way in which Mr Mittal managed to overcome opposition to the deal from the business establishment and the French government — and has now gone on to increase profits in the new firm 's first full year .
On February 13th ArcelorMittal announced that it had made $ 19.4 billion , before tax and interest , on sales of $ 105 billion in 2007 — up 27 % on the two firms ' aggregated profits in the previous year .
Mr Mittal 's 43 % stake makes him the world 's fifth - richest man , with a fortune of some £ 19 billion .
It helps , of course , that Mittal Steel made its move on Arcelor — a European champion forged in 2001 — just as steel prices were heading for record levels , driven by Chinese demand .
Mr Mittal was not the only one thinking of global consolidation in late 2005 .
Arcelor was fighting with ThyssenKrupp of Germany over Canada 's Dofasco .
Corus , the firm formed by the union of British Steel with a Dutch firm , Hoogovens , was looking for a strategic buyer , and ended up choosing India 's Tata over Brazil 's CSN .
And Mittal Steel itself ( then 88 % owned by the Mittal family ) had just bought International Steel , a collection of bombed - out American mills , overtaking Arcelor in the process to become the industry 's number one .
So Mr Mittal was already leading the race to consolidate the industry at the time of the Arcelor deal , which confirmed him as the winner with the creation of a new giant that accounts for one - tenth of world steel output .
The ArcelorMittal merger went so smoothly , Mr Mittal explains , because the two companies had been formed as a result of some 50 smaller mergers between them .
Having survived all these previous deals , the firms ' managers were not afraid of change .
Arcelor was the fusion of Arbed in Luxembourg , Usinor in France and Aceralia in Spain .
The origins of the Mittal steel empire were less obvious .
The Mittal family had a steel business in their native India , but felt expansion was constricted by regulation and the presence of both a state - owned rival , SAIL , and a private national champion , Tata Steel .
So Mr Mittal 's father helped him start a steel mill from scratch in Indonesia in 1975 .
The trick he learned there was to move into steelmaking using imported direct - reduced iron ( DRI ) pellets instead of more expensive scrap or imported steel billets .
The younger Mittal 's emergence onto the world steel scene was not part of some global vision , but was the result of opportunism , a bold eye for a deal and an ability to turn round failing firms .
His supplier of DRI was a struggling state - owned steel firm in Trinidad .
When the Trinidadians spotted Mr Mittal 's success in Indonesia , they invited him to turn their firm around under contract , and he eventually bought it in 1994 .
At around the same time he acquired another DRI steel plant in Mexico , and two more in Canada and Germany .
All of these were distressed assets that governments wanted to offload .
By the end of the 1990s the brash newcomer from Kolkata by way of Jakarta was even picking up assets in America , where the rust - belt steel firms were going into decline , and in Eastern Europe , where governments were keen to privatise loss - making state - owned firms .
Today Mr Mittal 's firm owns one Chinese steel company and holds a stake in another .
The steel giant thus straddles the developing world ( with opportunities for growth ) and the developed world ( with scope for consolidation ) .
Boldness be my friend
Last summer ArcelorMittal launched its new corporate identity with a lavish party at the Musée Rodin in Paris .
The company 's motto ( “ Boldness changes everything ” ) is no empty boast , but a neat reflection of the way Mr Mittal 's dealmaking created a world - leading steel giant from virtually nothing in barely a dozen years .
People expect that sort of thing in Silicon Valley — but not in mature industries like steel .
Can ArcelorMittal continue to grow and thrive ?
One potential threat comes from the consolidation of iron - ore suppliers : if BHP Billiton succeeds in its bid for Rio Tinto , the combined firm would have over one - third of the freely traded market .
But Mr Mittal already has in - house ore supplies to cover half his needs and expects this to grow to three - quarters in a few years .
Another challenge will be to carry out rationalisation in Europe in the face of political opposition .
After a summons from President Nicolas Sarkozy , Mr Mittal has agreed to review plans to close a plant in north - east France .
But perhaps the biggest test of all will be to cope with the emergence of China as a steel exporter .
Its steelmakers may be protected and inefficient now , but sooner or later rationalisation and greater technical skill will produce big firms that can make cheap steel .
China 's rapid development , hitherto a huge boon for Mr Mittal , may yet turn into a threat .
ANKARA ( Reuters ) - Thousands of Turkish troops have crossed into northern Iraq to hunt Kurdish rebels , television and a military source said on Friday , escalating a conflict that could undermine stability in the region .
Turkey ’s military said the cross - border offensive , possibly the largest in a decade , would continue until they had stopped the threat from PKK rebels , who have been using northern Iraq as a base to stage attacks in Turkey .
It said in a statement 24 PKK rebels and five soldiers were killed in clashes in Iraq .
It also said at least 20 rebels were killed in separate aerial attacks .
The United States urged Turkey , a key regional ally , to limit its offensive to precise PKK targets and to bring the operation to a swift conclusion .
Iraq ’s government called on Turkey to respect its sovereignty and to avoid any military action which would threaten security .
The European Union and the United Nations also urged restraint , fearing the offensive could jeopardize the most stable region in Iraq at a time when security is improving , and also rekindle tensions between Turks and ethnic Kurds .
The Turkish military said its troops had entered Iraq late on Thursday to destroy PKK camps and hunt rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , which has been battling for decades to create a Kurdish homeland in southeast Turkey .
“ The operations inside Iraq will intensify tomorrow , ” said a Turkish military source , who declined to be named .
Turkish television said between 3,000 and 10,000 soldiers had entered Iraq , but several Iraqi officials and a military source with U.S. - led coalition forces in Baghdad said only a few hundred troops were involved .
The senior Turkish military source said two brigades made up of around 8,000 troops had taken part in the offensive .
“ The Turkish Armed Forces , which attach great importance to Iraq ’s territorial integrity and stability , will return home in the shortest time possible after its goals have been achieved , ” the Turkish General Staff said in a statement .
It did give the size or length of the surprise operation , given the poor weather conditions .
PRESSURE
Turkey ’s government and military have come under domestic pressure to crush the PKK after a series of deadly attacks on their troops late last year .

Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since it began its armed struggle in 1984 .
Washington and the EU , like Turkey , classify the PKK as a terrorist organization .
Turkey says it has the right under international law to hit the PKK in Iraq .
Turkey says some 3,000 rebels are based there .
Turkey ’s military has been bombing PKK positions in northern Iraq since securing parliament ’s authorization to carry out cross - border operations in October .

“ I sincerely believe that this operation will contribute to Iraq ’s stability and peace in the region , ” Turkish President Abdullah Gul said in a statement on Friday .
Turkey appeared to be seeking to deal the PKK a crushing blow before weather conditions improve and rebels are more easily able to cross the mountains back into Turkish territory .
The Iraqi Red Crescent ( IRC ) said four bridges had been destroyed and 11 families , fewer than 100 people , had been displaced from two villages about 1 - 2 km ( 0.6 - 1.2 miles ) inside the border .
“ The civilians are scared because they do n’t know how far the Turkish army is going to enter into Iraq , ” IRC President Said Hakki told Reuters .
The central Baghdad government , which has little sway over mainly Kurdish northern Iraq , has repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution to the PKK presence .
Referring to what he said were Turkish forces targeting a number of bridges , Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told Al Arabiya television : “ ... it is not Turkey ’s right to create instability and hit targets other than the PKK .
This is what makes the situation dangerous ... and we fear military errors that may have harmful consequences for all sides . ”
Turkey launched several major land offensives in the 1990s into northern Iraq against the separatist movement and has since kept small contingents of troops at several bases there .
“ Militarily , even 50,000 troops in the 1990s were not able to destroy the PKK , but psychologically this operation could be quite effective .
It has taken the PKK by surprise , ” said Gareth Jenkins , an Istanbul - based expert on Turkish security issues .
Avis thinks they ’ve rented me a car .
Sure , on the outside it looks like a standard - fare , late - model Pontiac Grand Am .
But in actuality , it ’s my very own personal rolling WiFi hot spot : no wires , no weird antennas , no voodoo witchcraft .
As long as I ’m within 100 feet of this candy - apple - red vehicle , connecting and surfing the net is easier than drifting into a power slide on wet pavement .
The device that transforms this humdrum domestic into a shining example of go - anywhere , do - anything internet is the Autonet Mobile WiFi router .
Currently available only through Avis for $ 11 per day , the paperback - sized gadget plugs directly into an AC power adapter .
Once a security ID number is punched in , the router blazes to life and delivers encrypted WiFi within a 100 - foot radius .
Suddenly , actions unheard of in an automobile are possible : surfing the internet , syncing GPS or just looking for directions on an iPhone .
Once behind the wheel of the Pontiac , I plug the Autonet into the cigarette lighter and within seconds ( seconds , not minutes ) my PC picks up a full WiFi signal .
In a blink I ’m checking gmail , and not long after that I download directions to my hotel .
Then I look at my watch .
The entire process , from initial plug - in to receiving route info , is done in under a minute .
I ca n’t match this performance – even with my iPhone .
But the best part ?
Well , I have n’t even arrived at the best part yet .
The sweetest bonus that the little black box has in store for me occurs when I roll into my hotel .
What ?
Ten bucks a day for internet service ?
I do n’t think so .
I head to my room , unpack the router and , using the supplied AC power cord , turn my boudoir into a firewalled hot spot voluptuary .
But how is true mobile WiFi possible ?
Autonet has made it happen through a unique wireless internet service that interfaces with preexisting 3 - G and 2.5 - G ( EVDO , 1xRTT ) cellular data networks that cover 95 percent of the United States .
High - speed access ranges from 600 to 800 Kbps while integrated WEP encryption , MAC address restriction and WAN port restriction offers Zen-inducing amounts of security .
True , it ’s not as fast as a direct cable or DSL connection but the company ’s proprietary technology works transparently while a car is in motion , seamlessly stitching together signals from one cell tower to the next .
And because of this tower - to - tower hand - off feature , Autonet is able to stomp all over its main competitor : broadband wireless cards .
Even the best Sprint EVDO card is incapable of jumping on Verizon ’s network if it ca n’t find a signal .
But that ’s not a problem for Autonet .
As a result of nondenominational network agreements ( with both Sprint and Verizon ) the router will simply connect to the tower with the strongest EVDO broadband signal , regardless of carrier .
Oh yeah , the other big problem with broadband cards ?
No sharing allowed !
You can only connect one laptop to the net at a time .
Not so with the Autonet , which leverages the high - speed cellular service as a router that can be easily tapped into by multiple users .
Is n’t sharing awesome ?
Autonet Mobile CEO Sterling Pratz sure thinks so .
He envisions a world where individual hot spots are as common as cellphones and also serve to revolutionize the way we perceive mobile entertainment : " Autonet Mobile is focused on the personal hot spot as an in - car entertainment solution , replacing in - car DVD systems that lets five to six users simultaneously access the net from any WiFi enabled device – including iPhones . "
Starting next month , Pratz ’s vision will take its next step when Autonet hardware and services is offered at Toyota dealerships in Northern California .
Not long after that , other ( unnamed ) car brands and dealerships will begin to offer Autonet Mobile .
To make in - car WiFi entertainment work , Autonet devices include localized flash memory storage .
Alrighty , so how much memory , Sterling ?
" We do n’t have a defined number in terms of capacity , " Pratz says .
" We expect a range of holding between five to ten movies or flash games , music , TV shows and so on . ”
Service plans for Autonet Mobile installs are expected to be roughly $ 80 to $ 100 per month for unlimited service .
Sound a bit steep ?
Yes .
But also remember current mobile broadband services cost about the same – and lock you into contracts and carriers .
It may be that 2008 will be remembered as the year of the portable personal hot spot .
Screw Starbucks .
You wo n’t need to loiter in hotel lobbies like some sort of WiFi addicted hobo , squandering for a few kernels of data .
No , because of pioneers like Autonet , you may just be able to get online wherever you want , anytime you want , regardless of whether the carriers like it or not .

The boat is now in free water after more than 500 days
Enlarge Image
Tara sailed into the pack -ice in September 2006 and has been allowed to drift with the ocean currents and wind .
The two - masted manned vessel is crammed full of sensors to monitor the ocean , atmosphere and ice .
The ice - strengthened boat is now making its way to the island of Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean .
" We are heading north in open water , " wrote crew member Vincent Hilaire in the ship 's log , which is published online .
" The battle with the ice ... is over . "
Slow progress
Tara is a privately owned polar schooner that was loaned to the European research community for the duration of the expedition .
It is a key part of Damocles ( Developing Arctic Modelling and Observing Capabilities for Long- term Environmental Studies ) , a European - led effort to gather new information on the changing Arctic .
TARA ARCTIC DRIFT EXPEDITION
The 36 m , 130 - tonne boat was in the ice for 504 days
The schooner provides habitation for about 10 people Scientists deployed and monitored a number of instruments Experiments study air , ice and ocean behaviour
Last year , Tara measurements revealed the dramatic springtime collapse of surface ozone in the Arctic for the first time .
Over the last 15 months , the boat has covered 5,200 km ( 3,200 miles ) , including crossing the Noth Pole , drifting at an average speed of 10 km per day ( 6 miles per day ) .
The boat and its crew celebrated their 500th day stuck in the pack ice on the 17 January 2008 .
It was finally set free four days later .
" Toward noon , the ice - edge revealed little by little its face , " wrote Mr Hilaire .
" The ice blocks were apparently at the end of their race , some changing into unusual sculptures in their slow but inescapable death . "
Open water
The boat was implanted into the ice to act as a floating scientific platform .
Increasingly , polar researchers are finding it difficult to establish semi-permanent camps on the sea ice .
" When you are on a boat at least you are floating - this is a big security , " Christian de Marliave , Tara 's scientific director told the BBC last year .
" It 's become very dangerous . "
In 2007 , he said , Russian scientists were unable to find ice thick enough to pitch a safe camp .
However , the trip onboard Tara was not without difficulties , according to the crew .
" We could feel the ice 's strength .
It pressed into the boat and made its structure vibrate at each movement , " Grant Redvers , the expedition chief , said during the early phases of the venture .
Now in open water , the boat and its crew will take approximately three days to reach Spitsbergen , where Tara will go through routine maintenance before continuing to its home port of Lorient in France .
" Tara is navigating in open water but is still encountering ice remnants , " said expedition director Etienne Bourgois .
" [ The boat ] should touch land before the end of the week . "

August 2006 By Rudo de Ruijter , Independent ResearcherNetherlandsAugust 2006
Our politicians have shaped the idea many people have of our world .
They have divided our world into good and bad .
Of course , they are the good guys and the ones they accuse are the bad guys .
Simple , is n't it ?
However , if we stick to the facts , and throw out all the information that comes from unverifiable sources , our world looks very different .
This research article is intended to reveal the facts that lead to the US invasion of Afghanistan and to reveal the logical place of the 9/11events in that context .
It is not meant to offend anyone .
Do n't read it if you are pleased with the " official " version of our history .
Immediately after 9/11 president Bush declared war to Afghanistan .
This article shows the role of Afghanistan in pipeline projects which determine US ' control over oil and gas in Afghanistan 's neighbouring countries .
Bush said the attacks of 9/11 were the reason to invade Afghanistan . [ 1 ]
This article shows that preparations for this war took place well before .
In 2000 the neoconservatives said they needed some catastrophic and catalysing event .
They said so at the time of the developments of unmanned aerial vehicles striking with pinpoint accuracy .
The 1993 attack The attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon on September 11 , 2001 eclipse an earlier attack on the World Trade Centre in 1993 .
On January 20 1993 , William ( Bill ) Clinton had become president .
A month later , on February 26 , an " immense blast happened at 12:18 local time in the Secret Service 's section of the car park underneath and between what are New York 's tallest buildings . " [ 2 ]
BBC published the words of an eyewitness : " It felt like an airplane hit the building . "
Apparently the explosion was intended to bring both WTC towers down .
The New York Times found out that the FBI was involved in the attacks .
The FBI would have infiltrated a group of terrorists , would have known about their intentions and for some unknown reason let it happen . [ 3 ]
Six people died and a hundred were injured . [ 2 ]
1 : Why Afghanistan ?
Immediately after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , US officials accused Osama bin Laden .
Since the man would stay in Afghanistan , it provided a pretext for George W. Bush to attack and invade Afghanistan .
Let 's have a closer look at the situation prior to 9/11 .
As promised by Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev , the USSR had withdrawn its last soldiers from Afghanistan on February 15 , 1989 .
It was the end of ten years of war .
It was also the last war of the Soviet Union .
A few months later , on November 9 , 1989 , the Berlin wall fell .
The Iron Curtain broke down .
The people living on the other side of the curtain , of whom our leaders had always pretended they were dangerous and ferocious , turned out to be as friendly as us .
With the concept of the Cold War our leaders had divided our world and maintained fear in our minds for over forty years .
This terror , fabricated by our own governments , was finally over .
Pipeline projects through Afghanistan On December 25 , 1991 , the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time . [ 4 ]
The former Soviet republics become independent .
Among them were the countries around the Caspian Sea , all rich in oil and gas .
[ MAP : http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/as.htm ]
Before , the oil and gas went through pipelines to their soviet neighbours , or were exported via Russia to Europe .
Now each country could sell its own oil and gas and explore new markets .
Buyers showed up from everywhere .
In the beginning , the new leaders still had no experience with the world oil business .
One of the first deals of Turkmenistan was to auction an oil well for as little as $ 100,000 . [ 5 ]
US companies showed up , too .
The biggest challenge was to get the Caspian oil and gas to the world markets .
The problem ?
The region is land - locked .
If you trust neither Russia on the North side of the Caspian Sea , nor Iran on the South side , you need to build new pipelines .
[ MAP : http://www.treemedia.com/cfrlibrary/library/policy/bremmermap.html ] [ MAP : http://www.treemedia.com/cfrlibrary/library/policy/bremmermap.html ]
Today , from the West side of the Caspian Sea , oil is pumped through several pipelines towards the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea from where it can be shipped .
Big business on the East side of the Caspian Sea is still limited .
To unlock oil and gas from this side , pipelines have to be built through Afghanistan .
Here , since the early nineties , two pipelines - one for gas and one for oil - have been in project .
The oil pipe should go South to the Indian Ocean , ending at the port of Gwadar in Pakistan .
The gas pipe would turn East to Multan in the middle of Pakistan .
From Pakistan an extension is planned to Bombay ( Mumbai , India ) , where a US company with close ties to father and son Bush , Enron , has built a power plant . [ 6 ]
Contracts for pipelines are not just multi-billion dollar projects to build them .
The main contractor generally also buys and sells the oil or gas going through them .
With contracts he disposes of it , determines how much the supplier gets for it , and how much fee is paid to crossed countries .
He determines who gets it , how much , when , to which price and in which currency it has to be paid .
In fact , he determines a lot in the economical developments of both the selling and the buying countries .
With Turkmenistan eager to sell its gas , Pakistan eager to buy it and Enron in India hoping to see it arrive as soon as possible , the pipelines through Afghanistan are of high interest .
However , in 2001 , work in Afghanistan had not started yet .
Since the withdrawal of the Soviets in 1989 there was still unrest in the country .
The Taliban : From ally to terrorist
The unrest in Afghanistan that blocked the business is worth mentioning .
In 1992 , the pro-Russian president Mohammad Najibullah was ousted .
In 1993 , Burhanuddin Rabbani became president , supported by the Tajik minority of the population .
In 1994 , the Pashtun , forming half of the population , challenged Rabbani .
Because the pipelines have to cross mainly Pashtun territory , their movement , the Taliban , had support from the US and Pakistan .
In March 1995 , two companies , BRIDAS from Argentina and UNOCAL from the US , both claimed to have obtained the contracts from the seller of the gas ( Turkmenistan ) and the buyer ( Pakistan ) .
At that moment no deal had yet been signed with the Afghan authorities .
In October 1995 , President Niyazov of Turkmenistan signed an official agreement with UNOCAL , but in February 1996 , president Rabbani of Afghanistan signed an agreement with BRIDAS for the main section of 875 miles through Afghanistan . [ 7 ]
UNOCAL 's chances seemed compromised .
Fortunately for UNOCAL , the Taliban wanted to oust president Rabbani .
In September 1996 , they took Jalabad , Kandahar , and then Kabul .
President Rabbani fleed to join the Northern Alliance .
UNOCAL sighed with relief .
It expressed support for the Taliban takeover , saying it makes the pipeline project easier .
Unocal later said it was misquoted .
Would BRIDAS now have lost the game ?
No .
In November 1996 , BRIDAS signed an agreement with the Taliban and Gen. Dostum to build the pipeline .
Unfortunately , except from Pakistan and Saudi - Arabia , the Taliban government did n't get international recognition .
In April 1997 , as work on the pipeline had still not started , the Taliban announced it would award the contract to whomever starts first .
UNOCAL claimed there must be peace first .
In July 1997 , Turkmenistan and Pakistan accepted a new delay and signed a new contract with UNOCAL , saying it had to start the work within a year and a half .
In December 1997 , UNOCAL tried to become good friends with the Taliban and invited a delegation to their head office in Sugarland , Texas , where they received a VIP treatment and stayed in the best hotels . [ 8 ]
In Afghanistan , civil war went on .
With no internationally recognized legal representative of Afghanistan , the pipeline project seemed to be deadlocked . [ 9 ]
US - bombs on Afghanistan after US embassies are attacked in Africa On February 4 , 1998 and May 30 , 1998 , very heavy earthquakes shook the North East of Afghanistan .
They attracted a lot of international attention and many groups of relief workers came into the North - East of Afghanistan to help .
According to US accusations , this was the moment that somewhere in this same region of Afghanistan a certain Osama bin Laden would have been planning the bombings of two US embassies in Africa , one in Nairobi ( Kenya ) , and one in Dar es Salaam ( Tanzania ) .
The bombings had a high impact in the press .
258 people were killed and some 5,000 injured .
The bombings occurred on August 7 , 1998 , apparently for no specific reason . [ 10 ]
Apparently only president Clinton benefited from it .
In the US , the Monica Lewinsky affair had come to a height .
The press and the public were excited and angry .
Clinton had stated on oath he had had no sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky and now proof had come out he had .
Clinton was close to the point of being convicted of perjury .
The bombings of the embassies drew people 's attention to the drama in Africa .
Finally , on August 17 , Clinton came away with the perjury by arguing that oral sex was not a sexual relation . [ 11 ]
A few days later , August 21 , 1998 , the US military threw bombs on Kandahar and other targets in Afghanistan .
Only afterwards Clinton explained to the journalists this was because of Osama bin Laden , supposed to be behind the bombings of the US ' embassies in Africa . [ 12 ]
Unlike George W. Bush in 2001 , Clinton did not invade Afghanistan .
An invasion would have given hope to UNOCAL to see the Afghan deadlock broken , but with the Lewinsky affair still being discussed , Clinton did not have enough credit for such a war .
On August 28 , 1998 , UNSC resolution 1193 blamed the Taliban for the problems in Afghanistan . [ 13 ]
On November 5 , 1998 , a US Grand Jury indicted Osama Bin Laden .
( Not for the bombings of the embassies in Africa , but essentially for considering the US as his enemy . ) [ 14 ] & [ 15 ]
UNOCAL withdraws
In December 1998 UNOCAL withdrew from the pipeline consortium and , at least for the outside world , the pipeline project seemed halted . [ 8 ]
However , in January , 1999 , Turkmenistan 's foreign minister visited Pakistan , saying the pipeline project was still alive .
In February , BRIDAS had talks with leaders in Turkmenistan , Pakistan and Russia .
In March , Turkmenistan 's Foreign Minister Sheikh Muradov met with Taliban leader Mullah Omar in Kandahar to discuss the pipeline .
In April , Pakistan , Turkmenistan , and the Taliban signed an agreement to revive the pipeline project .
In May , a Taliban delegation signed an agreement with Turkmenistan to buy gas and electricity . [ 8 ]
Terror warning On June 25 , 1999 , the US State Department announced : " As some of our embassies in Africa have been under surveillance by suspicious individuals , we are taking the precaution of temporarily closing our embassies in Gambia , Togo , Madagascar , Liberia , Namibia and Senegal from June 24 through the 27th of June - that is Sunday . " [ 16 ]
The speaker seemed to have no idea where these countries are , considering the strange order of announcing them .
Besides , the only African countries , where incidents like attacks and hostage taking had been reported that year , are Sierra Leone , Nigeria , Burundi and Ethiopia .
None of these countries is on the list . [ 17 ]
On July 4 , 1999 , President Clinton issued an executive order prohibiting commercial transactions with the Taliban . [ 18 ]
Back to Cold War budgets On September 23 , 1999 , presidential candidate George W. Bush exposed his views on the US military .
He complained that since the end of the Cold War the Defence budget had fallen 40 percent and that the army had never been in such a bad shape since Pearl Harbor .
" As president , I will order an immediate review of our overseas deployments - in dozens of countries .
...
My second goal is to build America 's defences on the troubled frontiers of technology and terror . "
Among his views of arms : " In the air , we must be able to strike from across the world with pinpoint accuracy - with long - range aircraft and perhaps with unmanned systems . " [ 19 ]
On October 15 , 1999 , things were getting more serious for the Taliban .
UN resolution 1267 against the Taliban threatened an aircraft ban and funded freezing , if Osama Bin Laden was not handed over before 14 November 1999 . [ 20 ] & [ 2 ]
On November 11 , 1999 , in a press conference , the Taliban minister of Foreign Affairs said Osama bin Laden and the Taliban were unable to organize attacks like those on the embassies in Africa .
He condemned these actions .
In 2000 the US had presidential elections .
It was time to postpone delicate decisions .
On April 2 , 2000 , Richard Clarke , who had been appointed counter - terrorist coordinator a few months before the attacks against the embassies in Africa ( on May 22 ) , predicted : " They will come after our weakness , our Achilles heel , which is largely here in the United States . " [ 21 ]
Curious No - Fly list On April 21 , 2000 , something remarkable happened .
As an antiterrorist measure , the US Congress announced a single unified terrorist watch list , the TID ( or Terrorist Identities Database ) , into which all international terrorist related data available to the US government - mainly the TIPOFF no - fly list - would be stored in a single repository .
In airports , this list is used to prevent suspected people from going on board and from entering the US . [ 22 ]
However , the same day that Congress announces the unified TID list , the FAA created a new and separate domestic no - fly list and put only six names on it .
Two weeks before 9/11 , the list was expanded with six other names , making it a total list of 12 names .
Thanks to this separate list the hijackers of 9/11 , using domestic flights , and not listed among the 12 names , could board the planes without difficulties .
On August 23 , 2001 , two names , later published as being two of the hijackers , had been added to the official TID - list , which counted 60,000 suspects , but was discarded for domestic flights . [ 23 ]
2 : Frustrations and solutions
In September , 2000 , the neoconservative think tank Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) published their imperialistic views for the US . [ 24 ]
In the document , they warned that the process of transforming the US into " tomorrow 's dominant force " would likely be a long one in the absence of " some catastrophic and catalysing event - like a new Pearl Harbor " . [ 25 ]
A few months later , many PNAC members would become members of the Bush administration .
Those members include Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , and Richard Perle . [ 26 ]
Three month after 9/11 , to those who would not yet have understood the benefits of the catastrophic and catalysing event of US military debacle in Pearl Harbor in 1941 , Bush would explain : " The four years that followed transformed the American way of war " and " even more importantly , an American President and his successors shaped a world beyond a war . "
And , linking 9/11 to Pearl Harbor , he said , " September 11th , 2001 - three months and a long time ago - set another dividing line in our lives and in the life of our nation . " [ 27 ]
On October 12 , 2000 , three weeks before the presidential elections , the US population was shortly reminded of the terrorist threat in the world .
US
Navy destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden was rammed with an inflatable raft with explosives and was damaged .
Published detail : it looked as if the raft was coming to help the warship to moor to a buoy . [ 28 ]
Message : you can trust nobody .
On November 7 , 2000 the elections took place .
It would be George W. Bush or Al Gore .
The counting gave an extremely close result .
The results of Florida became decisive , but these results are far from clear .
The opponents fought in many different courts until December 13 .
It turned out that in Florida , 180,000 votes had been thrown out of the counting .
Bush led by less than 600 votes .
Partial recounts resulted in much lower estimates .
Finally , all recounts could not be executed within the time limit set by the Supreme Court .
This is how Bush won the elections . [ 29 ]
Dictator
A few days later , on December 18 , speaking at the Capitol , Bush joked about his starting relationship with the four congressional leaders : " If this were a dictatorship , it would be a heck of a lot easier .... just so long as I'm the dictator . " [ 30 ]
Just a slip of the tongue ?
Not really .
In July 1998 , about governing Texas , he said already : " A dictatorship would be a lot easier . " [ 31 ]
And on July 26 , 2001 , speaking once again about his struggles with Congress he repeated : " a dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier . " [ 32 ]
Well , for the ambitious plans of the neoconservatives , the US Congress was a major hurdle to take .
The budget of the military had shrunk by 40 percent after the Cold War and with the wars they had in mind they would need substantially more budget .
How would they get the budget they wanted ?
If the US would be attacked , there would be no problem .
They would receive all the budget and support they needed .
But , as written in their document , without a new Pearl Harbor things would go slowly . [ 25 ]
When Bush started his presidency , many neoconservatives considered Iraq as the first target to hit .
In their document of September 2000 they had named Iraq as a " potential rival " of the US . [ 24 ]
First Target Iraq ?
Iraq has the world 's second largest oil reserves .
The country was exhausted .
It had tried to conquer Iran from 1980 to 1988 , had invaded Kuwait in 1990 , had been defeated by Operation Desert Storm in 1991 , and since then a UN embargo had brought the Iraqi economy to a standstill and the population at the edge of starvation .
Since 1996 , the Oil For Food program of the UN had brought some relief for the Iraqi people .
The country had been disarmed .
Extensive weapon inspections had concluded the country formed no threat anymore .
Well , at least , not military .
In 2000 , Saddam had still found a trick to hit the main pillar of US hegemony , the dollar .
He started to sell his oil in euros , instead of dollars . [ http://www.raisethehammer.org/index.asp?id=252 , see : Dollar Hegemony ]
Afghanistan back on the agenda However , not even a week after George W. Bush had been declared winner of the elections , Afghanistan was back on the international agenda .
UN SC resolution 1333 of December 19 , 2000 , imposed the sanctions the UN had promised more than a year before , in October 1999 , if the Taliban would not hand over Osama bin Laden before November 14 , 1999 ( aircraft ban and funds freezing ) . [ 33 ]
Geopolitically , Afghanistan had become a more urgent target .
Since 1996 , the US had experienced severe setbacks in their ambition to control gas and oil on the East side of the Caspian Sea and was loosing influence .
The problems had started in February 1996 , when Afghan president Rabbani signed a contract with UNOCAL 's competitor BRIDAS for the construction of the gas pipeline through Afghanistan , between Turkmenistan and Pakistan . [ 8 ]
In March , the US tried to block this deal , putting pressure on Pakistan and telling them they should grant exclusive rights to UNOCAL .
This resulted in a diplomatic clash with the Pakistani government . [ 8 ]
Still , in the same month , Pakistan officially agreed to allow a proposed Iranian pipeline to run over Pakistani territory on its way to India , thus enabling Iranian gas sale to India .
The gas would come from Iran 's giant South Pars Field in the Persian Gulf and cross the South of Iran from West to East through a pipeline still to be constructed . [ 34 ]
Meanwhile , in February 1996 , Turkmenistan had showed it did not want to depend exclusively on the delayed Afghan pipeline project and had signed a contract with Turkey to supply Turkmen gas via a pipeline to be constructed along the North coast of Iran .
If necessary , Turkey would be able to absorb all the Turkmen gas . [ 34 ]
Iranian - Libyan Sanctions act With these two Iranian pipelines the Afghan pipelines would become more or less useless .
To prevent the construction of the Iranian pipelines the US Congress passed the Iranian - Libyan Sanctions act , [ 35 ] threatening anyone who would help Iran constructing them , and forbidding transactions with Iran of $ 4 million or higher .
That was on June 18 , 1996 .
Nevertheless on August 30 , 1996 Turkey signed a 20 - year deal to buy gas from Iran . [ 34 ] & [ 36 ]
The Turkish president would be punished for his Islamic solidarity by a military coup forcing him to resign .
That was on June 18 , 1997 . [ 37 ]
With the Iranian - Libyan Sanctions act was in place , another US company , Enron , expanded its activities in the region .
In Uzbekistan , Enron had obtained a contract for 11 gas fields .
In April 1997 , George W. Bush himself had intervened to help Enron obtain Uzbeki contracts . [ 38 ]
Enron counted on a US controlled pipeline through Afghanistan to export a part of the Uzbek gas to its power plant in India . [ 39 ]
The US threatened sanctions and blocked the completion of the Turkish pipeline connexion to Iran , so the gas deliveries from Iran to Turkey were delayed several years .
In August 2000 , Iran and Turkey agreed the gas deliveries would start on July 30 , 2001 , which would be a few days before the expiration date of the Iranian - Libyan Sanctions act . [ 40 ]
Despite the Iranian - Libyan Sanctions act , the construction of the northern pipeline had started on the East side of Iran .
Funded by Iran itself , Iran and Turkmenistan opened an international pipeline connexion of 200 km by the end of 1997 . [ 36 ]
To frustrate further development of the Iranian pipeline to Turkey , the US came up with an idea for an alternative route from Turkmenistan , crossing the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan and from there to Turkey .
Enron did the study for this project . [ 39 ]
By that time it looked as if the Afghan pipeline project would be abandoned .
In June 1998 , Enron withdrew from its Uzbek gas projects [ 41 ] and in December UNOCAL withdrew from its consortium for the Afghan pipeline . [ 8 ]
The US threats did not prevent big companies like Shell and Total from signing deals with Iran for exploration of oil and gas . [ 42 ]
Nevertheless ,
Shell withdrew from its pipeline project in Northern Iran . [ 43 ]
The undersea pipeline crossing the Caspian Sea now existed on the drawing table , but in the waters the five surrounding countries ( Azerbaijan , Russia , Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan , and Iran ) had not yet come to an agreement about each other 's borders , and thus about the ownership of oil fields .
As long as this would last , according to an existing agreement of 1940 , Russia and Iran would have to agree with the pipeline under the sea .
And they did not . [ 44 ]
In 2000 , the Turkmen president had blamed the US for the delay in the trans - Caspian pipeline and had resumed gas deliveries to Russia . [ 45 ]
That May , president Putin had even come to Turkmenistan to offer extended deals for several years . [ 9 ]
Meanwhile , in Kazakhstan , the oil from the Tengiz field ( world 's sixth largest oil field ) was going to be pumped via Russia to the Black Sea . [ 46 ]
George W. Bush sworn in On January 20 , 2001 , George W. Bush was sworn in as president of the US .
He is the son of ex-president George H.W. Bush .
The family is from Texas and has close ties with the oil and energy related companies there .
These companies have contributed a lot to Bush 's election campaign .
Companies contributing to election campaigns is a common phenomenon in the US .
The financial support for candidates ' campaigns determines how much marketing they can afford and , ultimately , their chances to win the elections .
Of course , when these companies invest a lot of money , they expect something in return when their candidate wins , like nominations in the administration , influence for big business orders or favourable laws and amendments . [ 47 ]
Enron Enron had been the biggest contributor of the Bush 2000 election campaign . [ 48 ]
In fact , the company had generously contributed to father and son's election campaigns since 1985 .
Enron 's chairman , Kenneth Lay , had close personal contacts with the Bushes .
He had even been a sleeping guest at the White House . [ 49 ]
During these years , Enron had expanded from a regional energy supplier to a giant multinational and the seventh biggest company in the US .
Although loaded with debts caused by its giant investments abroad , Enron always showed splendid results .
How ?
In 1997 the Securities and Exchange Commission had exempted Enron from the Investment Company Act of 1940 that prohibits US companies from leaving debt from overseas projects off the books . [ 47 ]
At the same time Andy Fastow , Enron 's senior vice president of finance , had started his " creative " financing . [ 50 ]
Since 1993 , in India , Enron had invested $ 2.9 billion for a power plant near Bombay .
Originally it had counted on cheap supply of gas from Turkmenistan via the planned pipeline through Afghanistan .
The power plant project had turned into a nightmare .
Enron had faced severe criticism over their contemptuous way of doing business .
They had experienced severe opposition from the local population after hiring police officers to beat down protests of opponents .
Charges had been filed against the company for human right violations . [ 39 ]
Last but not least , the price of the produced electricity averaged more than double the price of power from other suppliers . [ 51 ]
Taking into account the real cost supported by the regional electricity company , Enron 's price was even 700 percent higher . [ 52 ]
The regional electricity company could not pay Enron 's bills anymore .
As retaliation , in January 2001 , Enron had cut the power for 200 million people in Northern India , demanding three times the normal price . [ 53 ]
( Around the same time , Enron provoked power cuts in California too , also in order to obtain higher prices . [ 54 ] )
In 1997 Enron had started gas projects in Uzbekistan , for which George W. Bush had had personal contacts with the Uzbek ambassador .
As soon as the Bush administration was in place , vice president Cheney would reward Enron for their support during the elections .
Enron 's chairman , Kenneth Lay , had a wish list that was almost entirely included in Cheney 's proposals for the new US energy policy . [ 55 ]
Cheney also intervened to help Enron collect a $ 64 million debt for its power plant near Bombay , during a meeting with Indian opposition leader Sonia Ghandi in Washington on June 27 2001 . [ 56 ]
BinLaden Group Enron had also connexions with the construction firm BinLadin from Saudi Arabia , with which it constructed a power plant in the Gaza strip .
( The power plant would not be finished before Enron 's bankruptcy in December 2001 . ) [ 57 ]
The wealthy bin Laden family is well known to the Bush family .
Salem bin Laden supplied part of the money for George W. Bush first oil company , Arbusto , in 1978 . [ 58 ]
The father of George W. Bush , after being US ' president , joined the Carlyle group [ 59 ] and developed relations with the BinLadin company . [ 60 ]
He met the family in November 1998 and in January 2000 . [ 61 ]
Bin Laden also invested in the Carlyle group .
H.W. Bush still met with Shafig bin Laden , Osama 's brother , on September 10 , 2001 at the annual investor conference of the Carlyle Group . [ 62 ]
Like Enron , Carlyle had made a tremendous development .
In the early 1990s son Bush had been member of the board of a catering service for airliners . [ 60 ]
Carlyle had bought the catering company .
Although the catering service crashed , Carlyle has grown into an important defence contractor in the US . [ 61 ]
A bunch of well - known former politicians , including George W. Bush father , former UK Prime Minister John Major and former president of the Philippines Mister Ramos , are making a lot of money from the " war on terror " . [ 59 ]
Osama
There is a terrible lot of information available about bin Laden 's son , Osama .
However , almost all of it comes from sources that cannot be verified , like comments by unknown people who would have known him or met him .
Other stories are based on allegations by people who have big business interests in the " war on terrorism " , like the Bush .
One step further , you find the comments by officials " convinced " that everything that has been said about Osama is true .
On the other extremity , there is the image Osama draws of himself in an interview by CNN reporter Peter Arnett in 1997 .
According to this interview he is , first of all , a faithful , who understands people who fight against the US soldiers who came to steal the oil and who attacked the Islamic religion .
He denies having organized any attacks against the US himself . [ 63 ]
( Many people will remember a videotape with ì Osama 's confessionî , that he knew about the attacks of 9/11 in advance , which turned out to be a fake . [ 64 ] )
Osama would become Bush 's key excuse to invade Afghanistan .
On September 17 , 2001 Bush would declare Osama bin Laden was wanted " dead or alive " . [ 65 ]
Why did Osama bin Laden stay in Afghanistan ?
Here too , different sources give different stories .
He had already been in Afghanistan during the eighties , helping the mudjahedeen fight against the Soviet occupation ( as did the US ) .
Back in Saudi Arabia in 1989 , he had opposed the king 's alliance with the US .
When his passport was confiscated , he at first fled back to Afghanistan , and then settled in Sudan in 1992 , where all Muslims were welcome since a regime change the year before .
In 1994 , because of his support to fundamentalist Muslim movements , Saudi Arabia revoked his citizenship and froze his funds . [ 66 ]
After the assassination attempt against Egyptian president Mubarak in Ethiopia on June 26 , 1995 , Sudan was accused of being behind it .
The relations between Egypt and Sudan deteriorate in the current of 1995 .
At this point , let us jump to Afghanistan .
In February 1996 things went wrong for the US pipeline project in Afghanistan .
President Rabbani of Afghanistan contracted the Argentinean BRIDAS instead of UNOCAL for the construction and exploitation of the gas pipeline .
For the US , to get the pipeline project back in the hands of UNOCAL , Rabbani would have to disappear .
But who could be accused if Rabbani were killed ?
Back to Sudan .
March 8 , 1996 , the US suddenly asked Sudan to extradite Osama .
It did not specify to which country .
Since the Saudis took his passport and nationality away , Osama had few options .
On May 18 , 1996 , he left Sudan and returned to Afghanistan . [ 67 ]
Years afterward , many people were still wondering why he had not been arrested at that occasion .
In Afghanistan , events would take a different turn .
From March 20 to April 4 , 1996 , Taliban leaders had held a shura ( meeting ) and concluded with a jihad against Rabbani . [ 68 ]
Osama arrived on May 18 , but would not get involved .
On September 27 , the Taliban conquered Kabul and president Rabbani fled and joined the Northern alliance .
At that moment things must have looked hopeful for the UNOCAL pipeline project .
Unfortunately for them , in November 1996 BRIDAS signed a new contract with the Taliban .
Ultimately this would lead to the eviction from power of the Taliban .
Clinton would not attack Afghanistan after the US embassy bombings in Africa in 1998 , maybe thanks to Monica Lewinsky .
Bush did , after " the catastrophic and catalysing events " of 9/11 .
After having used the presence of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan as his key excuse to invade the country , Bush would state , on March 13 , 2002 , he was n't truly that concerned about Osama bin Laden . [ 69 ]
Karzai
After the US conquest of Afghanistan ( or at least of its capital ) , UNOCAL 's advisor Hamid Karzai would be appointed Chairman of the interim administration of Afghanistan .
On June 16 , 2002 , still before there was an elected president , Karzai would sign an official agreement with Turkmenistan and Pakistan for a gas pipeline through Afghanistan . [ 70 ]
But even if the gas pipeline would come too late to transport Turkmen gas to Pakistan , Afghanistan remains an interesting booty .
It has its own gigantic gas field south of the Turkmen field , near Mazar e Sharif .
It has also several oil fields and coal .
Furthermore , in the 1970s British geologists had already found 1600 places with minerals .
3 : Preparations for 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan Timing of the attacks
As noticed above , the timing for the attacks on the US embassies in Africa helped Clinton , as it drew away the attention from his threatening conviction of perjury in the Monica Lewinsky affair , and focused on the common enemies : the terrorists .
The invasion of Afghanistan would have to wait for the next US president .
Between 1998 and 2001 there was enough time to plan everything carefully .
Below we will notice , that the attacks of 9/11 occurred at the very moment everything was in place .
The only thing missing was a pretext to get support from Congress , from the US population and the rest of the world Ö
Military preparations
For the US to invade Afghanistan at the other side of the world was a delicate operation .
Step by step the US had pushed its influence and control in the former soviet republics .
US oil and gas related companies had started up activities in Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and US ' military had gained influence in the region , challenging Russia and China in their backyards .
Already in 1997 , north of Afghanistan , the US had considerably expanded its military " cooperation " with Kazakhstan , which forms the buffer with Russia . [ 71 ]
In 1999 , closer to Afghanistan , the US expanded its presence in Kyrgyzstan [ 72 ] , and in Uzbekistan , one of Afghanistan 's direct neighbours . [ 73 ]
April 14 - 15 , 2000 , Uzbek and US troops conducted joint military exercises . [ 74 ]
East of Afghanistan the US administration has strong ties with the Pakistani intelligence service .
Its director , Lieutenant - General Mahmoud Ahmad , was with US ' officials the week before and during the attacks of 9/11 . [ 75 ]
On the west side F - 15 were based in Saudi - Arabia , Kuwait and Turkey and the Fifth fleet was permanently based in the Persian Gulf . [ 76 ]
For the war in Afghanistan , huge transports of troops and material had to be organized well before the invasion .
On November 7 , 2000 , the day all US - citizens were occupied with the election of their president , the UK announced its biggest military exercise since the Gulf War , operation Swift Sword ( Saif Sareea in Arabic ) , involving 24,000 troops and a lot of heavy material . [ 77 ]
The exercise took place in Oman , a strategic location , since all oil tankers from the Persian Gulf region ( Saudi - Arabia , the United Arabic Emirates , Qatar , Quait , Iraq and Iran ) have to cross the Gulf of Oman .
Here the UK detaines a War Material Storage . [ 78 ]
They exercised on the coast of Oman from September 15 until the end of October 2001 , [ 79 ] and started moving their material in August 2001 . [ 80 ]
The UK participated in the invasion . [ 81 ]
From October 8 until the end of October , 2001 another military operation was planned in Egypt : NATO Operation Bright Star .
It was the world 's largest exercise with more than 11 Nations , and over 70,000 troops ( among which 23,000 from the US ) participating . [ 82 ]
Among several other " coincidental " military moves towards Afghanistan , we notice that on July 23 2001 aircraft carrier Carl Vinson was sent out from Bremerton ( on US West coast ) to the Arabian Sea .
It arrived just in time to launch the first air strikes on Afghanistan on October 7 , 2001 . [ 83 ]
Diplomatic preparations
On the diplomatic front , to lower the risk of upsetting China , on June 19 2001 , Bush had proposed to attend the APEC summit in Shang Hai and was expected to meet president Zemir between October 15 and October 21 2001 . [ 84 ] & [ 85 ]
( Bush 's meeting with presidents Zemir and Putin took place on October 20 , 2001 ) [ 86 ]
Besides , in 2001 China was completing its bilateral agreements with all 37 WTO members to become a full WTO - member .
China wanted to become member since many years .
China 's bilateral agreement with Mexico would be the last and this would complete China 's membership . [ 87 ]
In July 2001 Bush would polish his relations with Mexico , " lobbying " against US unfair import restrictions on Mexican trucks . [ 88 ]
This was probably not only to get the Mexicans in the right mood to sign with China , but also because Mexico would be member of the UN Security Council in 2002 and 2003 .
China reached its bilateral agreement with Mexico and became WTO member on September 13 , 2001 . [ 89 ]
Bush 's unmanned systems
In the summer of 1999 , a number of US embassies on the African continent were closed for the weekend because of suspicious people hanging around . [ 16 ]
A few days later Clinton had issued its order prohibiting commercial transactions with the Taliban . [ 18 ]
A few months later George W. Bush presented his ideas of defences " on the troubled frontiers of technology and terror . "
He said , " In the air , we must be able to strike from across the world with pinpoint accuracy - with long - range aircraft and perhaps with unmanned systems . " [ 19 ]
In September 1999 Bush still said " perhaps " .
He was still considering .
This was at a time the market for unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV's ) for both military as well as civil aviation was rapidly developing . [ 90 ]
By 2001 there were more than 60 types of UAV world wide , from small models to big planes . [ 91 ]
At the time of Bush 's speech in 1999 , the US was developing Global Hawk [ 92 ] , a military UAV with a wing span comparable to a Boeing 737 , which had made its first flight from Edwards Air Force Base , CA on 28 February 1998 . [ 93 ]
After Bush became president , on April 23 , 2001 the Global Hawk made a historical first unmanned test flight to Australia . [ 94 ]
9/11
Not all material about 9/11 has been released to the public .
Some of the reliable evidence has been confiscated by the CIA . [ 95 ]
Statements of officials often turned out to be contradictory .
And , in particular about possible advanced knowledge , the White House has confiscated dozens of documents of the 9/11 Commission . [ 96 ]
It does n't make truth finding easier .
The official version of the events on 9/11 involves a very high number of coincidences that facilitated the " success " of the attacks .
A nationwide military exercise , Global Guardian , originally planned for November 2001 , is in full swing , creating confusion between exercises and real - world events . [ 97 ]
A large - scale military exercise , Vigilant Guardian , is taking place and involves all of NORAD , the defence department , which normally sends fighter jets after civil airplanes several times a week , when flight control operators report incidences . [ 97 ]
The Vigilant Guardian exercise simulates an air attack on the United States . [ 97 ]
NORAD is also running a planned real - world operation named Operation Northern Vigilance , for which many NORAD fighters are located in Alaska and Canada . [ 98 ]
Operation Northern Vigilance also creates false blips on radar screens at least until the second plane crashes into the World Trade Centre . [ 99 ]
In Washington a planned National Reconnaissance Office exercise involves a scenario of an airplane as a flying weapon . [ 97 ]
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is flying across the Atlantic on the way to Europe . [ 97 ]
The Federal Emergency Management Agency Director is at a conference in Montana . [ 97 ]
FAA hijack coordinator , who has to contact the National Military Command Centre in case of hijacks , is in Puerto Rico and can not be reached . [ 97 ]
All of FBI 's anti-terrorist and top special operations agents are , together with the members of the CIA 's anti-terrorist task force , on a training exercise in Monterey , California . [ 97 ]
For the day of 9/11 , the commander of the National Military Command Centre had requested to be replaced by someone without experience . [ 97 ]
For FAA 's new National Operations Manager it is the first day on the job . [ 98 ]
The hijackers can board without trouble , since the official no - fly list is only used for international flights and , curiously , not for domestic flights . [ 22 ] & [ 23 ]
Informed a few minutes after the start of the first hijack ( Flight 11 ) , American Airlines top management decide to " keep it quiet " . [ 97 ]
Boston flight controllers do not follow normal procedures and loose time by contacting various military bases , instead of NORAD . [ 97 ]
After NORAD is finally informed , two F - 15 will remain on the ground and only take off when flight 11 already crashes into the WTC . [ 97 ]
For various reasons F - 16 will only arrive on scene after the last plane has crashed . [ 97 ] & [ 99 ]
A decision is taken to ground not only civil airplanes , but also all military planes . [ 99 ]
The presumed hijacker pilot of flight 77 was not able to fly a Cessna without difficulty in August , but succeeded to spiral down a Boeing 757 and hit the Pentagon a few meters above the ground on September 11 . [ 100 ]
The President does n't give any orders responding to the attack until just before the last plane crashes . [ 97 ]
Above I only mentioned those coincidences that facilitated the success of the attacks .
If I were to build a story on such series of coincidences , nobody would believe me .
Well , I would not either .
Keeping the things in their context , it makes more sense to look at them as facts , and not as coincidences .
Above I only mentioned those coincidences that facilitated the success of the attacks .
If I were to build a story on such series of coincidences , nobody would believe me .
Well , I would not either .
Keeping the things in their context , it makes more sense to look at them as facts , and not as coincidences .
All released details show that the attacks of 9/11 were carried out with military precision .
However , the hijackers on the planes would have been improvised pilots without the extraordinary skills needed to fly like has been reported . [ 101 ] & [ 102 ]
Besides , they would not have been intelligent enough to foresee the reactions triggered by their actions .
Apparently they had so little political awareness , they had not heard about the neoconservatives waiting for such a " catastrophic and catalysing event " to speed up US ' conquests .
The success of the plan relied on a lot of advanced knowledge of the situation that day , like the confusion offered by planned military exercises and the scenarios played by them , like the confusion offered by fake radar blibs , like traffic controllers lacking of primary radar images in specific areas , like the absence of several experienced officers in the command chains responding to the hijacks , like the absence of armed jet fighters to frustrate their plans .
All this seems more the work of a more influential and well trained organization , an organization willing to provide the justification for the neoconservatives ' conquest plans , with Afghanistan as first target .
It does not seem likely to me that such an organization would let the success of its operation depend on the improvised skills of the hijackers .
It makes more sense to suppose the hijackers were not in control .
( In spite of an overheard phrase in the cockpit of the fourth plane , having been translated as " Pull it down " and by officials interpreted as " Crash the plane " [ 102 ] )
It seems more likely the operation was conducted on the troubled frontier of technology and terror , and that technology had taken over the controls .
The two types of planes used , Boeing 757 and 767 , can be controlled remotely .
Robert Ayling , a former boss of British Airways , suggested in the Financial Times a few days after 9/11 that aircraft could be commandeered from the ground and controlled remotely in the event of a hijack . [ 13 ]
On 9/11 the remote control would have been in the hands of the wrong people .
If we look closer to the remote control scenario , we notice that if the published details about the transponders are right : 1 . the transponder of the second 767 is turned off shortly after the first 767 crashes .
2 . the transponder of the second 757 is turned off shortly after the first 757 crashes .
So , it looks as if one remote pilot handled the two 767 one after the other , and another remote pilot handled the two 757 one after the other .
( [ 104 ] 9/11 Commission Report , P.32 , 8:47 & 9:41 )
It has also been reported that a C - 130 military cargo plane was tailing flight 77 when it crashed into the Pentagon .
The same C - 130 was behind flight 93 when it crashed .
Did the plane play a role ?
Or was it just a coincidental tourist , flying around while all other planes had been ordered to land ? [ 101 ] , [ 105 ] , [ 106 ]
The hijackers hijacked ?
Although the official story asks us to believe the hijackers wanted to fly into the WTC and the Pentagon , the released pieces of cockpit conversations offer no indications to support this theory .
Although mountains of stories and counter - stories have been published about the hijackers , I did not find a single verifiable element .
If the hijackers were to support some Arabic or Islamic cause , they would probably be in a stronger position if they had returned to airports with four planes and hundreds of US citizens in their might .
They could have negotiated the release of political prisoners .
They could have demanded a retreat of US forces from Saudi Arabia .
They could have pleaded any cause they were after .
Did the hijackers really have in mind to strike the WTC and the Pentagon or were they overruled by the organization that had " contracted " them ?
Will we find out ?
According to the official story , all radio contact and overhearing of cockpit conversations stopped before the planes made their final approach of the WTC and the Pentagon .
If the hijackers were to create the biggest possible spectacle , would n't they have shouted a last accusation against the US or a last glorious prayer to Allah ?
Or were they surprised and in panic when they flew into the buildings ?
Conclusion
The Afghan pipelines are only one step in US political moves to take over the influence in the oil and gas rich former Soviet republics .
Consuming 25 percent of the world oil consumption , their imperialism is first of all about energy .
Today the US already relies for over 60 percent on foreign oil , a percentage that is quickly increasing .
The neoconservative ideas to transform the US into a " dominant force " do not come out of nowhere .
The thought that they needed a " catastrophic and catalysing event " was not just motivated by the personal financial benefits several of them get from the war industries .
It was also a sign of panic of a nation facing drying up oil wells and preparing itself to conquer foreign oil wells until the last drip is gone . [ 1 ]

A team of US researchers also found that switchgrass - derived ethanol produced 540 % more energy than was required to manufacture the fuel .
One acre ( 0.4 hectares ) of the grassland could , on average , deliver 320 gallons of bioethanol , they added .
Their paper appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The five - year study , involving 10 farms ranging in size from three to nine hectares , was described as the largest study of its kind by the paper 's authors .
Co-author Ken Vogel of the US Department of Agriculture 's ( USDA ) Agriculture Research Service , based at the University of Nebraska , Lincoln , said that all previous energy analyses had been based on data from research plots and estimated inputs .
Last year , a team of scientists had also examined the energy gains from ethanol produced from switchgrass , but their model suggested that the net gain was in the region of 343 % , which was considerably less than the USDA team 's findings .
" A lot of their information was based on small plot data and also estimates of what would be needed in the agronomic production of biofuels , " Dr Vogel explained .
" We had on - farm trials , so we had all the data from the farmers on all the inputs needed to produce the crops .
" We were able to take this information and put it into this model and able to come up with a very real - world estimate . "
The energy inputs required to produce the crops included nitrogen fertiliser , herbicides , diesel and seed production .
However , he added that as there were no large - scale biorefineries in operation , the team did have to estimate how much bioethanol such a plant would be able to produce in order to calculate the net energy gain .
" Right now , the Department of Energy is co-funding the construction of six biorefineries in the US .
These plants will be completed around 2010 , and will be above the pilot plant scale . "
Although the process to produce ethanol from switchgrass was more complex than using food crops such as wheat or corn , the so - called " second generation " biofuel could produce much higher energy yields per tonne because it utilised the whole plant rather than just the seeds .
Carbon cuts
The team also calculated that the production and consumption of switchgrass - derived ethanol cut CO2 emissions by about 94 % when compared with an equivalent volume of petrol .
SWITCHGRASS FACTS Scientific name : Panicum virgatum L Species is a perennial grass Distribution : North and South America , parts of Africa Grows to heights of 0.5 - 2.5 m
Produces an average of 320 gallons of bioethanol per acre ( Source : USDA ; Cardiff School of Biosciences )
Burning biofuels releases carbon dioxide , but growing the plants absorbs a comparable amount of the gas from the atmosphere .
However , the energy inputs used during the growing and processing of the crops means the fuel is rarely " carbon neutral " .
" Greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions of ethanol from switchgrass , using only the displacement method , showed 88 % less GHG emissions than conventional ethanol , " the researchers wrote .
" The use of ... biomass residue for energy at a ... biorefinery is the main reason why switchgrass and human - made prairies have theoretically lower GHG emissions than biofuels from annual ( food ) crops , where processing is currently derived from fossil fuels . "
A number of organisations , including the UN , have expressed concern that biofuels could do more harm than good .
The criticisms of the technology include taking large areas of arable land out of food production , inflating crop prices and limited carbon emission savings .
" In contrast to most European countries , the US has quite a bit of land that is being held outside of ( food ) production at the moment , " Dr Vogel told BBC News .
" We are looking at the use of switchgrass on marginal cropland The intent is to have energy crops being grown on marginal cropland , so it would not be in competition with food crops on our best land .
He also added that there were other factors within the process of producing the biofuel that limited its financial and environmental feasibility .
" Because there is going to be a lot of tonnage of material shipped to the biorefinery , there is going to be some economics involved . "
In order to maximise the carbon reductions , he said : " A biorefinery will have a feedstock supply radius of about 25 to 50 miles , so the feedstock of any biorefinery needs to be localised . "
As the switchgrass had to be sourced within the local area , Dr Vogel said it was important that the land delivered a high yield of grass in order to meet the refinery 's demands .
Annual rainfall was a key factor affecting the delivery of the necessary yields .

However , the arrest of Roberto Preatoni , reportedly on charges related to a well publicized Italian spying scandal , has not affected the organization 's day - to - day operations , according to a statement released by the Switzerland - based group .

Thanks to a “ White Knight ” ( in VERY shiny armour ! ) who came carrying a cheque for $ 55,600 , the New Hampshire recount is BACK ON !
Well done EVERYBODY !
The combination of the pressure from all of you and the investigations into the various people causing this to be seemingly impossible some 12 hours or so ago has won through !
The Secretary of State for New Hampshire , William M. Gardner , has retreated form his “ too late ” stance to a position of “ Ok , if the money gets here by 15:00 today . ”
The money arrived , was handed to Albert Howard and paid , in full , to the Secretary of State .
This is an historic victory for the people of America .
Somebody told me today that we have done more for US politics and vote protection in the past 5 days than any other generation in 100 years .
They may well be right !
Following is the message I received from Albert a little while ago , confirming that the payment has been made and the recount WILL take place .
Albert asks for your further help in going to New Hampshire to ensure that the vote recount takes place fairly and without compromise .
Please , if you have so much as half a day to spare and can make the trip , DO SO !
Well done again everybody .
We have taken back New Hampshire ... Now for the rest of the country !
Best wishes and good luck ,
Shaun
The money for the New Hampshire recount has been secured .
The ball is rolling !!
Bushehr is only the first reactor in Iran 's nuclear programme
But Tehran says it will not stop the uranium enrichment process despite the threat of further UN sanctions .
It is the first time Iran has received a fuel delivery from Russia , which is building the Bushehr plant .
Tehran insists it is pursuing peaceful power generation only , despite fears it could try to build a bomb .
The arrival of the first Russian shipment came days after Moscow and Tehran agreed on a schedule to finish building the Bushehr plant after years of delays .
While the UN continues to demand that Iran halt uranium enrichment , it has approved the Russian deliveries .
' Still a threat '
Confirming that Moscow had notified the US about the shipment , President George W Bush said the Russian shipment proved the Iranians did " not need to learn how to enrich " uranium for themselves .
BUSHEHR NUCLEAR PLANT
Begun in 1974 with German assistance Work halts after Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution Resumed in 1992 with Russian help 13 Dec : Russia and Iran agree to finish plant after numerous delays
Two pressurised water reactors
One believed near completion , could begin operating in eight months Cost : $ 1b n
Russia ignores
West 's fears
The nuclear fuel cycle
He said that Iran remained a " threat to peace " if its own enrichment , a crucial step towards constructing nuclear weapons , was not stopped .
" They 're heading down a path of isolation right now and economic sanctions , " he added .
" We passed two resolutions out of the UN and [ US Secretary of State ] Condi Rice is working on a third . "
After a recent US intelligence report which found that Iran had stopped an alleged nuclear weapons programme in 2003 , Mr Bush said Tehran could not be trusted .
" If somebody had a weapons programme , what 's to say they could n't start it up tomorrow ? " , he asked earlier this month .
" Since they tried to hide their programme before , how would we know ? "
Shipments begin
Atomstroiexport , the Russian company building the Bushehr plant , said the delivery of the enriched uranium fuel began on Sunday .
The final delivery , it said , would be made in February .
Russian officials said earlier that the plant could be operational within six months of fuel being delivered .
Gholam Reza Aghazadeh , head of Iran 's atomic energy agency , said the plant would begin operating some time in the new year .
He stressed that nuclear enrichment work would not stop as a result of the Russian deliveries , saying fuel was needed for a reactor under construction in Darkhovin , south - west Iran .
Enriched uranium is used as fuel in nuclear power stations .
When it is more highly enriched , it can be used to make nuclear weapons .
The story depicted here is 100 % true .
Any similarities in tone and style to The Daily WTF are intentional .
Update : Never assume that you are alone in your madness .
In the board game Mouse Trap , players build an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine .
Wikipedia explains :
The player turns the crank ( A ) which rotates the gears ( B ) causing the lever ( C ) to move and push the stop sign against the shoe ( D ) , which tips the bucket holding the metal ball ( E ) which rolls down the stairs ( F ) and into the pipe ( G ) which leads it to hit the rod held by the hands ( H ) , causing the bowling ball ( I ) to fall from the top of the rod , roll down the groove ( J ) , fall into and then out of the bottom of the bathtub ( K ) , landing on the diving board ( L ) .
The weight of the bowling ball catapults the diver ( M ) through the air and right into the bucket ( N ) , causing the cage ( O ) to fall from the top of the post ( P ) and trap the unsuspecting mouse ( i.e. the player who occupies the spot on the board at that time ) .
Software sometimes suffers from a Mouse Trap Architecture , it becomes a chain of fundamentally incompatible components used for purposes far removed from their core competencies , incomprehensibly connected to each other with brittle technologies .
And here is the tale of how one such system came about .
The project was originally designed by a Business Analyst who had been a DBA in her younger days .
One of the key requirements of the system was that it be completely flexible : it was designed to accommodate almost any change in business requirements without reprogramming .
Her approach to designing a program that would be very nearly Turing - complete was to make a data - driven design : nearly none of the business logic was to be written in code , it was to exist in various tables in the database .
Changes to business logic would be accomplished by updating the database .
Of course , the application would just be an empty shell , so the actual business analysis would consist of gathering requirements and generating data for the tables .
The program was obviously trivial and could be generated in parallel with the business analysis , delivering a huge time saving over her company ’s traditional waterfall model where analysis was completed in its entirety before the first line of code was written .
Delighted with this breakthrough methodology , all parties signed off on a seven figure contract and she started by building a large Excel workbook with the business rules , one sheet per table .
The plan was to simply export her workbook to CSVs and import them into the database when they were ready to deploy the finished application .
And in the mean time , the customer could sign off on the business rules by inspecting the Excel workbook .
Meanwhile , the trivial job of designing a web application for two hundred internal users plus a substantial public site to handle millions of users with unpredictable peak loads was handed off to the Architect .
While her Golden Hammer was the database , his was XML and Java .
His first order of business was to whistle up a Visual Basic for Applications script that would export the workbook to XML .
From there , he wrote another script that would generate the appropriate configuration files for Struts in Java .
His work done , he moved along to another project leaving some impressive presentations that delighted the customer immensely .
Implementation being an obvious slam dunk , the company put a few people on the project more - or - less part time while they completed the final easy stages of other delivery projects .
Thanks to the company ’s signature up - front analysis and rigid waterfall model , they were confident that customer UAT and delivery into production on other projects would not generate any meaningful bugs or requirements changes , so the resources would have plenty of time for this new project .
But just to be sure , they hired the New Guy ( not to be confused with the New Girl ) .
The New Guy had a lot of New Ideas .
Generally , his ideas fit into one of two categories :
Some were sound but unworkable in the company ’s environment , and the others were unsound and still unworkable in the company ’s environment .
His early days were marked by attempts to hook up his own wifi so he could surf on his shiny new Tablet PC during meetings , attempts to disconnect the loud pager that would interrupt all programming in the cubicle farm whenever the receptionist was paging a salesperson , and attempts to get the project to fix all bugs on completed features before moving on to write new features .
When he saw the design of the system , he immediately grasped its deepest flaw : Changes to business requirements in the Excel workbook could cause problems at run time .
For example , what if some business logic in Java was written for a Struts action that vaporized when a business rule was rewritten ?
Today , we can sympathize with his obsession .
He was deeply discouraged by the company ’s insistence that development run at full speed developing new features with the actual business of making the features work deferred to UAT at the end of the project .
One developer claimed that she had a working dynamic web page switching back and forth between English and Inuktitut , but the English version was generated by a JSP backed by a stub class and the Inuit version was actually a static HTML page .
Management gave this a green light to be considered “ feature complete ” after the customer failed to ask any pertinent questions during the Friday - afternoon - after - a - heavy - steak - lunch - and - before - a - long - weekend demonstration Depressed and quite pessimistic about the team ’s ability to orchestrate Java development in parallel with the rapid changes to the workbook , he came up with the solution : a series of XSLT files that would automatically build Java classes to handle the Struts actions defined by the XML that was built by visual basic from the workbook that was written in Excel .
Then , any changes that were not properly synchronized with the Java code would cause a compiler error , and the team would be forced to update the Java code immediately instead of hand waving things .
The New Guy ripped his phone out of its socket , ignored all emails , and worked around the clock .
When management came looking for him , he hid in vacant conference rooms , feverishly tapping away on his tablet .
A few days later , he emerged triumphantly with his working build system .
Saving a change to the excel workbook automatically generated the XML , which in turn automatically generated the Java classes and rebuilt the entire application , along with regenerating the database tables in a style what would presage Rails migrations .
He presented this nightmare of dependencies and fragile scripts to management and waited for the response .
They had shot down every single one of his ideas without exception , and now he was promoting a daring scheme that owed its existence to the proposition that their management style was craptacular .
But he was a man of principle , and was committed to do the right thing in the face of any opposition .
Management wasted no time in responding .
Brilliant !
He was obviously far too valuable a resource to waste time on implementation .
He was promoted to a junior Architect role where he could deliver demonstrations to clients .
His very first job ?
To write a white paper explaining the new technology .
Expecting to get the axe , he was shocked by their warm reception .
He had failed to realize that management was indifferent to the idea ’s actual development value , but had a keen sense of what played well with clients in Enterprise environments .
These companies lived and breathed integration between wildly disparate technologies , many of which did n’t work , had never worked , and never would work .
I suspect this is typical of Mouse Trap architectures everywhere .
Built with the best of intentions , they survive for reasons their creators could never have anticipated .
The company adopted the new build scripts immediately and assigned a junior programmer who was working on several other projects to maintain them .
Within months they had been dismantled , in no little part because the team hated the idea that every time the business analyst changed the business rules , their Java code that was carefully constructed for a previous version would stop compiling .
The New Guy lasted a few months longer before realizing that his sudden accord with management was illusory , and that nothing really had changed .
He has now forsworn his love for static typing and is now wandering a production Ruby code base muttering about software development the way the demented wander the streets muttering about government conspiracies .
All that remains of his work are a few XSL files somewhere , like old game pieces that are rolling around the bottom of a drawer at the cottage hoping that someone will open a bottle of wine and call for a game of Mouse Trap to pass the time .
Dr Who
Dr Who
The Nature of the Infection
The years pass , and the arguments go back and forth over whether watched fiction actually has an effect on the reader or the viewer .
Does violent fiction make a reader violent ?
Does frightening fiction create a watcher who is frightened , or desensitised to fear ?
It ’s not a yes , or a no .
It ’s a
yes but
.
The complaint about Dr Who from adults was always , when I was small , that it was too frightening .
This missed , I think , the much more dangerous effect of Dr Who : that it was viral .
Of course it was frightening .
More or less .
I watched the good bits from behind the sofa , and was always angry and cheated and creeped out by the cliffhanger in the final moments .
But that had , as far as I can tell , no effect on me at all , as I grew , the fear .
The real complaint , the thing that the adults should have been afraid of and complaining about was what it did to the inside of my head .
How it painted my interior landscape .
When I was three , making Daleks out of the little school milk bottles , with the rest of the kids at Mrs Pepper ’s Nursery School , I was in trouble and I did n’t know it .
The virus was already at work .
Yes , I was scared of the Daleks and the Zarbi and the rest .
But I was taking other , stranger , more important lessons away from my Saturday tea - time serial .
For a start , I had become infected by the idea that there are an infinite number of worlds , only a footstep away .
And another part of the meme was this : some things are bigger on the inside than they are on the outside .
And , perhaps , some people are bigger on the inside than they are on the outside , as well .
And that was only the start of it .
The books helped with the infection – the Dalek World one , and the various hardcovered Dr Who Annuals .
They contained the first written SF stories I had encountered .
They left me wondering if there was anything else like that out there ...
But the greatest damage was still to come .
It ’s this : the shape of reality – the way I perceive the world – exists only because of Dr Who .
Specifically , from The War Games in 1969 , the multipart series that was to be Patrick Troughton ’s swan song .
This is what remains to me of The War Games as I look back on it , over three decades after I saw it :
The Doctor and his assistants find themselves in a place where armies fight : an interminable World War One battlefield , in which armies from the whole of time have been stolen from their original spatio - temporal location and made to fight each other .
Strange mists divide the armies and the time zones .
Travel between the time zones is possible , using a white , boxlike structure approximately the same size and shape as a smallish lift , or , even more prosaically , a public toilet : you get in in 1970 , you come out in Troy or Mons or Waterloo .
Only you do n’t come out in Waterloo , as you ’re really on an eternal plane , and behind it all or beyond it all is an evil genius who has taken the armies , placed them here , and is using the white boxes to move guards and agents from place to place , through the mists of time .
The boxes were called SIDRATs .
Even at the age of eight I figured that one out .
Finally , having no other option , and unable to resolve the story in any other way , the Doctor – who we learned now was a fugitive – summoned the Time Lords , his people , to sort the whole thing out .
And was , himself , captured and punished .
It was a great ending for an eight - year old .
There were ironies I relished .
It would , I have no doubt at all , be a bad thing for me to try and go back and watch The War Games now .
It ’s too late anyway ; the damage has been done .
It redefined reality .
The virus was now solidly in place .
These days , as a middle - aged and respectable author , I still feel a sense of indeterminate but infinite possibility on entering a lift , particularly a small one with white walls .
That to date the doors that have opened have always done so in the same time , and world , and even the same building in which I started out seems merely fortuitous – evidence only of a lack of imagination on the part of the rest of the universe .
I do not confuse what has not happened with what cannot happen , and in my heart , Time and Space are endlessly malleable , permeable , frangible .
Let me make some more admissions .
In my head , William Hartnell was the Doctor , and so was Patrick Troughton .
All the other Doctors were actors , although Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker were actors playing real Doctors .
The rest of them , even Peter Cushing , were faking it .
In my head the Time Lords exist , and are unknowable - primal forces who cannot be named , only described : The Master , the Doctor , and so on .
All depictions of the home of the Time Lords are , in my head , utterly non-canonical .
The place in which they exist cannot be depicted because it is beyond imagining : a cold place that only exists in black and white .
It ’s probably a good thing that I ’ve never actually got my hands on the Doctor .
I would have unhappened so much .
A final Dr Who connection – again , from the baggy - trousered Troughton era , when some things were more than true for me – showed itself , in retrospect , in my BBC TV series , Neverwhere .
Not in the obvious places – the BBC decision that Neverwhere had to be shot on video , in episodes half an hour long , for example .
Not even in the character of the Marquis de Carabas , who I wrote – and Paterson Joseph performed – as if I were creating a Doctor from scratch , and wanted to make him someone as mysterious , as unreliable , and as quirky as the William Hartnell incarnation .
But in the idea that there are worlds under this one , and that London itself is magical , and dangerous , and that the underground tunnels are every bit as remote and mysterious and likely to contain Yeti as the distant Himalayas was something , author and critic Kim Newman pointed out to me , while Neverwhere was screening , that I probably took from a Troughton - era story called “ The Web of Death ” .
And as he said it , I knew he was spot on , remembering people with torches exploring the underground , beams breaking the darkness .
The knowledge that there were worlds underneath ... yes , that was where I got it , all right .
Having caught the virus , I was now , I realised with horror , infecting others .
Which is , perhaps , one of the glories of Dr Who .
It does n’t die , no matter what .
It ’s still serious , and it ’s still dangerous .
The virus is out there , just hidden , and buried , like a plague pit .
You do n’t have to believe me .
Not now .
But I ’ll tell you this .
The next time you get into a lift , in a shabby office building , and jerk up several floors , then , in that moment before the doors open , you ’ll wonder , even if only for a moment , if they ’re going to open on a Jurassic jungle , or the moons of Pluto , or a full service pleasure dome at the galactic core ...
That ’s when you ’ll discover that you ’re infected too .
And then the doors will open , with a grinding noise like a universe in pain , and you ’ll squint at the light of distant suns , and understand ...

There are too many introductions to things on my hard drive , and I thought I 'd pull a few of the uncollected ones out , mostly for books that are now out of print .
I 'm off today to Holly 's graduation .
It was n't that long ago as these things go that I was blogging about how she was going to college and what we did the week before .
Anyway , a few introductions in the weeks to come .
This is from an introduction to a Paul McCauleynovella that Telos published in 2003 , " Eye of the Tyger " , a few years before the current team revivedso very well .

The question goes deep into the heart of monetary policy .
Two articles from the August 2005 issue of Econ Journal Watch point to confusion over even the terms that are used to describe ostensibly free - market policies , the " gold standard " and " free banking . "
The articles trace the history of these terms and how monetary policy changed their operational meaning .
How these terms are defined plays a central role in economic analysis and how that analysis translates into actual public policy .
In " Gold Standards and the Real Bills Doctrine in U.S. Monetary Policy , " Richard Timberlake ( 219 –227 ) details how the gold standard has been blamed for the Great Depression and the liquidity crunch that preceded it .
But , Timberlake argues that the " gold standard " that was in effect at the time bore little resemblance to the ideal of the gold standard .
Economists conflate the effects of the regulatory apparatus with the gold base itself .
" The profession is , therefore , working with fundamentally flawed historical analysis , and the general public is still misinformed and bewildered " ( 219 ) .
Ben Bernanke contributed to the confusion .
He wrote in a book review ,
Eichengreen has made the case that the international gold standard , as reconstituted following World War I , played a central role in the initiation and propagation of the worldwide slump … [ it is ] a powerful indictment of the political and economic policy - makers who allowed themselves to be bound by golden fetters while the world economy collapsed .
( 223 )
But , as Timberlake notes , Bernanke himself was puzzled by the fact that the pre–World War I gold standard was quite stable ( 224 ) .
Timberlake ( 225 ) answers that the " interwar gold standard was not a gold standard .
It was an entirely different system than the pre-1914 gold standard that had existed for 100 years .
Timberlake brings in Leland Yeager to make the case : " The gold standard of the late 1920s was hardly more than a façade .
It involved extreme measures to economise on gold …
It involved neutralization or offsetting of international influences on domestic money supplies , incomes , and prices .
Gold standard methods of balance - of - payments equilibrium were largely destroyed … "
In other words , it was Fed policy , not the gold standard that precipitated the Depression .
By contrast , Timberlake ( 199 ) explains how a pure gold standard should function :
A true gold standard is a complete commodity - money system and , therefore , has an appeal not found in some other monetary arrangements .
Under an authentic gold standard , the demand for , and supply of , money react simultaneously , through market prices for all goods and services and the monetary metal , to determine a given quantity of money .
If prices of all goods and services and capital tend to fall , say , because of an increased demand for common money , the value of monetary gold being fixed in dollar terms rises in real terms , stimulating increases in the production and importation of gold , and the supply of gold to the mints .
Since gold is the necessary base for currency and bank deposits , the quantity of common money also increases arresting the fall in market prices .
Alternatively , when additional gold enters the monetary system from whatever source , it tends to raise money prices .
Offsetting the potential price level increase are the nominal increases in goods , services , and capital that normally occur .
In either case , successive approximations of goods production and money production through the market system generate an ongoing monetary equilibrium .
This is in contrast to the monetary policy embraced by the Fed , which did not allow the supply of money to find equilibrium with the market .
Being clear about the definitions of the term " the gold standard " would allow economists ( and the public ) to properly discuss a complex subject like monetary policy .
If it were recognized that " the gold standard " was not in effect in the buildup to the Great Depression , would policymakers and the public be so wary of the concept today ?
Ignacio Briones and Hugh Rockoff investigate the larger question of free banking in their article , " Do Economists Reach a Conclusion on Free- Banking Episodes ? "
Like " the gold standard , " they find that the term " free banking " has been used to describe monetary systems which had various levels of freedom from regulation , but none of which was totally free from government tinkering ( 315 ) .
None achieved the total free market in money envisioned by Hayek , which the authors ( 280 ) describe thusly :
Hayek imagined a system in which governments steered completely clear of money .
The government would not define the basic legal tender or even the basic unit of account .
Money would be completely " denationalized . "
Hayek imagined private firms issuing competing monies in units of their own choosing : Mengers , Ducats , Florins , Talents , and so on ( 1978 , 53 ) .
In principle , these issuers could ( and Hayek thought would ) issue pure fiat monies — paper monies unbacked by any promise to pay in gold , silver , or other commodities .
What would prevent them from overissuing , that is from simply adding zeros and collecting the seignorage ?
The reputation of the issuer would be enough , Hayek argued , to prevent overissue .
If the government overissues a monopoly legal tender , the usual cause of inflation , there is little that the ordinary person can do .
But in Hayek 's world a brand of money that was depreciating in terms of commodities would be abandoned in favor of another brand that was not depreciating .
Private competition , in other words , would solve the problem of inflation .
Briones and Rockoff ( 282 ) tell us that Adam Smith favored a more restricted " free banking " system , where the banks would be prevented from issuing small denomination bank notes , and , for the large denominations , they would be required to convert these bills into gold - backed currency on demand — effectively tying bank currency to the gold standard .
But the banks would be otherwise free .
They survey " free banking " episodes in Scotland , the United States , Canada , Sweden , Switzerland , and Chile .
Each occurrence of this relatively freer banking differed in several variables : freedom to issue bank notes , freedom to lend , freedom of entry , and freedom from regulation by ( or help from ) a central bank .
Of their analysis , they write :
One would like to arrange cases of free banking on a continuum ranging from total freedom to total regulation .
Any such arrangement , however , will be somewhat arbitrary .
In the American case banks were highly restricted , for example , in terms of the assets they could hold , but they were free to issue shares with limited liability and were free of any oversight by a central bank .
In the Scottish case , banks enjoyed far more freedom in terms of assets they could hold , but their liability was unlimited …
Comparing these cases inevitably requires judgments about how important various restrictions were in practice ( 289 ) .
While some academics have attempted to paint free - banking episodes as " wild cat " skullduggery , with fraudulent opportunists circulating worthless paper and avoiding the regulators , Briones and Rockoff ( 315 ) suggest that these cases were not the norm and that in fact the relatively " free banking " was also relatively good banking .
They conclude :
It appears that wildcat banking , if it existed at all , was at most a very rare phenomenon .
Some of the few cases of overissue and wildcat banking that have been reported resulted from legislation that undermined the ability of the public to distinguish among the notes issued by individual banks …
A lot of very good banking was done in lightly regulated banking systems …
Evidently , there were a variety of lightly regulated banking systems that could serve as models for sound banking systems …
The story of free banking , moreover , provides a cautionary tale about judging the regulation of banking on the basis of anecdotes rather than evidence .
So , in both cases of the " gold standard " and " free banking " we find that much of the case against the free - market policy is based on misrepresentations of the policies and semantic subversion .
This sort of equivocation by economists ( who should know better ) extends well beyond the gold standard and free banking .
In another EJW article , Kurt Schuler describes how American economists incorrectly labeled Argentina 's monetary policy a " currency board " and how this led them to offer erroneous advice about how to fix the economic downturn in that country .
He notes that journalists ( and their editors ) who spread these predictions can't be expected to catch the analytical mistakes and that this is essentially a charge for economists .
As we pursue more liberty - respecting government , we need to insist that our intellectual adversaries not get away with painting cartoon caricatures of central concepts .

These sedentary rock creatures are yet another race that makes the crew of the Enterprise fight with archaic weapons to prove some nebulous point .
They create the illusion of Abraham Lincoln , or turn into Abraham Lincoln , or re-create Abraham Lincoln or something .
It does n't really matter – the important thing is Space Lincoln !
Powers : Matter control and manipulation , making guys fight .
Weaknesses : None , unless you count the phenomenon that one of them apparently changed into Abraham Lincoln and got killed by a pointy stick .

It promised to be a very good year .
But then anything would be better than 1967 , with its angry kids burning the flag , and the war raging , and American cities going up in flames one after another .
A Page 1 headline in The New York Times said : “ World Bids Adieu to a Violent Year . ”
It seems impossible that 1968 , the most incredible year of a most incredible decade , was 40 years ago .
As the new year tiptoed in , Americans wrapped themselves as usual in the comfort of optimism .
Snow fell on the revelers in Times Square .
A threatened New York City subway strike was averted and the 20 - cent fare maintained .
No one had a clue about what was in store .
A friend of mine , looking back , said , “ Sixty - eight was the whirlwind . ”
It was a presidential election year , and The Times reported on Jan. 1 that G.O.P. leaders believed that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York was the only Republican who could defeat Lyndon Johnson .
Richard Nixon might give the president a good run , they said , but would probably lose .
Ronald Reagan and the governor of Michigan , George Romney , would most likely lose decisively .
Swedish police are probing a malodorous fermented flying fish incident in which an open can of local delicacy surströmming was launched through the bedroom window of a 52 - year - old Motala man .
Sweden 's
The Local describes the result as " breakfast in bed with a cruel and unusual twist " , and according to our correspondent Mike Richards that pretty well sums it up , since he categorises the smell of surströmming as akin to " composted gorgonzola in a Viking 's jockstrap " .
The cops are treating the piscine projectile launch as " property damage " , and reckon they have a pretty good idea who was responsible .
For the record , surströmming comprises fermented Baltic herring which are brewed " in - the - can " , allowing bacteria to work their magic and produce the distinctive odour .
The tins are apparently banned by some airlines , since they may pose an explosive risk .
Mercifully , al - Qaeda is unlikely to avail itself of this property to down aircraft because , according to Mike , you have to be " clinically Swedish " to even look at a can of the stuff without fainting . ®

Thanks to the commentator who pointed us in the direction of this vid demonstrating what happens when Brits confront a can of surströmming .

Emmanuel Mgaya 's family say they will not sue the hospital
Emmanuel Mgaya , 19 , died hours after the surgery , performed two weeks late .
Meanwhile , Emmanuel Didas , 20 , who had brain surgery although his complaint was in the knee , is slowly recovering but he remains partially paralysed .
The government has apologised for the mix - up , which has been blamed on both men having the same first name .
Mr Didas cannot move his right side following the unnecessary operation .
He told the BBC in hospital that he was able to eat his favourite food again - maize meal with fish and vegetables .
Health Minister David Mwakyusa said a commission has been set up to investigate the saga and pledged to send Mr Didas to India for specialised treatment .
He originally hurt his leg in a motorbike accident .
No lawsuit
Mr Mgaya was also due to have treatment in India but died before this was possible .
He spent four days at the Muhimbili hospital 's intensive care unit Dar es Salaam but his condition got worse on Thursday .
He was operated on but died several hours later .
His family say they are not planning to sue the government - they always knew he only had a 50 % chance of survival , as the tumour had grown so large .
He first sought medical treatment , complaining of migraines .
But they have urged the health ministry to employ qualified and compassionate medical staff .
Spencer at TPMmuckraker finds a gem in today 's report .
In September 2004 , Gen. David Petraeus wrote in a WaPo op -ed of the security forces he was in charge of training :
Helping organize , train and equip nearly a quarter - million of Iraq 's security forces is a daunting task ....
Now , however , 18 months after entering Iraq , I see tangible progress ....
The institutions that oversee them are being reestablished from the top down .
And Iraqi leaders are stepping forward , leading their country and their security forces courageously in the face of an enemy that has shown a willingness to do anything to disrupt the establishment of the new Iraq .
Here 's Rep. Eliot Engel getting Gen. Petraeus to address that op -ed .
" I stand by it , " says Petraeus , which is consistent on his part , if nothing else .
Even Michael O'Hanlon has to distance himself from this one :
Some of Petraeus ’s critics will argue , as they already have , that he wrote an oped in the fall of 2004 that was too optimistic about the training of Iraqi Security Forces then — and too closely timed to the American elections that November .
To them , that suggests he was and is acting as an agent of White House spin .
That oped may in retrospect have been somewhat too optimistic .
. . .
Ya think ?
If Gen .
Petraeus is unwilling to admit , three years later , that he was wrong , how could we possibly trust his report today to be accurate .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Middle age is truly miserable , according to a study using data from 80 countries showing that depression is most common among men and women in their forties .

The British and U.S. researchers found that happiness for people ranging from Albania to Zimbabwe follows a U - shaped curve where life begins cheerful before turning tough during middle age and then returning to the joys of youth in the golden years .
Previous studies have shown that psychological well - being remained flat throughout life but the new findings to be published in the journal Social Science & Medicine suggest we are in for a topsy - turvy emotional ride .
“ In a remarkably regular way throughout the world people slide down a U - shaped level of happiness and mental health throughout their lives , ” Andrew Oswald at Warwick University , who co-led the study , said on Tuesday .
The researchers analysed data on depression , anxiety levels and general mental health and well - being taken from some 2 million people in 80 countries .
U -SHAPED PATTERN
For men and women the probability of depression slowly builds and then peaks when people are in their forties -- a similar pattern found in 72 countries ranging from Albania to Zimbabwe , the researchers said .
About eight nations -- mostly in the developing world -- did not follow the U - shaped pattern for happiness levels , Oswald and his colleague David Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the United States wrote .
“ It happens to men and women , to single and married people , to rich and poor , and to those with and without children , ” Oswald said .
“ Nobody knows why we see this consistency . ”
One possibility may be that people realize they wo n’t achieve many of their aspirations at middle age , the researchers said .
Another reason could be that after seeing their fellow middle - aged peers begin to die , people begin to value their own remaining years and embrace life once more .
But the good news is that if people make it to aged 70 and are still physically fit , they are on average as happy and mentally healthy as a 20 - year old .
“ For the average persons in the modern world , the dip in mental health and happiness comes on slowly , not suddenly in a single year , ” Oswald said .
“ Only in their fifties do people emerge from this low period . ”

“ No Sandlin property , no bill , ” the Congressman allegedly said in 2005 , meaning he would block the bill if Mr. Sandlin were not included in the profitable deal .
The deal netted Mr. Sandlin some $ 4.5 million , prosecutors say .
Mr. Sandlin , who was also indicted on the extortion , fraud , money - laundering and conspiracy charges , was a heavy contributor to Mr. Renzi ’s first campaign in Arizona ’s First Congressional District , in 2002 .
The indictment said that Mr. Renzi and Mr. Sandlin concealed at least $ 733,000 that the Congressman took for helping the lucrative land deal go through .
“ Congressman Renzi misused his public office by forcing a land sale that would financially benefit himself and a business associate , and in so doing , he betrayed the trust of the citizens of Arizona , ” said the United States attorney for Arizona , Diane J. Humetewa .
A lawyer for Mr. Renzi , Kelly Kramer , disputed that description of events , telling The Associated Press that the Congressman had done nothing wrong .
“ We will fight these charges until he is vindicated and his family name is restored , ” the lawyer said .
Mr. Renzi and another defendant , Andrew Beardall , 36 , of Rockville , Md. , are also accused of embezzling more than $ 400,000 in premiums from an account in an Arizona insurance business owned by the Renzi family to help finance Mr. Renzi ’s first Congressional campaign .
“ Essentially , the indictment alleges two courses of criminal activity and conduct , ” Ms. Humetewa said at a news conference .
" First , that Congressman Rick Renzi embezzled funds from his own insurance company ’s trust accounts , and he used those funds to finance his first congressional campaign in 2001 and in 2002 .
And acting together , he and Andrew Beardall conspired to get out from under billing statement and state regulatory acts , and in so doing , they made false statements and misrepresentations to regulatory agencies . ”
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen waves during lunch at the Allen and Co. conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Idaho , July 12 , 2007 .
A venture led by Allen has applied to bid in an upcoming U.S. auction of coveted wireless airwaves , according to auction documents released late on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Rick Wilking
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A venture led by Microsoft Corp MSFT.
O co-founder Paul Allen has applied to bid in an upcoming U.S. auction of coveted wireless airwaves , according to auction documents released late on Tuesday .
Allen was listed with an entity called Vulcan Spectrum LLC among the applicants who filed to bid in the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) auction of 700 - megahertz spectrum , which is scheduled to begin on January 24 .
Allen heads an investment company called Vulcan Capital and is also a majority shareholder in U.S. cable operator Charter Communications CHTR.O .
Allen and Vulcan Spectrum were on a list of scores of potential bidders who filed applications ahead of a December 3 FCC deadline .
The list was made available on the FCC ’s Web site late on Tuesday .
The auction applicants also included , as expected , Internet leader Google Inc GOOG.O and U.S. wireless providers AT&T Inc T.N and Verizon Wireless , a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L.
Also listed was Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O .
A Reuters search of the documents did not turn up any application by EchoStar Communications Corp DISH.O .
There was speculation earlier this month that the satellite television operator might apply to enter the auction .
Representatives of EchoStar could not be reached for comment .
The FCC - run wireless auction is expected to take several weeks , with the spectrum to be auctioned off in several blocks .
The radio waves are being returned by broadcasters as they move from analog to digital signals early in 2009 .
The signals can go long distances and penetrate thick walls .
The auction is seen as a last opportunity for a new player to enter the wireless market .
Google and other Silicon Valley leaders see the wireless spectrum as a way to create more open competition for mobile services and devices than those available on existing networks .
This optimism was most evident among new employees , the report found , and it was bound to show up on days when Google stock had climbed .
This discovery largely jibes with what experts have found about the entrepreneurial mindset .
If you take a job where much of the reward will come from the appreciation of company stock , you tend to see the silver lining within the cloud .
( What is striking is that this bias was detected at Google during its greatest period of success .
The stock more than tripled in the two - and - a - half - year period being studied , yet it was still possible to be too bullish about the company . )
Beyond its findings , the report is fascinating for its inadvertent peeks into the secretive world of Googleland .
One learns , for example , that the researchers could determine “ physical proximity ” by using “ data on the precise latitude and longitude of employees ’ offices ”  the better to find the closest burrito stand using Google Earth , I guess .
Also , the authors report that “ employees moved offices extremely frequently ” during the time they were studying the company , about once every 90 days .
“ You walk into their offices and no one packs from their moves , ” Mr. Zitzewitz said , a sign , he said , that Google was acting on the kind of insights the report described and was putting the right people next to one another .
A question never addressed in the report is what would seemingly be most interesting to an outsider :
Do prediction markets work ?
Unlike surveys , the markets rely on something , I think the technical term is ... oh , yeah , greed , to get their results .
Ask me who I think will win a baseball game , an election and an Oscar , and I can try to be objective , but I ca n’t help being influenced by who I would like to see win .
( The Yankees , Fred Thompson , Pee - wee Herman ; or is it the Yankees , Pee- wee Herman , Fred Thompson ? )
Put $ 5 on it , however , and suddenly I am willing to use all the information I have at my disposal to come up with the best answer .
It was smart of the top Democrats to cut presidential candidate Rep. Dennis Kucinich out of that South Carolina debate , where they lamely attempted to deal with the dire consequences of the banking meltdown without confronting the banks .
They made all the proper concerned noises about millions of folks losing their retirement savings and homes , but none was willing to say what Kucinich would have said : Bankers are crooks who will steal from the public unless the government holds them accountable .
How do I know Kucinich would have said that ?
Because I interviewed him for the Los Angeles Times back when he was mayor of Cleveland and the banks foreclosed on his city after he refused to sell the public power plant .
Others can talk a populist line , but Kucinich lived it .
He was forced out of office that time , but voters realized 10 years later that Kucinich had been right .
Thanks to the public power alternative that Kucinich refused to sacrifice , Cleveland had cheap power , and he was elected to the Ohio Legislature and then to Congress as his reward .
I bring this up now not to push a Kucinich presidential candidacy , which seems quite forlorn given the power of big money and big media to set the stage for permissible political debate , but rather to hold out a yardstick for measuring the “ progressivism ” of the top three Democrats .
Sure , they all would be preferable to their likely Republican alternatives , although Sen .
John McCain has been far better than all three Democrats on both campaign - finance reform and taking on the defense contractors who have been bleeding us dry since 9/11 .
I got a little worried when Sen.
Hillary Clinton said she could do the best job in confronting McCain on national security ; she is shameless in throwing money at war profiteers , while McCain has held the line on some of the more egregiously wasteful military expenditures .
With a military budget that has more than doubled since 9/11 , soaking up trillions of dollars in obligations for future generations , it is stupid to argue about whether the Democrats or Republicans would spend more on needed domestic programs , because the money for those programs will not be available .
Kucinich was the one candidate on the Democratic side willing to do what Rep. Ron Paul has in the Republican debates — challenge the phony patriotism of ripping off the taxpayers for war - fighting expenditures in Iraq and elsewhere , leaving us less secure .
While Paul is very good , indeed the best candidate , on the waste of taxpayer dollars on foreign military ventures , as is expected from a libertarian , he is hostile to the need for government regulation to control the excesses of the marketplace .
And it is those excesses that are at the root of the financial chaos we have visited upon the world .
As with the Enron scandal , which was the direct result of the bipartisan - supported deregulation of the energy industry , so too the subprime mortgage and easy - credit scandals now upon us .
For decades , banking lobbyists have pushed through legislation freeing them to wreak havoc on our lives while they profit from lucrative personal bailouts even as their own companies suffer .
Deregulation became the mantra covering corporate theft in both Republican and Democratic administrations , and it is amazing that not one of her interlocutors at the South Carolina debate asked Sen .
Clinton about her husband ’s signing of the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act of 1999 , which permitted banks , stockbrokers and insurance companies to merge , overturning one of the major regulatory achievements of the New Deal .
More important , both political parties have refused to place any serious restraints on the interest charged by banks and think it perfectly normal , indeed healthful , for the economy that folks are given home loans or credit cards at unrealistically low interest rates calculated to soar after an introductory phase .
What a sorry scene to see the top Democratic contenders unable to agree that some interest rates below 30 percent may rise to the level of usury .
For those unfamiliar with the moral crime of usury , believing it ’s only a legal crime if loan sharks threaten your knee caps , let me quote from Ezekiel 22:12 of the King James Bible : ” …
Thou hast taken usury and increase , and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion , and hast forgotten me , saith the Lord God . ”
Not being overly familiar with Scripture , I am grateful to Kucinich , a product of a stern Catholic upbringing , for having informed me , more than a quarter of a century ago , that the bankers , and the politicians who service them , are courting the wrath of God — even if they fool the voters .
Copyright holders have collectively objected to proposed exemptions to the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) in cases where copyright software causes security and privacy harm .
Lawyers for the pigopolists ( including the Business Software Alliance , Motion Picture Ass. of America and Recording Industry Ass. of America ) also said exceptions that would allow DRM software to be circumvented in hypothetical cases where it " threatens critical infrastructure and potentially endangers lives " might create " uncertainty " in the minds of software developers .
As Ed Felten of Freedom to Tinker puts it , this extraordinary legal argument ( page 21 - 23 ) means copyright holders want to keep their options open about developing DRM software even when there are doubts about whether it might threaten lives or the systems that underpin the US economy .
" In order to protect their ability to deploy this dangerous DRM , they want the Copyright Office to withhold from users permission to uninstall DRM software that actually does threaten critical infrastructure and endanger lives , " Felten writes .
Common sense would dictate that copyright holders would ensure DRM systems pose no risk to critical infrastructure or lives before their deployment , of course , but Felten remains unconvinced good sense will enter into the US Copyright Office 's deliberations on the pigopolists submission .
The proposed exemptions were put forward by the Computer and Communications Industry Association and the Open Source and Industry Association during the US Copyright Office ’s DMCA exemption rule making review process .
" If past rule makings are a good predictor , it ’s more likely than not that the Copyright Office will rule in their favour , " he said . ®
RALEIGH , N.C. --
More than three dozen current and former
Duke lacrosse players claim in a lawsuit they suffered emotional
distress during the furor over the now - discredited rape case
against three of their teammates .
Attorneys planned to file a federal lawsuit Thursday in North
Carolina that accuses Duke University , the City of Durham and
several school and police officials of fraud , abuse , and breach of
duty for supporting the prosecution of the case .
Lead attorney Chuck Cooper said the private university turned
its back on the players to protect the school 's image .
" These young men want an acknowledgment that they were wronged
by institutions and individuals that they trusted to treat them
honestly , " Cooper said in a statement .
" They were victimized by a
corrupt investigation that ignored or suppressed evidence that
would have cleared them . "
The lawsuit filed on behalf of 38 unindicted players and nine
members of their families seeks unspecified damages for invasion of
privacy , emotional distress and other injuries .
Cooper planned to
discuss the lawsuit later Thursday at a news conference in
Washington , D.C .
The players accuse Duke of ignoring , suppressing and
discrediting evidence that proved the players ' innocence , with idly
standing by while the players suffered abuse and harassment on
campus , and with imposing discipline that implied the team was
guilty .
Duke suspended and then canceled the highly ranked team's
season in the wake of the rape allegation .
Duke spokesman Keith Lawrence declined to comment until the
university had time to review the lawsuit .
Durham interim City
Attorney Karen Sindelar did not immediately return a phone call
seeking comment Thursday .
Former Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong won
indictments against Dave Evans , Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann
after a woman accused them of raping her at a team party in March
2006 .
The case unraveled amid the woman 's changing story and lack
of evidence .
The three players were later declared innocent and also have
sued the former prosecutor , the City of Durham and the police
detectives who handled the case .
They reached an undisclosed
financial settlement with the university in June .
Nifong was disbarred and spent a night in jail for his handling
of the case .
Cooper said he is not named in the lawsuit because of
his pending declaration of bankruptcy .
Nifong is claiming more than
$ 180 million in liabilities , almost all tied to the prospect of
losing two other lawsuits stemming from the rape case .
Three other players filed a lawsuit last year , accusing the
school , Nifong and numerous others of a conspiracy that inflicted
emotional distress .

After several weeks of digging , the robbery was over in minutes
Seven men dressed as police came through the cellar wall , tied up staff and made off with some of Damiani 's most valuable pieces in minutes .
Before Sunday 's real - life Italian Job , they had dug for several weeks from a building under construction next door .
Luckily for the showroom , some of its most valuable pieces were on display at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles .
Little trace
Undisturbed , the thieves dug a 3ft ( 1m ) tunnel into the cellar of the jeweller 's showroom .
The seven men , unarmed and unmasked , came through the wall as staff above them prepared the jewels for a celebrity Oscars party .
Tilda Swinton 's Oscar bracelet was reportedly supplied by Damiani
The thieves tied the staff up with plastic cable and sticky tape .
They then locked everyone in the bathroom except the manager , who was taken to the safety deposit room and forced to empty the lockers .
It is reported that Damiani had supplied the diamond - studded bracelet worn by British actress Tilda Swinton , who took the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday .
Although some of the showroom 's jewellery was gracing the red carpet thousands of miles away , there was nonetheless plenty left in Milan .
The real value of the pieces stolen is not yet known as a list is still being compiled .
But it is thought to be millions of pounds worth of gold earrings , necklaces , bracelets and rings - all of them studded with diamonds .
Police say it was an extremely professional job and are working on a theory the gang may have had some inside knowledge .
The thieves made their escape through the same tunnel and police say very little trace was left .
I think we 've reached a tipping point , Ladies and Gentlemen :
“ The National Coalition of American Nuns is impelled by conscience to call you to act promptly to impeach President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for ... high crimes and misdemeanors , ” the group wrote in a letter written on behalf of its board members .
The letter says that impeachment is warranted for their “ deceiving the public under the false pretense that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction ” and “ destroying ” the reputation of the United States and the good will of other nations .
“ The time for impeachment is now — before the example of George W. Bush ’s regime is set in stone , ” they wrote .
“ Future generations will thank you for preserving the freedom of our nation and its relation to the entire human community . ”

I do n't want to preempt my forthcoming coverage ( it probably will go up Sunday night ) of the steadily rising chorus of accusations that Hillary somehow stole the NH election .
But I do want to start a thread about it here for people to post links to resources that I can refer to as I work on the story .
So if you 've been following this closely , feel free to drop into the discussion thread here and tell me what you 're reading and what you think of it .
My goal with this post and with tomorrow 's coverage is not to lend any credence to the charges of election fraud — I believe there are more probable explanations for the upset — but to highlight the major issues that this minor controversy raises about election integrity and what we may have to look forward to in November .
Update : The New Hampshire Secretary of State 's office has announced that they 'll be doing a statewide recount of the primary 's results , citing the Internet controversy ( see below ) over the results .
I also want to add that , contrary to what is being reported at Wired 's " Threat Level " blog , this controversy is very much about electronic voting machines .
I do n't really understand how a writer at an otherwise excellent infosec blog like " Threat Level " could make as elementary an error as equating " e- voting " solely with " paperless touchscreen voting machines , " but it happened .
Memo to Wired and to the rest of the press : optical scanners are " electronic voting machines , " and they are just as vulnerable to hacking and tampering as touchscreens .
See below for more on this .
The problem with New Hampshire
On the subject of election integrity , I want to use this post to highlight a few very important points for the various pundits , bloggers , and other media types who may be working on this story .
First , it is a huge mistake to assume ( like this DKos poster ) that the optical scan machines used in NH are somehow more secure than the much - maligned touchscreen machines , which did n't seem to be that widely used in the primary .
Optical scanners can actually be less secure than touchscreens , because they 're just as easy to tamper with ( sometimes more so ) as the touchscreens , but there 's typically only one per precinct — an attacker therefore has a single point of failure to manipulate .
The fact that optical scanners leave a paper record is totally irrelevant if a random audit of the results is not mandatory by law after every election .
And in New Hampshire , there are no mandatory audits .
As I 've said before , mandating a paper trail without also requiring post-election audits is like buying a security system for your house and then not turning it on .
Ron Paul and his supporters may be a bit loopy ( the recount was ultimately the work of Kucinich , also a loopy man with loopy followers ) , but they are 100 percent correct in insisting on some type of audit of the NH results — not because Hillary hacked the vote ( I currently think there are better explanations for the results than vote hacking ) , but because such audits should always occur as a matter of course .
Again , when you use an electronic voting system , you must audit the results if you want to have confidence in them .
Second , I want to congratulate lefty blog stalwart Josh Marshall on his apparent clairvoyance .
Clearly , he has access to information about the integrity of the NH elections that has been denied to the public .
In a post entitled " Enough , " Marshall decried " the notion that public opinion surveys and even exit poll data is so reliable that any substantial discrepancy between those numbers and the official result is prima facie evidence of tampering .
That is simply absurd . "
He went on insist that " the possibility or danger of tampering is not a license to assume it or imagine it — in the absence of any evidence — any time the vote does n't go how we 'd like . "
I single Marshall out not just because I 'm a daily reader of his blog , but because the attitude exemplified in this post is typical of well - intentioned journalists who do n't really grasp what 's at stake in the e-voting debate .
So let me clarify , for the benefit of Marshall and the others :
In a truly democratic election , the burden of proof is on the state to provide evidence of the election 's integrity .
This sentiment is behind the idea that ballots should be counted under the watchful eyes of the public 's representatives .
So elections are held to a much different standard than criminal proceedings , where the burden of proof is on the one who brings a charge of wrongdoing .
Right now , in the absence of an audit of the New Hampshire results , the state has not met the requirement that it prove to the public that the election was fair .
This is what the fuss is about .
New Hampshire does not have the manual audit requirement that is necessary to prove that an election was fair , so that state 's ballots were effectively counted in secret by closed - source machine code .
When ballots are counted in secret and it's up to the voters to prove that the election was rigged when they 're surprised by the results , that 's not the kind of democracy that the Founders had in mind for us .
Hillary 's New Hampshire woes could be a prelude to a much bigger mess
I 've saved the most important part of this post for last .
Note that this is also the part of the post where I do what folks on the Internet are always wishing that " mainstream " journalists would do , and that 's call it exactly like I see it .
So feel free to disagree , but I think even the small minority of our audience that believes the very worst about Hillary Clinton will have to concede that I have a point about the lay of the land here .
All NH integrity issues aside , the real story in the mini-firestorm stirred up on the Internet in response to Clinton 's NH upset is that it has important implications for the any presidential contest that includes the former First Lady .
Imagine the scene on the day after the November 2008 presidential election if Hillary Rodham Clinton wins the presidency in an upset , after citizens in states like Ohio went to the polls and voted electronically .
If you 're an independent who thinks that the left has made a big deal over the Florida results in the 2000 election , you ai n't seen nothin ' yet .
Over the course of the 90s , segments of the right accused Clinton of a litany of sins that includes the murder of Vince Foster , so it 's not at all a stretch to assume that they could and would add mass electronic election fraud to that line - up .
My point is that given the simple fact of who she is and the feelings that she stirs in her opponents , a close Clinton victory — especially if that victory is at odds with pre- and post- election polling — could precipitate a major electoral controversy to a degree that is not true of any other candidate on either side .
Unlike Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004 , no Republican candidate is likely to roll over and let Clinton take the White House if they can get substantial traction with accusations that she stole the election .
So there 's a small possibility ( or a large one , depending on how you judge the odds of a close Hillary victory ) , that we may be in for a mess that makes us long for the halcyon days of " hanging chads . "
From my perspective , this is what 's really at stake in the ongoing e-voting controversy : the government 's inability to fulfill its obligation to prove to the public that our elections are fair makes our democracy so much more fragile , and so much more susceptible to cracking under the shock of a major election controversy .
Holy Grails of Console Game Collecting – Part 2
| Introduction | Part 1 | Part 2 | Digg It ! |
10 . ) Metal Slug ( Neo Geo ; NTSC-U )
Estimated Price : $ 1000 ( Complete )
Known universally for its hand drawn , over - the - top comic carnage , the original Metal Slug is an amazingly difficult find on the Neo Geo AES .
The US Neo Geo is home to many overpriced rarities , with most of its games costing well over $ 100 each and many more at over $ 500 .
Metal Slug , even though it became increasingly popular , was n’t produced very high quantities by even these standards , and is now valued around $ 1000 .
To put this into perspective , you could for that price buy not only the MVS arcade cartridge of Metal Slug , but the arcade cabinet to play it on .
If you decided on a four slot Neo Geo machine , you could fill the other three slots .
Depending on your game choices , you may even have enough to get a Wii and Metal Slug Anthology , which contains this very Metal Slug and most others as well .
With luck , you could lastly pick up a Neo Geo Pocket ( Color ) and of course , Metal Slug ( First Mission ) .
Tempting as all that is , the Neo Geo fans want it on Neo Geo , and by all accounts they want it more than any other US Neo Geo game .
The only high - priced contestants aiming for its throne are either not as commonly popular ( Stakes Winner ) , or were distributed by less than savory groups who are known to destroy game inserts ( King of Fighters 2000 ) .
Between Metal Slug ’s rarity and its level of desire , the North American Neo Geo fans have on their hands a Holy Grail , and one of the highest quality rarities in gaming .
9. ) Atlantis II ( Atari 2600 ; NTSC-U )
Estimated Price : $ 1000 + ( Complete )
Many collectors consider Atlantis II to be the most difficult - to - acquire game on the Atari 2600 , a system that actually has quite a few rare titles in its library .
This cartridge was never officially released , but rather sent out to players during a competition held by its publisher Imagic .
The tournament , dubbed “ The Great Defend Atlantis Shoot - Off ” , was based on the original Atlantis release and spawned several tiers before pronouncing a winner .
Imagic originally had players send in their Atlantis scores via picture , with the intention of the four highest being flown to Bermuda for the finale .
Atlantis was a popular game however , which meant more than four players achieved a “ perfect ” score where the counter would not reach any higher .
Surprised by this , Imagic had no other choice than to create a new version of Atlantis , specifically for those with a perfect score .
“ Atlantis II ” was then shipped , to separate the great players from the greatest .
With little more than a white “ Atlantis II ” sticker on the box , these games had enhanced speed , were given a lower scoring system , and were made with the intention of abolishing perfect scoring .
Oh , and results were due in two days … that ’d show ’em .
Naturally , Atlantis II is a Holy Grail Almighty today , with the game rarely even displayed in public .
In fact , the game is more often than not sold for a dollar or less , being that its label is identical to the standard Atlantis ; only the gameplay and box ( whose “ Atlantis II ” sticker is unprofessional at best ) are any different .
So the next time you see the “ regular ” Atlantis , take a chance and waste some change , you might just strike gold .
8. ) Virtual Bowling / SD Gundam Dimension War ( Virtual Boy ; NTSC-J )
Estimated Price : $ 1000 + ( Each , Complete )
As you might have noticed from the Games That Defined The Virtual Boy feature , Nintendo ’s 3D experiment console did n’t have an especially extensive library of games due to the quick commercial demise of the system .
Many gamers in the US , however will recall select gaming stores carrying Japanese Virtual Boy games in 1996 , post - apocalypse .
These games were imported due to the abrupt cease of Virtual Boy hardware and software production , and with the few distraught Virtual Boy owners demanding more titles to play .
Given the cheap prices these imports were tagged at , many VB supporters would grab every one they saw , leaving just two titles strangely absent from their otherwise complete collections .
These two very similar and about equally as desired titles , Virtual Bowling and Dimension War are what make collecting for the Virtual Boy near impossible .
Ten years after the Virtual Boy collapse , most of those collectors as well as many new ones , still ca n’t find Virtual Bowling or SD Gundam : Dimension War .
What drives these games to be so expensive is not just their supreme rarity , but since there were only about 30 Virtual Boy titles available worldwide , collectors from every region have attempted to snag each last game for it since it is n’t a very large feat .
Not to be confused with the common Nester ’s Funky Bowling for the North American Virtual Boy , Virtual Bowling is an original title , and almost never seen boxed .
As the name suggests , its a bowling title , this one being story driven and viewed in first - person .
Dimension War is based on the popular Gundam anime series ’ and is a standard turned - based strategy game .
Aimed at younger players , the game ’s difficulty is markedly easier than others of the genre .
As with Virtual Bowling , a boxed copy of Dimension War is a near impossible find for under $ 1000 .
While collectors situated only on North American Virtual Boy releases will tell tales of hunting Jack Bros. , the aforementioned pair of games are the Holy Grails , regardless of region , for Nintendo ’s much neglected red-ridden oddity .
7. ) Air Raid ( Atari 2600 ; NTSC-U )
Estimated Price : $ 3500 ( Loose )
The Atari 2600 is still growing in popularity among hardcore retro-gaming collectors and if there is one game that has seen an explosion in price recently , it has to be Air Raid
for the Atari 2600 .
The only game released by the company “ MenAvision ” ( clever ) , Air Raid is quickly gaining the notoriety it needs to become the Holy Grail of Atari collecting .
Two of the most recent sales have reached over $ 3000 , and for the loose cartridge alone .
The game itself is a standard shooter along the lines of Space Invaders .
Much like that Taito classic , in Air Raid you ’re tasked with defending endangered buildings from rapidly lowering space menaces , the primary gameplay difference being that your ship is above and not below said buildings .
Air Raid ’s cartridge is perhaps the strangest looking for the 2600 , disregarding the need for a title and having both a handle and a sky - blue finish .
its this unique image that is likely to remain at the forefront of a collector ’s thoughts , driving the desire to find it extremely high .
its unknown exactly how many copies were printed , but Air Raid ’s rarity suggests that it may have seen the most limited production run of any commercially released Atari 2600 title .
( Be sure not to confuse Air Raid with Air Raiders , an unrelated and very common game also on the Atari 2600 . )
6. ) Stadium Events ( NES : NTSC-U )
Copies Produced : 2000
Estimated Price : $ 1000 + ( complete )
Out of all the commercially sold NES games , Stadium Events is the most rare and in most cases the most realistic goal of NES collectors .
What makes this otherwise standard game so rare , is that just after its release , it was recalled .
As an official third party title , Stadium Events made use of an accessory called the Family Fun Fitness Pad .
It required the player (s ) to run or step rapidly in order to complete each event , not unlike Dance Dance Revolution ’s Pad .
Upon its release , Nintendo decided to grant the game a first party production , recalling the scant initial cartridges that had been sent out .
The game would later become “ World Class Track Meet ” and would be played with Nintendo ’s own controller the “ Power Pad ” .
Both became very common and were boxed - in with many NES consoles .
But Stadium Events , the original anomaly , had snuck out in ever so limited numbers .
2000 copies is believed to have been the total distribution tally , but does n’t consider how many of those were sold prior to Nintendo ’s recall .
Some have suggested that no more than 200 actually made it into NES owners ’ homes .
Boxed copies of Stadium Events have been sold for over $ 1000 , and even loose cartridges are closing in on that cost .
With just under 800 licensed US games for the NES , collectors of this console have already decided upon a grand challenge , and would be willing to pay almost anything to finish off their collection .
For being such a difficult thing to do , its surprising that completing an NES collection is a desire for so many US collectors ; this is likely because of a heavy nostalgia factor and the widespread affinity many people retain for this classic system , Nintendo ’s first .
But for all of the collectors who chase this achievement , they will need Stadium Events , and there are not very many cartridges to go around .
5. ) Bangai-O : Prize Edition ( Sega Dreamcast : NTCS-J )
Copies Produced : 5
Estimated Price : Undetermined
Treasure is known for releasing their masterpieces in low quantities , but Bangai -O : Prize Edition is so rare , I ’d wager most collectors have never even heard of it ; a quick search on the internet will bring up next to no information .
The original issue of the Dreamcast shmup , Bangai - O is actually a cult favorite ( it is one of the best shooters on the Dreamcast ) and demands more cash than your normal Dreamcast game , but it pales in comparison to the rarity and value of this extremely limited edition .
This version of the shooter was given out by Treasure to exactly five people as the top prizes in a Japanese high - score competition .
While the game itself is identical to the original Bangai - O , the Prize Edition can be identified by a sticker on the case declaring itself as a winner ’s trophy .
In the past , two of these games have been sold , both very quietly .
its unknown the price of the first sale , but the most recent was placed in the inventory of an online store for $ 500 , and at that selling point was quickly snatched .
The “ newness ” of this game means that past prices have had nothing to base on , only suggesting that the game was very rare .
Now , with the most interested of collectors turned on to its existence , any future sales would likely break $ 1000 .
Bangai-O : Prize Edition would seem to be on its way to becoming an unbelievable Holy Grail … assuming that any more copies even turn up !
4. ) Pepsi Invaders
( Atari 2600 ; NTSC-U )
Copies Produced : 125
Estimated Price : $ 1200 + ( Complete )
Pepsi Invaders is quite a unique game with a unique story behind it .
The legend of Pepsi Invaders begins in the early 80’s , the waning days of the Atari 2600 .
Around this time ,
Coca Cola held a employee get - together of sorts with the higher - ups to celebrate a victory against their competitor , Pepsi .
So naturally , they made an Atari game to re-imagine the sales figures .
Originally called “ Coke Wins ” , this title was a Space Invaders - themed shooter that had the player fending off the enemy , in this instance , Pepsi .
Following your victory , the game emphatically displays the bold message of “ Coke Wins ” .
Coming without proper packaging , a true label , or any hint of information , this grail ’s victory message was used as its title until a few years ago , when the original developer identified his weird little creation as “ Pepsi Invaders ” .
Legend has it that only 125 copies of this game were given out , however it was n’t necessarily game - lovers who received them , so far fewer are likely to still exist .
( I ’m not sure that many Coke executives bothered to keep a game cartridge around ) .
As a strange game with an even stranger origin , it is naturally an interest for hardcore fans of obscure and quirky games , not to mention for serious collectors .
As a feasibly acquirable game , Pepsi Invaders can perhaps be called the Holy Grail of the Atari 2600 .
( Beware of the reproduction cartridges flooding eBay for $ 50 , which are simply independent re-releases created using the dumped ROM , and worth nowhere near as much as the original . )
3. ) 1990 Nintendo World Championships : Tournament Cartridge ( NES ;
NTSC-U )
Copies Produced : 90
Estimated Price : Around $ 4000
In 1990 , Nintendo famously held a gaming tournament in Los Angeles , California , not unlike the one in the finale of the cult classic film The Wizard .
While admittedly a mainstream competition ( most of us could have won with no problem ) , the event was a high point in Nintendo ’s glamorous reign at the top of the gaming market , and is remembered by many with great enthusiasm .
After its promotion in the popular Nintendo Power and through the Powerfest tour , kids everywhere practiced feverishly in hopes of heading to this event , seeing the wonder of light and sound , playing some Rad Racer , and winning it all .
its easy to understand why the most passionate of gamers today drop thousands of dollars , without any hesitation , to be one of the few people who can hold this timepiece from the event for themselves .
This cartridge , used in the actual tournament , has a monochromatic label and like a lot of EPROM exposed prototypes , has a hole in its casing , but for displaying dipswitches .
The actual game is a timed compilation of three titles , each adjusted for the tournament , and containing a unique scoring system .
Players begin the challenge by completing the first world of Super Mario Bros. , then must finish a quick lap in Rad Racer before taking off to Tetris where the remaining time runs out .
The game then multiplies your Rad Racer and Tetris scores , adds all three results , and lets you know how well you did .
It is hardly a real test of skill by today ’s standards , but it is $ 4,000 worth of score - crunching fun .
While many Nintendo fans tried out for this competition , only 90 proved themselves worthy to be finalists .
Each of those finalists were given a gray edition copy of this 1990 Nintendo World Championships cartridge to take home , and perhaps , to nightmarishly abuse .
One could suspect many of those copies to have been in various accidents or lost , but they still turn up , and continue to reach a higher and higher value .
There ’s a great deal of factors which motivate game collectors to search out this legendary title , and there is always sure to be an insatiably high demand for it .
2. ) Kizuna Encounter ( Neo Geo ; PAL )
Copies Produced : Less than 12
Estimated Price : $ 10,000 + ( Complete )
One of the most rare games on any platform , the PAL version of Kizuna Encounter is the Holy Grail of European game collecting , and also a complete mystery .
A tag - battle fighting game from SNK , the arcade version of Kizuna Encounter is very common , routinely selling for around $ 50 USD .
Also very common is the Japanese AES version of the game , identical in every way to this release , except for the packaging and inserts .
But this version is somehow incredibly rare .
It is unknown exactly how many copies of the PAL version exist , but no
more than five have ever been witnessed sold .
It is also not possible to confirm that this game was commercially released , given what appears to be an inconceivably low production number , and that the existing copies seem to have originated within a close proximity .
The most recent auctions for Kizuna Encounter have ended in the range of $ 12,000 - 13,500 , which is about the highest price of any singular video game in history .
This price , like all others on this list , is relative to the current demand and desire for the title , and may include many secondary factors such as rumors , small - scale bidding wars and over - estimation .
Many collectors believe this game , while certainly a Holy Grail , does not possess the content , history or widespread desire to remain the most expensive for much longer .
For instance , the Nintendo World Championships title is a Mario game ,
a solid and storied part of gaming history , and has a huge demand .
Kizuna Encounter is perhaps a notable title for only PAL Neo Geo collectors .
While currently questionable in many regards , Kizuna Encounter cannot be denied its stature as one of gaming ’s most revered collector ’s items .
It may be central to only a few collectors , but it somehow has achieved a price that not even one - of - a - kind games have ever reached .
You may never encounter it .
1. ) 1990
Nintendo World Championships : Gold Edition ( NES ; NTSC-U )
Copies Produced : 26
Estimated Price : $ 10,000 +
As interesting as it would have been to close this list with a surprise , in the topic of Video Game Holy Grails , there ’s no doing so .
This literally golden game is not the world ’s most rare , and its price may not even be the highest … but gamers everywhere know very well of its existence .
And now , there is absolutely no denying : its desire is furious , its demand is unmatched , and the determination of gamers everywhere to possess this most holy of grails , is a dream - induced phenomenon .
Will you ever get one ?
Unlikely .
Will you ever see one ?
I doubt it .
Will some lucky gamer out there - one day - find one of the remaining carts in the wild ?
its going to happen .
The 1990 Nintendo World Championships : Gold
Edition was the contest prize in one of Nintendo Power ’s monthly promotions .
One grand prize winner and twenty - five equally as fortunate runners - up were each sent a single copy .
The game is virtually identical to the gray tournament edition above , containing the very same collection of timed games .
This version simply has a full color logo , and most poetically , is gold .
What gives this game an incredible dynamic is that while so few copies exist , they were distributed to winners throughout all of North America .
Many rare / prototype games and systems with this low of a production , had their entire allotment sent to or found in a single localized area .
These cartridges we are speaking of could be anywhere …
Making your weekly rounds at the local thrift store , you search through a rack of some newly brought in gold Zelda carts .
“ Two dollars each ?
I ’ll sell these on eBay . ”
You take them home , only there to discover that one of your “ Zeldas ” has a five - digit selling point .
Approaching a yard sale just about to pack up , you spy a lowly box of NES carts .
Seeing your curiosity , the seller explains some of the games , “ Mario , Zelda , oh , Donkey Kong – my favorite … ” before making a dramatic revelation : “ This was from a contest . ” the seller will say , showing you a gold NWC cart .
“ its a fun game , you can have it . ”
Try to stay calm ( i.e. do n’t pee ) : you would n’t want to suggest the game is worth anything .
The 1990 Nintendo World Championships : Gold Edition has become the definition and idea of a Holy Grail .
its every element seems to add to its energy , and in time , it will only become more costly and harder to acquire .
Few people will ever truly complete their NES or Nintendo collections , with this game being the unattainable deity that it absolutely is .
So to the gamers , to the Nintendo fans , to the collectors , dreamers and purists , I wish you good luck .
There are / were 26 of these carts out there .
It may not be easy or happen tomorrow , next year , or in the next ten years , but for those who remain adamant , it could indeed actually happen .
Somewhere and still to this day , the holy grail of game collecting awaits you .

Nicky Hill brings us this information from the Boom Blox session .
Coming straight from the EA session about the development process behind Boom Blox , we thought it would be nice to inform everyone that there was a special “ GDC Easter Egg ” presented at the end of the session .
It seems as though Head Tracking has been worked into the production of Boom Blox .
Some things are unclear as to whether or not you can move around through previously recorded levels that you played through , or if they are custom built levels .
The important thing is that it IS worked into the game and is available .
Things needed by the player would be either LED glasses , or a wireless sensor bar , but by using just that and the controllers the same headtracking effect that we have seen in various online videos will be possible on the Wii .
Update from cortjezter : I ’m including a couple videos … first one is the “ head tracking , ” second is just a couple minutes of footage from the same presentation .
All taken with a small shaky - cam ; I did my best to hold things still , and pardon the terrible audio !
Are you hoping to build “ an elegant weapon , for a more civilized time ” … and in just 10 minutes ?!
On that turbulent Tatooine day when Ol ’
Ben used those words to introduce Luke to his weapon of choice , he was not speaking of the sawed - off shotgun , lead pipe , crossbow , blunderbuss , broad sword , spear , war elephant or even war pig .
No , his elegant weapon traces its roots much further into the past and to a galaxy far , far away .
Though it would ’ve been interesting to watch Obi-Wan present Luke with his father ’s old , trusty war pig ( slightly worse for the wear ) , Kenobi was referring , of course , to the light saber .
These instructions hopefully are so simple ( and I hope , elegant ) that even a Gungan can build one .
It 's not the fanciest light saber in the galaxy , but my goal is to help all you Jedi out there with serious time constraints .
Do it yourself , or do not – there is no ‘ try ’ !
Here 's how to build a light saber .
What kind of light saber do you want ?
Part of the allure of light sabers is their individuality .
Each Jedi constructs a light saber that appeals to him or her – a weapon that reflects a particular Jedi ’s aesthetic sensibility and preferred style of combat .
The light saber of Luke Skywalker , for example , is far different from that of Count Dooku or Darth Maul .
So before you set out to construct a " Star Wars " light saber , remember that there is no universal , cookie - cutter approach .
What do you want your light saber to look and feel like ?
Do you prefer Luke ’s single blade or Darth Maul ’s two ?
Do you want a straight handle like Obi-Wan or a hooked handle of the kind sported by Dooku ?
And how big are you ?
Not all Jedi’s are as tall as Anakin , and as Yoda pointed out , “ size matters not ! ”
But Yoda did construct a light saber that was smaller than others .
If you choose to complete your light saber with a lighted blade , you can also decide what color to make it .
Graflex or plumbing ?
There are two excellent paths toward a splendid light saber handle : the Graflex 3 - Cell or the hardware store piping method .
Some have even made light sabers using stuff you might have around the house , like vacuum cleaner tubing , using saws and other tools .
I 'm going to do something easier .
Acquiring a Graflex 3 - Cell device requires more legwork from you , because it ’s a vintage photographic tool .
A Graflex 3 - Cell flash handle is what powered those old photographic flash bulbs you see in movies and old photo - shoots .
But it just so happens that the handle can be converted to an excellent light saber handle as well , and indeed you ’ll see many converted Graflex handles as light sabers in the movies .
To find a Graflex 3 - Cell , you can visit antique stores or trade shows of antique camera equipment .
You ’ll pay the least amount for one of them in this venue – just do n’t reveal your plans to turn it into a light saber .
Another option is to go online and try finding one either at a site like eBay or through a newsgroup .
Expect to pay more for them this way , however ( you can actually buy them pretty cheaply from the trade shows ) .
Once you ’ve found your handle , it ’s only a matter of gathering more widely available materials and modifying mainly the bottom half of the handle before you start making your own light saber .
Check out the Graflex conversion instructions at Yoda ’s House .
If you can find a Graflex quickly and cheaply , that ’s great .
But for those of us who need a light saber prop for Halloween at the end of the week or something , it may not be a practical approach .
Here ’s what I would suggest when you do n’t have the luxury of time .
All you need is one evening and a way to get to the hardware store .
Here ’s how I built mine in about 10 minutes ... and a few hours ( the Force is not very strong with me , and there was some gluing ) .
Pick up your materials from the hardware store .
Here ’s what you need to pick up for the light saber construction process .
Plumbing pipes ... make it the chrome kind .
Your length and shape of pipes depend on the light saber you plan to build .
For a classic , Luke / Vader saber , you can purchase two ~6 inch pipes , probably 1.5 inches in diameter , and a short connecting pipe .
Your 6 inch pipes should both have a flared end whose lip can be fastened to the shorter connector pipe using end rings .
This means that your short connecting pipe should be threaded at both ends .
One of the 6 inch pipes ideally would have a threaded end as well , so that an end ring can screw onto it to form the top “ emitter ” end of the light saber .
But if , like me , you could n’t find such a pipe , a plain - end will suffice ; you just need to get some heavy - duty adhesive that works on metal , so you can glue an end ring onto it for your emitter .
Your short connector pipe piece can be changed depending on what kind of light saber you want to build .
For a Maul - style double - bladed light saber , simply get a longer connector pipe .
For a Dooku - style one , grab a 45 - degree angled pipe .
make it the chrome kind .

O-rings .
As many as you like ( they ’ll be used to enhance your Jedi grip ! ) .
As you can see , I have 4 O - rings .
Rubber garbage disposal gaskets .
Once again , as many as you like .
I bought three , but ended up only using one for the top emitter end of the light saber .
Many people use thick rubber bands like these for their grip .
Automotive weather - sealing .
This is what I used to make the grip .
There are many kinds of rubber strips that you could use to form the grip and decorate your emitter end .
Doormat rubber and weather stripping work well , for example .
Some people even use adapted bike handlebar grips for their light saber .
Get creative !
A rubber anti-slip pad , the kind used for furniture legs .
This will be the stopper at the butt end of my light saber .
Some people also suggest using a metal sink plug , which would probably be more aesthetically pleasing than my rubber stopper , but if you ca n’t find a sink plug that fits , you can improvise as I did .
Your home improvement store is filled with stuff that could work .
Check out the plumbing , furniture and lighting departments .
D-ring or substitute ring ( like my eye bolt ) and nut .
This will form the belt - clip at the butt end of your light saber , allowing the Jedi to keep his weapon always within arms reach !
It ’s optional ; many Jedi also have deep pockets !
But a purist will tell you that it ’s essential .
If you have a metal stopper at the butt end , you ’ll have to have a drill to get any kind of d-ring or other ring to connect to it .
But if you use a rubber furniture pad like I did , many of them already have a hole drilled into them , so look for a ring that requires only one drill hole and you ’re set !
My stopper had one hole so I found an eye bolt and appropriate nut .
Magnetic tape .
I used this to embellish my light saber .
Things like this allow you to get creative and really personalize your blade .
Adhesive .
Use it for gluing your rubber stripping to the chrome pipes ( if you use weather stripping or my automotive weather seals , these kinds adhere without glue ) .
I also used the glue to seal my end cap onto the emitter pipe and my stopper to the handle - end .
Gloves .
When handling heavy - duty adhesive substances , it 's always a good idea to wear gloves .
Trusty X - acto knife .
You 'll need this sharp tool to cut precision lengths of rubber .
A couple things I decided to leave out : light source , calculator bubble - strip , button .
Primarily I cut all the corners I could in order to make this as fast as possible – if you ’re crunched for time , nobody will fault you for doing the same ( or so I hope ) .
But if you do have time , you can use these and power tools to create an even cooler light saber prop .
Check out the different links throughout this article for more ideas .
Slip the end rings down the long pipes .
They catch on the flared lips and then you can screw them onto the short connector pipe to fasten all three pieces together .
Now you have the beginnings of your handle !
Arrange your O - rings onto your grip as you see fit .
Cut your rubber handle strips to desired length and affix them to your handle .
Be very careful to cut them at an equal length and place them at even increments along the shaft .
Add decorative flare to the light saber .
I split a length of my poofy automotive weather sealing strip in half lengthwise and ran each half along the short connector pipe .
Then I affixed two equal lengths of magnetic tape to the mid-section of the connector pipe to make the entire pipe darker than the two chrome pieces of the light saber .
If you have buttons , calculator bubble strips or other flourishes , this would be a good time to put them on .
Add the emitter - end strip to the top of your handle .
For me , that just involved wrapping one of my disposal gaskets around the top .
Affix ( or screw on ) the end cap at your emitter end .
Secure your belt hook to the stopper .
If you have a metal stopper for the butt - end of your handle , you 'll have to drill your hole now .
Since my stopper already has a hole , I can just insert the eye bolt into the hole and then screw the nut snugly against the inside wall of the stopper .
Plug the handle - end with your stopper .
Mine fit snugly anyway , but I added glue .
Putting the ‘ light ’ back in ‘ light saber ’ .
If you want a light saber that actually lights up ( every wannabe Jedi ’s dream ) , there are ways to achieve this .
Unfortunately , the technology does n’t yet exist for us to create a functional light saber like what we see on the silver screen .
If you want to know how to make a light saber light up , here are your options : Photoshop blade effect ( for onscreen appearance ) :
If you intend for your light saber to be a prop on - screen , then you can use programs like Adobe Photoshop and Fxhome to add the desired effect .
Check out Kin-Char Bamin ’s helpful tutorial .
LED blade ( for in - person appearance ) .
Using a chain of LED lights wrapped in a transparent tube , you can build a light saber that actually lights up !
The only limitation , however , is that the un - lit blade ( as it were ) is always extended ; the only thing your button - control does is light it up or turn the saber - light off .
So you ’ve got a permanently extended blade .
For a Jedi who operates in shadow or under cover of darkness , this effect will be very awe - inspiring .
But for the Jedi who plans to be seen with such a weapon in broad daylight , the elegance that Obi-Wan spoke of may be lost .
Here ’s a great site to check out if you want to learn more about the possibilities of LED in a light saber .
Personally , the Gungan in me was overwhelmed by the electronics involved …
Mee - sa stickin’ to de photoshop approach !
" I see you have constructed a light saber .
Impressive .... most impressive ... "

This appears to be a simple and straightforward concept .
By inquiring more narrowly into its origins and meaning , however , we begin to understand why it has been an ongoing subject of philosophical concern .
It originated in a profound philosophical consideration of the principles of relativity and invariance in the context of Newtonian mechanics .
Further reflections on it , in different theoretical contexts , had extraordinary consequences for 20 th - century theories of space and time .
A “ frame of reference ” is a standard relative to which motion and rest may be measured ; any set of points or objects that are at rest relative to one another enables us , in principle , to describe the relative motions of bodies .
A frame of reference is therefore a purely kinematical device , for the geometrical description of motion without regard to the masses or forces involved .
A dynamical account of motion leads to the idea of an “ inertial frame , ” or a reference frame relative to which motions have distinguished dynamical properties .
For that reason an inertial frame has to be understood as a spatial reference frame together with some means of measuring time , so that uniform motions can be distinguished from accelerated motions .
The laws of Newtonian dynamics provide a simple definition : an inertial frame is a reference - frame with a time - scale , relative to which the motion of a body not subject to forces is always rectilinear and uniform , accelerations are always proportional to and in the direction of applied forces , and applied forces are always met with equal and opposite reactions .
It follows that , in an inertial frame , the center of mass of a closed system of interacting bodies is always at rest or in uniform motion .
It also follows that any other frame of reference moving uniformly relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame .
For example , in Newtonian celestial mechanics , taking the “ fixed stars ” as a frame of reference , we can , in principle , determine an ( approximately ) inertial frame whose center is the center of mass of the solar system ; relative to this frame , every acceleration of every planet can be accounted for ( approximately ) as a gravitational interaction with some other planet in accord with Newton ’s laws of motion .
1. Relativity and reference frames in classical mechanics
1.1 The origins of Galilean relativity
The term “ reference frame ” was coined in the 19th century , but it has a long prehistory , beginning , perhaps , with the emergence of the Copernican theory .
The significant point was not the replacement of the earth by the sun as the center of all motion in the universe , but the recognition of both the earth and the sun as merely possible points of view from which the motions of the celestial bodies may be described .
This implied that the basic task of Ptolemaic astronomy — to represent the planetary motions by combinations of circular motions — could take any point to be fixed , without sacrificing predictive power .
Therefore , as Copernicus suggested in the opening arguments of On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres , the choice of any particular point required some justification on grounds other than mere successful astronomical prediction .
The most persuasive grounds , seemingly , were physical : we do n’t perceive the physical effects that we would expect the earth ’s motion to produce .
Copernicus himself noted , however , in reply , that we can indeed undergo motions that are physically imperceptible , as on a smoothly moving ship ( 1543 , p.6 ) .
At least in some circumstances , we can easily treat our moving point of view as if it were at rest .
As the basic programme of Ptolemy and Copernicus gave way to that of early classical mechanics as developed by Galileo , this equivalence of points of view was made more precise and explicit .
Galileo was unable to present a decisive argument for the motion of the earth around the sun .
He demonstrated , however , that the Copernican view does not contradict our experience of a seemingly stable earth .
He accomplished this through a principle that , in the precise form that it takes in Newtonian mechanics , has become known as the “ principle of Galilean relativity ” : mechanical experiments will have the same results in a system in uniform motion that they have in a system at rest .
Arguments against the motion of the earth had typically appealed to experimental evidence — e.g. , that a stone dropped from a tower falls to the base of the tower , instead of being left behind as the earth rotates during its fall .
But Galileo argued persuasively that such experiments would happen just as they do whether the earth were moving or not , provided that the motion is sufficiently uniform .
( See Figure 1 . ) Galileo ’s account of this was not precisely the principle that we call “ Galilean relativity ” ; he seems to have thought that a system in uniform circular motion , such as a frame at rest on the rotating earth , would be indistinguishable from a frame truly at rest .
The principle was named in his honor because he had grasped the underlying idea of dynamical equivalence : he understood the composition of motion , and understood how individual motions of bodies within a system — such as the fall of a stone from a tower — are composed with the motion of the system as a whole .
This principle of composition , combined with the idea that bodies maintain their uniform motion , formed the basis for the idea of dynamically indistinguishable frames of reference .
Figure 1 : Galileo ’s Argument
If the earth is rotating sufficiently uniformly , a stone dropped from the tower will fall straight to the base , just as a stone dropped from the mast of a uniformly moving ship will fall to the foot of the mast .
In both cases the stone ’s vertical motion will be smoothly composed with its horizontal motion .
Hence a sufficiently uniform motion will be indistinguishable from rest .
1.2 Philosophical controversy over absolute and relative motion
Leibniz , later , articulated a more general “ equipollence of hypotheses ” : in any system of interacting bodies , any hypothesis that any particular body is at rest is equivalent to any other .
Therefore neither Copernicus ’ nor Ptolemy ’s view can be true — though one may be judged simpler than the other — because both are merely possible hypothetical interpretations of the same relative motions .
This principle clearly defines ( what we would call ) a set of reference frames .
They differ in their arbitrary choices of a resting point or origin , but agree on the relative positions of bodies at any moment and their changing relative distances through time .
For Leibniz and many others , this general equivalence was a matter of philosophical principle , founded in the metaphysical conviction that space itself is nothing more than an abstraction from the geometrical relations among bodies .
In some form or other it was a widely shared tenet of the 17th - century “ mechanical philosophy ” .
Yet it was flatly incompatible with physics as Leibniz himself , and the other “ mechanists , ” actually conceived it .
For the basic program of mechanical explanation depended essentially on the concept of a privileged state of motion , as expressed in the common assumption that was the forerunner of the “ principle of inertia ” : bodies maintain a state of rectilinear motion until acted upon by an external cause .
Thus their fundamental conception of force , as the power of a body to change the state of another , likewise depended on this notion of a privileged state .
This dependence was clearly exhibited in the vortex theory of planetary motion , which presupposed that any planet would move in a straight line unless impeded .
Its actual orbit was therefore explained by the balance between the planet ’s inherent centrifugal tendency ( its tendency to follow the tangent to the orbit ) and the pressure of the surrounding medium .
For this reason , the notion of a dispute between “ relativists ” or “ relationists ” and “ absolutists ” or “ substantivalists ” , in the 17th century , is a drastic oversimplification .
Newton , in his controversial Scholium on space , time , and motion , was not merely asserting that motion is absolute in the face of the mechanists ’ relativist view .
He was arguing that a conception of absolute motion was already implicit in the views of his opponents — that it was implicit in their conception , which he largely shared , of physical cause and effect .
The general equivalence of reference - frames was implicitly denied by a physics that characterized forces as powers to change the states of motion of bodies .
This development placed the subject of reference frames in a new theoretical context .
Having set aside the reference frame of common sense — the frame in which the earth is at rest in the center , with the heavens revolving around it — the mechanical physics of this time naturally tied this subject with novel theoretical conceptions of motion , and its physical causes and effects .
Copernicus argued for a heliocentric system , not from a physical theory of motion , but from the comparative simplicity and reasonableness that it introduced into astronomy ; he worked within the established theory of the causes of celestial motions , namely , the revolutions of the heavenly spheres .
After Copernicus , however — more precisely , after the model of revolving spheres was largely abandoned — determining the right frame of reference was connected with discovering the true physical causes of the planets ’ motions .
Philosophers such as Kepler , Descartes , Huygens , Leibniz , and Newton held vastly differing views of physical causation , motion .
and the relativity of motion .
They agreed , however , that the heliocentric picture was uniquely suited for giving a causal account of planetary motions , as the effects of physical actions originating in the sun .
To Kepler and Descartes , for example , the rotation of the sun on its axis , in the same sense in which the planets revolved , identified it as the cause of those revolutions .
The link between the causal account of motion and the more general conceptual account of “ true ” motion was never obvious or straightforward .
Descartes ’s heliocentric causal account , in which the planets moved in vortices arising from the sun ’s rotation , was disconnected from his abstract account of motion “ according to the truth of the matter , ” or “ in the proper sense ” ( Descartes 1642 , part II section XXV ) .
Since there are innumerable objects to which one might refer the motion of any given body , the reference may appear to be a matter of arbitrary choice .
The unambiguous reference for the motion of any body , he argued , is provided by the bodies immediately touching it .
Newton , in response , argued that Descartes ’s philosophical account of motion is flatly incompatible with his causal account .
To Newton , it was incoherent to appeal to a causal account of motion when explaining the centrifugal tendency of a body in its orbit around the sun , while identifying its “ proper ” motion only by its relations to the bodies immediately contiguous to it ( Newton 1684a , Stein 1967 , Rynasiewicz 2014 ) .
Hence Newton ’s argument that the only unambiguous standard of motion is a body ’s change of position with respect to space itself .
To space understood in this sense , as the universal frame of reference with respect to which the displacements of bodies constitute their true motions , Newton gave the name “ absolute space ” ( 1687 b , p. 5 ff ) .
Evidently Newton was aware that “ absolute space ” was not a reference frame in any practical sense .
He emphasized that “ the parts of space can not be seen , ” and that no observable bodies can be known to be at rest .
Hence there is no way to determine motion with respect to space by direct observation ; it must be known by its “ properties , causes , and effects ” ( 1687 b , p. 7–8 ) .
The question arises , then , what properties , causes , or effects indicate a body ’s change of position in absolute space ?
It is conceivable , for example , that there might be some physical correlate for velocity , in the sense that a body might have some observable physical state that depends on its velocity .
It follows , in that case , that a body would be in a distinct physical state when it is at rest in space .
If a body could be known to be in that state , therefore , it would ( in principle ) provide a physical marker for a truly resting frame of reference .
On Leibniz ’s conception of force , for instance , a given force is required to generate or to maintain a given velocity .
For objects “ passively ” resist motion , but maintain their states of motion only by “ active ” force — so that , on dynamical grounds , “ every body truly does have a certain amount of motion , or , if you will , force ” ( Leibniz 1694 , p. 184 ; see also 1716 , p. 404 ) .
It would follow from this that there must be , in principle , a distinguished frame of reference in which the velocities of bodies correspond to their true velocities , i.e. to the amounts of moving force that they truly possess .
It would also follow that , with respect to any frame that is in motion relative to this one , bodies will not have their true velocities .
In short , such a conception of force , if it could be applied physically , would give a precise physical application of Newton ’s conception of absolute space , by providing a physical correlate for change of absolute place .
1.3 Galilean relativity in Newtonian physics
The difficulty with Newton ’s view of absolute space comes , not from the epistemological arguments of relationalism , but from Newton ’s own conception of force .
If force is defined and measured solely by the power to accelerate a body , then obviously the effects of forces — in short , the causal interactions within a system of bodies — will be independent of the velocity of the system in which they are measured .
So the existence of a set of equivalent “ inertial frames ” is imposed from the start by Newton ’s laws .
Suppose that we determine for the bodies in a given frame of reference — say , the rest frame of the fixed stars — that all observable accelerations are proportional to forces impressed by bodies within the system , by equal and opposite actions and reactions among those bodies .
Then we know that these physical interactions will be the same in any frame of reference that is in uniform rectilinear motion relative to the first one .
Therefore no Newtonian experiment will be able to determine the velocity of a body , or system of bodies , relative to absolute space .
In other words , there is no way to distinguish absolute space itself from any frame of reference that is in uniform motion relative to it .
Newton thought that a coherent account of force and motion requires a background space consisting of “ places ” that “ from infinity to infinity maintain given positions with respect to one another ” ( 1687 b , p. 8 –9 ) .
But the laws of motion enable us to determine an infinity of such spaces , all in uniform rectilinear motion relative to each other .
The laws furnish no way of singling out any one as “ immovable space . ”
Oddly enough , no one in the 17th century , or even before the late 19th century , expressed this equivalence of reference - frames any more clearly than Newton himself .
However , the credit for articulating this equivalence precisely for the first time , belongs to Christiaan Huygens , who introduced it as one of the Hypotheses of his first work on the rules of impact ( 1656 ) .
“ Hypothesis I ” was the first clear statement of the principle of inertia : “ Any body , once in motion , if nothing opposes it , continues to move always with the same velocity and along the same straight line ” ( 1656 , pp. 30 –31 ) .
The first precise statement of the relativity principle followed as Hypothesis III :
The motion of bodies , and their speeds equal or unequal , are to be understood respectively , in relation to other bodies which are considered as at rest , even though perhaps both the former and the latter are subject to another motion that is common to them .
In consequence , when two bodies collide with one another , even if both together undergo another equable motion , they will move each other no differently , with respect to a body that is carried by the same common motion , than if this extraneous motion were absent from all of them .
( 1656 , p. 32 ) .
Huygens illustrated this principle by the example of an impact that takes place on a uniformly moving boat , asserting its equivalence to the same impact taking place at rest .
Thus he made precise the argument of Galileo , in light of his more precise understanding of the principle of inertia and the dynamical difference between inertial and circular motion .
Newton ’s first statement of the same principle appears in one of the series of papers that culminated in the Principia , “ De motu sphæricorum corporum in fluidis ” ( 1684 b ) .
Like Huygens , Newton presents the relativity principle as a fundamental principle , “ Law 3 ” :
The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly in a straight line without circular motion .
( 1684 b , p. 40 r )
Newton ’s first statement of the Galilean relativity principle evidently recapitulates Huygens ’ version , which was probably known to Newton .
The same may be said of “ Law 4 ” in this manuscript , the principle of conservation of the center of gravity :
By the mutual actions between bodies their common centre of gravity does not change its state of motion or rest .
( ibid. , p. 40 r )
But , uniquely , Newton immediately went on to consider the deeper theoretical significance of these principles : they radically reconceptualize the problem of “ true motion ” in the planetary system .
First , they implied that the entire system must be seen as included in a space that may , itself , be either at rest or in uniform motion .
Second , they implied that the only truly fixed point in such a system is the center of gravity of the relevant bodies .
This , too , may therefore be in uniform motion or at rest :
Moreover the whole space of the planetary heavens either rests ( as is commonly believed ) or moves uniformly in a straight line , and hence the communal centre of gravity of the planets ( by Law 4 ) either rests or moves along with it .
In both cases ( by Law 3 ) the relative motions of the planets are the same , and their common centre of gravity rests in relation to the whole space , and so can certainly be taken for the still centre of the whole planetary system .
( ibid. , p. 47 r )
Newton now realized , in short , that the dispute between the heliocentric and geocentric views of the universe had been mistakenly framed .
The proper question about “ the system of the world ” was not “ which body is at rest in the center ? ” but “ where is the center of gravity of the system , and which body is closest to it ? ”
For in a system of orbiting bodies , only their common center of gravity will be unaccelerated , and by “ Law 3 ” , the motions of the bodies in the system will be the same , whether its center of gravity is at rest or in uniform rectilinear motion .
By explicitly asserting the dynamical equivalence of “ whole spaces ” that may moving uniformly or at rest , Newton made it clear that the solution to the problem of “ the system of the world ” is the same with respect to any such moving space as it is with respect to immobile space .
Thus he came as close to articulating the concept of the inertial frame as anyone before the late 19th century .
In the successive drafts of his Principia , Newton gradually clarified its conceptual structure , and in particular the frame - independent character of its concepts of motion , force , and interaction .
He arrived at the new axiomatic structure whose only laws are the familiar “ Newton ’s Laws of Motion ” ; the principle of the conservation of the center of gravity , and the relativity principle , were no longer presupposed , but derived from the Laws as Corollaries IV and V :
Corollary IV :
The common center of gravity of bodies does not change its state , whether of motion or rest , by the actions of those bodies among themselves ; therefore the common centre of gravity of all bodies ( external impediments excluded ) rests or moves uniformly in a straight line ( 1687 b , p. 17 ) .
Corollary V : When bodies are enclosed in a given space , their motions among themselves are the same whether the space is at rest , or whether it is moving uniformly straight forward without circular motion ( 1687 b , p. 19 ) .
These principles illuminate the relationship between the theory of absolute space , as articulated in Newton ’s Scholium to the Definitions , and the overarching scientific problem of the Principia .
According to Newton , “ the aim for which I composed ” the book was to show “ how to gather the true motions from their causes , effects , and apparent differences , and conversely , from the motions , true or apparent , to gather their causes and effects ” ( 1687 b , p. 11 ) ; the more specific aim of Book III was “ to exhibit the constitution of the system of the world ” ( 1687 b , p. 401 ) .
On the one hand , Corollary V , like “ Law 3 ” in De Motu , precisely restricts what Newton ’s procedure can determine about the structure of the system of the world .
It cannot determine anything about the velocity of the system as a whole ; it can only determine the position of the center of gravity of the bodies that comprise it , and the configuration of those bodies with respect to that center .
In this sense it can , in principle , decide between a Keplerian and a Tychonic interpretation of the motions of these bodies .
The system is indeed approximately Keplerian : the sun has by far the greatest mass and is therefore little disturbed from the center of gravity by its interactions with the planets .
The sun therefore remains very close to the common focus of the nearly Keplerian ellipses in which the planets orbit the sun .
But by Corollary V , the actions of the bodies among themselves would not reveal whether their center was moving uniformly or at rest .
On the other hand , Newton recognized that motion with respect to absolute space is unknowable .
This restriction , therefore , meant that the solution to the system of the world is secure in spite of our ignorance .
The nearly - Keplerian structure of the system is known completely independently of the system ’s state of motion in absolute space .
The Galilean relativity principle thus contained , in Newton ’s conception , a broader insight : that different states of uniform motion , or different uniformly - moving frames of reference , determine only different points of view on the same physically objective quantities , namely force , mass , and acceleration .
We can see this insight expressed more explicitly in the evolution of Newton ’s concept of inertia .
The term had been introduced by Kepler , and played a central role in his physical conception of planetary motion .
Rejecting the Aristotelian idea that the planets are carried by rotating crystalline spheres , Kepler held that the planets have a natural tendency to rest in space — what he called their natural inertia — and argued that they must be moved by active powers that overcome their natural inertia .
Newton , well before working on Principia , had based his conception of inertia on the idea of Galileo and Huygens , that bodies tend to persist in uniform motion : Inertia , on this new conception , was a resistance to change in motion .
Even so , Newton ’s early understanding of inertia was essentially pre-relativistic , because it implied a conceptual distinction between a body ’s power to resist external forces , and the power of a moving body to change the motion of another .
The manuscript
De gravitatione et aequipondio fluidorum ( 1684a ) , for example , was evidently written before Newton fully recognized the importance of the relativity principle ; here Newton ’s Definitions distinguish “ conatus , ” “ impetus , ” and “ inertia ” as conceptually separate properties :
Definition 6 : Conatus ( endeavor ) is impeded force , or force in so far as it is resisted .
Definition 7 : Impetus is force in so far as it is impressed on another .
Definition 8 : Inertia is the internal force of a body , so that its state may not be easily changed by an external force ( 1684a ) .
Leibniz ( among others ) , as we saw , made a corresponding distinction : moving force , the power of a body to change the motion of another , was determined by velocity .
Leibniz therefore distinguished this force as an active power , fundamentally different from the passive power of a resting body to resist any change of position .
Newton , in contrast , as he developed the Principia , and recognized the existence of a class of indistinguishable relative spaces , gradually came to understand the “ force of inertia ” as what we would call a Galilei - invariant quantity .
Impetus and resistance were therefore recognized as appearances of that invariant quantity in different frames of reference :
A body truly exerts this force only in a change of its state brought about by another force impressed upon it , and the exercise of this force is , under different aspects , both resistance and impetus : resistance in so far as the body , to maintain its state , opposes the impressed force ; impetus insofar as the same body , yielding only with difficulty to the force of a resisting obstacle , strives to change the state of that obstacle .
Resistance is commonly attributed to resting bodies and impetus to moving bodies ; but motion and rest , as commonly understood , are only relatively distinguished from each other ; and bodies commonly seen as resting are not always truly at rest ( 1687 b , p. 2 ) .
There are two noteworthy points about this explication of inertia .
First , it shows that Newton recognized properties that were commonly regarded as distinct ( e.g. in the Leibnizian distinction between passive and active ) as merely frame - dependent representations of the same fundamental property .
That is , they represent the same invariant quantity seen from different points of view .
The principle that a body exerts this force “ only in a change of its state ” decisively separates Newton ’s new view from the older notion of a specific power that is required to maintain a body in motion .
This change has been noted by modern commentators ( see Herivel 1965 , p. 26 ; see also DiSalle 2013 , p. 453 ; Disalle 2017 , in Other Internet Resources ) .
But it was already noted in Newton ’s own time by George Berkeley , who emphasized the contrast between Newton ’s conception and that of Leibniz :
Leibniz confuses impetus with motion .
According to Newton , impetus is really the same as the force of inertia …
( Berkeley , 1720 , p. 80 )
… Experience confirms that primary law of nature by which a body persists equally in a state of motion or of rest as long as nothing external happens from elsewhere to change that state , and on that account the force of inertia appears under different aspects either as resistance or as impetus ; in this sense a body can indeed be called indifferent in its own nature to motion or rest .
( Berkeley , 1720 , p. 92 )
Berkeley thus made clear that the older understanding of inertia , unlike that expressed in the Principia , did not respect the principle of relativity .
Second , Newton ’s explication implicitly invokes all three laws of motion ( cf. Stein 2002 ) .
Newton ’s first law alone came to be identified as “ the principle of inertia . ”
Newton himself , however , understood that inertia has three inseparable aspects : the tendency to persist in motion , the resistance to change in motion , and the power to react against an impressed force .
All are essential to the explication of inertial mass as a measurable theoretical quantity .
To many later commentators , Newton ’s use of the phrase “ force of inertia ” suggested a conceptual confusion .
On the contrary , it was Newton ’s way of drawing attention to the precise role of inertial mass as an invariant quantity in physical interactions , underlying the various ways in which its manifestations had been previously conceived .
1.4
The lingering problem of absolute space
Newton understood the Galilean principle of relativity with a degree of depth and clarity that eluded most of his “ relativist ” contemporaries and critics .
It may seem bizarre , therefore , that the notion of inertial frame did not emerge until more than a century and a half after his death .
He had identified a distinguished class of dynamically equivalent “ relative spaces , ” in any of which true forces and masses , accelerations and rotations , would have the same objectively measured values .
Yet these spaces , though dynamically equivalent and empirically indistinguishable , were yet not equivalent in principle .
Evidently , Newton conceived them as moving with various velocities in absolute space , though those velocities could not be known .
Why should not he , or someone , have recognized the equivalence of these spaces , and the dispensability of a distinguished resting space — “ absolute ” space — immediately ?
This is not the place for an adequate answer to this question , if indeed one is possible .
For much of the 20th century , the accepted answer was that of Ernst Mach : Newton lived in an age “ deficient in epistemological critique . ”
He was therefore unable to draw the conclusion that these dynamically indistinguishable spaces must be equivalent in every meaningful sense , so that no one of them deserves even in principle to be designated as “ absolute space . ”
Yet even those whom the 20th century credited with more sophisticated epistemological views , such as Leibniz , evidently had difficulties understanding force and inertia in a Galilei - invariant way , despite a philosophical commitment to relativity .
We may plausibly suppose that it was difficult to abandon the intuitive association of force or motion with velocity in space .
It must also have been difficult , in the mathematical context of Newton ’s time , to conceive of an equivalence - class structure as the fundamental spatio - temporal framework .
It required a level of abstraction that became possible only with the extraordinary development of mathematics , especially of a more abstract view of geometry , that took place in the 19th century .
Newton ’s arguments established , for the assumptions of classical dynamics , the need for a dynamical space - time structure beyond the kinematical structure required to represent changes of relative position over time .
But absolute space , with its superfluous elements , was the only such structure imagined for the next two centuries .
It was accepted as the only realistic alternative to theories with no dynamical structure at all .
There was as yet no notion of a structure that expressed all and only what was required by the dynamical laws .
Euler , for example , in a penetrating critique of Leibnizian relationalism ( 1748 ) , argued that the laws of motion require a notion of sameness of direction in space , and of uniform motion with respect to time .
The truth of the laws of motion — which , for Euler , were more securely established than any principle of metaphysics — could not , therefore , be reconciled with any account of space and time as merely ideal .
But he did not see the possibility of separating true acceleration and rotation from true velocity with respect to absolute space .
In the 17th century , only Huygens came close to expressing such a view ; he held that not velocity , but velocity - difference , was the fundamental dynamical quantity .
He therefore understood , for example , that the “ absoluteness ” of rotation had nothing to do with velocity relative to absolute space .
Instead , it arose from the difference of velocity among different parts of a rotating body .
If a disk is translated through space without rotation , then its parts move in parallel lines , but if it is rotating , then they move in different directions , even though they are at rest relative to one another on account of the bonds holding them together .
The differences , evidently , would be the same irrespective of the velocity of the body as a whole in absolute space .
Unfortunately , Huygens expressed this view only in manuscripts that remained unpublished for two centuries .
( Cf. Stein , 1977 , pp. 9–10 and Appendix III . )
Huygens also reflected on the possibility of replacing absolute space with ( what we would call ) empirical frames of reference , again in unpublished notes that have only been brought to light in recent work by Stan ( 2016 ) .
But the complete concept of the inertial frame emerged only in the late 19th century , when it did not seem to be of any great immediate importance ( see below ) .
Indeed , even after the concept of inertial frame had been widely discussed , the notion persisted that true rotation could only be understood as rotation with respect to absolute space .
Poincaré , for example , convinced of the essential “ relativity of space ” as well as the relativity of motion , considered the concept of absolute space to be something of a philosophical embarrassment .
But it was not clear to him how the dynamical phenomena of rotation could be understood without it ( cf. DiSalle 2014 ) .
So the failure of Newton and Huygens to formulate the concept of inertial frame , two centuries earlier , seems less remarkable than the progress that each of them made in understanding the relativity of motion .
As we will see , articulating this concept involved synthesizing ( in effect ) insights of Newton , Huygens , and Euler .
1.5 19th - century analyses of the law of inertia
The development of this concept began with a renewed critical analysis of the notion of absolute space , for reasons not anticipated by Newton ’s contemporary critics .
Its starting point was a critical question about the law of inertia : relative to what is the motion of a free particle uniform and rectilinear ?
If the answer is “ absolute space , ” then the law would appear to be something other than an empirical claim , for no one can observe the trajectory of a particle relative to absolute space .
Two quite different answers to the question were offered in 1870 , in the form of revised statements of the law of inertia .
Carl Neumann proposed that when we state the law , we must suppose that there is a body somewhere in the universe — the “ body Alpha ” — with respect to which the motion of a free particle is rectilinear , and that there is a time - scale somewhere relative to which it is uniform ( Neumann 1870 ) .
Ernst Mach ( 1883 ) claimed that the law of inertia , and Newton ’s laws generally , implicitly appeal to the fixed stars as a spatial reference - frame , and to the rotation of the earth as a time - scale .
At any rate , he maintained , such is the basis for any genuine empirical content that the laws can claim .
The notion of absolute space , it followed , was only an unwarranted abstraction from the practice of measuring motions relative to the fixed stars .
Mach ’s proposal had the advantage of a clear empirical motivation ; Neumann ’s “ body Alpha ” seemed no less mysterious than absolute space , and almost sounds comical to the modern reader .
But Neumann ’s discussion of a time - scale was somewhat more fruitful , and employed the principle that Euler had already expressed ( 1748 ) : the law of inertia defines a time - scale , by which equal intervals of time are those in which a free particle travels equal distances .
He also noted , however , that this definition is quite arbitrary .
For , in the absence of a prior definition of equal times , any motion whatever can be stipulated to be uniform .
It is no help to appeal to the requirement of freedom from external forces , since the free particles presumably are known to us only by their uniform motion .
We have a genuine empirical claim only when we state of at least two free particles that their motions are mutually proportional .
Equal intervals of time can then be defined as those in which two free particles travel mutually proportional distances .
1.6
The emergence of the concept of inertial frame
Neumann ’s definition of a time - scale directly inspired Ludwig Lange ’s conception of “ inertial system ” ( Lange 1885 ) .
An inertial coordinate system ought to be one in which free particles move in straight lines .
But any trajectory may be stipulated to be rectilinear , and a coordinate system can always be constructed in which it is rectilinear .
And so , as in the case of the time - scale , we cannot adequately define an inertial system by the motion of one particle .
Indeed , for any two particles moving anyhow , a coordinate system may be found in which both their trajectories are rectilinear .
So far the claim that either particle , or some third particle , is moving in a straight line may be said to be a matter of convention .
We must define an inertial system as one in which at least three free particles move in straight lines .
Then we can state the law of inertia as the claim that , relative to an inertial system so defined , the motion of any fourth particle , or arbitrarily many particles , will be rectilinear .
The notions of inertial system and Neumann ’s time - scale , which Lange called an “ inertial time - scale , ” may be combined as follows : relative to a coordinate system in which three free particles move in straight lines and travel mutually - proportional distances , the motion of any fourth free particle will be rectilinear and uniform .
The questionable Newtonian concepts of absolute rotation and acceleration , Lange proposed , could now be replaced by the concepts of “ inertial rotation ” and “ inertial acceleration , ” i.e. rotation and acceleration relative to an inertial system and inertial time - scale .
See Figures 2 and 3 .
( a ) ( b ) Figure 2 : Neumann ’s Time - Scale By Newton ’s first law , a particle not subject to forces travels equal distances in equal times .
But which particles are free of forces ?
This might appear to be a matter of convention .
( a) Either \ ( P_1\ ) or \ ( P_2\ ) can be arbitrarily stipulated to be at the origin of a system of coordinates , and to serve as the measure of equal times
( b) But one can say of two particles with different velocities : in intervals of time in which one moves a given distance \ ( d_1\ ) , the other moves a proportional distance \ ( d_2 = kd_1 \ ) ( where k is a constant ; i.e. , \( d_1/d_2 = k\ ) ) .
Or one can compare a particle to a freely rotating planet : in intervals of time through which the planet rotates through equal angles , the particle moves equal distances .
Figure 3 : Lange ’s Definition of ‘ inertial system ’ ( 1885 ) An inertial system is a coordinate system with respect to which three free particles , projected from a single point and moving in non-coplanar directions , move in straight lines and travel mutually - proportional distances .
The law of inertia then states that relative to any inertial system , any fourth free particle will move uniformly .
At about the same time , apparently unaware of the work of Mach , Neumann , and Lange , James Thomson — older brother of William Thomson , Lord Kelvin — expressed the content of the law of inertia , and the appropriate frame of reference and time - scale ( “ dial - traveller ” ) , in a somewhat simpler manner :
For any set of bodies acted on each by any force , a REFERENCE FRAME and a REFERENCE DIAL - TRAVELLER are kinematically possible , such that relatively to them conjointly , the motion of the mass - centre of each body , undergoes change simultaneously with any infinitely short element of the dial - traveller progress , or with any element during which the force on the body does not alter in direction nor in magnitude , which change is proportional to the intensity of the force acting on that body , and to the simultaneous progress of the dial - traveller , and is made in the direction of the force .
( Thomson 1884 , p. 387 )
Thomson did not reject the term “ absolute rotation ” .
Instead , he held that it is properly defined as rotation relative to a frame that satisfies his definition of a reference frame .
A body that is rotating with respect to a reference frame ( and dial - traveller ) is rotating with respect to any other frame in uniform motion relative to the first .
The definition does not express , as Lange ’s does , the degree of arbitrariness involved in the construction of an inertial system by means of free particles .
By dispensing with the idealization of free particles , Thomson ’s definition aims to characterize an inertial frame for an actual system of interacting bodies .
However , it does not quite fulfill its aim .
Like Lange ’s definition , it leaves out a crucial condition for an inertial system as we understand it : all forces must belong to action - reaction pairs .
Otherwise we could have , as on a rotating sphere , merely apparent ( centrifugal ) forces that are , by definition , proportional to mass and acceleration , and so the rotating sphere would satisfy Thomson ’s definition .
Therefore the definition needs to be completed by the stipulation that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction .
( This completion was actually proposed by R.F. Muirhead in 1887 . )
But , so completed , Thomson ’s definition makes the essential point about the relation between Newton ’s laws of motion and the inertial frames : that the laws assert the existence of at least one inertial frame .
If one inertial frame is posited , in which accelerations properly correspond to Newtonian forces , then any other inertial frame is in uniform motion with respect to the first ; the forces , masses , and accelerations measured in one will have the same measures in any other .
Any one may be arbitrarily designated as an all - encompassing “ immobile space ” in which all others are moving uniformly .
Thus the original question , “ relative to what frame of reference do the laws of motion hold ? ” is revealed to be wrongly posed .
For the laws of motion essentially determine a class of reference frames , and ( in principle ) a procedure for constructing them .
For the same reason , a skeptical question that is still commonly asked about the laws of motion — why is it that the laws are true only relative to a certain choice of reference frame ? — is also wrongly posed .
If Newton ’s laws are true , then we can construct an inertial frame ; their truth does n’t depend on our ability to construct such a frame in advance .
Mach expressed the situation particularly clearly :
It is very much the same whether we refer the laws of motion to absolute space , or express them abstractly , without express indication of the system of reference .
The latter course is unproblematic and practical , for in treating particular cases the student of mechanics looks for a suitable system of reference .
But owing to the fact that the first way , whenever there was any actual issue at stake , was nearly always interpreted as having the same meaning as the latter , Newton ’s error was much less dangerous than it would otherwise have been .
( 1933 , p. 269 . )
Mach ’s remark roughly corresponds to Newton ’s actual procedure .
Even though , for Newton , absolute space was the implicit reference - frame for stating the laws of motion , the frame for their application was the standard one for most of the history of astronomy : the fixed stars .
This seemingly arbitrary starting - point did not undermine Newton ’s procedure as an account of the “ true motions . ”
For the framework of the fixed stars , initially taken for granted , turns out to be justified in the course of Newton ’s dynamical analysis .
If all the accelerations relative to the fixed stars can be analyzed into action - reaction pairs involving bodies within the system — leaving no “ leftover ” accelerations that need to be traced to some yet - unknown influence — then we can conclude that the stars are a suitable ( sufficiently inertial ) frame of reference after all .
Newton could appeal to a particular case to test this general point : the orbits of the outer planets were stable with respect to the fixed stars , their perihelia showing no measurable precession ( unlike the perihelion of Mercury , for a famous example ) .
Newton argued , then , that a relative space in which these apsides are stable is a sufficient approximation to a space at rest or in uniform motion ( cf. Book III , Proposition XIV , 1687 b , p. 420 ) .
Mach took particular notice of Newton ’s use of the relativity principle in determining an appropriate reference - frame :
In order to have a generally valid system of reference , Newton introduced Corollary V of the Principia .
He thought of … a coordinate system for which the law of inertia holds , fixed in space without rotation relative to the fixed stars .
He could also allow an arbitrary origin and uniform translation of this system … without losing its usefulness …
One can see that the reduction to absolute space was in no way necessary , since the reference frame is just as relatively determined as in any other case .
( 1933 , p. 227 . )
For Mach , this was an important acknowledgement of Newton ’s insight into the relativity of motion .
Starting from Corollary V , the concept of the inertial frame solved the problem of absolute rotation and acceleration , as a problem internal to the system of Newton ’s laws .
Absolute space could be dispensed with , without undermining Newton ’s dynamical distinctions among states of motion .
Of course , this point did not dismiss Mach ’s skeptical questions regarding the laws themselves .
Instead , it posed them in a more precise form :
Are Newton ’s laws truly general laws of nature , that determine a class of privileged frames ?
Or do they only describe motions relative to a particular material frame , the fixed stars ?
Empirical evidence was insufficient to decide .
Eventually Mach ’s question helped to motivate Einstein ’s search for new laws in which privileged frames would not play an essential role .
First , however , by comparing Newtonian mechanics with Maxwell ’s electrodynamics , Einstein placed the notion of inertial frame on an entirely new footing ( see below , Section 2.2 et seq . ) .
1.7 “ Quasi- inertial ” frames : Newton ’s Corollary VI
A striking aspect of Newton ’s treatment of indistinguishable frames of reference was his discovery of approximately indistinguishable frames : spaces that are accelerating , yet can be treated , for practical purposes , as if they were at rest or in uniform motion .
Newton made this notion precise in Corollary VI to the laws of motion :
If bodies are moved in any way among themselves , and are urged by equal accelerative forces along parallel lines , they will all continue to move among themselves in the same way as if they were not acted on by those forces .
( 1687 b , p. 20 . )
As Corollaries IV and V implied , for a given system of interacting bodies , their center of gravity is unmoved by the actions of the bodies among themselves , and will remain at rest or in uniform motion as long as the bodies are not disturbed by any external forces .
This , as we noted , was as close as Newton could come to the notion of an inertial frame .
Corollary VI shows that , in very special ideal circumstances — accelerative forces that act equally on all bodies within a system , and accelerate them all in parallel directions — an accelerating system of bodies will behave , internally , as if there were no external forces acting on it at all .
Yet Newton ’s discovery was not limited to the point made explicitly in Corollary VI .
Rather , it was threefold .
The second point was that there was in fact a force acting equally and in parallel lines , at least to a high approximation , on important systems of celestial bodies .
The system of Jupiter and its satellites , for example , is obviously accelerating , as its center of gravity completes an approximately elliptical orbit around the Sun bound by accelerative forces toward the Sun ’s center .
But because the accelerations of all the bodies are nearly equal and parallel , their motions among themselves are nearly the same as if no such forces acted , and the system may be treated as the sort of system described in Corollary V. Evidently the accelerations are unequal , since Jupiter and the satellites are at varying distances from the sun , and they cannot be parallel since they are all directed at the center of the sun .
But these differences of distance and direction are so small , in comparison with the distance of the entire system from the sun , that they may be neglected .
And the same applies to the centripetal acceleration of Saturn ’s system .
Newton applied this same reasoning to the entire solar system : even if the entire system were accelerating toward some unknown gravitational source , he could treat the solar system itself as if it were an isolated system .
He argued , from the analysis of accelerations within the system , that outside forces must be acting more or less equally and in parallel directions on all parts of the system .
It may be imagined that the sun and planets are impelled by some other force equally and in the direction of parallel lines ; but such a force ( by Cor. VI of the Laws of Motion ) would not change the situation of the planets among themselves , nor would produce any sensible effect ; but we are concerned with the causes of sensible effects .
Let us , therefore , neglect every such force as precarious , and of no bearing on the phenomena of the heavens … .
( 1687a , article 13 . )
Newton raised this point in order to show that the possibility of such a force acting on the whole solar system would not affect his calculations of the forces acting within the system .
In the calculation relevant to this passage , Newton was using Corollary VI to defend the inference that the force responsible for Jupiter ’s orbit is directed to the Sun rather than to the Earth : neglecting any such imaginary force , “ then all the remaining force by which …
Jupiter is urged will tend ( by prop .
3 , corol .
1 ) toward the center of the sun ” ( ibid ) .
This calculation formed an important step in the argument for a heliocentric system .
Such a use of Corollary VI parallels , therefore , his use of Corollary V ( and its earlier form , “ Law 3 ” ) to show that the “ frame of the system of the world ” could be determined without regard to the system ’s uniform motion in absolute space .
Indeed , the analogy between the two kinds of case helps to explain Newton ’s changing the relativity principle from a law to a Corollary , for this coincides historically with his first use of Corollary VI .
The two Corollaries identify two classes of frames of reference that may be treated as equivalent , because they involve , respectively , theoretically and practically indistinguishable states of motion .
The frames corresponding to Corollary VI may be called “ quasi- inertial , ” because “ approximately inertial ” might be misleading : a closed orbit around the Sun — like that of Jupiter ’s system — is not a good approximation to an inertial motion , and the system can hardly be considered isolated .
But over sufficiently limited segments of its orbit , its motion is sufficiently close to being inertial .
Moreover — and most important — the accelerative forces toward the sun are close enough to being equal and parallel that the forces acting within the system can be effectively isolated from the forces from without .
Hence , while “ quasi- inertial ” is a useful term for the reference - frame corresponding to such a group of bodies , a useful description for the group itself is George Smith ’s “ quasi- insular system ” ( Smith 2019 ) .
A system of masses bound in orbit around a larger mass is by no means isolated , yet in the right conditions it may be treated as if it were .
The modern term , “ local inertial frame , ” is not inappropriate ( cf. Schutz 1990 , p. 124 ) .
But it typically designates the local coordinate frame of a given inertial observer , rather than the sort of “ whole space ” that Newton had in mind , as encompassing a celestial system as large as that of Jupiter , or the solar system as a whole .
Moreover , it is typically used in a context in which a global inertial frame , with respect to which any such Newtonian system has a definite acceleration , would not be assumed to exist .
This last point leads to the third point of Newton ’s discovery : that the “ quasi- inertial ” system is part of a mathematical framework for approximative reasoning , to determine the precise degree of isolation that a group of interacting bodies may be said to possess .
Proposition III of the Principia established Newton ’s method for treating a body orbiting a second body which is , itself , subject to a centripetal force :
Proposition III , Theorem III : Every body , that , by a radius drawn to the centre of another body , in any way moved , describes areas about that centre proportional to the times , is urged by a force compounded out of the centripetal force tending to that other body , and of all the accelerative force by which that other body is impelled .
( 1687 b , p. 39 ) .
In other words , if an orbiting body obeys Kepler ’s area law , then any accelerative force acting on the central body is simply added to the centripetal force that maintains the orbiting body in its orbit .
This principle of composition formed the mathematical basis for Newton ’s treatment of quasi-inertial frames .
When a system of lesser bodies is , as a whole , revolving around a greater body , we have a geometrical framework to describe how closely the motions of the lesser system approximate the conditions of Corollary VI :
Book I , Proposition LXV , Case 2 : Suppose that the accelerative attractions towards the greater body to be among themselves reciprocally as the squares of the distances ; and then , by increasing the distance of the great body till the differences of the straight lines drawn from that to the others in respect of their length , and the inclinations of those lines to each other , are less than any given , then the motions of the parts of the system , will continue with no errors except such as are less than any given .
And because , by the small distance of those parts from each other , the whole system is attracted as if it were only one body , it will therefore be moved by this attraction as if it were one body ….( 1687 b , p. 172 . )
Thus the situation described by Corollary VI , in Newton ’s analysis , emerges as a limiting case of an orbiting system under an inverse - square force .
As the size of the orbit is arbitrarily increased , the accelerations toward the center become indistinguishable from equal and parallel accelerations .
Evidently , Newton ’s proposition provides , characteristically , a general method for treating a variety of possible configurations .
But it enabled Newton to address the specific physical fact of the variation in the Sun ’s gravity , and its consequences for the superposition upon it of lesser gravitating systems .
At the distance of Jupiter or Saturn , a revolving system can be a very nearly regular Keplerian system .
As the distance to the Sun decreases , however , differences in magnitude and direction of the accelerations become significant , and at the distance of the Earth - Moon system the motions become nearly intractable .
The decisive factor is the proportion between the size of the orbiting system and its distance from the center of attraction .
The actual existence of quasi-inertial frames , corresponding to the abstract cases of Proposition LXV , was a crucial part of Newton ’s argument for universal gravitation — more precisely , that the force holding the planets and their satellites in their respective orbits is , in fact , the same force as gravity .
One crucial ground for the identification was the fact that the interplanetary force shares the most striking feature of terrestrial gravity , namely , that it imparts the same acceleration to all terrestrial bodies .
This principle was discovered by Galileo , of course , but Newton tested it more severely , and with a greater variety of test bodies .
He constructed pendulums of identical wooden boxes suspended from strings of equal length , which he filled with different materials ; he found that these differences made no difference to the speed of falling over many oscillations of the pendulums .
By this means he showed that Galileo ’s principle holds to a much higher degree of accuracy than Galileo was able to show , and inferred that a body ’s weight toward the earth is generally proportional to its mass .
( 1687 b , Book III , Proposition VI ) .
But Newton extended this principle beyond terrestrial gravity , to the accelerative forces acting on the planets and their satellites .
Proposition IV , Corollary VI , from Book I , showed that an orbiting body that obeys Kepler ’s third law is urged toward the center by an inverse - square force .
Newton could then show that the centripetal forces acting on Jupiter ’s moons depend only on the inverse - square of the distance towards Jupiter ’s center :
since the satellites of Jupiter perform their revolutions in times that observe the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances from Jupiter ’s center , their accelerative gravities towards Jupiter will be inversely as the squares of their distances from Jupiter ’s centre ; that is , equal , at equal distances … .
And by the same argument , if the circumsolar planets were let fall at equal distances from the Sun , they would , in their descent towards the Sun , describe equal spaces in equal times .
But forces that equally accelerate unequal bodies must be as those bodies ; that is to say , the weights of the planets towards the Sun must be as their quantities of matter .
( Ibid . )
In each of these cases , that is , Newton found that the centripetal acceleration behaves like gravitational acceleration , and so the bodies ’ forces toward their respective centers are , essentially , their weights toward those centers .
Moreover , the orbits of Jupiter ’s moons provided a completely novel test of Galileo ’s principle , on an extremely large scales of mass and distance .
For he showed that Jupiter and its moons — within the limits of observational accuracy — undergo the same accelerations toward the sun ( cf. 1687 b , Book I , Proposition 65 ; Book III , Proposition VI ) .
Any non-negligible difference in these accelerations would produce corresponding irregularities in the satellites ’ orbits .
The proportionality of weight to mass was understood in its broader foundational significance , as the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass , through Einstein ’s “ principle of equivalence ” ( cf. Einstein 1916 ; see also Norton 1985 ) .
In Einstein ’s reasoning , the identity of inertia and gravitation helped to undermine the special status of inertial motion , and suggested the extension of the relativity principle from inertial frames to frames in any state of motion whatever .
If an inertial frame , K , cannot be distinguished from another frame K′ that is uniformly accelerated with respect to K , then K′ may equally be treated as a “ privileged ” or “ stationary ” frame : “ they have equal title as systems of reference for the description of physical phenomena ” ( Einstein 1916 , p. 114 ) .
This circumstance undermines a defining characteristic of inertial frames : that with respect to a given inertial frame , every other inertial frame is in uniform rectilinear motion .
Corollary VI points the way , after all , toward an extended relativity principle .
The assumption of the complete physical equivalence of the systems of co-ordinates , K and K′ , we call the “ principle of equivalence ; ” this principle is evidently intimately connected with the theorem of the equality between the inert and the gravitational mass , and signifies an extension of the principle of relativity to co-ordinate systems which are in non-uniform motion relatively to each other .
In fact , through this conception we arrive at the unity of the nature of inertia and gravitation .
( Einstein 1922 ) .
This reasoning , in turn , suggested the connection between the gravitational field and the curvature of space - time .
( See Einstein 1916 ; see also Related Entries : Einstein , Albert : philosophy of science | general relativity : early philosophical interpretations of ) .
Even independently of Einstein ’s theory , however , one might see in hindsight that Newton ’s application of Corollary VI , and his identification of what we ’ve been calling quasi-inertial frames , already undermined the idea of an inertial frame .
As we saw , Newton could treat a quasi-inertial system like that of Jupiter and its moons , not as essentially different from the system of the Earth and the Moon , but as a limiting case of such a system : as the whole system becomes sufficiently far from the central body , the differences among the accelerations of its parts toward their common center become negligibly small .
In other words , Newton could treat such systems , and the mathematical description of the differences among them , as revealing the structure and workings of the sun ’s gravity , rather than as questioning the fundamental distinction between uniform and accelerated motion .
In that sense , he was not proposing the “ complete physical equivalence ” of uniformly accelerating systems with uniformly moving systems ( inertial frames ) .
But even Newton recognized , as we also saw , that the solar system as a whole might have an unknown and practically unknowable acceleration .
In effect , he explained why his analysis of accelerations of the bodies in the system , among themselves , required no knowledge of any absolute accelerations .
In the 19th century , Maxwell , without questioning the underlying framework of absolute space and time , pointed out that Corollary VI implied a kind of relativity of acceleration ( 1878 , pp. 51 –52 ) .
Viewing the foregoing in hindsight , more recent literature has suggested that the physics of the Principia did not really require the notion of inertial frame at all , and therefore that a weaker geometry than Newtonian spacetime would be a sufficient background structure for Newton ’s dynamical reasoning ( cf. Saunders , 2013 ) .
It is further suggested , following Cartan ( 1923 , 1924 ) , that the space - time structure and the gravitational field be unified in a curved space - time ( cf. section 9 , below ) , as a Newtonian version of general relativity ( cf.

The relevant conceptual resources and mathematical techniques for such approaches , evidently , developed only in the aftermath of general relativity .
We return to this theme in 2.5 .
2. Inertial frames in the 20th century : special and general relativity
2.1 Inertial frames in Newtonian spacetime
By the early years of the 20th century , the notion of inertial system seems to have been widely accepted as the basis for Newtonian mechanics , even if the specific works of Lange and Thomson were little noticed .
In writing “ On the electrodynamics of moving bodies ” in 1905 , Einstein took it to be obvious to his readers that classical mechanics does not require a single privileged frame of reference , but an equivalence - class of frames , all in uniform motion relative to each other , and in any of which “ the equations of mechanics hold good . ”
Two inertial frames with coordinates \((x , y , z , t ) \ ) and \(( x ' , y ' , z ' , t' ) \ ) are related by the Galilean transformations ,
\ [ \begin{align*} x ' &= x - vt \\ y' &= y \\ z ' &= z \\ t' &= t \end{align *}\ ]
( assuming that the x - axis is defined to be the direction of their relative motion ) .
These transformations clearly preserve the invariant quantities of Newtonian mechanics , i.e. acceleration , force , and mass ( and therefore time , length , and simultaneity ) .
As far as Newtonian mechanics was concerned , then , the problem of absolute motion was completely solved ; all that remained was to express the equivalence of inertial frames in a simpler geometrical structure .
The lack of a privileged spatial frame , combined with the obvious existence of privileged states of motion — paths defined as rectilinear in space and uniform with respect to time — suggests that the geometrical situation ought to be regarded from a four - dimensional spatio - temporal point of view .
The structure defined by the class of inertial frames can be captured in the statement that space - time is a four - dimensional affine space , whose straight lines ( geodesics ) are the trajectories of particles in uniform rectilinear motion .
See Figure 4 .
Figure 4 : Inertial Trajectories as Straight Lines of Space - time
That is , space - time is a structure whose automorphisms — the Galilean transformations that relate one inertial frame to another — are affine transformations : they take straight lines into straight lines , and parallel lines into parallel lines .
The former condition implies that an inertial motion in one frame will be an inertial motion in any other frame , and likewise for an accelerating or rotational motion .
The latter implies that uniformly - moving particles or observers who are relatively at rest in one frame will also be relatively at rest in another .
An inertial frame can be characterized as a family of parallel straight lines “ filling ” space - time , representing the possible trajectories of a family of free particles that are relatively at rest .
See Figure 5 .
Therefore , to assert that an inertial frame exists is to impose a global structure on space - time ; it is equivalent to the assertion that space - time is an affine space that is flat .
Figure 5 : Each of these families of straight lines , \ ( F_1 \ ) and \ ( F_2\ ) , represents the trajectories of a family of free particles that are relatively at rest , and therefore each defines an inertial frame .
Relative to each other , the frames defined by \ ( F_1\ ) and \ ( F_2\ ) are in uniform motion .
Each of the surfaces S is a “ hypersurface of absolute simultaneity ” representing all of space at a given moment ; evidently ( given the Galilean transformations ) two inertial frames will agree on which events in space - time are simultaneous .
The form of the Galilean transformations shows that , in addition to being affine transformations , they also preserve metrical relations on time and space .
Distinct inertial frames will agree on simultaneity , and on ( ratios of ) time - intervals ; they will also agree on the spatial distance between points at a given moment of time .
Therefore , in the four - dimensional picture , the decomposition of space - time into hypersurfaces of absolute simultaneity is independent of the choice of inertial frame .
Another way of putting this is that Newtonian space - time is endowed with a projection of space onto time , i.e. a function that identifies space - time points that have the same time - coordinate .
Similarly , absolute space arises from a projection of space - time onto space , i.e. a function that identifies space - time points that have the same spatial coordinates .
See Figure 6 .
Figure 6
But Galilean relativity implies that this latter projection is arbitrary .
While it assumes that we can identify the same time at different spatial locations , Newtonian mechanics provides no physical way of identifying the same spatial point at different times .
Thus the equivalence of inertial frames can be thought of as the arbitrariness of the projection of space - time onto space .
Any such projection is , essentially , the arbitrary choice of some particular inertial frame as a rest - frame .
In the relativized version of Newton ’s theory , then , the class of inertial frames replaces absolute space , while absolute time remains .
The structure of Newtonian space - time ( also known as Galilean space - time , or neo- Newtonian space - time ) expresses this fact in a direct and obvious way .
( See Stein 1967 and Ehlers 1973 for further explanation . )
( a ) ( b ) Figure 7 : ( a ) Here is a space - time diagram of motions relative to the inertial frame in which \ ( O_1\ ) , \ ( O_2\ ) , and \ ( P_1\ ) are at rest .
This can be seen as arising from the projection of each of their inertial trajectories onto a single point of space .
\ ( O_3\ ) is in uniform motion .
\ ( O_4\ ) is accelerating any old way .
\ ( O_5 \ ) and \ ( O_6\ ) are revolving around their common center of gravity \ ( P_1\ ) , which ( as noted above ) is at rest .
\ ( O_7 \ ) and \ ( O_8\ ) are revolving around their center of gravity \ ( P_2\ ) , which is in uniform motion .
( b) Here is the same situation viewed from an inertial frame in which \ ( O_3 \ ) and \ ( P_2\ ) are at rest .
Now \ ( O_1 , \ ) \ ( O_2 , \ ) and \ ( P_1\ ) are in uniform motion .
\ ( O_4\ ) is accelerating any old way .
\ ( O_5 \ ) and \ ( O_6\ ) are revolving around their common center of gravity \ ( P_1\ ) , which is in uniform motion .
\ ( O_7 \ ) and \ ( O_8\ ) are revolving around their center of gravity \ ( P_2\ ) , which ( as noted above ) is at rest .
2.2
The conflict between Galilean relativity and modern electrodynamics
By the time that this representation of the Newtonian space - time structure was developed , however , the Newtonian conception of inertial frame had been essentially overthrown .
First , 19th - century electrodynamics raised again the question of a privileged frame of reference : the conception of light as an electromagnetic wave in the ether implied that the rest - frame of the ether itself should play a distinguished role in electrodynamical phenomena .
On the one hand , physicists such as Maxwell and Lorentz were careful to point out that velocity relative to the ether was not equivalent to absolute velocity , because the state of motion of the ether itself was necessarily unknown .
In other words , this conception of light did not necessarily violate the classical principle of relativity .
On the other hand , the existence of such a preferred frame made the equivalence of inertial frames correspondingly less interesting , even if it was true in principle .
This is why the appearance of the idea of inertial frame in the 1880s , as suggested earlier , was not of pressing physical interest to the majority of physicists , and seemed to be a mere philosophical sidelight .
The attempts to measure the effects of motion relative to the ether commanded considerably more attention .
Second , the abandonment of the ether — following the failure of attempts to measure velocity relative to the ether and , more generally , the apparent independence of all electrodynamical phenomena of motion relative to the ether — did not vindicate the Newtonian inertial frame .
Rather , it required a dramatically revised conception .
Special relativity might be said to have applied the relativity principle of Newtonian mechanics to Maxwell ’s electrodynamics , by eliminating the privileged status of the rest - frame of the ether and admitting that the velocity of light is independent of the motion of the source .
As Einstein expressed it , “ the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good . ” ( 1905 , p. 38 . )
But as Einstein also pointed out , the invariance of the velocity of light and the principle of relativity , at least in its Galilean form , are incompatible .
It simply makes no sense , according to Galilean relativity , that any velocity should appear to be the same in inertial frames that are in relative motion .
2.3 Special relativity and Lorentz invariance
Einstein solved this difficulty through his analysis of simultaneity : frames in relative motion can agree on the velocity of light only if they disagree on simultaneity .
Only the relativity of simultaneity makes possible the invariance of the velocity of light .
This means that the transformations between inertial frames that preserve the velocity of light will not preserve simultaneity .
These are the Lorentz transformations :
\[ x ' = \ frac{x - vt}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} \quad y'=y \quad z'=z \quad t'= \frac{t-vx/c^2}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} \]
Evidently these transformations preserve the velocity of light , but they do not preserve length and time .
So the invariant quantities of Newtonian mechanics , which presuppose invariant measures of length and time , must now depend on the choice of inertial frame .
In other words , acceleration is an invariant quantity only when it is zero , for the magnitude of a non-zero acceleration will differ for observers in relative motion .
Therefore the notions of force , mass , and acceleration no longer provides an appropriate definition of an inertial frame , except in the ideal case of a frame in which no forces are acting .
Einstein ’s definition instead appeals to the invariant quantities of electrodynamics : an inertial frame is one in which light travels equal distances in equal times in arbitrary directions .
What seems impossible , from the point of view of Galilean relativity , is that a frame that moves uniformly relative to one frame that satisfies Einstein ’s definition should also satisfy the definition .
But that seeming impossibility rests , again , on the assumption that two inertial frames will have a common measure of simultaneity .
Einstein showed that light - signals provide an empirically and theoretically reasonable definition of simultaneity , in light of the empirical soundness of Maxwell ’s equations and the apparent invariance of the velocity of light .
In the absence of an empirically reasonable alternative compatible with Galilean invariance , there is no sound criterion of simultaneity that will give the same results in different inertial frames .
Of course , it would remain true that in a given inertial frame , the motions of free particles would satisfy the requirements of Lange ’s definition , and particles that move uniformly in one such frame would also move uniformly in any other .
But such a definition is not a substitute for Einstein ’s definition , since it must itself presuppose a definition of simultaneity .
Otherwise , its appeal to the measurement and comparison of times and distances is without a sound empirical basis .
Einstein ’s definition places such measurements on an empirical basis .
Their results , however , will depend on the choice of an inertial frame , and will vary systematically according to the relative velocities of different inertial frames .
The space - time structure of special relativity thus differs essentially from Newtonian space - time , and is called “ Minkowski space - time ” since Minkowski ( 1908 ) first formulated Einstein ’s theory in its four - dimensional form .
It is an affine space , like Newtonian space - time .
In both cases , the trajectories of free particles are straight lines of the affine structure , and a set of parallel inertial trajectories ( geodesics ) corresponds to an inertial frame .
As we just saw , however , Newtonian space - time presupposes the invariant division of space - time into three - dimensional hypersurfaces of absolute simultaneity , and an objective measure of distance between points at a given moment of absolute time .
Minkowski space - time is a four - dimensional vector space with an invariant four - dimensional metrical structure , imposed by the invariance of the speed of light .
Instead of an invariant spatial interval between simultaneous events , there is an invariant spatio - temporal interval between any two points in space - time .
Since there is no invariant relation of simultaneity , the sets of simultaneous events for any inertial frame are the hyperplanes orthogonal to the trajectories that determine that frame .
In other words , the choice between two inertial frames determines a choice between two distinct divisions of space - time into space and time .
See Figure 8 :
Figure 8 : The inertial frames \ ( F\ ) and \ ( F'\ ) are in relative motion , and therefore , as the Lorentz transformations indicate , they disagree on simultaneity .
\ ( F\ ) and \ ( F'\ ) thus determine distinct decompositions of space - time into instantaneous spaces , \ ( S\ ) and \ ( S'\ ) , respectively
2.4 Simultaneity and reference - frames
The details of Einstein ’s argument and the structure of Minkowski space - time can be found elsewhere ( see , e.g. , Einstein 1951 and Geroch 1978 ) .
Here only one more point is worth making .
It could be argued that Einstein ’s and Lorentz ’s view are completely equivalent .
That is , we could assume that there is indeed a privileged frame of reference , and that the apparent invariance of the velocity of light is explained by the effects on bodies of their motion through the ether ( the Lorentz contraction and time dilation ) .
This purported distinction between empirically indistinguishable frames has often been criticized on straightforward methodological grounds , but it could be ( and surely has been ) argued that it is more intuitively plausible than the relativity of simultaneity .
After all , knowing that ( as Einstein showed ) the Lorentz contraction can be derived from the invariance of the velocity of light does not , by itself , entitle us to say which of the two is the more convincing starting - point .
This is why it is so important that Einstein ’s 1905 paper begins with a critical analysis of the entire notion of a frame of reference .
It is tacitly assumed by Lorentz ’s theory , and classical electrodynamics generally , that we have a reference - frame in which we can measure the velocity of light , and that there is a distinguished frame — at rest with respect to the ether — in which its true velocity would be measured .
But how is such a reference - frame determined ?
The distances between points in space can only be determined if it is possible to determine which events are simultaneous .
In practice this is always done by light - signalling , if only in the informal sense that we identify simultaneous events when we see them at the same time .
But if the spatial frame of reference is determined by light - signals , and is then to be used to measure the speed of light , we would appear to be going in a circle .
For this reason , Poincaré concluded that determining the speed of light is partly a matter of convention ( 1898 ) .
Before Einstein , however , it was tacitly assumed that , while light - signalling is useful and practical , it is not essential to the definition of simultaneity .
There would be , therefore , a fact of the matter about which events are simultaneous that is independent of this method of signalling .
This assumption was actually made explicit by James Thomson .
He recognized — as few did before Poincaré and Einstein — that the measurement of distance involves
the difficulty as to imperfection of our means of ascertaining or specifying , or clearly idealizing , simultaneity at distant places .
For this we do commonly use signals by sound , by light , by electricity , by connecting wires or bars , and by various other means .
The time required in the transmission of the signal involves an imperfection in human powers of ascertaining simultaneity of occurrences at distant places .
It seems , however , probably not to involve any difficulty of idealizing or imagining the existence of simultaneity .
Probably it may not be felt to involve any difficulty comparable to that of attempting to form a distinct notion of identity of place at successive times in unmarked space .
( 1884 , p. 380 ) .
In other words , Thomson assumed that it was not a difficulty in principle , like the difficulty of determining rest in absolute space .
But Einstein showed that it was precisely the same kind of difficulty : determinations of simultaneity involve reference to an arbitrary choice of reference - frame , just as much as determinations of velocity .
Einstein ’s conclusion is , of course , entirely contingent on the empirical facts of electrodynamics .
It could have been avoided if there were in nature a useful signal of some kind whose transmission would provide a criterion of absolute simultaneity , so that the same events would be determined to be simultaneous in all inertial frames .
Or , experiments such as those of Michelson and Morley might have succeeded in exhibiting the dependence of the velocity of light on the state of motion of the source .
Then synchronization by light - signals could still have been regarded as a mere practical substitute for a notion of absolute simultaneity that stood on independent grounds , empirically as well as conceptually .
But as Einstein saw , because of the apparent independence of the velocity of light of the motion of the source , even “ idealizing or imagining the existence of simultaneity ” involves light - signalling more essentially than anyone could have realized .
Unless some other criterion of simultaneity is provided , therefore , the establishment of a spatial frame of reference involves light - signalling in an essential way .
In the absence of such a criterion the speed of light cannot be , as Lorentz supposed , empirically measured against the background of an inertial frame .
By appealing to the speed of light in defining simultaneity , Einstein gave an empirically sound construction both for spatio- temporal measurement and for a dynamically distinct class of reference - frames .
( Cf. DiSalle 2006 , ch. 4 . )
2.5 From special relativity and Lorentz invariance to general relativity and general covariance
It may seem surprising that , after this insightful analysis of the concept of inertial frame and its role in electrodynamics , Einstein should have turned almost immediately to call that concept into question .
But he became convinced , largely by his reading of Mach , that the central role of inertial frames was an “ epistemological defect ” that special relativity shared with Newtonian mechanics .
Only relative motions are observable , yet both of these theories purport to identify a privileged state of motion and use it to explain observable effects ( such as centrifugal forces ) .
Coordinate systems are not observable , yet both of these theories assign a fundamental physical role to certain kinds of coordinate system , namely , the inertial systems .
In either theory , inertial coordinates are distinguished from all others , and the laws of physics are said to hold only relative to inertial coordinate systems .
In an epistemologically sophisticated theory , both of these problems would be solved at once : the new theory would only refer to what is observable , which is relative motion ; it would admit arbitrary coordinate systems , instead of confining itself to a special class of system .
Why , after all , should any genuine physical phenomenon depend on the choice of coordinate system ?
Another way of expressing Einstein ’s view is to say that , in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity , rotation is “ absolute ” because the transformations between inertial frames ( Galilean or Lorentzian ) preserve rotational states .
Thus the “ absoluteness ” of rotation arises precisely from singling out one type of frame , by one type of transformation , instead of allowing arbitrary transformations and arbitrary frames .
Einstein held that this epistemological insight had a natural mathematical representation in the principle of general covariance , or the principle that the laws of nature are to be invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations .
More precisely , what this means is that coordinate transformations are no longer required ( as in the affine spaces of Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ) to take straight lines to straight lines , and to preserve further metrical structures appropriate to each theory , but only to preserve the smoothness of curves ( i.e. their differentiability ) .
The general theory of relativity was intended to be a generally covariant theory of space - time , and its general covariance was intended to express the general relativity of motion ( Cf. Einstein 1916 , section 3 ) .
The extent to which the theory realized Einstein ’s original aims remains a topic of philosophical debate .
( Cf. Related Entries : “ space and time : the hole argument , ” “ Einstein ’s philosophy of science ” . )
The central role of inertial frames in Newtonian and Minkowski space - time theories , in sum , rested on their shared assumption of the uniformity of space - time .
In Newtonian mechanics and special relativity , the formal relations between inertial coordinate systems — the Galilean and Lorentz transformations , respectively — correspond to symmetry transformations of uniform space - time , that is , a space - time with non-trivial global symmetries .
In Einstein ’s context , a coordinate transformation from the coordinates of one “ stationary system ” to those of another would generally not reflect a global symmetry of space - time , just to the extent that the two were relatively accelerating .
At the same time , we can say that the concept of inertial frame retains at least one aspect of the relevance that it had for Newton .
As we saw , Newton was aware that he could not determine ( to put it in our language ) an actual inertial frame from his analysis of the solar system ; Corollary VI implied that all local phenomena were compatible with an acceleration of the entire system , by nearly equal and nearly parallel accelerative forces acting on the sun , the planets , and their satellites .
By the very same reasoning , however , he established that such a uniformly accelerating frame was sufficient for a successful analysis of the relevant causes acting within the system — those causes that determine the system ’s configuration .
From this analysis he could determine the configuration of the system , that is , determine that our system is approximately Keplerian , with small deviations from Keplerian motion accounted for by perturbative actions of the members of the system on each other .
In other words , though a true inertial frame cannot be determined , a sufficient approximation to an inertial frame provides a sufficient basis for this causal account .
In empirical testing and measurement in general relativity , the treatment of individual gravitating systems follows an analogous pattern .
For the analysis of interactions within a local system , an asymptotically flat solution to Einstein ’s equation plays a role analogous to the Newtonian system that approximates the conditions of Corollary VI .
In general relativity , there can be non-negligible post - Newtonian effects , such as spatial curvature , and the non-linear superposition of gravitational fields .
When they appear , empirical consequences such as anomalous precessions and light - bending provide tests of general relativity and other relativistic gravitation theories .
( See Will 2018 , ch. 4 , especially 4.1–4.3 ) .
Abstractly , we might wish to treat such a system as isolated within a region of space - time that “ flattens out ” at infinity .
Practically , it suffices to consider a region in which , at a sufficient remove from a system of mutually gravitating masses , curvature becomes negligible in comparison with the curvature induced by those masses locally .
In other words , analogously to the Newtonian case , it is not necessary that such a system be isolated from external influences .
It suffices that external influences make a negligible difference to the actions of the masses among themselves , and to the resulting configuration of the system .
In short , instead of providing an exact account of the global symmetries of space - time , the idea of an inertial frame still provides a crucial practical tool for the empirical study of actual physical interactions .

Friday 's raids saw armed police surround flats at Peabody Buildings , in Dalgarno Gardens , north Kensington .
Bare - chested
One of those arrested there identified himself as Ibrahim Muktar Said , 27 , wanted for the attempt to bomb a number 26 bus in Shoreditch , east London , eight days ago .
A second man said his name was Ramzi Mohamed , suspected of the attempted Oval Tube bombing , police said .
Osman Hussain had been staying with his brother
Footage taken by a resident showed the suspects standing bare - chested on a balcony outside a flat .
They had been asked to surrender to police , but failed to do so , Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke , of the Metropolitan Police , said .
" Specialist tactics " were then used , he said .
Eyewitnesses had earlier talked of seeing officers wearing gas masks .
The suspect arrested in Rome , who was named as Somali - born UK citizen Hussain Osman , 27 , will be questioned over the bomb attempt at Shepherd 's Bush station .
He had been staying with his brother , who was also taken into custody , Italian officials said .
Also on Friday , UK police arrested a third man in Notting Hill , west London , and two women at the city 's Liverpool Street station .
The as yet unnamed man , arrested in Tavistock Crescent , is said by police to be of significant interest in relation to the events of 21 July .
The suspect detained last Wednesday in Birmingham was Yassin Hassan Omar , 24 , who is being questioned over a bomb attempt on the Tube near Warren Street .
' I 'm scared '
One man was arrested following the Notting Hill raid
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said police may have been able to make their arrests following tip - offs from the public or informants ; electronic interception ; or the questioning of people who were already in custody .
" I understand that the questioning of those people they have in custody was very productive , " he said .
Our correspondent added that following Friday 's arrests , the immediate priority for police was to establish if there were any further bomb plots .
Also , officers would want to know if there were any explosives lying around in warehouses and who these detainees knew .
Mr Clarke later confirmed to reporters that the Met would be seeking the return to Britain from Italy of Mr Osman .
However , it is not yet clear if he will face any charges in Italy .
Mr Clarke added that the public " must not be complacent " that the threat of attacks had disappeared in the wake of the arrests .
" The threat remains and is very real , " he said .
Detectives believe there may also have been a fifth would - be bomber on 21 July , after a device was found on Saturday in a rucksack at Little Wormwood Scrubs , near Friday 's operation .
Scotland Yard described Friday as their " best day yet " since 21 July .
Eyewitnesses to the raids in north Kensington say they heard three sounds like shots and a large explosion as officers wearing gas masks entered one of the properties .

A police source later said no shots had been fired and that explosions reported by witnesses were the sounds of officers blowing off the door to a flat on the Peabody Buildings estate .
In Dalgarno Gardens , officers were continually shouting at someone in a flat to come out .
They were addressing him as " Muhammad " , eyewitnesses said .
The police asked him : " What is the problem ?
Why can't you come out ?
" Take your clothes off .
Exit the building .
Do you understand ? "
One resident told BBC News 24 she was inside a block of flats on the estate at the time .
" They were shouting to him that he needed to come out with his arms up , in just his underwear .
' Almighty bang '
" He was saying to them : ' How do I know when I come out , that you 're not going to shoot me ?
I 'm scared ' . "
Police assured him he would not get shot as long as he followed instructions , she said , and that they knew he was not a risk to the officers or the public .
Officers told other residents on the 350 - property estate to " get inside now " .
Chris Stokes told BBC
News : " We got told to move out of the way by armed police and within about five minutes we heard three gunshots go off behind the block of flats at Tavistock Crescent . "
Allan Sneddon , who lives nearby , told BBC News : " There was this almighty bang ... big enough to shake the ground . "
