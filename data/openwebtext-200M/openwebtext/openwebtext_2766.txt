Atheist Arrogance ?
In our galaxy alone there are over a hundred - billion stars .
There are over a hundred - billion galaxies in the known universe .
In comparison to the grand scheme of things , I ca n’t even begin to comprehend exactly how small I am .
Anytime I think about these things , I am put into a state of awe .
I am impassioned by the majesty of the natural world .
The Earth itself is so diverse and amazing that it can keep me up at night thinking about how ecosystems and genetic diversity play out and have played out for the last three or four billion years .
Our universe is 13.7 billion years old , which is another number so large the human mind ca n’t comprehend it .
What ’s more interesting to me is that Sol , our local star , is only 4.57 billion years old .
It ’s a third generation star , which means that it and the rest of our solar system is made up of material from a star that sat in this same spot and then died , twice .
I often wonder if life had managed to evolve on a planet rotating around the first or second generation Sol .
Maybe that life had reached the stars and colonized this whole galaxy , only to eventually die out in the billions of years that have passed since their first sentient thought .
This seems like a lot of rambling but my point is this : the universe is exorbitantly large and remarkably old .
Our entire civilization , whether we leave Earth or not , will be more than lucky to even last a blinks worth of time to this universe .
I think that one of the most repugnant things about most organized religion is the kind of self centered id they have about our place in this world .
The whole universe was created so that our puny planet could come forth nine billion years later , and we puny humans could come about in another four billion years after that ?
That is a kind of egocentrism and arrogance that even an atheist could never have .
I find all of that incredibly unlikely .
However , I do feel fortunate to have been able to witness as much as I have so far , and I can only hope to see more of the wonders the natural world has to offer .
• Women arrested for challenging officer with no badge number •
Footage shows arresting officers binding Fit Watch pair 's feet • IPCC to receive video as concerns grow over police tactics

Two female protesters who challenged police officers for not displaying their badge numbers were bundled to the ground , arrested and held in prison for four days , according to an official complaint lodged today .
The incident was caught on camera , and footage shows officers standing on the women 's feet and applying pressure to their necks immediately after the women attempted to photograph a fellow officer who had refused to give his badge number .
The images are likely to fuel concern over the policing of protests , which is already subject to a review by the national police inspectorate and two parliamentary inquiries after the G20 demonstrations and the death of Ian Tomlinson .
Val Swain , 43 , and Emily Apple , 33 , both mothers with young children , believe they were deliberately targeted for arrest at last year 's climate camp demonstration in Kent because they campaign for Fit Watch , a protest group that opposes police surveillance at demonstrations .
The pair were remanded to a women 's prison for four days and released only after the demonstration against the Kingsnorth power station had finished .
They believe their treatment is symptomatic of the increasingly aggressive approach taken by police at political demonstrations .
Their arrests were captured on police surveillance footage obtained by the Guardian and submitted today to the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
Fit Watch activists are opposed to police forward intelligence teams ( Fits ) , the mobile surveillance units that monitor campaigners at demonstrations and meetings .
Campaigners affiliated to the group film surveillance officers in action and upload their details to a website .
They also use banners and placards to block the view of police surveillance cameras , which they claim are used to harass and intimidate protesters and gather information for police databases .
The women were quickly identified as members of the group when they appeared at the camp on 8 August last year .
The footage shows them standing near officers from West Yorkshire police , at least four of whom were not showing their badge numbers .
A police surveillance unit began filming their interactions with the officers and captured the moment that Apple engaged an officer who was refusing to divulge his badge number .
After the officer 's repeated refusals , Apple asked Swain to photograph him .
" I 'd like a picture of this officer so I can make a complaint , " she said .
" It 's West Yorkshire police – no number . "
Moments later , Swain and Apple were wrestled to the ground and placed in stress positions .
They were told had been arrested on assault and obstruction charges .
During her arrest , Swain was wrapped with restraint belts before being carried into a police van .
An officer placed his hand around Apple 's neck , apparently lifting her head for the police surveillance cameras .
A third Fit Watch campaigner , Geoff Cornock , 52 , was also arrested and bailed the following day .
Charges were later dropped against all three , whose joint complaint to the IPCC alleges that they were unlawfully arrested and detained .
In a statement , Kent police said it recognised people had made complaints but could not comment on individual cases as there was a judicial review under way .
This bill will help rein in the runaway health care costs that are bankrupting families and businesses .
It will give Americans the peace of mind of knowing that they are no longer one pink slip away from losing coverage .
It will make it illegal for insurance companies to charge people more or turn them away just because they ’re sick or older .
Combined with the work that is being done by the Senate Finance Committee , 97 percent of Americans will have coverage .
People who like their current coverage will be able to keep it , and everyone will have more choices and access to affordable coverage , no matter their lot in life .
And importantly , it includes a robust public option .
This bill represents a once - in - a - generation opportunity to fix our broken health care system .

" We know a little bit about Lori 's record ; we know that she will be a great fit with the Blue Dogs , " said Boyd , who was in a similar group with Edwards when both served in the legislature .
" She understnds how the government economic model works . "
Edwards , who faces Doug Tudor in the Democratic primary , in a conference the endorsement will help voters unfamiliar record understand that " I am a conserv and moderate Democrat . "
Asked about President Obama health care reform proposal , Edwards indeed sounded like she 'll fit right in with the Blue Dogs , saying it should be " deficit - neutral " and focus on " small business protection . "
Ten feet from the desk , in the main hallway of Boren 's new Durant headquarters , the congressman beams from a portrait , his arm draped around President George W. Bush .
A photo with the current president is nowhere to be found .
“ Barack Obama is very unpopular , ” said Boren , who represents Oklahoma ’s 2nd Congressional District .
“ He got 34 percent of the vote statewide , and less in our district .
If he were to run for re-election today , I bet it would be even worse . ”
... “ It would be a lot nicer if we had someone who was in the middle , ” he said .
“ Bill Clinton won our district .
A lot of people do n’t remember that , but he , in 1996 , carried this district .
I think if you have someone who governs from the middle , who ’s pragmatic , who works with both parties .
President Obama talks a lot about bipartisanship .
If you look at some of the legislation , he may have one or two Republicans . ”
Centrist Democrats are threatening to oppose their party ’s healthcare legislation unless House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) accepts changes that make the bill more to their liking .
Seven Blue Dogs on the House Energy and Commerce Committee have banded together to draft amendments that they ’ll co-sponsor in the committee markup , which starts Thursday .
Rep. Mike Ross ( D - Ark. ) , the Blue Dogs ’ point man on healthcare , says if those changes are n’t accepted , they ’ll vote down the bill .
“ We cannot support the current bill , ” Ross said .
“ Last time I checked , it took seven Democrats to stop a bill in Energy and Commerce . ”
Yesterday the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee voted to approve the Health Affordable Choices Act .
Every single Democrat on the committee , even right - wing corporate shill Kay Hagan of North Carolina , voted for it and , predictably , every single Republican member voted against it -- from the drooling extremists and anti-family fanatics like Richard Burr ( R- NC ) , Johnny Isakson ( R - GA ) , Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) and Pat Roberts ( R- KS ) to more mainstream conservatives like Lisa Murkowski ( R - AK ) , Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) and John McCain ( R - AZ ) .
One of the most determined progressives on the committee , Jeff Merkley ( D - OR ) , explained the bill at Daily Kos yesterday .
The fact , though , that a reactionary like Hagan was forced to vote for it , does n't mean that there are n't plenty of Democrats making common cause with obstructionist Republicans to derail it -- or at least water it down and make it ineffective .
In the Senate corrupt reactionary Democrats on the Finance Committee like Max Baucus , Tom Carper , Kent Conrad and Blanche Lincoln are working with the Republicans to carry out the demands of their Insurance Industry paymasters to weaken the bill to the point of making it untenable .
And in the House , of course , we have the always treacherous , always disingenuous Blue Dogs , many of whom are southerners who will , by nature , oppose anything and everything that could possibly help Black families or immigrant families .
Although Blue Dogs ostensibly stand for fiscal discipline , in reality , many -- if not most -- of the Blue Dogs just use that as an excuse for their own reactionary and racist politics .
The Democrats , for example , to cross the aisle and vote with the Republicans against Hate Crimes legislation last April were a gaggle of sleazy , bigoted Blue Dogs .
Similarly , it is primarily the Blue Dogs in the House who are screaming that they will oppose any bill that includes a public option or in any way forces the Insurance Industry CEOs who shower them with so much money to compete with an alternative that is based on delivering health care instead if denying it .
These are the 51 Blue Dogs in the House .
There are n't a dozen worth a collective bucket of spit :
And speaking of this trash , it 's worth noting that the Blue Dogs are already reaching out to conservative candidates , particularly in the South , in an attempt to enhance their power within the Democratic caucus .
Although progressive Navy vet Doug Tudor astounded the political establishment last year by doing so well -- with only grassroots support -- against GOP leader Adam Putnam , the Blue Dogs are trying to maneuver the DCCC into supporting a reactionary , anti-family fake Democrat , Lori Edwards , against Tudor .
Edwards , like the worst of the Blue Dogs , opposes the public option and the Blue Dogs , with corporate shill Allen Boyd in the lead , have endorsed her has endorsed Tudor and we urge everyone who can to consider making a donation to Doug 's campaign and sending a message to the DCCC that we wantDemocrats in Congress , not Blue Dog hacks serving the interests of corporate CEOs .
One Blue Dog , Patrick Murphy ( PA ) , who has been supportive of a great deal of progressive legislation , including health care reform and , most recently , ending Do n't Ask Don't Tell , is now a chair of the DCCC ’s Red to Blue program .
Yesterday he endorsed progressive Democrat Doug Pike for the seat being vacated by conservative Republican Jim Gerlach in the suburbs south of Philly .
Although I was n't too happy to read that the DCCC seems to be involving itself in a primary again , at least it's to the detriment of Blue Dog - oriented state Senator Andy Dinniman .
It will be interesting to see if the DCCC persists in butting into local primaries this year .
We do n't even like it when they do it against a conservative like Dinniman but when they do it to support Republicans - disguised - as - Democrats like Lori Edwards , it means real trouble .
Ask almost any Democrat in the House who 's the biggest scumbag in the party caucus and Dan Boren ( Blue Dog - OK ) will usually beat out even slimy neo-Confederate shit - eaters like Jim Marshall ( Blue Dog - GA ) , Heath Shuler ( Blue Dog - NC ) and Gene Taylor ( Blue Dog - MS ) , all of whom vote with the Republicans on substantive matters at least as much as they vote with Democrats .
Yesterday , Boren became the first so - called Democrat to go on a full frontal attack against President Obama .
Next time you get solicited by the DCCC to donate please think about this brief piece in today '
sAnd remember , when you donate money to the DCCC you are contributing money to anti-family extremists , reactionaries and racists like Dan Boren , no matter what youyour money is going towards .
Money donated through Blue America goes only to progressive candidates who you pick yourself -- like Doug Tudor and Jennifer Brunner .

Book Reviews
John Lennon ’s Pact with Satan
Margaret C. Galitzin
Book review of The Lennon Prophecy by Joseph Niezgoda
IPG ( New Chapter Press ) - March 2009 , 284 pp .
A book by Joseph Niezgoda - The Lennon Prophecy , A New Examination of the Death Clues of the Beatles - makes a good case for John Lennon making a pact with Satan in exchange for fame and fortune .
The author is a first generation Beatle fan , has read every book out on the rock group , and admits conflict with his love of the music and the evil that he perceives surrounds it .
His book – a 15 - year project - was an effort , he said , to try to define or make sense of that evil .
In fact , this is the book I was always planning to write about the Beatles .
Since I threw out my Beatles albums along with the rest of my rock music many years ago , I ’ve been gathering facts about the clues and signs of a Satanic link , evidence of camaraderie with occultists and their dabbling with the occult .
Believe me , plenty exists .
There is nothing new in the facts Niezgoda presents – they were all out there .
He just brings “ the clues ” – as he calls them – together to make a convincing case of Lennon ’s pact with Satan .
I believe it ’s a valid thesis , although I would go further and say the other Beatles ’ also signed the contract .
Throughout the book , he certainly implicates the whole group as linked to the occult .
Niezgoda starts his book with the well - known remark Lennon made to his friend Tony Sheridan in the mid-1960s : “ I ’ve sold my soul to the Devil . ”
In the next chapters he goes on to show how this nobody group of British miscreants rose to fame :
It is explained by a pact John Lennon made with the Devil for fame and fortune .
The pact
When was the pact made ?
Niezgoda pinpoints the date - December 27 , 1960 , the night the Beatles played at the Town Hall Ball Room in Litherland , England .
Lennon was a 20 - year old wanna - be rock star in a mediocre band not so different from so many others at the time .
He was desperate to “ be more famous than Elvis . ”
Desperate enough to sell his soul to the Devil , Niezgoda contends .
During that performance , Niezgoda reports , “ the Beatles evoked a response noticeably different from anything in their past . ”
As they played , the crowd unexpectedly surged onto the stage and the girls started to scream .
It had never happened before , but it would always happen afterward .
It was the birth of Beatlemania .
All four have noted this night as the turning point in their careers .
Chapman : he was a tool of the Devil Even though I have no specific study on the topic to object to this date , I believe it more likely that the pact was made some days before that date .
This would give the Devil time to prepare the fans for that exaggerated reaction on December 27 .
Niezgoda also says that this gig marks the beginning of Lennon 's avowedly anti-Christian behavior .
From biographies of Lennon , he presents many profane acts Lennon carried out publicly with no apparent purpose but to blaspheme Christ .
Twenty years later on December 8 , 1980 , Mark David Chapman fired five shots from a revolver at Lennon in front of the Dakota building in New York , where Yoko and John had an apartment – on the same floor , by the way , where Rosemary ’s Baby was filmed .
Lennon died shortly afterward .
If John had entered into a 20 - year pact with the Devil for wealth and world fame , that contract ended that day with his violent death .
Mark Chapman would later claim he was instructed to kill Lennon by a voice in his head that kept insisting “ Do it , do it , do it . ”
Five years later at Attica State Prison , Chapman asked for an exorcism to be made by a priest .
He said he was delivered from five or six demons .
The clues
Much of the book is an examination of “ the clues ” left by the Beatles themselves on album covers and in the music – clues that point to ties with the occult and the theory that Lennon knew the time and place of his death .
To demonstrate his thesis , he follows a well - documented trail of sorcery , mysticism , numerology , backwards masking , and anagrams .
A chilling , demonic pose with decapitated bloody babies
He claims that clues foretelling the death of Lennon are revealed in album covers such as Rubber Soul , Yesterday and Today , A Collection of Beatles Oldies , Sgt. Pepper ’s Lonely Hearts Club Band , Yellow Submarine , Magical Mystery Tour , Abbey Road as well as Lennon solo albums Imagine and Walls and Bridges .
In my opinion , you have to stretch a bit some of these clues to arrive at his thesis .
But putting them all together , one finds the evidence compelling and even a bit frightening .
For example , the album cover of The Beatles Yesterday and Today , released in 1966 , may say nothing about Lennon ’s death , but it literally shouts that the so - called Fab Four were involved in Satanism .
Called the “ butcher cover ” , in it the Beatles pose in butcher smocks with raw meat , eyeballs and decapitated babies draped over their laps and shoulder .
This horrendous picture clearly refers to the kind of infanticide that takes place in Satanic rituals and Devil worships , Niezgoda affirms .
It is the only credible way I see to explain the message of the picture – it ’s surely not just avant - garde art .
Take a look yourself and see if you would say it ’s just merry pranksters making a joke , as some Beatles ’ fans pretend .
The author also finds many “ clues ” in lyrics that also reveal the mysterious prediction of Lennon ’s death and connections to the Devil .
It ’s not so ludicrous as you might think .
Songs often came to Lennon in dreams – and usually became major hits .
It ’s why he always kept a pad of paper and pencil nearby .
In one of Lennon ’s last songs , Help me to help myself , he could well have been revealing he realized that his time was running out .
The song begin : “ Well , I tried so hard to stay alive , But the angel of destruction keeps on hounding me all around .
But I know in my heart that we never really parted , oh no . ”
In the final moments of the song , Lennon can be heard talking in a faint voice saying , “ I see .
I see .
That ’s how you ’re going to do it .
Hun , OK . ”
As Niezgoda insists , there is nothing in this book that is not already in the public domain .
All he did was connect the dots , and the resulting picture reveals occult links and the strong possibility that the Beatles had preternatural help in their rise to fame .
Would I suggest reading the book ?
No , for Catholics who already realize rock music is bad .
It is n’t worth the time .
But yes , for Catholics who still listen to and love their Beatles ’ music .
If they can become convinced of the source of the group ’s fame , they may finally become frightened enough to throw away their Beatles ’ music .

Throughout my research , I 'm always surprised when I stumble onto websites that are professionally designed and seem to offer great products and services , but lack or fail in certain important elements .
Elements that , with just a few short changes , can help multiply the results almost instantaneously .
Generally , I have found that there are seven common mistakes .
I call them the “ Seven Deadly Sins . ”
Is your website committing any one of these ?
1 ) They Fail to Connect
Traffic has been long touted to be the key to online success , but that 's not true .
If your site is not pulling sales , inquiries or results , then why would it need more traffic ?
The key is to turn curious browsers into serious buyers .
Aside from the quality of the copy , the number one reason why a website does n't convert is that the copy is targeting the wrong audience or fails to connect with them .
First , create a “ perfect prospect profile . ”
List all the attributes , characteristics and qualities of your most profitable and accessible market .
Do n't just stick with things like demographics and psychographics .
Try to get to know them .
Who are they , really ?
What are their most pressing problems ?
What keeps them up at night ?
How do they talk about their problems ?
Where do they hang out ?
Then , target your market by centering on a major theme , benefit or outcome so that , when you generate pre-qualified traffic , your hit ratio and your sales will increase dramatically .
Finally , ensure that your copy connects with them .
Intimately .
It speaks their language , talks about their problems , and tells stories they can easily appreciate and relate to .
Since this is the most common error that marketers and copywriters commit , and to help you , follow the following formulas .
The OATH formula helps you to understand the stage of awareness your market is at .
( How aware of the problem are they , really ? )
The QUEST formula guides you in qualifying and empathizing with them .
And the UPWORDS formula teaches you how to choose the appropriate language your market can easily understand , appreciate and respond to .
2 ) They Lack a Compelling Offer
“ Making an offer you can't refuse ” seems like an old cliché , but do n't discount its relevance and power .
Especially in this day and age where most offers are so anemic , lifeless , and like every other offer out there .
Too many business believe that simply offering a product or service , and mentioning the price , are good enough .
But what they fail to realize is that people need to intimately understand the full value ( the real value and , more importantly , the perceived value ) behind the offer .
Sometimes , all you need is to offer some premiums , incentives and bonuses to make the offer more palatable and hard to ignore .
( Very often , people buy products and services for the premiums alone . )
Other times , you need to create what is called a “ value buildup . ”
( In fact , premiums are not mandatory in all cases , particularly when the offer itself is solid enough .
But building value almost always is . )
Essentially , you compare the price of your offer not with the price of some other competing offer or alternative , but with the ultimate cost of not buying — and enjoying — your product or service .
This may include the price of an alternative .
But “ ultimate cost ” goes far beyond price .
Dan Kennedy calls this “ apples to oranges ” comparisons .
For example , let 's say you sell an ebook on how to grow better tomatoes .
That might sound simple , and your initial inclination might be to compare it to other “ tomatoe - growing ” ebooks or viable alternatives .
But also look at the the time it took for you to learn the best ways to grow tomatoes .
Look at the amount of money you invested in trying all the different fertilizers , seeds and techniques to finally determine which ones are the best .
Do n't forget the time , money and energy ( including emotional energy ) people save from not having to learn these by themselves .
Add the cost of doing it wrong and buying solutions that are either more expensive or inappropriate .
That 's what makes an offer valuable .
One people can't refuse .
3 ) They Lack “ Reasons Why ”
While some websites are well - designed and provide great content , and they might even have great copy , they fail because they do n't offer enough reasons for people to buy — or at least read the copy in the first place .
Visitors are often left clueless .
In other words , why should they buy ?
Why should they buy that particular product ?
Why should they buy that product from that particular site ?
And more important , why should they buy now ?
What makes your product so unique , different and special ?
What 's in it for your customers that they can't get anywhere else ?
Not answering those questions will deter clients and impede sales .
John E. Kennedy , a Canadian fireman and copywriter at the turn of the last century , talked a lot about the power of adding “ reasons why . ”
His wisdom still rings true to this day , and we know this from experience .
Once , my wife had a client whose website offered natural supplements .
It offered a free bottle ( i.e. , 30 - day supply ) .
But response was abysmal .
Aside from being in a highly competitive industry , the copy failed to allay the prospect 's fears .
They thought it might be a scam or that there 's a catch .
So all she did was tell her client to add the following paragraph :
“ Why are we offering this free bottle ?
Because we want you to try it .
We 're so confident that you will see visible results within 30 days that you will come back and order more . ”
Response more than tripled .
Similarly , add “ reasons why ” to your copy .
To help you , make sure that it covers all the bases by answering the following “ 5 why 's : ”
Why me ?
( Why should they listen to you ? )
Why you ?
( Who is perfect for this offer ? )
Why this ?
( Why is this product perfect for them ? )
Why this price ?
( Why is this offer so valuable ? )
Why now ?
( Why must they not wait ? )
4 ) They Lack Scarcity
Speaking of “ why now , ” this is probably the most important reason of all .
A quote from Jim Rohn says it all , and I force myself to think about it each time I craft an offer .
He said , “ Without a sense of urgency , desire loses its value . ”
People fear making bad decisions .
With spams , scams and snake oils being rampant on the Internet , people tend to procrastinate , and they do so even when the copy is good , the offer is perfect and they 're qualified for it .
Most websites I review fail to effectively communicate a sense of urgency .
If people are given the chance to wait or think it over , they will .
Look at it this way : if you do n't add a sense of urgency , you 're inviting them to procrastinate .
Use takeaway selling in order to stop people from procrastinating and get them to take action now .
In other words , shape your offer — and not just your product or service — so that it is time - sensitive or quantity - bound .
More important , give a reasonable , logical explanation to justify your urgency or else your sales tactic will be instantly discredited .
Back it up with reasons as to why the need to take advantage of the offer is pressing .
Plus , a sense of urgency does n't need to be an actual limit or a deadline .
It can be just a good , plausible and compelling explanation that emphasizes the importance of acting now — as well as the consequences of not doing so .
For example , what would they lose out on if they wait ?
Do n't limit yourself to the offer .
Think of all the negative side - effects of not going ahead right now .
5 ) They Lack Proof
Speaking of the fear of making bad decisions , today 's consumers are increasingly leery when contemplating offers on the Internet .
While many websites look professional , have an ethical sales approach , and offer proven products or services , the lack of any kind of tangible proof will still cause most visitors to at least question your offer .
The usual suspects , of course , are testimonials and guarantees .
Guarantees and testimonials help to reduce the skepticism around the purchase of your product or service , and give it almost instant credibility .
( I often refuse to critique any copy that does n't have any testimonials .
It 's not just to save myself time and energy .
I would be wasting my client 's money if the only recommendation they got from me was to add testimonials . )
Elements of proof is not just limited to guarantees and testimonials , either .
They can include the story behind your product , your credentials , actual case studies , results of tests and trials , samples and tours , statistics and factoids , photos and multimedia , “ seals of approval , ” and , of course , reasons why .
Even the words you choose can make a difference .
Because , in addition to a sense of urgency , your copy also needs a sense of credibility .
Today , people are understandably cynical and suspicious .
If your offer is suspect and your copy , at any point , gives any hint that it can be fake , misleading , untrue , too good to be true , or too exaggerated to be true …
… Then like it or not your response rate will take a nose dive .
So , help remove the risk from the buyer 's mind and you will thus increase sales — and , paradoxically , reduce returns as well .
Plus , do n't just stick with the truth .
You also need to give your copy the ring of truth .
To help you , follow my FORCEPS formula .
6 ) They Lack a Clear Call to Action
Answer this million - dollar , skill - testing question : “ What exactly do you want your visitors to do ? ” Simple , is n't it ?
But it does n't seem that way with the many sites I 've visited .
The KISS principle ( to me , it means “ keep it simple and straightforward ” ) is immensely important on the Internet .
An effective website starts with a clear objective that will lead to a specific action or outcome .
If your site is not meant to , say , sell a product , gain a customer or obtain an inquiry for more information , then what exactly must it do ?
Work around the answer as specifically as possible .
Focus on the “ power of one . ”
That is :
One message
One audience
One outcome
If your copy tells too many irrelevant stories ( irrelevant to the audience and to the advancement of the sale ) , you will lose your prospects ' attention and interest .
If it tries to be everything to everyone ( and is therefore either too generic or too complex ) , you will lose your prospects completely .
And if you ask your prospects to do too many things ( other than “ buy now ” or whatever action you want them to take ) , you will lose sales .
Use one major theme .
Make just one offer .
( Sure , you can offer options , such as ordering options or different packages to choose from .
But nonetheless , it 's still just one offer . )
Most important , provide clear instructions on where and how to order .
Aside from the lack of a clear call to action , asking them to do too many things can be just as counterproductive .
The mind hates confusion .
If you try to get your visitors to do too many things , they will do nothing .
Stated differently , if you give people too many choices , they wo n't make one .
So keep your message focused or else you will overwhelm the reader .
7 ) They Lack Good Copy
It may seem like this should be the number one mistake .
While it 's still one of the top seven mistakes , it 's last because the ones above take precedence .
If you 're guilty of making any of the previous six mistakes , in the end your sales will falter no matter how good your copy is .
Nevertheless , lackluster copy that fails to invoke emotions , tell compelling stories , create vivid mental imagery , and excite your prospects about your product or service is indeed one of the most common reasons websites fail .
Top sales trainer Zig Ziglar once said , “ Selling is the transference of enthusiasm you have for your product into the minds of your prospects . ”
Copy is selling in print .
Therefore , its job is no different .
In fact , since there 's no human interaction that you normally get in a face - to - face sales encounter , your copy 's job , therefore , has an even greater responsibility .
It must communicate that same enthusiasm that energizes your prospects , excites them about your offering and empowers them to buy .
Aside from infusing emotion into your copy , give your prospects something they can understand , believe in and act upon .
Like a trial lawyer , it must tell a persuasive story , make an airtight case and remove any reasonable doubt .
Above all , it must serve your prospect .
Many sites fail to answer a person 's most important question : “ What 's in it for me ? ”
They get so engrossed in describing companies , products , features or advantages over competitors that they fail to appeal to the visitor specifically .
Tell the visitor what they are getting out of responding to your offer .
To help you , first write down a series of bullets .
Bullets are captivating , pleasing to the eye , clustered for greater impact and deliver important benefits .
( They usually follow the words “ you get , ” such as “ With this product , you get . ” )
But do n't just resort to apparent or obvious benefits .
Dig deeper .
Think of the end - results your readers get from enjoying your product or service .
Do what my friend and copywriter Peter Stone calls the “ so that ” technique .
Each time you state a benefit , add “ so that ” ( or “ which means ” ) at the end , and then complete the sentence to expand further .
Let 's say your copy sells Ginko Biloba , a natural supplement that increases memory function .
( I 'm not a Ginko expert , so I 'm guessing , here .
Also , I 'm being repetious for the sake of illustration . )
Here 's what you might get :
Ginko supports healthy brain and memory functions … so that you can be clear , sharp and focused … so that you can stay on top of everything and not miss a beat … so that you can be a lot more productive at work … so that you can advance in your career a lot faster … so that you can make more money , enjoy more freedom , and have more job security … so that ( and so on ) .
That could have turned another way depending on the answer you give it , which is why it 's good to repeat this exercise .
Here 's another example :
Ginko supports healthy brain and memory functions … so that you can decrease the risks of senility , Alzheimer 's disease , and other degenerative diseases of the brain … so that you wo n't be placed in a nursing home … so that you wo n't place the burden of your care on your loved ones … so that you can grow old with peace of mind … so that you can enjoy a higher quality of life , especially during those later years … so that ( and so on ) .
Remember , these are just examples pulled off the top of my head .
But if you want more help with your own copy , my FAB formula is a useful guide .
Bottom line , check your copy to see if you 're committing any of these seven deadly sins .
If you are , your prospects wo n't forgive you .
By not buying , that is .

TEHRAN | Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caved into pressure from hard - line clerics and the country ’s supreme leader Friday and allowed the resignation of his top deputy after a weeklong standoff .
For days , the president had resisted pressure from hard - liners , including a direct order from the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , to dismiss his choice for the key post of first vice president , Esfandiar Rahim Mashai , who last year angered conservatives when he made friendly comments toward Israel .
The final blow , however , appeared to be the public reading on state television of the order issued earlier by Ayatollah Khamenei to dismiss Mr. Mashai because he is “ contrary to the interest of you and the government . ”
The issue created a rare rift between Mr. Ahmadinejad and the hard - liners that form the bedrock of his support and comes at a particularly sensitive time as he is battling opposition reformists who accuse him of winning the June 12 presidential elections through fraud .
“ After the announcement of the exalted supreme leader ’s order , Mashai does n’t consider himself first vice president , ” the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted presidential aide Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi as saying late Friday .
The resignation capped a day of renewed pressure that featured conservative student street demonstrations and Friday sermons railing against Mr. Mashai ’s appointment .
Despite all the pressure , Mr. Ahmadinejad had pleaded for more time to explain his reasons for choosing a man he had described as a “ pious , caring , honest and creative caretaker for Iran . ”
Mr. Mashai ’s son is married to the president ’s daughter .
The president even continued to back his man after his greatest supporter and the supreme leader of the country issued a private order Monday telling him that the appointment “ causes a rift and disillusionment among your supporters .
The aforementioned appointment must be canceled , and consider it null and void . ”
Reading the order publicly Friday dramatically increased the pressure on Mr. Ahmadinejad , and further refusal to act would have amounted to a flagrant and public defiance of the supreme leader .
The issue was also the topic of the main Friday prayer sermon in Tehran .
Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said that “ now that [ Ayatollah Khamenei ] has expressed his opinion , there is no room for delay anymore . ”
Ayatollah Khamenei has the final say over all state matters and has rarely faced defiance in the past .
That changed following last month ’s election , when supporters of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi challenged the supreme leader ’s ruling that the June 12 vote was fair .
The flap over the vice presidency appears to signal a move by Ayatollah Khamenei to entrench for himself an even more unquestionable status in the face of the reformist threat .
By demanding Mr. Mashai ’s removal , Ayatollah Khamenei is effectively appropriating a new power , since normally the supreme leader does not intervene openly to remove a government official , though he is believed to often vet appointments behind the scenes .
The president ’s brief defiance may have been out of fear of an attempt by hard - liners to dictate the government he is due to form next month .
Mr. Mashai angered hard - liners in 2008 when he said Iranians were “ friends of all people in the world - even Israelis . ”
He was serving as vice president in charge of tourism and cultural heritage at the time .
Iran has 12 vice presidents , but the first vice president is the most important because he succeeds the president if he dies , is incapacitated , steps down or is removed .
The first vice president also leads Cabinet meetings in the absence of the president .

" We want to know who was behind this , who had conspired it , who has financed it .

Cisco Systems today joins the elite circle of 30 blue - chip businesses that make up the Dow Jones industrial﻿ average , a move that may make it easier for the San Jose company to attract investors — at least initially .
Plus , in joining Intel and Hewlett - Packard on the list , Cisco is sure to get a boost in prestige .
But more than anything , experts say , the decision to replace General Motors with Cisco is recognition that technology is a primary innovator and spark plug of the nation ’s economy .
And that trend is turning heads everywhere from Wall Street to Washington .
“ It signals the ascendancy of Silicon Valley and high tech , ” said Stephen Levy of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy .
“ We ’re seeing older industries and companies be replaced by a sector that has substantial long - term growth prospects . ”
Technology already has the attention of President Barack Obama , who is actively promoting such ideas as smarter electricity grids and computerized health records .
And now , with Cisco , HP and Intel on the fabled stock index , along with IBM and Microsoft , elected officials may listen even more closely to the needs of Bay Area businesses , said Jim Wunderman , CEO of the Bay Area Council .
“ It certainly cements the tech industry in Silicon Valley as an integral part of the American economy , ” he said .
“ From a public policy basis , it has some impact .
I think it makes a stronger case in Washington and maybe in the state capitals . ”
Since its debut in 1896 , the Dow Jones industrial average has predominately featured so - called smokestack industries , from U.S. Rubber and Bethlehem Steel to Standard Oil and American Smelting .
However , reflecting a major shift in the nation ’s economy , those types of businesses have gradually given ground to firms offering products centered on computers , software and communications technology .
Officials with the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis say it ’s hard to say how much of the gross domestic product is represented by sales of such technology to consumers and the government .
But business purchases alone of such goods represented about 3 percent of the GDP in 2008 , compared with less than 1 percent in 1968 .
And one of the biggest up - and - comers in the tech field is Cisco , which was founded in 1984 and earned $ 8 billion on sales of nearly $ 40 billion during its most recent fiscal year .
Since the June 1 announcement that Cisco will replace GM , a part of the index for 83 years , the Internet - networking equipment maker ’s stock price has risen more﻿ than 7 percent , closing Friday at $ 19.87 .
That kind of increase is common after companies are first selected for the list , in part because some big institutions invest heavily in firms that are on such indexes , said Sybille Reitz , a Dow Jones spokeswoman .
“ It certainly does increase your visibility in the market , ” she said .
“ You ’re included among the bluest of the blue - chip companies in the United States . ”
But the share - price bump frequently is temporary , she said , adding , “ at the end of the day , it does n’t mean anything to their business or to their long - term stock price . ”
Although HP executives declined to discuss how they ’ve been affected by being placed on the list in 1997 , Intel , which got on two years later , has n’t seen much of an impact , according to spokesman Chuck Mulloy .
“ By and large , it ’s more prestige than anything substantive , ” he said .
John Roberts , director of Stanford ’s Center for Global Business and the Economy , also expressed skepticism that being on the index would mean significantly more business for Cisco or Silicon Valley .
After all , he said , “ very few people can tell you whether a given company is in the DJ30 .
I certainly cannot . ”
Still , in a prepared statement , Cisco officials said they are pleased at their inclusion .
Noting that today marks “ the first time in nearly 10 years that a technology company has been added to the Dow , ” the company said , “ We are honored with this recognition of our continued strong performance . ”

We talk a bit about how both the 360 and PS3 reduce their manufacturing costs by introducing new technology .
But what about the Wii ?
Well , of course , the Wii does the same thing .
Advertisement
It 's just been less of an issue , that 's all .
People follow that kind of stuff with the 360 and especially the PS3 because they want those machines to be cheaper , while the Wii , well , it 's been pretty cheap since it launched .
But in the years since then , as happens with every piece of consumer electronics , the cost to Nintendo to actually make the things has gone down .
And if Credit Suisse analyst Koya Tabata is to be believed , it 's gone down by around 45 % .
Advertisement
Meaning that , if Tabata 's numbers / sources are to be believed , it costs nearly half the price in 2009 that it did in 2006 to manufacture a Wii .
Which , yes , nearly doubles the profits they make on every console sold ( as shipping costs , etc remain the same ) .
So even with a topsy - turvy Yen and declining sales in Japan , do n't cry for Nintendo .
They 're still doing OK .

President Obama has committed to trying diplomacy to stop the Iranian bomb .
Time , though , is on the mullahs ' side , not least because so much of it was wasted after the 2007 U.S. National Intelligence Estimate made the improbable case that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
This assessment not only contradicted previous U.S. intelligence consensus but -- as recent court documents show -- also the conclusions of a key U.S. ally with excellent sources in Iran -- Germany .

Roger Federer was a broken man four months ago after losing an epic Australian Open final to Rafael Nadal , but any tears following his win in Paris would have been of joy after he cemented his place in tennis history .
The 27 - year - old beat Swedish surprise package Robin Soderling 6 - 1 7 - 6 6 - 4 in the French Open final to move level on 14 major victories with Pete Sampras and become only the sixth man to achieve the career Grand Slam .
" It 's up to the fans to judge whether it was the best ever , " says the modest and unassuming Federer .
He was hailed by Andre Agassi as " the best I 've ever played against " after he beat the American in his last professional match in the 2005 US Open final .
He has now joined the elite group of Fred Perry , Don Budge , Rod Laver , Roy Emerson and Agassi as the only men to clinch all four major titles .
Agassi , the only other man to achieve the feat in the Open era , believes his triumph confirms Federer 's status .
" It ends the discussion of where he fits in the history of the game , " said the 1999 Roland Garros champion .
" It 's not so much a question of Pete .
If it was n't for Nadal , he probably would have won a handful of these things , so nobody would underestimate where he deserves to fit in this game .
" This is going to mean so much to him , to have that hole filled .
I think it will change his life . "
Having lost the three previous finals at Roland Garros to Nadal , Federer must have wondered whether his time would ever come on the Paris clay .
But he has time and again proved himself to be a formidable figure in the face of adversity .
Misery
Federer in 2007 equalled Bjorn Borg 's record of five consecutive Wimbledon singles titles , defeating Nadal in five sets to also draw level with Borg and Laver on 11 Grand Slams .
His run of five successive Wimbledon titles came was ended last July by Nadal , who compounded the Swiss ' misery by relieving him of the world number one spot the following month .
" It was a fair battle , which was tough with the rain delays , " the Basle - born player said after Nadal 's 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 7 6 - 7 9 - 7 victory at SW19 .
" There were some great points and I think we both stayed tough until the very end .
" In tennis unfortunately there have to be winners and losers , there are no draws .
But it was probably my hardest loss by far .
It does n't get much harder than this . "
Demoted to second in the ATP rankings after an amazing 237 weeks at the top , Federer responded to his summer disappointments by beating Andy Murray in September 's US Open final to move within one triumph of equalling Sampras ' mark .
That quest was thwarted by Nadal in Melbourne , however , as the powerful Mallorcan battled out a thrilling 7 - 5 3 - 6 7 - 6 3 - 6 6 - 2 win to become Australian Open champion .
Federer was reduced to tears by his Melbourne Park heartache , saying during an emotional post - match speech : " God , this is killing me . "
He went on to pay tribute to his rival , who stepped up to the podium to console the beaten finalist in a show of great sportsmanship between the two best players on the planet .
Federer got through the presentation ceremony , but must have been left to ponder whether he had witnessed the changing of the guard with Nadal - five years his junior - now holding three of the four slams .
But he added a steely determination to his grace and elegance on the court to counter that fear and get himself back on the grand - slam trail .
Without an obvious flaw to his game , Federer 's greatest strength is perhaps his composure in the face of immense pressure .
It is difficult to imagine a more complete player - or a more worthy addition to the esteemed group of career Grand - Slammers .

Only a few hours left to Double your gift
Photo : Roger Smith via FlickrGrinnell Heritage Farm is 152 years old .
Andrew Dunham is the fifth generation of his family to work this land about 50 miles east of Des Moines .
He is a direct descendant of Josiah Grinnell , founder of the town and the man Horace Greeley once famously quoted as having said , “ Go west , young man , go west . ”
Andrew and his wife Melissa are a few months shy of receiving their formal certification as an organic farm .
Across the road , due north of their land , is a field of corn that is managed by the nearby Monsanto seed corn plant .
In Iowa and anywhere commodity corn is grown , it is common practice around this time of year to use chemicals to control fungus .
Often this is accomplished via the use of aerial application , commonly referred to as cropdusting .
On July 6th , a rustic - looking old biplane swooped in to spray Monsanto ’s field .
To put it mildly , the pilot ’s bombardiering skills were not what one would hope .
Dunham ’s crew was in the field picking broccoli and spinruts ( “ turnip ” backwards–a Japanese form of the root vegetable ) .
They witnessed the plane as it failed to shut off its spray mechanism in time , and the fungicide drifted into their tree planting and hay field .
“ The hay ground is in the third year of transition and would have become organically certified on September 1st , ” Andrew said .
Now , probably not .
You ’d think that this would be a clear - cut cause of action , as the legal folks would put it .
But the clever folks at Monsanto hire the crop dusters as contractors , and they in turn use a corporate shell with no assets , so when something like this happens and a victim sues , they simply file bankruptcy and then form a new corporation .
Iowa is the single most radically altered landscape in the country .
No state has changed more since the arrival of European settlers , and today the land is heavily “ mono - cropped . ”
Nature abhors a lack of diversity , but pathogens love it so farmers respond with more and stronger chemicals to fight off the bugs and weeds and fungi .
No one owns the airspace , so planes can fly over any land they choose .
Even if the pilots are incredibly accurate , Iowa is a windy place ( thus the massive increase in wind energy production here in recent years ) .
Drift is practically inevitable .
Last month in Mississippi , the Clarksdale Press - Register ran a story about the problem of chemical drift .
They spoke to a pilot :
Bob Howard , owner of Howard Flying Service , says crop dust pilots like himself are often unfairly singled out as the culprits of drift damage .
Howard points out many farmers apply herbicides and pesticides from ground rigs , which if done in high winds , is also susceptible to cause drift injury .
The risk of dusting an off - target field with Roundup is something Howard says is always in the back of his mind when working .
“ If everything was Roundup Ready it would be the greatest thing in the world , ” Howard said .
“ If they would all go to Roundup Ready or all go back to conventional farming it would sure be a lot easier on us . ”
I ’m not sure I would even know where to start with this guy , but let ’s try the part where he says that the risk is something that ’s “ always in the back of his mind . ”
The back ?
It ’s stunning that someone so obviously shortsighted was able to obtain a pilot ’s license .
His apathy toward his community and flagrant self - centered simple - mindedness are indicative of the unconscious conspiracy to which so many are a party .
They have all been bamboozled into believing in “ Better living through chemistry . ”
So much so , in fact , that the methods most farmers have used for a mere few decades are called “ conventional , ” and the few who practice farming as it was done for millennia are the outliers .
Monsanto ’s website even claims that they are “ Growing yield sustainably . ”
Farmers like Andrew Dunham can do little more than stand in their contaminated fields in stunned silence as Monsanto ’s contracted crop dusters continue to fly in the face of logic .
But Dunham and his family still manage to produce excellent food .
In defiance of negligent crop dusters , here ’s a simple and delicious recipe from the Heritage Farm newsletter .
Kale with olives
1 bunch kale , tough stems removed and leaves
chopped
2 - 4 Tbsp olive oil
Ground sea salt and black pepper
½ cup olives , chopped
Red pepper flakes and lemon wedges , optional
Simmer the kale in a skillet in about 4 cups boiling water .
Add salt and stir the greens until tender , about 10 - 15 minutes .
Drain the leaves , toss with the olive oil and add the olives , pepper , and red pepper flakes .
Serve hot with lemon wedges .

I often wonder what life would be like if the Luddites had n’t failed in their attempt to humanise progress .
But unfortunately they could n’t win .
For starters they were n’t an actual organised entity , just a collection of individuals who stood to loose most from , what was later termed , the Industrial Revolution .
They were up against those with the capital , the British government , ( predominately the same people ) , the British Army and the Police Force .
Even so it took hastily drafted draconian laws , quite a few hangings and a lot of violence to quell them .
We are living with their defeat today .
It ’s why we travel in peak hour droves to a place of work where we exchange large slabs of our lives for money .
Before the industrial revolution there was an organic economy based on land , labour and local exchange .
The weavers of the north of England were largely one - person home businesses .
Apart from producing woven goods , often with the involvement of his family , the weaver also had a small self - sufficient family vegetable garden .
Because of the quality and the demand for his manufactured goods , he was always assured that everything he produced would be sold at a constant price .
He and his family had abundance , stability and unrestrained social interaction .
Then along came more advanced technology which allowed the manufacture of goods , although inferior in quality , independent of nature , of geography and season and weather , of sun or wind or water or human and animal power .
It produced an economy based upon fuel , factory and foreign trade .
Humans became a minor consideration in the manufacture of goods and were now serving the machine .
It was this uncontrolled empowerment of the machine in human society that the Luddites fought against .
The people who formed the Luddite movement were mainly weavers or similar craftsmen .
They had the most to loose .
They fought for and lost their idyllic cottage industry lifestyle of stability and self - reliance .
The very quality of life that a lot of us yearn for today .
The combined power of weaving machines , the steam engine , the laws of enclosure that enabled industrialists to fence off farming land and build factories , put an end to the weavers way of life .
Whereas before the factories , agreed customary prices and therefore income were stable , the new technology brought with it a free market economy , which drove prices and wages down along with the quality of the product .
Life for the displaced farmers and weavers forced into the urban factories had become grim .
Working for long hours in dangerous conditions with no days off for very low pay , men , women and children spent their lives either working or sleeping .
Several families would have to share one house to save on rent .
Humans had become a disposable adjunct to the machine .
This is what the Luddites and those before them were against .
History is written by the victors , who were obviously not the Luddites , which is how the word has come to be used to mean a stupid person who does n’t understand and is opposed to advances in technology .
They were in fact very perceptive .
They could see what was going to happen to humanity .
And they were right .
Despite their valiant opposition we now have a collective mindset that says we must have a JOB and go to WORK for some one else .
It is now taken for granted that production and technological progress is more important than being human .
There was a brief time , with the advent of computers , that we all entertained the idea that computers would handle the more mundane tasks of modern life such that the working week would be reduced to three or four days , maybe less .
It ’s what the Luddites would have supported .
Did n’t happen .
The increased capacity that computers gave us was simply used to produce more , not improve humanity .
The amount of time many office workers spend away from home at a JOB has actually increased .
Interestingly a totally unplanned result of computer technology has given us all a chance to recreate the weaver ’s lifestyle .
I ’m referring to the internet .
There are those that have replaced the loom with the computer and yarn with broadband .
They have offices in their homes where they can interact with their families , live in a country environment where they can grow vegetables and keep chickens should they choose .
As for products they range from selling information to buying and selling on e-bay , trading in stocks and shares to advertising .
Thanks to appropriate technology , we have the opportunity to conduct business whilst packing the kids off to school , planting the spinach , feeding the chickens and maybe an afternoon delight between Google - ads !
Used this way the computer can give us more free time and at last live up to it ’s promise .
It ’s not much but I know that the mythical Ned Ludd would approve .
One of the key components of the pre-industrial revolution cottage industry was the merchant .
He was the entrepreneur .
He would travel from artisan to artisan supplying raw materials and collecting the finished produce that he would then on sell .
Today , using the same model , the weaver would also become the entrepreneur .
He or she would buy raw materials over the internet and sell the finished article the same way .
No need to travel town to town .
The weaver and family could live anywhere they like as long as they have access to the ‘ net .
This principle can be extended to a whole range of services and industries .
Of course , the new entrepreneur needs to be able to access the billions of potential customers that are waiting all around the world .
This requires an ability to attract people ( traffic ) to your website .
One of the best ways to do this that I know of can be accessed through the ad in the top left hand corner o f this page .
So , and ironically through the use of modern technology , the Luddites dream of sustainable cottage industries is re-born .
You ’ll have to excuse me now , I ’ve just got to go and see what arrived in the bank account today and collect some eggs .
Might dig some potatoes as well .
Where ’s that garden fork ?

Here is spectacular footage of an underwater volcano erupting near Tonga .
The eruption began Monday after a series of earthquakes near Tonga , a 170 - island archipelago between Australia and Tahiti , residents told the Associated Press .
There were magnitude - 5.0 quakes there Sunday night and Monday afternoon , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
Though the Wellington Volcanic Ash Advisory Center ( VAAC ) issued an advisory for the area , the plume is n’t engendering island residents and so far has n’t hurt fish or other animals , according to the AP .
Yesterday a plume rose to between 15,000 and 25,000 feet ( 4.6 to 7.6 kilometers ) , the Smithsonian ’s Global Volcanism Program reported .
“ It ’s a very significant eruption , on quite a large scale , ” Tonga ’s chief geologist , Kelepi Maf , told the Times of London .
This is not unusual for this area and we expect this to happen here at any time . ”

This comes from the Angelqueen Catholic forum :
These two come from the same commenter :
Sanctity .
Your thoughts
To that commentator - BULLSH*T and remember the days - unfortunately too long ago - when catholics ( and probably their holy rosaries ) were burned at the stake - - with comments like yours I sometimes think I long for those days !
PS I 'm GAY and proud of it and I 'm a much better catholic than you are - you certainly DO NOT follow the teachings of Jesus Christ ( I 'd say a Satan follower ) - - since you are such a believer ( YEAH , RIGHT ) I would not look forward to your Judgment Day .

So the Holy Rosary is the Catholic version of the Holy Spirit .
As a former member of the church , I never thought bead necklaces granted wishes .
I guess that 's why Catholic priests are so straight * sarcasm * .

Fortunately , the polls show that lay catholics are slightly more liberal than the general population .

In fairness , this website is inspired by the uber - traditional Society of St. Pius X ( SSPX ) .
SSPX is in schism with the Catholic Church and definitely stuck in a pre-Vatican II mindset .
For any Catholic this is easy to see from a quick perusal of the site .

God does n't create Sodomites ?
That 's not what the New Testament says : Romans I 1:26 -32 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201;&version=9;
God took the non-believers and made them Gay so that they would be attacked and killed .
" 26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature : 27 And likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ; 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , debate , deceit , malignity ; whisperers , 30 Backbiters , haters of God , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents , 31 Without understanding , covenantbreakers , without natural affection , implacable , unmerciful : 32 Who knowing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them . "

so ... if you 're gay and do n't practice sodomy is it still a sin ?
after all , about a third of gay men do n't practice anal sex of any kind .
There are actually way more straight people who practice it .

Janet Napolitano was right to apologize to America for being so mean to the right wing .
Yesterday , did anyone think a white supremacist would commit an act of terrorism in the Holocaust Museum ?
Or an abortion clinic ?
Or an immigration center ?
Cooler heads always prevail - the greatest signal that gay rights will come to be is that the right is coming * unglued * these days .

Simply , where does the bible tell us to kill gays ?
Were not in the old testament , were in a new covenant , the laws in levi and deut are not for today , or else wed all be dead already straight or gay .
I could call myself a christian and do many things that is not condoned in the bible , doesnt mean anything .
80 % of america thinks they are christian , prob 30 % actually are saved .
Sad but true .
If you want to be saved , repent and believe .
If not dont .
But no " real " christian will ever ever do you harm for being gay .
If a christian threatens a gay with death , he is not a christian , or severely backsliding .
Its simply not biblical to harm gays if you understand how to separate the old and new testaments .
Although it is Sin just as drunkenness and straight adultery .

newsflash - leviticus was written more than 2000 years ago by people who believed that plants were talking to them .
it has zero relevance today , unless you 're using it to prop up a pre-existing personal feeling about something .
in which case , it 's a human opinion and not a divine one .

" vile affections " and " that which is unseemly " can mean ANYTHING you want them to mean .
So it 's purely subjective to interpret them as references to homosexuality .

Move over cable TV , because the Internet is taking a step towards becoming a true cable replacement .
TV streaming site Hulu plans to offer a live stream of a Dave Matthews Band concert on June 1 — the site 's first - ever live music concert .
While the site has previously streamed certain live events , such as the 2008 presidential debates , the Dave Matthews Band concert marks the beginning of live - streamed entertainment , chipping away at the appeal of paying a monthly cable TV bill .
The live concert will begin at 9:00 pm ET on June 1 at Hulu .
Because of the partnership , Hulu will begin offering various music videos leading up to the show , and after the concert is over , the site will continue offering on - demand streaming access .
" Dave Matthews Band is honored to partner with Hulu in this groundbreaking venture , " Dave Matthews Band manager Coran Capshaw said in a statement .
Whether or not you 're a Dave Matthews Band fan , the move is significant in that it's the first major streaming " event " for a mainstream entertainment act .
Sure , President Obama 's face has graced our computers live many times over the last year or so , but as PaidContent points out , those speeches and debates were offered as a public service .
Certainly cable providers do n't need to panic after just one streaming concert , but if the trend continues , the Internet will no longer be relegated to playing the role of the red - headed stepchild of TV content .
For the time being , though , the traditional boob tube still dominates when it comes to the public 's TV viewing habits .
Ratings firm Nielsen recently noted that the number of Web and mobile video viewers is up , but nearly 99 percent of all video is still watched on a TV screen .
Americans are watching more TV than ever , too — both online and off — averaging about 153.5 hours in front of the idiot box and three hours via the Internet every month .
Clearly , the television is still king — for now .

Some really smart people in white coats have discovered a new material that is harder than diamonds and conducts electricity 100 times better than silicon .
Sounds great right ?
Did I mention it is also only one atom thick ?
Once you put those together you have the makings of something to set the computer and IC world on its ear .
The new material is being called graphene and is pure carbon .
It is being earmarked for use in touch screens , solar cells and of course high performance computer chips .
The time when we will have graphene in our computers is still a long way off though .
As it stands right now scientists have only recently figured out how to make it efficiently .
Before they actually had to mount carbon atoms onto tape and then peel the take away to get the graphene layer .
Still there is hope that in the near - term hybrid graphene silicon devices will popup and improve the current silicon only products we use .
Update * The prinicple behind Graphene was first theorized in 1947 .
2004 was the first time someone actually pulled a 2D sheet of graphene from a graphite composite .
This was proven conclusively to be possible in 2005 .
In 2007 the first transitor made of Graphene was produced In 2008 a new method for creating Graphene was found .
When it comes to the amount of sheer planning , creativity , and outright lunacy that goes into them , few crimes rival the high profile , multi-million dollar heist .
And when you consider the colorful characters and criminal masterminds behind these robberies , it ’s easy why these crimes continue to be the subject of constant speculation and fascination .
Whether the work of teams of highly trained thieves , lowly bank managers , or even a powerful dictator , here are ten of the biggest and most bizarre heists and burglaries in history .
10 . The Great Train Robbery
One of the most famed heists in popular culture , The Great Train Robbery was one of the biggest robberies of all time when it was committed in 1963 .
The heist took place in Buckinghamshire , England , when a mail train transporting millions of pounds was boarded by a team of 15 robbers .
The thieves used a fake signal light to stop the train , and after subduing the workers inside the first two carriages , loaded 120 mail bags containing 2.6 million pounds into some cars they had hidden near the tracks .
The men all escaped the scene , but 13 of them were quickly captured following an extensive investigation by Scotland Yard .
Two of the these men , Ronnie Biggs and Charlie Wilson , would later escape from prison and flee the country .
Wilson was caught four years later in Canada , but Biggs famously eluded capture by hiding out in Brazil , and he was only apprehended when he turned himself in to authorities in 2001 .
9 . The Agricultural Bank of China Robbery
2007 ’s Agricultural Bank of China Robbery resulted in the theft of 51 million yuan ( roughly $ 7 million U.S. ) , and it is said to be the biggest robbery in China ’s history .
The scheme started when the bank ’s manager , Ren Xiaofeng , stole 200,000 yuan from the vault .
His unlikely plan was to use the money to buy massive amounts of lottery tickets in the hope of winning a cash prize and returning the money before it was reported missing .
Amazingly , the plan worked , and Ren made a huge profit off of his gamble even after returning the 200K .
After enlisting the help of another manager , Ma Xiangjing , Ren proceeded to steal nearly 33 million yuan a year or so later , and a month after that another 18 million .
In both cases , the men spent nearly all the money on lottery tickets , but they were only able to recoup 98,000 yuan , and the missing money was quickly noticed and reported .
Ren and Ma were eventually captured , but very little of the stolen money was ever recovered , thanks to the astronomical amounts the duo had spent on lotto tickets .
8. The Great Brinks Robbery
When it was committed in 1950 , the $ 2.7 million Brinks Robbery in Boston , Mass . was the biggest heist in American history .
Dubbed “ the crime of the century , ” the heist was the work of an 11 - man gang who used copied keys to gain entry into the Brinks Building .
Once inside , they made their way to a room where employees were counting money , and after subduing the armed guards , collected $ 1.2 million in cash , along with another $ 1.5 million in checks and securities .
The gang ’s plan had been to sit on the money for six years , at which point the statute of limitations for armed robbery would have run out , but a police investigation quickly started turning up suspects .
After a few of the men were arrested , the criminals started turning on one another , even going so far as to hire hit men and attempt drive - by shootings on suspected snitches .
Eventually , though , all eleven of the original robbers were found out and arrested , and many received life sentences in prison .
7. The Gardner Museum Art Heist
In the biggest art heist in history , two men dressed as police officers managed to con their way into the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum in Boston late one night in 1990 .
Once inside , the men overpowered the few guards on duty , tied them up , and left them in the basement .
They then proceeded to steal several pieces of artwork by Rembrandt , Degas , Manet , and Vermeer , along with a few sculptures and historical artifacts .
The total haul is now valued at $ 500 million , but both the thieves and the artwork have yet to be found .
A number of possible suspects have been considered , from Boston crime boss James “ Whitey ” Bulger to the IRA , but no arrests have been made in connection to the case .
Enough time has passed that the statute of limitations on the actual heist has passed , leaving the Gardner Museum art heist as one of the most successful and mysterious robberies of all time .
6. The Central Bank Of Iraq Heist
For sheer amount of currency stolen , no robbery compares to the Central Bank Of Iraq heist , which is said to have been perpetrated by none other than Saddam Hussein .
The robbery happened just before the U.S. bombing of Iraq in 2003 .
In the middle of the night , a small group of men led by Hussein ’s son , Qusay , went to the Central Bank with tractor - trailers and forcibly withdrew just under 1 billion dollars cash .
Nearly $ 650 million of this was eventually found stashed in the walls of Hussein ’s palace by U.S. soldiers .
A handwritten note was later discovered linking Saddam and his son to the heist , but just who the other men involved were or what became of the remaining $ 350 million remains a mystery .
5 . The Baker Street Burglary
The Baker Street burglary took place in London in 1971 , when a team of well - equipped thieves tunneled into the Baker Street Bank and stole 3 million pounds worth of cash and valuables from safety deposit boxes .
The criminals used a combination of metal cutting tools and explosives to tunnel to the vault from a nearby shop , and even had a lookout positioned on a nearby rooftop .
Near the end of the heist , a ham radio operator overheard some of the lookout ’s radio transmissions and contacted the police , who frantically searched over seven hundred banks within the area in hopes of honing in on the location of the transmission .
They were unable to catch the robbers at the time , but nearly two years later a number of men were charged in connection with the robbery , though police believe the true mastermind behind the crime was never captured .
4. The Harry Winston Heist
One of the most downright brazen robberies in recent memory , the Harry Winston Heist went down in 2008 when a group of four men stormed into one of Paris ’s most exclusive jewelry stores and made off with $ 108 million in diamonds .
The men were disguised as women and armed with a .357 Magnum and a hand grenade .
They quickly herded the employees and customers into a corner and started breaking open display cases , and after filling a suitcase with precious stones , made their escape .
No one from this robbery has been arrested , but police suspect that the robbers– whom they ’ve nicknamed “ The Pink Panthers ” – are a part of a larger criminal organization of Yugoslavians that may have been responsible for a number of other high profile jewelry heists .
In the meantime , a $ 1 million dollar reward is still up for grabs for any information leading to the arrest of the thieves .
3. The Knightsbridge Security Deposit Robbery
One of the boldest and most successful robberies of all time , the Knightsbridge Security Deposit heist happened in London in 1987 , when career criminal Valerio Viccei and a small group of accomplices armed with guns managed to make off with 60 million pounds in valuables and cash from safe deposit boxes .
The thieves got into the vault by pretending to rent a safe deposit box of their own , and once inside they managed to overpower the employees and security guards and start breaking into the boxes .
They escaped without incident , but a bit of blood left behind at the scene allowed police to trace the robbery back to Viccei , who was wanted for a huge amount of robberies in his native Italy .
Viccei ’s accomplices were quickly arrested , but he fled the country and for some time eluded capture .
A known playboy and high roller , he was only arrested after he returned to England in an attempt to retrieve his prized Ferrari sports car .
2. The Banco Central Burglary
Considered to be among the biggest bank heists of all time , the Banco Central burglary took place in 2005 in Fortaleza , Brazil .
The robbery was the result of painstaking planning by a small gang of burglars who tunneled over 250 feet to the bank ’s vault from a nearby property .
The robbers used a landscaping business as a front for their operation , an ingenious cover that allowed them to move massive amounts of dirt and rock out of the tunnel without looking suspicious .
The tunnel itself was expertly constructed , and was said to have sophisticated lighting and even an air conditioning system .
After three months of digging , the thieves finally broke into the vault and made off with over 165 million in Brazilian reals , or $ 70 million dollars U.S.
Since then , police have made a number of arrests in connection with the burglary , and recovered roughly $ 9 million dollars of the haul , but the majority of the suspects are still at large .
1. The Antwerp Diamond Heist
Antwerp , Belgium is one of the diamond capitals of the world , with 80 percent of the world ’s diamonds passing through the city before being sold on the market .
A number of heists have taken place there , most recently a still - unsolved $ 28 million robbery in 2007 , but the biggest of them all took place in 2003 , when a team of master criminals known as the School of Turin managed to walk away with $ 100 million in uncut diamonds from the Antwerp Diamond Center vault .
For sheer scope , ingenuity , and risk , few robberies will ever measure up to this one .
The criminals had been planning the heist for years , and using copied keys and faked security camera footage , they managed to bypass the vault ’s multi-million dollar security system , which had been thought to be impenetrable .
The thieves escaped without incident , but DNA left at the scene allowed them to be tracked to Italy , where most of the gang has since been captured .
The $ 100 million in diamonds , meanwhile , seems to have disappeared for good .

FORT CAMPBELL , Kentucky ( CNN ) --
The 101st Airborne 's senior commander in effect ordered his soldiers Wednesday not to commit suicide , a plea that came after 11 suicides since January 1 , two of them in the past week .
An Army honor guard stands ready to fire a salute at Fort Campbell .
" If you do n't remember anything else I say in the next five or 10 minutes , remember this -- suicidal behavior in the 101st on Fort Campbell is bad , " Brig .
Gen. Stephen J. Townsend told his forces .
" It 's bad for soldiers , it 's bad for families , bad for your units , bad for this division and our army and our country and it's got to stop now .
Suicides on Fort Campbell have to stop now . "
Fort Campbell 's suicide rate , the highest in the Army , " is not a good statistic , " he said in remarks to one of four divisions he addressed during the day .
After nearly one soldier per week committed suicide at the post between January and mid-March , the Army instituted a suicide prevention program that " seemed to be having good effects " until last week , when two more suicides occurred , he said .
" Suicide is a permanent solution to what is only a temporary problem , " Townsend said .
" Screaming Eagles do n't quit .
No matter how bad your problem seems today , trust me , it 's not the end of the world .
It will be better tomorrow .
Do n't take away your tomorrow . "
He urged anyone feeling hopeless or suicidal to " tell somebody . "
" You would n't hesitate to seek medical attention for a physical injury or wound ; do n't hesitate to seek medical attention for a psychological injury . "
Townsend exhorted any soldier who suspects that a fellow soldier may be feeling suicidal to act -- first by asking how the soldier feels , then by escorting him or her to help .
" Do not wait , " he said .
Soldiers can turn to their leaders , chaplains , medics , social workers , teammates , family and friends , he said .
" Do n't let yourself , your buddies or your families down , " he said , ending his comments by repeating , " This has got to stop , soldiers .
It 's got to stop now .
Have a great week . "
But Townsend 's message -- called a Second Suicide Stand - Down event -- is likely to be ineffective , said Dr. Mark Kaplan , a professor of community health at Portland State University in Oregon , who has researched veterans ' suicide and served last year on a Veterans Administration blue - ribbon panel on suicide risk .
" It sounds like an order , " he told CNN in a telephone interview .
" I 'm not sure that a command like this is going to alter the course of somebody who is on a trajectory of self - harm . "
He suggested the Army might want to adopt the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs model .
" They 're dealing with a comparable problem with a similar population , " Kaplan said .
" They have infused more sensitivity to their approach to suicide prevention as opposed to this .
This is like any other order . "
The military culture attaches a stigma to mental illness that needs to be reduced , he said .
Soldiers who acknowledge they are considering suicide can suffer severe repercussions , such as losing opportunities for promotion and access to firearms , he said .
If the Army is serious about addressing the problem , it needs to address the stressors common to soldiers , including financial problems , marital problems , frequency of deployments , length of deployments , deployments to hostile environments , exposure to extreme stress and service - related injuries , he said .
The role of alcohol too must be addressed if the rate of suicide is to be lowered , he said .
" More often than not , these are individuals who 'll get liquored up , so to speak , and have access to a gun and die from a self - inflicted gunshot wound , " Kaplan said .
Bill Lichtenstein , who serves on the board of the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism , the advisory council of the Center for the Advancement of Children 's Mental Health at Columbia University , and on the advisory board of Families for Depression Awareness , was equally unimpressed with Townsend 's tack .
" It 's the equivalent of ' Just Say No ' to prevent drug abuse , ' " he told CNN in a telephone interview .
Screening techniques that involve a series of questions are available to identify people at risk for suicide , he said .
" Prominent among them , if not the most important question is : Have you made a plan for suicide ?
Using a simple battery of questions , you can suss out people who might be at risk , which is far more important than telling somebody , ' Do n't take your life , ' " Lichtenstein said .
The problem is not limited to Fort Campbell .
The Army has reported 64 potential active - duty suicides this year ; 35 have been confirmed as suicides , and 29 are pending determination of manner of death .

After taking a verbal beat down from Rick Sanchez on CNN for his completely false claim that only Anderson Cooper covered the recent murder of Army recruiter William Long , host Bill O’Reilly sort of apologized to CNN tonight for his mistake .
It is a sort of apology because he called Sanchez snide , and promised to have more about CNN ’s coverage on his Monday show .
Here is the video of O’Reilly correcting his mistake from Media Matters :
Advertisements
Earlier in the day , Sanchez completely obliterated O’Reilly ’s bogus claim on CNN :
Sanchez said ,
“ Let ’s add this up together now .
We led with the story when it broke .
We led with it again the next day .
We analyzed the terrorism angle with experts , and called former FBI agents to take us through it , and as a network we covered the story umpteen times throughout the days , throughout all hours of the days , but Bill O’Reilly says he only saw it once , and since he only saw it once , well then , that must be the truth .
It does n’t matter what really happened .
It does n’t matter what the record shows , all that matters is what Bill thinks he saw . ”
O’Reilly said , “ I do want to tell you one thing also .
We have a correction , a rare correction on The Factor .
Earlier this week I said only Anderson Cooper covered the murder of Private Long in Arkansas .
Well today a snide and surly guy on CNN pointed out that the story was covered more extensively by that network and that is true .
I was wrong , my apologies to CNN .
I was talking about primetime , but I did not say that , so I was wrong , as they say in third grade , my bad .
Now on Monday we ’ll have more on how CNN handled the Private Long and Tiller story , going to make a comparison , so do n’t miss that . ”
O’Reilly apologized after being confronted with video evidence that CNN did at least a dozen reports on the subject .
Of course , it was a backhanded apology , because he had to insult Rick Sanchez , by calling him snide and surly .
I did n’t think that Sanchez was snide or surly .
I thought he and CNN were justifiably angry at O’Reilly ’s obvious distortion .
O’Reilly comparison on Monday is guaranteed to be hit job on CNN .
Look for O’Reilly to claim liberal bias at the network , as he compares their coverage of the Tiller and Long stories .
O’Reilly will try to get his revenge against CNN for embarrassing him , but any embarrassment could have easily been avoided if somebody on his show would have bothered to fact check .
Once again , FNC ’s aversion to facts comes back to bite them in the backside .

For years , I had a hard time getting over the price hurdle of organics .
The only reasons I 'd ever heard for avoiding pesticides were health - related , and I tend to tune out when people step onto their " This is really bad for your health " soapbox .
Let 's face it , everything is bad for our health .
It 's overwhelming !
You do n't even want to know what I learned the other day about cell phones ...
So if health was the only reason to switch to organics , I would have kept on saying that the price was n't worth it .
But since starting this blog , I 've learned that there are plenty of other reasons to choose organics over conventionally grown produce and factory - farm raised meats .
Maybe one of these will appeal to you :
1. Organics taste better .
Many top chefs prefer using organics in their cooking and restaurants , citing superior quality .
I can't say I 've noticed a taste difference in all organic products , but I can vouch for organic cheese over conventional cheese .
And if I had known how much yummier organic sugar is over conventional sugar , I would have started buying that years ago .
2. Organics pack a nutritional punch .
Recent studies have found that organic foods contain more nutrients than conventionally grown and raised foods , including Vitamin C , iron , zinc , and cancer - fighting antioxidants .
Nutrient - rich soil equates to nutrient - rich plants , which leads to healthier animals and healthier people .
3. Organics protect soil quality .
Years of monocropping and intensive use of synthetic fertilizers depletes soil quality and leads to massive topsoil erosion .
On the other hand , sustainable farming methods generally used by organic farmers - such as rotating crops , planting cover crops , and composting - protect and replenish the nutrients in soil .
4. Organics protect water quality .
Chemical fertilizer run off causes algae overgrowth , leading to huge ocean " dead zones " ( areas where the water on the ocean floor has so little oxygen that marine life can no longer survive there ) .
Scientists estimate that there are now 400 dead zones in the ocean , covering a combined area half the size of California .
Additionally , chemical pesticides and intensive livestock farming contribute to water pollution .
5. Organics promote biodiversity .
Industrial farming focuses on a handful of crops , choosing the varieties that are hardiest and stand up to shipping rather than those that taste best .
Many organic farmers , on the other hand , grow a variety of plants , including heirloom varieties with interesting colors , textures , and tastes .
6. Organics support small farmers .
Although more and more large , industrial - type farms are becoming certified organic , most organic farms are still small - scale , independently owned , and family run .
Keep in mind that not all farmers that use organic farming techniques are certified organic .
Becoming certified is a cost many struggling small farmers can't afford .
So ask your local farmers about their methods for pest control and fertilization , focusing more on sustainability and less on certification .
7 . And , oh yeah , organics are grown without all those unhealthy chemicals .
Some studies have indicated that children are especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of pesticide exposure because their bodies are still developing and they eat more for their size than grown - ups .
( My five - year - old and four - year - old generally eat more calories a day than I do , and they are walking sticks ! )
I 'm not going to pretend that the organics system is perfect .
In many ways , Big Organic
Ag is treading along the well - worn path of traditional Industrial Ag . ( An organic CAFO is still a CAFO , and " organic " junk food is no healthier than any other junk food . )
But organics are one step toward fixing our messed - up agricultural system , and it's a step we need to take if we want a better future for our children and for the planet .

Digital Britain The Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) is a British success story - and one that our government would dearly like to export overseas .
Although it would rather not pay for it , if it can possibly avoid doing so .
That is the somewhat Johnny Bullish assessment of how we regulate the internet here in dear old Blighty , taken from the pages of Lord Carter 's report on " Digital Britain " ( pdf ) .
It contains , as most such reports do , lavish praise for the gallant souls slaving away at the IWF - combined with little obvious understanding of the issues involved .
First the praise .
According to Lord Carter 's report , " the Internet Watch Foundation and the ‘ notice and take down ’ system on Internet sites is widely regarded internationally as a model . "
This is true as far as it goes - but possibly overlooks the fact that as one of the first such organisations into the fray , other jurisdictions have been in mad catch - up mode ever since .
However , there is a fly in the ointment : " The IWF ’s current income includes a contribution from the EU Safer Internet 66 Action Plan with the bulk being derived from voluntary membership subscriptions .
" This voluntary structure means that there is no certainty that the level of funding received now from the EU or from its membership will continue at this level in the future .
In the current economic climate a voluntary funding base carries with it increased uncertainty over funding . "
So , perhaps the current model is not quite as brilliant as it is cracked up to be ?
Fear not : " the Government is challenging the industry to ensure that it has one " .
Challenging , that is , as in " if the regulation of criminal content is not adequately funded by industry , Government would need to consider statutory intervention " .
So it ’s a good model - except when it comes to funding .
However , as the report is keen to repeat , " the IWF has also been a model for international hotlines for reporting child abuse material , especially across the EU .
Some operators already use its list of illegal sites internationally .
Since most child abuse material originates outside the EU , there is a case for its operations to cover at least the whole of the EU .
" We will therefore explore with the IWF and the European Commission the scope for a pan-European model with commensurate funding . "
There 's the land grab : if government can obtain sufficient funding both from industry and the EU , our loveable , cuddly British IWF could soon be patrolling the murkier backwaters of the European internet too .
This would be a step - change to the operation that the IWF currently runs , given both the number of countries involved and the subtle differences in law between states in terms of what is criminal to view .
It also overlooks a very large obstacle .
The IWF is praised internationally for its work and its achievement in bringing down the proportion of child abuse sites hosted within the UK to 1 % of the total accessed .
That is a serious success story that is not without its critics .
Issues that we have reported on previously include the lack of judicial involvement in the process : the failure to notify site owners , and overall , a typically British lack of legislative grounding for the operation .
It is a fudge that has worked : and it has been considered a model for other countries because for some time it has been the main - if not the only - game in town .
Over the last year , this picture has been changing rapidly , with debates in several EU states , including Belgium , Germany and Denmark as to how the internet should be regulated .
Debate has focused around issues of control and the level of government involvement in the eventual solution .
In Germany , a proposal for an IWF lookalike has been roundly rebuffed in favour of a model with greater judicial oversight .
So full marks to Lord Carter for delivering praise where praise is due : but " nuls points " for this blatant attempt to foist a British model on everyone else in Europe without first checking that it fits their own concerns . ®
The number of coffee shops , restaurants , and other stores that are offering free wireless internet access to their customers through 802.11B / G/N technologies ( more commonly known as WiFi ) has seen a dramatic increase in the last few years .
In just about every major metropolitan “ down town ” area , you ’ll be hard - pressed to find a location where there is n’t a WiFi signal available .
These publically available are very convenient , but if you ’re not careful using them , they can leave you open to become a victim of identity theft .
If you only use your laptop to browse your favorite news sites and check your personal email , you probably do n’t have a ton to worry about .
However , if you use your bank ’s online banking service , login to your PayPal account , login to your eBay account , or login anywhere that money could potentially be transacted then you need to take certain precautions to make sure that you are on a secure connection .
So how do you protect yourself ?
First , remember that you are on the exact same network as everyone else in the room without a firewall in - between you .
If you have any shared folders on your computer , they can probably access them .
You ’ll want to turn on the Windows Firewall or use your own firewall solution and turn off any shared folders that you might have open .
You ’ll also want to make sure that your copy of Windows ( or whatever operating system that you ’re using ) is up to date and has the latest security patches .
Second , if you ’re going to logon to your bank ’s website , your eBay account , your PayPal account or your investment account , make sure that their website is using SSL .
This stands for “ secure socket layer ” and essentially encrypts the communication between you and the bank .
That way , if you were to type in your password and send it off to eBay for validation , nobody except eBay would be able to see the network traffic that you are generating which will validate your password .
You can make sure that you are on a secure connection if the URL you are on starts with “ https ” rather than HTTP .
You need to be especially careful as some are prone to banking scams especially seniors .
If you have access to a business or corporate VPN , you should make use of it .
A Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) offers you a secure way to communicate with your home or work ’s network .
This will add another layer of encryption your network traffic and make it , in all practicality , impossible for anyone to see the network traffic that you are sending over the air .
You can also use services such as OpenVPN and HotSpot VPN if you do n’t have a VPN available at work .
These will safely encrypt your wireless network traffic .
Some hackers have been known to create their own “ access points ” and attempt to get unsuspecting victims to connect to them .
In doing this , they are acting as a pass - through and collecting all of the information that you are sending through the connection , including any passwords that you send to insecure websites .
You need to make sure that the network you are connected to is legitimate .
You can do this by making sure that the SSID ( the name of the wireless network ) matches up with the name of the store that you are at .
If you are not using the internet , shut off your wireless network card .
This will prevent it from automatically connecting to a network that you did n’t intend to .
It ’s also a good idea to run a security suite such as AVG ( it ’s free ) , that will let you know if you ’ve been infected with any sort of Trojan or other virus .

Although the most popular area for eating paella here is by the sea , this is not necessarily where the best restaurants are found .
In fact , the best place to eat paella in Valencia is in more far - flung , rural areas .
So , without further ado , allow us to take you on a culinary tour of the best paella restaurants in Valencia .
This is a best example of simplicity .
Can we expect our politicians to be like the Iranian President ?
God loves those who are humble in their personal life too !
The Fox News TV ( US ) asked the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ; " When you look into the mirror in the morning what do you say to yourself ? "
He answered : I see the person in the mirror and tells him " Remember , you are no more than a small servant , ahead of you today is the heavy responsibility , and that is to serve the Iranian nation " .
And this was how the broadcaster introduced him .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the Iranian President who astonished many when he first reached to the office of the Presidency by donating all the high valued Iranian carpets to one of the mosques in Tehran by replacing them with the low - cost ordinary carpets .
He observed that there was a huge extravagant langue for receiving and welcoming the VIPs and he ordered it to be closed and asked the protocol office to arrange for an ordinary room instead with the wooden chairs , though more impressive in fact !
On many instances , he joins the cleaning staff of the municipality for cleaning the streets in the area where his home and the Presidency office locates .
Under his authority whenever he appoints any minister to his post he gets a signed document from him with many points , particularly highlighting that he shall remain poor and that his personal and his relatives accounts will be watched and the day he leaves the ministry shall be with dignity , and therefore it is not lawful for him or his relatives to take any advantage of his office .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was born on October 28 , 1956 .
He is the 6th and current president of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
He became president on 6 August 2005 after winning the 2005 presidential election .
Ahmadinejad 's current term will end in August 2009 , but he will be eligible to run for one more term in office in 2009 presidential elections .
Before becoming president , he was the Mayor of Tehran .
First of all , he declared himself all the " Big " wealth and property he owned was a Peugeot 504 car , model 1977 , an old small house inherited from his father forty years ago in one of the poorest zones in Tehran .
His accounts with a zero balance and the only money come into his a /c was from his salary from the university as a lecturer with an amount of US $ 250 only .
For your information , the President still lives in that same house .
This is all that he owns ; the president of one of the world 's important countries ; strategically , economically , politically and with regard to its oil and defense .
He even does n't take his personal salary with the argument that all the wealth belongs to the nation and he is the safeguard over it .
One of the things that impressed the staff at the presidency is the bag the president brings with him every day , which contains his breakfast ; some sandwiches or bread with olive oil and cheese prepared by his wife and eats and enjoys it with all happiness ,
While he stopped all the deliveries of the special food used to come for the president .
One of the other things he changed was his personal carrier " The President 's Aircraft " to a cargo aircraft in order to save the spending from the public treasury and he ordered that he will be flying with the ordinary airline in the economic class .
He organizes meetings every now and then with all the ministers to know their activities and efficiency and he closed down the office of the manager of the president and any minister can enter to his office without any permission .
He also stopped the welcome ceremonies like the red carpet , the photo session or any personal advertisement or respect of any kind while visiting any place in the country .
Whenever he has to stay in any of the hotels he asks them to make sure not to give him a room with any big bed because he does n't like to sleep on beds but rather likes to sleep on the ground on a simple mattress with a blanket .
Does any of such manners and practices show any disrespect for the high post of the president ?
Refer to some of the photographs below which also confirm the above .
The Iranian president is sleeping in the guest room of his house after getting away from his special guards who follow him wherever he goes and photo is taken by his small brother according to the Wifaq Newspaper which published this photo and the next day the photo was published in most of the world 's newspapers and magazines and particularly the Americans .
During the prayer , you can see that he is not sitting in the first row and the final photo is of his dining room where the president is busy eating his meal .
HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cuba on Sunday condemned the military coup in Honduras as “ criminal , brutal ” and demanded the immediate return to office of deposed leftist President Manuel Zelaya .
The Honduran army ousted Zelaya and exiled him on Sunday in Central America ’s first military coup since the Cold War , after he upset the military by proposing an extension of his four - year term in office .
“ I denounce the criminal , brutal character of this coup , ” Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez told a news conference in Havana .
Zelaya is viewed by Cuba ’s communist leadership as a leftist ally and former Cuban leader Fidel Castro had expressed backing for his efforts to hold an unofficial public vote on Sunday to gauge support for his plan to hold a November referendum on allowing presidential re-election .
“ This coup has removed a legitimate and constitutional government simply for wanting to carry out a consultation ... in Honduras there is only one constitutional government , one constitutional president who should return immediately without conditions to the palace , ” Rodriguez said .
The Cuban foreign minister also denounced what he called the violent treatment by Honduran troops of several foreign ambassadors in Tegucigalpa , specifically those of Cuba and Venezuela .
Earlier , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Honduran soldiers took away the Cuban ambassador and left the Venezuelan ambassador on the side of a road after beating him during the coup .
The Cuban ambassador was later released .
Rodriguez said the Cuban , Venezuelan and Nicaraguan ambassadors in Tegucigalpa had been seeking to give diplomatic shelter to Zelaya ’s Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas when a band of Honduran soldiers , their faces hooded , had tried to take her away .
He said he was extremely concerned for her safety .
Chavez on Sunday put troops on alert over the coup in Honduras and said he would respond militarily if his envoy to the Central American country was kidnapped or killed .
Rodriguez said there were 84 people , including diplomats , women and children , at the Cuban embassy in Tegucigalpa and said Cuba was “ ready to defend the integrity of our embassy ” .
Any intervention by the U.S. government on behalf of the Iranian opposition is destined to backfire given the role it played in overthrowing Iran ’s last truly democratically elected prime minister and its subsequent support for the brutal dictatorial reign of the shah , a reality President Obama appears to be mercifully aware of in rejecting self - righteous calls from the likes of John McCain for him to show greater " solidarity " with the Twitter - savvy protesters .
Still , while Obama ’s generally calm and considered response to the Iranian election is appreciated , it would be nice if he could refrain from repeating unsubstantiated accusations about an active Iranian nuclear weapons program his own Director of National Intelligence says does n’t exist .
Case in point :
On CNBC this week , Obama commented on the " amazing ferment taking place in Iran " , but noted the difference between Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his challenger , former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi " in terms of their actual policies may not be as great as has been advertised . "
This much is undoubtedly true .
It ’s what follows that ’s not :
Either way , we were going to be dealing with an Iranian regime that has historically been hostile to the United States , that has caused some problems in the neighborhood and is pursuing nuclear weapons .
And so we ’ve got long - term interests in having them not weaponize nuclear power and stop funding organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas .
And that would be true whoever came out on top in this election .
Likewise , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters earlier in the week that the president " is committed to direct engagement with the Iranian government on issues of our national interest , including their pursuit of a nuclear weapon and their sponsorship of terror . "
While one is entitled to suspicions about Iran ’s ultimate intent , it remains the consensus opinion of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies that Iran does not have an active nuclear weapons program , and indeed suspended whatever program it may have had more than five years ago .
Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair , an Obama appointee , stands by that assessment , and recently told Congress that it remains the intelligence community ’s opinion that Iran ’s leadership has not made the decision to pursue nukes .
And as highlighted in a recent piece by Jeremy Hammond , editor of Foreign Policy Journal , a recent unclassified report prepared by Blair ’s office for lawmakers similarly declares : " We do not know whether Iran currently intends to develop nuclear weapons . "
A report from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ( pdf ) released in early May likewise states : " There is no sign that Iran ’s leaders have ordered up a bomb . "
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , meanwhile , which inspects Iran ’s nuclear facilities , declares in its most recent report ( pdf ) that , " As has been reported in previous reports , the Agency continues to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran . "
And outside of the credulous Washington Times , no one appears to be suggesting Iran is covertly enriching uranium to weapons - grade levels – neither the IAEA nor U.S. intelligence agencies .
All these facts seem highly relevant to claims Iran has a nuclear weapons program .
Perhaps some intrepid reporter should mention them next time a high - ranking U.S. official ignores them ?
To his credit , George Stephanopoulous , host of ABC’s This Week , during a recent interview with Admiral Michael Mullen , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , did just that , noting " the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate " — the formal opinion of the U.S. intelligence community — " concluded with a high degree of confidence that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons programs . "
Mullen , however , showed how irrelevant facts are with regard to U.S. foreign policy , offering this stunning , Rumsfeldian defense of his belief Iran is pursuing nukes : " I remain concerned that while intelligence estimates focus on what we know , I ’m concerned about what Iran might be doing that we do n’t know . "
That is , as the great philosopher - poet Donald Rumsfeld once declared , " the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence , or vice versa . "
Just as with Iraq , the onus will be on the Iranian regime to prove it is not developing weapons of mass destruction , while U.S. officials – freed from the burden of basing their statements on anything as outdated and silly as " evidence " – can continue to fearmonger about the Persian Menace while ramping up the ongoing economic warfare against Iran .
And just as Hans Blix ’s failure to find evidence of WMDs in Iraq was spun as clear evidence of Iraqi deception rather than its compliance with the UN weapons inspectors , Iran ’s submission to intrusive IAEA inspections of its declared nuclear sites is cast at best as a delaying technique if not simply ignored .
To its credit , the Obama administration has shifted the rhetoric on Iran from the Bush era , downplaying – though not taking off the table – the military option while emphasizing its desire to pursue diplomacy .
But as former National Security Council officials Flynt and Hillary Mann Everett noted in a recent New York Times op - ed , the Obama administration " has done nothing to cancel or repudiate an ostensibly covert but well - publicized program , begun in President George W. Bush ’s second term , to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to destabilize the Islamic Republic . "
In other words , the Obama administration may be engaged in a low - level war with Iran , with Secretary of State Clinton warning of " crippling sanctions " to come .
For the average Iranian , it does n’t matter if Obama seems more reasonable than Bush or appears less likely to annihilate the Middle East in some crazed messianic quest .
What matters is that his administration — in terms of actual policy , not rhetoric — has embraced the key tenets of the Bush Iran policy : overt economic warfare and covert " destablization " programs , including possible support for anti-Iranian terrorist groups .
The real test of Obama ’s commitment to resolve the impasse over Iran ’s nuclear program diplomatically will come when actual negotiations commence , where it should be quickly evident whether the pursuit of diplomacy is sincere , or whether — as Iran " special envoy " Dennis Ross suggests in his new book — it is simply a means to making economic sanctions and possible military action more palatable to the international community .
That Ross is reportedly moving up from the State Department to the White House is not reassuring .
If U.S. policymakers are truly interested in seeing Iran " unclench its fist , " they should start by ceasing to pursue policies average Americans would rightly see as acts of war if perpetrated against them .
Despite the fearmongering , there is plenty of time for sincere negotiations with the Iranian government over the nuclear issue to succeed .
Here ’s hoping the Obama administration extends its hand .
Four days before the forty - second anniversary of that other day in infamy , the release of The Untold Story of Israel ’s Deadly 1967 Assault on a U.S. Spy Ship will reopen many wounds caused by the Israeli attack on the unarmed spy ship that navigated in international waters during the Six - Day War .
Acclaimed journalist and son of a survivor , author James Scott dedicated his extensively footnoted , compelling and dramatic account to his father , who lived to tell about it and the thirty - four sailors who did not .
On June 6 , 1967 , out of a crew of 294 , thirty four were killed , 171 wounded and all scarred for life because the USA Government failed to support the troops who continue to request an open Congressional hearing to address the Israeli claim of mistaken identity .
Scott blows apart the only American investigation that was ever conducted ; the U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry 's white wash rush job that confirmed the Israeli claim which is contradicted by the facts that he uncovered .
Scott conducted hundreds of interviews with Liberty survivors , senior administration and intelligence officials and investigated recently declassified documents by Israel and America .
Scott 's fast paced tome gives voice to the frustrated outrage felt by many inside the Pentagon , State Department , NSA , Navy and even a few Congregessional representatives .
Among many issues Scott illuminates , is that Israel ’s chain of command were well aware of the Liberty ’s true identity and he eviscerates their excuse of " mistaken identity " of the uniquely American flag waving ship .
Scott reveals how the American government de-emphasized the attack because of the war in Vietnam as he illuminates the American Government 's preference in support of the Industrial Military Complex over the lives and well being of American servicemen .
Scott documents that Israeli pilots , air control staff and navy officers in Tel Aviv and Haifa were aware that before their unprovoked brutal torpedo attacks on the unarmed spy ship that the vessel was definitely American .
" More than twenty minutes before the fatal torpedo strike killed twenty - five sailors ; Israel 's chief air controller conclusively identified the Liberty as an American ship . "
[ Page 216 ]
Many years after the attack , Lieutenant Colonel Shmuel Kislev , the chief air controller at general headquarters in Tel Aviv , confessed that he knew the U.S.S. LIBERTY was an American ship as soon as an Israeli pilot radioed in its hull numbers .
Two months before the sailor 's mass burial at Arlington Cemetery , Navy analysis also uncovered that the Israeli torpedo boat gunners had targeted the spy ship with 40 - mm tracer rounds made in the United States .
In 1967 , the Republican representative from Iowa , H.R. Gross asked questions that still demand an answer today :
" Is this Government now , directly or indirectly , subsidizing Israel in the payment of full compensation for the lives that were destroyed , the suffering of the wounded , and the damage from this wanton attack ?
It can well be asked whether these Americans were the victims of bombs , machine gun bullets and torpedoes manufactured in the United States and dished out as military assistance under foreign aid . "
[ Pages 271- 272 ]
By November 1967 , lawmakers were willing to spend six million USA tax dollars to build schools in Israel but during the debate , Representative Gross spoke with the voice of conscience and introduced an amendment that " not one dollar of U.S. credit or aid of any kind [ should ] go to Israel until there is a firm settlement with regard to the attack and full reparations have been made [ and Israel ] provides full and complete reparations for the killing and wounding of more than 100 United States citizens in the wanton , unprovoked attack …
I wonder how you would feel if you were the father of one of the boys who was killed in that connection - or perhaps you do not have any feelings with respect to these young men who were killed , wounded and maimed , or their families . "
[ Page 272-273 ]
Gross 's amendment failed , justice remains delayed and American tax payers continue to support the Jewish State which has reaped a more violent and insecure planet for innocent civilians .
More :
" Since the October War in 1973 , Washington has provided Israel with a level of support dwarfing the amounts provided to any other state .
It has been the largest annual recipient of direct U.S. economic and military assistance since 1976 and the largest total recipient since World War ll .
Total direct U.S. aid to Israel amounts to well over $ 140 billion in 2003 dollars .
Israel receives about $ 3 billion in direct foreign assistance each year , which is roughly one - fifth of America 's entire foreign aid budget .
In per capita terms , the United States gives each Israeli a direct subsidy worth about $ 500 per year .
This largesse is especially striking when one realizes that Israel is now a wealthy industrial state with a per capita income roughly equal to South Korea or Spain . ” [ 1 ]
During Fiscal Year 2007 , the Congressional Research Service ’s “ U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel , ” written by Jeremy M. Sharp , Specialist in Middle Eastern Affairs , [ updated January 2 , 2008 ] reported that the US gave Israel at least $ 2,500.2 million in 2007 .
This number does not include the $ 137.894 million we spent on joint U.S. - Israeli missile defense projects or the $ 1.4 billion in loan guarantees made available to Israel in 2007 .
[ Ibid ]
While U.S. economic aid to Israel has been phased out , it has been replaced with increased military aid of $ 3.1 billion each year out of American wallets that go to provide even more weapons of destruction to one of the most powerful militaries the world has ever known .
The United States has given more money to Israel than to any other country , and the " indirect or consequential costs to the American taxpayer as a result of Washington ’s blind support for Israel exceed by many times the amount of direct U.S. aid to Israel .
Some of these ‘ indirect or consequential ’ costs would include the costs to U.S. manufacturers of the Arab boycott , the costs to U.S. companies and consumers of the Arab oil embargo and consequent soaring oil prices as a result of U.S. support for Israel in the 1973 war , and the costs of U.S. unilateral economic sanctions on Iran , Iraq , Libya and Syria . [ Ibid ]
During the Bush Administration , Israel killed more than 3,000 Palestinian civilians - including more than 1,000 children during its December - January war on the Gaza Strip - with U.S. made weapons in violation of the Arms Export Control and Foreign Assistance Acts .
In 2007 , the United States agreed to increase military aid to Israel by 25 % over the next decade , totaling $ 30 billion .
" In May 2009 , President Obama sent his FY2010 budget request to Congress which includes $ 2.775 billion in military aid for Israel , an increase of $ 225 million from this year ’s budget .
The budget request will go to the Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittees on State , Foreign Operations , and Related Programs for hearings and “ mark - ups ” .
" This request for an increase in military aid to Israel comes despite the fact that Israel consistently misuses U.S. weapons in violation of the Arms Export Control and Foreign Assistance Acts . " [ 2 ]
The Pentagon dismantled the spy ship program in 1968 while survivors and supporters continue to pursue justice .
A letter - writing campaign to Congress has been established to request a new Court of Inquiry and also that the Congressional Record on June 8th , 2009 will be the first annual " USS LIBERTY Remembrance Day . "
USS Liberty Survivor , Dick Carlson , a member of the National Cryptological Veterans Association , is asking all survivors and supporters to send a snail mail letter to their Congressional representatives [ 3 ] which I slightly edited and have mailed to :
Dear President Obama , Senator Martinez , Senator Nelson and Congresswoman Ginny Brown - Waite ,
As we approach the 42nd anniversary of the attack of the USS LIBERTY it is appropriate that all Americans pause a moment to remember the survivors of the attack on the U.S.S. LIBERTY and to observe a national moment of silence for the 34 sailors who died and the 171 wounded on June 8 , 1967 , aboard the USS LIBERTY that was patrolling in international waters of the Mediterranean when Israeli planes and torpedo boats attacked the ship .
June 8 , 1967 , will remain a day of infamy because it was the first time in history that the US NAVY was delayed from coming to the aid of an American Ship under attack .
Although , planes were launched from the USS SARATOGA , they were called back by the Secretary of Defense , Robert McNamara and President Johnson accepted the Israeli excuse as he did not want to embarrass an ally .
Israel paid minimal compensation to the families of the crew and six million for damages to the unarmed spy ship which in fact should have exceeded 40 million .
Israel has never acknowledged that the attack was premeditated and instead , blamed the victims .
In recent years , Admiral Moorer , General Raymond Davis , Rear Admiral Staring , Ambassador James Akins and others have come forth stating the attack was deliberate .
They have asked that a new Court of Inquiry be convened by the Department of the Navy , operating with Congressional oversight , to thoroughly investigate the attack on the USS LIBERTY , which is the only way justice can be rendered to the survivors .
Admiral Moorer and his distinguished colleagues have called for June 8th to be known as “ USS LIBERTY Remembrance Day , in order to commemorate the Liberty ’s heroic crew ” .
I ask for your support in opening a new Court of Inquiry , so that the survivors who have been denied justice for 42 years will have their voices recorded and Americans will know what these heroes endured .
Might this June 8th see justice begin to be served by entering into the Congressional Record : USS LIBERTY Remembrance Day .

There are rumors flying that the Jets brass are considering bringing Plaxico Burress on board .
They are waiting to see what happens with his legal situation before making a decision .
This is a BAD MOVE !!!
If the New York Jets want to stop the “ second class citizen ” stigma that surrounds the organization in New York , then they have to stop playing these kinds of games .
The Giants showed class in kicking Plaxico Burress to the curb .
He was a distraction in the locker room , was late to meetings and is now in trouble with the law .
The Steelers echoed the sentiment a few years prior .
What do the Steelers and Giants have in common ?
Well , 3 of the last 4 Lombardi Trophies , that ’s all .
The Jets need to commit to building their organization with class .
These one year fixes , i.e. Favre & Burress are just embarrassing .
Woody Johnson and Mike Tannenbaum need to take this into consideration .
The NYPD briefs both teams at the beginning of the year about what is acceptable and what is not .
Burress had no regard for himself , his teammates , and his organization .
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear he wants no preferential treatment handed to Burress in this case .
Is this really the big receiver the Jets want to bring in as they start a young QB .
Whether it be Kellen Clemens or Mark Sanchez , Burress is just not the answer .
Rex Ryan has made it clear this organization is going to run the ball and play defense .
There ’s no reason to bring in Burress for one year , regardless of his talent .
If they really think they need an big target , they should revisit Matt Jones .
Otherwise , they should stick with their current roster .
The signing of Plaxico Burress would send a terrible message to the young Jets fans out there .
What does this tell them about this organization and it ’s values ?
Regardless of the X’s and O’s , the Jets need to change their identity .
They ’ve been moving forward with good guys in the locker room and they need to keep it that way .
It looks like the 3 headed monster in the backfield can compete with any in the league , and the defense is poised for a dominant season .
Let ’s keep that the focus .
There is little doubt as to what it is in the HTC Hero that has people drooling .
Â
It ’s the HTC flavored “ Sense ” UI built on top of Android 1.5 that gets most of the “ Oooohs ” and “ Ahhhhs ” , not the form factor .
While the handset is slimmer than the G1 , it basically has the same overall design sans keyboard .
Â
It ’s pretty hard being a G1 owner and not getting jealous when you see just what a difference a little customization makes .
Â Surely there must be something for us early adopters who want to jazz up their handsets with a little Sense .
From the sounds of it , HTC just might make it available to other Android devices .
Speaking to Pocket - Lint today after the Hero announcement , HTC CEO Peter Chou was quoted saying , “ HTC sense will be available on some other existing devices . ”
Â Anyone following Android can tell you that there are only two other devices out there floating around .
Â Yeah , we know there are multiple names for each but they ’re fundmentally the same two phones all over the world .
One thing going for us G1 / myTouch 3G users is the fact the hardware in all three phones is almost the same across the board .
Â
If it runs well on the Hero , it ought to run well on the G1 .
Â
At least that ’s the theory .

the forgotten warp drive
Mathematician with an interest in general relativity , Burkhard Heim , had an idea for a war drive powered not by nuclear fusion or the decay of exotic matter , but by magnets .
You ’ve probably never heard of Burkhard Heim .
Not many people have .
After all , he was rather reclusive , all of his work was published in German and his brief moment in the spotlight was in 1957 when he proposed an odd propulsion system that could easily achieve relativistic speeds .
A spacecraft powered by this hyperdrive would get us from Earth to Mars in just a few hours and make exploring our immediate stellar neighborhood possible within our lifetimes .
Sound too good to be true ?
Well , to some extent , it is .
The theories behind how this system would work are only half complete and their primary support is complex mathematics .
Originally , Heim was trying to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity and created a universe with six dimensions in the formulas he used .
In those six dimensions , electromagnetism and gravity are linked , so if you change the strength of an electromagnetic field , you affect gravity .
So far , we ’ve observed that gravity has an influence on magnetic fields but we have n’t seen how electromagnetic fields can manipulate the gravity of an object .
But that ’s exactly what a Heim hyperdrive does .
It uses intense magnetic fields powered by equally impressive currents to produce a force equivalent to dark energy , a vital ingredient for warp drive technology .
How much energy would it take ?
To float free of Earth ’s gravity in a 150 metric ton spacecraft , you would need a superconducting coil , a sizeable rotating ring and a magnetic field that cranks out some 25 Tesla , or half a million times our magnetosphere ’s output .
We already have magnets that can generate those powerful fields and if money was no object , we ’d be able to try it out right now .
The problems begin with trying to test how fast we could go using this technology .
Heim himself never specified exactly how we ’d be able to get a relativistic velocity .
The actual mechanics of the hyperdrive come from an extension to his theories by retired patent clerk , Walter Drcher , and he ’s a little fuzzy about what will happen when we crank up the drive to full power .
One of the possible outcomes is that the speed of light for our hypothetical spacecraft would increase .
While Drcher ’s designs might not work and Heim ’s ideas might be off in some critical places , this work can give us some interesting new directions in which to push the physics of warp drives .
At worst , we can create a sample hyperdrive and see what happens .
Maybe we ’ll still be one step closer to learning how to manipulate the fabric of space and time in an unexpected way …
Deutsche Bank is Germany 's largest bank Deutsche Bank has confirmed it faces a possible criminal investigation into spying allegations .
Germany 's largest lender is accused of spying on two board members it suspected of leaking sensitive details , as well as one critical shareholder .
State prosecutors are now trying to establish whether to launch a formal criminal investigation .
The bank refused to comment on reports that it had dismissed two of its staff members in connection with the claims .
Data evidence
The bank began its own inquiry into the spying allegations in May .
ANALYSIS Tristana Moore , BBC Berlin correspondent For Germans , who have painful memories of state - sponsored surveillance , the new spying allegations touch a raw nerve .
Prosecutors have confirmed they 're now considering whether to launch a criminal investigation in Deutsche Bank .
The bank has refused to comment on the details of the allegations , which date back to 2001 , until its own inquiry is finished .
So far , it appears that the alleged surveillance involved a few isolated cases .
But all the same , the allegations are damaging .
Questions are being asked about internal controls within Deutsche , and it still remains to be seen whether the giant bank will have to face a criminal investigation .
This independent investigation is now continuing , and a Deutsche Bank spokesman said it would not be commenting on the spying allegations until it was completed .
State prosecutors are looking at evidence handed to them by the German data protection office .
It can take them two to three weeks before deciding whether to launch a formal investigation .
According to reports , Deutsche Bank has parted company with its former head of security and its head of investor relations .
Germany is no stranger to cases of corporate spying , with examples at telecoms group Deutsche Telekom , railway group Deutsche Bahn and retailer Lidl in recent years .
Last year , Deutsche Bank reported its first annual loss for more than 50 years after it was forced to write down million of euros of bad debts linked to the US mortgage market .
However , the firm returned to profitability in the first three months of 2009 , thanks primarily to record sales of corporate bonds .

TUESDAY , July 28 , 2009 ( HealthDay News ) --
A new study shows that gloomy days are linked with memory and other cognitive problems in people suffering from depression .
Previous research has shown that many people feel their moods shift with shifting skies , with more depression linked with less sunlight , but this is the first time that light exposure and cognition have been paired , stated the authors of a study appearing in the July 28 online issue of Environmental Health .
Light therapy , such as that prescribed for people with seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) , might also help people with cognitive impairments , the authors added .
" This is speculation , but those who have cognitive impairment could be helped with sunlight , " said study author Shia Kent , a doctoral candidate at the School of Public Health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham .
" This is very interesting .
I have n't seen a study exactly like this , " said Dr. Richard Isaacson , an assistant professor of neurology and medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine .
" We 're always looking for anything easy and safe in terms of stimulating the brain .
This is the beginning of something , although we definitely need more research and investigation . "
Prior studies have demonstrated a strong link between SAD and other forms of depression , and even with rates of violent murders , suicides and aggressive behavior .
Depression tends to become more pronounced in darker months , while aggressive behaviors tend to escalate in lighter months .
The effect of sunlight on cognition , however , has not been well researched .
The researchers used NASA weather data to see if there was any correlation between days of sunlight and levels of cognitive impairment in people with and without depression .
Their original hypothesis panned out : Depressed people who soaked up more of the sun 's rays over a two - week period had better cognitive function compared with their counterparts getting less sunlight .
But the relationship did not hold true in people who were n't depressed .
" We think some of the same physiological mechanisms that affect depression also affect cognitive function , " Kent said .
In particular , the authors have pinpointed the melatonin and serotonin hormonal systems as culprits .
Both of these systems are also implicated in depression .
" These same hormone systems have been implicated in a number of mental disorders and cognitive disorders , such as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and sleep disorders , " Kent said .
" I 'm an Alzheimer 's doctor , and see a lot of patients with cognitive impairment , " Isaacson said .
" When people are a little depressed , they do n't pay attention and if they do n't pay attention , they 're not going to remember things .
Increased serotonin levels increase attention , which means you remember stuff better and the mind works better .
It 's a simple concept . "
More information
The American Psychological Association has more on seasonal affective disorder .
The space shuttle Endeavour landed safely at Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) July 31 following a 16 - day mission to service and continue assembly of the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
" You are a steely - eyed hero , " radioed STS - 127 Commander Mark Polansky as fellow astronaut Alan Poindexter radioed the go for a deorbit burn from Mission Control Center - Houston .
A few tropical showers within 30 nautical miles of the shuttle landing strip at KSC briefly threatened the first landing attempt , but moved away in time for the deorbit burn at 9:41 a.m. EDT .
Polansky 's remark apparently was a reference to the repeated weather delays he and his crew endured before their July 15 liftoff .
Endeavour 's two Orbital Maneuvering System engines fired for two minutes , 51 seconds to slow the shuttle enough for it to drop out of orbit and back into the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean .
The route back to Florida took the seven astronauts onboard north from the South Pacific , over Costa Rica , Cuba and South Florida to a broad left turn into Runway 15 at KSC .
Touchdown came at 10:48 a.m .
" Congratulations on a superb mission from beginning to end , " Poindexter radioed as the wheels stopped .
" Very well done . "
" That 's what it 's all about , " Polansky said .
" We 're very happy to be home . "
The landing wrapped up one of the most complex orbital spaceflight missions to date , combining five spacewalks with a series of intricate maneuvers to install and outfit the exposed facility on Japan 's Kibo laboratory module , deliver three large station spare parts against the day when the shuttle will no longer be flying , and replace the oldest set of six batteries on the orbiting facility .
Endeavour also delivered NASA 's Tim Kopra to his long - duration post as a member of the station crew , and returned Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata to Earth after his four - month stay on the ISS .

We have talked extensively on our blog and in our white papers about the power of high frequency trading and program trading .
We have noted that these trading strategies can move the market quickly during the trading day .
We have always suspected that there have been certain major players that can dominate this space .
Now comes the case of the stolen proprietary trading code from Goldman Sachs .
Most interesting in this Bloomberg article is the following statement by Assisitant U.S , Attorney Joseph Facciponti :
“ The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways , ” Facciponti said .
Is this an admission by Goldman Sachs that there is the possibility of manipulation in the market ?
Does anyone think that this is the only program in the world that can “ manipulate ” markets ?
With all the programmers in the world , we can only imagine how many more manipulative programs are out there .
Now here is the best part according to the assistant U.S. Attorney :
The proprietary code lets the firm do “ sophisticated , high - speed and high - volume trades on various stock and commodities markets , ” prosecutors said in court papers .
The trades generate “ many millions of dollars ” each year .
Markets are a zero sum game - somebody wins and somebody loses .
Where do you think these “ many millions of dollars ” are coming from ?
[ TD : highlight mine ]
So , who is out there to protect you from these “ machines ” and their army of programmers ?
One would think the SEC has your back .
But what did they have to say about high frequency trading .
According to an article in the WSJ ( http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090618-707189.html
The Securities and Exchange Commission believes institutional money managers are “ sophisticated ” enough to trade against the machines without further regulation .
“ We do n’t want to curtail liquidity , ” said Gene Gohlke , associate director for the SEC .
Gohlke said it ’s up to the managers themselves to make sure other traders are n’t manipulating their models .
This story is just at the beginning stages and we here at Themis Trading intend to keep a careful watch on it .

At Orbitz we believe passionately in the power of travel to transform lives .
And we believe that people should have the freedom to travel wherever they choose .
Americans today have the right to travel to any country in the world except Cuba .
Three weeks ago , we launched OpenCuba.org , a campaign that gives people a way to petition U.S. leaders to end the 50 - year Cuba travel ban and give all Americans the freedom to travel to Cuba .
With Congress considering the bipartisan Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act , the opportunity to end the 50 - year ban hangs in the balance .
Join the movement to give Americans the right to travel wherever they choose when you Sign the petition .
We recognize that some of you may have different perspectives on this subject ; however , our position on this is premised on two core beliefs :
• People should have the freedom to travel where they choose
• Travel -- and the resulting exchange of ideas between people from different countries -- can be a powerful force for positive change
Thank you for considering our request to join us on this issue .
Barney Harford
CEO Orbitz Worldwide
The usual explanation is that Cuba has a unique symbolic allure .
It is the small country that confronted the U.S. empire and has survived despite the attempts by all U.S. presidents since to subdue its communist government .
It is the island with iconic leaders like Fidel Castro and Che Guevara , and the Latin American country that in the language of revolutionaries everywhere embodies the struggle of socialist humanism against the materialism of capitalist societies .
Cuba is also the small nation that in the past sent its troops to die in faraway lands in Latin America and even Africa fighting for the poor ...
And it is also the country whose progress in health care and education for the majority became the stuff of legend .
It is the small country that the United States has unsuccessfully tried to isolate for decades through a variety of means -- including an absurd and useless embargo that hurts the United States more than Cuba .
The embargo is the perfect example used by anti-Americans everywhere to expose the hypocrisy of a superpower that punishes a small island while cozying to dictators elsewhere .
If you 're an Orbitz user you probably got an e-mail from their CEO , Barney Harford , yesterday .
Something tells me Barney , a Seattle - based Obama campaign donor ( $ 2,300 ) , would n't have sent something like this out during the Bush Regime :
It 's easy enough to blame the whole tragic Cuba mess -- a tragic mess for half a century -- on pandering and truculent Republicans -- like the gangster family , the Diaz - Balarts , the patriarch having been Minister of the Interior in charge of torture under Batista .
After starting one of the first of the violent anti-Castro terror groups and carving out a gangster turf in South Florida for his family , he lived to see his two fanatic sons , Mario and Lincoln become far right Republican congressmen .
Look at those twoabove .
They 're the last of the die - hard Castro haters who would rather see everyone in Cuba rot and die than see the U.S. and Cuba normalize relations .
Yes , it would be very easy to blame it on GOP extremists -- but it would n't be accurate .
As Reese Ehrich points out in Dateline Havana : The Real Story of US Policy and the Future of Cuba , many Democrats were pandering to the same crowd of Cuban and Mafia thugs .
OK , it was under the Nixon Administration that the U.S. introduced swine flu into Cuba and under Reagan that the CIA infected 350,000 Cubans with dengue fever , Clinton , who campaigned in Florida to theof George H.W. Bush on Cuban policy , allowed the CIA to spray Matanzas Province with an Asian insect to destroy crops .
Orbitz , of course , sees the bonanza for the travel industry sitting 90 miles off the coast of Florida .
But it really does look like Obama will be the first president since Eisenhower to take Cuban policy back into American hands and out of the hands of the fascist first wave refugees who fled the Revolution .
This weektries to explain the obsession with Cuba The embargo does not hurt the United States more than Cuba .
It is bad for some American businesses -- especially in Illinois ' 18th congressional district ( but no one has explained that to their dim - witted congressman , Aaron Schock , who 's more concerned with meeting the fellas in the gym than figuring out what 's best for his constituents ) .
But for Cuba it has been absolutely devastating -- as planned , devastating , but truly crippling for the Cuban people .
It 's time stop catering to the likes of gangster spawn like the Diaz - Balarts and end this vicious , dysfunctional and inhuman policy towards the Cuban people .

According to one study , 173 million people use credit cards .
Personal debt is increasing from credit cards , but people still rely on them .
Whether your company is online or offline , selling products or providing services , accepting credit cards and applying for a merchant account is a must .
Before you decide on a merchant services provider , here are some tips to help negotiate a better deal .
If your business is considered “ high risk ” meaning you operate a company that could have multiple returns and complaints ( e.g. gaming , online adult stores ) , you might be at the provider ’s mercy for rates and terms .
If your sales volume and credit rating is good , you have room to negotiate .
If you currently already use a merchant account service and are just looking to switch companies for better rates and repayment terms , you can usually negotiate with your current company before switching .
If you need equipment for your retail store such as a credit card machine or terminal , you can negotiate these along with processing software to be included in the cost of the services .
If you do get denied from a provider because your business does n’t meet their qualifications and risk guidelines , do n’t bargain – look elsewhere .
There are literally thousands of companies that provide these services .
Merchant accounts link between your customer ’s credit card processing account and a business bank account so if you operate online , you ’ll need a “ gateway ” software that collects and encrypts credit card information .
If you operate an ecommerce site , make sure you find a company offering the software compatible with your existing website .
This can save you hundreds of IT consulting fees .
If you process credit cards at trade shows , music shows , festival concerts , or any other type of remote location , negotiate a free portable terminal or one to rent for a few months .
If you sign an agreement , review the agreement thoroughly .
Pay - transaction fees , chargebacks , “ reserve ” funds , and monthly minimums can all be in the agreement , but are hidden .
Sometimes you can negotiate the length of the service contract agreement , but if you can’t , ask about credit card processing cancellation fees .

Finding Steven Damman ?
Family Waiting for DNA Confirmation John Barnes believes he may have been stolen from Damman family 50 years ago .
June 17 , 2009  --
The Michigan man who believes he was the toddler kidnapped on Long Island , N.Y. , more than 50 years ago said today that it was pictures of the missing boy 's mother that led him to contact the boy 's family with his startling theory .
John Robert Barnes told The Associated Press today that the woman in pictures he found online looked familiar .
Now he 's " waiting for the FBI to tell me who I 'm related to . "
Steven Craig Damman disappeared from a Long Island sidewalk in 1955 .
DNA tests to confirm Barnes ' claims are still pending , but the family of missing Steven Craig Damman said it has already begun referring to Barnes as " Steven . "
" I think I 'm more hopeful than really convinced , " said William " Matt " Greer , the son of Steven Damman 's adult sister , Pamela Horne .
Barnes ' search for the people who could be his biological family began last fall when he was apparently told something by the woman who 'd raised him , Greer told ABCNews.com .
Greer said that in a phone call to Pamela Horne , Barnes said his mother was in the hospital and on medication when she blurted out the information that started his search .
Barnes looked intomissing children that matched his description .
That 's when he found the Damman family .
On Oct. 31 , 1955 , Steven Damman was nearly 3 years old when he and his baby sister , Pamela , disappeared from a sidewalk outside a Long Island store while their mother was inside .
Pamela , then about 7 months old , was found by a family friend in her carriage around the corner from the store .
Steven was never seen again .
The family eventually moved from Long Island to the Midwest .
Their parents divorced and their father , Jerry Damman , remarried .
In October , Greer said , a letter addressed to Pamela , whose last name is now Horne , was delivered to her ex-husband 's house in Liberty , Mo .
The ex-husband called Matt Greer , who lived down the street from his mother .
" I kind of threw it on the table , " Greer said and left it unopened .
Later that night , he called his mother and told her about the letter and she asked him to open it and read it to her .
Greer said he did n't realize what the sender was actually saying until about halfway through .
" I got this really eerie feeling , " he said .
" It gave me chills basically . "
' The Story Is Not Out '
Growing up , Greer said Steven 's kidnapping was n't discussed much .
" Nobody really talked about that much .
My grandmother mentioned it to me when I was 6 or 8 years old , " Greer told ABCNews.com .
" It 's been on my mom 's mind probably more than anybody else 's , " Greer said .
Reached at her Kansas City , Mo. , home , Pamela Horne said she could n't comment on her older brother 's kidnapping or her contact with the man who may be Steven .
" The story is not out no matter what the newspapers say , " Horne said .
Since the story has gained steam in the media , Horne has hired an attorney , who could not immediately be reached for comment .
Greer said that the man claiming to be Steven does have some physical similarities to both Horne and Jerry Damman .
He believes there might be other telltale physical characteristics that lend credence to Barnes ' claim , but was not sure what they were .
The phone number listed for Jerry Damman 's address in Newton , Iowa , was continually busy today , but he told The Associated Press that " it 's very possible " that Barnes was his son .
" Naturally , you 're hopeful .
Just like a death gives you closure , you know sometimes , it will give you closure to know what happened , " he said .
Nassau County ( N.Y. ) Police Lt. Kevin Smith told ABCNews.com today that they had turned over whatever information they had on the Steven Damman case to the FBI 's Detroit field office , mostly just paperwork and other documents .
" There 's really no forensic or any type of evidence like that , " Smith said .
Smith said his department first heard of Barnes in March , when he called to tell them he thought he might be Steven .
He had done a search on the Internet of kidnapped boys that matched his age and found a striking similarity in the Damman case .
Smith said Barnes called back after Horne had consented to a private DNA test that showed a " possibility " the two were siblings .
The FBI 's laboratory in Quantico , Va. , is now processing a second more definitive test , he said .
Is This the Real Steven Damman ?
Sandra Berchtold , the FBI 's Detroit field office spokeswoman , said she could not confirm or deny any information that does not exist in public records and that includes any information on the Damman case .
But , she said , the FBI does generally conduct investigations into kidnapping cases .
Smith said there 's still a lot of speculation that Barnes is Steven Damman .
While there have been few recent leads in the case , the forensic tests in 2003 officially ruled out the possibility that Steven Damman was " the boy in the box , " a small child found naked in a cardboard box in Philadelphia in 1957 .
Like all unsolved crimes , Smith said , " this case always has someone on it . "
Ernie Allen , president and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , said that parents of any missing children are often consumed by not knowing what happened .
In a case like Steven Damman 's , where decades pass without any answers , families often move on , Allen said , " but it never disappears from their thought process .
" The reality is you always think about that lost child , " he said .
" Just not knowing is what eats at you . "
Though the center was not involved in Damman 's disappearance as a cold case -- the center was founded in 1984 -- it has helped identify missing children for decades , one case going as far back as the 1940s .
" It 's unusual , " he said , of a missing child being found alive and well after so long , " but it 's not unprecedented . "
Allen said children Steven 's age are very easily manipulated and trusting of adults .
" It 's absolutely plausible that this child would have no memory of his early life , " Allen said .
The area from which Steven Damman disappeared , Smith said , has undergone a " complete change " from that day in 1955 .
The shopping area his mother was visiting that day has been torn down to make way for a new shopping plaza .
And while the town was once flush with military families , the air base that brought in so many residents is gone .
All that remains , Smith said , is some recruiter housing .
According to the Nassau County Police Department 's 1955 missing poster , Jerry Damman was a first class airman who had been stationed all over the country .
In the late 1990s , prodded by the United States , the Lebanese government vowed to eliminate the persistent problem of hashish cultivation in the lawless Bekaa Valley .
The government bought 3,000 American dairy cows to help farmers survive without relying on hashish .
But the farmers had no experience feeding and milking cows .
And the cattle needed imported , expensive feed that the farmers could not afford .
When the cows did not produce enough milk to keep the farmers afloat , they blamed the United States .
These complaints reached Iran , which stepped in with $ 50 million in farm aid for Lebanon , including cheaper cows that were easier for the Shiite Muslim farmers to feed and maintain .
The United States had bungled a seemingly simple case of foreign aid , and Iran reaped the benefits .
This “ cow vs. cow competition , ” as Neil MacFarquhar writes , demonstrates the kind of unintended consequences that have accompanied decades of United States policies in the Middle East .
Mr. MacFarquhar ’s sly , vivid memoir , “ The Media Relations Department of Hizbollah Wishes You a Happy Birthday , ” is full of such anecdotes backed up by perceptive analysis .
Whenever America tries to impose change from outside , it leads either to disaster ( Iraq ) or preservation of the status quo ( Egypt , Saudi Arabia and much of the region ) .
Mr. MacFarquhar , the United Nations bureau chief for The New York Times , spent more than 13 years as a correspondent in the Middle East , first for The Associated Press and later for The Times .
But his affection for the region is rooted in his childhood : he grew up in a Libyan oil town , where his father managed a refinery and a water desalinization plant .
Mr. MacFarquhar writes wistfully of family barbecues on a sandy Mediterranean coast in an enclave inhabited by Westerners where he learned little about the world outside .
The stories of his childhood in Libya are quite compelling , but they do not permeate the book as much as they should .
S.F. OKs toughest recycling law in U.S. Recycling S.F. supes OK mayor 's proposal - fines for violators
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close S.F. OKs toughest recycling law in U.S. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Throwing orange peels , coffee grounds and grease - stained pizza boxes in the trash will be against the law in San Francisco , and could even lead to a fine .
The Board of Supervisors voted 9 - 2 Tuesday to approve Mayor Gavin Newsom 's proposal for the most comprehensive mandatory composting and recycling law in the country .
It 's an aggressive push to cut greenhouse gas emissions and have the city sending nothing to landfills or incinerators by 2020 .
" San Francisco has the best recycling and composting programs in the nation , " Newsom said , praising the board 's vote on a plan that some residents had decried as heavy - handed and impractical .
" We can build on our success . "
The ordinance is expected to take effect this fall .
The legislation calls for every residence and business in the city to have three separate color - coded bins for waste : blue for recycling , green for compost and black for trash .
Failing to properly sort your refuse could result in a fine after several warnings , but Newsom and other officials say fines will only be levied in the most egregious cases .
Fines for almost all residential customers and many small businesses - anyone who generates less than a cubic yard of refuse a week - are initially capped at $ 100 .
Businesses that do n't have proper bins face escalating fines up to $ 500 .
There is a moratorium on fines until at least July 2011 for tenants and owners of multifamily buildings or multitenant commercial properties to get people used to composting .
Buildings where recycling carts wo n't fit can get a waiver .
" In any scenario there will be repeated notices and phone calls before we even start talking about fines , " said Jared Blumenfeld , head of the city 's Department of the Environment .
" We do n't want to fine people . "
The proposal , hailed as an effective way to cut about two - thirds of the 618,000 tons of waste the city sent to landfill in 2007 , drew resistance from some apartment building owners when details emerged about a year ago .
And some residents were upset over the possibility of inspectors checking their garbage .
The ordinance calls for garbage collectors to leave tags on containers when they spot incorrectly sorted material , but those collectors are only going to view what 's on top of the container and have no intention of going through them , said Robert Reed , a spokesman for San Francisco collectors Sunset Scavenger Co. and Golden Gate Disposal & Recycling Co. , subsidiaries of Recology , formerly Norcal Waste Systems .
" Our role is to pick up the garbage and to make recycling as easy and convenient as possible for our customers , " Reed said .
" Our collection drivers will not become enforcers . "
City officials would levy any fines , and the legislation does n't provide funding for new trash inspectors .
" It does n't create trash police , " Blumenfeld said .
Support mixed
Newsom 's proposal created odd political bedfellows at the Board of Supervisors .
It was co-sponsored by frequent Newsom critics , Supervisors Chris Daly and Ross Mirkarimi , while two of the mayor 's most reliable allies , Supervisors Carmen Chu and Sean Elsbernd , were the only opponents .
" This is a little too much big brother , even for me , " Elsbernd said .
" We 've got a huge problem in my district and a lot of other parts of the city with people who go in and out of garbage cans at night scavenging .
Who 's going to be responsible for that ?
Are we creating a whole brand - new problem ? "
Elsbernd also questioned assurances that fines would not be aggressively pursued against residents , saying similar promises were broken on legislation against leaving trash cans visible .
The San Francisco Apartment Association , a trade group for rental property owners , took a neutral stance on the plan after language was dropped that would have held landlords responsible for tenants ' sorting .
Cities from Pittsburgh to San Diego have mandatory recycling .
None , however , requires all food waste to be composted .
Seattle passed a law in 2003 requiring people to have a compost bin but , unlike San Francisco , it did not mandate that all food waste go in there .
Reducing trash
Newsom floated the mandatory recycling idea in April 2008 as he faced the city 's self - imposed goals of having a 75 percent recycling rate in 2010 , with zero waste by 2020 .
The rationale behind the move is clear .
Material like food scraps and plant clippings that go into landfills take up costly space and decompose to form methane , a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide .
A June 2008 report by the Institute for Local Self - Reliance , a group focused on environmentally sound community development , said a zero waste approach is one of the fastest , cheapest and most effective ways to protect the climate .
Cutting waste sent to landfills and incinerators would be like closing 21 percent of U.S. coal - fired power plants , the report said .
About 36 percent of what San Francisco sends to landfill is compostable , and another 31 percent is recyclable , a comprehensive study found .
By the city 's count , it currently diverts 72 percent of its waste , best in the nation .
If recyclables and compostables going into landfills were diverted , the city 's recycling rate would jump to 90 percent , Blumenfeld said .
Only 22 percent of the city 's 10,000 large apartment buildings have composting bins , but the number has tripled in the last year , Reed said .
" Once people start to compost , " he said , " they find it easy to do . "
One hang - up , of course , is the perceived yuck factor .
" It 's a false phobia that things are going to smell , " Reed said .
" It 's the same garbage you already had , it 's just handling it differently , in a more environmentally responsible way . "

When the apocalypse reduces the world 's structures to rubble , we may have to take our architectural cues from the micronation of Ladonia , a politically independent art installation depicting a city made of driftwood and nails .
Sadly , no - one actually lives in these structures , or in Ladonia for that matter .
Artist Lars Vilk constructed the buildings as a sculpture titled " Nimis " and a stone fortress titled " Arx " inside the Kullaberg nature reserve in Skåne , Sweden .
But the Swedish government determined that the structures were houses , which were illegal to construct in the reserve , and demanded they be removed .
Vilks declared the region — " Ladonia " — a micronation in protest .

Since then , Ladonia has been the subject of much attention , both serious and lighthearted .
In 2002 , 4,000 Pakistani refugees mistook Ladonia for an inhabitable country and applied for asylum , but none were given residence inside the driftwood buildings .
In 2006 , the Pirate Bay - funded Armed Coalition Forces of the Internets declared mock - war on Ladonia , demanding that its government repeal copyright laws and recognize the rights of intellectual property pirates .
For a mere $ 12 , you can become a citizen of Ladonia , joining its current membership of over 14,000 individuals .
Presumably , membership grants you the right to move into Ladonia in the event of an apocalypse , or at least blueprints for building your own version of Nimis .

Last month , Barack Obama 's administration announced that it would bolster efforts to support Somalia 's embattled government by providing money for weapons and helping the military in neighbouring Djibouti train Somali forces .
An administration review of US policy toward Somalia found an urgent need to supply the Somali government with ammunition and weapons as it struggles to confront increasingly powerful Islamic militants .
The Indian education sector is in distress .
How does one explain the lack of outrage among the population at something which affects them so forcefully ?
Could it be because they are not aware of how dysfunctional the system is ?
That must at least partly explain the apathy .
Perhaps they know but accept it with the fatalistic resignation of the type that accepts corruption among public officials ?
Perhaps they mistakenly consider pervasive corruption as normal .
But how can they not see that government control of education , the rampant corruption , and the crippled education system are all of a piece ?
Here ’s a news item which reports that medical post graduate studies involve bribes of up to Rs 2 crores ( around $ 400,000 . )
The TOI report on MBBS seats sold for between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 40 lakh by two private colleges in Chennai barely exposes the tip of the iceberg .
The scam gets bigger , more brazen as medical graduates embark on specializations that are necessary for a successful career .
The price this year for a post - graduate seat in radiology in most leading private colleges across the country is Rs 2 crore while in cardiology , gynaecology and orthopaedics are priced around Rs 1.5 crore .
It should be obvious why this sort of thing can happen .
It is not quantum mechanics .
It is a predictable consequence of what I call “ engineered scarcity . ”
Briefly the problem can be stated as
To address not just this question but a whole family of related questions , I propose a general theory of “ Power , Scarcity , and Corruption . ”
Basically , the three form a nexus , with mutually reinforcing influences .
Scarcity in general is not a chronic condition in any functioning economy ; it has to be engineered .
Given economic freedom , people work their way out of any transient scarcity .
For persistent scarcity to exist , it has to be carefully nurtured .
The motivation for engineering scarcity is that it allows the consolidation of power .
This is Econ101 and even a superficial reading of the chapter on monopolies is sufficient to persuade one that monopolies do restrict quantities to maximize “ profits . ”
The relationship between power and scarcity is bi-directional .
You have to have power to engineer scarcity , and through that engineered scarcity you gain power .
Political power allows you to dictate policies that give you monopoly control and then you use that for gaining even more political power .
Then of course , where there is scarcity , corruption cannot be far behind .
Corruption is therefore a mechanism which allows the collection of rents that arise from the scarcity .
If scarcity were to vanish for some reason , both the corruption and the power to extract rents would disappear .
For those in power , therefore , the primary objective is to somehow maintain an artificial scarcity both for maintaining power and for gaining from the corruption .
Now back to our educational system .
The government has a monopoly control of the sector through many institutions such as the Ministry of Human Resources and Development , the University Grants Commission , etc.
Licenses and other requirements force the private sector from fully and freely participating in providing education .
The resulting scarcity gives the government a handy lever for manipulating voting blocks .
Quotas and reservations are handed out to favored groups .
And more directly , the bureaucrats and politicians extract rents from handing out the licenses and permits to those who have the deepest pockets .
[ “ Power , Scarcity , and Corruption . ” Sept 2007 . ]
How does the arithmetic of corruption in education work ?
I gave an illustrative hypothetical example in May 2007 :
Some institution wants to start a medical college somewhere in India .
It applies for a license and is told off the record that the price is Rs 20 lakhs ( approximately US $ 50,000 ) per seat .
For the 200 - seat license applied for the price is Rs 4,000 lakhs , to be delivered in unmarked bills in a large plain brown envelope .
That “ fee ” is routed through the licensing bureaucracy with appropriate payoffs to different people — the lion ’s share ending up in the appropriate political hands .
After all , securing top positions at the bureaucracy is not cheap ; and running elections is a costly business .
The firm having paid the whopping fee to operate a medical college , now has to recover its costs .
Perhaps its actual cost of training a medical student is Rs 5 lakhs per year .
It adds on a “ special college entry fee ” of say Rs 10 lakhs ( remember to bring in unmarked bills in a plain brown envelope ) to the normal tuition fees .
The hapless students are forced to pay because seats are limited .
The four year medical training which should have cost only Rs 20 lakhs if free entry were allowed into the field now has to pay Rs 30 lakhs , and perhaps gets substandard training .
Further down the line , doctors are in short supply and therefore they command some market power and thus are able to recover their costs .
The patients suffer but that is why they are patients — they suffer .
Engineering shortages is what the government does very effectively .
Engineer scarcity in sufficient number of sectors , and you have engineered a very poor economy .
India ’s poverty is engineered by the government .
There ’s really no earthly ( or even heavenly reason ) for India to be a “ third world ” country .
The decades of governance by the Congress has effectively destroyed India ’s potential .
The government has done the most damage to India through its stranglehold on education .
By destroying the education system , it has destroyed the capacity among the people to perceive the problem in the first place .
It is like the human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS : HIV acts by attacking the immune system itself .
Similarly , hitting the education system destroys the capacity among the people to ever understand what ails the education system and why .
Here ’s an example of the lack of understanding of what ’s wrong .
The news item linked above ends with this :
Another senior expert , who has held prestigious posts at the national level , says he has urged the UGC to hold centralized examinations like JEE for admissions to both MBBS and PG courses .
“ It ’s a national shame to commercialize education .
Besides , death of merit affects the quality of medical education .
When money is paid , these colleges ensure that the exit is definite .
The students pass , qualified or not , ” he said .
I have added the emphasis in the above quote .
The “ senior expert ” does not even realize that it higher education and “ commercialization ” go together .
That commercialization can be legal and in the open ( as it is , say , in the US ) or it can be part of the underground corrupt system .
The latter is an inefficient system that arises out of the government monopoly control of the system .
Of course , governments do n’t do things without a reason .
The reason in this case is that it allows the government to extract rents through bribes .
The people in government gain at the expense of the economy .

Inside / Outside Days Out in London :
Where to take the kids when it looks like rain and Shine : by Laura Evans Vogel , founder www.london-baby.com and contributor to www.reallykidfriendly.com
Getting out with the kids and enjoying all that London has to offer on a fine summer ’s day can be a rewarding day for adults and children alike .
There are animals in the city farms , wildlife ponds , lush trees , shrubs and manicured gardens .
On the other hand , being far from home on a fine day suddenly turned cold and wet day can miserable , especially with very small children .
Fear not !
In London you can easily plan a weather - proof day summer day .
Head to the farm , the ecology centre , the park and if the weather turns foul , head indoors and spend time soaking up some culture at one of the near - by museums .
Kensington Gardens and The Natural History Museum
Kensington Gardens in the midst summer is heaven .
Let the kids run and tumble in the growing heath or dally in the dizzying delight of drifting dandelion seeds , look for exotic fowl on the Serpentine , check out the Peter Pan Statue or head over to the Princess Diana Memorial Playground with its swings , sand and massive pirate ship .
If you need to warm up , head over to the Natural History Museum and continue investigating wildlife in the Cocoon at the Darwin Centre , the Wildlife Garden or the Investigate room .
The Darwin Centre is a new addition to the museum that houses millions of specimens collected from around the world .
Take the kids for an educational walk down the Cocoon where they can look at preserved Scarab Beetles , Luna Moths , and Tarantulas .
Evan small children can enjoy looking the exotic collections while having a little run down the ramps .
There is a great interactive area where you pack for a field outing .
It is brilliantly put together .
After the Cocoon , if the weather cooperates , take the kids into the Wildlife Garden and have a wander around the nature path .
Look for moorhens in the wildlife pond , along with wrens and robins in the marsh areas , but do not miss the bee tree .
There is a bee hive that is set inside a tree with a window to see the bees at work in their hive , absolutely amazing .
For children ages 3 + , the investigate room is the perfect place to learn a love for science .
There are specimen trays filled with shells , animal skins , bones , preserved bugs , pine cones , tortoise shells .
Further , there are microscopes and measuring instruments to really investigate the specimens .
An attentive staff will guide older children through an investigation while the adult chases the toddler around .
The Investigate room is open from 2:30 term time as schools have usually booked the room prior to that , and is open from 11:00 during school holidays .
Coram ’s Fields and the Foundling and British Museums :
Right in the heart of London is a massive playground where adults are only allowed to enter with children so kids are able to really run far and free .
Coram ’s
Fields boast penned sheep , hen , ducks and goats for children to look at .
After taking in the wonders of animals , have a play in the sandbox , or in one of the four climbing frames .
There is a high - quality Austrian bakery and sandwich stand in the playground that does amazing coffee .
Should you need to head inside , the Foundling Museum is just around the corner ; entry free is £ 7.50 per adult .
While you will learn a lot about the first orphanage and art museum in London , and on weekends they have good activities for older children , the museum is not really pitched for toddlers .
A good alternative for young children is the near - by British Museum .
There is no entry fee , and you can seek shelter wandering around the Greek temples and Egyptian tombs .
On weekends and school holidays they have amazing activities for the older children , but they do offer fun activities for the under five ’s , too .
Check the web site for details .
Vauxhall City Farm and Tate Britain
Slightly off the beaten path , a short walk from Vauxhall Station is a hidden gem , the Vauxhall City Farm .
This free city farm is open Wednesdays through Sundays 10:30 – 4:00 and his home to over 80 animals .
Unique to many city farms , there is a pen filled with rabbits and chickens ; children are allowed to play and handle the animals in here .
This can be a very messy , but it really is such a pure right of childhood to be able to chase a chicken or a rabbit around a barn yard and then hold them ( usually accomplished with a great deal of adult assistance ) .
Further , the farm has alpacas , turkey , cows , goats and horses .
There is a small vegetable garden to play in , too .
Should you need to get out of the rain , just over the river ( 15 minute walk with a pushchair , toddler pace much longer ) is Tate Britain with its sentimental Pre-Raphaelites .
Again , there is little at the museum actually pitched to toddlers , but the galleries are large and there is plenty to see .
On the weekends and during school holidays there is an art cart available .
The café has , among other things , child portions of fruit and veggies , great cakes and coffees .
Ranelagh Gardens and the National Army Museum
Just off the Embankment is the Chelsea Hospital grounds , an amazing expanse of gardens that are open to the public .
The Ranelagh Gardens are completely fenced in and are comprised of hills , brambles , trails and a tiny shelter in case of sudden rain .
There are no climbing frames , and the toilets are a bit of a walk , but it is such a special area to take small children to have an old fashioned romp running up and down hills , playing hide and seek in the woods or just plain old woodland exploration .
Next to the Chelsea Hospital Ground is the National Army Museum ( new Kid Zone to open 18th July ) .
Should you need a break from the weather , head this way and enjoy the galleries and exhibits .
If you are lucky , the Kid Zone may be open .
They have timed entries from 10:00 and 11:30 am , 12:30 , 1:30 , 2:30 , 3:30 and 4:30 ; on weekends this schedule changes with pre-booked parties .
This is the best indoor climbing frame play area in London .
Not only is the entry free , the space is immaculately kept with family toilets .
In the event that you have missed the entry , continue through the museum .
The museum is fascinating and there are very toddler - friendly interactive play areas .
Yesterday , we ran an article relating how the party 's enemies are queueing up to sabotage us .
This effort always intensifies in the run up to elections .
One of the points covered in the article related to an attack upon the party over one of our candidates .
This article was written in some haste and failed to make a very important point .
Below , the article is offered again in its final form
 BNP bigots  and BNP Muslim candidate fantasies run riot
Left - wing journalists  terrified by the possibility of the BNP winning more seats in the May elections  are stepping up their attacks on the party .
Typically , the charge is being led by the Guardian , the Mirror and the Liverpool Echo .
And , equally typical , it is a two - pronged assault .
First there is the material which is designed to shock and frighten Mr. and Mrs. Average Middle England .
The fact that we are standing a candidate in the Liverpool ward next to the ward in which black teenager Anthony Walker was murdered last year is being presented as an example of some kind of racist bigotry .
A strange conclusion , given that the BNP has condemned the murder every time we have commented on the fact that white victims of racist murder are overwhelmingly ignored by the mass media .
Double standards
Neither the Guardian , the Mirror , nor any other national newspaper , for example , have reported the brutal racist murder of young white dad David Henkel in Chatham , Kent , by asylum seekers in the very same week as Anthony Walker was slain ( except the Sun , which mentioned the killing in a single line in an article about lawless Britain without giving any details ) .
David was savagely kicked to death by a gang of asylum seekers .
The Afghani ring - leader has since been jailed for manslaughter , despite having boasted to prisoners and warders at the prison from which he had been released just one month earlier that he intended to kill a white man after his release .
Has the Guardian approached the Labour , Lib - Dem or Tory parties to ask why they  parties which believe the UK should accept bogus asylum seekers who have come halfway round the world to get to Soft Touch Britain  are standing in the wards adjacent to the ward in which David Henkel was murdered ?
Of course not , because the Anthony Walker / BNP candidate story is not a real news story at all , but a piece of crude propaganda aimed at interfering in the democratic process by costing the BNP votes over a non-issue .
 Muslim smear
The Guardian is also all of a flutter with a story designed to hit the BNP internally .
One of their hacks has been in touch today pretending to be amazed and almost sympathetic over the fact that our candidate in a ward in Bradford , Sharif Gawad , is a Pakistani Muslim . 
Oh no he isnt !
The British National Party is an ethno- nationalist party .
We are very pleased to work closely with members of other ethnic groups who share our desire to preserve our separate racial and cultural identities .
But separate identities are not preserved by building integrationist institutions , including political parties .
To do so would turn us into another cog in the global liberal capitalist identity - destroying machine , part of the old problem , not part of the new solution .
For that reason ( and because maintaining our stance as the defenders of an ethnically - defined British family of nations gives our members protection from unfair dismissal at work under Racial Discrimination Laws ) we do not have , and will not have , any non-white or Muslim members .
Mr Gawads grandfather was an Armenian Christian who fled to Britain as a genuine refugee from Muslim persecution .
When he was christened , his mother named him after the then heart - throb filmstar Omar Sharif .
He is a staunch Bradford BNP activist , renowned for his strong anti-Islamic stance and for his dedicated hard work for the Cause .
Among other things he was present at all the Leeds Crown Court free speech demonstrations , whatever the weather , because thats the sort of chap he is .
In reporting this , the Guardians agenda is not to convince its limp - wristed liberal readership that the BNP is now the acceptable face of British nationalism .
The aim is rather to give ammunition to far - left moles , state agents provocateur and the simply stupid  particularly those who infest various hardline right - wing Internet forums  to try to worry and disillusion BNP activists who are proud to belong to the only serious party in Britain that refuses to be Politically Correct or to pretend that race doesnt exist .
To be sure , while Sharif is an excellent activist and while his colleagues in Bradford BNP will all attest to his activism and dedication his name alone does give rise to confusion .
For this reason alone it would have been better , in hindsight , for him not to have been put forward as a BNP candidate .
It has to be said , however , that it precisely because locally in Bradford and West Yorkshire and where Sharif is well known , there is no such feeling and consequently no thought was given as to how it would be seen in the rest of the country .
While it is understandable for confustion to have been occasioned by Sharifs candidature , ordinary members can rest assured that Sharif Gawad is not a racial alien .
Sharif , despite his name is white and British and the British National Party is staying true to its core principles .
Internet gossip on anti-BNP websites may have it that Sharif is really a Pakistani who takes time off campaigning five times a day to pray to Allah , but in reality these people are delighted to think they have found a stick with which to beat the BNP as having sold out .
The truth is that the party is standing a totally assimilated , quarter Armenian of Christian origin who was named after a film star in one of our less promising wards in Bradford .
It is important to distinguish Ordinary members who have been left confused by this candidature and who cannot be blamed , from the troublemakers and nazi cranks who know that it means no such thing , but who think they can further their own agendas .
The BNP is the last hope for our Race and Nation  some people will do all they can to sabotage it .
Fortunately , despite the best ( i.e. worst ) efforts of the Guardian , no - one who is serious about winning the power we need to reverse the deadly flood - tide of mass immigration will take any notice of such nonsense .
Damages
Similarly , the wise will ignore the online rumour - mongers busy telling everyone who will listen that the case of mistaken identity in Docs Diary over the Indian doctors ( for which we apologised here last week ) has cost the party £ 60,000 in damages .
It has not , as the problem has been settled with an amicable out - of - court settlement less than 10 % of this figure  legal restrictions prevent us from disclosing the exact figure .
Not good for our Treasury point of view , but our Internet reach and press office  to which Dr. Edwards contributes an outstanding amount  brings us in incalculable amounts of free publicity , influence , donations and new memberships .
The lesson will be learned , for we dont have money to throw away , but we refuse to hang good and talented servants of our Cause on account of a one - off mistake .
 The Doc does tremendous work for this party , particularly with the press and on the radio , where his commonsense and dry humour have gone a long way to making him  Doctor BNP  to millions of listeners on local and national stations .
He has the full support of the partys entire leadership , so take no notice of anyone who says otherwise , and rest assured that the out - of - court settlement ( with the money going to a very worthy anti-drug addiction charity ) is most certainly not going to bankrupt the BNP . 
What all our readers should take note of , however , is the way in which our opponents  attempts to derail the BNPs progress are looking increasingly desperate .
We are not selling out , and were not going bust .
We re Britains only serious , solvent and truly principled ethno- nationalist political party .
We hope youll do something to help us stay that way , for Britain has no other hope .
A Tokyo company has begun selling beer mugs made of ice .
The mugs , which are said to last about an hour in the summer heat , may be purchased over the Internet for approximately $ 6 each ( 580 yen ) .
Presumably one would have to pay for refrigerated delivery , but thanks to a culture of customary gift giving that often involves food , frozen deliveries are surprisingly affordable .

When I first started playing pool ( billiards ) , I considered myself an average player .
I could never be sure if I would make the next shot , and running two or three balls in a row was a big achievement for me .
I read books on aiming systems like the ghost ball system , and tried different practice drills to improve my game .
However I still saw a clear difference between “ easy ” and “ difficult ” shots and trying advanced things like position play would make me miss my shot .
This is the story of my journey .
How I discovered the art of “ Aiming without Aiming ” .
If you have played pool for a while , chances are you will identify with this or at least recognize what I describe .
If you have played only some pool , I suggest you read with an open mind – understanding this might change your game .
If you do n’t play pool yet , but would like to start , then you can learn how to play pool well in under 30 minutes .
If you already understand the basics , but would like to develop the ability to run the table , you should look at my article series on the basics of cue ball position control .

Some time back I heard the term “ subconscious - competence ” and about the subconscious mind .
This is the same thing that allows us to walk without having to logically plan every muscle that needs to be raised to take each step –
We just look at where we want to go , decide we want to go there , and then automatically end up there .
It is also responsible for the times when we might get distracted while driving , thinking about all kinds of other stuff , and suddenly realize that we have reached home without remembering any of the turns , traffic lights or other cars on the road .
I do n’t think that we were ever really meant to be conscious learners .
The conscious mind can handle about 5 - 9 things at a time after which it zones out .
The subconscious mind can apparently keep track of EVERYTHING , including things the conscious mind would n’t even dare try .
The only thing the unconscious mind really needs is
1 . The initial desire or thought from the conscious mind – Creating the goal
2. Trusting signals from the subconscious mind – following your instincts
3 . Allowing the subconscious mind to learn and train itself for the goal – Allowing mistakes to happen without labeling or judging them and not getting frustrated by them
4 . Getting out of your own way – Letting the subconscious mind do everything instead of trying to take over the wheel while it is doing its work .
Three months ago , I wrote down in my notebook , a thought addressed to my subconscious mind – “ I refuse to aim .
You do it otherwise we both miss ” .
For three whole months , I did not aim .
I just looked at the pocket I wanted the ball to go , and just shot the cue ball without aiming with any system …
Talk about a crazy , unrealistic , leap of faith …
A few days after I began , when the first difficult shot went in without aiming , I was pleasantly surprised .
I assumed it was just luck .
Over the next few days as more and more people started noticing my consistent shooting “ luck ” .
This was actually working .
During this time , I still had to keep reminding myself to not try to aim .
However as I started making tougher and tougher shots effortlessly , I started getting an ego .
I started getting addicted to the idea of always making the shot .
When I did miss , I forgot rule 3 and used to get angry at myself .
I did n’t realize that when I missed , it was n’t that my plan was n’t working , it was just that my subconscious mind had n’t trained itself for that particular shot yet .
It took several days just to accept any misses and not try to control with my conscious mind .
With time , however , I learned to let go of outcome dependence while shooting and just play one shot at a time .
Now days every shot is “ easy ” .
I spend exactly 0 seconds planning the shot .
I just look at the pocket , look at the ball , wait for that “ YES ” signal in my head , and shoot .
It goes in on its own .
I do n’t aim or shoot .
My subconscious mind does .
I do n’t take credit for the shots since it was n’t me who really shot them .
I saw my subconscious mind shooting some amazing shots which blew my mind .
It was almost like my subconscious mind was a different person , who was shooting through me .
And as it overtook me with its skills , it earned my trust and respect .
I no longer dared to compete with it or try to take over the steering wheel again .
I knew , that as long as I stayed out of it ’s way , it would do the job better than I could have ever hoped to .
But this was n’t the real shock .
Now that I could shoot without aiming , I wanted to see how far I could take this idea of trusting my subconscious mind , and what limits my mind had .
My next goal was to run a table ( run all 7 balls , and the 8 ball in one go without giving my opponent a turn ) .
Again , I would n’t plan it or think about it , just make a goal and trust my subconscious to do whatever was needed .
Over the next few days , I found myself wanting to shoot one particular ball versus another , without any logical reason .
I would just look at the table , see a particular ball and think to myself - “ I like that one , that is what I will shoot next ” .
Trying to logically decide which was the best ball to shoot actually messed things up .
One week later , I broke and ran the entire table when playing with my team captain – or rather my subconscious mind did .
Now days , running 4 - 5 balls is almost a regular occurrence .
Three months ago , I would have laughed at that possibility .
The funny thing is , I do n’t even have to be paying attention to the table while I am shooting .
I can be thinking about taxes or some movie I watched .
In fact , anything OTHER than trying to aim the shot .
The balls just go in on their own .
I seem to get so zoned out , I lose track of time and place .
I can now play entire pool games and not remember shooting even a single shot .
Sometimes I do n’t even remember the face of the person I was shooting with .
It ’s almost like I am a spectator in a dream like state watching someone else playing .
I think some people call it being in the zone .
Some people call it instinct .
Some people call it muscle memory .
Some call it trusting a higher power .
Whatever you choose to call it , trusting your subconscious mind can let you live life the way it was always meant to be – effortless .

PS : Based on a lot of feedback that I received , I wrote a follow up article – Aiming without Aiming Part II – How I really aim a billiards shot .
For people who think that “ this aiming thing ca n’t work ” or would like more details on aiming technique , the extra explanation might help .
PPS : Almost a year after I started my experiments with aiming without aiming and the subconscious mind , I discovered the book The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Gallwey .
This book talks about the same concepts of subconscious learning applied to the game of tennis and is without doubt one of the best descriptions of how to achieve subconscious competence .
I found myself agreeing with almost everything the author said , and was amazed by the new ideas that I would have probably taken a long time to discover on my own .
I guess there had to be a reason this book is already consider a bible for inner game and has sold millions of copies worldwide .
If you found this article interesting and would like a more detailed explanation of the principles , I would strongly recommend taking a look at this book .
You will find that the concepts can be applied to any game or sport that you wish to .
Of course , aiming without aiming is n’t a magic pill solution to billiards mastery .
This is just one teeny piece of the puzzle .
Obviously ‘ Aiming without Aiming ’ or subconscious competence only comes after developing conscious competence – Learning good pool fundamentals , following a simple aiming system , practicing with drills to build muscle memory .
Even after that , aiming is just a part of the puzzle .
You also need to learn to control cue ball position .
The next big piece is working on the inner game of pool , learning to bounce back from bad nights and using your emotions to win under pressure .
Since I improved my aiming , I find myself spending almost as much time on “ inner game ” as on “ outer game ” .
I am still trying to figure it all out .
But every time I discover another piece of the puzzle , I try to share it .
In the the upcoming film Big Fan , comedian Patton Oswalt makes his dramatic - lead star - turn as an obsessive sports fan whose chance encounter with his hero unexpectedly ends in violence .
Does that sound bad ?
The trailer looks surprisingly good !
Wow !
Remember when Robert DeNiro made this movie ?
Twice ?
Nevertheless , I 'm feeling this Travis Bickle 2k9 thing !
Let 's hope that Big Fan avoids the mistake Observe and Report made : cannibalizing its leading man .
Patton looks like he has more emotional range than Seth Rogen , so this could be a knockout .
P.S. Has Patton Oswalt ever looked MORE like a butchy - sad lesbian than he does here ?

So : remember that terrible , shocking video of the awful frat - tards spewing racial epithets , screaming and trashing President Barack Obama in ways so debase , they 're really not even worth quoting here ?
Well , The Huffington Post actually censored it .
Why ?
Max Blumenthal , the filmmaker who took the video , contributed to The Huffington Post previous to this , so it 's not a one - off thing , nor a user - submitted video ( like the Euna Ling issue at Current TV ) .
He 's a contributor .
And he notes of his experience :
Within a few hours , I received an email from a Huffington Post administrator informing me he had scrubbed my video from the site .
" I do n't see that it has any real news value , " the administrator told me .
" For me it only proves that one can find drunk people willing to say just about anything .
Especially drunk , moronic people . "
For the first time , the premier clearinghouse for online news and opinions had suppressed one of my posts .
... Bringing new meaning to the word " clearinghouse , " certainly .
Any request for comment has had us referred to Blumenthal 's post on Phillip Weiss 's blog regarding the fiasco , something it now officially is .
Much of the outrage over the video - which we 've re-posted below - falls in line with what The Huffington Post issued : that the guys in the video are drunk , that the video could be a crafted political set - up used to further an agenda , that the entire thing is too outrage - provoking to consider as anything but outright propaganda .
That 's ridiculous , especially for The Huffington Post , though .
Even though they 're mostly just used to aggregating the news of others ( or as 30 Rock so nicely put it : telling us what we already know ) , they 're a news site , and this is news , and it 's their job to - at the very least - provide some kind of context for this kind of thing .
The video 's clearly not fake or staged in any regard : why would these very clear faces expose themselves to the world like that ?
It 's the worst kind of " viral " there is .
And yes , they 're drunk , but as we all well know by now , being drunk does n't necessarily invalidate the kinds of things you say when you 're trashed .
Sometimes , in fact : the opposite .
If anything , The Huffington Post 's deletion of the video looks like a political maneuver on their part .
Maybe they just do n't want to be a part of something so hot - button as this , or do n't want to chance it on any of the risk that this story may or may not hold .
Or it could be agenda - based .
It 's probably none of those things .
It 's probably the equivalent of some tight - assed S & P person over there who thinks they 're taking the initiative with their job .
What we want to know :
Who is this person censoring things over at the Huffington Post ?
And what would Ariana think ?

Causes of stress
Stress is usually a reaction to mental or emotional pressure .
It 's often related to feeling like you 're losing control over something , but sometimes there 's no obvious cause .
When you 're feeling anxious or scared , your body releases stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol .
This can be helpful for some people and stress might help you get things done or feel more motivated .
But it might also cause physical symptoms such as a faster heartbeat or sweating .
If you 're stressed all the time it can become a problem .
Identifying the cause
If you know what 's causing your stress it might be easier to find ways to manage it .
Some examples of things that may cause stress include :
work – feeling pressure at work , unemployment or retirement
family – relationship difficulties , divorce or caring for someone
financial problems – unexpected bills or borrowing money
health – illness , injury or losing someone ( bereavement )
Even significant life events such as buying a house , having a baby or planning a wedding could lead to feelings of stress .
You might find it hard to explain to people why you feel this way , but talking to someone could help you find a solution .

Evolution of the Unhealthy American , Part 2 : Our deteriorating diet , high fructose corn syrup , obesity
Furci Home / Fitness Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
You hear some experts claiming it 's because we eat too much and exercise too little .
Some claim they have found a fat gene .
And a few others are even claiming obesity may be contagious .
Overall , there are a variety of factors that play a role in people becoming overweight , obese and unhealthy .
This is what makes getting lean ( er ) and healthier , such a complex issue to fix .
Or is it ?
Now , I think it 's indisputably obvious , that if you are a chronic overeater and sit on your duff all day , weight gain , obesity and dire health will be your fate .
Over -consumption of food , especially the wrong food , coupled with inactivity will definitely increase your chances of being overweight and acquiring the inherent health risks .
And , there are those who are genetically predisposed to gaining weight easier than others .
However , studies show very few obese people have been found to posses mutated genes .
Also , according to some scientists , isolating a fat virus has promise in helping to solve the obesity epidemic .
However , not all scientists agree that a virus , related to the common cold , has anything to do with the extraordinary rate at which Americans have gained weight .
To put it quite simply , very few people have a weight problem directly attributed to a virus .
Chronic overeating and inactivity are definitely on the pathway to an obese , unhealthy life .
But are we as a nation really eating that much more ?
According to surveys conducted in 1977 to 1978 and 1994 to 1996 , reported daily caloric intake increased from 2,239 calories to 2,455 calories in men , and from 1,534 calories to 1,646 calories in women ( 1 ) .
Are these really enough calories to cause such massive decreases in the health of so many people ?
I do n't think so .
There is one factor , however , that I believe is responsible for the greatest portion of the unhealthy state of our union .
It 's not necessarily how much we 're eating , genetics or even a virus :
It 's what we 're eating .
If a calorie is a calorie is a calorie , as most dieticians , nutritionists and doctors claim , why does n't the percent of increased caloric intake match the percentage of increase in overweight or obese individuals ?
The increase in calorie consumption in men and women has increased 7 percent and 9 percent respectively since the seventies .
The increase in the percentage of individuals who are overweight or obese has increased almost 20 percent in each category .
And remember , this increase literally occurred in less than 30 years , which is less than a generation .
Why such a discrepancy between calories consumed and weight gained ?
Because there 's more to this epidemic than the amount of calories people are consuming .
The food processing industry has dropped the ball when it comes to supplying healthy food for our consumption .
It is blatantly obvious by the ingredients listed on food labels , coupled with the downward spiral of ill health in the U.S. , that the food industry is obsessed with increasing its bottom line with no regard for the negative effects of its products .
It would be naive to assume that this billion - dollar industry has the best intentions for our food 's safety and nutritive value .
Now do n't get me wrong , I am not trying to make excuses for people who overeat and do n't exercise .
I know that the vast majority of overweight individuals eat excessive calories .
But the numbers just do n't add up .
On the other hand , the obesity epidemic and its related afflictions do have a linear relationship to the amount of denatured , devitalized , processed food people consume , especially simple sugars and vegetable oil .
The incidence of overweight and obese individuals , shown by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ( NHANES ) ( Fig. 2 , below ) , has a linear relationship to fructose consumption in the United States ( Fig. 1 ) .
According to the USDA 's data below ( Table 1 ) , total sugar and fructose consumption started to increase sharply in 1985 , and reached a peak in 1999 , which is congruent with the incidence of obesity .
During 2000 through 2005 we see a slight drop in total sugar and fructose consumption , which is consistent with the leveling off of obesity rates during that same period .
This drop in sugar adds up to 10 pounds of total sugar , with fructose contributing six of those pounds .
Even more compelling , the USDA 's data in Table1 below reveals total sugar consumption from 1970 to 1999 increased 26 percent , which at first glance does n't seem like much .
Also note that from 1970 to 1983 total sugar consumption did not increase , while obesity rates did .
This would lead one to infer that sugar is not a major contributing factor to our expanding waistlines .
However , take another look .
While total sugar consumption did not increase from 1970 to 1983 , fructose consumption tripled .
Moreover , between 1970 and 1999 , with only a 26 percent increase in total sugar consumption , fructose consumption increased 425 percent .

In figure 3 ( below ) , take note that while animal fat consumption has decreased , we 've seen a simultaneous increase in total fat consumption that closely mirrors the obesity trend .
Also note , the increase in total fat consumption is due to vegetable oil , which is used for frying , spreads , dressings , etc .

To understand just how far off the beaten path we 've gotten from eating the proper foods vital to our health , we must take a look at what we used to eat prior to the obesity and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) epidemic .
Some researchers have tried to illuminate all the way back to when we were hunter - gatherers .
Unfortunately , because of the limited evidence , there 's a limitless amount of conjecture having to do with the foods our Stone Age ancestors consumed .
However , the one factor agreed upon regarding the Stone Age caveman 's diet , is that it was full of whole , natural , nutrient - dense foods .
Products like vegetable oil and high fructose corn syrup were n't manufactured yet , and sugar was very limited to fruit .
Be that as it may , there are vastly different points of view when discussing the Stone Age diet .
The low - fat politically correct ( PC ) school of thought is that Stone Age man ate small amounts of lean meat with copious amounts of plant foods .
The high - fat school of thought is that Stone Age man placed prime importance on fatty animals first , with plant foods comprising a small percentage of their diet ( 2 ) .
Dr. Walter Voegtlin takes a vastly different approach to deciding what foods the cavemen consumed .
In his book , " The Stone Age Diet , " he makes an argument for the higher fat , high - meat diet by comparing the anatomy and physiology of man to that of herbivorous sheep and a carnivorous dog .
Dr. Voegtlin argues that broad differences in anatomy between man and herbivores are evidence that man did not live on a diet high in plant foods , especially those rich in carbohydrates ( 3 ) .
Humans are carnivorous animals and the Stone Age diet , Dr Voegtlin challenges , was primarily one of a meat and fat eater .
Like the carnivorous dog , our jaw moves in a vertical motion .
A herbivores ' jaw moves in a rotary fashion .
We have canine teeth , ridged molars and incisors designed for crushing and tearing .
Unlike herbivores that lack canines and have flat molars , mastication is unnecessary and we do not ruminate or chew cud .
Our stomachs hold two quarts , empty in about three hours , secrete hydrochloric acid , lack bacteria and cannot digest cellulose .
A herbivorous sheep 's stomach holds eight and a half gallons , never empties , digests cellulose , and bacteria are vital to its function .
A herbivore 's stomach does n't secrete hydrochloric acid , which is primarily for the digestion of protein .
Carnivores like man feed intermittently while herbivores continuously feed ( graze ) .
A herbivore 's digestive tract is five times the size of man 's relative to our body size .
Unlike herbivores , man 's colons are short and our rectums are small and do not contribute to digestion .
Man 's gall bladder has a vital function and is well developed .
The function of a herbivore 's gall bladder is weak or nonexistent because of the lack of fat in their diet .
The volume of feces from man is small because our digestive efficiency borders on 100 percent .
A herbivore 's feces are voluminous because their digestive efficiency is less than or equal to 50 percent , and they must eat large quantities of food .
Stone
Age man , out of necessity , ate food that were very nutrient and energy dense .
Humans , in the Stone Age , by shear lack of availability , could not have consumed a great deal of carbohydrates .
Stone
Age men could n't just walk outside the cave every morning and harvest what they desired for the day .
They harvested what was available .
Fruit was n't and is n't readily available in the wilderness .
And when it is , it 's seasonal .
It 's hard for us to imagine the hard life they led , but a PC diet of mostly fruits , grasses , vegetables and some lean meat just would n't cut it in the harsh environment of early man .
A recurring premise among anthropologists and explorers is that Stone Age man had an extensive diet with a wide range of foods .
Evidence seems to indicate that hunter - gatherers did n't just eat a PC diet of mainly foraged roots and fruit and some lean meat .
Did they eat a diet centered on large animals with a small amount of plant foods thrown in for good measure ?
The Stone Age diet varied from region to region and sometimes accommodated changes within a region like famine and drought .
Being resilient and adapting to the ever - changing environment is the reason Stone Age man survived for millions of years before agriculture .
To put it simply , they lived in conjunction with their environment using what resources were available .
It was n't until about 10,000 years ago that man started agriculture , which is literally a blink of an eye in time .
This is not nearly enough time to physiologically change the way our bodies process food .
The Agricultural Revolution , which saw massive increases in agricultural productivity between 1750 and early 1900 , is responsible for the vast majority of today 's disease .
It is evident that agriculture and human health have an inverse relationship .
As people around the world have consumed more refined carbohydrates , their health has decreased dramatically .
This obviously was an unintended consequence of people looking for better ways to feed their families and growing populations .
Unfortunately , the evidence shows that as people abandon traditional diets revolving around animal sources and other whole natural foods , and replaced them with grains , cereals , other starches and sugar , health problems always follow .
Am I saying we should avoid carbohydrates ?
No .
But the scientific data of the past and present do not support the assertion that a PC diet that is high in carbohydrates and low in fat and protein , is how we should eat to be more healthy .
Fat , especially saturated fat , and protein have been nourishing societies around the world for tens of thousands of years .
Mammals and fish are the most nutritious foods on the planet .
There are nutrients essential to our health that can only be found in animal sources .
There are no plant sources that equal their nutritive value .
The hunter - gatherers or cavemen of North America ate animals that included mammoth , rhinoceros , sloth , bison , mountain sheep , beaver , antelope , elk , mule deer , horse and large dogs .
Mammoth , rhinoceros , bison , beaver , bear and wild pigs are fatty animals in every sense , and their remains have been found at Stone Age sites throughout the world .
Some archeologists believe that the caveman 's selective hunting of fattier animals is what led to the extinction of the larger animals like the mammoth , sloth and rhinoceros ( 2 ) .
Much has been written concerning the diets of cavemen in an attempt to secure credibility for endorsing a particular diet .
The fact remains , however , that the interpretations of the Stone Age diet are just that , interpretations or educated guesses .
The only thing we know for certain is that we did not evolve ( if you believe in evolution ) on a diet consisting of vegetable oil , margarine , cereal , grains , sugar , candy , soy , ( that 's right , soy ) or any other man-made , mass - produced food .
Ma-made , mass - produced products contributed to absolutely none of the Stone Age diet .
Nor do man -made processed foods play a part of healthy traditional societies around the world .
When comparing the diets of different societies to diets in the U.S. , as many explorers and scientists have , it becomes apparent that it's not how much we 're eating as much as what we 're eating .
The Masai and Samburu tribes of Africa exist almost completely on milk , blood and beef .
The Samburu may drink more that a gallon of milk each day , which works out to well over one pound of butterfat .
The Masai do n't drink as much milk as the Samburu , but eat more meat .
Both tribes are virtually free from obesity and modern diseases like CVD and diabetes ( 4 ) .
From 1951 to 1976 the consumption of animal fats in Switzerland increased by 20 percent despite a decrease in milk intake of 46 percent .
Throughout this same period , smoking increased among women but remained the same among men .
If the lipid hypothesis were correct , one would think mortality from cardiovascular disease would also increase .
But to the assumed disdain of proponents of the lipid hypothesis , mortality from CVD decreased by 22 percent in males and 46 percent in females ( 5 ) .
Presently , Switzerland has an obesity rate four times less than the U.S. ( 6 ) .
The average French person consumed 108 grams per day of fat from animal sources in 2002 , while the average American consumed only 72 grams .
The French , whose obesity rate is less than 10 percent ( 6 ) , eat four times the amount of butter , 60 percent more cheese and nearly three times as much pork .
Although the French consume only slightly more total fat ( 171 grams per day versus 157 ) , they consume much more saturated fat .
Americans consume a much larger proportion of fat in the form of vegetable oil , with most of that being soybean oil ( the worst type ) .
Despite eating 50 percent more saturated fat than Americans , the French die two and a half times less from CVD .
This phenomenon is referred to as the French paradox ( 7 ) .
But it is only a paradox if one believes saturated fat and cholesterol are unhealthy .
I do not .
The Japanese life span , the longest of any nation in the world , is generally attributed to a low fat diet .
The Japanese eat about 186 pounds of dairy products and 154 pounds of fish per year .
Their diets contain moderate amounts of animal fats from eggs , pork , chicken , beef , seafood and organ meats .
Egg consumption is higher in Japan than America .
Over the last 50 years consumption of fats increased 15 percent , and the mean cholesterol levels rose from 150 in 1958 to 188 in 1989 .
Despite the facts that the Japanese smoke much more than Americans , and have increased their consumption of fats , they still live longer than any society in the world and have a very low incidence of CVD , and an obesity rate of just over 3 percent ( 8 , 6 ) .
What do countries like Switzerland , France , Japan and a whole host of others have in common ?
The majority of their diets consist of whole natural foods indigenous to their regions of the world .
Unlike America , processed foods are still a small part of their daily food consumption , which corresponds to an increase in overall health and longevity , that many experts attribute to the high nutrient content of their food .
So where do we go from here ?
How do we turn the tide and construct a leaner and healthier you ?
We know we 're unhealthy and we now understand a few of the major reasons why we 're unhealthy .
For many , getting started seems like such an overwhelming undertaking because they 've been so unhealthy for so long .
A lot of this is because conflicting advertisements , articles , books and so - called experts promising the ultimate answer have bombarded them .
People are n't sure what or who to follow , and when they do the vast majority fail .
In Part III , I 'll show you what you need to do in order to become a leaner healthier you .
Like anything worth having , however , it 's going to take some effort .
The only time success precedes work is in the dictionary .

Atari founder Nolan Bushnell is to make a dramatic return to the game development business with a new RTS / FPS hybrid game .
Bushnell , 66 , has seldom worked on videogame projects since he left Atari over thirty years ago , though has steadily built an iconic reputation as the ‘ founding father of videogames ’ during the intervening decades .
Yet the entrepreneur is set to come out of dev retirement with his newest project , a free - to - play game entitled Battleswarm : Field of Honor .
In an interview with USA Today , Bushnell said that Battleswarm was a game aimed at clashing RTS strategies with FPS combat in an online arena .
“ Battleswarm is really about me being able to play against my sons [ laughs ] .
I ’ve got five sons , age 16 through 30 .
They ’re all avid gamers and like first - person shooters .
The problem is , as you get older , you lose some reaction time , and as a result , I ’m getting slaughtered by them , ” he said .
“ A real - time strategy [ RTS ] game , however , is more my [ preference ] , a good resource game is what I love .
Battleswarm is both an RTS and a shooter , a mash - up between StarCraft and Starship Troopers , if you will .
You can switch sides , too , if you feel like an RTS instead of a shooter , or vice - versa . "
Bushnell said his game allows players to choose sides from two competing armed forces .
One side is controlled via an RTS interface ( setting up camps , controlling AI , etc. ) , while the other competes in FPS mode ; sent straight into the action .
The game will be free - to - play with microtransaction - based combat upgrades available .
Bushnell – who remains one of the most recognisable people in the games industry – was at the centre of this year ’s British Academy Video Games Awards after being handed a BAFTA Fellowship ; the highest honour the academy can offer .
Earlier in the year he was appointed as executive advisor to online reward - based gaming platform GameWager .
In March , speaking at a Q&A session co-hosted by BAFTA and Game Based Learning , Bushnell revealed that he believes ‘ physicality ’ is the future of gaming .
" I predict that the next few years will be the years of physicality in gaming , " he said .

BBC technology reporter , Los Angeles
Early shots suggest Avatar will look very impressive
" Before you go any further sir , I 'm going to need your phone , your laptop , your bag , and any photographic equipment you may have on you . "
We 're being stripped of all our technology at the start of a press briefing .
A process which is , to say the least , unusual .
But this is an unusual press conference ; we are about to get the first look at Titanic director James Cameron 's new action adventure movie Avatar and see Ubisoft 's game of the same name .
We are ushered into a room , one side of which is filled with an enormous 103in plasma screen ; a working prototype from Panasonic .
The walls are plastered with concept art .
Then out steps Jon Landau , the film 's producer , who runs through the basic plot .
" The script for Avatar started 14 years ago , but back then , the technology to make a film like that did not exist , " he said .
New territory
The film - and game - follows the exploits of a paralysed marine called Jake Sully who is sent to the beautiful , but dangerous , world of Pandora to help a mining corporation extract a mineral Mr Landau called " unobtanium " .
Humans cannot breathe the air on Pandora , so they have to travel - and work - in cumbersome airtight suits .
The game revolves around the battle for Pandora However , Pandora does have an indigenous population - the Na'vi - a race of 10 foot tall creatures who have no interest in helping humanity exploit , and ultimately destroy , their planet .
So the corporation has created a hybrid creature from both human and Na'vi DNA that is controlled via a mental link by a human operator : the Avatar .
Trouble is , every creature on the planet - plant and animal , including the Na'vi - now want humans off the planet and will use any and every means at their disposal to drive them off .
Humanity is engaged in a fight for survival on Pandora , and it is into this environment that Jake Sully is dropped .
" Our industry has not created a new universe in 32 years , " said Mr Landau .
" We have now . "
A reference , if ever there was one , to George Lucas ' Star Wars which made its debut in 1977 .
Both the game and film were developed in tandem ; so much so that ideas from game developer Ubisoft were incorporated into the movie .
The game , an action adventure shooter , faithfully replicates the movie environment ; in stereoscopic 3D if your monitor is capable .
The graphics , from the little we saw , were impressive and on a par with how stunning Crysis was when it made its public debut .
Foliage , creatures , characters , and weapons are superbly rendered .
By day , the environment is a lush - but oppressive - jungle .
At night the entire planet glows with bioluminescence , making the world look even more alien than it already is .
However , this is just a backdrop to the game , which is predominantly about combat .
Fighting talk Mr Landau stressed that the game 's plot was not a carbon copy of the film .
While the film goes into avatar mode fairly early on , the game lets you play as a human soldier fighting his way through the jungle as the various jungle life forms try their best to kill you .
The game also lets you play as a Na'vi warrior .
While humans may have a technological edge , they also have every plant and animal out to get them .
For the Na'vi , this flora and fauna are not just friends , they are allies .
In the demonstration we were shown how a Na'vi warrior could climb on the back of a large winged creature that could then be used to knock helicopters out of the sky .
Mr Landau said that Jake Sully changes sides and helps the Na'vi " lead a revolution to force the humans - and avatars - off Pandora " .
The catch , said Mr Landau , is that when Sully is in avatar mode , he is fully mobile ; back in human form , he is confined to a wheelchair .
" It 's a moral dilemma that he will have to face . "
It remains to be seen if this moral dilemma from the movie will be replicated in the game .
Both film and game are due for release at the end of 2009 .

JOHN McFARLAND - DALLAS ( AP ) — Federal regulators have frozen the assets of a Delaware company accused of swindling nearly 8,000 investors in a $ 485 million Ponzi scheme that falsely promised hefty returns on investments in the oil and gas business , officials said Tuesday .
Three businessmen in Dallas , where Provident Royalties LLC has its main office , ran the nationwide operation involving fraudulent securities offerings between June 2006 and January 2009 , the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in civil complaint filed in a North Texas federal court .
" Provident sold ostensibly safe securities such as preferred stock to thousands of investors , " Ken Israel , Director of the SEC's Salt Lake Regional Office , said in a statement .
" But it was actually operating a Ponzi - like shell game in which assets were shuttled from one entity to another and investors were paid ' returns ' from whatever money was available — usually that of the most recent investors . "
Phone messages left with Provident , which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection June 22 , were not returned Tuesday .
According to the SEC 's complaint , Provident promised yearly returns of up to 18 percent and made fraudulent securities offerings through 21 affiliated entities to more than 7,700 investors .
The SEC claims Provident said 85 percent of funds raised through the offerings would go toward interests in oil and gas real estate , leases , mineral rights exploration and development .
But the SEC said less than half of that money was actually used for that purpose .
Investments in the scheme were typically between $ 25,000 and $ 250,000 , with a few over $ 1 million , said Tom Melton , a senior regional trial counsel with the SEC .
" It 's big , but it was a lot of little people who got taken , " Melton said .
The order to freeze the assets and to place Provident in receivership was approved last week and unsealed Tuesday .
It 's still too early in the investigation to tell how much money 's left , and Melton said it could take up to a year to sort it all out .
The SEC complaint names three co-founders and managers of Provident , Paul R. Melbye , Brendan Coughlin and Henry Harrison ; Provident ; broker - dealer Provident Asset Management LLC ; and 21 other entities that offered and sold securities .
Messages at Melbye's and Coughlin 's home numbers were n't returned , and Harrison 's is unlisted .
Melton said all three founders and managers of Provident wound up with some of the invested funds , but it 's unclear how much .
Coughlin , 43 , and Harrison , 44 , each took about $ 6 million , he said .
He said Melbye , 44 , took an undetermined amount .
The SEC complaint charges the defendants with violating anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws .
FBI Special Agent Mark
White in the Dallas office would not confirm whether a criminal investigation was under way .
Air Force ' X - 1 ' Mustang by Galpin Auto Sports
Air Force ' Vapor ' Challenger by Galpin Auto Sports
It 's no secret that the U.S. military has had recruitment problems in recent years .
As a result , each branch has been forced to hone its marketing skills and speak more persuasively to potential enlistees .
The Air Force 's new Project : Supercar campaign is a spectacular example of how that that savvy can be put into service .
In a nutshell , the USAF hired Galpin Auto Sports to transform a Ford Mustang and a Dodge Challenger into serious supercars .
The goal : to draw young gearheads to Air Force recruitment events .
The result : the " X - 1 " Mustang and the " Vapor " Challenger .
On the outside , both cars look vaguely similar to other souped - up rides , with scissor - doors , carbon fiber - trim , and other tuner - ish bling .
On the inside , however , the Air Force influence becomes startlingly clear .
The X - 1 is tricked - out like a jet cockpit , with an ejection seat ( non-functioning , we assume ) and an instrumentation panel to make any gizmo junkie 's heart race .
The Vapor 's interior is done in two - seat style , with a bonus steering wheel for the passenger and a special " stealth mode " for the exhaust system .
If the Air Force was looking for " shock and awe " , Galpin totally delivered .
However , the Project : Supercar campaign does raise a couple of questions :
♦ Would we have to take a physical to score a ride in one of these babies ?
♦ Does any enlistee really expect to receive one of these after signing on the dotted line ?
♦ How long until we can get the Vapor 's " radar - absorbing paint " on our Chevettes ?
If you 're interested , you can visit the USAF 's flash - heavy site for vid clips about the making of the X - 1 and the Vapor .
( Unfortunately , the Air Force seems to have gotten the memo about teens and badass cars , but not about embeddable videos .
You'd think an org that has the word " cyberspace " in its motto might know better . )
And if you 're really interested , a press release about the whole thing is below .
Now , as you were .

Galpin Auto Sports PARTNERS WITH U.S. Air Force TO CREATE
Two “ SUPERCARS ”
Built for the 2009 Recruiting Tour : the ‘ X - 1 ’ Ford Mustang and ‘ Vapor ’ Dodge Challenger Feature Hyper - Advanced Technology and Design
NORTH HILLS , Calif. ( June 1 , 2009 ) – Galpin Auto Sports collaborated with the United States Air Force to create two customized vehicles for its 2009 Super Car Tour – a new U.S. Air Force recruiting initiative that kicked off in May .
The white Ford Mustang ‘ X - 1 ’ and black Dodge Challenger ‘ VAPOR ’ are Air Force - inspired designs that will travel across the country this year as part of a mobile marketing campaign to educate young people on the mechanical and technical career opportunities available within the Air Force .
Southern California based Galpin Auto Sports is widely known for its corporate and one - off vehicle designs , through its involvement with various movies and TV projects , including the 2008 “ Knight Rider ” series ’ KITT car , the upcoming movie car in the thriller “ The Red Mist ” and the acting - home base of MTV’s “ Pimp My Ride ” .
“ For Galpin Auto Sports to be commissioned by the most technologically advanced organization on Earth is truly an honor ” said Beau Boeckmann , Chief Designer for Galpin Auto Sports .

The vehicles are a combination of form , function and futuristic entertainment all fueled together .
To see the entire build of the X - 1 and Vapor , please visit : http://www.airforce.com/supercar/.
Representing the muscle of the Air Force , the ‘ X - 1 ’ Mustang is a heavenly matte - pearlescent painted supercar with a jet cockpit that includes a single - driver ejection seat in center of vehicle , short shifter , flight stick , and advanced instrumentation panel .
The ‘ X - 1 ’ also has a concealed motorized steering wheel , custom foot pedals , GPS transponder and the innovative dash is equipped with a touch screen monitor and sensor pack that displays night and thermal vision .
The 4.6 liter engine includes 3 - valve Ford Racing heads , cold air intake , hot rod cams , and long tube headers creating 500 hp and is maintained by a custom Ford Racing Tuning Program .
The Vertical doors feature interior panel fabrication to complete the ‘ jet - like ’ feel of the ‘ X - 1 ’ , which will appear on the East Coast portion of the Air Force recruiting tour .
The stealth - black Air Force Challenger ‘ Vapor ’ features a biometric access to open the Vertical doors , a custom Stealth body kit with Jet enhancements and a carbon fiber exterior trim .
Other exterior components include one - off carbon fiber wheels , a custom stealth exhaust mode that allows the vehicle to run in complete silence or you can open up the headers to facilitate the aggressive sound of the engine , shaker hood , radar - absorbing paint , proximity sensors , and a 360 - degree camera with ¼ mile range .
The interior of the ‘ Vapor ’ is complete with aircraft style controls , a passenger side steering wheel , GPS tracking , night and thermal vision via a film on the front windshield , and the most technologically - advanced computer system with remote control UAV - type access from anywhere in the world utilizing the internet .
The ‘ Vapor ’ also comes with two custom flight helmets in line with the Air Force theme of the vehicle .
The vehicles recently debuted in Austin , Texas under Brigadier General AJ Stewart , commander of Air Force Recruiting Service as well as 60 U.S. Air Force marketers and GSD&M Idea City .
Galpin Auto Sport ’s Lead Customizer , Mad Mike , was present for the unveiling and felt a personal connection to this project having started his career in the Air Force .
“ If it was not for the U.S. Air Force , I would not have the knowledge and skills that enables me to stand where I am today . ” said Mad Mike .
" We ’re looking for hands - on people to serve in critical Air Force jobs and we ’re fortunate to be working with exactly those kinds of professionals at Galpin , ” said Daniel Elkins , U.S. Air Force Recruiting Services .
" The Super Car Tour is illustrative of the kinds of opportunities available in the Air Force where technology knows no limit . "
The 2009 Super Car Tour will primarily visit high schools and a variety of Air Force sponsored events including the DUB magazine auto show , Hot Import Nights , Battle of the Imports , Formula Drift , International Hot Rod Association and local community events .

Like an obnoxious city banker who 's half cut , tie undone , creased - shirt billowing out of trousers with drool dripping from his sticky red lips eyeing that 28 - year - old brunette sat with her lover at the bar , Manchester City will not give up the chase for John Terry – no matter how much self - respect they 've frittered away after again slapping their bulging crocodile skin wallet in front of the pair and winking furiously at the increasingly irritated other half .
Not content with having had the knock back at first £ 30 m , and then £ 32 m , Mark Hughes will now wave £ 40 m in front of Roman Abramovich 's blank face and dare him to pluck the cash out of his hands in return for the Chelsea captain .
Quite why Hughes has never considered the unloved curly - haired bit of talent called Ricardo Carvalho is a mystery which will trouble the Mill for at least as long as it takes to finish this sentence .
Anyway , the Portuguese has accepted he wo n't be able to join up with Jose Mourinho at Inter and is duty - bound to stay at Stamford Bridge so that boat may have already set sail .
If City fail in their relentless pursuit of JT , they will likely leave £ 15 m in Everton 's car park and race off down the M62 with Joleon Lescott tied up in the boot .
In other Merseyside - related news , Hull City fancy a piece of that blond with the ponytail at Anfield .
Well Andriy Voronin to be precise .
Having managed to put one foot in front of the other regularly at Hertha Berlin , thus giving the impression of a functioning striker , they reckon he 's the man to keep them up next year .
And in the daily Xabi Alonso - to - Real - Madrid - does - anybody - really - think - it - wo n't - happen saga the Liverpool midfielder has said he reckons Madrid have an " impressive project " going on but he does not know how things will turn out because he's not a " fortune teller " .
Which is strange , because when Florentino Pérez digs deep enough to offer Rafa Benítez a fortune for him – around £ 35 m – the Mill 's got a good idea where he 'll end up .
Arséne Wenger intends to fill the Emmanuel Adebayor - sized hole in his Arsenal front line with Toulouse striker André - Pierre Gignac .
He 's young , he 's tall , he 's French , he 'll cost £ 18 m , but of course , Wenger being Wenger , he wo n't budge from £ 13 m .
Tottenham manager ' Arry Redknapp is wearing a balaclava and stalking the A1 where he hopes to intercept the delivery of Portsmouth 's Peter Crouch to Sunderland and drag the big man back to White Hart Lane .
He 'll have to post a cheque to Fratton Park for £ 12 m mind , to avoid kidnap charges and what - not .
He 'll raise £ 4 m of that by offloading Chris Gunter to Preston North End .
Having been subject to barbarous text - speak such as " Is evil something u are ... or something u do ? " from a boy band called Riot Squ ... oh from La Galaxy 's really scary hardcore section of fans called the Riot Squad , David Beckham will try to hug as many Milan players as possible until every one of them tells their manager Leonardo that he 's such a nice guy that they do n't mind doing all of his running for him providing he kisses them when they 've scored a goal .
Blackburn 's Sam Allardyce has sent the soon - to - be fossilised trialist Christian Vieri packing after realising the former Italian international striker 's waist was almost as big as his own .
Manchester United 's bean - counters have n't got the £ 21 m worth of beans required to bring Gremio 's 18 - year - old striker Douglas Costa to Old Trafford .
They managed to count £ 8 m before resorting to looking down the sides of the couch .
Having not been able to tempt West Brom to part with Jonathan Greening for £ 2.5 m
Fulham will dig £ 3.5 m deeper to sign Juventus 's Danish midfielder Christian Poulsen .
The Mill 's a bit under the weather today , so please give it a push by posting your gossip and transfer tittle - tattle in the comments section below .
Jose Canseco , whose 2005 book arguably started the cascade of revelations and an investigation into the use of performance - enhancing drugs in baseball , barely raised an eyebrow when he was told David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez are reportedly on the list of 104 players who tested positive in 2003 .
" When you tell me something I did n't already know , I 'll be surprised , " Canseco told ESPN .
" And I 'll tell you this , Major League Baseball is going to have a big , big problem on their hands when they find out they have a Hall of Famer who 's used . "
When asked to name who that Hall of Fame player is , Canseco refused to divulge who he believes it is .
" It 's not about naming names , " he said .
" I 've never had anything against the players .
It 's always been against Major League Baseball .
I know who 's on that list , but like I said , it 's not about attacking the players .
It 's about the machine that allowed this to happen .
What I speak out of my mouth is the truth .
It burns like fire .
Just remember , I have never lied about this subject . "
In Canseco 's book , " Juiced : Wild Times , Rampant ' roids and Smash Hits and How Baseball Got Big , " he detailed what he called the game 's rampant use of performance - enhancing drugs .
He was initially vilified , but most of his allegations subsequently have proved to be true .
At the time , in 2005 , Canseco said he believed 80 percent of big league players were using some substance to enhance their statistics .
He since has amended that number .
" If you were in the game in the last 20 years , there 's a 95 percent chance you were knowingly using something , '' Canseco said .
" I said 80 percent back then because that was the number of players that I knew were on .
But that number was greater . ''
Canseco , whose career spanned 17 seasons and included 462 home runs , said Major League Baseball could be staring at a far greater problem than just the list of 104 players potentially being released .
" If the players turn on Major League Baseball , it 's going to get far worse and ugly , " he said .
" They created this mess because they could n't control the list of 104 .
Baseball could be looking at a major class - action lawsuit if the players decide to band together .
This list was supposed to be confidential .
We 're seeing that , like Watergate , the cover - up always blows up in your face .
It may take five , 10 , 15 years , but the forensic files always seem to surface .
Again , tell me if I 've ever lied when it comes to this ? "
ESPN legal analyst Lester Munson said Canseco 's claim of a class - action lawsuit is probably baseless on several fronts .
" One reason is that the government is involved , " Munson said .
" The FBI and the IRS came into those labs and took those samples and the scorecards to tell who was who on the list .
If the players sued the players ' union and Major League Baseball , those two would say it was n't them , it was the government .
" Could they get a lawyer to file a case ?
Without a doubt .
But I do n't see it as a really strong case .
It 's an interesting idea , but it would probably be dismissed quickly . "
Pedro Gomez is a reporter for ESPN .
When Arizona - based rapper Random created his 2007 indie - hop effort Mega Ran out of his love of Capcom 's old - school game Mega Man , he expected trouble , perhaps a lawsuit .
Instead , Capcom invited him to rule its Comic - Con International booth and then bankrolled the 2009 follow - up , Mega Ran 9 , released in March .
" It 's pretty amazing , and relieving , " Random , known as Raheem Jarboe to the IRS , explained to Wired.com in an e-mail interview .
As one of Capcom 's most successful entries , Mega Man has always had a healthy share of devotees .
But Random never thought that his childhood love of quests to steal weapons from Robot Masters would lead to raps about wooing Splash Woman , the first boss character in the franchise .
Yet Jarboe , who teaches when he's not crafting chiptunes , understands that there is a lesson to be learned here .
" Hip - hop has been built on false images for so long , " he says .
" Nerd is the new cool . "
Wired.com :
How does it feel to not be sued by Capcom ?
Random :
It 's pretty amazing , and relieving .
I can't say I ever expected it .
I think inside of most hip - hop heads , deep down is the soul of a gamer .
It seemed almost taboo to combine both loves , because hip - hop is so much about what 's cool and tough .
I never felt that I 'd be able to fully embrace that side , let alone be successful with it .
Wired.com :
How is the album doing ?
I hear it 's Rahm Nation 's top - seller .
Random :
The album is exceeding my expectations .
Right now , it 's sold out at UndergroundHipHop.com , which is even more shocking , because the big sellers there are folks like Talib Kweli and MF Doom , who I really respect .
It 's wild , because I gave it away for free for almost a month , and it 's now over 7,000 downloads .
No one knows the formula for selling records these days , not even the bigwigs .
So to give 80 percent of an album away and then sell it , and still have it sell well , tells me a lot .
It tells me that if you make a product for a core audience , and are genuine in your approach , people will see that and want to support it .
Oh , and it can't suck .
Wired.com :
Are you thinking of turning this into a trend with other games you dug as a kid ?
Random : I thought about it .
In fact , I have plans right now for a new videogame album .
I 've told them to the Mega Ran crew and they 're all for it .
I do n't want to formally announce it yet , because it might not come this year or even next .
But what will happen is my album with K - Murdock called Forever Famicom .
He 's gonna sample some of my favorite Nintendo Entertainment System games like Faxanadu , EarthBound , Street Fighter 2010 and more .
We 're gonna have some fun .
We 've secured an arrangement with a label in Japan ( of course ) , so the next album will drop over there as an import only .
But I 'll drop a North American counterpart as well .
Wired.com : Capcom invited you to Comic - Con last year .
How did that go ?
Random :
That was amazing .
Myself and DN3 got to hang out at the Capcom booth , and they played the Mega Ran tunes out of the speakers .
I signed autographs and met a bunch of great fans .
Just to be able to walk through Comic - Con with a badge that said " Raheem Jarbo : Capcom Entertainment : Exhibitor " was surreal .
I met Sgt. Slaughter , for crying out loud .
The folks at Capcom tell me they 're looking to work me into the mix this year as well .
Wired.com :
You 're a teacher :
What is the lesson here ?
Random :
That you can definitely draw inspiration from anything .
I went from listening to Mega Man MP3s online to traveling the country .
Anything can happen .
It turns out that there were people out there who were waiting for someone to take the idea and run with it .
I 've had so many people at shows tell me , " I was thinking about rapping over videogame beats ! "
But I think it 's more than that .
It takes heart to embrace your childhood and take a bold step forward .
That has made this successful .
I mean , I 'm far from the first musician to experiment and try to branch out , so I 'm hoping that this can show hip - hop artists that it 's OK to be true to yourself .
This is what us educators call a " teachable moment . "
You get about 10 of those a day , at any given time ... and I think you just backed me into one !
Wired.com :
Well , I think efforts like this help technoculture take hip - hop more seriously than it already does .
Random : Rappers are n't considered musicians by a great majority .
But I 'll be the first to tell you that it takes some serious musicianship to be good at it .
Now , to make money , well that 's a different story .
Hip - hop has been built on false images for so long , so maybe " keeping it real " is becoming cool , for real .
Nerd is the new cool .

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
Roughly half of Israelis support bombing Iran 's nuclear facilities if international efforts fail to stop the Islamic republic from developing nuclear weapons , according to a Hebrew University poll released Sunday .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans a major speech on peace and security .
Some 52 percent of Israelis say the country should bomb Iran 's nuclear reactor , while 35 percent are against , the poll found .
The margin of error in the poll of Israelis is 4.5 percentage points .
Palestinians are somewhat more evenly divided , with 43 percent saying a nuclear Iran would be good for the Arab world and 33 percent saying it would be bad , according to the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah , which conducted the poll along with Hebrew University .
The margin of error for the Palestinian sample is 3 percentage points .
Hebrew University released the poll shortly before Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to make what he called a major speech to lay out his plan for the country 's peace and security .
" We want to achieve peace with the Palestinians and with the countries of the Arab world , while attempting to reach maximum understanding with the United States and our friends around the world , " Netanyahu said on June 7 in announcing the speech .
" My aspiration is to achieve a stable peace that rests on a solid foundation of security for the State of Israel and its citizens . "
Netanyahu , of the center - right Likud party , has pointedly refused to endorse a two - state solution .
President Obama in Cairo endorsed a two - state solution and urged compromise between " two peoples with legitimate aspirations . "
Obama repeated his call for both Israel and the Palestinians to fulfill all obligations under the 2003 roadmap to peace , including a halt to any expansion of West Bank settlements by Israel .
He also dispatched special envoy George Mitchell to the region to try to kick - start the negotiating process .
He called America 's bond with Israel " unbreakable " but also rejected the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements and said Palestinians have suffered in pursuit of a homeland .
He also called for an end of Palestinian incitement against Israel , and greater security in Palestinian territories .
Hebrew University surveyed 606 adult Israelis by phone in Hebrew , Arabic or Russian between May 24 and June 3 .
The Palestinian sample size was 1,270 adults interviewed face - to - face in the West Bank , East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in 127 randomly selected locations between May 21 and 23 .

The Benefits Of Using Couponing Websites When Doing Online Shopping
The prices of goods and services are on the rise daily because of the economic situation of the world caused by inflation .
Many consumers are looking for ways to cut the amount they spend on shopping while saving as much as they can .
Luckily , coupons are avenues by which consumers can cut costs on shopping online .
What Are Coupons ?
The introduction of coupons became necessary because marketers and people who run online stores are under pressure to sell and dispose of their commodities .
As you can find on TheQoupon.com another avenue where consumers are attracted to patronize online shopping sites is discounts on products up for sale .
In the past , you will only find coupons in the newspaper and magazine .
Today , however , the advent of the internet has provided a platform through which manufacturers can market their products and offer deals via using online coupon codes .
To access these coupons , all you need to do is to search for the website on a search engine or on coupons & discounts websites , sign up to a company that is offering coupons to check out the newest and the best deals that suits you .
One example would be the Pso Rite coupon code from theqoupon.com .
Since you are not obligated to purchase products immediately , you can redeem the offers on your promotional codes via online shopping sites anytime you like .
This is one advantage that using coupons guarantee you .
Benefits Of Using Coupons
You Get To Buy More For Less Money
You save a lot of money when you shop online using coupons .
The goods and commodities you would have bought at a high price , get reduced when you tender a coupon .
Also , when you use a coupon , you get to buy the goods on a wholesale price , and that is a lot cheaper .
Coupons are normally placed on items that have a long shelf life .
When you buy items like toiletries , tissue papers , etc. in bulk , it saves you time and effort going back to the store .
You Get To Buy You Desired Product
There are situations where you want to buy certain goods , but your budget may not permit it until the price drops .
The use of coupons from couponing websites as TheQoupon.com can allow you to buy that product .
There ’s a misconception among people who do n’t use coupons .
This is often because they associate the use of coupons with inferior commodities , but this is not true .
Coupons are one of the ways manufacturers get customers .
Propose When You Should Buy
Coupons are n’t always available for pickup .
This is the same with promotions run by marketers .
There is always a window open for such things , and you will need to act quickly to pick them up .
Coupon websites suggest when you should buy things .
It helps consumers to plan their shopping and also dictates when a manufacturer should display their products for sale .
To Wrap It Up
The use of coupons or couponing websites like TheQoupon.com is a win-win for both manufacturers and consumers .
For the manufacturers , they get double patronage from customers more than they ’ll usually get when products are sold at retail prices .
For the consumers , you get to save time , money , and also get a healthy budget .
Well , Dilma has really already spoken for the Brazilian government .
I did n't need to say anything at all here today , because I think that passing through that gauntlet that I went through to get here was already worth at least four speeches .
But I would like to say hello to my colleagues from the Ministry who are here with us .
I would like to say hello to the national deputies , our senators , our former governor Olívio Dutra , mayor Fogaça .
I would like to say hello to a special guest who got here late today , who is our colleague Lourdes Munhoz , from Spain , representative for Barcelona and who advises President Zapatero on free software issues .
I have n't seen her face yet because she did n't introduce herself here .
Stand up , please .
I want to say hello to our beloved university president Joaquim Clotet .
I want to say hello to our dear colleague Marcelo Branco , the general coordinator of the 10th International Free Software Forum .
I want to say hello to the various colleagues from Brazilian public entities who are here .
I 'm seeing right in front of me the Bank of Brazil and also Serpro .
I want to say hello also to our guests from abroad .
I want to say hello to that little girl who is on someone 's lap over there , who must be wondering what we 're doing here and why her parents brought her here .
One day , she 's going to understand .
And I want to say hello to a special person who is here , who is Sérgio Amadeu , because once the dish is cooked ...
Oh , I also want to say hello to Tigre , our president of the Industrial Federation of Rio Grande do Sul .
Once the dish is cooked , it 's easy for us to eat it .
But cooking this dish was no joke .
I remember the first meeting that we had , in Granja do Torto , where I understood absolutely none of the language that these people were using and there was an enormous tension between those who were defending Brazil 's adoption of free software and those who though that were should keep on doing just the same as always , keep on going the same way , buying , paying for other people 's intelligence , and , thank God , in Brazil the issue and the choice for free software prevailed .
We had to choose : either we could go to the kitchen to prepare the dish that we wanted to eat with the flavors that we wanted to add and we could put a little Brazilian flavor into the food , or we could go eat what Microsoft wanted to sell us .
Simply speaking , the idea of freedom won .
I would like to mention one thing , because the free software issue has won , in my mind .
You know that I was never a Communist .
When they asked me if I was a Communist , I said that I was a machinist .
But I have remarkable colleagues who participated in the armed struggle in this country , colleagues who belonged to the very different parties and ideological currents in this world , all remarkable colleagues .
I had an older brother who tried his whole life to convert me to the Party , and my brother would bring me , worn - out , all the documents that they had written 200 or 150 years ago .
My brother wanted me to memorize the Manifesto , he wanted me to read and reread Das Kapital , and wanted me to discuss all of this , and I would say to my brother : Brother Chico , all this was produced so long ago .
Ca n't we start to create something new now ?
When the Berlin Wall fell , I was happy because it was going to allow the young people to reconsider things and write new things and build new theories , because it had seemed that everything had been built and that nothing could be different .
Free software is a little bit like that : in other words , it means giving people the opportunity to do new things , to create new things , to value people 's individuality .
Because there is n't anything that guarantees freedom more than if you guarantee individual freedom , than if people let their creativity flourish , if they let their intelligence flourish , above all in a new country like Brazil , in which our people 's creativity may possibly make them , without any disrespect to other peoples , the most creative people of the 21st century .
But all right , I think that our government has already done a lot , but our government could have done more .
We are a very democratic government .
I do n't believe that there is anywhere in the world a government that practices democracy as our government does .
I do n't believe that there is .
I do n't believe that there anyone in the world who debates as much , who discusses as much as our government does .
And sometimes that makes things complicated , does n't it , Tarso ?
Sometimes we have to hear things once , twice , three times , because since I 'm illiterate in this Internet thing -- my children are all experts compared to me .
Since the Internet has an amazing property , Olívio : it 's the first time that grandchildren are cleverer than their grandparents .
It 's the first time .
In the old days , just because you were older , you wanted to impose yourself on everything , right ?
Your child could n't talk when you were talking , you could n't give your opinion in the grown - ups ' conversation .
No more .
Now there are two geniuses standing talking in the garage and there 's a little kid and they say : " How do you change the TV channel ? "
You only have to have two remote controls and people do n't know how to work it .
But the eight - year - old kid goes and he mixes , remixes , turns it back and forth , rents a house , pays the rent , pays the electric bill , pays the water bill .
So I think that we are living in a revolutionary moment for humanity , in which the press no longer has the power that it had a few years ago , in which information is no longer a selective thing where the owners of information can stage a coup d'etat , in which information is no longer a privileged thing .
The evening newspaper is already old in the face of the Internet , or of the radio broadcast ; if it does n't come out live , if it comes out recorded , it 's already gotten out of date compared to the Internet .
The newspaper is coming to seem very old compared to the Internet , and it 's getting so old that all the newspapers created a blog to report on the whole world together with the Internet users .
Well , these things , these things -- none of us knows where they 're going to stop , we do n't know , do we ?
I know that every time that I talk with you , I start to think that if my generation were as intelligent and as creative as yours , we would be much better off than we are today , because the machinery of the state is a complex thing .
It 's full of bad habits , norms , you know , that come from the era of the Empire .
And if you try to change these things , well , a bureaucrat has a manual , and the manual just says what can happen and what can't happen .
If you present a new idea , it 's forbidden .
It is n't able to say : " OK , I have something new here , let me try to work it out " , no .
It says it can happen or can't happen .
And that means that it takes time for the government to start to create conditions that allow them to arrive at the level that we 've arrived at .
I 'm going to tell you about something : five years ago , we tried to acquire our own business -- look how silly .
For us to buy our own business .
It was ours , but when the electrical system in Brazil was privatized , the fiber optic network was also privatized and a company called Eletronet was created , which was the American company AES , which did n't comply with its obligations and failed .
Then , by agreement , by contract , Eletronet was the government's .
And so we then tried to once again get hold of Eletronet so that we could bring Internet , you see , to all Brazilian homes where the network existed , on the whole Brazilian transmission system , including the Petrobras oil and gas pipelines .
We could n't buy it .
This is still in court .
I mean , they want us to pay a fortune for what is already ours .
It 's been in court for more than five years .
There is a receiver who wants to get more than what the company is worth .
And we still have n't gotten Eletronet back , even though it should be a public resource of the people of Brazil .
Just to show you the difficulty that we have .
And I think that there 's something happening in the world , which I think is fantastic .
I , when I see a 15 or 16 - year - old boy , when I see my seven - year - old grandson communicating with the entire world , I start to think : what 's going to happen 20 , 30 , or 40 years from now with the kind of availability of knowledge that 's arriving in people 's homes ?
We had the first challenge : making sure computers got to the poorest people .
If you work in the government you know how much time we 've spend discussing the Computer for All .
What did we want ?
We wanted computers to arrive on the edges of the country , for the people who did n't earn much , for people who could pay , at the time , an installment of R$ 50 .
We did n't want to give it away for free ; we wanted to sell it .
We created a special financing program at BNDES to finance the retail market to allow it to get cheaper .
Yesterday I had a retail market meeting and the biggest purchase in the stores today is the computer .
Not even the computer , now they 've invented something new , it 's a notebook .
They 've already taken a step forward .
Nobody wants to sit at a table to deal with their computer anymore , they want to put this puppy on their lap .
So it 's a great thing that 's already happening .
Now I was just unveiling the Light for All program , and it's important for the foreigners here to understand this .
Light for
All is a federal government program to bring electrical energy , especially in the countryside , in the indigenous communities , in the quilombos , to people who do n't have electricity .
In 2004 , Dilma presented a proposal to me to serve 10 million people by 2008 , according to IBGE 's numbers .
On Monday I went to unveil the connection of 2,400,000 homes .
You know what happened ?
Pay attention , Dilma .
Tell your office to take notes : of the people who got Light for All , 83 % bought a television ; 79 % bought a refrigerator ; 47 % bought a sound system .
And we did n't measure computers .
Sérgio , the truth is that now , that same discussion that we had about bringing computers to poor people , now we have are going to have to make the decision to finance computers for our comrades who have received electricity after 500 years in Brazil .
That is , we took people out of the 18th century , we put them in 21st century , and so they have the right to have a computer so that their children can arrive in the 21st century right away .
We ... I 'm going to stop ... after I talk about Azeredo 's bill , which I see some people with a banner there asking me to veto even before it passes .
First , we have to struggle a lot .
But let me tell you something .
In computer science , we ... Sergio Rezende , our minister of Science and Technology , is here .
In the Mathematical Olympiad ... you know that in 2004 , we had a Mathematical Olympiad that had 270,000 students from private schools .
When I proposed having the Mathematical Olympiad in the public schools -- Tarso was the minister -- some people told us : " No , public school children would n't be interested " .
In 2005 10,500,000 people signed up ; in 2006 , 14,000,000 people signed up ; in 2007 , 17,000,000 people ; in 2008 , 18,300,000 ; and now for 2009 , 19,200,000 children from 5th to 2nd grades have signed up for the Mathematical Olympiad .
Previously , the largest Olympiad was the American version , which had around 6,000,000 students registered .
Now ours has 19,300,000 .
Of these , there are 300 who received a medal , either bronze , silver , or gold , and of these , 30 are three - time gold medal winners .
There is a boy who is a genius , and how he went to school ... he 's quadriplegic , he 's almost blind , he 's almost deaf , and he can't walk .
This boy went to school , his father rolled him there in a wheelbarrow , and this boy is a three - time champion at the Mathematical Olympiad .
Now we have created a Portuguese Olympiad .
In the first one we had 6,000,000 children , and this year we 're starting the Science Olympiad , which are the three most difficult subjects for our people here .
So all these kids who won gold medals are geniuses .
So free software offers the possibility for these kids to reinvent things which need to be reinvented .
What do we need ?
Opportunity .
You can be sure of one thing , my friends , that in this government it is forbidden to forbid .
In this government ... what we need in this government is discussion .
The businesspeople know how much we discuss , without rancor , without insults , without trying to weaken a competitor , right ?
We need to debate , we need to strengthen democracy and bring it to its eventual results .
Because this country is still getting to know itself , since for centuries we were treated as if we were third - class citizens , we had to ask permission to do things , we could only do what the United States allowed , what Europe allowed .
And our self - esteem is good .
We are learning to like ourselves .
We are discovering that we can do things .
We are discovering that nobody is better than we are .
Maybe equal , but not better : there is no one more creative than we are .
What we need is an opportunity .
This law here , this law here , it does n't aim to fix the abuse of the Internet .
It really tries to impose censorship .
What we need , Tarso Genro , my friend , who knows , might be to change the Civil Code , who knows , it might be to change anything .
What we need is to make the people who work with the digital issues , with the Internet , responsible .
We need to create responsibility but not to forbid or punish .
... it 's the police 's interest in making a law which lets people go into people 's homes to see what people are doing , even confiscating their computers .
It 's not possible , it 's not possible .
So my dear Marcelo , I wanted to tell you today -- I do n't know what my colleagues think .
For me , this is a glorious , glorious day , because I have a special advisor who takes care of digital issues , my friend Marcelo , I have ... the government has ten ministers who talk about digital inclusion .
Digital inclusion is the sexiest word in the government , you know ?
It 's the sexiest word -- everybody 's talking about it .
And so I needed a coordinator who speaks a language I understand , and I put in my colleague César Alvarez , who is a southerner from here in Rio Grande do Sul , a fan of the Internacional soccer team , which out of kindness is just going to tie the Corinthians team on Wednesday .
Olívio Dutra is an advisor and I 've asked him to talk to the Internacional directors : a zero - to - zero tie would be good , Olívio , there 's no problem .
But so I think , with this leadership , we are trying to move forward .
I just wanted to say one thing to you : look , I have another year and a half left in my term .
One and a half more years .
It 's important for you to figure out what we 've already done and what still needs to be improved .
And I need you to figure out what we still have n't managed to do and help us do it .
Because the problem with government is n't always about money .
Sometimes people have 500 projects and these pieces of news end up getting pushed into the background , and that 's why we have management .
And we 'll see , my friends , if all these numbers that Dilma gave you , about our intention to make this an inclusive country , to make sure that children from the edge of town have the same rights as the children of the rich , to have Internet access , to be able to educate themselves , to be able to move freely around this world of the Internet -- help us make it happen .
Be sure of one thing , Marcelo : we do n't know everything , we only know one part .
I imagine that maybe you do n't know everything either , that maybe you only know one part .
But if we combine a little bit of what each one of you knows , we could produce a whole which we are definitely missing to really democratize this country , and so that everyone can be free to do good things .
Good people are the majority .
We do n't need to get nervous because every once in a while some crazy person shows up saying stuff .
There is even a site advocating killing Lula .
It 's not a problem , people who advocate life are infinitely more numerous .
Infinitely more numerous .
So I want to say to you that entering that gauntlet and seeing that extraordinary range of boys and girls , I think all under 25 or 30 years old , means that we can go out of here and say loud and clear : " This country has finally found itself .
This country is finally tasting freedom of information . "
Thanks , and have a good meeting .

Kaguya is a Japanese spacecraft that has been orbiting the Moon since October 2007 .
It is equipped with several detectors , but also — brilliantly , in my opinion — two HD cameras .
The footage below is not a simulation : it ’s real imagery of the Moon !
Make sure you click the HD button , or go to the YouTube page to see this in full resolution .
This next footage is of the crater Antoniadi , and is stunning .
Note the lens flares from sunlight entering the camera and reflecting inside .
I was surprised to learn that the end of Kaguya ’s mission will come next week , on June 10 !
At 18:30 GMT it will impact the lunar surface ; this is on the near side of the Moon but in the unlit portion , so that the impact can be studied by ground - based telescopes .
This is just past full Moon , so the impact point will just barely be after local sunset on the Moon .
I do n’t know if the impact will be visible to small telescopes or not ; I rather doubt it ( though I ’m sure it wo n’t be visible to the unaided eye ! ) , but I ’ll post more info as I find it .

Having been away for four months , Hildy Johnson walks into the offices of the New York City based The Morning Post , where she is a star reporter , to tell her boss , editor Walter Burns , that she is quitting .
The reason for her absence was among other things to get a Reno divorce , from , of all people , Walter , who admits he was a bad husband .
Hildy divorced Walter largely because she wanted more of a home life , whereas Walter saw her more as a driven hard - boiled reporter than subservient homemaker .
Hildy has also come to tell Walter that she is taking the afternoon train to Albany , where she will be getting married tomorrow to staid straight - laced insurance agent , Bruce Baldwin , with whose mother they will live , at least for the first year .
Walter does n't want to lose Hildy , either as a reporter or a wife , and if he does , does n't believe Bruce is worthy of her .
Walter does whatever he can at least to delay Hildy and Bruce 's trip , long enough to persuade Hildy to stay for good .

Just returned home recently from my recent vacation ( and pigged out everywhere I went ) , and I think it did pretty well for my weight .
I 'm finally now over the 200 mark , but think I might go and gain even a bit more .
Here 's some recent pics of my progress .
( Fortune Small Business ) --
Talk about patient money .
It took The Female Health Company , a Chicago - based maker of female condoms , almost 20 years to turn a profit .
O.B. Parrish , the company 's 75 - year old CEO , is nothing if not persistent .
He retired from his position as head of G.D. Searle 's global pharmaceutical business in 1985 , when Searle 's then - president , Donald Rumsfeld , helped engineer the company 's sale to Monsanto ( MON , Fortune 500 ) .
With two other big pharma veterans , Mary Ann Leeper and William Gargiulo , Parrish began looking for health care companies to invest in .
He found a tiny Wisconsin firm that had licensed the right to make a female condom , using designs created by a Danish physician .
Parrish felt the device -- not yet off the drawing board -- could be marketed as a contraceptive , and later , as prevention against HIV / AIDS .
They bought a portion of the company and started developing the first - generation female condom , the FC1 .
( Eventually they would buy the entire business and change its name . )
But the very notion of a female condom had a rough road ahead .
To sell one would mean building a global market for it .
Bidia Deperthes is an HIV / AIDS technical advisor for the U.N Population Fund who has worked with 56 countries on their condom policies .
The hurdles were -- and to some extent , still are -- huge .
As she puts it : " It is a woman issue , and our policy makers all over the world are mainly men . "
Moreover , manufacturing an effective female condom at a reasonable price was an uphill battle .
Investor Stephen Dearholt , who owns about 17 % of the company , says it took years to develop equipment that could manufacture high - quality devices quickly .
In early days , he says , " We were making them by hand . "
In the first versions , welds in the thin polyurethane could hurt the woman .
Clearly , that flaw was unacceptable .
But as the understated Parrish says , " We are n't easily dissuaded . "
Profits were n't the only motive .
" One of the reasons we stuck with it and believe in it is , this product saves lives , " he says .
Gaining acceptance
And so they kept at it .
The team recruited Mike Pope , a British engineer , who developed a mass - production method , and the FDA approved the FC1 in 1993 .
Slowly , the company started selling to nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) , which distributed the condoms to women in developing countries .
But the first - generation condom had many problems , including slipperiness and noise during sex .
In 2007 , the New York Times quoted former Female Health ( FHCO ) staffer Mitchell Warren as saying it had a significant " yuck factor . "
The price was extraordinarily high -- at one point , up to $ 1.20 a piece , in contrast to male condoms , which sell for pennies .
And there are more daunting problems .
Without programs to teach women how to use them and to negotiate for their use with unwilling male partners , women do n't adopt female condoms , says Bidia Deperthe .
In African countries , when a woman suggests condom use -- either version , for the female or the male -- her husband often assumes she 's being promiscuous .
" For us to be successful , you have to put the money into programming , " Deperthe says .
But Parrish and his partners kept steadily chipping away at the obstacles under their control , starting with the product 's quality and price .
Casting about for a cheaper material , they settled on a soft synthetic latex and developed a new manufacturing process that could spit out millions of the devices every year .
That breakthrough led to condoms that cost about two - thirds of the original price and give Female Health a substantially higher margin .
In 2006 , the World Health Organization approved FC2 , allowing U.N. agencies to buy it in bulk for distribution overseas .
That year , Female Health finally turned its first profit .
But without FDA approval , Female Health could n't sell FC2 to U.S. groups like the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , one of the largest global organizations working to prevent HIV / AIDS .
( In the meantime , USAID was distributing small quantities of the FC1 . )
This March , the FDA approved the FC2 .
The UNFPA 's Deperthe is overjoyed .
With all public health organizations -- especially USAID -- now able to buy the same condom , volume will rise , meaning prices could drop as low as 30 cents each .
Deperthe hopes that public donors will be able to distribute 50 million female condoms this year .
Political forces , too , are going their way .
In 2008 , President Bush authorized $ 48 billion in AIDS prevention and treatment funding assistance over five years .
And U.S. public health programs have discovered the female condom -- most notably , the New York City health department , which distributed 2 million female condoms last year .
All of this added up to a great 2008 for Female Health .
It distributed 34.7 million units , up 34 % from 2007 , in 93 countries .
Revenues jumped 33 % to $ 25.6 million , while net income grew 215 % to $ 4.8 million .
This year looks good as well .
With the only FDA - approved condoms on the market , the company has no significant competition -- yet .
Notably , a Seattle nonprofit called PATH , backed by the Bill Gates Foundation , has developed a new product , but has not yet run it through the expensive clinical trials needed for FDA approval .
This year , Female Health will plow a few million dollars into expanding its manufacturing plant in Malaysia .
Still , the company expects to have such significant cash flow that it's a " cash cow , " says hedge fund manager David Sandberg of Red Oak Partners , one of Female Health 's investors .
Despite its newfound success , Female Health has only made tiny inroads into the market .
In 2007 , more than 11 billion male condoms were delivered around the world , in contrast to 27 million female ones .
" This is an imbalance that has to change , because the population is one man , one woman .
And women are disproportionately affected by HIV , " says Deperthes .
To her , that imbalance is an outrage .
To Parrish , it is that as well -- and an incredible market opportunity .
" We have almost unlimited need for the prevention of AIDS , " he says .
And so Parrish and his colleagues will keep on moving forward , one persistent step at a time .

It 's been a long time coming but it is looking like any day now we might start the Al Franken Decade ( well , Senate terms are actually only six years ) .
Franken is the Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labour Party Candidate ( there is no simply " Democratic Party " in Minnesota ) and he took on former Democrat , now Republican , Norm Coleman in what is now Minnesota 's longest ever election .
The vote was close between a former comedian and a former Democrat who has had his fair share of scandal problems , including one right now .
But hey , this is Minnesota , they elected a wrestler to be Governor .
After the votes were counted in November Franken trailed Coleman by only 215 votes .
Coleman said that Franken should save the taxpayers money and concede , but Franken went forward with a re-count and came on top .
Who could have predicted that Coleman would then challenge this re-count ?
Now this protracted struggle might almost be over with the Minnesota Supreme Court ruling expected any day .
Or not .
Coleman may have the legal right to appeal federally or the Governor could not sign off on the election .
It depends how much the Republicans want to drag this out , and dragging it out has been a key issue for them for months .
Why ?
Two main reasons .
The first is if Franken wins he becomes the 58th Democrat ( there are two independents that tend to vote Democratic ) which in theory means that the Democrats can stop a Republican fillibuster .
The Republicans have been able to stall appointments and cause other headaches for the Democrats because of the fillibuster threat .
However , you get many votes that do n't go on party lines and getting 6o votes can be tough .
But without Franken it is extremely difficult .
The second reason is that Franken would represent , relatively speaking for the U.S. Senate , a pretty progressive vote .
He was endorsed by ACORN , and NARAL , and the DFL Feminist Caucus and supports unions and specifically the Employee Free Choice
Act which helps workers form unions ; he wants the troops home , and he supports single payer which implies he supports the public option for health care on the table right now .
To bad he is n't around to vote .
And you can thank not just Norm Coleman for that but really the Republican machine that pumps money into Coleman 's coffers .
They really do n't want this guy to be in the Senate .
In fact , Senator John Cornyn ( R - TX ) , Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee said it could take " years " for the appeals to be finished .
But the court may say otherwise and Coleman just got dinged to pay some of Franken 's bills , though if they can get a rare recount you can be their bottom dollar big bucks will flow on both sides .
We will know soon enough .
The state canvassing board certfied Franken as the winner and now the court will let us know soon , but it is not looking great for Coleman .
Al Franken for Senate ?
Let the Decade begin .
Achieving ones goals will depend on celebrating the successes you have on your journey .
Nobody likes to continue working on something when there are only defeats .
It ’s the successes that spur us on to achieve greater heights .
It ’s therefore really important when working towards a goal to keep track of your successes .
The best way to do this is to write them down , or journal those in a file on your computer or even better write about them on a blog .
There is also great project management software available online that allows you to keep accurate track of what ’s happening on your journey towards your goals .
Many of these are free if you use the basic entry level option .
Keeping such an accurate track of your successes makes you appreciate your achievements .
It allows you to pat yourself on the back and to encourage yourself to achieve even more .
It also provides you with a history of your activities which will allow you to reflect in future years on the steps that you took to reach your goals .
Set up your journal to show the day and date and then compile a list of activities that you completed during the day .
If your goal is to lose weight you might want to fill in the first block of your journal with the point that your scale showed you had lost some weight .
Read
That would make you feel good about yourself .
To achieve further progress you might consider a personal trainer at the gym just to give yourself a bit more momentum in the exercise regime or you could work on the next day ’s menu with nutritious fruit and veg to fill the whole day with so as not to need to grab that packet of crisps because you are hungry .
Looking at your success journal will allow you to work out the best experiences for the next day .
It makes it clear in your mind what worked for you and what you need to do more of to continue your successes .
Leaving your weight loss program to chance will lead you to miss reaching your goal .
Add to this powerful exercise by visualizing your next day and how it could be absolutely perfect for you .
Imagine the day as you would like it to happen .
You see yourself complete your work quickly so that you have time to enjoy your day at the gym and even add a quick swim to your exercise regime and maybe extend those precious minutes in the sauna .
You see yourself having time to really enjoy that healthy salad you have planned for lunch instead of having to resort to grabbing a quick hot dog to fill that hole in the stomach .
You see your day run smoothly and efficiently with many friendly and helpful people making it a pleasurable experience .
With such a wonderful day you will feel that you can go home happily and that you wo n’t need to relax with that bottle of wine that you know will pile on the pounds faster than you can exercise them off .
You have had such a great day you just know your body is loving you and your scale will show the effect by dipping further .
Visualizing your ideal day will help you create it .
By doing this at night just before you go to sleep your subconscious mind will have the opportunity of working on it for you and helping you make it a reality .

Advertisement Video - sharing website YouTube has removed hundreds of pornographic videos which were uploaded in what is believed to be a planned attack .
The material was uploaded under names of famous teenage celebrities such as Hannah Montana and Jonas Brothers .
Many started with footage of children 's videos before groups of adults performing graphic sex acts appeared on screen .
YouTube owner Google said it was aware and addressing the problem .
Disturbing videos
The BBC was made aware that scores of sexually explicit and inappropriate material was uploaded .
In one video titled Jonas Brother Live On Stage , a user posted a comment saying : " I 'm 12 years old and what is this ? "
This kind of raid showed how easy it is to upload porn to a website that millions of people browse on a daily basis
" Flonty " Under other uploaded videos , online users posted comments such as : " Take the tags off , you 'll get us caught . "
Another said : " Your gonna kill us all ! "
As the disturbing videos were being uploaded , many viewers added them to their favourites and rated them highly .
One user believed to have uploaded some of the pornographic material videos is Flonty , whose profile states that he is 21 and from Germany .
He told the BBC : " I did it because YouTube keeps deleting music .
It was part of a 4 Chan raid . "
4 Chan is a bulletin board focusing on Japanese manga and anime but some of its more extreme sections have been described on online messageboards as " sick " and " horrifying stuff " .
" Anything and everything can , and usually does , happen here .
We have our very own unique culture , and there is no group quite like us anywhere out there " .
Community guidelines
When asked if he was concerned that children can freely watch such inappropriate material on YouTube , Flonty replied : " Children will find inappropriate material around the internet anyway .
" This kind of raid showed how easy it is to upload porn to a website that millions of people browse on a daily basis " .
Google spokesman Scott Rubin told BBC
News : " We are aware of the slew of pornographic videos that were uploaded .
" We are addressing them as we would any video that violates our community guidelines .
" In addition , any account we discover that has been set up specifically to attack YouTube will be disabled . "
Your comments :
YouTube delete music because they have to by law .
Half the time you 'll end up with a same copy of that same song elsewhere on YouTube anyway , and even then there are other sources for music .
Children DON'T JUST find porn that easily .
What about people at work who have a legitimate reason for using YouTube ?
How would one go about explaining porn to their boss ?
Tony Williams , Liverpool YouTube is a privately owned site .
Why do people feel entitled to use the site as they please ?
Do they help pay for bandwidth ?
Google ultimately has governance of what content should be on a site that they own .
In most parts of the world , anyone is free to set up their own personal website with streaming content for their cause .
Let 's just see how many views is generated beyond their own interest group .
Sophie , Toronto , Canada
A lot of comments here seem to excuse this behaviour because " kids need to learn how they get here " .
As if parents should take this mindlessness as an opportunity to educate their children on sex and procreation .
RB , Florida Flonty - you may have shown how easy it is to upload this material .
It 's also easy to hit people with a car , but that does n't mean you do it .
The anonymity of the internet helps cowards .
Martin Holloway , London , UK People who think this is " amusing " or " to be expected " simply do n't get the point of this - yes , our little children may have the ABILITY to look up these pornographic images thanks to the Internet 's wide selection , but these people simply took away the CHOICE that these kids would have to look up the aforementioned items .
I mean , think of what would have happened if you were a pre-teen or younger , and you found this video of your favourite recording artists performing a song you enjoy , and suddenly it cuts to the image of a lot of men demeaning and performing degrading acts on a female who is paid to perform as though she is enjoying it .
You think YOU could understand what 's going on ?
Plain and simple , the service providers should be given the information of the people who did these and suspend if not ban these people from the internet .
David , San Antonio , USA
Better stop taking your kids to the zoo then .
How are you going to explain why the Big Elephant is trying to jump on the Little Elephants back , if you can't explain your own species procreation .
Ben Heap , Keighley , West Yorkshire Mark from South Shields - explain to your seven - year - old that some louts uploaded some naughty clips onto YouTube that are only for grown - ups to see .
Or if you 're feeling particularly adventurous , pat him on the back and say : " That 's how you got here , son . "
Not so difficult .
I seriously doubt that kids are going to be traumatised by having witnessed adult humans in the act of mating , nor by any education from their parents they receive in light of such an event .
Heather , Glasgow , Scotland Welcome to the 21st century .
I am hoping that within the next few years enough people will have been exposed to the full diversity of sexuality via the internet that we can finally have some intelligent public discourse that acknowledges its existence rather than perpetually trying to suppress such information .
All people , children included , should have access to such information and be allowed to make their own decisions and come to their own conclusions about it .
Though the YouTube raid is rather childish , it will force some parents to acknowledge and explain things to their children that they would rather pretend do n't exist .
Jona Andersson , Sweden
The problem is that the hackers intentionally tagged the videos under misleading names .
So it seems to me that their intent was to get children to look at pornographic materials .
The issue is more than just porn on YouTube .
I 'm all for freedom of expression and allowing people to upload whatever they want , but I 'm not for dishonesty .
And in this overtly sexual world , it gets hard for parents to trust the internet even though its becoming close to impossible to live without it .
True , there 's porn on millions of sites which children could easily have access to , but there is a significant difference between that and interest groups purposely tricking and delivering porn to children in a Hannah Montana package on YouTube .
Tiya , Miami , Fl I understand their motives .
I 'm sick and tired of clicking on videos on YouTube only to be told it 's been removed due to copyright .
These ridiculous copyright laws are completely ridiculous and I know there are many who agree .
Is n't it better that we listen / watch things on YouTube rather than not at all ?
Like I said , I understand the motive , but i think there could have been a more constructive way of getting the point across .
Shaun , Glasgow , Scotland
What a bunch of utter losers , thinking that was a clever trick to raise awareness of ' issues ' .
Those videos could really seriously disturb some kids .
Dan , United Kingdom
This type of thing is rampant on the internet , and should not be allowed .
The only solution is stricter government controls on the content of the internet , and harsher punishments for those who violate those controls .
Everyone involved in this hacking attack should receive no less than 25 years in prison , and should have to register as sex offenders .
Richard C. Mongler , London , UK Flonty says " Children will find inappropriate material around the internet anyway . "
The difference being is that those kids will activly be looking for porn , not having it forced into their faces by this sad little man .
Christine , Derby - UK " Moderate all the uploaded videos ?
Are you insane ? " said Michael , he 's right because latest reports from a few days ago indicate 20 hours of video are uploaded every second .
The only solution is to charge users for uploading content , while watching remains free .
Ian Mayman , UK
So if kids can't find porn on YouTube , where else could they find it ?
Oh , that 's right - on one of a thousand other tube - like sites that specifically cater to those who like the adult entertainment .
And most of these websites only require you to check a box confirming that you are of legal viewing age ( a claim that they 're not going to crosscheck anyway ) .
If you 're concerned about the purity of your kids , take away their computers .
Bentley Winston , Madison , WI , United States Welcome to the internet .
Nelson Mills , Los Angeles USA Moderate all the uploaded videos ?
Are you insane ?
Ask YouTube how many videos get up loaded a day ... and then think again .
Michael , Surrey , UK I let my kids watch YouTube under supervision , so how would I explain to my seven - year - old when a porno flick appears instead of the Jonas Brothers ?
The question is here that YouTube can be seen as a ' trusted site ' and when this trust is violated by a few hackers it spoils it for everyone else .
Mark , South Shields
Sites should either be child friendly or not I think the concept of being a portal for the interests of both children and adults is unrealistic and impossible to monitor when images , audio , and video or concerned .
James , Houston , US
It 's bad that such material was uploaded to target children , but let 's remember what YouTube is all about , allowing people to upload videos , and to share them with the rest of the world and to do it free of charge .
Now this second characteristic I believe will make it close to impossible for YouTube to have trained people sit down and scan every video uploaded .
If you are concerned about your kids watching such stuff , please take the pain to protect them .
Saba Mahmud , HE , IL For those who wanted to protest the loss of music from Google , it does n't seem very inventive to upload porn to YouTube .
If they really wanted to make a more distinguished protest , they could have plainly made a video of their own and uploaded it instead of acting cowardly as they have .
Kelly , Crofton , BC , Canada
I think mass censorship and administration of YouTube is not a possible solution .
It 's the internet after all and things like this are bound to happen .
I think too many things are being done to stop children from seeing things that they are bound to see one day or another .
Mike , Wrexham I am not overly worried about pornographic clips .
What I am worried about is that no one is concerned about all the violence everywhere on the internet .
And this violence is treated as the most normal thing in the world .
I rather have kids watch porn than violence .
Johannes , Netherlands Children are exposed to scenes of horrible violence in the media every day , as well as advertising designed to affect them on a psychological level .
This is acceptable .
But show them any kind of pornographic image and suddenly they are victims .
Derek ,
Taiwan
I think any material uploaded a website aimed at people of all ages should assessed by an administrator before being publicly displayed .
Simple as that .
Kirsty , Lichfield , UK Pre-moderating uploaded videos is not a viable option for a site as huge as youtube .
Any video that is inappropriate will be flagged by the community and removed .
Videos can be removed faster than they can be created / uploaded , so they should n't really worry too much about it .
John , Lancaster , UK I find these attacks very disgraceful , as much as they want to protest against Google removing music , it does in no way warrant an attack using pornography .
In fact I would n't say it was an protest against the music but a method to please the people uploading this filth .
Carl Davidson , Carlisle , Cumbria I am not surprised at what happened .
I cannot turn a page in a magazine , watch a television program , listen to the radio or any other means of media where I am not assaulted by sexuality being the forefront to sell whatever it is the advertiser is wanting to sell and paying the media enough money to run it .
Then we complain when society portrays just that .
Marie , Canada
Not particularly surprised , and am partially amused , that this happened .
Granted , I do n't relish the idea of pre-teens being exposed to pornography , but it is a laugh .
And for every parent who screams bloody murder at their precious little ones seeing that sort of material , a piece of advise - do as my father did , and a ) monitor where your children go on the internet and b ) have a relationship in which they 'll respect you enough not to go looking for such things , and will turn away when they see it .
Not nearly as difficult as one would think .
Valentia , Baltimore , USA
Yes , there should be greater restrictions to upload a video on such sites .
Otherwise , one can upload anything as we can see .
Sajib , Dhaka , Bangladesh .
This could be a serious problem - not because of the idea that children could see this material but because it's a rare occurrence which could cause catastrophic results : censorship .
And serious censorship at that - with people using this incident as an excuse to begin censoring video's not suitable for children .
Youtube is a fantastic medium that self - censors amazingly well - what , I hope , people understand is that this is one situation and a minority out of the majority of users that post non-pornographic content and follow the rules .

That ’s No Way To Steal An Election
Like all of you , I ’m wondering what ’s going on in Iran .
Here ’s a question I have n’t seen addressed ( because it ’s premature , that ’s why , but I ’ll ask it anyway ) : assuming that the election was stolen , why did n’t those responsible do a more competent job of covering up the evidence ?
Why the 11th hour scramble ?
If the election was stolen in this apparently crude , last - minute way , it would appear that the regime was in substantial denial about what was about to happen ; which says something .
Or it was unable to coordinate a large scale conspiracy to rig the election smoothly , further in advance , presumably for fear that some who were brought into the effort would betray it .
That would say something , too .
Here ’s a question that maybe people can answer : what ’s the history of rigged elections ?
Are they mostly rigged well in advance , or do those in power do something crude and last - minute when they realize , to their surprise , that they are actually in danger of losing ?
This article is a deliberate meta - troll .
To be successful I need your trolling cooperation .
Now hear me out .
In The Strangest Thing An AI Could Tell You Eliezer talks about asognostics , who have one of their arm paralyzed , and what 's most interesting are in absolute denial of this - in spite of overwhelming evidence that their arm is paralyzed they will just come with new and new rationalizations proving it 's not .
Does n't it sound like someone else we know ?
Yes , religious people !
In spite of heaps of empirical evidence against existence of their particular flavour of the supernatural , internal inconsistency of their beliefs , and perfectly plausible alternative explanations being well known , something between 90 % and 98 % of humans believe in the supernatural world , and is in a state of absolute denial not too dissimilar to one of asognostics .
Perhaps as many as billions of people in history have even been willing to die for their absurd beliefs .
We are mostly atheists here - we happen not to share this particular delusion .
But please consider an outside view for a moment - how likely is it that unlike almost everyone else we do n't have any other such delusions , for which we 're in absolute denial of truth in spite of mounting heaps of evidence ?
If the delusion is of the kind that all of us share it , we wo n't be able to find it without building an AI .
We might have some of those - it's not too unlikely as we 're a small and self - selected group .
What I want you to do is try to trigger absolute denial macro in your fellow rationalists !
Is there anything that you consider proven beyond any possibility of doubt by both empirical evidence and pure logic , and yet saying it triggers automatic stream of rationalizations in other people ?
Yes , I pretty much ask you to troll , but it 's a good kind of trolling , and I can not think of any other way to find our delusions .
BlackBerry and iPhone users might argue endlessly about which keyboard is better , but a new prototype display could bridge their divide :
It combines touchscreen technology with physical buttons that appear or disappear , depending on the application .
Two doctoral students at the Carnegie Mellon University have developed a screen with three functions : pop-up buttons and keypads can appear and disappear , the user can touch input and the screen can render graphics .
" It is rare to be able to do all three in a single display , " says Chris Harrison , a Ph.D. researcher at the Human Computer Interaction lab at CMU .
Harrison , along with Scott Hudson , published a paper last month explaining how the displays would work .
" It is tough to create a physically deformable surface that can still do graphics pretty well , " he says .
It is a " thought provoking " project that plays into the emerging field of dynamic tactile displays , says Johnny Lee , a researcher at Microsoft 's Applied Sciences Group , who read Harrison 's paper early on but otherwise not connected with the research .
" It ’s a really , really interesting and stimulating idea , " he says .
" As humans we are very tactile individuals , " says Lee .
" Touch is our primary sense as we navigate the world but touchscreens do n't allow us to use it . "
Despite the popularity of touchscreens , many users still prefer physical buttons .
Physical buttons offer a low - attention way of interacting with display .
And they are especially useful in situations where users do n't want to completely concentrate on a task on the screen .
For instance , in cars , drivers have to take their eyes off the road to change the volume on a radio with a touchscreen .
Physical buttons , especially if they could change dynamically depending on task , would let the driver touch something and keep her eyes on the road , says Harrison .
Harrison 's research is sure to gnerate interest among companies ttrying to bring more tactile feedback to touchscreens .
Research
In Motion attempted to bring the physical feel of clicking on a keypad to its BlackBerry Storm touchscreen .
The move fell short of many users ' expectations .
But it has left the door open to other attempts that can more successfully mimic the sensation of hitting a real button on a multitouch display .
The latest prototype display uses rear projection for the visual display and infrared lighting and a camera setup behind the display for the multitouch input .
In its simplest form , the prototype involves creating an air chamber by layering several specially - cut pieces of clear acrylic .
A thin sheet of translucent latex is draped on top of this to act as a deformable projection surface .
The air chamber is then negatively or positively pressurized to create small pop-up buttons that mimic the feel of real physical ones .
" The tiny conduits of air actuate the display to create the different button options for users , " says Harrison .
Though the early prototype allowed it to work only in large installations , the researchers have been able to miniaturize it for screens as small as mobile phones .
But they still face some major limitations .
" Using pneumatic pumps to do the actuation is a little bit power consuming , " says Lee .
" That limits the environments it can be used in . "
The latex material also used in the displays can be damaged or punctured , especially with repeated use , says Lee .
But those roadblocks can be overcome with use of different materials and pressure mechanisms , he says .
" As a proof of concept the idea is very interesting , " says Lee .

Today ’s Programming Praxis problem is about Ternary search tries , which are basically hashmaps of strings to values , but which can be faster in some cases .
We have to implement the data structure and provide functions to find , insert , update and delete items and a function to convert the trie to a list .
In order to match the provided solution , we will test our code by putting all the words in the bible , as well as their frequencies , into a ternary trie .
Our target is 52 lines ( the size of the provided solution ) .
Let ’s go .
Our imports :
import Data .
Char import qualified Data .
List .
Key as K import Prelude hiding ( lookup )
The data structure has two small differences from the one in the provided solution : I use a Maybe instead of the bool + value approach , since it ’s more idiomatic Haskell , and the split is a list instead of a single type .
The reason for this is that it makes the ternary trie far more generic : the provided solution works only for strings , because in the insert function it uses the first ASCII character as a default .
By making the split a list , I can use an empty list as the default , which means I can also define a trie with e.g. lists of Int as the key .
This would not be possible with a single item , since there is no way to get a default value for an arbitrary type .
Another thing you might notice are the strictness annotations on the three branches of a node .
If you omit these ( as I initially did ) and try to cram the bible in a trie you ’re going to go through stack space like a hot knife through butter , which means the program will be terribly slow .
Note that in order to see the benefit you will have to compile the program : running it in ghci will still produce a stack overflow .
data TernaryTrie k v = Empty | Node { val :: Maybe v , split :: [ k ] , lb :: !( TernaryTrie k v ) , eb :: !( TernaryTrie k v ) , gb :: !( TernaryTrie k v ) }
For lookup we have two terminating cases ( an empty node is reached or the key is found ) .
The rest is just simple recursion .
lookup :: Ord k => [ k ] -> TernaryTrie k v ->
Maybe v lookup _ Empty = Nothing lookup [ ] t = val t lookup ( x : xs ) t = case compare [ x ] $ split t of GT -> lookup ( x : xs ) $ gb t LT -> lookup ( x : xs ) $ lb t EQ -> lookup xs $ eb t
Insert , update and delete all follow the same pattern .
To get rid of the boring ‘ take the correct action for each branch ’ code I factored that out into the modify function to better comply with the DRY principle .
insert :: Ord k => [ k ] -> v -> TernaryTrie k v ->
TernaryTrie k v insert k v Empty = insert k v $ Node Nothing ( take 1 k ) Empty Empty Empty insert [ ] v t = t { val =
Just v } insert k v t = modify ( flip insert v ) k t update :: Ord k => [ k ] -> v -> ( v -> v ) -> TernaryTrie k v ->
TernaryTrie k v update k v _ Empty = insert k v Empty update [ ] v p t = t { val = Just .
maybe v p $ val t } update k v p t = modify ( \x -> update x v p ) k t delete :: Ord k => [ k ] -> TernaryTrie k v ->
TernaryTrie k v delete _ Empty = Empty delete [ ] t = t { val =
Nothing } delete k t = modify delete k t modify :: Ord k => ( [ k ] -> TernaryTrie k v -> TernaryTrie k v ) -> [ k ] -> TernaryTrie k v ->
TernaryTrie k v modify f k t = case compare ( take 1 k ) ( split t ) of LT -> t { lb = f ( drop 0 k ) $ lb t } EQ -> t { eb = f ( drop 1 k ) $ eb t } GT -> t { gb = f ( drop 0 k ) $ gb t }
And more recursion for the enlist method .
enlist :: TernaryTrie k v -> [ ( [ k ] , v ) ] enlist = enlist ' [ ] where enlist ' _ Empty = [ ] enlist ' k t = maybe [ ] ( \v -> [ ( k , v ) ] ) ( val t ) ++ enlist ' k ( lb t ) ++ enlist ' ( k ++ split t ) ( eb t ) ++ enlist ' k ( gb t )
And we test it by finding the 25 most common words in the bible .
main :: IO ( ) main = print .
take 25 . reverse .
K . sort snd .
enlist .
foldl ( \t k -> update k 1 succ t ) Empty . map ( map toLower .
filter is Alpha ) . words =<< readFile " bible.txt "
And there we go .
With 35 lines it ’s not a huge reduction ( although the provided solution grows by about 15 lines if you reformat it to the 65 - ish character limit I use on this blog ) , but that was to be expected since it ’s mostly basic recursion , which does n’t easily lend itself to alternative solutions .
Still , it ’ll do .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The influential American Medical Association on Thursday said it supported the healthcare overhaul legislation moving through committees in the Democratic - led House of Representatives and urged its approval .
“ This legislation includes a broad range of provisions that are key to effective , comprehensive health system reform , ” AMA executive vice president Michael Maves wrote to the House committee leaders .
In particular , he said , the doctors ’ group backs the insurance market reforms that seek to expand healthcare coverage and the proposed health insurance exchange .
In this exchange consumers would choose between private insurers and a public plan .
He also cited the ban on exclusion from coverage for pre-existing conditions and an increased reliance on primary care doctors .
On federal healthcare programs , the AMA said it welcomed the changes in Medicare health care for the elderly which would include a repeal of the sustainable growth rate formula and the expansion of Medicaid for the poor .
“ This year , the AMA wants the debate in Washington to conclude with real , long overdue results that will improve the health of America ’s patients , ” he wrote .
SAN FRANCISCO 
When the district attorney in suburban Contra Costa County , Robert J. Kochly , announced last month that he would stop prosecuting certain misdemeanors for lack of money , the resulting outcry was enough to make him cut his own salary to avoid putting the plan in place .
But Mr. Kochly  who agreed to a 10 percent pay cut  is not the only local prosecutor who has floated extreme solutions in a time of dwindling budgets and increased caseloads .
District attorneys in many parts of the country say they are considering prosecutorial rollbacks , including opting not to try some minor crimes , eliminating crime prevention and monitoring programs , and seeking to divert more defendants to so - called community court systems .
The reason : not enough money to pay lawyers to try all those crimes .
“ Understaffing is always a problem , and when you talk about cutbacks on top of that it just compounds the problem , ” said Christopher D. Chiles , the prosecuting attorney in Cabell County , W.Va. , and the president - elect of the National District Attorneys Association .
The U.S. economy is n't likely to recover until " well into 2010 , " Wilbur Ross , chairman and CEO of WL Ross & Co. , said Monday .
" The consumer still has not been rehabilitated " and that 's the big problem halting the return to growth , given that the consumer used to be almost 70 percent of the U.S. economy , Ross told " Squawk Box . "
It 's doubtful that the government 's stimulus package will boost growth anytime soon and called for the White House to the renew the Term - Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) program as it expires in coming months .
" I do n't see how we can do without it , " Ross said .
The recent increase in the savings rate was a positive for the long term , but for the economy in the near term it was problematic as the consumer is cutting spending on products which may help with the economy 's healing , he said .
Jason Becker : The Amazing Musician with ALS Who Composes with His Eyes
By the age of 20 , Jason Becker was already a guitar legend — but after being diagnosed with ALS , he lost his mobility and was told he would have just several years to live .
20 years after that awful diagnosis , this inspiring man is still going strong and creating beautiful music .
At the age of 20 , Jason Becker was the envy of every rock guitarist in the world .
Though barely out of his teens , the young musician had already been performing to huge crowds for four years , and had gained worldwide acclaim for his unique shredding style .
At concerts , he showed off his skills by playing a guitar solo with one hand while yo - yoing with the other .
The fans ate it up .
Becker was such a promising young talent that he caught the eye of singer David Lee Roth , who invited Becker to join his band in 1989 .
Becker ’s contributions helped Roth ’s album , A Little Ain’t Enough , achieve gold record status .
Becker was planning to go on tour with Roth after the album ’s release , and partake in all the typical rock star indulgences — but life had other plans for him .
During the album ’s recording , Becker noticed something strange going on with his body .
He developed a “ lazy limp ” in one of his legs , which soon progressed to his other leg and his arms , making it impossible for him to pull off his virtuoso guitar moves .
Though Becker managed to finish recording the album , he knew touring in his condition was out of the question .
While the rest of Roth ’s band drove off to begin the tour , Becker stayed at home with his family , who took him to endless doctors ’ examinations to find out what was causing his problems .
Becker soon learned that he had Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( Lou Gehrig ’s Disease ) , which causes the gradual degeneration of all motor functions .
Doctors told him he would have just three to five years left to live .
As the doctors had predicted , Becker ’s health soon got worse .
First , he lost all motor function in his legs , and had to begin using a wheelchair .
Not long after that , he lost the use of his arms as well .
Eventually , the disease robbed him of his ability to speak .
But despite the toll that ALS has taken on his body , Becker is still very much alive more than 20 years after his diagnosis — and , incredibly , he ’s still composing brilliant music for his fans .
Even though Becker is unable to hold a guitar or even talk , he has an active , fulfilling life .
He communicates with friends and family by blinking his eyes according to a communication chart that his father invented for him .
Though he needs a translator to verbalize his thoughts to people who do n’t know his blinking system , Becker is able to hold conversations and joke around — as well as create innovative new music pieces that are even better than his earlier work .
For Becker , writing a song is a little bit more complicated than experimenting on his guitar and writing down the tablature .
“ I have the program called LogicPro and thousands of sound samples , ” he told Guitar World in a recent interview .
“ I am with whoever is my caregiver at the time .
I tell them what tempo and sound I want ( I direct everything by spelling with my eyes using the communication system my father invented .
It is way faster than any computer could be ) .
Then I try to teach my caregiver the notes I want . ”
The process may be time - consuming , but the results are astonishing .
When Becker has finished writing a song , he hires a band to perform the piece for him .
Since becoming ill , he has released several albums that include rare outtakes from his early performing days , as well as some of his inspiring new music played by other musicians , including guitar legends like Joe Satriani and Steve Vai .
His newest album , Collection , was released in 2008 , and includes three beautiful instrumental songs that Becker has composed in recent years .
Now , Becker is hard at work writing an autobiography with the assistance of a translator .
But composing music will always be a part of his life as well .
For Becker , the creative impulse is “ part of what keeps me alive , ” he said .
Although Becker still has extremely limited motor function , he has long since surpassed his estimated death date , and plans to keep on going for many years to come .
His positive spirit , relationship with his friends and family , his spirituality , and his love of music all keep him from giving up on his life .
“ I guess I still have a point or a purpose for being here , ” he said .
“ I do n’t really know why , but I am grateful . ”
Becker knows that even though it ’s become far more difficult for him to express himself , he can still send messages through his music , and is determined to make a difference in the world .
“ Not being able to play guitar anymore has made me focus more on beautiful melodies and soul stirring stuff , ” he told Guitar World .
“ Now I want people to feel something so deep that they ca n’t help but reflect and make positive changes in themselves . ”

In 2001 , Ultimate Fighting Championship , the mixed martial arts circuit , was struggling .
The bouts were banned from most cable TV outlets and its finances were dismal .
But that did not stop Lorenzo Fertitta , a Las Vegas casino owner , and his brother Frank from making a deal to buy UFC for $ 2 million .
“ All of my consultants said I was out of my mind , that this would be a black eye , but I felt the term Ultimate Fighting had relevance because it introduced America to the sport , ” Lorenzo Fertitta told The Times .
Today , Fertitta , 40 , will celebrate the 100th UFC event , which long ago sold out at an 11,000 - seat arena at the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas , with its top tickets priced at $ 1,000 .
The pay - per - view telecast is $ 49.95 , and in a sign of UFC ’s international reach , 51 countries will air UFC 100 live , and another 24 nations will show the event on tape - delay , the company said .
Forbes magazine last year valued UFC at $ 1.1 billion , ranking both Fertittas among the world ’s 900 richest people .
“ It ’s the most valuable franchise in sports , ” Lorenzo Fertitta said .
“ We have a sport that transcends culture and audiences . ”

The current recession , though , has hit the Fertitta brothers ’ Station Casinos hard , with the gaming company nearing bankruptcy to deal with its big debt load .
Fertitta said the casinos ’ problems do not “ in any way , shape or form ” affect UFC .
There ’s no question , though , that mixed martial arts is threatening to surpass boxing as the country ’s most popular combat sport .
Seven of the last 10 top live - gate fights in Las Vegas have been UFC events .
Fertitta got his first taste of the sport in the late ‘ 90s when he crossed paths with a former high school classmate , Dana White , who managed some fighters for UFC circuit .
Fertitta was introduced to MMA fighters , took lessons at a local gym and quickly became “ addicted ” to the sport , he said .
MMA then was hyped as a “ no holds - barred ” contest , using boxing skills , jujitsu , wrestling and karate .
However , the lightly regulated sport prompted Arizona Sen .
John McCain to infamously call it “ human cockfighting ” after one fighter repeatedly head butted an unconscious foe .

But Fertitta , then a Nevada boxing regulator , was charmed by the toughness and charisma of MMA fighters and turned into a “ groupie , ” he said .
“ We ’d go fly out to some podunk town in Louisiana to see these guys fight . ”
He named White as UFC president , and they shrewdly grew the sport by accepting rule changes , including banning knees to the head of a downed opponent , to win states ’ approval .
UFC ’s popularity also surged with the hit reality TV series , “ The Ultimate Fighter , ” which Fertitta bankrolled , and catapulted UFC into the mainstream and made stars out of fighters Chuck Liddell , Randy Couture , Brock Lesnar and Tito Ortiz .
UFC also packaged adrenaline - pumping montages in its arenas and on the Internet to lure 20 - and 30 - year - old fans to mixed martial arts .
In 2006 , the Liddell - Ortiz UFC fight reportedly generated more than 1 million pay - per - view buys .
UFC controls about 90 % of the mixed martial arts business , puts on fights monthly and the sport is approved in 38 states , up from seven when the Fertittas bought it .
Richard Schaefer , chief executive of retired boxer Oscar De La Hoya ’s Golden Boy Promotions , has watched UFC grow .
“ As far as which is the bigger sport , why does it matter ?
They can coexist , ” Schaefer said .
“ We just set our pay - per - view record two years ago , and UFC was around then .
. .
To say they ’re the best franchise in sports . . .
I ’d rather own the New England Patriots or the Lakers or Manchester United or Golden Boy Promotions . ”

David Carter , a professor at the USC Marshall School of Business , has also studied UFC ’s rise .
“ Before they took over , the sport was wayward .
They ’ve been tactical -- very targeted and methodical -- in getting media coverage , marketing the sport effectively , with savvy lobbying . . . distributing international content , introducing video games . . the creative ways [ UFC ] delivers their content is something other leagues look at . ”
The Fertitta brothers were raised in Las Vegas by their father , also named Frank , who ascended from a card dealer to casino owner banking on the idea that locals would flock to a casino off the famed Strip .
Lorenzo got a master ’s degree at New York University in 1993 and then went to work at his father ’s Station Casinos as the company grew rapidly at the start of this decade , expanding with resorts such as Red Rock and Green Valley Ranch .
Sports were part of their life .
Lorenzo ’s father took him to Leon Spinks ’ upset over Muhammad Ali in 1978 .
He was hooked and recalls the thrill of watching heavyweight boxing champions Larry Holmes and Mike Tyson make ring entrances in their prime as music blared .
The kid was taking notes .
Then at 27 , Lorenzo became a Nevada State Athletic Commission member and was assigned to supervise boxing cards .
After Fertitta bought UFC , he hired Marc Ratner , former Nevada State Athletic Commission executive officer , as his point man on government relations .
“ A brilliant move , ” said Gary Shaw , a rival MMA promoter .

Fertitta says he seeks uniform MMA safety rules in all states .
Although a few fighters have suffered broken limbs in UFC fights , no one has died .
The Fertitta family has also spent heavily in campaign donations .
Public records show Fertitta family members contributed more than $ 460,000 to candidates , including to presidential candidates Hilary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani in New York -- where MMA remains prohibited by law -- and McCain .
Last year , Arizona approved MMA , and McCain discussed his opinion of the sport with ESPN : “ They ’ve cleaned it up . . . they ’re in compliance now with most of the things we ’ve approved of . ”
Clearly , Fertitta ’s cash was critical to the sport ’s growth .
Dozens of TV producers dismissed his offer to air the “ The Ultimate Fighter ” reality TV series , which followed fighters battling each other to win a six - figure UFC contract .
Advertisement
Advertisers initially blew off the project .
Then the 2005 fight between Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonnar was one of the sport ’s most compelling slugfests and drew 2.6 million viewers .
Fertitta said he and Viacom TV executives “ cut a long - term deal that night on the back of a napkin . ”
Liddell , who became a mega-UFC star , said : “ No way this happens without Lorenzo and his brother , going $ 40 million in the hole before it turned around . ”
As lucrative as MMA has become , there have been complaints by fighters , such as Ortiz and Couture , that the UFC could share more of its wealth and provide more blanket health coverage beyond fight - night insurance .
Unlike in boxing , in which promoters are obligated to disclose financial figures to a fighter and state commissions , MMA organizations can keep profits from pay - per - view sales private .
Fertitta says UFC is generous with incentive bonuses and routinely pays for whatever medical attention a fighter injured in training requests .
Advertisement
“ Quashing the competition as they ’ve done hurts the fighters , ” said Shaw , whose rival Elite Xtreme Combat organization folded last year .
“ The UFC gives its fighters whatever it wants , and there ’s no outcry because the only person who can do that is a fighter .
If he does , the next thing you know , he ’ll be on his way out . ”
Fertitta answers : “ If you ’re a champion , you ’re a multimillionaire .
If you ’re a contender , you ’re making hundreds of thousands . ”
Liddell said he has no complaints : “ Look at where [ UFC ] was .
I can remember fighting for $ 1,000 .
. . .
These guys marketed it right , got it sanctioned , and look what ’s happened . ”

YouTube has removed thousands of pornographic videos from its servers following a coordinated attack which succeeded in uploading a catalogue of inappropriate clips to the video - sharing site .
4 Chan , a bulletin board for Japanese manga content , has been blamed for the attack , which used the names of celebrities such as Hannah Montana to lure unsuspecting YouTube users to the porn videos .
YouTube 's owner , Google , said thousands of videos have been deleted , but some may remain accessible for some time while the company removes the content and associated thumbnail images .
One person said to have uploaded the videos to YouTube claimed to have been part of a coordinated attack by 4 Chan users .
" I did it because YouTube keeps deleting music .
It was part of a 4 Chan raid , " said YouTube user ' Flonty ' , speaking to the BBC .
Google said any YouTube account set up to attack the video - sharing site will be disabled .
However , tracking the content being uploading is a mammoth task .
YouTube said in a blog on Wednesday that 20 hours of video is now being uploaded every minute .
This has grown from 15 hours per minute in January 2009 , and six hours per minute two years ago .
This story , " YouTube Yanks Thousands of Porn Videos " was originally published by PC Advisor ( UK ) .
String theory might help us understand how mystery materials like high - temperature superconductors work ( Illustration : Samuele Bastianello ’ )
STRING theory : you love it or loathe it .
To some it represents our best hope for a route to a “ theory of everything ” ; others portray it as anything from a mathematically obtuse minefield to a quasi-religion that has precious little to do with science .
There might be a middle way .
String theory ’s mathematical tools were designed to unlock the most profound secrets of the cosmos , but they could have a far less esoteric purpose : to tease out the properties of some of the most complex yet useful types of material here on Earth .
Both string theorists and condensed matter physicists – those studying the properties of complex matter phases such as solids and liquids – are enthused by the development .
“ I am flabbergasted , ” says Jan Zaanen , a condensed matter theorist from the University of Leiden in the Netherlands .
“ The theory is calculating precisely what we are seeing in experiments . ”
If solid science does turn out to be the salvation of string theory , it would be the latest twist in a tangled history .
String theory was formulated in the late 1960s to explain certain features of the strong nuclear force , one of four fundamental forces of nature .
It holds that electrons , quarks and the like are not point - like particles but minuscule , curled - up , vibrating strings .
No sooner had this idea emerged , though , than it lost ground to particle physicists ’ “ standard model ” , which proved capable of describing not just the strong force but also the weak and electromagnetic forces – and did so far more intuitively through the interactions …
Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said Wednesday that about one - fourth of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , could be tried in U.S. courts -- a number lower than the Pentagon previously had estimated .
Under the Bush administration , the Defense Department projected it could try as many as 80 Guantanamo detainees before military commissions .
A fourth of the current population of 229 would be about 57 people .
The new estimate came during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing , when Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) asked Holder whether one - fourth of the detainees stand to be tried before military commissions or federal courts .
Holder replied : “ That might be about right . ”
“ I do n’t think we are going to have a very huge number ” brought to trial , Holder said .
Advertisement
Critics contend that some detainees that the Bush administration intended to put on trial were low - level functionaries or foot soldiers who should not be charged with war crimes .
And human rights groups and lawyers have maintained that the evidence against many others is deeply flawed .
In the absence of trials , the Obama administration could be faced with holding a number of accused terrorists on a long - term basis without trials .
“ The more guys you try , the less you have to militarily detain , ” said Charles Stimson , a scholar at the Heritage Foundation who handled detainee issues in the George W. Bush administration .
Advertisement
Holder cautioned that the administration did not know how many , if any , detainees would have to be held without trial .
But he said that attorneys have been working on plans for federal court reviews of findings that suspects must be held without trial .
The courts then would conduct periodic reviews .
Holder said the administration would “ work with ” Congress on long - term detention but did not say whether the administration would seek legislation .
Some administration officials believe that the law authorizing U.S. military force in Afghanistan provides for long - term detention without further congressional action .
Advertisement
On a related issue , the Senate on Wednesday passed a measure sponsored by Graham to ban the release of photographs of U.S. troops abusing detainees .
Such a ban had been approved by the Senate as part of a bill funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But faced with stiff opposition in the House , the ban was dropped from the final version of the war funding bill .
In protest , Graham threatened to block the war funding .
He backed down after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) assured him the Senate would vote on the proposed ban .

Mono from SVN is now able to use LLVM as a backend for code generation in addition to Mono 's built - in JIT compiler .
This allows Mono to benefit from all of the compiler optimizations done in LLVM .
For example the SciMark score goes from 482 to 610 .
This extra performance comes at a cost : it consumes more time and more memory to JIT compile using LLVM than using Mono 's built - in JIT , so it is not a solution for everyone .
Long running desktop applications like Banshee and Gnome - Do want to keep memory usage low and also would most likely not benefit from better code generation .
Our own tests show that ASP.
NET applications do not seem to benefit very much ( but web apps are inherently IO - bound ) .
But computationally intensive applications will definitely benefit from this .
Financial and scientific users will surely appreciate this performance boosthttp://www.mono-project.com/.
Taking it out for a spin
Note : the notes here are no longer relevant , these applied to Mono back in 2009 .
LLVM has now been integrated into Mono , follow the steps in http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_LLVM
instead
You need to install both LLVM and Mono from SVN .
Get and install LLVM like this :
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm $ cd llvm $ ./ configure -- prefix= / mono -- enable - optimized $ make && make install
Then get Mono , and you need to apply a tiny patch to configure .in .
$ wget https://tirania.org/tmp/m7a9da378.txt $ svn co svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/mcs $ svn co svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/mono
$ cd mono $ patch - p1 < m7a9da378.txt $ ./autogen.sh -- prefix= / mono -- enable - llvm=yes $ make && make install
Now you have an LLVM - powered Mono .
LLVM is not able to support some of the features that Mono needs , so in those cases the JIT compiler will still fall back to Mono 's JIT engine ( methods that contain try / catch clauses or methods that do interface calls ) .
This backend was written by Zoltan .

Italian police have made several mafia arrests in recent months
An Italian Mafia fugitive , listed as one of the country 's 30 most dangerous men , has been arrested in Venezuela , Italian police say .
Salvatore Miceli , on the run since 2001 , had been under surveillance for three days before he was seized by officers in the capital , Caracas .
He is suspected of being a link between Sicily 's Cosa Nostra , the ' Ndrangheta network and Colombian drug cartels .
Italy 's interior minister said his arrest was an " important operation " .
A police statement said : " The investigation has essentially confirmed Miceli 's primary role in the drug trafficking sector and his ability to build a close network of relations with various trans- national organised crime groups . "
High - profile arrests Italian police have inflicted a number of major blows on the Sicilian Mafia in recent years .
Arrests have included the man known as the " boss of bosses " Bernardo Provenzano in 2006 , followed by the arrest of his heir apparent Salvatore Lo Piccolo in 2007 .
Pasquale Condello , the boss of the ' Ndrangheta - which operates from Calabria in southern Italy and is considered even more powerful than the Sicilian Mafia - was arrested in February 2008 .
In more recent months a number of operations in Sicily and the mainland have led to the detention of dozens more members of the Mafia , and arrests of members of the Camorra - a separate group operating around Naples .
When Silvio Berlusconi was elected prime minister last year he promised to be more aggressive towards organised crime .
A few hundred troops were sent to the Naples area to help police .
It is hard to conclude that all this current activity against the various mafia amounts to a concerted attempt to break them , says the BBC's Duncan Kennedy in Rome .
But it does seem like an extremely productive period for the authorities , even if the mob in all its guises continues to evolve and survive , he adds .

What may be more important to realize is this : each day is a blank slate .
The moment we open our eyes and take our first breathe of the new day – our free will is back for keeps .
But it can be hard to remember that sometimes we are n’t robots .
Not every time we get up on Monday do we need to become mindless drones : take shower , brush teeth , get in car , pick up coffee , go to work , fill out papers , check watch for lunch break , fill out papers , thank God for lunch , fill out papers , fill out papers , get back in car , drive home , make dinner , watch Simpsons , turn on Mets game , go to bed .
Rinse and repeat , ad nauseam .
No , life is n’t all routine , but it can sure feel like it .
Humans naturally crave familiarity and security , but we also have a natural crave for spontaneity and change .
Life is all about finding that elusive balance between the two .
To keep life interesting , but not turn it to insanity .
I believe that one of the most healthy and truly alternative things we can do is nothing .
How much could one learn about their self if they just spent a day depriving themselves of their routine doings ?
No more doing – just being .
Just existing .
Just soaking in the fact that I am this living , conscious , and breathing conglomeration of matter .
It ’s so bizarre , yet we rarely give the time to embrace the center of our beings .
Just spend a full twenty - four hours doing as close to nothing as possible .
I do n’t even mean something as little as watching TV .
Just sit there .
Just lay in the sun .
Be the lump on the log .
Doing nothing – like most things that are rewarding – is incredibly difficult .
Beginners will find that doing nothing takes practice .
We fear nothing , become averse to it , think negatively about it and choose to believe that anything is always better than nothing .
What if we could become content and satisfied with “ nothing ? ”
Then we would n’t have to always cling to the always desperate notion of “ anything . ”
Do n’t shower .
Do n’t eat .
Do n’t even get out of bed if you do n’t have to .
Meditate on the self without the need for these “ necessary ” conditions .
You are still you – just a more dirty , maybe more hungry , and less - doing you .
But the self is there , and you begin to unravel the core .
The core is consciousness – the only condition necessary for being and experience .
It reveals the most basic truths to existence .
The ones that can only be observed through the eyes of one ’s own mind .
There is nothing to fear from doing nothing – it is the foundation of all actions .
This is from Pastor Anderson 's camcorder and additional footage of the DPS surveillance cam .
( music added from the source ) text from the source ; I told them I was a US citizen .
I told them I was on a business trip .
I told them I had no drugs or humans in the car .
That was n't enough .
They wanted to search the car , and I invoked my 4th amendment rights .
I DID NOT RESIST OR FIGHT BACK .
YET I WAS TAZERED REPEATEDLY AND SHOVED IN BROKEN GLASS REPEATEDLY !I was IN the United States !!!
I had crossed no international border !!!

PLATTSBURGH , N.Y . |
The world ’s longest undefended border :
It ’s a catchy yet increasingly imprecise term for the U.S. - Canada frontier , as authorities on both sides ratchet up efforts to curb bustling traffic in illegal drugs and guns .
The U.S. Border Patrol has tripled the number of agents along the 5,500 - mile stretch in recent years , with hundreds more soon to be deployed .
Unmanned U.S. surveillance aircraft are being tested for use over the frontier , and video surveillance towers are going up around Buffalo and Detroit .
Multi-agency , binational law enforcement teams operate in 15 regions from coast to coast .
The U.S. - Mexico border draws far more attention - and more American resources , as Mexican drug cartels fuel killings and corruption with massive trafficking operations .
Thousands of Mexican troops battle the cartels in a conflict that has killed more than 11,000 people since late 2006 .
By comparison , the scale of drug violence and trafficking in Canada is minuscule .
Yet the northern border , mostly out of the spotlight , presents its own challenges .
It is hard to monitor due to its length and geography and used by a diverse array of traffickers ranging from outlaw motorcycle gangs to Asian - run drug rings .
“ It ’s a long border , mostly very remote , very wooded , very sparsely populated , ” said James Burns , the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) special agent in charge of upstate New York .
“ It ’s easy to go from one side to the other without detection . ”
Canada supplies large quantities of marijuana to American users , including hundreds of thousands of pounds a year of lucrative , high - potency “ B.C. Bud ” from British Columbia .
Canada also has developed rapidly into a leading supplier of ecstasy - often laced with highly addictive methamphetamine - both for U.S. and overseas markets , as crime gangs operate factory - style superlabs .
The contraband arrives by helicopter , boat and float plane , in cattle trucks , hikers ’ backpacks and by snowmobile .
One favored smuggling passageway is the St. Regis / Akwesasne Mohawk Indian reservation straddling the St. Lawrence River along the New York - Canada border where tribal sovereignty limits access by Canadian and U.S. investigators .
Just this month , federal and state authorities in Plattsburgh , on the western shore of Lake Champlain , announced the dismantling of a purported billion - dollar marijuana smuggling ring that used the Mohawk land as a transit route into the United States .
“ Operation Iron Curtain ” resulted in charges against more than 45 people , from Quebec to Florida .
Over the past four years , the ring smuggled about $ 250 million worth of high - grade , hydroponic marijuana into the United States annually , authorities said .
“ It ’s easy to forget in these idyllic surroundings and friendly communities - and with our close relationship with our Canadian neighbors - that there are people so interested in lining their own pockets that they do n’t care what harm they cause others , ” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Grant Jaquith .
Even excluding the remote 1,500 - mile border with Alaska , the U.S. - Canada frontier covers 4,000 miles from the Atlantic to the Pacific , making it twice as long as the U.S. - Mexico border .
Yet as of last month , the Border Patrol had 1,550 agents deployed along the Canadian border , compared with 16,900 along the Mexican frontier .
The northern contingent is up from less than 500 agents in 2002 and will expand to more than 2,200 over the next year .
At last count , marijuana from Canada accounted for less than 3 percent of the pot seized near U.S. borders , with the bulk coming from Mexico .
But the DEA fears more will be coming from the north as marijuana - growing operations expand in eastern Canada .
Other trends also cause alarm .
Seizures of ecstasy being smuggled from Canada to the United States quintupled between 2004 and 2006 , from 1.1 million dosage units to 5.2 million .
Meanwhile , Canadian authorities reported that seizures of cocaine coming northward over the border had tripled .
The boom in Canadian ecstasy smuggling followed a cutback of the drug ’s production in Western Europe and is linked to the ability of crime groups to bring precursor chemicals from Asia into Canada for processing at gang - run labs .
The United Nations ’ drug czar , Antonio Maria Costa , last month urged Canada to emulate the United States and Mexico in cracking down on these precursors , such as over - the - counter cold medicine .
Inspector Doug Ellerker , an assistant director of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ’s drug branch , said the superlabs are a prime target of investigators .
“ Because of the money to be made , it ’s a real issue for us to deal with , ” he said .
“ We ’re seeing a turn toward the larger economic - based labs that can produce larger quantities . ”
Canada ’s gangs are a multi-ethnic mosaic : Quebec biker gangs led by French - Canadians , and Chinese - and Vietnamese - led gangs in several major cities .
One particular problem , Canadian police say , is extensive infiltration of the trucking industry by criminals whose families emigrated from India .
The National Drug Intelligence Center , in its 2009 report , estimates that Canada - based drug gangs were generating between $ 33 billion and $ 56 billion annually from overall drug sales in the United States , with much of the cash smuggled through the Mohawk territory .

Unrest spread in the Xinjiang capital , Urumqi , on Sunday Scores of people have died after a protest in China 's western region of Xinjiang turned violent .
Some internet and mobile phone services in the area have been blocked , preventing easy communication between people in Xinjiang and the outside world .
Despite these limitations , the BBC has received several accounts of the violence , which we have published below .
The BBC has not been able to verify the information they contain , due to the restricted means of communication .
Linuxleio , Urumqi I am a Han Chinese living in Urumqi city .
I witnessed yesterday 's violence - it was terrible !
I saw a group of Muslim people who had caught two women , hit them until they fell to the ground and then attacked them with knifes .
After I witnessed that , I just wanted to run away , to avoid being captured by them .
Even though there 's been some violence in Xinjiang for years , yesterday was the bloodiest and most horrible day I 've ever had
Linuxleio
That day I was going shopping .
I saw hundreds of Muslims assembled in one place .
They were looking in the crowd to identify anyone who is Han Chinese .
Then they would attack and kill innocent passers - by .
That 's the truth behind what they called a peaceful demonstration .
They were filled with animosity and hatred against anyone who is not Muslim and does not belong to them .
They fired at innocent people who were walking on the road , they fired at buildings until the police came .
After the police arrived and dispersed the crowds , I swear , there were more than 20 innocent people lying on the road .
Maybe some were dead , as there was blood around them .
It was a horrible day .
Even though there 's been some violence in Xinjiang for years , yesterday was the bloodiest and most horrible day I 've ever had .
Ankar Kasim , Vancouver , Canada I am a Uighur currently living in Vancouver , Canada .
My cousin , who is in Urumqi , witnessed the brutal oppression of the Uighur protests by the Chinese .
There was a heavy police presence in Xinjiang over the weekend The Chinese are censoring all the information and trying to cover up the truth .
They have blocked most mobile and internet services .
So me and my cousin communicated through MSN messenger .
My cousin wo n't be in Urumqi for too long because he is being pressured by the Chinese to leave the country .
From what he told me , the military oppression of the peaceful protest really is the largest since the Tiananmen crackdown .
The Chinese sent out soldiers with machine guns , police vehicles and tanks - yes , tanks !
The police fired indiscriminately on the peaceful protesters , and scores of people died as a result .
The Uighurs were angry over ethnic violence last month in the city of Shaoguan in southern Guangdong province , when Han Chinese beat and killed Uighur workers .
Uighur people are in a great need of help and we ask the international community to condemn China 's killing of innocent Uighurs , the assimilation of the Uighur people and the discrimination Uighur people suffer by the Chinese .
Uighurs have no freedom whatsoever , living under the strict , brutal rule of communist China .

Scottish actor David Tennant is heading back to school - he has signed on to play a villain in the sequel to St. Trinians .
The star has landed his first major role since quitting as the beloved Time Lord in iconic sci- fi show Dr Who last year .
He will play evil baddie Pomfrey in the latest installment of the franchise , set in a chaotic all - girls school in Britain .
He will be joined by Colin Firth and Rupert Everett , who both starred in the 2007 movie - alongside Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding
The 2007 remake , which kickstarted Bond girl Gemma Arterton 's career , was a surprise hit , raking in $ 22 million ( £ 15 million ) at the British box office .
Concerns that Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs still poses a risk are laughable , his lawyer said today .
A Parole Board panel which recommended the 79 - year - old 's early release said he had not undertaken risk - related work and did not regret his offending .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" In terms of his attitudes and risk areas there is little evidence beyond his increased age to suggest that , if he were able to return to his old criminal associates and lifestyle , the risk of involvement in further violent offending has reduced significantly , " the panel said .
A decision on the release of Biggs is expected within days after the case was passed to Justice Secretary Jack Straw .
Biggs , who is eligible for release on July 3 , is on the hospital wing of Norwich prison .
He is barely able to walk , is fed through a tube and is expected to be cared for following his release by Barnet Council and the local Primary Care Trust near where his son Michael lives in north London .
The Parole Board report says the risk Biggs poses " is manageable under the proposed risk management plan and consequently parole is recommended " .
Biggs 's lawyer , Giovanni di Stefano , who is currently in Iraq , said : " The only important factor is this : the Parole Board has recommended release - all else is frankly superfluous .
" Biggs still a risk ?
At 80 , ca n't walk , ca n't talk , ca n't go to the toilet , is fed with nasal gastric feed , in a wheelchair ?
" I will leave whether Biggs is still a risk regarding robbery , because that is what the Parole Board had to decide , frankly to common sense , and I can hear many laughing even way afar from Iraq - the laughter travels thousands of miles .
But I am obliged whatever to the decision to recommend parole . "
Farmer 's Markets are a terrific weekend activity .
Many shoppers rush to get there early in an attempt to score the best finds , but the best deals may come to those who sleep in .

According to Consumer Reports , sellers rarely want to lug their goods back to the farm , so if you catch them late , you 'll likely be able to score some great bargains .
And unlike flea markets , because the goods are n't unique , odds are the seller will have a lot of the same morning selections left over later in the day .

So now we know where Sergey Aleynikov , the former Goldman Sachs computer programmer arrested last week for stealing the enigmatic code that Goldman says could be used to manipulate markets , sent the code : a URL called xp - dev.com .
Serge told an FBI agent that he uploaded proprietary code on “ multiple occasions . ”
The place he sent the code looks like it is a site that allows programmers to track code as it gets duplicated and changed through subsequent versions .
From Bloomberg :
Xp - dev.com is registered to London resident Roopinder Singh , who describes himself on a blog linked to the site as a trading systems developer working in London ’s financial services industry .
The site offers “ subversion hosting , ” letting users track current and previous versions of programming code and other documents .
Singh told his customers in the blog yesterday that he ’d been contacted by “ local UK authorities , ” who had seized his hard drives to examine them and shut his service down for 45 hours , beginning on July 6 , two days after Aleynikov ’s arrest .
“ It turns out that some idiotic moron a user had uploaded data on to the service that he / she was not authorized to have , ” he said , crossing out the words “ some idiotic moron . ”
“ This is your basic intellectual property theft case here . ”
And here 's Bloomberg columnist Jonathan Weil on the Goldman " doomsday machine " ( via ZeroHedge ) .
The dumb money is fairly easy to spot .
It ’s the money that always shows up late to the party , wearing yesterday ’s fashions .
It watches TV and thinks the reality shows show reality it thinks Ben Bernanke is a great economist that the SEC protects investors from fraud and misrepresentation and that Tim Geithner makes sure the economy keeps running smoothly .
It ’s the dumb money that thinks you can correct a generation - long period of credit growth in 24 months with less than 10 % unemployment
Stocks have now been in a rally for three months .
The longer this goes on , of course , the dumber money gets .
People come to think the bounce is a permanent bull market .
Yesterday , not much happened .
Stocks held steady .
Oil too .
Gold fell $ 8 closing at $ 952 .
And the dollar rose to $ 1.39 per euro .
But while the dumb money has its eyes on the stock market , the smart money is watching the economy .
Unemployment has risen to 9.4 million in the United States .
Experts think the rate of job losses is slowing .
But month after month , more and more people are not collecting wages .
Instead , they ’re coming to rely on handouts from the government .
The press reports that one in every six Americans is now on some form of government life - support .
Same thing in the housing sector .
Robert Shiller says the housing slump has already knocked prices down 32 % and has a long way to go .
This alone guarantees a long period of adjustment .
Bad decisions — usually those with huge debt bombs attached — will blow up then they need to be cleaned up and then , after the destruction , comes the constructive rebuilding .
All that takes time years .
People whose houses are going down in price and whose incomes are falling do not buy more stuff .
Sales go down profits go down and dividends go down .
Why would investors buy stocks when earnings and dividends are falling ?
Good question .
Pull your shorts up , dear reader pull your shorts up .
House prices are still going down — but not as fast .
Still , big resets , defaults and foreclosures are still on the way — in prime and Alt - A mortgages .
Meanwhile , when companies do n’t sell they do n’t ship either .
The trucking industry says traffic is off 13 % from a year before — the biggest drop in 13 years .
Airplanes are carrying 21 % less cargo .
And the commercial airline industry says it is losing $ 9 billion this year .
As for shipping well , do n’t even bring it up .
Shipping has been in a catastrophic slump since last year — with cargo rates down 90 % .
Obvious conclusion :
 Every smart trader I know is massively short the stock market ,  says Jeff Clark .
The blogs are chattering about poor Lee Mozilo .
He ’s no Angelo , they say .
The SEC claims he told investors that all was well in his company , Countrywide , while he was dumping shares .
We do n’t know the details , so we would n’t rush to judgment .
But our guess is that the SEC is trying to recover its reputation by putting on a few show trials .
The SEC has a pack of watchdogs on the payroll .
But somehow thieves stole every decent part in the junkyard without a single one of these mutts bothering to bark .
Now , they ’re indignant and out for justice !
Tomorrowu2019s Gold : A ... Marc Faber Best Price : $ 4.91 Buy New $ 513.99 ( as of 07:35 EST - Details )
Did Mozilo do something wrong ?
We do n’t know .
But the question would never have come up if it had n’t been for the crisis in housing debt .
As long as housing was going up , everyone was happy with Countrywide ’s business model .
Yet did n’t everyone know that the mortgage finance business was a dangerous place to be at the end of a housing bubble ?
Did n’t the SEC know it , too ?
If we recall correctly , Mozilo said so himself
But the SEC watchdogs slept through the biggest heist in history .
And now the people who lost face and lost fortunes are eager to pin the blame on someone other than themselves .
But that ’s just part of the whole process of deleveraging .
That ’s how capitalism works .
People lose money then they lose jobs and houses and businesses go into chapter 11 and a few of their CEOs go to jail .
All that takes time .
And betting against deleveraging is probably not a smart thing to do .
Not until it ’s over which is not until the leverage built up in the bubble era has been removed .
And with total debt levels at 370 % of GDP and the government adding even more debt we ’re a long way from there .
But what do you do , dear reader ?
Buy Treasuries in anticipation of another crash in stocks ?
Or mortgage your house , long - term fixed - rate , in anticipation of fed - caused inflation ?
Ah , there ’s the tough question .
We know where the dumb money is but where ’s the smart money ?
Jeff Clark says it ’s short stocks .
But there ’s some very smart money that is betting that the government will turn this around .
They ’re putting their money on inflation or even hyperinflation .
Our old friend , Marc Faber , for example , says he is sure the United States is headed for hyperinflation .
If so , shorting stocks may not be such a shrewd move .
Stocks could soar too — as investors try to buy anything and everything that did n’t have dollar signs on it .
Mobs , Messiahs , and Ma ... Will Bonner , Lila Rajiva Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 8.01 ( as of 04:35 EST - Details )
You see , there are two ways to deleverage an economy .
The obvious way is the traditional , honest way — in which people actually try to pay their debts .
This causes the problems we see as falling asset prices , bankruptcies , joblessness and the other hallmarks of a Great Depression .
But the feds have their hearts set on preventing a depression .
And they ’re doing it the only way they can by the old u201 Chair of the dogu201D technique .
The economy suffers from too much debt — so they ’re going to give it more !
Much more .
The whole pooch !
The whole kennel !
Then , they round up every stray mongrel in town .
What happens when they run out of dogs ?
Well that ’s a discussion for another day .
We have had many laughs following the feds and their war against capitalism .
They ’re gambling an amount nearly equal to the entire U.S. GDP to try to prevent people from getting what they have coming .
In the process , they ’re almost certain to make a mess of things .
The smart money is betting that they fail to stop deleveraging .
But the very smart money is betting that they create a new , worse problem — inflation , maybe hyperinflation .
Inflation reduces the real value of debt but in a perverse and unpredictable way .
Debtors do n’t pay their bills ; savers pay them .
Inflation — like bailouts — rewards the least responsible players those who have gotten themselves heavily in debt and punishes those who have done the u201 Crightu201D thing .
As Germany saw in the ’ 20s , it de-stabilizes the whole society leading to extremely unwelcome outcomes .

US GDP by State
A look at the individual economic strength of the 50 states by GDP .
A federal jury on Friday concluded that a 25 - year - old college student must pay $ 675,000 – or $ 22,500 for each of the 30 songs he was found liable of infringing , Ben Sheffner reports from the courthouse .
After a week - long trial and nearly three hours of deliberations , the Massachusetts jury concluded that Joel Tenenbaum , a Boston University graduate student , should pay those damages to the Recording Industry Association of America for infringing its copyrights on Kazaa .
He was the nation 's second RIAA file sharing defendant to go before a jury .
In the only other case that reached a verdict , a Minnesota woman was ordered to pay $ 1.92 million for infringing 24 songs on the file sharing network Kazaa .
The judge in that case is weighing whether the verdict was unconstitutionally excessive .
The RIAA has issued about 30,000 lawsuits during its nearly 6 - year - old litigation campaign against file sharers .
Most have settled out of court for a few thousand dollars .
The record labels have said they are ending the campaign , and are now lobbying ISPs in a bid to disconnect repeat music file sharers
Under the Copyright Act , Tenenbaum faced as much as $ 150,000 in damages per track .
He testified Thursday and admitted he downloaded and shared music online .
He said he was " not surprised " by the verdict .
If it stands , he said , " I will be filing for bankruptcy . "
In a telephone interview , he said the RIAA originally requested to settle the case in 2005 for $ 3,000 .
" I think a lot of people have this idea , and me in particular , that the RIAA should not intimidate people into huge settlements , " he said .
He added that he would challenge U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner 's decision , on the eve of trial , to prohibit a so - called fair - use defense .
That would have allowed him to lobby the jury that the Copyright Act permitted the sharing and downloading of copyrighted songs online without the labels ' permission .
" We 're not going to let a $ 675,000 verdict sit without fighting , " Tenenbaum said .
The defendant 's lawyer was Charles Nesson , the Berkman Center For Internet & Society founder who was accused of pretrial shenanigans , including secretly recording court proceedings .
The RIAA apparently is a bigger adversary than the U.S. government .
Nesson , in 1971 , convinced a federal judge to dismiss espionage charges against Daniel Ellsberg , a former Rand Corporation official who leaked 7,000 pages of classified Vietnam War data to The New York Times .

The face of the first anatomically - modern human to live in Europe has been revealed .
It belonged to a man – or woman – who inhabited the ancient forests of the Carpathian Mountains in what is now Romania about 35,000 years ago .
The artist 's reconstruction – a face that could be male or female – is based on the partial skull and jawbone found in a cave where bears were known to hibernate .
The facial features indicate the close affinity of these early Europeans to their immediate African ancestors , although it was still not possible to determine the person 's sex .
Richard Neave , the forensic artist who reconstructed the facial features in this clay model , based his assessment on a careful measurement of the bone fragments and his long experience of how the soft tissues of the face are built around the bones of the skull .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The reconstruction was made for the forthcoming BBC 2 series The Incredible Human Journey which documents human origins and evolution , from our birthplace in Africa to the long migratory routes that led us to populate the most distant parts of the globe .
It is impossible from the bones to determine the skin colour of the individual , although scientists speculate it was probably darker than modern - day Europeans , reflecting a more recent African origin .
Mr Neave 's clay head of the " first modern European " now sits on the desk of Alice Roberts , the Bristol University anthropologist who will introduce the BBC series , which is scheduled for screening next Sunday evening on BBC 2 .
" It 's really quite bizarre .
I 'm a scientist and objective , but I look at that face and think ' Gosh , I 'm actually looking at the face of somebody from 40,000 years ago ' , and there 's something weirdly moving about that , " Dr Roberts told the Radio Times .
" Richard creates skulls of much more recent humans and he 's used to looking at differences between populations .
He said the skull does n't actually look European , or Asian , or African .
It looks like a mixture of all of them .
And you think , well , that 's probably what you 'd expect of someone who was among the earliest populations to come to Europe . "
Potholers discovered the lower jawbone of the first modern European in 2002 in Pestera cu Oase , the " cave with bones " , located in the south - western Carpathians .
The remaining fragments of skull were unearthed in 2003 .
Scientists have dated the bones using radiocarbon analysis to between 34,000 and 36,000 years ago when Europe was occupied by both Neanderthal man , who had lived in the region for tens of thousands of years , and anatomically - modern humans – Homo sapiens – who had recently arrived on a migratory route from Africa via the Middle East .
Although the skull shares many modern feature of human anatomy , it also displays more archaic traits , such as very large molar teeth , which led some scientists to speculate the skull may belong to a hybrid between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals – an idea discounted by other experts .
Erik Trinkaus , professor of anthropology at Washington University in Missouri , and one of the first specialists to study the bones in detail , said the jaw was the oldest , directly - dated modern human fossil .
" Taken together , the material is the first that securely documents what modern humans looked like when they spread into Europe , " he said .
Neanderthal man
* Lived in Europe for 300,000 years , surviving a number of ice ages before dying out 25,000 years ago .
No one is sure why .
Original fossil remains were found in 1856 in the Neander valley , near Dusseldorf , Germany .
Socially advanced but left no signs of art , decoration or jewellery .
But archaeologists have discovered a flute and have tested their toolmaking skills , suggesting a higher level of sophistication than first thought .
Homo sapiens
* Arrived in Europe some 35,000 years ago , competing with Neanderthal man for 10,000 years .
DNA studies suggest the two species did not interbreed .
First remains of Homo sapiens – modern humans – found in 1868 in a cave in the Dordogne , France , and known as Cro-Magnon man .
Left cave paintings at Chauvet , Lascaux and Altamira , suggesting a sudden development of art .
Practice API Design Matters
Leander Herzog
After more than 25 years as a software engineer , I still find myself underestimating the time it takes to complete a particular programming task .
Sometimes , the resulting schedule slip is caused by my own shortcomings : as I dig into a problem , I simply discover it is a lot more difficult than I initially thought , so the problem takes longer to solvesuch is life as a programmer .
Just as often I know exactly what I want to achieve and how to achieve it , but it still takes far longer than anticipated .
When that happens , it is usually because I am struggling with an application programming interface ( API ) that seems to do its level best to throw rocks in my path and make my life difficult .
What I find telling is that , even after 25 years of progress in software engineering , this still happens .
Worse , recent APIs implemented in modern programming languages make the same mistakes as their 20 - year - old counterparts written in C .
There seems to be something elusive about API design that , despite years of progress , we have yet to master .
Good APIs are hard .
We all recognize a good API when we get to use one .
Good APIs are a joy to use .
They work without friction and almost disappear from sight : the right call for a particular job is available at just the right time , can be found and memorized easily , is well documented , has an interface that is intuitive to use , and deals correctly with boundary conditions .
So , why are there so many bad APIs around ?
The prime reason is that , for every way to design an API correctly , there are usually dozens of ways to design it incorrectly .
Simply put , it is very easy to create a bad API and rather difficult to create a good one .
Even minor and quite innocent design flaws have a tendency to get magnified out of all proportion because APIs are provided once , but are called many times .
If a design flaw results in awkward or inefficient code , the resulting problems show up at every point the API is called .
In addition , separate design flaws that in isolation are minor can interact with each other in surprisingly damaging ways and quickly lead to a huge amount of collateral damage .
Bad APIs are easy .
Let me show you by example how seemingly innocuous design choices can have far - reaching ramifications .
This example , which I came across in my day - to - day work , nicely illustrates the consequences of bad design .
( Literally hundreds of similar examples can be found in virtually every platform ; my intent is not to single out .NET in particular . )
Figure 1 shows the interface to the .NET socket Select ( ) function in C# .
The call accepts three lists of sockets that are to be monitored : a list of sockets to check for readability , a list of sockets to check for writeability , and a list of sockets to check for errors .
A typical use of Select ( ) is in servers that accept incoming requests from multiple clients ; the server calls Select ( ) in a loop and , in each iteration of the loop , deals with whatever sockets are ready before calling Select ( ) again .
This loop looks something like the one shown in Figure 1 .
The first observation is that Select ( ) overwrites its arguments : the lists passed into the call are replaced with lists containing only those sockets that are ready .
As a rule , however , the set of sockets to be monitored rarely changes , and the most common case is that the server passes the same lists in each iteration .
Because Select ( ) overwrites its arguments , the caller must make a copy of each list before passing it to Select ( ) .
This is inconvenient and does not scale well : servers frequently need to monitor hundreds of sockets so , on each iteration , the code has to copy the lists before calling Select ( ) .
The cost of doing this is considerable .
A second observation is that , almost always , the list of sockets to monitor for errors is simply the union of the sockets to monitor for reading and writing .
( It is rare that the caller wants to monitor a socket only for error conditions , but not for readability or writeability . )
If a server monitors 100 sockets each for reading and writing , it ends up copying 300 list elements on each iteration : 100 each for the read , write , and error lists .
If the sockets monitored for reading are not the same as the ones monitored for writing , but overlap for some sockets , constructing the error list gets harder because of the need to avoid placing the same socket more than once on the error list ( or even more inefficient , if such duplicates are accepted ) .
Yet another observation is that Select ( ) accepts a time - out value in microseconds : if no socket becomes ready within the specified time - out , Select ( ) returns .
Note , however , that the function has a void return typethat is , it does not indicate on return whether any sockets are ready .
To determine whether any sockets are ready , the caller must test the length of all three lists ; no socket is ready only if all three lists have zero length .
If the caller happens to be interested in this case , it has to write a rather awkward test .
Worse , Select ( ) clobbers the caller 's arguments if it times out and no socket is ready : the caller needs to make a copy of the three lists on each iteration even if nothing happens !
The documentation for Select ( ) in .NET 1.1 states this about the timeout parameter : " The time to wait for a response , in microseconds . "
It offers no further explanation of the meaning of this parameter .
Of course , the question immediately arises , " How do I wait indefinitely ? "
Seeing that .
NET Select ( ) is just a thin wrapper around the underlying Win32 API , the caller is likely to assume that a negative time - out value indicates that Select ( ) should wait forever .
A quick experiment , however , confirms that any time - out value equal to or less than zero is taken to mean " return immediately if no socket is ready . "
( This problem has been fixed in the .NET 2.0 version of Select ( ) .)
To wait " forever , " the best thing the caller can do is pass Int.
MaxValue ( 2311 ) .
That turns out to be a little over 35 minutes , which is nowhere near " forever . "
Moreover , how should Select ( ) be used if a timeout is required that is not infinite , but longer than 35 minutes ?
When I first came across this problem , I thought , " Well , this is unfortunate , but not a big deal .
I 'll simply write a wrapper for Select ( ) that transparently restarts the call if it times out after 35 minutes .
Then I change all calls to Select ( ) in the code to call that wrapper instead . "
So , let 's take a look at creating this drop - in replacement , called doSelect ( ) , shown in Figure 2 .
The signature ( prototype ) of the call is the same as for the normal Select ( ) , but we want to ensure that negative time - out values cause it to wait forever and that it is possible to wait for more than 35 minutes .
Using a granularity of milliseconds for the time - out allows a time - out of a little more than 24 days , which I will assume is sufficient .
Note the terminating condition of the do - loop in the code in Figure 2 : it is necessary to check the length of all three lists because Select ( ) does not indicate whether it returned because of a time - out or because a socket is ready .
Moreover , if the caller is not interested in using one or two of the three lists , it can pass either null or an empty list .
This forces the code to use the awkward test to control the loop because , when Select ( ) returns , one or two of the three lists may be null ( if the caller passed null ) or may be not null , but empty .
It is very easy to create a bad API and rather difficult to create a good one .
Even minor and quite innocent design flaws have a tendency to get magnified out of all proportion because APIs are provided once , but are called many times .
The problem here is that there are two legal parameter values for one and the same thing : both null and an empty list indicate that the caller is not interested in monitoring one of the passed lists .
In itself , this is not a big deal but , if I want to reuse Select ( ) as in the preceding code , it turns out to be rather inconvenient .
The second part of the code , which deals with restarting Select ( ) for time - outs greater than 35 minutes , also gets rather complex , both because of the awkward test needed to detect whether a time - out has indeed occurred and because of the need to deal with the case in which milliseconds * 1000 does not divide Int .
MaxValue without leaving a remainder .
We are not finished yet : the preceding code still contains comments in place of copying the input parameters and copying the results back into those parameters .
One would think that this is easy : simply call a Clone ( ) method , as one would do in Java .
Unlike Java , however , .NET 's type Object ( which is the ultimate base type of all types ) does not provide a Clone method ; instead , for a type to be cloneable , it must explicitly derive from an ICloneable interface .
The formal parameter type of the lists passed to Select ( ) is IList , which is an interface and , therefore , abstract : I cannot instantiate things of type IList , only things derived from IList .
The problem is that IList does not derive from ICloneable , so there is no convenient way to copy an IList except by explicitly iterating over the list contents and doing the job element by element .
Similarly , there is no method on IList that would allow it to be easily overwritten with the contents of another list ( which is necessary to copy the results back into the parameters before doSelect ( ) returns ) .
Again , the only way to achieve this is to iterate and copy the elements one at a time .
Another problem with Select ( ) is that it accepts lists of sockets .
Lists allow the same socket to appear more than once in each list , but doing so does n't make sense : conceptually , what is passed are sets of sockets .
So , why does Select ( ) use lists ?
The answer is simple : the .NET collection classes do not include a set abstraction .
Using IList to model a set is unfortunate : it creates a semantic problem because lists allow duplicates .
( The behavior of Select ( ) in the presence of duplicates is anybody 's guess because it is not documented ; checking against the actual behavior of the implementation is not all that useful because , in the absence of documentation , the behavior can change without warning . )
Using IList to model a set is also detrimental in other ways : when a connection closes , the server must remove the corresponding socket from its lists .
Doing so requires the server either to perform a linear search ( which does not scale well ) or to maintain the lists in sorted order so it can use a split search ( which is more work ) .
This is a good example of how design flaws have a tendency to spread and cause collateral damage : an oversight in one API causes grief in an unrelated API .
I will spare you the details of how to complete the wrapper code .
Suffice it to say that the supposedly simple wrapper I set out to write , by the time I had added parameter copying , error handling , and a few comments , ran to nearly 100 lines of fairly complex code .
All this because of a few seemingly minor design flaws :
Select ( ) overwrites its arguments .
overwrites its arguments .
Select ( ) does not provide a simple indicator that would allow the caller to distinguish a return because of a time - out from a return because a socket is ready .
does not provide a simple indicator that would allow the caller to distinguish a return because of a time - out from a return because a socket is ready .
Select ( ) does not allow a time - out longer than 35 minutes .
does not allow a time - out longer than 35 minutes .
Select ( ) uses lists instead of sets of sockets .
Here is what Select ( ) could look like instead :
With this version , the caller provides sets to monitor sockets for reading and writing , but no error set : sockets in both the read set and the write set are automatically monitored for errors .
The time - out is provided as a Timespan ( a type provided by . NET ) that has resolution down to 100 nanoseconds , a range of more than 10 million days , and can be negative ( or null ) to cover the " wait forever " case .
Instead of overwriting its arguments , this version returns the sockets that are ready for reading , writing , and have encountered an error as separate sets , and it returns the number of sockets that are ready or zero , in which case the call returned because the time - out was reached .
With this simple change , the usability problems disappear and , because the caller no longer needs to copy the arguments , the code is far more efficient as well .
There are many other ways to fix the problems with Select ( ) ( such as the approach used by epoll ( ) ) .
The point of this example is not to come up with the ultimate version of Select ( ) , but to demonstrate how a small number of minor oversights can quickly add up to create code that is messy , difficult to maintain , error prone , and inefficient .
With a slightly better interface to Select ( ) , none of the code I outlined here would be necessary , and I ( and probably many other programmers ) would have saved considerable time and effort .

The Cost of Poor APIs
The consequences of poor API design are numerous and serious .
Poor APIs are difficult to program with and often require additional code to be written , as in the preceding example .
If nothing else , this additional code makes programs larger and less efficient because each line of unnecessary code increases working set size and reduces CPU cache hits .
Moreover , as in the preceding example , poor design can lead to inherently inefficient code by forcing unnecessary data copies .
( Another popular design flawnamely , throwing exceptions for expected outcomesalso causes inefficiencies because catching and handling exceptions is almost always slower than testing a return value . )
The effects of poor APIs , however , go far beyond inefficient code : poor APIs are harder to understand and more difficult to work with than good ones .
In other words , programmers take longer to write code against poor APIs than against good ones , so poor APIs directly lead to increased development cost .
Poor APIs often require not only extra code , but also more complex code that provides more places where bugs can hide .
The cost is increased testing effort and increased likelihood for bugs to go undetected until the software is deployed in the field , when the cost of fixing bugs is highest .
Much of software development is about creating abstractions , and APIs are the visible interfaces to these abstractions .
Abstractions reduce complexity because they throw away irrelevant detail and retain only the information that is necessary for a particular job .
Abstractions do not exist in isolation ; rather , we layer abstractions on top of each other .
Application code calls higher - level libraries that , in turn , are often implemented by calling on the services provided by lower - level libraries that , in turn , call on the services provided by the system call interface of an operating system .
This hierarchy of abstraction layers is an immensely powerful and useful concept .
Without it , software as we know it could not exist because programmers would be completely overwhelmed by complexity .
The lower in the abstraction hierarchy an API defect occurs , the more serious are the consequences .
If I misdesign a function in my own code , the only person affected is me , because I am the only caller of the function .
If I mis -design a function in one of our project libraries , potentially all of my colleagues suffer .
If I mis -design a function in a widely published library , potentially tens of thousands of programmers suffer .
Of course , end users also suffer .
The suffering can take many forms , but the cumulative cost is invariably high .
For example , if Microsoft Word contains a bug that causes it to crash occasionally because of a mis-designed API , thousands or hundreds of thousands of end users lose valuable time .
Similarly , consider the numerous security holes in countless applications and system software that , ultimately , are caused by unsafe I/O and string manipulation functions in the standard C library ( such as scanf ( ) and strcpy ( ) ) .
The effects of these poorly designed APIs are still with us more than 30 years after they were created , and the cumulative cost of the design defects easily runs to many billions of dollars .
Perversely , layering of abstractions is often used to trivialize the impact of a bad API : " It does n't matterwe can just write a wrapper to hide the problems . "
This argument could not be more wrong because it ignores the cost of doing so .
First , even the most efficient wrapper adds some cost in terms of memory and execution speed ( and wrappers are often far from efficient ) .
Second , for a widely used API , the wrapper will be written thousands of times , whereas getting the API right in the first place needs to be done only once .
Third , more often than not , the wrapper creates its own set of problems : the . NET Select ( ) function is a wrapper around the underlying C function ; the .NET version first fails to fix the poor interface of the original , and then adds its own share of problems by omitting the return value , getting the time - out wrong , and passing lists instead of sets .
So , while creating a wrapper can help to make bad APIs more usable , that does not mean that bad APIs do not matter : two wrongs do n't make a right , and unnecessary wrappers just lead to bloatware .

How to do Better
There are a few guidelines to use when designing an API .
These are not surefire ways to guarantee success , but being aware of these guidelines and taking them explicitly into account during design makes it much more likely that the result will turn out to be usable .
The list is necessarily incompletedoing the topic justice would require a large book .
Nevertheless , here are a few of my favorite things to think about when creating an API .
An API must provide sufficient functionality for the caller to achieve its task .
This seems obvious : an API that provides insufficient functionality is not complete .
As illustrated by the inability of Select ( ) to wait more than 35 minutes , however , such insufficiency can go undetected .
It pays to go through a checklist of functionality during the design and ask , " Have I missed anything ? "
An API should be minimal , without imposing undue inconvenience on the caller .
This guideline simply says " smaller is better . "
The fewer types , functions , and parameters an API uses , the easier it is to learn , remember , and use correctly .
This minimalism is important .
Many APIs end up as a kitchen sink of convenience functions that can be composed of other , more fundamental functions .
( The C++ standard string class with its more than 100 member functions is an example .
After many years of programming in C++ , I still find myself unable to use standard strings for anything nontrivial without consulting the manual . )
The qualification of this guideline , without imposing undue inconvenience on the caller , is important because it draws attention to real - world use cases .
To design an API well , the designer must have an understanding of the environment in which the API will be used and design to that environment .
Whether or not to provide a nonfundamental convenience function depends on how often the designer anticipates that function will be needed .
If the function will be used frequently , it is worth adding ; if it is used only occasionally , the added complexity is unlikely to be worth the rare gain in convenience .
A big problem with API documentation is that it is usually written after the API is implemented , and often written by the implementer .
The Unix kernel violates this guideline with wait ( ) , waitpid( ) , wait3 ( ) , and wait4 ( ) .
The wait4 ( ) function is sufficient because it can be used to implement the functionality of the first three .
There is also waitid( ) , which could almost , but not quite , be implemented in terms of wait4 ( ) .
The caller has to read the documentation for all five functions in order to work out which one to use .
It would be simpler and easier for the caller to have a single combined function instead .
This is also an example of how concerns about backward compatibility erode APIs over time : the API accumulates crud that , eventually , does more damage than the good it ever did by remaining backward compatible .
( And the sordid history of stumbling design remains for all the world to see . )
APIs cannot be designed without an understanding of their context .
Consider a class that provides access to a set of name value pairs of strings , such as environment variables :
The lookup method provides access to the value stored by the named variable .
Obviously , if a variable with the given name is set , the function returns its value .
How should the function behave if the variable is not set ?
There are several options :
Throw a VariableNotSet exception .
exception .
Return null .
Return the empty string .
Throwing an exception is appropriate if the designer anticipates that looking for a variable that is n't there is not a common case and likely to indicate something that the caller would treat as an error .
If so , throwing an exception is exactly the right thing because exceptions force the caller to deal with the error .
On the other hand , the caller may look up a variable and , if it is not set , substitute a default value .
If so , throwing an exception is exactly the wrong thing because handling an exception breaks the normal flow of control and is more difficult than testing for a null or empty return value .
Assuming that we decide not to throw an exception if a variable is not set , two obvious choices indicate that a lookup failed : return null or the empty string .
Which one is correct ?
Again , the answer depends on the anticipated use cases .
Returning null allows the caller to distinguish a variable that is not set at all from a variable that is set to the empty string , whereas returning the empty string for variables that are not set makes it impossible to distinguish a variable that was never set from a variable that was explicitly set to the empty string .
Returning null is necessary if it is deemed important to be able to make this distinction ; but , if the distinction is not important , it is better to return the empty string and never return null .
General - purpose APIs should be " policy - free ; " special - purpose APIs should be " policy - rich . "
In the preceding guideline , I mentioned that correct design of an API depends on its context .
This leads to a more fundamental design issuenamely , that APIs inevitably dictate policy : an API performs optimally only if the caller 's use of the API is in agreement with the designer 's anticipated use cases .
Conversely , the designer of an API cannot help but dictate to the caller a particular set of semantics and a particular style of programming .
It is important for designers to be aware of this : the extent to which an API sets policy has profound influence on its usability .
If little is known about the context in which an API is going to be used , the designer has little choice but to keep all options open and allow the API to be as widely applicable as possible .
In the preceding lookup example , this calls for returning null for variables that are not set , because that choice allows the caller to layer its own policy on top of the API ; with a few extra lines of code , the caller can treat lookup of a nonexistent variable as a hard error , substitute a default value , or treat unset and empty variables as equivalent .
This generality , however , comes at a price for those callers who do not need the flexibility because it makes it harder for the caller to treat lookup of a nonexistent variable as an error .
This design tension is present in almost every API the line between what should and should not be an error is very fine , and placing the line incorrectly quickly causes major pain .
The more that is known about the context of an API , the more " fascist " the API can becomethat is , the more policy it can set .
Doing so is doing a favor to the caller because it catches errors that otherwise would go undetected .
With careful design of types and parameters , errors can often be caught at compile time instead of being delayed until run time .
Making the effort to do this is worthwhile because every error caught at compile time is one less bug that can incur extra cost during testing or in the field .
The Select ( ) API fails this guideline because , by overwriting its arguments , it sets a policy that is in direct conflict with the most common use case .
Similarly , the . NET Receive ( ) API commits this crime for nonblocking sockets : it throws an exception if the call worked but no data is ready , and it returns zero without an exception if the connection is lost .
This is the precise opposite of what the caller needs , and it is sobering to look at the mess of control flow this causes for the caller .
Sometimes , the design tension cannot be resolved despite the best efforts of the designer .
This is often the case when little can be known about context because an API is low - level or must , by its nature , work in many different contexts ( as is the case for general - purpose collection classes , for example ) .
In this case , the strategy pattern can often be used to good effect .
It allows the caller to supply a policy ( for example , in the form of a caller - provided comparison function that is used to maintain ordered collections ) and so keeps the design open .
Depending on the programming language , caller - provided policies can be implemented with callbacks , virtual functions , delegates , or template parameters ( among others ) .
If the API provides sensible defaults , such externalized policies can lead to more flexibility without compromising usability and clarity .
( Be careful , though , not to " pass the buck , " as described later in this article . )
APIs should be designed from the perspective of the caller .
When a programmer is given the job of creating an API , he or she is usually immediately in problem - solving mode :
What data structures and algorithms do I need for the job , and what input and output parameters are necessary to get it done ?
It 's all downhill from there : the implementer is focused on solving the problem , and the concerns of the caller are quickly forgotten .
Here is a typical example of this :
This evidently is a function call that creates a TV .
But what is the meaning of the parameters ?
Compare with the following :
The second version is much more readable to the caller : even without reading the manual , it is obvious that the call creates a color flat - screen TV .
To the implementer , however , the first version is just as usable :
The implementer gets nicely named variables that indicate whether the TV is black and white or color , and whether it has a flat screen or a conventional one , but that information is lost to the caller .
The second version requires the implementer to do more worknamely , to add enum definitions and change the function signature :
This alternative definition requires the implementer to think about the problem in terms of the caller .
However , the implementer is preoccupied with getting the TV created , so there is little room in the implementer 's mind for worrying about somebody else 's problems .
A great way to get usable APIs is to let the customer ( namely , the caller ) write the function signature , and to give that signature to a programmer to implement .
This step alone eliminates at least half of poor APIs : too often , the implementers of APIs never use their own creations , with disastrous consequences for usability .
Moreover , an API is not about programming , data structures , or algorithmsan API is a user interface , just as much as a GUI .
The user at the using end of the API is a programmerthat is , a human being .
Even though we tend to think of APIs as machine interfaces , they are not : they are human - machine interfaces .
There is also a belief that older programmers " lose the edge . "
That belief is mistaken in my opinion ; older programmers may not burn as much midnight oil as younger ones , but that 's not because they are old , but because they get the job done without having to stay up past midnight .
What should drive the design of APIs is not the needs of the implementer .
After all , the implementer needs to implement the API only once , but the callers of the API need to call it hundreds or thousands of times .
This means that good APIs are designed with the needs of the caller in mind , even if that makes the implementer 's job more complicated .
Good APIs do n't pass the buck .
There are many ways to " pass the buck " when designing an API .
A favorite way is to be afraid of setting policy : " Well , the caller might want to do this or that , and I can't be sure which , so I 'll make it configurable . "
The typical outcome of this approach is functions that take five or 10 parameters .
Because the designer does not have the spine to set policy and be clear about what the API should and should not do , the API ends up with far more complexity than necessary .
This approach also violates minimalism and the principle of " I should not pay for what I do n't use " : if a function has 10 parameters , five of which are irrelevant for the majority of use cases , callers pay the price of supplying 10 parameters every time they make a call , even when they could not care less about the functionality provided by the extra five parameters .
A good API is clear about what it wants to achieve and what it does not want to achieve , and is not afraid to be upfront about it .
The resulting simplicity usually amply repays the minor loss of functionality , especially if the API has well - chosen fundamental operations that can easily be composed into more complex ones .
Another way of passing the buck is to sacrifice usability on the altar of efficiency .
For example , the CORBA C++ mapping requires callers to fastidiously keep track of memory allocation and deallocation responsibilities ; the result is an API that makes it incredibly easy to corrupt memory .
When benchmarking the mapping , it turns out to be quite fast because it avoids many memory allocations and deallocations .
The performance gain , however , is an illusion because , instead of the API doing the dirty work , it makes the caller responsible for doing the dirty workoverall , the same number of memory allocations takes place regardless .
In other words , a safer API could be provided with zero runtime overhead .
By benchmarking only the work done inside the API ( instead of the overall work done by both caller and API ) , the designers can claim to have created a better - performing API , even though the performance advantage is due only to selective accounting .
The original C version of Select ( ) exhibits the same approach :
Like the .NET version , the C version also overwrites its arguments .
This again reflects the needs of the implementer rather than the caller : it is easier and more efficient to clobber the arguments than to allocate separate output arrays of file descriptors , and it avoids the problems of how to deallocate the output arrays again .
All this really does , however , is shift the burden from implementer to callerat a net efficiency gain of zero .
The Unix kernel also is not without blemish and passes the buck occasionally : many a programmer has cursed the decision to allow some system calls to be interrupted , forcing programmers to deal explicitly with EINTR and restart interrupted system calls manually , instead of having the kernel do this transparently .
Passing the buck can take many different forms , the details of which vary greatly from API to API .
The key questions for the designer are :
Is there anything I could reasonably do for the caller I am not doing ?
If so , do I have valid reasons for not doing it ?
Explicitly asking these questions makes design the result of a conscious process and discourages " design by accident . "
APIs should be documented before they are implemented .
A big problem with API documentation is that it is usually written after the API is implemented , and often written by the implementer .
The implementer , however , is mentally contaminated by the implementation and will have a tendency simply to write down what he or she has done .
This often leads to incomplete documentation because the implementer is too familiar with the API and assumes that some things are obvious when they are not .
Worse , it often leads to APIs that miss important use cases entirely .
On the other hand , if the caller ( not the implementer ) writes the documentation , the caller can approach the problem from a " this is what I need " perspective , unburdened by implementation concerns .
This makes it more likely that the API addresses the needs of the caller and prevents many design flaws from arising in the first place .
Of course , the caller may ask for something that turns out to be unreasonable from an implementation perspective .
Caller and implementer can then iterate over the design until they reach agreement .
That way , neither caller nor implementation concerns are neglected .
Once documented and implemented , the API should be tried out by someone unfamiliar with it .
Initially , that person should check how much of the API can be understood without looking at the documentation .
If an API can be used without documentation , chances are that it is good : a self - documenting API is the best kind of API there is .
While test driving the API and its documentation , the user is likely to ask important " what if " questions :
What if the third parameter is null ?
Is that legal ?
What if I want to wait indefinitely for a socket to become ready ?
Can I do that ?
These questions often pinpoint design flaws , and a cross-check with the documentation will confirm whether the questions have answers and whether the answers are reasonable .
With the ever - growing importance of computing , there are APIs whose correct functioning is important almost beyond description .
Make sure that documentation is complete , particularly with respect to error behavior .
The behavior of an API when things go wrong is as much a part of the formal contract as when things go right .
Does the documentation say whether the API maintains the strong exception guarantee ?
Does it detail the state of out and in - out parameters in case of an error ?
Does it detail any side effects that may linger after an error has occurred ?
Does it provide enough information for the caller to make sense of an error ?
( Throwing a DidntWork exception from all socket operations just does n't cut it ! )
Programmers do need to know how an API behaves when something goes wrong , and they do need to get detailed error information they can process programmatically .
( Human - readable error messages are nice for diagnostics and debugging , but not nice if they are the only things availablethere is nothing worse than having to write a parser for error strings just so I can control the flow of my program . )
Unit and system testing also have an impact on APIs because they can expose things that no one thought of earlier .
Test results can help improve the documentation and , therefore , the API .
( Yes , the documentation is part of the API . )
The worst person to write documentation is the implementer , and the worst time to write documentation is after implementation .
Doing so greatly increases the chance that interface , implementation , and documentation will all have problems .
Good APIs are ergonomic .
Ergonomics is a major field of study in its own right , and probably one of the hardest parts of API design to pin down .
Much has been written about this topic in the form of style guides that define naming conventions , code layout , documentation style , and so on .
Beyond mere style issues though , achieving good ergonomics is hard because it raises complex cognitive and psychological issues .
Programmers are humans and are not created with cookie cutters , so an API that seems fine to one programmer can be perceived as only so - so by another .
Especially for large and complex APIs , a major part of ergonomics relates to consistency .
For example , an API is easier to use if its functions always place parameters of a particular type in the same order .
Similarly , APIs are easier to use if they establish naming themes that group related functions together with a particular naming style .
The same is true for APIs that establish simple and uniform conventions for related tasks and that use uniform error handling .
Consistency is important because not only does it make things easier to use and memorize , but it also enables transference of learning : having learned a part of an API , the caller also has learned much of the remainder of the API and so experiences minimal friction .
Transference is important not only within APIs but also across APIsthe more concepts APIs can adopt from each other , the easier it becomes to master all of them .
( The Unix standard I / O library violates this idea in a number of places .
For example , the read ( ) and write ( ) system calls place the file descriptor first , but the standard library I /O calls , such as fgets ( ) and fputs ( ) , place the stream pointer last , except for fscan ( ) and fprint ( ) , which place it first .
This lack of parallelism is jarring to many people . )
Good ergonomics and getting an API to " feel " right require a lot of expertise because the designer has to juggle numerous and often conflicting demands .
Finding the correct trade - off among these demands is the hallmark of good design .

API Change Requires Cultural Change
I am convinced that it is possible to do better when it comes to API design .
Apart from the nitty - gritty technical issues , I believe that we need to address a number of cultural issues to get on top of the API problem .
What we need is not only technical wisdom , but also a change in the way we teach and practice software engineering .
Education .
Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s , when I was cutting my teeth as a programmer and getting my degree , much of the emphasis in a budding programmer 's education was on data structures and algorithms .
They were the bread and butter of programming , and a good understanding of data structures such as lists , balanced trees , and hash tables was essential , as was a good understanding of common algorithms and their performance trade - offs .
These were also the days when system libraries provided only the most basic functions , such as simple I/O and string manipulation ; higher - level functions such as bsearch ( ) and qsort ( ) were the exception rather than the rule .
This meant that it was de rigueur for a competent programmer to know how to write various data structures and manipulate them efficiently .
We have moved on considerably since then .
Virtually every major development platform today comes with libraries full of pre-canned data structures and algorithms .
In fact , these days , if I catch a programmer writing a linked list , that person had better have a very good reason for doing so instead of using an implementation provided by a system library .
Similarly , during this period , if I wanted to create software , I had to write pretty much everything from scratch : if I needed encryption , I wrote it from scratch ; if I needed compression , I wrote it from scratch ; if I needed inter - process communication , I wrote it from scratch .
All this has changed dramatically with the open source movement .
Today , open source is available for almost every imaginable kind of reusable functionality .
As a result , the process of creating software has changed considerably : instead of creating functionality , much of today 's software engineering is about integrating existing functionality or about repackaging it in some way .
To put it differently : API design today is much more important than it was 20 years ago , not only because we are designing more APIs , but also because these APIs tend to provide access to much richer and more complex functionality .
Looking at the curriculum of many universities , it seems that this shift in emphasis has gone largely unnoticed .
In my days as an undergraduate , no one ever bothered to explain how to decide whether something should be a return value or an out parameter , how to choose between raising an exception and returning an error code , or how to decide if it might be appropriate for a function to modify its arguments .
Little seems to have changed since then : my son , who is currently working toward a software engineering degree at the same university where I earned my degree , tells me that still no one bothers to explain these things .
Little wonder then that we see so many poorly designed APIs : it is not reasonable to expect programmers to be good at something they have never been taught .
Yet , good API design , even though complex , is something that can be taught .
If undergraduates can learn how to write hash tables , they can also learn when it is appropriate to throw an exception as opposed to returning an error code , and they can learn to distinguish a poor API from a good one .
What is needed is recognition of the importance of the topic ; much of the research and wisdom are available alreadyall we need to do is pass them on .
Career Path .
I am 49 , and I write code .
Looking around me , I realize how unusual this is : in my company , all of my programming colleagues are younger than I and , when I look at former programming colleagues , most of them no longer write code ; instead , they have moved on to different positions ( such as project manager ) or have left the industry entirely .
I see this trend everywhere in the software industry : older programmers are rare , quite often because no career path exists for them beyond a certain point .
I recall how much effort it took me to resist a forced " promotion " into a management position at a former companyI ended up staying a programmer , but was told that future pay increases were pretty much out of the question if I was unwilling to move into management .
There is also a belief that older programmers " lose the edge " and do n't cut it anymore .
That belief is mistaken in my opinion ; older programmers may not burn as much midnight oil as younger ones , but that 's not because they are old , but because they get the job done without having to stay up past midnight .
This loss of older programmers is unfortunate , particularly when it comes to API design .
While good API design can be learned , there is no substitute for experience .
Many good APIs were created by programmers who had to suffer under a bad one and then decided to redo the job , but properly this time .
It takes time and a healthy dose of " once burned , twice shy " to gather the expertise that is necessary to do better .
Unfortunately , the industry trend is to promote precisely its most experienced people away from programming , just when they could put their accumulated expertise to good use .
Another trend is for companies to promote their best programmers to designer or system architect .
Typically , these programmers are farmed out to various projects as consultants , with the aim of ensuring that the project takes off on the right track and avoids mistakes it might make without the wisdom of the consultants .
The intent of this practice is laudable , but the outcome is usually sobering : because the consultants are so valuable , having given their advice , they are moved to the next project long before implementation is finished , let alone testing and delivery .
By the time the consultants have moved on , any problems with their earlier sage advice are no longer their problems , but the problems of a project they have long since left behind .
In other words , the consultants never get to live through the consequences of their own design decisions , which is a perfect way to breed them into incompetence .
The way to keep designers sharp and honest is to make them eat their own dog food .
Any process that deprives designers of that feedback is ultimately doomed to failure .
External Controls .
Years ago , I was working on a large development project that , for contractual reasons , was forced into an operating - system upgrade during a critical phase shortly before a delivery deadline .
After the upgrade , the previously working system started behaving strangely and occasionally produced random and inexplicable failures .
The process of tracking down the problem took nearly two days , during which a large team of programmers was mostly twiddling its thumbs .
Ultimately , the cause turned out to be a change in the behavior of awk's index ( ) function .
Once we identified the problem , the fix was trivialwe simply installed the previous version of awk .
The point is that a minor change in the semantics of a minor part of an API had cost the project thousands of dollars , and the change was the result of a side effect of a programmer fixing an unrelated bug .
This anecdote hints at a problem we will increasingly have to face in the future .
With the ever - growing importance of computing , there are APIs whose correct functioning is important almost beyond description .
For example , consider the importance of APIs such as the Unix system call interface , the C library , Win32 , or OpenSSL .
Any change in interface or semantics of these APIs incurs an enormous economic cost and can introduce vulnerabilities .
It is irresponsible to allow a single company ( let alone a single developer ) to make changes to such critical APIs without external controls .
As an analogy , a building contractor cannot simply try out a new concrete mixture to see how well it performs .
To use a new concrete mixture , a lengthy testing and approval process must be followed , and failure to follow that process incurs criminal penalties .
At least for mission - critical APIs , a similar process is necessary , as a matter of self - defense : if a substantial fraction of the world 's economy depends on the safety and correct functioning of certain APIs , it stands to reason that any changes to these APIs should be carefully monitored .
Whether such controls should take the form of legislation and criminal penalties is debatable .
Legislation would likely introduce an entirely new set of problems , such as stifling innovation and making software more expensive .
( The ongoing legal battle between Microsoft and the European Union is a case in point . )
I see a real danger of just such a scenario occurring .
Up to now , we have been lucky , and the damage caused by malware such as worms has been relatively minor .
We wo n't be lucky forever : the first worm to exploit an API flaw to wipe out more than 10 % of the world 's PCs would cause economic and human damage on such a scale that legislators would be kicked into action .
If that were to happen , we would likely swap one set of problems for another one that is worse .
What are the alternatives to legislation ?
The open source community has shown the way for many years : open peer review of APIs and implementations has proven an extremely effective way to ferret out design flaws , inefficiencies , and security holes .
This process avoids the problems associated with legislation , catches many flaws before an API is widely used , and makes it more likely that , when a zeroday defect is discovered , it is fixed and a patch distributed promptly .
In the future , we will likely see a combination of both tighter legislative controls and more open peer review .
Finding the right balance between the two is crucial to the future of computing and our economy .
API design truly mattersbut we had better realize it before events run away with things and remove any choice .

Gaping US trade and budget deficits and a weak auction of government debt that pushed interest rates higher pointed to a bumpy road to recovery for the world 's largest economy on Wednesday .
A Federal Reserve report noting businesses see some signs of moderation in the contraction , even though conditions were weak or deteriorated further in May , failed to ease anxiety about the economy .
Instead , financial markets found new reasons to worry that massive government spending and Fed cash infusions will lead to dangerous inflation and undercut any fledgling rebound .
A government bond auction pushed yields on the benchmark 10 - year Treasury note above 4 per cent for the first time in eight months , suggesting investors want the government to pay a premium to finance its huge deficit .
US stocks ended little changed though , with the three month rally stalling on worry that rising interest rates could dampen consumer and business spending .
No .
If you refer to creationism or " creation science " , no .
In the first place , there is no such thing as a creation theory ; the best attempts so far are nothing more than hypotheses , posited by virtue of a need to justify a literal interpretation of The Bible .
They will only become theories when the evidence supports that viewpoint ; suffice to say , it wo n't .
Further to this , there is no evidence to support the few basic claims made by creationists , such as a young earth / universe , direct creation ' as - is ' of all species , and most of the myths in the Old Testament ( such as Noah 's flood ) .
All evidence suggests the complete opposite : an old earth and universe , gradual development of biodiversity , and the absence of any such major events as a global flood .
Many creationists and creationist institutes have been founded to attempt furthering both " research " into the subject in favour of the idea , and to continue a basic propaganda mission in favour of converting people to that view .
The few real research projects undertaken by these groups have completely invalidated their own initial ideas , notably for example the RATE project .
Most other work consists of misinterpreting , misapplying and misunderstanding much of modern science , and ignoring basic techniques required to ensure validity and accuracy in the conclusions reached .
In effect - and this has been demonstrated in both legal and true scientific fields - creationism and its offshoots are simply attempts to insert religion into the secular world , almost invariably under direction from fundamentalist Christian sects .
Another answer :
Yes .
It is quite clear from the well know evolutionist Michael Ruse who once famously stated " Evolution is a religion ... " - that it is not just creationists who have a presupposition that drives their research .
Everyone does .
However , putting all philosophy aside it must be understood that real evidence exists in every field of science : Biology and Biochemistry , Genetics and Geology , Astronomy and Astrophysics as well as the Laws of Thermodynamics and ( Biological ) Information Theory ( Dr Werner Gitt ) .
This points to the fact that complex information , as well as the ability to read ( decode ) that information from the DNA ( as well as the amazing DNA itself ) requires intelligent input and points thus to the creator .
The fact is that reputable laboratories ( not creationists ) have repeatedly found Carbon 14 in diamonds , coal and petrified wood , which according to evolutionary dating , are way too old for their to be any left in the sample .
Consider also :
1 ) The glaring lack of transitional fossils has been noted by the evolutionists themselves , such as this statement from the famous paleontologist and evolutionist George G. Simpson ; quote : " The regular lack of transitional fossils is not confined to primates alone , but is an almost universal phenomenon . "
" The lack of transitional series cannot be explained as being due to the scarcity of material .
The deficiencies are real ; they will never be filled " ( Nilsson , N. Heribert ) .
" To the unprejudiced , the fossil record of plants is in favor of special creation " ( Corner , E.J.H. , Contemporary Botanical Thought ) .
2 ) Instances of falsifying of evidence by evolutionists , such as Haeckel 's drawings , Archaeoraptor , the Cardiff " specimen , " and Piltdown Man .
" Haeckel exaggerated the similarities [ between embryos of different species ] by idealizations and omissions , in a procedure that can only be called fraudulent .
His drawings never fooled embryologists , who recognized his fudgings right from the start .
The drawings , despite their noted inaccuracies , entered into the standard student textbooks of biology .
Once ensconced in textbooks , misinformation becomes cocooned and effectively permanent , because textbooks copy from previous texts .
We do , I think , have the right to be both astonished and ashamed by the century of mindless recycling that has led to the persistence of these drawings in a large number , if not a majority , of modern textbooks ( Stephen Gould ) .
Dr. Jonathan Wells published a book in 2002 entitled Icons of Evolution .
Dr. Wells states that the book shows that " the best - known ' evidences ' for Darwin 's theory have been exaggerated , distorted or even faked . "
3 ) Creationists see the " survival of the fittest " and the dating of rock layers by fossils as being perfect tautologies .
4 ) The fact that some qualified , educated , normal scientists do not believe in evolution .
Or at least question it , even if they still preach evolution : " Nine - tenths of the talk of evolutionists is sheer nonsense , not founded on observation and wholly unsupported by facts .
This museum is full of proofs of the utter falsity of their views .
In all this great museum , there is not a particle of evidence of the transmutation of species " ( Dr. Etheridge , Paleontologist of the British Museum ) .
" To postulate that the development and survival of the fittest is entirely a consequence of chance mutations seems to me a hypothesis based on no evidence and irreconcilable with the facts .
It amazes me that this is swallowed so uncritically and readily , and for such a long time , by so many scientists without murmur of protest " ( Sir Ernest Chain , Nobel Prize winner ) .
5 ) The fact that there is a shared , worldwide tradition among every ancient society that the world was created .
6 ) Evolving of new species has not been witnessed during known history .
7 ) Mutations are harmful , not beneficial .
One of the tasks of DNA and of long - term breeding is to avoid or repair any changes brought about by mutations .
This means that our genetic apparatus is programmed to resist change .
8 ) Mutations , even if beneficial , do not create new organs .
9 ) The fact that a great number of fossils have been found in the " wrong " rock - layers according to what evolutionary paleontology would require .
10 ) The fact that you need DNA to make DNA .
No genetic code can be demonstrated to have arisen by chance , together with the ability to read that code and carry out its instructions .
Information does not arise spontaneously ; and there is an incredible amount of information in even the tiniest cell .
" A living cell is so awesomely complex that its interdependent components stagger the imagination and defy evolutionary explanations " ( Michael Denton , author ) .
" The astounding structural complexity of a cell " ( U.S. National Library of Medicine ) .
Concerning a single structure within a cell : " Without the motor protein , the microtubules do n't slide and the cilium simply stands rigid .
Without nexin , the tubules will slide against each other until they completely move past each other and the cilium disintegrates .
Without the tubulin , there are no microtubules and no motion .
The cilium is irreducibly complex .
Like a mousetrap , it has all the properties of design and none of the properties of natural selection " ( Michael Behe , prof. of biophysics ) .
11 ) The problem of the impossibility of abiogenesis in general .
" The concept of abiogenesis is not science .
It 's fantasy " ( J.L. Wile , Ph.D. ) .
12 ) The fact that evolution was once used as support for the belief that Blacks ( or others ) are less than highly - evolved humans .
" Darwin was also convinced that the Europeans were evolutionarily more advanced than the black races " ( Steven Rose , author ) .
He also " reasoned that males are more evolutionarily advanced than females " ( B. Kevics , author ) .

In the American Conservative , Antiwar.com editor Justin Raitmando ( whom I often disagree with ) has a piece detailing some more leftist hypocrisy concerning their Messiah and his plans to expand the Afghan War
The antiwar rally at the University of Iowa was sparsely attended .
The below 30 degree weather might have had something to do with it , but Paul Street , a local writer and one of the speakers , had another theory , as the Daily Iowan reported :
Before the crowd of fewer than 20 , Street questioned why the ‘ left ’ locals and university officials are n’t doing more to help in the protests against the war .
‘ The big truth right now , whether this town ’s missing - in - action progressives get it or not , is that we need to fight the rich , not their wars , ’ he said , citing big corporations for wasting their technology and funding on war .
The big truth is that the antiwar movement has largely collapsed in the face of Barack Obama ’s victory : the massive antiwar marches that were a feature of the Bush years are a thing of the past .
Those ostensibly antiwar organizations that did so much to agitate against the Iraq
War have now fallen into line behind their commander in chief and are simply awaiting orders .
Take , for example , Moveon.org , the online activist group that ran antiwar ads during the election — but only against Republicans — in coalition with a group of labor unions and Americans Against Escalation in Iraq .
Behind AAEI stood three of Obama ’s top political operatives , Steve Hildebrand , Paul Tewes , and Brad Woodhouse .
Woodhouse is now the Democratic National Committee ’s director of communications and research .
He controls the massive e-mail list culled by the Obama campaign during the primaries and subsequently , as well as a list of all those who gave money to the presumed peace candidate .
These donors are no doubt wondering what Obama is doing escalating the war in Afghanistan and venturing into Pakistan .
As Greg Sargent noted over at WhoRunsGov.com , a Washington Post - sponsored site , “ Do n’t look now , but President Obama ’s announcement today of an escalation in the American presence in Afghanistan is being met with mostly silence — and even some support — from the most influential liberal groups who opposed the Iraq War . ”
In response to inquiries , Moveon.org refused to make any public statement about Obama ’s rollout of the Af - Pak escalation , although someone described as “ an official close to the group ” is cited by WhoRunsGov as confirming that “ MoveOn would n’t be saying anything in the near term . ”
A vague promise to poll their members was mentioned — “ though it ’s unclear when . ”
Do n’t hold your breath .
Another Democratic
Party front masquerading as a peace group , Americans United for Change , declined to comment on the war plans of the new administration .
This astroturf organization ran $ 600,000 worth of television ads in the summer of 2007 , focusing like a laser on congressional districts with Republican incumbents .
Change ?
Not so fast .
The boldest of the peacenik sellouts , however , is Jon Soltz of VoteVets , described by WhoRunsGov as “ among the most pugnacious anti-Iraq war groups . ”
They came out fists flying , endorsing the escalation of the Long War .
According to Soltz , there is “ much to like in the plan , ” but his faves boil down to three factors , which supposedly represent “ a stark departure ” from the bad old days of the Bush administration .
He applauds the administration ’s recognition that “ The military ca n’t do it all . ”
Yet we ’re increasing the troop levels by some 17,000 , plus 4,000 trainers to babysit the barely existent Afghan “ army . ”
We ’re going to send thousands more civilians — aid workers , medical personnel , and military contractors — to build the infrastructure lacking in Afghan society and promote fealty to the central government in Kabul .
Schools , clinics , roads , and shopping malls will be built with American tax dollars in order to foster trust between the Afghans , their occupiers , and their government .
There are many folks that would love to get involved in property investment so they can possibly make the most of their money .
However , you need to do your due diligence and know just what you ’re getting into .
You ca n’t just impulsively buy the very first thing which catches your eye .
This article will give you information on being better at dealing with all of this .
When you decide to start doing property investing , you should make things professional by establishing your own LLC .
This will give you , as well as your investments , a good layer of protection heading into the future .
You ’ll also give yourself better odds of tax breaks and benefits because of your business dealings .
Be mindful of how your reputation is something that you need to maintain when you start working in this industry .
As such , you need to always keep your word .
Also , never lie to a prospective client .
This will afford you credibility in the area and hopefully , engender loyalty from clients that turn into a steady business .
Learn all you can about how properties are priced in the area that you select for your work .
Rent costs and mortgages can give you good ideas about specific property values .
Once you get a good comprehension of conditions at the street level , then you make smarter decisions .
Try to stay inside a comfortable niche .
When you know your market well , then you will be a lot more successful .
Whether you choose to specialize in starter homes , low - down - payment investments , or just flipping homes , stick with what you know if you ’d like to see more success .
There are two guidelines you should consider if you start investing in any commercial properties .
They are to avoid overpaying for a plot or the business too .
You need to look at a physical property independently from the kind of rental income that a business on that plot might generate for you .
It ’s knowing both of these numbers that will help you find a good deal .
Do more listening than speaking when there are negotiations underway .
You might be surprised just how frequently someone else does all the work for you if you just let them speak .
You never know how close they might bring both of you to the price that you ’re hoping for .
If you ’re thinking about renting out a property that you invest in , then be wary about who you rent it out too .
Be sure that any tenants you get pay you a deposit plus the rent for the first and last months .
If that ’s not possible with a tenant , then they ’re likely to default on their rental agreement sooner or later .
Try to find someone else .
It ’s crucial that you have all the right information and ideas when you try to deal with property investment .
Now that you ’ve read all of this , you at least have some of it .
Spend enough time reading things like this , and you ’ll lay a terrific foundation for a career focused on investing in properties .
Scientists have picked the first crew of Earthlings to fly to another planet .
Those chosen for a Mars mission to be launched in October include specimens of thale cress and brewer 's yeast , and a microbe known as Conan the Bacterium .
Together with several other microscopic organisms , these representatives of earthly life will be carried in a package that will be flown on a Russian robot spacecraft and are scheduled to be returned to Earth in 2012 .
The experiment - Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment , or Life - is designed to show if living organisms can survive unprotected in space for long periods and thus support the theory of panspermia , which argues that simple organisms can survive for years as they float through space and that life on Earth could have been wafted here from another world .
" Some scientists believe the solar system 's first living organisms may have originally evolved on Mars and were then blasted to Earth on debris that was thrown into space when meteorites crashed on to Mars , " said Dr Bruce Betts , of the US Planetary Society , which has funded the $ 1 m Life project .
" On Earth these simple microbe - like beings then started to evolve - ultimately into animals and humans .
In other words , we may all be Martians under our skin . "
The idea that simple life forms could survive unprotected in space is controversial but has been backed by recent discoveries of bacteria that thrive in boiling , acid springs , in nuclear reactors , in vents deep below the oceans and other extremely hostile environments .
However , no one has yet tested bacteria 's ability to survive for years in deep space .
In fact , the mission is not being aimed at Mars but at Phobos , the larger of the planet 's two moons .
It will be crossing interplanetary space , nevertheless , making the organisms in the Life capsule Earth 's first interplanetary travellers .
The Russian mission , called Phobus - Grunt ( the Russian word for soil is grunt ) , will take 10 months to reach Mars and will then spend several more months in orbit round the planet before landing on Phobos .
It will collect a sample of its soil and blast back to Earth , along with the Life capsule .
These few scoops of material will become the first sample of extraterrestrial soil to be brought to Earth since the lunar missions of the 1970s .
The fact that the probe will be making an Earth - Mars return journey made it especially interesting to the Planetary Society , added Betts .
The organisation , based in Pasadena , California , is backed by space flight enthusiasts and has paid for several experiments that have been undertaken in space , including some carried out on space shuttle missions .
" In low Earth orbit , living beings are protected by Earth 's powerful magnetic field , which deflects cosmic rays and also the Sun 's most intense radiation .
So it is impossible to test if bacteria and other organisms could survive interplanetary space in craft , such as the space station or space shuttle , that only orbit a few hundred miles above Earth .
" However , by taking them to Mars and back , we will discover if our samples are hardy enough to survive the intense radiation that can be experienced in deep space , " added Betts .
The Phobos - Grunt mission will last for 34 months and will carry its samples of Earth 's humbler life forms in a three - inch - diameter titanium case .
These will include the bacterium deinococcus radiodurans , whose ability to survive intense radiation has earned it the scientific nickname Conan the Bacterium .
Other life forms will include thale cress ; tiny water creature tardigrade - or water bear - which can also survive extraordinary extremes of temperature and pressure ; samples of brewer 's yeast , one of the most widely studied organisms on Earth ; and some grains of permafrost from the Siberian Arctic .
This last sample contains many different microbes and will be used to determine if a living colony of interdependent organisms are hardier and more resistant to radiation than a single microbial species .
The Russian aerospace company NPO Lavochkin , which is building and launching Phobos - Grunt , has given a launch date in October , while acknowledging that this deadline will be tight .
The company has also insisted that the Life capsule will not break open in the event of Phobos - Grunt missing its target and plunging into Mars .

To configure enable mode access , you can use one of two commands : enable password or enable secret .
Both commands accomplish the same thing , allowing access to enable mode .
However , the enable secret command is considered to be more secure because it uses a one −way encryption scheme based on the MD5 hashing function .
Only use the enable password command with older IOS images and / or boot ROMs that have no knowledge of the newer enable secret command .
You configure an enable password by entering the enable password command in global configuration mode :
CiscoRouter #config t
Enter configuration commands , one per line .
End with CNTL/Z .
CiscoRouter ( config ) #enable password VisaGoogla
CiscoRouter ( config ) #end
CiscoRouter #
The preceding configuration sets the enable password to VisaGoogla .
The result of setting the enable password can be seen in the following output .
From the user mode prompt , you must enter the enable command to gain access into privileged mode :
CiscoRouter > enable
Password : VisaGoogla
CiscoRouter #
Note :
After you enter the enable command , the password you type at the password prompt will not be displayed .
Be sure to type the password exactly as it is configured in the enable password command .
You configure an enable secret password by entering the following command in global configuration mode :
CiscoRouter #config t
Enter configuration commands , one per line .
End with CNTL/Z .
CiscoRouter ( config ) #enable secret VisaGooglaSec
CiscoRouter ( config ) #end
CiscoRouter #
The preceding configuration sets the enable secret password to VisaGooglaSec .
The result of setting the enable secret password can be seen in the following output .
From the user mode prompt , you must enter the enable command to gain access into privileged mode , as follows :
CiscoRouter > enable
Password : VisaGooglaSec
CiscoRouter #
Note :
After you enter the enable command , the password you type at the password prompt will not be displayed .
Be sure to type the password exactly as it is configured in the enable password command .
Note :
For security reason , we recommend you to use " enable secret password " , because the secret password uses MD5 hashing function to encrypt your password , so it is more secure than " enable password " !!!
The commission said that it had no indications of the problems in the brachytherapy program when it arrived at the hospital and that its surveys are not detailed enough to have uncovered the flawed implants .
Soon after , the N.R.C. sent its own inspectors to Philadelphia .
And the more the inspectors looked , the more they found .
All told , 57 of the implants delivered too little radiation to the prostate , either because the seeds missed the prostate or were not distributed properly inside the prostate .
Thirty - five other cases involved overdoses to other parts of the body .
An unspecified number of patients were both underdosed in the prostate and overdosed elsewhere .
From December 2006 to November 2007 , the nuclear commission found , 16 patients received seed implants in Philadelphia even though computer interface problems prevented medical personnel from determining whether those treatments had been successful .
The V.A. ’s radiation officials knew of the problem but took no action , the nuclear commission charges .
Investigators said they did not know how the unit made so many mistakes or why Dr. Kao decided to rewrite only two surgical plans .
The doctors , according to the nuclear commission , believed “ that since the patients were not having complications , the implant quality must be acceptable . ”
The V.A. put too much trust in the contractors , said Darrell G. Wiedeman , a senior health physicist for the nuclear commission .
“ They claim they hired experts , the best that money could buy from the local university , so therefore they did n’t require a lot of training and oversight , ” Mr. Wiedeman said at a recent meeting of the nuclear commission ’s advisory board .
Susan Phillips , a senior executive at Penn ’s medical school and health system , said Dr. Kao had voluntarily given up his clinical privileges there , though he continues to do research on campus .
Dr. Kao did an unspecified number of brachytherapy procedures at the campus hospital with no apparent problems .
A check of state and federal records over the last decade in Pennsylvania turned up no malpractice or disciplinary actions against Dr. Kao .
Back in West Virginia , Pastor Flippin said he continued to try to build up his small church while dealing with the side effects of his implant .
After 21 years of serving his country , he had hoped for a better ending .
“ It ’s not fair , ” he said .
“ Any veteran should expect more than what we ’re getting . ”
Recently I was thinking about purely functional solutions to dynamic programming problems .
The problem with the conventional , imperative technique for solving such problems is that it assumes the existence of O ( 1 ) access arrays .
So translating the code directly using purely functional data structures is going to add an extra factor of log(n ) .
Originally this started out as a purely academic exercise since one can always use mutable arrays in Haskell .
However it turns out that there is a purely functional approach that is just as fast , and really quite elegant .
The Chain Matrix Multiplication Problem
I chose this to start with since its standard , and simple ( In all this I ’m going to assume you know the imperative solution .
If not here it is ) .
My initial idea was to do something like the following .
First consider the Fibonacci function :
fib 0 = 1 fib 1 = 1 fib n = fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 )
Everyone knows how slow this is .
But it ’s easy to speed up ( Edit : fixed ! ) :
fib n = fst $ foldl ( \a b -> ( fst a + snd a , fst a ) ) ( 1 , 0 ) [ 1..n ]
I was wondering if something similar could be done with chain matrix multiplication .
The idea is that although they are called random access arrays , the actual order of accesses is far from random !
So I wanted to see if , given the recursive solution , I could determine the order of accesses and use that to transform the recursive solution into a fold - like form .
For chain matrix multiplication , the order of accesses is something like this :
The value of a cell in the memo table depends on the minimum of the sums of the corresponding elements in the column below and the row to its left .
So you focus on a cell and the corresponding row and column .
You can calculate the value in the cell by zipping the corresponding row and column together with (+ ) , and taking the minimum .
Then you move to the next cell .
Now your focus must change to the appropriate row and column ( efficiently ! ) , using what is essentially a type of zipper
So I wrote a purely functional program in Haskell that juggled things appropriately so as to be O( n ^3 ) ( which is the time - complexity of the imperative version ) .
It can be done , and all you need are lists .
However the result is not very nice , because everything must fit together just so .
It works but its not really very satisfactory .
Now the juggling required for this problem is bad enough , but to make matters worse there would have to be a different solution to each DP problem .
Actually , things are much worse than that .
There will be some problems where the order of accesses will depend on the specific instance of the problem ( eg Job scheduling as long as the jobs are n’t all of unit time ) .
It is of course possible that even these can be transformed into a form where a strict , efficient , purely functional program can be written but it will certainly be far too messy a solution to what was once a simple problem .
Laziness
Notice how I snuck in the word “ strict ” in the previous sentence .
It turns out that in a lazy language , the solution is simple .
Because of the problems mentioned above , I started looking for alternatives .
If I wanted to solve the problem efficiently using just lists , I needed to regulate the order of accesses which seemed to be impossible .
So then I wondered if there might be a way of forming an acceptable data structure for arrays , or rather an alternative data structure that is “ good enough ” for the current problem .
It turns out that no fancy alternative is needed .
An immutable array will work just fine !
The key here is that even in the imperative world , we are writing to the array just once .
An immutable array can be “ written to ” once – when initializing it .
In a strict language this does n’t help much .
But with laziness you can build up an immutable array recursively .
I ’ll explain through an example .
Lets take fibonacci .
This is not usually considered a DP problem , but anyway :
fib n = fib ' n where memo = array ( 0 , n ) [ ( i , fib ' i ) | i <- [ 0..n ] ] fib ' 0 = 1 fib ' 1 = 1 fib ' i = memo ! ( i - 1 ) + memo !( i - 2 )
Notice that we never update the array .
It starts out with the correct values already !
Within fib ' I ’m using memo in place of the recursive calls to fib ' .
Each element of memo gets initialized to the correct value the first time its accessed .
If it ’s accessed more than once , then the other calls to memo !
i will return immediately , since the value has been calculated and stored already .
In effect , laziness is giving us a “ one - time - write ” array .
Now its trivial to extend this example to any recursive function .
Coming back to chain matrix multiplication :
matrix dim = matrix ' ( 1 , n ) where n = snd $ bounds dim memo = array ( ( 1,1 ) , ( n , n ) ) [ ( ( i , j ) , matrix ' ( i , j ) ) | i <- [ 1..n ] , j <- [ i..n ] ] matrix ' ( i , j ) |i == j = 0 |otherwise = foldl1 min [ memo ! ( i , k ) + ( dim ! ( i - 1 ) * dim !k * dim !j ) + memo !( k+1 , j ) | k <- [ i.. j - 1 ] ]
Here dim is an array containing matrix dimensions so that the dimensions of the i’th matrix are dim ! ( i - 1 ) x dim !i .
Moral !
When solving a DP problem , the usual technique is to first write a recursive solution , and then convert it into an efficient solution by building up a table of intermediate values .
The cool thing about the technique I described above is that the second step of this process becomes trivial .
The solution is just a memoized version of the recursive solution , and hence easier to understand than the usual imperative solution ( you can compare on wikipedia ) .
The memoization is almost implicit .
There is no need to check whether a value has been computed or not .
We just use it , and laziness handles the rest .
The transformation from basic recursive to memoized is also a simple one .
In fact it should n’t be hard to automate this transformation ( perhaps in Template Haskell ) , but even manually this is easy and gives a nice , clean solution .
Of course , I ’m sure people have thought of this before , but it seemed new to me because I think deep down I ’m still stuck in a “ strict ” mindset .
Hopefully it was just as non-obvious to people reading this !
For me it was a reminder that some very cool things are possible in lazy languages once you start grokking them .

The things we never want to see you ever ever do again on the subway …
1/ Next time we come across one more kid selling chocolate for his basketball team so he can stay clean and out of jail we will throw up on the kid and refuse to pay for any chocolate that we end up taking then and there .
2 / We never ever want to see you pick your nose and pretend no one is looking , especially us .
3 / You shall never ever start screaming at each other from one end of the subway car to the other , no matter how ‘ fantastic ’ you are .
4 / You shall never ever stand five inches within us if you have yet to have taken a shower that day .
5 / You shall never stand or sit next to us if you intend to bore us with your exploits and other ‘ pointless ’ discussions that mean nothing to us .
We hate people who are secretly trying to impress us - we are never impressed , especially if we did n’t invite you to impress us , and please we do n’t care if you think your boyfriend is cheating on you .
6 / You shall never ever offer to feed us if we are hungry while at the same time asking for ‘ donations . ’
We are fed up with this scam .
If you need to feed someone who is hungry we doubt you will find them at 8.45 am on the number 6 line , seriously …
7 / You shall never ever mention how you missed out on booking the “ Vogue ” cover or how you just made a $ 2 million bonus .
You do n’t need to try to impress us since we are better looking and wealthier than you in the first place .
8 / You shall never spread your legs as if they were remnants of the Grand Canyon while the rest of us breathe threw straws just to be seated .
9 / You shall never ever try to look or start a conversation with us unless you are absolutely convinced you are absolutely intriguing and even then we want you to think twice .
10 / You will never ever again in your whole life drink black coffee out of your thermo as if you were in your living room - it is gauche and an eyesore !
This is still technically in the “ rumor ” stage right now , but Collider.com is reporting that an “ inside source ” has told them that the dearly departed series Futurama has received a 13 - episode order from Comedy Central .
Originally cancelled by Fox in 2003 , the animated series has had a second life over the past couple of years , with four DVD releases and heavy syndication on Comedy Central .
Like we said , no official word yet , though we ’ve been hearing rumblings of this news for a couple of weeks now .
When we spoke to series co-creator Matt Groening this past March , he maintained a “ wait and see ” attitude :
AVC : When will you have a better idea if you are coming back ?
MG : Maybe the next phone call I get ?
I do n’t know .
[ Laughs . ]
We ’re not holding our breath .
It ’s always tough in television , because it is much safer to say no .
If you say yes , it is going to cost a lot of money , especially with animation , so I understand the hesitation .
On the other hand , what we do is very good , and the fans really love it , and the DVDs have been very lucrative for Fox .
I think they should do some more .
If they ’re smart , they ’ll do more .

Hopefully we ’ll get official confirmation soon .
Stay tuned !
( EDIT : It 's confirmed .
And it 's actually for 26 episodes ! )
The Skinny House – Boston , Massachusetts
Dr. John Tyler
Falloon v. Schilling
We could n't find a picture of the Schilling / Falloon spite house , so here is a picture of a cute puppy
The Hollensbury Spite House
For as good as humans can be , we have a far greater capacity to be angry and vengeful .
This vengeance takes many forms ; some kill , some cheat , some will glue your butt cheeks together while you sleep .
But few go as far as erecting a building as a monument to their anger toward another .
This , friends , is what is called a spite house .
It does n't matter if a spite house is pretty much an unlivable waste of space , that 's beside the point .
They 're all about draining tons of cash and time in to a building that may as well be shaped like a hand giving you the middle finger with a pair of testicles hanging off of the wrist .
The history of this spite house is a little shaky , but the largely accepted version of the story is the one we 'll tell you .
It was 1874 , and two brothers that were not fond of one - another were left a plot of land by their dead father .
When one of the brothers went off to join the military , the other took his brothers ' sense of duty and patriotism as an opportunity to screw him over .
When The Solider came back , he found a house covered most of the land his father had left him .
The keyword here is most .
The military brother , so enraged by his brother 's actions , used what little money he had left to build a home on the tiny remaining strip of land ; a strip of land that the first brother thought was useless .
The house – now known as The Skinny House – is 10 feet long at its widest point .
It has no front door , but rather , a cramped staircase located at the side of the building that can only be reached via a sliver of an alleyway .
Dr. John
Tyler was a fine , upstanding man .
He was a prominent ophthalmologist ( basically , an optometrist that treats diseases and performs surgeries ) , and was the first American - born doctor to perform a cataract operation .
He owned a piece of land in Frederick , Maryland that the city wanted to pave over in order to connect Record Street to West Patrick Street .
Dr. Tyler fought the city over the right to the land that he rightfully owned , but they did n't care .
They were going to do it anyway .
At the 11hour , Tyler came upon a town law that did not allow for the construction of a road if there was already something being built there ; something “ substantial . ”
As soon as he discovered this , Tyler hired a group of workers who immediately began digging and cementing .
Come the next morning , when road crews came to survey the area , they discovered the foundation for what would be a house smack - dab in the middle of what would be their road .
The crew left , the matter was settled , and Tyler built his house , which still stands today as a bed and breakfast .
One thing to keep in mind when reading this story is that it all of its events went down in 1880 and in Kansas .
1880 and Kansas .
It 'll make sense later .
It was the town of Hiawatha , Kansas in the year 1880 where a man by the name of Adam Schilling owned 80 acres of land .
Mr. Schilling sold off three - quarters of an acre of this land , and a house was built upon it .
This house was occupied by a one James Falloon , along with his wife and two young children .
This 80 acres worth of land had yet to be officially integrated in to the rapidly expanding town of Hiawatha , and Mr. Schilling was more than willing to fork over the entire plot for the sake of the town .
The problem , of course , was getting Mr. Falloon and his family to go along with it .
Schilling offered Falloon $ 1,600 for the three - quarters of an acre that he once owned .
Falloon refused , claiming that the land was really worth somewhere in the $ 1,900 - $ 2,000 range .
Schilling , apparently not one for haggling , decided that enough was enough ; that if this Falloon jackass and his bratty kids did n't want to accept money out of his hand , they were going to have to deal with the consequences .
Schilling built his own tenement house just 13 feet away from Falloon 's house .
A spite house , indeed .
But it does n't end there .
If you read about this little story on Wikipedia , you 'll read this line pulled directly from the Kansas Supreme Court opinion regarding the legal dispute between Falloon and Schilling : “ oppressive and unlawful idea of rendering Falloon 's home obnoxious and unendurable to Falloon and family .
” Yes , it 's a sentence that is a bit fractured .
But , if you read the entire sentence , as written in the actual court opinion , you 'll understand why the Wikipedia editors elected to leave out some bits :
“ Thereupon defendant conceived the oppressive and unlawful idea of rendering plaintiff 's home obnoxious and unendurable to himself and family by erecting cheap tenement houses on either side of plaintiff 's land and filling them with worthless negros that they might annoy plaintiff 's wife who is a person in delicate health and thereby punish plaintiff for refusing defendant 's inadequate for the property .
” But , wait !
There 's more !
“ The building is rented to a negro family but that family is the family of a preacher , and well behaved .
It can not therefore be said that defendant is filling his buildings with worthless negroes .
” The court ruled in favor of Schilling .
Again , 1880 and Kansas .
Some people live on luxurious and expansive plots of land out in the country where they can finally get some solace from the hectic and noisy city life .
Other , more unfortunate fellows live next to a raging cacophony of street urchins , vagabonds and enough horse traffic to ensure that their droppings can safely fertilize a forest of Sequoias .
So what does one do when the home they refuse to leave is situated right next to an alleyway that may as well be occupied by a 24 - hour death metal mosh pit ?
That was the question that Alexandria , Virginia resident John Hollensbury had to face in 1830 .
His answer , as you might guess , was to cut off their noses to spites their big , stupid faces … metaphorically speaking , of course .
Hollensbury took it upon himself to build a 7 foot wide , 25 foot deep home that bridged the gap between his home and the home of his neighbor , effectively cutting off all traffic within the alleyway .
The home is a cramped 2 story building that uses the exterior walls of the two neighboring homes as its interior walls .
The building still stands to this day and it is currently being occupied by a married couple and their son that have never fixed the damage inflicted upon their interior walls by horse - drawn carriages nearly 2 centuries ago .
( CNN ) --
He wo n't look me in the eye , wo n't engage in any small talk , and looks more ill at ease than I feel .
CNN 's Nic Robertson , left , talks to Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid at an undisclosed location .
The man in front of me is Zabiullah Mujahid -- one of two spokesmen for the Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar .
He is around 30 , maybe a little younger , bearded , but not heavily so .
He is slight but not weak and close to my height -- a little over six foot -- and meeting him is a big deal .
I 've never taken meetings with Taliban officials lightly , but the stakes are getting higher these days .
They kidnap reporters and worse , and just before our interview they had announced a new offensive against U.S. and NATO troops .
Frankly just getting into this room had put my heart rate up a good few beats .
On top of that , Mujahid almost never gives TV interviews .
He has answers to questions every journalist covering this conflict wants to know .
He is also a wanted man .
I 'd been waiting for him for about 15 minutes .
We 'd agreed to meet at this safe house on the condition I did not report its location .
As we approached I 'd seen several men talking on mobile phones on street corners watching us very closely .
It 's clear the Taliban do n't trust us not to have sold him out .
The room is small with two doors :
One to a tiny hole - in - the - ground toilet under the stairs the other , the only way in and out .
A red carpet runs wall to wall and matching pillows ring the room .
The only furniture is a chair , a small table and a computer .
Watch as CNN's Nic Robertson meets Taliban spokesman »
When we first arrive the man minding the room has a pistol by his side .
We follow his lead and sit backs to the wall propped up on the cushions and wait .
I 'm expecting to hear a convoy of cars pulling up , but nothing , silence .
Then a whisper :
He is coming .
There is no time to wonder what 's going to happen .
He steps in alone , no sound of a car .
He is nervous and seems in a hurry , telling me I only have 15 minutes .
It could take me that long to ask just half my questions , never mind his answers .
I want the interview to last .
I want to get the most out of it .
I want to put him at ease so he wants to stay and talk .
My first question is simple :
What 's your strategy ?
He tells me the policy is clear .
" We ask from the beginning and we say once again one to enforce the Sharia law and Islamic government in Afghanistan , and to remove foreign forces remove from our country . "
He tells me presidential elections expected this year are a sham , that the Taliban are telling Afghans to stay away and he warns :
" We will target the Afghan parliamentary members and government officials so if there is elections , yes it is clear we will target them . "
He says they 'll use suicide bombers in their attacks .
I want to know how they justify tactics that kill so many civilians .
I find his answer falls far short of even trying to explain let alone apologize for the carnage they cause .
He says it is justified in Islam , it has its roots in history and Islam 's Prophet Mohammed .
That 's not what most Muslims I talk to say ; they abhor such nihilistic thinking .
I want to ask more , to probe and push , even question his morality , but to do so would , at the very least , drive the interview in to a cul de sac and waste valuable time when there is still so much more I want answered .
He could even get up and leave and we'd be left guessing about their plans for the future and the possibilities for peace .
Nic Robertson : " Should he choose he could pull a weapon on me and there would be little I could do . "
It 's also about now , as we are sitting just a few inches apart on the floor , that I realize he has gun holsters under his loose fitting waistcoat .
I can't see if they are full or empty but it reinforces the notion that should he choose he could pull a weapon on me and there would be little I could do .
I found out later an armor plate protects his back .
A couple of sources on the Afghan conflict have been keeping me informed of back channel talks aimed at bringing peace and splitting the Taliban from al Qaeda .
In September last year the first face - to - face meeting between Afghan officials and Taliban representatives got under way in Mecca , Saudi Arabia .
My sources had told me Mullah Omar had let it be known the Taliban recognized they will not win the war by military means alone .
This was my first chance for feedback direct from the Taliban .
Mujahid affirmed that is the Taliban 's position .
" We believe by both ... by negotiation and also by war ... we ask them to leave the country we are ready to talk ... so they are not ready to leave so they want to talk by the mouth of the gun we will talk by the mouth of the gun . "
Zabiullah Mujahid : " Let the Afghan people to do what they want to do , like form the Islamic government they want to establish . "
I 'd also been told if the talks were to continue the Taliban needed to show a commitment to break from al Qaeda .
What they had done , I was told , was to tell their fighters to avoid civilian casualties .
When I asked Mujahid he told me that policy had n't changed .
In their newly announced battle plans to target Afghan officials as well as U.S. and NATO troops he told me " we ask of the civilians do n't be close to the troops ; be away from them ; not to be targeted . "
I ask what are the conditions for going into talks ?
" Our conditions are clear , we want to negotiate and they [ the U.S. ] will not interfere in our affairs , secondly they [ the U.S. ] will leave the country , third let the Afghan people to do what they want to do , like form the Islamic government they want to establish . "
From what my sources tell me , the talks seem stalled or at the very least to have sunk to a very low level .
The Taliban do n't just want U.S. troops to leave Afghanistan , they want them out before talks can even begin .
Always with negotiations , I 've learned the key is in working out the sequencing .
Mujahid confirms my suspicions and what I hear from my sources is that the talks are bogged down .
He says the former Taliban officials who have been at the talks so far do n't represent Mullah Omar .
He said when " we want to talk , it will be clear , our representatives ' names will be clear , we will announce [ it to ] the people . "
My gut and my sources tell me he may not be telling me everything .
For Mullah Omar to be in talks with President Karzai 's western - backed government would be tantamount to suicide right now , not least from al Qaeda who do n't believe in any form of negotiation .
It 's one of the defining factors that sets the two groups apart .
I ask Mujahid about their links .
" We are not under the command of al Qaeda : some people are coming to fight and we say welcome . "
On the issue of who is in charge he is emphatic : " We are from the country [ Afghanistan ] we are the boss , we not have any link with them they not have any link with us . "
Zabiullah Mujahid : " We are not under the command of al Qaeda : some people are coming to fight and we say welcome . "
Interestingly , this is much different to Iraq where al Qaeda in the guise of Abu Musab al Zarqawi and others came from outside and dominated the insurgency , overrunning the inexperienced local insurgents , for several years .
The Taliban are smarter , and have a longer history of armed guerilla conflict .
Plus they are not as ideologically close to al Qaeda as some may think .
Not long after 9/11 , one senior Taliban official told me Osama bin Laden was a pain in the backside .
Hard to control , intent on doing his own thing .
The only reason they did n't turn him over was out of fearsome ethnic tribal loyalty known as Pashtunwali .
Bin Laden and Mullah Omar are at opposite ends of the ultra - conservative corner of Islam they occupy .
Not natural bedfellows .
All this is going through my head as I 'm sitting there inwardly urging him to give me more time .
I want to branch off and explore these theories .
Several times he asks , is that it ?
But I push on .
He wants to talk about the Taliban 's response to the imminent arrival of 20,000 more U.S. troops .
He tells me it does n't matter how many come , they wo n't win .
" If the Pentagon is thinking of changing its policy , we too are thinking of changing the policy .
If they want to send 20,000 to start a new campaign , this is a war and we will see the war and make our policy . "
At one point he laughs when I say he is up against the strongest army in the world .
His point is Taliban fighters are not afraid of dying .
" If they want to send the troops and change things ... we believe they can't do anything .
" Afghanistan will be the Vietnam for them , concerning their policy , it is the same Bush policy .
There no changes in this policy .
I want to tell you clearly we will win , and they will die . "
I know he is telling me what he wants me to believe , but he pushes the boundaries of credibility when he tells me the Taliban make no money from the country 's $ 300 million illegal opium poppy crops .
Zabiullah Mujahid : " Afghanistan will be the Vietnam for them ... I want to tell you clearly we will win , and they will die . "
He points out when the Taliban were in government they eradicated the narcotic plants , something I saw and reported on almost a decade ago , but the facts speak differently today .
Where the Taliban are strongest the opium harvests are the heaviest .
Even before he gets up I can tell he 's been getting ready to leave for quite some time , not only asking if this is the last question but looking more and more agitated again .
He 'd given me 15 minutes initially but as he'd relaxed he let the time run on to almost 45 minutes , but clearly does n't want to take any chance that our interview has been an elaborate cover - up to snatch him .
Almost as soon as he 's gone we 're encouraged to wrap it up and get out fast too .
We were n't attacked or kidnapped on the way in ; the next most likely time would be on the way out .
I 'd had three hours sleep the night before , and not much more the nights before that too .
Adrenaline has kept me going , focused , sharp , alert to the dangers and the myriad questions I 'd planned .
The further away we get , the more I can let my guard down , the more I can reflect on what was said .
Was it worth it ?
Yes .
Without their voice we are all fighting in the dark .

While millions of Americans suffer from heartburn and gastric reflux , only a small number develop more severe ailments that can lead to esophageal cancer .
Scientists trying to understand what may protect against these conditions have identified an unlikely agent : wine .
Two studies published this month in the journal Gastroenterology suggest that people who drink wine , white or red , in moderation are less likely to develop conditions that may lead to esophageal adenocarcinoma , an uncommon cancer that has increased sharply in the United States over the past 30 years .
The reports are particularly surprising because alcohol intake is a well - established risk factor for the other main form of esophageal cancer , squamous cell carcinoma .
Researchers noted the studies were preliminary .
In one study , researchers at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland , Calif. , found that drinking a glass of wine a day was associated with a more than 50 percent reduction in the risk of developing Barrett ’s esophagus , though there was no reduction in risk among adults who drank liquor or beer .
Barrett ’s esophagus , an erosion of the esophageal lining that can be caused by chronic heartburn or acid reflux , increases the odds of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma 30 - fold to 40 - fold .
Two Colombian Generals Face Charges Editor ’s Note :
Over the decades , U.S. - trained military officers from a variety of Latin American countries have been linked to a wide range of crimes , from mass murders and torture to drug trafficking and money - laundering .
Now , that list has grown by two more , as writer Sherwood Ross reports in this guest essay : Two Colombian generals , both of whom received training at the U.S. Army 's " School of The Americas " ( SOA ) at Ft. Benning , Ga. , have been accused by authorities there of crimes involving narcotics and collaborating with criminal paramilitary groups , according to a report in the June 15th issue of The Nation magazine .
Email
Printer friendly Brig .
Gen. Pauxelino Latorre has been charged " with laundering millions of dollars for a paramilitary drug ring , and prosecutors say they are looking into his activities as head of the Seventeenth Brigade , " investigative journalist Teo Ballve reports , noting that criminal probes repeatedly linked Latorre ’s unit " to illegal paramilitary groups that had brutally killed thousands " of Colombian farmers in an effort to seize their land for palm oil production .
Another general , Rito Alejo Del Rio , former Seventeenth Brigade leader , is in jail on charges of collaborating with paramilitaries , gangs that have been responsible for widespread atrocities .
He also received training at SOA .
Various firms engaged in palm oil development since 2002 apparently have received $ 75 million in U.S. Agency for International Development money under " Plan Colombia , " Ballve writes .
And some of the firms appear to be tied to narco - traffickers , " in possible violation of federal law . "
The writer notes Colombia 's paramilitaries are on the State Department 's list of foreign " terrorist " organizations .
" Plan Colombia is fighting against drugs militarily at the same time it gives money to support palm , which is used by paramilitary mafias to launder money , " The Nation quotes Colombian Senator Gustavo Petro , as saying .
" The United States is implicitly subsidizing drug traffickers . "
President Alvaro Uribe has urged Colombians to increase palm production from 750,000 to 15 million acres to cash in on the expected boom in biofuels .
" Oil palm , or African palm , is one of the few aid - funded crops whose profits can match coca profits , " Ballve notes .
But human rights groups have long accused palm companies , notably Urapalma , of cultivating stolen lands , he adds .
Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , has attached an amendment to this year 's Plan Colombia funding ( for 2010 ) to ban palm projects that " cause the forced displacement of local people " but in the bill 's current draft , Ballve says , Leahy 's amendment is marked for deletion .
Urapalma submitted a grant application to the Bogota , Colombia , offices of ARD Inc. , a rural development contractor based in Burlington , Vermont , which The Nation reports does business in 43 countries and has received $ 330 million in revenue from USAID .
In January , 2003 , ARD began administering $ 41.5 million for USAID 's Colombia Agribusiness Partnership Program and Urapalma was one of its beneficiaries .
Urapalma has been accused of taking land illegally from Colombian peasants .
In July , 2003 , just before Urapalma 's USAID application , Colombia 's national daily El Tiempo reported that " the African palm projects in the southern banana region of Uraba are dripping with blood , misery , and corruption . "
The region is where Urapalma is active .
The Nation article goes on to report that in 2003 , the Inter - American Court of Human Rights singled out Urapalma for collusion with paramilitaries in these words : " Since 2001 , the company Urapalma SA has initiated cultivation of the oil palm on approximately 1,500 hectares of the collective land of these communities , with the help of ' the perimetric and concentric armed protection of the Army 's Seventeenth Brigade and armed civilians ' " , i.e. , paras .
All of the above , of course , has gone on by fleecing American taxpayers , courtesy of SOA and USAID .

“ We all remember this time last year , ” said Senator Roger Wicker , R- Miss . , at a hearing on Capitol Hill on Monday .
“ We were in the midst of an energy crisis , paying $ 4 for a gallon of gasoline , and Americans were seeing their utility bills skyrocketing . ”
Since then , he went on to say , the energy problems have n’t disappeared and no changes in policy have been made .
He warned that , though the prices have gone down , if we do not make any changes , we will fall into the same hole in which we found ourselves last summer .
His solution ?
Nuclear .
Stating that “ the cornerstone of any real solution to the American energy problem needs to involve offshore resources and nuclear power … which generates electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions and has a minimal impact on the environment . ”
The first step to escaping America ’s current energy crisis according to Wicker is to build more nuclear power plants .
The construction of such plants would generate jobs , which would stimulate the economy .
The Nuclear Energy Institute estimates that building 45 new nuclear plants in America will generate up to 128,000 construction jobs and create up to 32,000 high paying permanent jobs .
The benefits , then , of nuclear power would not only be escaping the energy crisis , but escaping the economic crisis as well .
Because of the said benefits , Wicker “ fully support[s ] the call for 100 nuclear reactors by the year 2030 . ”
He called this goal aggressive because the United States has n’t built a nuclear plant in 30 years .
He stressed the fact that the U.S. needs to hop aboard the nuclear cruise ship into energy comfort by stating that Japan has a goal to built one nuclear plant per year and China currently has 24 nuclear plants underway .
Senator Wicker agreed that alternative “ green ” energy needs to be developed , but claims that those sources are insufficient and that they can only provide for a fraction of our energy needs .
He called for a more “ balanced ” approach to meeting our energy needs , and feels that going nuclear is a plan on which all Americans could come together .
This comes at a time when a debate rages over energy ; one side is pulling for 100 nuclear power plants while the other side is calling for a “ cap and trade ” energy tax , which Wicker calls “ very risky ” and “ ill - advised . ”
What , then , is the answer ?
Is a dependence on nuclear energy the most efficient way to free ourselves from the current energy crisis ?
Or is it a tax plan ?
Perhaps neither , and perhaps both .

ATLANTA - A federal judge ruled Thursday that airlines and other companies in the industry that are being sued by families of terrorism victims can't question FBI agents about the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The defendants wanted to depose the agents and sought access to other evidence related to the investigation of the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in order to show at trial that the government 's failure to catch the terrorists and prevent the attacks mitigates and excuses any alleged fault on the aviation companies ' part .
The government objected .
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said the defendants have also argued that the terrorists likely would have succeeded even if the defendants had exercised due care .
" The issues to be tried relate to the acts and omissions of the aviation defendants , not the government , " Hellerstein wrote in his ruling .
" The government 's failures to detect and abort the terrorists ' plots would not affect the aviation defendants ' potential liability . "
There was no immediate comment from the defendants or their lawyers .
Spokespersons for UAL Corp.'s United Airlines , AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and US Airways Group Inc. declined to comment .
Lawyers for several airlines did not immediately return calls seeking comment .
Other defendants include Delta Air Lines Inc. , Continental Airlines Inc. , AirTran Airways , Boeing Co. and several airport authorities and security companies .
The judge said he plans to set a trial date for the lawsuits involving three wrongful death cases and 19 property damage cases on July 28 .
Many relatives of victims of the attacks received money from a special national fund established to compensate victims ' families , though some relatives chose to sue instead .
The lawsuits claim negligence on the part of the defendants and seek to recover damages for injuries and fatalities , property damage and business loss that occurred as a result of the attacks .
According to court papers , the plaintiffs have alleged or have indicated they are likely to allege that the aviation companies should have anticipated that terrorists would hijack planes and crash them into buildings in coordinated suicide attacks , and that the defendants should have put in place security procedures to effectively defend against such attacks .
The government urged the judge to block the aviation companies from interviewing six current and former FBI employees who the companies say would be able to testify as to what intelligence the FBI , CIA , Federal Aviation Administration and airlines had before the attacks regarding the terrorists ' plans and capabilities , as well as how the entities shared and exploited the intelligence .
The government argued that it would be impossible to interview the employees without disclosing classified or privileged material that could cause serious damage to national security and interfere with pending law enforcement proceedings .
The largest investigation in FBI history has resulted in 167,000 interviews and more than 155,000 pieces of evidence and involved the pursuit of 500,000 investigative leads , the government noted .
The government said the FBI has turned over more than 33,000 pages of information to the aviation industry lawyers , including more than 10,000 pages of laboratory pictures and related information , witness interviews and descriptions of the hijackers ' weapons .
The airlines and aviation companies have said they are defending themselves against lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in damages for injuries , fatalities , property damage and business losses related to the attacks .
The companies filed separate lawsuits against the CIA and the FBI seeking to force terrorism investigators to say whether the aviation industry was to blame for the Sept. 11 attacks .
Lawyers for the victims of the attacks have said the FBI should not be forced to provide more information .
In Thursday 's ruling , the judge also denied the aviation defendants ' motion for an order that the 9/11 commission 's report as a whole , a staff monograph and selected staff statements , are relevant to the lawsuits .
He said specific portions of the report may be admissible .
As to a motion by the defendants seeking to have testimony given by FBI agents during the trial of Sept. 11 conspirator Zacharias Moussaoui admitted in the lawsuits case , the judge granted the motion only as to the testimony of two agents in which they recount what they learned in their investigations .
" Testimony as to what their superiors did or did not do is not relevant , and is not admissible , " the judge wrote .
Moussaoui , a French citizen , is serving a life sentence after pleading guilty to helping plan the attacks .
A fáradékonyság az egyik leggyakoribb ok , amivel a betegek az orvoshoz fordulnak .
Minden ötödik ember szokatlan mértékben érzi magát fáradtnak , és minden tizedik ember szenved krónikus fáradtságban .
Bármelyik korosztályt érintheti , bár gyermek- és időskorban kevésbé gyakori .
Fáradtságunk hátterében különböző okok állhatnak :
Súlyproblémák
Túlsúllyal küzdünk , vagy túl soványak vagyunk .
Bármelyikről legyen szó , komoly megterhelést jelenthet a napi tevékenységek elvégzése .
Bővebben Bővebben az elhízásról
Krónikus betegségek
Bármelyik komolyabb betegség képes fáradékonyságot okozni , különösen azok , amelyek fájdalommal járnak .
Daganatos megbetegedések , cukorbetegség , vérszegénység , a pajzsmirigyet érintő betegségek gyakran járnak fáradékonysággal .
Hirdetés
Bizonyos gyógyszerek - mint például a béta - blokkolók , vagy erős fájdalomcsillapítók , vízhajtók - szedése , daganatos betegségek terápiája során alkalmazott sugár - vagy kemoterápia ugyancsak fáradékonysággal jár .
Kismamák
Várandósság és szoptatás alatt is fáradékonyabbnak érezhetjük magunkat .
Pszichés terhek
Ha úgy gondoljuk , hogy olyan problémáink vannak , melyeket nem tudunk megoldani , szintén okozhat fáradékonyságot .
A magunkkal szemben állított túl magas elvárások eleve magukban hordozzák a kudarcot , amely frusztrációhoz és kimerültséghez vezethet .
Ha nem érezzük , hogy mi kontrolláljuk az életünket , gyakran érezzük magunkat frusztráltnak és fáradtnak .
Alvászavarok
Ha hosszú időn keresztül nem alszunk jól , fáradttá , ingerlékennyé válunk .
Depresszióban szenved ő emberek gyakran a korai órákban felébrednek , mely fokozza fáradtságukat .
Ha napközben rendszeresen alszunk , akkor sem tudunk este elaludni .
Bővebben Bővebben az alvászavarokról
Rendszertelen élet
Ha széls őségesen gyorsan - naponta - váltogatjuk a megterhelő tevékenységet a teljes pihenéssel , akkor pihenés során sokkal fáradtabbnak érezhetjük magunkat .
Elsőre furcsán hangozhat , de a túl sok alvás is vezethet fáradékonysághoz .
Éjszakai műszakban dolgozók könnyen érzik magukat fáradtnak .
Ez még valószínűbb , ha a műszakbeosztásuk gyakran változik .
Élénkítők
Pár csésze kávé vagy tea egy nap elegend ő ahhoz , hogy egy egészséges ember alvását megzavarja .
Az este során elfogyasztott alkohol okozhat hajnali felébredést .
Hogyan tudjuk csökkenteni a fáradékonyságunkat ?
1. Javítsunk az alvásunkon !
Feküdjünk le aludni és keljünk reggel mindig azonos időpontokban , függetlenül attól , hogy eleinte hogyan érezzük magunkat !
Legyen a hálószobánk komfortos : nem túl meleg , nem túl hideg és főleg nem túl zajos .
Ne együnk vagy igyunk késő este !
Próbáljuk meg csökkenteni a napközben szunyókálással töltött időt !
Ha nem tudunk aludni , ne feküdjünk az ágyban ezen aggódva , hanem keljünk fel , csináljunk valamit , ami megnyugtat , elálmosít , és ha elég fáradtak vagyunk , akkor feküdjünk le újra !
Válasszunk lefekvés előtt valamilyen relaxáló elfoglaltságot : olvassunk , halgassunk zenét vagy alkalmazzunk valamilyen relaxációs technikát .
Vegyünk egy jó forró fürdőt elalvás előtt !
Ha lehet , legalább 20 percig tartson .
Ha ezek közül semmi sem működik , forduljunk orvoshoz !
2. Mozogjunk !
Bár sok ember érzi úgy , képtelen mozgást iktatni életébe , hosszú távon sokat segíthet , hiszen energikusabbnak érezzük magunkat .
3. Csökkentsük a napi koffein mennyiséget !
Próbáljuk meg csökkenteni a koffeintartalmú italok fogyasztását .
Vigyázzunk , nemcsak a kávé és tea tartalmaz koffeint , de energiaitalok , kólák , egyes fájdalomcsillapítók is lehetnek koffeintartalmúak .
Próbáljuk meg csökkenteni a naponta elfogyasztott csokoládé mennyiségét is , hiszen a csokoládé is tartalmaz különböző stimuláló hatású anyagokat .
4. Oldjuk meg súlyproblémánkat !
5. Tervezzük meg a napunkat , hetünket !
Támasszunk reális elvárásokat magunkkal szemben , ezáltal elkerülhetjük , hogy túlvállaljuk magunkat !
Mindannyian szeretnénk egy mágikus megoldást , hogy eltűnjön a fáradtságunk .
A rossz hír , hogy nincs ilyen .
Elég sok olyan termék van a piacon , ami ezt ígéri , de ne hagyjuk félrevezetni magunkat !
Mindig gondoljunk arra , hogy valamilyen betegség állhat a háttérben : pajzsmirigyproblémák , vérszegénység , alvási apnoe ( néhány pillanatra megáll a légzés alvás közben ) , idegesség , depresszió lehet a háttérben .
Ezek megállapításához elengedhetetlen az orvosi közreműködés .

MONTREAL --
The NHL 's salary cap for next season will be $ 56.8 million , the league announced on Friday .
The figure is a mere $ 100,000 increase from the cap total of last season .
Numbers crunchers from the NHL and the NHL Players ' Association finalized the figure for the next season Thursday in New York .
The lower limit for next season is set at $ 40.8 million .
The cap has risen for a fifth consecutive season since its implementation in 2005 .
The salary cap debuted at $ 39 million for the 2005 - 06 season , the first season coming out of the lockout .
It rose to $ 44 million for 2006 - 07 and to $ 50.3 million in 2007 - 08 .
Pierre LeBrun covers the NHL for ESPN.com .
The newspaper has been losing millions each year Members of the largest union at the Boston Globe have voted by nearly two to one to accept pay cuts in an attempt to save the struggling newspaper .
The Boston Newspaper Guild 's decision will enable the 137 - year - old paper to save $ 10 m a year .
The Globe 's owner , the New York Times , wants to sell the loss - making title .
Analysts say the pay and benefit cuts approved by the union may make the newspaper a more attractive purchase for potential buyers .
" It has been a long and difficult period for everyone and we hope that we can now work with prospective buyers to help the Boston Globe carry on with its vital mission to promote good journalism and protect free speech , " said BNG head Dan Totten .
Under the agreement , workers will see their pay cut by almost 6 % , and other benefits will be reduced and a pension freeze introduced .
The Globe 's owner , the New York Times , had imposed a 23 % pay cut after the union rejected an earlier proposal in June , which would have cut pay by 8 % .
Millions lost Following Monday 's vote , a Boston Globe spokesman said " we deeply appreciate the sacrifices that guild members are making " .
The Boston Globe is among the best - known newspapers in the US The Globe , one of the oldest big -city US newspapers , lost $ 50 m last year and is expected to lose $ 85 m this year .
The New York Times bought the Boston Globe in 1993 for $ 1.1bn , but the current value of the title is estimated to be no more than $ 250 m .
Three potential bidders are reportedly interested in buying the newspaper .
The Boston Globe is the latest title to find itself squeezed by falling sales , rising costs and declining advertising revenues .
Traditional papers also face stiff competition from websites offering news content for free and other sites luring away classified advertisers .
At least 12,500 jobs have been lost in US print journalism in the past two years .

During the Qualcomm Technologies press conference in Taipei earlier today , we spotted an upcoming prototype Eee PC which was quite a bit if difference from the norm .
The machine was installed with Google 's upcoming Android operating system and we have to admit , it felt a bit strange on a " Smartbook " ( as Qualcomm calls them ) of this kind .
The operating system is clearly suited for smaller devices and smart phones , but it was nice to get a look at it anyway .
Operation was rather smooth and everything worked , albeit just a bit plain .
We asked one of the product managers from Qualcomm to give us a demo of the system .
It is based on Qualcomm 's Snapdragon platform which consists of a 1GHz CPU .
Because of the platforms " extremely low power consumption " , no cooling is required which allows for ultra thin netbooks .
It is capable of playing back 720 p video with the current gen chips , and in the future 1080 p will be supported with the faster clock processors .
Watch the video we recorded :
These products are not quite in mass production yet , but the chip company who is looking to give Intel , AMD and NVIDIA a run for its money said that it is working with some 15 Taiwanese companies who are working on designs using their processor and chipset technology .
Novell has launched a new Web service called SUSE Studio that simplifies the process of building Linux - based software appliances .
It provides a convenient interface for creating custom versions of Novell 's SUSE Linux distribution with specialized configurations .
The service is part of Novell 's broader SUSE Appliance Program initiative .
Enterprise software deployment comes with a lot of serious technical challenges .
Getting a complex piece of server software up and running on backend infrastructure often requires system administrators to wrestle with dependencies and configuration issues .
Software appliances are increasingly viewed as a compelling solution to this problem .
A software appliance is a preconfigured stack that includes a software program and its dependencies bundled with a minimal operating system image that can get the program up and running with the smallest possible resource footprint .
This concept is often referred to as " Just Enough Operating System " ( JeOS ) .
SUSE Studio allows users to build software appliances on top of SUSE Enterprise Linux or OpenSUSE .
It offers several templates that can be used as a starting point , including a minimal JeOS template , a server template , a minimal X11 , KDE , and GNOME templates .
After selecting a base template , users can customize it and add additional software .
SUSE Studio can output software appliances in several formats , making it easy to generate images that can be deployed on physical hardware , virtualized environments , or cloud computing services .
It can build virtual disks in the standard formats supported by VMware and Xen , it can generate ISO files for making installable Live CDs , and it can generate raw disk images that can be written directly to physical hard drives or removable media such as USB thumb drives and SD cards .
Novell says that support for Amazon EC2 images is coming soon .
SUSE Studio provides a simple and elegant Web interface for customizing the software that is bundled in the distro image .
Users can browse and search the official SUSE repositories and select individual packages that they wish to add .
SUSE Studio will automatically compute the required dependencies and include those too .
Users can also add additional third - party repositories or upload their own SUSE - compatible RPM files .
As you add and remove packages , you will be able to see the disk footprint of the appliance .
This is particularly useful when building images for USB thumb drives or netbooks with limited drive capacity .
In addition to being able to select custom package sets , users can also upload their own files and specify where those should reside on the generated filesystem .
These are applied as an overlay , so it 's possible to selectively overwrite files that are included in various packages .
SUSE Studio provides a dashboard for customizing the appliance .
You can specify network settings and default localization settings .
It 's also possible to create system user accounts with specific passwords and groups .
If the appliance includes MySQL , you can upload a SQL dump to populate the database with default content .
It 's even possible to customize appliance branding by setting a custom logo image and wallpaper .
After SUSE Studio generates an appliance , you can perform a live test directly in your browser .
This is possibly the most impressive feature of SUSE Studio .
When you click the test drive link for an appliance , SUSE Studio will run it in a remote virtualized environment and display it to you in your browser window through an interactive Flash VNC client .
This allows you to test the appliance before you download and deploy it .
The test drive feature has basic networking support so that you can test Web applications that are running in the appliance .
The SUSE Studio user interface is extremely well - engineered .
The whole experience is polished , intuitive , and painless .
It 's much easier than working with Ubuntu 's vmbuilder command line tool .
It 's also slightly better organized than rPath 's rBuilder , which we looked at last year .
Novell developer Cornelius Schumacher has written a blog entry with additional technical details about the service .
He says that it 's largely a Ruby on Rails application that was built on top of SUSE 's Kiwi command - line appliance tools .
He also discusses some of the ways that he is using it personally for appliance building .
" For my personal work Studio has become an important tool .
I used it for example to create the Marble Live CD , or for my hackweek project , the KDE SDK , " he wrote .
" It 's also a nice way to try out software or create an updated openSUSE version , for example with the latest KDE . "
SUSE Studio is a top - notch tool for building virtual appliances .
It showcases the flexibility of the Linux platform and makes distro customization trivially easy .

Executive summary :
Adrian
White , Analytic Social Psychologist at the University of Leicester has produced the first ever global projection of international differences in subjective well - being .
Happiness is being healthy , wealthy and wise .
Sweden No. 7 and Norway No. 19 .
Edited by Peter Horn D enmark is No. 1 , Sweden No. 7 and Norway No. 19 of 178 countries for happiness .
Happiness is found to be most closely associated with health , followed by wealth and then education .
A University of Leicester psychologist has produced the first ever world map of happiness : Adrian White , an analytic social psychologist at the University 's School of Psychology , analysed data published by UNESCO , the CIA , the New Economics Foundation , the WHO , the Veenhoven Database , the Latinbarometer , the Afrobarometer , and the UNHDR , to create a global projection of subjective well - being : the first world map of happiness .
Participants in the various studies were asked questions related to happiness and satisfaction with life .
The meta - analysis is based on the findings of over 100 different studies around the world , which questioned 80,000 people worldwide .
For this study data has also been analysed in relation to health , wealth and access to education .
Whilst collecting data on subjective well - being is not an exact science , the measures used are very reliable in predicting health and welfare outcomes .
It can be argued that whilst these measures are not perfect they are the best we have so far , and these are the measures that politicians are talking of using to measure the relative performance of each country .
How to track happiness
The researchers have argued that regular testing as a collaboration between academics in different countries would enable us to track changes in happiness , and what events may cause that .
For example what effect would a war , or famine , or national success have on a country 's members ' happiness . . -
The concept of happiness , or satisfaction with life , is currently a major area of research in economics and psychology , most closely associated with new developments in positive psychology .
It has also become a feature in the current political discourse in the UK , says Adrian White . -
There is increasing political interest in using measures of happiness as a national indicator in conjunction with measures of wealth .
A recent BBC survey found that 81 % of the population think the Government should focus on making us happier rather than wealthier .
He stresses , that it is worth remembering that the UK is doing relatively well in this area , coming 41st out of 178 nations .
- Further analysis showed that a nation 's level of happiness was most closely associated with health levels ( correlation of .62 ) , followed by wealth ( .52 ) , and then provision of education ( .51 ) .
The three predictor variables of health , wealth and education were also very closely associated with each other , illustrating the interdependence of these factors .
Wealth and happiness
Adrian
White says , there is a belief that capitalism leads to unhappy people .
However , when people are asked if they are happy with their lives , people in countries with good healthcare , a higher GDP per captia , and access to education were much more likely to report being happy .
-
We were surprised to see countries in Asia scoring so low , with China 82nd , Japan 90th and India 125th .
These are countries that are thought as having a strong sense of collective identity which other researchers have associated with well - being .
He underlines , that it is notable that many of the largest countries in terms of population do quite badly .
With China 82nd , India 125th and Russia 167th it is interesting to note that larger populations are not associated with happy countries .
-
The frustrations of modern life , and the anxieties of the age , seem to be much less significant compared to the health , financial and educational needs in other parts of the World .
The current concern with happiness levels in the UK may well be a case of the ' worried well ' .

While the short story was invented in the U.S. , it is actually rooted in oral traditions that began before written language existed .
Oral storytelling and narratives were not only entertaining , but they provided explanations in a time when many concepts were misunderstood .
These stories served their purposes in many different ways :
to explain how things came to be ( myths & legends )
were a way to record parts of history and retain important information ( epics , ballads , and sagas )
served as a method for teaching moral behavior ( parables & fables )
When humans began writing , storytelling then became even more complex and involved , as writers could delve into many different areas of society and life .
When the first Americans began to settle in the states , time for reading was a luxury .
There were not as many publishers in the U.S. as there were in Europe and in order for American writers to get published , they had to condense their work into short , more concise pieces .
Edgar Allen Poe , Washington Irving , and Nathaniel Hawthorne are known as some of the first short story authors .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , short stories usually " consist of prose works of fiction under 10,000 words , differing from a novel , in that they are shorter and less elaborate . "
Usually , short stories are even more condensed ; commonly up to 1,200 words .
The term " short story " was first mentioned in print in Harper 's Magazine in 1887 , in the form of " short story writing . "
In 1842 , Hawthorne released a book of stories called Twice Told Tales .
Poe reviewed and praised the book , saying that Hawthorne had set the foundation for a new American literary form .
Poe 's criteria for this form consisted of two elements :
Everything in the story contributed to a singular effect
They were short enough to finish reading in one sitting
In 1901 , Brander Matthews expanded Poe 's definition , saying that a short story was a story with 1 ) a single character , 2 ) engaged in a single event , 3 ) resulting in a single emotion for the reader .
An old joke has an English teacher telling a class that the five requisites to a good short story are " brevity , a religious reference , a sexual reference , some association with society , and an illustration of modesty . "
The next day a student handed in a story that read in full : " My God ! " said the duchess .
" Take your hand off my knee ! "
A coroner has found that an Aboriginal man was " cooked to death " after he spent four hours in the back of a security van in searing heat with no air conditioning as it drove across the goldfields of south - west Australia .
The 46 - year - old Aboriginal elder suffered third degree burns after collapsing in the heat and falling to the floor of the van while it travelled 250 miles from Laverton to Kalgoorlie in 47C heat .
Ward , whose first name cannot be used because of an Aboriginal cultural prohibition that forbids relatives from naming their dead , had been arrested a day earlier in January 2008 for drink driving .
He was given 600 ml ( one pint ) of water before boarding the van but the coroner found he died before he could finish drinking it .
His body temperature was so high that when he arrived unconscious at Kalgoorlie hospital , medical staff could not cool his body down , despite giving him an ice bath .
He also had a cut on his head from falling in the van and a third - degree burn to his stomach from lying on the vehicle 's hot metal floor .
The West Australian coroner , Alistair Hope , found that Ward was effectively " cooked " to death and heavily criticised the state prisons department , the private security firm that operated the van and the two guards who escorted Ward .
" It is a disgrace that a prisoner in the 21st century , particularly a prisoner who has not been convicted of any crime , was transported for a long distance in high temperatures , " Hope said .
The security guards , who did not check to see if he needed a toilet break , food or water , had breached their duty of care .
Even when they heard a thud in the back of the van they failed to check properly and instead threw water on Ward through the chained - up inner door , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 's Four Corners programme reported .
Hope also questioned the reliability of the security guards ' evidence and suggested possible collusion , prompting the company that provides the transport service , GSL , to suspend them from duty .
It has been almost 20 years since a royal commission raised the alarm of the widespread lack of care for Australian indigenous prisoners .
The 1987 commission noted the disproportionately high number of Aboriginal Australians who were incarcerated and recommended measures to address the problem .
Yet in 2005 a government survey revealed that , while Aborigines comprised 2 - 3 % of the population , they accounted for 20 % of prisoners .

Out of curiosity i wanted to learn how to put together bindings from C to Haskell .
The primary need for this on my radar is enabling X composition directly in Haskell , to enable 3D effects in XMonad .
Haskell is a great language for doing graphics work , so there is definitely good sense in providing bindings for such things .
However , working with X can be a bit of a large project as the build systems and workflows for bindings are already relatively complex .
I decided to familiarize myself with C2HS , which seems like the future of Haskell bindings , based on the brief bit of research i did .
Another important set of bindings we may need in the future are good bindings to the RPM library .
Problem here is that there is no good documentation on testing bindings with C2HS from start to finish .
What follows is roughly a guide to the results i got , minus the swearing , crashing out in a nervous caffinated wreck for a few hours in between , and the tasty " Hollandse Nieuw " herring i had when i woke up .
( This year 's herring is really tasty , if you get the chance to visit Holland , try one or two of them . )
The following is just bare metal work , in order to test the basic functionality of your bindings .
There will hopefully be posts following this one on how to use autotools and cabal in order to build packages .
( As soon as i figure it out myself . )
C2HS 's workflow can be summed up as this .
Write code in the C2HS format which is passed through C2HS as a preprocessor , which yields Haskell code .
You run this code through ghc with extra command line flags to link the right libraries , and it yields a nice Haskell Library that you can link to later .
Then just import your code in your program like normal , and you 're good to go .
As a sane demo , i am starting with the sample code from the RPM documentation .
This can be found here under Listing 16 - 1 First off , make your project directory .
For me this is / rpm / .
Since i want the library to be RedHat.
Rpm.RpmLib i also need a directory / rpm / RedHat / Rpm /.
( I 'm debating if i want to keep the RedHat prefix . )
Then create a file / rpm / RedHat / Rpm/ RpmLib.chs , and immediately begin it with : rpmReadConfigFiles is the only function we need so far from RPM .
The first two lines enable extensions to GHC .
The first is for doing Foreign functions , the second will be used later .
Then include a standard CPP include statement .
Finally we declare the module and the tokens it exports and import two modules we need from Haskell .
Some of these details can be put off into the build system later , but since we are working with the tools directly , we can just put them in our code .
The function we want to bind is defined in /usr / include / rpm / rpmlib.h as such : This presents a bit of a unique problem .
Normally a C style string presents two possibilities we need to account for .
Either it contains characters or it's an empty string .
Haskell can handle this equally as well with the String type .
However , here we have a third possibility , the two in parameters can be null pointers , which is not exactly the same as an empty string .
Internally we can handle all three cases in Haskell as a Ptr CChar which lines up exactly to the C function .
However , at the outer levels , we really need to create a function that can accept either a null pointer or a String .
In order to handle this , we need a new class of RString , such that :
One of the gotchas of programming C level code in Haskell is that all C level code , namely pointers , need to run inside the IO Monad .
There simply is n't a ( safe ) way to convert something like a String to a Ptr CChar outside of IO .
C2HS makes use of a withT function pattern to marshall pure Haskell data to pointers to objects in C.
In our case , if we get a String , whether containing data or empty , we need to marshal it into a CString .
If we get a Ptr though , we can assume it 's already been marshalled .
Chances are , there are cases that can break this , but for our simple example , there 's relatively little harm we can do .
In any case , withCString first marshals the String into a CString and then does pretty much what the Ptr version of our code does .
With all this squared away , we can define our function pretty much as per the documentation for C2HS .
This creates a new function that cannot call back into Haskell code , accepts anything of RString class , and marshals it with our code .
This returns an IO Int .
This is it for our binding .
The fun part is compiling it .
The first step is to run c2hs on the .chs file .
We need to include parameters to the C Preprocessor that tells c2hs where to find the C header files .
We also use -l to copy C2HS.hs into the same directory , as it is needed by ghc later .
The next step is to run GHC on the resulting .hs file .
Now that this is done , the next step is to build an executable that uses this binding in order to test it .
This file , rpm1.hs goes in /rpm / Since we defined our class only for Ptr CChar ( aka CString ) and not for the general Ptr a , we use a helper to type cast null Ptr .
There 's probably a more idiomatic way to do this , but all we need is a kludge .
The rest pulls the integer result from the function and prints it on the screen .
To compile this , we use the following ghc magic .
It includes another call to link in the rpm library .
That is from start to finish how to write your own C bindings in Haskell .
Hopefully i'll figure out how to get this to work via cabal , so i do n't need to run so many commands to run tests .
Scientists in Sydney have discovered a way to stimulate the brain 's own stem cells , which has the potential to lead to a new treatment for neurological disorders such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's disease .
Bryce Vissel and Andrea Abdipranoto at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research identified a chemical , called activin A , that is essential for the brain 's own stem cells to form new nerve cells , and to repair the brain , following neurodegeneration .
Using a mouse model , the researchers showed that , following acute nerve cell damage , the brain immediately acts to repair itself by replacing the damaged nerve cells with new cells .
The researchers then showed that the brain does this by releasing activin A .
But when the chemical was blocked , regeneration stopped .
After five years of laboratory testing , the researchers made the surprising finding that activin A has an essential but indirect role in regeneration : it works by inhibiting the replication and activation of inflammatory cells .
" Unit members would go and play soccer with Iraqi kids instead of going on patrol .
I knew soldiers who learned to simulate vehicular movement on the computer screen , to create the impression of being on patrol . " -- Josh Simpson
" Nearly each day they pull into a parking lot , drink soda , and shoot the cans .
They pay Iraqi kids to bring them things and spread the word that they are not doing anything and to please leave them alone . " -- Geoff Millard
" Our platoon sergeant , an E7 , was with us and he knew our patrols were bullshit , just riding around to get blown up .
We were at Camp Victory , at Baghdad International Airport .
A lot of time we'd leave the main gate and come right back in another gate to the base where there 's a big PX .
They had a nice mess hall , and a Burger King .
The BK is where we wanted to go and to the PX and look at DVDs and dirty magazines .
We 'd leave one guy at the Humvees to call in every hour , and we 'd spend the full eight hours doing this . " -- Cliff Hicks
" A big thing used to be squads putting up in some Iraqi 's house for a day or two , just going there and staying .
They insert themselves in a house covertly in order to watch a neighborhood without anyone knowing that they were there .
But it is really not about watching .
It is about sleeping .
Hopefully the squad is well - accepted in the family .
Sometimes they even make friends .
A few soldiers keep watch , the rest of the squad catch up on sleep and relax for a change . " -- Bryan Casler
" So we would go and drop the dismounted people at some house with an air conditioner , where they would kick in a door and hang out and drink tea with those people , while we would proceed with the vehicles and bide time out of visible range . " -- Seth Manzel
What a bunch of slackers : that might be an appropriate response to all of this if there were some comprehensible and worthwhile thing that any of these people were supposed to be doing .
But , as Jamail 's book makes clear , when US soldiers in Iraq are not avoiding their duty they are engaging in harassment , abuse , torture , the murder of civilians , endless stress and trauma , and the risk of their own death and injury for no purpose that has been made clear to them .
Soldiers quoted in the book point out that if their own nation were occupied they would certainly fight back just as the Iraqis do .
In fact , these are soldiers who signed up to fight for a cause .
Some of them fell for the post - 9 - 11 propaganda and signed up thinking they would help defend the United States .
Many of them signed up for economic reasons , but they also had a willingness to kill and risk death for a noble cause .
Many of them tried to do so for years before losing faith .
And what went away , other than their physical and mental well being , was not their courage or generosity .
It was their ability to convince themselves they were risking their lives for any good reason .
As recounted in " The Will to Resist , " which ought to be read by every American , avoidance of duty ( or , rather , illegal orders masquerading as duty ) in Iraq has often evolved seamlessly into refusal to obey .
Jamail recounts incidents of individuals and squads refusing to obey orders .
If you were sent out at the same time every night to the same place , and were losing more friends each time to predictable attacks , for no apparent reason , would you not at some point refuse to go out yet another time , at least without changing your path and timing ?
Most of these soldiers do not have any understanding that war is always a mistake .
They are willing to fight a war if someone can explain to them what the purpose of it is , or what a victory would look like .
But they have turned against this particular war , since nobody can explain it to them , and they have seen for themselves that what they do in it accomplishes no good .
So , some soldiers refuse to load their guns , risking their own lives rather than kill .
Others go AWOL .
Others , indeed , turn against all wars and apply for conscientious objector status .
Some leave the country , some go to jail , some go to court and win .
All of these stories are found in this book .
So is a rich collection of stories from Winter Soldier , the series of events organized by Iraq Veterans Against the War , at which veterans of the Iraq War have described what they did -- most of it far more shameful and painful than facing the charge of " slacker " from fat chicken hawks in air conditioned studios .
Iraq Veterans Against the War turns five years old this week and continues to grow rapidly , as it should : http://ivaw.org
Other worthwhile organizations to join and support are described in " The Will to Resist , " which includes a powerful foreword by Chris Hedges , and some excellent chapters on how veterans are trying to deal with PTSD , injuries , lack of income , and despair , the products of a war that kills more US troops through post - combat suicide than through enemy attacks .
The resistance movement within the military to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is still not what it was during the Vietnam War .
Soldiers today were not drafted away from lucrative careers .
They are in the military because they do not have other options , and almost half of them have families to support .
And soldiers are kept together in their units so that they will each fight out of loyalty to their buddies even if they all oppose the fighting .
But , as Jamail discusses , soldiers who want to resist lack the same support from civilians that was provided during the Vietnam War .
That 's the rest of us .
We have a duty to read these books , support the groups doing the work , build up the coffee shops near the bases , keep the military out of our schools , and offer our time to assist those willing to make a more courageous choice than that of simply obeying illegal orders .
Inquiring minds are flabbergasted over the latest comments from Vice President Joe Biden : ‘ We Have to Go Spend Money to Keep From Going Bankrupt ’
“ Now , people when I say that look at me and say , ‘ What are you talking about , Joe ?
You ’re telling me we have to go spend money to keep from going bankrupt ? ’ ” Biden said .
“ The answer is yes , that 's what I ’m telling you . ”
An American major after the destruction of the Vietnamese Village Ben Tre : " It became necessary to destroy the village in order to save it . "
" We met no resistance and I only saw three captured weapons .
We had no casualties .
It was just like any other Vietnamese village - old papa - sans , women and kids , " a soldier said describing what they found on entering My Lai .
" As a matter of fact , I do n't remember seeing one military - age male in the entire place , dead or alive . "
" There was an old lady in a bed and I believe there was a priest in white praying over her ... [ U.S. Lt. ]
Calley pulled the old man outside .
He said a few more words to the monk .
It looked like the monk was pleading for his life .
Lt. Calley then took his rifle and pushed the monk into a rice paddy and shot him point - blank . "

For many observers , the biggest takeaway of the New York Times ' bombshell report on President Trump 's finances is how often in recent years Trump has paid little to no income tax , but for former intelligence officials , it 's the potential of his massive debt to make him susceptible to foreign influence .
The Times exposé , which is based on years of Trump 's tax returns obtained by the paper , said the president “ is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $ 421 million , with most of it coming due within four years . ”
The Times report said that the scale of the president 's debts , with few obvious income streams to service them , paints a picture “ of a businessman - president in a tightening financial vise . ”
In the UK , luxury tuning is not a rarity .
Today it ’s time to make acquaintance with a new company with such a specific , what is called Revere London .
For starters , Revere London took the SUV as the Range Rover Sport .
Thus , on the outside and did place a new body kit – consisting of the front grille and new front and rear Spoil – but also new wheels measuring 22 inches .
Inside , future passengers will be treated with leather , Alcantara , various inserts ( wood or carbon ) and multimedia system .
From a technical viewpoint , we have lower suspension , Brembo braking system , a new exhaust and ECU as the motor for the British SUV .

Club Nintendo Announces Elite Reward Prizes
by Brian Bentley [ Wednesday , 15th of July 2009 - 02:48 PM ]
The first year of Club Nintendo ended on June 30th of this year .
By that time , you needed to have accrued 300 or 600 coins for Gold and Platinum status , respectively .
The elite status of every member resets for each " year . "
You still retain your points but Nintendo wants to make sure you keep buying their products .
I was fortunate enough to have accrued 600 coins for the inaugural year and achieved Platinum status .
My choices are an exclusive DLC of Punch Out !
where you play as Little Mac sparring against your trainer , mentor and friend , Doc Louis or an authentic Mario Hat that I can physically wear .
I have not decided as to which reward I will take but I have until August 11th to decide .
Write comments below if you have an opinion .
The Gold status level reward is not what I would classify as the greatest reward but considering the difference between Gold and Platinum is a minimum purchase of 5 Wii titles .
The reward is a Club Nintendo 2010 calendar .
Either way you look at it , you are still receiving swag for purchasing Nintendo products .
Here 's hoping the fall and spring releases ( Super Mario Galaxy 2 anyone ? ) come out in force so that I can reach Platinum status again .
Mind that age !
This blog post is 11 years old !
Most likely , its content is outdated .
Especially if it 's technical .
By popular demand I 've made my little pyinotify wrapper available for download .
It 's nothing fancy really but damn useful and productive .
It relies on inotify ( so you 're stuffed on OSX and Windows ) which makes it very fast and efficient ( as opposed to periodic polling and file modification time comparisons ) .
At the moment it 's actually quite generic for any command and any file but I 'm hoping to take this to the next level with some magic dust that automatically only runs unit tests that fail or something .
We 'll see what happens .
Here 's an example configuration that I 'm currently using :
DIRECTORIES = ( ( ' search/unit_tests/test_views.py ' , './manage.py test -- settings=test_settings search.ViewTestCase ' ) , ( ' search/unit_tests ' , './manage.py test -- settings=test_settings search ' ) , ( ' search ' , './manage.py test -- settings=test_settings search ' ) , )

KALAMAZOO --
By his own admission , William Kimbrel Bradley is n't a very good criminal , racking up six felonies and four misdemeanors by age 25 .
He added to the list Monday when he was sentenced for larceny in a building .
Bradley stole a computer .
From the Kalamazoo County Jail .
Where he was serving a sentence on a different case .
" This is the dumbest crime I 've heard today , " Kalamazoo County Circuit Judge Gary C. Giguere Jr. told the Kalamazoo resident .
" It may be in the top half - dozen in my career .
" You need to get a handle on this theft thing .
Your life of crime is not working out . "
Bradley , a student at Western Michigan University , agreed .
" I 'm not the best criminal , " he said .
Bradley said he 's been going to counseling for several months for stealing stuff -- something he 's done since he was a kid , even if he did n't need or want the item he was taking .
" Where do I put you ? " Giguere said .
" Back in the jail where the crime occurred ? "
Bradley asked for home arrest .
Giguere said no and ordered him back to jail for 180 days , plus state fees .
On Jan. 31 , Bradley took a computer that had been delivered to the jail -- and was still in the box -- put it in a trash bag and placed the bag behind large garbage bins for later pickup , said jail administrator Lt. Gail Sampsell .
The box was sitting in a garage area that is monitored by security cameras , Sampsell said .
When the computer was discovered missing , video of the garage showed Bradley had taken it from there .
Bradley holds active status as a sophomore at WMU , spokeswoman Cheryl Roland said .
He is listed as studying psychology and chemistry .

The swine flu virus has claimed its first victim in the UK , after a female patient died in a Scottish hospital .
The victim is understood to be a woman aged 38 who gave birth prematurely while being treated at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley .
The death is the first outside the Americas , where more than 140 people have died since the pandemic began .
Swine flu has now infected almost 500 people in Scotland alone , out of 1,261 cases in the UK .
The patient was one of 10 people being treated for swine flu in the greater Glasgow area .
A statement issued by the Scottish Government said : " With regret , we can confirm that one of the patients who had been in hospital , and had been confirmed as suffering from the H1N1 virus , has died today .
" The patient had underlying health conditions . "
It 's worth remembering that seasonal flu kills several thousand people in the UK each winter
Fergus Walsh , BBC medical correspondent
Fergus On Flu : latest blog entry Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said : " I 'd like to express my condolences to the patient 's family and friends .
This is a tragedy for those concerned and they have my heartfelt sympathy .
" Tragic though today 's death is , I would like to emphasise that the vast majority of those who have H1N1 are suffering from relatively mild symptoms . "
The BBC 's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh said : " Swine flu does present a slightly higher risk to those with existing respiratory illness , asthma , cardiovascular disease and obesity . "
He added : " It 's worth remembering that seasonal flu kills several thousand people in the UK each winter .
The difference with H1N1 swine flu is that the virus is almost exclusively targeting people under 65 . "
Thirty - five new cases of swine flu in Scotland were confirmed on Sunday .
Together with 61 new cases in England and one case in Northern Ireland confirmed on Sunday , a total of 1,261 people have now caught the virus in the UK .
Another 486 possible UK cases are being investigated .
Chances remote Virologist Professor John Oxford said that despite the death , the public should not panic .
" I still think the chances of picking up the virus are remote .
It is not going to get any worse during the summer . "
Professor Oxford said he did not think the the public had become complacent and said the country was well prepared in terms of anti-viral drugs .
The UK government outlined measures it has taken to combat the outbreak earlier this week .
Ministers urged people not to alter their normal behaviour and follow hand hygiene guidelines .

The story we tell ourselves about what happened to the financial markets last fall is vitally important .
It will determine what form financial market regulation takes in the next few decades , and how vulnerable we will be to the next disruption .
At this moment , a relatively calm one , a fictional version of last fall 's events is gaining traction .
So let 's review a few foundational facts .
September 2008 was a busy month .
On Sunday , the 7th , the U.S. government nationalized the two large government - sponsored mortgage enterprises , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which had been privatized in 1968 .
The following Sunday , the investment - banking house of Merrill Lynch was forcibly merged into Bank of America .
The next day , Lehman Brothers simply did not open .
The old - line investment bank went into an uncontrolled and unsupervised bankruptcy , and all financial - market expectations that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury would guarantee the unsecured debt of every substantial investment bank in America , as they had for Bear Stearns , went out the window .
Wednesday , Sept. 17 , saw the nationalization of American International Group , which , unlike Lehman , was deemed too big to fail .
Government - injected cash went straight through AIG and out the other end — like grain through a goose .
The forced feeding may total $ 300 billion before we are through .
The bankruptcies of Fannie , Freddie , Lehman , and AIG ; the fall in the prices of risky assets worldwide ; the shutdown of the flow of funds through financial markets as trust evaporated and everyone presumed that whomever they entrusted their money to might go bankrupt — this was September 's harvest .
Risk tolerance collapsed .
People became much less willing to hold risky assets at any price .
The interest rate on 30 - year Treasury bonds fell to less than 3 percent .
And it was presumed that every large bank in America would be bankrupt if they were forced to mark to market .
The banks ' survival depended on their ( a ) not having to sell assets until asset prices rebounded , and ( b ) the availability of enough government money , at cheap enough prices , to enable them to avoid selling any assets at fire - sale prices .
This troubling tale led to the largest recession in postwar history .
Yet if you go to the big banks of Wall Street right now , most of them will say : " What is the problem ? "
They will deny that any changes in the way they run their businesses are called for .
" Sure there were a few scary moments , " they say , " but big shocks cause scary moments .
And our fundamental business model is sound . "
Indeed , as Paul Kedrosky points out , if you look at the stock prices of Goldman , JPMorgan Chase , Barclays , and Morgan Stanley , they are back where they were in late August 2008 before the worst unpleasantness began .
( Citi , however , is still down 75 percent and Bank of America is off 67 percent . )
So , they say , there is no need for government investments in , or control over , their businesses ; no need for restrictions on how much they can pay whom or for what ; no need to restrict how much leverage they assume or what they invest in or how much capital they must hold .
The smart banks , they say , figured out that the mortgage market was headed for a crash and managed to profit from the boom without being destroyed by the bust .
It was only the dumb banks , they say — Bear Stearns , Lehman , AIG , Fannie , Freddie , and to a lesser degree , Citi and Bank of America — that suffered severely .
That 's how the market works .
This is a fairy tale .
Suppose for a moment , that things had been handled differently last September .
Suppose that the Federal Reserve had announced not that it was buying up the stock of AIG and that it would make sure that all of AIG 's debts were paid , but rather that AIG was bankrupt .
Suppose the Federal Reserve said it would rescue AIG 's bank clients by paying out cash at par for contracts with AIG — provided that it also got ( a ) upside warrants in the bank and ( b ) an illiquid , long - dated note , the value of which would be determined by formula after the crisis passed .
In that case , Goldman , JPMorgan , Barclays , Morgan Stanley , Citi , and Bank of America would still have been able to function — they would have had enough cash to pay their bills and enough assets to match their liabilities — but they would now be owned by the federal government .
Because all the money passed through AIG to the banks would not be a loss for the government but would rather have been in the form of government investments in still - solvent banks .
The resulting expansion of the banks ' share issue would have left their stock prices today a shadow of their values last August .
When American high finance hedged its mortgage risk by buying derivatives from AIG , it did not perform due diligence to figure out if AIG could in fact meet its obligations .
This failure cost American high finance an amount that may ultimately reach $ 300 billion .
And it would have been fatal had the government not come to their rescue .
Had the government stepped in by discounting AIG paper in return for warrants and notes at fair market values , the banks ' life - support apparatus would have been obvious .
It is only because the government stepped in by nationalizing AIG and guaranteeing its debts that American high finance now has healthy stock prices , and that the senior executives of the big banks — except Citi , Bank of America , Lehman , and Bear Stearns — are congratulating themselves for their skillful navigation through the crisis .
The fact that the rescue of the banking system took the form of nationalization of AIG , and the honoring of its paper , rather than equity investments by the government in the banks , and the discounting of AIG paper , has encouraged a bout of revisionism in which most of Wall Street and at least a third of Congress now embrace a fairy tale .
They tell themselves — and us — a story of a banking system that was fundamentally sound , that merely needed a little temporary liquidity to tide itself over a panic .
But the true story is one of an overleveraged banking system that was insolvent save for a $ 300 billion gift from American taxpayers .
In September , Wall Street was overrun with bears .
Now it seems Goldilocks has taken up residence there , too .
“ I am going to be fine in all this , ” said Mr. Dodd , who spoke from his office in Hartford with his wife , Jackie Clegg Dodd , alongside him .
“ This is very common .
If you ’ve got to have cancer , I am told by some doctors , it ’s the slowest growing , the best one to have , the most manageable . ”

His announcement came as a surprise to people in politics and elicited sympathy from many , including his likely Republican rival in the 2010 Senate race , former Representative Rob Simmons .
It also set off questions about how the cancer would affect his political future .
At his news conference , Mr. Dodd moved to dispel any notion that he might not seek another term .
“ I ’m running for re-election , ” he said without prompting .
“ Now , I ’ll be a little leaner and a little meaner .
But I am running . ”
Then he added with a laugh : “ I ’ll be running without a prostate .
That will make a better candidate , I think . ”
Mr. Dodd is the chairman of the Senate banking committee , but he is currently at the center of the government ’s battle over health care , acting as chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee for his close friend Senator Edward M. Kennedy , the Massachusetts Democrat , who is fighting brain cancer .
ANN ARBOR , Mich. , June 26 ( UPI ) -- University of Michigan students say they have designed a palm - sized metal detector designed to locate hidden improvised - explosive devices .
The detectors could be hidden , say , in trash cans , under tables or in flower pots , the students say , and they 're connected to a wireless network that sends to a movable " base station " information on where IEDs are located .

The sensors are cheaper , use less power and have a longer range than existing technology , Nilton Renno , a professor in the UM Department of Atmospheric , Oceanic and Space Science , said in a press release .
The students created the sensors as a project for Renno 's class .
" Their invention outperforms everything that exists in the market today , " Renno said .
" They clearly have an excellent understanding of the problem .
They also thought strategically and designed and optimized their solution , " he said .
Ashwin Lalendran , an engineering student who worked on the project , said the students designed all the software and hardware as part of a class .
Suicide bombers in Afghanistan and Iraq often use IEDs .
It 's been a record - setting summer for IPOs .
Vroom Inc. , Lemonade Inc. , and BigCommerce Holdings Inc. all soared on their initial public offering debuts .
Then came the record - setter , Snowflake Inc. - the largest U.S. software IPO and the biggest company ever to double in value on its opening day .
So this profit - rich , success - soaked moment is opportune for Airbnb , the vacation - rental " unicorn " that 's a heavy favorite to go public by the end of 2020 .
Good thing , too ( for Airbnb ) .
The company 's had a rough year , to put it mildly .
The company slashed headcount by a quarter back in May , and , as The Wall Street Journal reported , saw its valuation plummet from $ 31 billion to $ 18 billion - a rare occurrence for such a celebrated private firm .
So investors are feeling bullish about this company once again , including yours truly - I do think this is going to be a good long - term investment .
Still , this may not be a slam - dunk IPO á la Zoom .
It would be a pricey mistake to rush out and grab the first shares that hit the market .
Grab them at the wrong time - the wrong price - and you could be looking at a long , long trip back to the " plus " side of the ledger .
This is going to take some strategizing , like so ...
Justice Yemen - style : Paedophile who raped boy , 11 , shot in the head in front of hundreds of spectators
This is criminal justice , Yemen style .
A man accused of raping and murdering an 11 - year - old boy is paraded through his home town before being shot dead by an executioner .
Hundreds of onlookers lined the streets to watch the gruesome scene , cheering and shouting abuse at Yehya Hussein al - Raghwah .
The boy , Hamdi al - Kabas , had reportedly come into his shop for a haircut last December during the Muslim festival of Eid .
After brutally attacking him , the barber cut his body into pieces and dumped them outside the capital Sana'a .
Yemenis gather to watch a Yemeni soldier execute a man , lying face down on a large piece of red cloth , his hands bound behind him
He was given the death penalty by a Yemeni court a month later after apparently admitting his crime .
Shocking images of his final moments were released following the execution yesterday .
First he leaves the city 's central prison , handcuffed and dressed in white robes .
Fear etched on his face , he is surrounded by soldiers as he is led towards a ceremonial red carpet .
He is allowed to say a final prayer , his shirt is then ripped open before he is laid face down .
As a police official reads out his sentence for the last time , a doctor oversees his treatment and crowds - which appear to include children - jeer and punch the air , some filming his final moment on their mobile phones .

A soldier brandishes his machine gun at the nape of the barber 's neck , and within a split second it is all over .
His death brings the number of executions in the country this year to nine .
Yemen is one of 59 countries which retains the death penalty , and one of its most prolific users , according to Amnesty International .
It is deployed for a variety of violent and non-violent crimes including apostasy and adultery .
Last year Yemen executed 13 people , according to those Amnesty has verified .
But as no official figures are released the real toll could be far higher .
All of those died by firing squad but in recent years there have been reports of stonings and beheadings .
The deeply religious desert country has a poor human rights record and it is unclear if the barber had a fair trial .
Under sharia law , which applies in Yemen , relatives of the victims of certain categories of murder have the power to pardon the offender in exchange for compensation , grant a pardon freely or request his or her execution .

Fox News received Doug Hampton ’s letter about Sen. John Ensign ’s adulterous affair three days earlier than the network reported , according to information obtained exclusively by the Las Vegas Sun .
Fox said it did n’t receive the letter until June 15 , when it arrived as an attachment to an e-mail .
But FedEx tracking of a “ priority envelope , ” which a reliable source said contained the hard copy , shows it was delivered on the morning of June 12 .
That would mean the national news organization had additional time to investigate and report Ensign ’s affair before the senator ’s own admission of the relationship with Hampton ’s wife , who worked for the senator ’s leadership political action committees .
The earlier delivery date also leaves a larger window of time for someone who either worked at the conservative network or was close to it to tip off Ensign .
On Tuesday , Tom Lowell , senior producer of “ America ’s Newsroom , ” declined to comment on the FedEx delivery .
Hampton had addressed his June 11 letter to the co-anchor of “ America ’s Newsroom , ” Megyn Kelly .
“ For our part , everything I can answer has sort of been asked and answered at this point , ” Lowell said .
“ I ’ve put out everything I knew . ”
FedEx representatives confirmed that the document , sent from Las Vegas on June 11 , was delivered to the Fox corporate headquarters address in New York City .
Las Vegas attorney Daniel Albregts , who represents Doug and Cynthia , declined to comment .
In response to the Sun ’s story about the letter Friday , Lowell told the online Huffington Post that his network receives a lot of correspondence that takes time to sort through .
Hampton had noted in his letter that he would follow up with an e-mail as well as phone messages .
Lowell said a Fox staffer contacted Hampton , a former top aide in Ensign ’s Capitol Hill office , on June 15 after receiving the e-mail but found Hampton evasive and not credible , so the network decided against pursuing a story .
The next day Ensign held a news conference in Las Vegas to confess to the eight - month affair , which ended in August .
Ensign ’s office acknowledged that the news conference was called after Ensign received word that Doug Hampton had gone to Fox News .
But the senator ’s staff has not said who tipped Ensign off , and Lowell has insisted no one on his “ editorial team ” alerted Ensign .
This week Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz , responding to questions on Poynter Online , said a source told him that former Pennsylvania Sen .
Rick Santorum , a Fox News contributor , “ happened to separately receive the Hampton letter .
But I do n’t know if he told his former colleague Ensign about it or not . ”
In the letter , however , Hampton told Fox , “ This is the only letter of its kind and no other news stations have been contacted with this information . ”
Santorum , who served in the Senate from 1995 to 2007 , was unavailable for comment Tuesday .
He is now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center , a conservative Washington think tank .
Like Ensign , Santorum is a conservative Republican with strong religious ties .
The two men are said to be close .
Kurtz shared a Washington
Post byline on a story last week that quoted Lowell as saying he did not show or send the letter to senior
Fox executives and that he erred by declining to go after the story .

( Adds quotes , background )
BEIJING , June 12 ( Reuters ) - Credit default swaps are “ instruments of destruction ” that should be outlawed , billionaire investor George Soros said on Friday .
Soros said the asymmetry of risk and reward embedded in CDS exerted so much downward pressure on the bonds underlying the contracts that companies and financial institutions could be brought to their knees .
“ Some derivatives ought not to be allowed to be traded at all .
I have in mind credit default swaps .
The more I ’ve heard about them , the more I ’ve realised they ’re truly toxic , ” he told a banking conference .
“ CDS are instruments of destruction which ought to be outlawed , ” Soros told a meeting of the Institute of International Finance , many of whose member banks and financial institutions are active participants in the huge CDS market .
Going short on bonds by purchasing a CDS contract carried limited risk but almost unlimited profit potential .
By contrast , selling CDSs offered limited profit and practically unlimited risk , Soros said .
This asymmetry , which encouraged investors in effect to sell corporate bonds short , was reinforced by the fact that CDS were traded and so tended to be priced as warrants , which could be sold at any time , and not as options , he added .
Credit default swaps are used to protect against nonpayment of debt or to speculate on a company ’s credit quality .
But Soros said : “ People buy a CDS not because they expect an eventual default but because they expect them to appreciate in response to adverse developments . ”
SKEWED INCENTIVES
He said one financial institution that discovered to its cost the risk / reward distortions of CDS was insurer American International Group AIG.N , which was a big seller of CDS , offering banks protection against a deterioration in their bond portfolios , especially mortgage - linked securities .
The U.S. government stepped in to save AIG from collapse under bad mortgage bets last September , and has put up to $ 180 billion at the company ’s disposal since .
“ AIG thought it was selling insurance on bonds and as such CDS were outrageously overpriced .
In fact AIG was selling bear market warrants and it severely underestimated their value , ” Soros said .
At this point , the phenomenon that Soros describes as reflexivity kicked in .
That is to say , the mispricing of financial instruments -- in this case , CDS -- affected the fundamentals that the prices were supposed to reflect .
Nowhere were the consequences of the ensuing chain reaction more severe than in the case of financial institutions , whose ability to do business depended on trust , Soros argued .
He cited the failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers .
But the potential damage that CDS could do was not limited to financial firms , Soros added .
He pointed to the bankruptcy of North America 's largest newsprint maker , AbitibiBowater Inc ABWTQ.PK , and the pending bankruptcy of General Motors GM.N
“ In both cases , some bondholders owned CDS and they stood to gain more by bankruptcy than by reorganisation .
“ It ’s like buying life insurance on someone else ’s life and owning a license to kill , ” he concluded .
Soros ’ criticism echoes fellow investor Warren Buffet ’s description of derivatives in 2003 as “ financial weapons of mass destruction ” .
On derivatives in general , Soros said they should be as strictly regulated as stocks .
He said derivatives should be standardised and saw no case for custom - made derivatives , which he said only increased the profit margins of the financiers who tailored them .
But I did n't know that at the time .
I financed a $ 3,500 course on credit cards , and dutifully trooped off to class four evenings a week .
I passed all the tests .
Then I found out what any professional could have told me : without actual work experience , no one would hire me .
My classmates were all in the same boat .
Lik me , they had found themselves in career dead - ends .
Unlike me , they were n't 22 - year - olds who could live at home .
They were people who had been made redundant by technology or competition : payroll machine operators , verizon line workers , office managers , various salesmen , secretaries who could type 100 wpm in an era when bosses were increasingly doing their own typing .
I got super lucky .
The place where I 'd trained was doing a corporate training startup , and they needed someone who could a ) type b ) work for low pay and c ) futz with the network .
The startup lasted for three months , then , like my jobs before , shut down .
But now I had job experience .
It was the tech bubble .
I was laid off for less than twelve hours : I found out at ten , called an employment agency at 10:45 , went on my first interview at 1:00 , had two job offers by that evening , accepted one on Friday , and started my new job on Tuesday at a 30 % bump in salary .
The rest of my class , nine months later , was mostly still looking .
One other guy had found a job in technology .
The others had wasted $ 3,500 and five months .
This is basically typical of job retraining .
Students are overoptimistic .
Schools encourage them in their folly while collecting checks .
And employers demand real - world experience that training can't give .
It works best on people near entry - level , and those with complementary skills .
But that rarely describes the people most in need of retraining , like displaced autoworkers who have spent decades at semi-skilled labor no longer in demand .
Government programs do no better , possibly because they can't run trucking schools and electrician training programs themselves , so they end up contracting out to private parties like the school I attended ( which did a lot of BOCES training for the state of New York ) or hybrid institutions like community colleges .
Educational output is hard to measure : much depends on the student themselves .
So we tend to measure inputs instead .
Or we measure outputs --" are they employed six months after graduation ? " -- without controlling for quality of the jobs .
So I 'm not surprised to find out that when you actually do try to measure the impact on student lives , government training programs have a dismal record .
This comports with our experience in the 1980s , when we tried to retrain people out of the rust belt , and the 1990s , when we tried to do the same for people displaced by trade .
Yet whenever we experience a dislocating crisis like the auto collapse , all the pundits are out again calling for job retraining .
They 're not stupid or disingenuous ; they just do n't have any better answer for a very tough question .
But given my own experience , it strikes me that we might do better by targeting employment -- offering employers a subsidy for hiring displaced workers into a job that pays $ 10 or more an hour .
For skilled work , you might need to pair this with training .
But that would give the workers what they actually need - - a job on the resume and a new skill - - rather than a useless diploma .
Pakistan has been publicly critical of US drone attacks
Up to 50 suspected militants have been killed in two US attacks in north - west Pakistan , local officials told the BBC .
In the first attack , suspected US drones attacked a Taliban forest camp in South Waziristan , near the Afghan border , killing at least 10 militants .
Hours later , officials said about 40 militants died when five missiles hit a vehicle convoy in the same region .
It has been one of the Taliban 's deadliest days since the drone campaign began last August .
See a map of the region Separately , a top Taliban commander , Maulana Fazlullah , was reported to have been wounded during the Pakistani military 's ongoing offensive in the Swat Valley .
US DRONE ATTACKS Since August 2008 , nearly 50 strikes have killed at least 450
In the deadliest day yet , 24 June 2009 , more than 60 people died Drone strikes target tribal regions , mostly Waziristan Hellfire missiles fired from Predator craft is main method Wednesday 's suspected drone strikes were targeting militants in a stronghold of Pakistan 's top Taliban commander , Baitullah Mehsud .
The Pakistani army is now bracing itself for a major offensive against him .
In the first of Wednesday 's attacks , missiles hit the thickly - forested and mountainous Karwan Manza area , some 10 km ( six miles ) south - east of Ladha .
Officials say six missiles were fired , completely destroying a Taliban hideout , a day after another camp was hit in a similar attack nearby .
In the second attack , five missiles were fired at vehicles carrying militants on the main road between Ladha and another town , Sararogha , according to local officials .
They said all the vehicles were destroyed and the dead were mostly Taliban militants , as well as members of banned militant organisations from Pakistan 's Punjab province .
The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Islamabad says the militants targeted in the double strike were loyal to Baitullah Mehsud .
US officials believe he is providing both the Taliban and al - Qaeda with a refuge in the region .
They are offering a reward of $ 5 m ( £ 3 m ) for his capture .
' Insecurity '
Our correspondent says the increased number of drone attacks has caused a great deal of insecurity among the Pakistan Taliban commander 's fighters .
Meanwhile , there was confusion over the fate of Maulana Fazlullah - a radical cleric and a commander of the Pakistani Taliban in the Swat Valley - who is said to have been wounded in an air strike on Monday .
Profile : Baitullah Mehsud Long war against Taliban Army spokesman , Maj Gen Athar Abbas , told reporters : " We have credible information Maulana Fazlullah has been injured ...
But it is not possible to confirm whether he is alive or not . "
Analysts describe him as the " architect " of the two - year uprising aimed at enforcing Sharia law in the Swat Valley , where government troops have been engaged in a bitter campaign to oust Islamist fighters for the last two months .
The Pakistan Taliban has claimed responsibility for numerous suicide bombings and other attacks which have killed scores inside the country .
There have been dozens of suspected US pilotless air strikes since last August , mostly in the tribal North and South Waziristan regions , killing hundreds of militants and civilians .
Last month , a suspected drone struck twice within hours killing more than 60 people - most of them militants who had gathered for the funeral of those killed in the first strike .
Pakistan has been publicly critical of drone attacks , arguing that they fuel support for the militants .
The US military does not routinely confirm such strikes but the armed forces and the CIA in Afghanistan are believed to be the only elements capable of deploying drones in the region .
In March , US President Barack Obama said his government would consult Pakistan on drone attacks .

But the dignity code itself has been completely obliterated .
The rules that guided Washington and generations of people after him are simply gone .
We can all list the causes of its demise .
First , there is capitalism .
We are all encouraged to become managers of our own brand , to do self - promoting end zone dances to broadcast our own talents .
Second , there is the cult of naturalism .
We are all encouraged to discard artifice and repression and to instead liberate our own feelings .
Third , there is charismatic evangelism with its penchant for public confession .
Fourth , there is radical egalitarianism and its hostility to aristocratic manners .
The old dignity code has not survived modern life .
The costs of its demise are there for all to see .
Every week there are new scandals featuring people who simply do not know how to act .
For example , during the first few weeks of summer , three stories have dominated public conversation , and each one exemplifies another branch of indignity .
First , there was Mark Sanford ’s press conference .
Here was a guy utterly lacking in any sense of reticence , who was given to rambling self - exposure even in his moment of disgrace .
Then there was the death of Michael Jackson and the discussion of his life .
Here was a guy who was apparently untouched by any pressure to live according to the rules and restraints of adulthood .
Then there was Sarah Palin ’s press conference .
Here was a woman who aspires to a high public role but is unfamiliar with the traits of equipoise and constancy , which are the sources of authority and trust .
In each of these events , one sees people who simply have no social norms to guide them as they try to navigate the currents of their own passions .
Americans still admire dignity .
But the word has become unmoored from any larger set of rules or ethical system .
But it ’s not right to end on a note of cultural pessimism because there is the fact of President Obama .
Whatever policy differences people may have with him , we can all agree that he exemplifies reticence , dispassion and the other traits associated with dignity .
The cultural effects of his presidency are not yet clear , but they may surpass his policy impact .
He may revitalize the concept of dignity for a new generation and embody a new set of rules for self - mastery .

Please review our list of best credit cards , or use our CardMatch ™ tool to find cards matched to your needs .
Dear To Her Credit ,
I have $ 52,000 in credit card debt .
I was enrolled in a debt - solving company plan for a year , during which time I paid $ 657.50 per month and settled two accounts .
With the economic downturn , however , we ’ve been unable to make our full payments .
My husband had his hours cut back at his job , and I lost a lot of clients due to the economy ( I ’m self - employed ) .
I called my debt - solving company to ask if I could reduce the monthly payment for a short time and they said “ No . ”
So here I am — I have already paid them $ 4,500 and I am back to square one .
Now I am considering bankruptcy on this unsecured debt because I have exhausted every possibility .
It ’s wrong that a consumer should have to pay a company to work with the credit card companies on settling your debt at a reasonable rate because they will not communicate with you .
They only will harass you until you ’re dead and after .
So I feel my only option is to file bankruptcy and start fresh .
The credit card industry had better look out because President Obama is coming after you .
They are nothing less than organized crime .
— Pamela Jean
Dear Pamela Jean ,
You are in a tough spot right now .
It ’s bad enough when a recession hits one of your jobs , but both of yours have been affected .
I ’m going to be honest with you , however .
You and your husband put yourselves in a position where any dip like this in the economic road could throw you off kilter .
It ’s easy when times are good — especially if they ’ve been good for a long time — to spend money like the good times will last forever .
We look at what we make now , or what we ’ve been making for the last year or so , and decide how much we can spend .
The budget expands to fit what ’s coming in .
If we have available credit , the budget can easily expand to use that up , too .
There always have been and always will be economic bumps in the road , unfortunately .
Not planning for them can be disastrous .
Your $ 657 monthly payment on credit card debt did n’t seem bad when you and your husband were both working full time .
Now , it ’s a hard burden to bear .
Before you get mad at the banks , think about who got you into this predicament .
It was n’t the credit card companies .
All they did was lend you money that you promised to repay ( although communicating with banks can be frustrating — no doubt there ) .
The debt reduction company did what it said it would do ; it negotiated lower balances and consolidated your debts .
In return , you agreed to pay a fee and make monthly payments .
Perhaps there is more to the story , but it seems you are taking your frustrations out on companies that only want to you fulfill your ends of the bargains you made .
To see it from their point of view , imagine you loan $ 20 to your brother - in - law today .
Next week , he says he wants to negotiate what he owes you .
He offers you $ 10 , or even $ 5 .
What would you say ?
I ’d think he ’d better have a pretty good reason !
That ’s the scenario credit card companies are facing every day with thousands of customers .
They are under no legal obligation to automatically reduce people ’s balances without good cause .
I do n’t believe $ 52,000 is worth going bankrupt over .
That ’s only $ 26,000 apiece for you and your husband — not impossible amounts for two people in their working years .
Bankruptcy costs money — a lot more than the ads promise .
If bankruptcy costs you $ 5,000 by the time you pay a lawyer and trustee fees , that ’s money that could have gone to reducing your debt instead .
And if you thought debt negotiation was a letdown , wait until you try bankruptcy !
Most people who file for bankruptcy later regret it .
Debt negotiation did n’t fix the problem .
Bankruptcy wo n’t fix it easily or without consequences .
Even President Obama can not make your debt go away .
Only you have the power to take control of your finances from this day forward .
But you need help to do that .
An outside person who has helped people through troubles just like yours ( or worse ) can help you see all your options and then help you formulate a plan .
Be sure to find a reputable , nonprofit credit counselor .
It ’s never hopeless .
Please see a financial counselor as soon as possible .
Make an appointment this week .

TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - Taiwan began a process of legalizing prostitution Wednesday making the island the latest place in the world to decriminalize the world ’s oldest profession .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
In six months , authorities will stop punishing Taiwan sex workers after prostitutes successfully campaigned to be given the same protection as their clients , a government spokesman said .
“ Now the client gets off free , but the prostitute gets punished , and that ’s not fair , ” spokesman Su Jun-pin said .
Taiwan ’s cabinet will issue regulations within six months , when new regulations take effect , covering locations in Taiwan approved for prostitution .
“ It ’s like fishing , ” Su said .
“ The activity may be legal , but in some places you ca n’t do it . ”
Taiwan outlawed prostitution 11 years ago , but older sections of the capital Taipei still teem with underground sex workers in bars and night clubs on the upper floors of high - rise buildings .
The Collective of Sex Workers and Supporters , a Taipei - based advocacy group , estimates that 600,000 people are involved in sex-related jobs .
“ It ’s something the public has wanted for 12 years , ” said Collective CEO Chung Chun-tsu .
“ More and more people are agreeing with this consensus . ”
Local religious groups , however , have opposed the move .
Taiwan is the latest place to legalise prostitution .
New Zealand allowed brothels to operate freely in 2003 , when parliament narrowly voted to overturn 100 - year - old sex laws .
A court in Bangladesh decriminalized the trade in 2000 , but for women only .

Girls are playing video games in greater numbers according to a new 2009 study by NPD which was conducted last April .
The study finds that the Wii is the main culprit , saying that Nintendo ’s console has attracted a much larger number of females than ever before .
And it ’s not just girls who are playing the Wii either , boys are too .
The study shows that Wii usage overall has increased by 19 % from last year .
The biggest highlight of the study says that females now make up 28 % of the console gaming demographic , which is up from 23 % in 2008 .
Although the NPD study only concerns consoles , last April a Nielson study found that females make up a whopping 50 % of the PC gaming market and contributed to the high sales of The Sims 3 , which sold over 1.4 million copies in its first week .
Here are some other interesting numbers from the study :
* Extreme Gamers , as they are called in the study , played an average of 39 hours per week .
Although that may seem high , it ’s down from 46 hours last year .
* However Extreme Gamers still SPEND the most money on videogames , even if they actually MAKE the least amount of money ( they have the lowest overall average of household income ) .
* Extreme Gamers purchased an average of 24 titles in 2008 ’s holiday season .
* However Extreme Gamers only make up a petty 4 %(! ) of all gamers .
* 38 % of the time spent playing games by gamers , was spent playing them online .
Relatively the same as 2008 .
The Gamer Augmentation 2009 study by NPD Group was conducted in January 2009 with more than 20,000 participants ages 2-65 and above and includes data from the 2008 holiday season .
Survey data was weighted to portray gaming trends only within the US .

Dating sites for every niche , from Ayn Rand lovers to people with colostomy bags .
There ’s no stigma with online dating anymore .
There ’s really not .
There used to be .
About five or six years back , my friend Steve was on JDate and had a line in his profile like , “ If you do n’t mind , let ’s just tell everyone we met at a park or something . ”
And every single girl who wrote him commented on that line and told him they loved that idea .
But over time , online dating continued to shed its stigma .
At this point , the place where I met my girlfriend ( adult kickball ) would be considered nerdier than if I ’d met her on eHarmony .
( Which , from what I can tell , is just a website where neurosurgeons try to get hand jobs .
This will be !
An everlasting love ! )
And with de-stigmatization and popularity … along with every corporation in the web sphere realizing that loneliness equals dollar signs … online dating has become more and more niche - fied .
So behind the giants like Match.com there are literally thousands of smaller , more targeted online dating sites .
I plowed around and found the 11 dating sites that serve the most obscure niches .
I ’m reluctant to say these are weird dating sites or strange online dating sites because they ’re not , they ’re just … different .
Well , a few are weird .
1 | Lovebitten ( dating for vampires )
Their slogan is “ the best human / vampire dating site . ” ( ETA : A few people told me this site is a promotion for HBO ’s True Blood … damn .
But Vampersonals.com , GothicMatch.com and GothScene.com are all real and in this same genre . )
I blame Twilight for this .
I blame Twilight for a lot of things .
But … and I ’m just spitballing here …
I ’m guessing that if you go on Lovebitten , the vampire you get is going to look a lot less like Robert Patterson and more like a paler Perez Hilton wearing wax fangs .
If you ’re a vampire on the site , the human female you get probably is n’t going to be much like Kristen Stewart either .
Because she ’ll probably have at least some modicum of acting ability .
2 | Farmers Only
The website is called FarmersOnly.com , but there ’s a quote from the founder on the page that reads , “ You do n’t have to be a farmer . ”
I am confused by your brand messaging , sir .
3 | Tall Personals
Seems like a useful place for a giantess to find a man who can allow her to wear high heels and / or who can take her in the post … but there ’s a big controversy .
The first question of their FAQ reads “ I thought there was a criteria for membership , i.e. height F : 5 ’ 10 , M : 6 ’ 2 .
I find many normal height ( 5 ’8 women and 6 ’ 0 men ) people … why is this happening ? ”
The answer from the powers - that - be : “ This website is for tall people and their admirers .
Not everyone has the same definiton [ SIC ] of what is tall . ”
I smell a scam .
If I was n’t below average in height and vehemently against happiness for tall people , I ’d be outraged .
4 | The Atlasphere ( dating for Ayn Rand fans )
You can just imagine the girl telling her friends about her Ayn Rand date the night before .
“ So things were going well , we ate some appetizers , talked about personal rights , had some wine , used the word ‘ dystopia ’ 47 times and did n’t give homeless people any change .
Then we got back to his place and it turned out his fountainhead was as thick as Atlas Shrugged .
“ I never do THAT on a first date but , hey , rabid individualism does n’t always have to mean my night ends with me masturbating to photos of Steve Forbes . ”
5 | Equestrian Cupid
This would be cool if it was a site to hook up your horse with another horse .
Like a stud matcher .
And the female horses could rate the studs “ Do ’em ” or “ Glue ’em . ” ( HI - YO ! )
Sadly , it is not .
It is one of many , many dating sites oriented around bringing together people with similar taste in animals .
There ’s even a site called Date Me Date My Pet where people ’s animal compatibility is given more weight than any other measure or predictor of compatibility .
6 | DateCraft ( dating for World of Warcraft fans )
There are tons of “ geek ” - oriented dating sites , but this is my favorite .
Mostly because they display photos of their 15 most recent visitors … and when I went there , the ratio was 12 dudes / two girls / one I ’m not sure .
Which seemed juuuust about right .
7 | Pokerfaces.net ( dating for poker players )
Like any poker - related website that ends in a “ . net ” I have a feeling like this is a front for an online gambling site .
On the topic of poker and dating , I made the mistake of actually listening deeply to the lyrics of Lady Gaga ’s Poker Face the other day .

Fuck Their Crisis !
Ready to download flyer .
Download the pdf here .
A word to those who have lost , or who could lose their job because of the ‘ economic crisis ’ , a word to those whose boss has told you it was no longer ‘ profitable ’ to continue working , a word to those who may soon find themselves outcast and starving amid the wonders YOU have made .
YOU , who have the power to stop all armies , all industries , all economic theft if united in solidarity with your fellow worker , neighbour or women — please take note .
Have you not worked hard all of your life , since you were old enough for your labour to be of use in the production of wealth ?
Have you not toiled long and hard for somebody else ?
And in all those years of drudgery have you not produced thousand upon thousands of dollars ' worth of wealth , which you did not then , do not now — and unless you ACT — never will , own any part of ?
We produce about three times as much in an hour of work as we did in 1947 , but are we living or earning three times as well ?
Are we working a third less ?
Far from it .
In fact , wages are only slightly higher than they were 25 years ago .
We are working longer and harder than ever , while someone benefits from the fact that our work is producing more — and that someone is definitely not us .
Yet your employer told you that it was the ‘ economic crisis ’ and ‘ loss of profit ’ which cost you your job .
PROFIT , put simply , is ROBBERY — it is the surplus / extra value of your work / labour that goes straight into the bosses pocket .
When bosses talk of profit loss , not being ‘ productive ’ , or not being able to ‘ afford ’ to pay workers , it actually means less money for your boss , managers or company shareholders .
When work is relocated elsewhere they do so to exploit and pay someone else half the price they used to pay you .
Do n’t blame foreign workers or the regions / countries they move production to , blame the boss !
It is the ECONOMIC and INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM which must be changed .
No job summit , no re-shifting of the working week , no scheme by decree will ever solve the problem of the Capitalist system .
Capitalism needs to be ended , not propped up by government regulation .
An economy based on allowing the few to control , gamble and profit from YOUR labour is not only immoral , it does not work !
THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THIS .
Look at it this way — why should some NOT EVER HAVE TO WORK and not have to worry about how and when the bills / food will be payed ?
Why should some be unemployed or facing unemployment , hungry and hard - pressed , in a time when our society is equipped with the finest technology and the suitable means to feed the world THREE TIMES OVER , to REDUCE WORK TO A BARE MINIMUM , to end harmful industry and poverty , to use technology and machine FOR THE GOOD OF ALL ?
Why should you and your fellow workers be LOCKED OUT of the workplace by a handful of employers who have the keys to the machinery YOU work , and which YOU could use in a more sustainable , more human and more equal manner ?
The current crisis is not simply a bad ‘ patch ’ — it ’s seeds lie in the current economic system .
Unless you remove the root , the weed will always grow back .
Has this crisis not happened before ?
Will it not happen again ?
Any reforms that refuse to destroy the system itself falls short of the radical change we really need .
This ‘ crisis ’ is the direct result of CAPITALISM .
It is time to put it to an end .
We need to socialise and SELF - MANAGE the means of production ourselves — not through voting , not through reform — but OURSELVES .
We need to destroy the RELATIONS OF PRODUCTION — ways of working which gives someone else the power to make all the decisions and force us to be slaves , continually controlled , ordered around , watched over , over - worked and endlessly exploited .
Together we need to take direct control our own lives , our workplaces , and our communities .
Our task is to engage in DIRECT ACTION .
We cannot remain passive while factories continue to close and people lose their jobs .
While unions do nothing but negotiate redundancy packages .
While ‘ our ’ government sugar - coats the cyanide .
Price rises , rent rises , wage cuts and plant closures must be resisted with occupations , mass solidarity and collective action .
OCCUPY THE WORKPLACE !
Expropriate their wealth and share it with your workmates !
TOGETHER we have the power to put an end to Capitalism — without our brain and muscle not a single wheel would turn !
No flyer will ever alleviate the loss of an income , or feed those in need — but remember this — YOU did not create this economic crisis , the SYSTEM did .
ENDING THE SYSTEM WILL END THE CRISIS , and create a new system based on workers ’ self - management , mutual aid , de-centralisation , and equality .
Refuse to pay for THEIR crisis .
Refuse to be passive .
Now is time for us to take action .

Advertisement Footage of an officer shoving a man to the ground at a G20 protest minutes before he died raises concerns , London 's police chief has said .
Ian Tomlinson , 47 , who was walking home from work , suffered a heart attack several minutes after walking away from being pushed in central London .
His stepson Paul King has told the BBC the family " want answers " .
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said the force fully supported an inquiry into the death .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) , which is carrying out the inquiry , will examine the video footage showing Mr Tomlinson being pushed to the ground .
See a map of the scene Sir Paul said : " The images that have now been released raise obvious concerns and it is absolutely right and proper that there is a full investigation into this matter , which the Met will fully support . "
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the inquiry needed to be completed as soon as possible .
There was no reason for the officer to push him down
Paul King
The video , shot at 1929 BST at the Royal Exchange Passage on 1 April , initially shows Mr Tomlinson , who was going home from work and not protesting , walking away from a group of police officers .
Footage shows that he then received a two - handed push from an officer , landing heavily before remonstrating with the police .
Minutes later Mr Tomlinson collapsed and died of a heart attack , after walking to nearby Cornhill where he received first aid from police .
Mr King told BBC Radio 5 Live : " For the sake of the family here and his kids we just want justice ... you know , until everything does come out and we do get the evidence we need , we can't lay our father to rest . "
Reacting to the video , he said : " You can clearly see that my dad , Ian , had his hands in his pockets with his head down walking away .
" So there was no reason for the officer to push him down .
If he did do something wrong , then why not arrest him in the beginning ?
" We want answers now .
You know , it 's only minutes after [ that ]
Ian collapsed and had the heart attack . "

A New York fund manager recorded the footage , believed to be the last showing Mr Tomlinson alive .
He said he came forward with the video because the vendor 's family " were not getting any answers " .
The Liberal Democrats are now demanding a criminal inquiry .
The party 's justice spokesman , David Howarth , said the footage showed a " sickening and unprovoked attack " by police .
Daniel Sandford , BBC home affairs correspondent , said of the footage : " This is now going to raise some more serious questions about the police behaviour on that night .
" Why is it that one of the officers walks up to a man who appears to be walking away from him ? "
Sometimes it is n't clear , as a police officer , who is a protester and who is not
Peter Smyth of the Met Police Federation Peter Smyth , chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation , said some physical confrontation was inevitable during a large protest .
He told Radio 4 's Today programme : " On a day like that , where there are some protesters who are quite clearly hell - bent on causing as much trouble as they can , there is inevitably going to be some physical confrontation .
" Sometimes it is n't clear , as a police officer , who is a protester and who is not .
" I know it 's a generalisation but anybody in that part of the town at that time , the assumption would be that they are part of the protest .
" I accept that 's perhaps not a clever assumption but it's a natural one . "
' Quickly and thoroughly '
The Guardian newspaper obtained the video and has handed it to the IPCC .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Ms Smith said : " I 'm glad the IPCC themselves called for further evidence in order to be able to do that investigation as quickly and thoroughly as possible .
" And if it identifies - and I can understand people 's concerns - if it identifies the need for a criminal investigation , that then also needs to be pursued . "
A spokeswoman for the IPCC said : " We have recovered video footage from a national newspaper last night .
We are now in the process of analysing it , along with the other evidence we have obtained on the case . "
The police have well - established powers to use reasonable force if they think there is a threat either to themselves or the public , but these are enhanced during a protest or riot .
The key concept is that of " reasonable force " - i.e. force that is in proportion to the threat faced either by the public , the police or property
Thus " reasonable force " may literally range from putting a hand on someone 's elbow , to shooting them dead
The legislation governing police powers during demonstrations ( mostly the Public Order Act 1986 ) must also be seen in context of human rights ' legislation
Under European human rights ' laws the police are required to actively protect the public 's right to peaceful protest
Policing during a protest , therefore , is a negotiation between the rights of police to use reasonable force to protect the public , and their responsibility to allow peaceful protest to take place LOCATION OF IAN TOMLINSON AND G20 PROTESTS IN CITY OF LONDON 1 .

Step 1
Let 's check to see if jailbreaking or unlocking an iPhone makes sense for you by explaining what they actually mean : Jailbreaking allows you to load non-iTunes , third - party apps like these onto the phone , at your own risk .
Unlocking lets you use another company 's SIM card ( for T - Mobile or international travel ) .
That 's it .
And if you do n't like it , you can restore the original Apple software any time using iTunes ' Restore button — we 've done it plenty of times .
Advertisement
This guide is for the original iPhone , iPhone 3G and iPod Touch running the new iPhone 3.0 firmware .
If you own a 3GS , you 'll need to wait since it has n't been hacked quite yet .
But if you 're ready to hack your iPhone , grab your Mac or PC , iPhone and the USB adapter cable .
Let 's do this .
( Oh , and go to THIS LINK if you 'd rather see all of the instructions on one big page . )
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Step 2
Even if all you want to do is unlock the phone , you need to jailbreak it first , and that requires redsn0w , a Mac / PC jailbreaking program .
Download the official redsnow torrent files HERE , then download redsn0w via your Bittorrent client of choice .
Make sure you 've backed up your iPhone to your computer before moving forward .
That creates a data restore point in case you want to ditch the jailbreak apps .
Done ?
OK .
Last , if you 're moving your phone to T - Mobile , disable 3G before going on to the next step .

Step 3
Redsn0w works by patching the iPhone firmware file on your computer , then loading it onto your iPhone without using iTunes .
So open redsn0w .
Follow its instructions to select your .ipsw ( iPhone firmware ) file .
On Macs , you can find the file at Home Folder / Library / iTunes / iPhone Software Updates .
Or just download a new one from HERE .
Once you 've found your .ipsw , move on .
Advertisement
Step 4
Begin patching , but keep in mind this one setting : Redsn0w will ask if you want to install Cydia or Icy or Both .
( These are apps that can load programs on jailbroken phones and will be needed to unlock the phone later . )
JUST INSTALL CYDIA , NOT BOTH , OR ERRORS ARE PRONE TO ARISE LATER .
TRUST ME .
Once the .ipsw file is patched , make sure to plug in your iPhone then turn it off while still plugged .
When you see the screen " Click NEXT when your iPhone is both OFF and plugged in ... " go on to the next step .

Step 5
Now you need to put your phone into DFU mode to load the patched firmware .
You 'll hold the top power button for two seconds , then hold the Home button with it for 10 .
Then you 'll release the top button and just hold Home for 30 or so .
It 's not as hard as it sounds , and if you mess up you can just try again , but you need to pay attention , so make sure you 're holding your phone and watching the computer screen when you hit " next . "
Redsn0w will guide you through the pattern of holding the top and home buttons in timed succession .
If you 're successful , redsn0w will inform you that your phone is being jailbroken and you can stop holding the Home button .
If you 're not , redsn0w will reset the process and you 'll probably need to manually restart your iPhone .

Step 6
Wait as the jailbroken firmware loads onto your iPhone .
( You 'll see a disk drive on the phone 's screen , then this cute pineapple graphic as it installs . )
After a few minutes , the phone will reboot just as it does with official firmware .
Congratulations , your phone is jailbroken !
Most of you are done — just load Cydia ( which is now an app on your iPhone ) and search for apps you 'd like to install .
Others need to continue this tutorial for the unlock .

Step 7
If you want to unlock your original or 3G iPhone so it can take a T - Mobile or international SIM , follow these next steps .
You 're done with your computer , so make sure your iPhone is on a Wi -Fi connection .
We 're going to use Cydia to download and install ultrasn0w , which unlocks your iPhone .
Advertisement
Step 8
Cydia will first ask what kind of interface you 'd like .
I 'm no hacker , so I chose the graphical view .
Then Cydia will want to download at least 2 Essential Upgrades .
Let it by choosing " complete upgrade . "
If Cydia 's successful , you 'll see a bunch of install code and the option to " Close Cydia ( Restart ) . "
Hit that button .
( Note : If you are getting errors in this step , it may be because you installed both Cydia and Icy .
If you did that , restore your iPhone with official 3.0 firmware via iTunes and start the process over . )

Step 9
Reopen Cydia .
Go to Manage -> Sources -> Edit - >
Add and then enter " repo666.ultrasn0w.com " in the text field .
This should add ultrasn0w as a Cydia source so that you can download the ultrasn0w software .
Choose to return to Cydia and then click " Done " .
Advertisement
Step 10
Click the repo666.ultrasn0w.com listing under your Sources .
Click repo666.ultrasn0w.com again at the next screen ( redundant , we know ) .
Then click Install .
You 'll see a black screen with some text and , after a few seconds , it should read " Complete " .
Reboot your phone with your new SIM .

With the new Criminal Justice ( Miscellaneous Provisions )
Bill 2009 now past the Dail and Seanad and merely awaiting the near - formality of the Presidential signature , the only real decision as to when it comes into effect is the Minister’s .
However , one would hope that the Minister would utilise the granularity of the commencement process that was so heavily used in the Firearms section of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 , as several aspects of the language in this new Act - to - be seem to be unfit for purpose at first reading .
Consider , for our first example , Section 36 and Section 38 .
In Irish Firearms legislation , imports and exports are considered separately , by Section 16 and Section 17 of the Firearms
Act respectively , together with the additional regulations imposed on the system by EU directive 91/477/EEC and its corresponding SI in the Irish statute books ( SI 362 of 1993 ) .
Section 16 deals with exports , and has not been modified by the recent Act - to - be .
Section 17 , however , has .
The history of Section 17 is a relatively straightforward one by comparison to the more byzantine amendment histories of more contentious sections of the Firearms Acts , and is germane to the point here , so let us relate it .
The original Section written in 1925 has survived to this year with only one relevant amendment , made in 1964 ( a later amendment which modified the role of the Minister for Defence is not relevant to the matter at hand ) .
This 1964 amendment ( Section 21 of the 1964 Firearms Act ) is important as it introduced the following exemption from the importation controls that Section 17 defines , specifically stating that :
The restriction imposed by section 17 of the Principal Act on the importation into the State of firearms shall not apply in relation to the importation of a firearm by the holder of a firearm certificate in respect of the firearm which is in force .
It is this exemption that underlines not merely the standard importation procedure for personal importation of licenced firearms in Ireland , but which also permits a firearms certificate holder to travel abroad and return home with their firearm , whether to hunt or to attend a target shooting competition , without needing to become a firearms dealer and obtain an importation licence from the Department of Justice each and every time .
When the Firearms Acts were drafted in 1925 , the phenomenon of international travel was not a typical affair , except in the all - too - common case of the permanent emigrant , who was sadly not going to come under the aegis of Section 17 ( or indeed any of the Firearms Act ) anyway .
The hey - day of large international target shooting competitions , such as the famous Creedmore matches , was by that stage past ; the average income of a shooter was relatively low , and the modern phenomenon of the cheap package holiday to Majorca simply did not exist , even in the minds of the best science fiction writers of the day .
And for the rich or dedicated few who could go abroad , there was provision in 17 ( 4 ) for the Minister to grant an occasional licence on the strength of the firearms certificate held by the shooter in question .
By 1964 , the cost of travel had sufficiently changed , and the proximity of major shooting centres like that at Bisley in the UK created a requirement for this exemption to take an amount of useless administrative work from the Department of Justice , and it has seen extensive duty since 1964 , as Irish target shooters have brought home medals from almost every major shooting event in the World with the exception of the Olympics ( where we have yet to repeat the 1904 gold medal won in the London Games that year ) .
However , Section 38 of the Miscellaneous Provisions Act - to - be will repeal this much - used exemption by repealing all of Section 21 of the 1964 Act ; and Section 36 of the Act - to - be will replace completely Section 17 of the Firearms
Act with a new Section 17 , one which does not permit occasional or continuing licences to be granted to anyone bar a registered firearms dealer .
And in doing this , it is conceivable that the language chosen by the drafters will have some unintended – or worse , undefined – consequences .
Consider the proposed new Section 17( 1 ) :
17 . -(1 ) Without prejudice to the provisions of the Firearms ( Firearms Certificates for Non-Residents )
Act 2000 , no person , other than a registered firearm dealer , shall import into the State any firearm , ammunition , or prohibited weapon .
And contrast this to the original 17( 1 ) :
17 . —(1 ) No person shall import into Saorstát Eireann any firearm , ammunition , or prohibited weapon unless such import is authorised by a continuing licence granted under this section and in force at the time , or by an occasional licence granted under this section and relating to the specific firearm , ammunition or prohibited weapon so imported .
The rest of the new version of this Section is concerned with continuing and occasional import licences which can only be granted to Registered Firearms Dealers in Ireland .
Contrasting the two articles however , one wonders if the rest of the Section is wasted in this regard .
It seems an open question as to whether the complete lack of any mention in the new Section 17 of the requirement for an RFD to have authorisation for an import , or a licence to do so , would be grounds to argue in court that in fact no such licence is required for an RFD to import any firearm they so desire , regardless of its status as Restricted or otherwise .
Obviously possession of such a Restricted firearm once the import was complete would be problematical for anyone not licenced to possess it , but this would suggest that a personal importation of a Restricted firearm could be carried out by means of an RFD importing the firearm and the licenced owner taking possession of it at the collection point from Customs ; this would mean that the RFD would not require a Restricted firearms dealer ’s licence to import a Restricted firearm , albeit under a closely defined set of circumstances .
If this assessment is correct , then a single successful test case would mean that the stated intent of this new Section 17 , namely the elimination of personal imports where the individual does not leave the state to collect his or her firearm , will not have been realised .
It must be emphasised for clarity that such a test case is both necessary , and would have to defend against Section 17 ( 8 ) , which states that it is an offence to import a firearm without a licence :
(8) If any person imports into the State a firearm or prohibited weapon or any ammunition without or otherwise than in accordance with a licence under this section authorising such importation or , in the case of ammunition , in quantities in excess of those so authorised , or fails to comply with any condition named in a licence granted to him or her under this section , he or she shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be punishable accordingly .
However , even without the digression of this test case , the officially - stated intent of the Minister would appear to be thwarted here by poor wording .
The officially stated intent of the Minister in this area , as related by official sources in the Department of Justice , is to permit the personal importation of a firearm by an individual if that individual leaves the state to collect the firearm ; as well as to not interfere with return journeys by target shooters to other countries for competitions or similar events .
The form of import that was intended to be banned is where the shooter obtains a firearms certificate and has the firearm sent to him or her from abroad without leaving the state to collect it in person .
The proposed new Section 17 ( 1 ) , however , will not permit the importation of any firearm by any private individual – and with Section 21 of 1964 repealed , this no longer excludes returning to the State with a firearm for which that individual holds a valid firearms certificate .
This would not only impact upon the in -person collection of firearms from abroad by an individual who has been granted the relevant firearms certificate by the Gardai ; it would also mean that any target shooter leaving the state with his or her firearm to attend , say , the London Olympics in 2012 , could do so with relative ease under the same procedures used today , but on their return journey would find themselves in breach of 17 ( 1 ) should they attempt to enter the country with their firearm .
Circumventing this would be impossible unless a friendly Registered Firearms Dealer should arrange an importation licence to facilitate their return .
The cost of such service would of course have to include any importation licence processing fee .
Even the possession of a European Firearms Pass is of no benefit to the Irish shooter in this regard , as it makes provision only for Irish shooters travelling to other States , and no provision for the return journey ; no such provision was necessary when Section 21 of the 1964 Act existed , as any Irish shooter with a European Firearms Pass had it by way of possessing an Irish Firearms Certificate and thus had automatic permission to return to the country with their firearm .
Ironically , under the proposed new Section 17 , a non-resident coming to Ireland to shoot would have no difficulties – both the new Section 17 and the European Firearms Pass SI make explicit provision permitting their entry to the State with their firearms .
To most native Irish shooters , such a state of affairs would seem … unusually unbalanced .
Preventing this chaotic and embarrassingly disjointed situation was the entire point of Section 21 of the 1964 Act ; repealing it would seem to serve little purpose but to undermine the Minister ’s stated goals in this area , which is a curious state of affairs .
Perhaps holding off on commencing Section 36 and 38 until such time as the result of such commencement could be further considered would be the most prudent course .
The bitter truth of our modern world continues to crash down around us .
First , we learned that bottled water is n’t any healthier for you than the stuff that comes out of the tap .
And now we find out that organic food is apparently just another waste of money .
Boys and girls , you may as well buy a box of Cap ’n Crunch and drown a bowl of it in hormone - laced , pesticide - soaked milk produced by cows that consume chicken intestines and pork - related byproducts .
The latest assault to our long - treasured assumptions comes from The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine , where researchers unmasked the hard , cold realities about that expensive stuff in the fancy packaging .
When my wife saw the study , she shrieked : “ How could that be ? ”
But as Elaine Benes told Jerry : “ Oh , it be . ”
The study , commissioned by the British government and published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , reviewed 162 scientific papers over a 50 - year span .
The conclusion : “ A small number of differences in nutrient content were found to exist between organically and conventionally produced foodstuffs , but these are unlikely to be of any public health relevance .
“ Our review indicates that there is currently no evidence to support the selection of organically over conventionally produced foods on the basis of nutritional superiority . ”
The researchers noted that some previous reviews did show superior nutritional components to organic food , but there was never a comprehensive look at the issue .
Some of the differences that were found were due to the ripeness of the fruit or vegetable , or the type of fertilizer used .
Organic food consumption has fallen , by the way , but not because of this study , or studies like it .
The recession has affected shopping habits , with consumers returning to cheaper , mass produced foods .
The organic market had been seeing phenomenal growth – 26 percent per year – until recently .
Sales growth in Britain slowed to 1.7 percent in 2007 , according to a Reuters report .
Actually , this does n’t ’ mean I ’d never buy organic .
I like the idea , for example , of buying eggs from chickens that are running around a real yard , having the time of their lives hunting for worms , bugs and other assorted chicken delicacies .
And there - in lies the salvation of the organic food industry .
Some consumers will continue to believe that higher production standards are of some benefit , to themselves or the environment .
But it may be that the double - digit growth the business enjoyed for so long is coming to an end .

The North Korean Government says it is the Songun idea - based mode of counter - action for his country to decisively counter “ sanctions ” with retaliation and “ confrontation ” with all - out confrontation , according to one of the two largest press agencies .
Reuters says North Korea issued a statement saying it will weaponize all extracted plutonium .
And that “ confrontation sparked off by the unlawful strong arm actions of the U.S. and it ’s obedient UN Security Council ” created acute tension on the Korean Peninsula , according to one of the worlds two largest press agencies .
And that that the statement also describes the US and Security Council as having “ animosity against and rejection of a country that has a system different from theirs along with an arrogant and arbitrary view that a small country must obey a large one .
It says North Korea called its second nuclear test a self defensive measure conducted to cope with hostile acts of the U.S.
And says there can be no genuine peace in the absence of independence and equality .
And that North Korea says it did not break any international law by launching satellites .

Looks like I ’ll be paying for healthcare twice , like I paid for education twice .
Once for the government mandated and useless version ( Public Schools , Obama DeathCare ( TM ) ) and once in the Free Market for what works .
They can demand that I pay for their care .
It ’s a tax .
They ca n’t stop me from spending my own money after that in a private transaction with an individual doctor .

What is OffThe Grid terrain ?
OffThe Grid is a terrain technology we developed to bring detailed terrain data to in - game resolution without losing much detail .
Below you can see a comparison between heightmap terrain ( left ) , and OTG terrain ( right ) .
The OTG terrain is actually using fewer polygons .
How does it work ?
We start with a high - polygon terrain , and iteratively discard the least important polygon edge ( as defined by Dr. Michael Garland 's quadric - based polygonal surface simplification algorithm ) until we get down to our in - game polygon count target .
We then apply the normals and color map from our high - polygon terrain onto our simplified mesh .
Here is a wireframe image showing how OTG terrain uses less polygons by choosing them more carefully .
Why do we care ?
With traditional heightmap terrain , it is only possible to accurately represent soft , rolling hills - small details like rivers , sand dunes , and cliff faces are all smoothed away by the grid .
Using OffThe Grid terrain will allow us to portray a much wider variety of environments than we could with heightmap terrain .
Here is an example of a small mountain detail that is destroyed by the grid ( left ) .
Please keep in mind this is just our base terrain mesh -- we are going to add vegetation , detail maps , and other environmental detail on top of this .
Now that we have an effective technique to create an efficient base mesh , do you have any other ideas for how we can improve our terrain ?
I have a few ideas , but I 'm not sure which is the most important .
On war :
On the night before the Armistice , the soldiers at the front grabbed hold of anything that would make a noise – to celebrate , you see .
They let off stray shells , Verey lights and whatnot .
A lot of men , some who'd been right through the war , did n't make it through the night .
On love : I 've only ever kissed one girl : my Dorothy .
We met in 1915 and married in 1918 .
She died in 1970 .
I never gave my cherry away when I went to the front .
I know a lot of men who did .
On health : Superstition 's not for me .
And I 'm not much for medicine either .
I know my mind and my body better than anyone else .
On faith : I can see why people fall out with religion .
I last took communion in 1918 .
The Salvation Army were waiting for the boys to come out of the trenches .
' Cup of tea , soldier ? '
Yes please .
' There you go , son . '
The Church Army had set up a quarter of a mile away : ' Cup of tea , soldier ? '
Yes please .
' Penny ! '
I did n't like that .
They had all the money .
On care homes : Hang on to your independence .
I lived on my own until three years ago , when I went into a home .
I 'm very grateful , but I do n't like relying on other people .
On victory : I was on a spotter ship sent out to Jutland .
We saw these shells skimming across the sea , but we did n't know we'd been in a big battle until the next day , when the church bells rang out in Great Yarmouth to celebrate a naval victory .
And I did n't know it was a victory either !
On food :
You can't beat jellied eels from the Norfolk Broads .

And as long as I behave for other people .
Most people –especially in the West–know very little about the Middle East and the people that live there .
This lack of knowledge hurts our ability to understand , and engage in intelligent discussion about , current events .
For example , frighteningly few know the difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims , and most think the words “ Arab ” and “ Muslim ” are pretty much interchangeable .
They are n’t .
So here ’s a very brief primer aimed at raising the level of knowledge about the region to an absolute minimum .
Basics
Arabs are part of an ethnic group , not a religion .
Arabs were around long before Islam , and there have been ( and still are ) Arab Christians and Arab Jews .
In general , you ’re an Arab if you 1 ) are of Arab descent ( blood ) , or 2 ) speak the main Arab language ( Arabic ) .
Not all Arabs are Muslim .
There are significant populations of Arab Christians throughout the world , including in Lebanon , Syria , Jordan , Northern Africa and Palestine / Israel .
Islam is a religion .
A Muslim ( roughly pronounced MOOSE - lihm ) is someone who follows the religion .
So you would n’t say someone follows Muslim or is an Islam , just as you would n’t say someone follows Christian or is a Christianity .
Shia Muslims are similar to Roman Catholics in Christianity .
They have a strong clerical presence via Imams and promote the idea of going through them to practice the religion correctly .
Sunni Muslims are more like Protestant Christians .
They do n’t really focus on Imams and believe in maintaining a more direct line to God than the Shia .
People from Iran are also known as Persians , and they are not Arabs .
Arabs are Semites .
We ’ve all heard the term anti-Semitism being used — often to describe Arabs .
While antisemitism does specifically indicate hatred for Jews , the word “ Semite ” comes from the Bible and referred originally to anyone who spoke one of the Semitic Languages .
According to the Bible , Jews and Arabs are related [ Genesis 25 ] .
Jews descended from Abraham ‘s son Isaac , and Arabs descended from Abraham ’s son Ishmael .
So not only are both groups Semitic , but they ’re also family .
Sunni Muslims make up most of the Muslim world ( roughly 90 % ) .
1
The country with the world ’s largest Muslim population is Indonesia .
2
The rift between the Shia and Sunni started right after Muhammad ’s death and originally reduced to a power struggle regarding who was going to become the authoritative group for continuing the faith .
The Shia believed Muhammad ’s second cousin Ali should have taken over ( the family / cleric model ) .
The Sunni believed that the best person for the job should be chosen by the followers ( the merit model ) and that ’s how the first Caliph , Abu Bakr , was appointed .
Although the conflict began as a political struggle it now mostly considered a religious and class conflict , with political conflict emanating from those rifts .
Sunni vs. Shia | Arab vs. Non-Arab
Here ’s how the various Middle Eastern countries break down in terms of Sunni vs. Shia and whether or not they are predominantly Arab .
Keep in mind that these are generalizations ; significant diversity exists in many of the countries listed .
Iraq Mostly Shia ( roughly 60 % ) , but under Saddam the Shia were oppressed and the Sunni were in power despite being only 20 % of the population .

Iran Shia .

KABUL  Insurgents in Afghanistan , fighting from some of the poorest and most remote regions on earth , have managed for years to maintain an intensive guerrilla war against materially superior American and Afghan forces .
Arms and ordnance collected from dead insurgents hint at one possible reason :
Of 30 rifle magazines recently taken from insurgents ’ corpses , at least 17 contained cartridges , or rounds , identical to ammunition the United States had provided to Afghan government forces , according to an examination of ammunition markings by The New York Times and interviews with American officers and arms dealers .
The presence of this ammunition among the dead in the Korangal Valley , an area of often fierce fighting near Afghanistan ’s border with Pakistan , strongly suggests that munitions procured by the Pentagon have leaked from Afghan forces for use against American troops .
The scope of that diversion remains unknown , and the 30 magazines represented a single sampling of fewer than 1,000 cartridges .
But military officials , arms analysts and dealers say it points to a worrisome possibility :
With only spotty American and Afghan controls on the vast inventory of weapons and ammunition sent into Afghanistan during an eight - year conflict , poor discipline and outright corruption among Afghan forces may have helped insurgents stay supplied .
WHITE HOUSE , Tenn. , May 7 ( UPI ) --
Members of a Tennessee family said they were penalized by a retirement home for not giving at least 30 days notice before their mother died .
Randy Harrell said he received a security check refund from the Windlands Center in White House after his mother , Lucille Harrell , 81 , died at the facility March 20 , WSMV -TV , Nashville , reported .

" At that time , the check was $ 301 instead of $ 1,295 , which was her original deposit , " Harrell said .
He said facility bosses told him the money was deducted for not giving 30 days notice of his mother 's departure from the home , despite the reason being death .
Windlands Center manager John McCrory said the contract states that notice of leaving must be given at least 30 days in advance , although the document does not mention the word " death . "
" If they see they are having lots of problems , I even recommend them giving 30 - day notice at that time , " McCrory said .
" That way , it 'll cut off some of the costs . "

However , I 'm pretty sure Shigeru Miyamoto just had to cross the aisle in the West Hall of the LA Convention Center from Nintendo's booth to Sony 's in order to get some time with the PSP Go .
It makes sense he'd head over there , after all he's the one who is all about the innovation in gaming and the PSP
Go is pretty innovative or at least sexy looking .
Miyamoto did n't stop there though .
On Peter Molyneux 's Twitter it was announced that he demoed Milo to Miyamoto himself , allowing the creator of Mario to see just how well it all works .
No comment on his reaction to SkyNet Milo , but one has to wonder if he sees this as a threat , like Iwata must , or as an incredible invention he must get his hands on .
Either way , it 's good to see that most of the hatred between the companies is far more based on fanboy crap than actual dislike beetween industry pros .
Then again , I saw Miyamoto this year , and its pretty obvious that he could smile his way into anything .

From the San Diego Union : Calif .
officials concerned about new budget woes
" It 's entirely likely we will ultimately see further declines in revenue , which will almost certainly require further budget action , " said Assembly Minority Leader Sam Blakeslee , a Republican from San Luis Obispo .
...
Officials will also be watching monthly revenue reports from the Department of Finance and the controller 's office to look for signs of new trouble in the months ahead .
Of course , one of the key elements of the new California budget is to have the state use money that is normally allocated to cities .
So I expect layoffs at the local level in addition to the possibility of further state revenue declines .

Complacent Democratic politicians who avoided picking fights had adopted a " go along , get along " strategy with Fox News , hoping that if they were nice and cooperative , then Fox would be nice and cooperative in return .
That strategy did n't work .
In 2004 a study conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs found that during the height of the presidential campaign , just 13 percent of Fox News panelist comments about Democratic candidate Sen .
John Kerry were positive , compared to 50 percent positive for Bush .
That 's when key Fox News players , in front of and behind the cameras went bonkers .
Frustrated for weeks that they had no leverage in the unfolding debate within the Democratic Party about whether or not to go forward with the proposed alliance , the channel 's executives erupted with rage when they were finally , and unceremoniously , dumped .
On the air , Fox News pundit , Mort Kondracke claimed that the netroots campaign to cancel the debate amounted to " junior - grade Stalinism . "
The afternoon host John Gibson also invoked Stalin , as well as Trotsky .
And Bill O'Reilly claimed that the network 's online debate opponents " used propaganda techniques perfected by Dr. Joseph Goebbels , the Nazi minister of information .
They lie , distort , defame , all the time . " [ a little hysterical and a lot of blatant projecting ? ]
This came from [ Fox News head honcho Roger ]
Ailes himself : " The candidates that can't face Fox , ca n't face Al Qaeda .
And that 's what 's coming . "
( Did that mean Fox News was the equivalent of Al Qaeda ? )
Bloggers were thrilled that the CEO of the most successful cable news channel could n't resist becoming publicly embroiled in the debate over the debates ; they knew they 'd struck a nerve with Rupert Murdoch 's empire ,
The Fox News brand had been dented .
Brushing off suggestions
Tuesday the media is not critical enough of his administration , President Obama could n't help but take aim at one cable news channel in particular .
" It 's very hard for me to swallow that one , " Obama told CNBC when asked whether he thinks the media is too easy on him .
" First of all , I 've got one television station entirely devoted to attacking my administration . "
The interviewer quickly assumed Obama was referring to Fox News , a suggestion the president did n't disagree with .
" Well , that 's a pretty big megaphone , " he said .
" And you 'd be hard - pressed , if you watched the entire day , to find a positive story about me on that front . "
" We welcome people who are asking us some , you know , tough questions , " he continued .
" And I think that I 've been probably as accessible as any president in the first six months -- press conferences , taking questions from reporters , being held accountable , being transparent about what it is that we 're trying to do .
I think that , actually , the reason that people have been generally positive about what we 've tried to do is they feel as if I 'm available and willing to answer questions , and we have n't been trying to hide them all . "
I 'm in the middle of reading Eric Boehlert 's fantastic new book , Bloggers on the Bus and I was thrilled to be reminded of the heroic -- almost revolutionary -- efforts that bloggers made to delegitimize Fox News on behalf of the cowering wimps in the Democratic Party power structure .
The blogger victory over Fox was breathtaking and until Boehlert 's book , it has n't been properly analyzed or even recounted .
Bloggers went into action to derail the Nevada Democratic presidential debate on Fox .
When it started , it seemed like an impossible task .
Harry Reid , the epitome of the " complacent Democratic politicians who avoided picking fights , " wanted the debate to happen .

Johnny Depp , about to hit the big screen playing bank robber John Dillinger in “ Public Enemies , ” may yet bring Sebastian Dangerfield , the lead character of JP Donleavy ’s classic novel “ The Ginger Man , ” to life on the big screen .
The “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” star has been a longtime fan of Donleavy , the New York - born Irish - American author who has lived in Ireland for many years , and has spoken of his admiration for the book .
Donleavy has said in the past that Depp would be a good man to play the lead role , and recently told the Irish Independent that the project still has legs .
" I can't say too much , but we 've met a few times and discussed it , certainly , " Donleavy told the Irish independent .
“ He is a very literate and charming man .
It 's been a long - standing interest of his , so we will have to see . "
The novel , which was first published in 1955 was initially banned both the States and Ireland for obscene language , has never been adapted to film .
The 83 - year - old Donleavy has often commented that he did not know if he would live long enough to see it happen .
Depp is no stranger of things Irish , as he has often played with Shane MacGowan and counts him among his friends .
It 's Not Just That Global Warming Is Fake .
What Matters Is Why This Fakery Is Being Promoted .
July 3 , 2009
Global warming is based 100 % on junk science .
The most vocal promoters are not interested in the details of physical science .
They are interested in two things : political control over the general public and the establishment of international socialism .
Junk Science vs. Real Science
For a detailed , footnoted , 12 - page article , written by three scientists , two with Ph.D 's from CalTech , click here .
This paper was sent to tens of thousands of natural scientists in the United States .
Over 31,000 scientists have put their reputations on the line and signed a politically incorrect petition opposing the 1997 Kyoto agreement or protocol .
Here is a photocopy of a signed petition .
Here is a letter from a former president of the National Academy of Sciences .
He asks recipients of the petition to sign it .
Back in the 1970's , the bugaboo was the coming ice age , as this Time Magazine article promoted .
Not to be outdone , Newsweek got on board .
The article warned : " Climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climatic change , or even to allay its effects . "
Want more examples ?
Click here .
It , too , was based on junk science .
It , too , had the same solution : government control over the economy .
The goal never changes : government management over the economy .
The justification has changed .
If the voters wo n't accept control over their lives on the basis of one brand of junk science , maybe they will accept another .
As they used to say in the Nixon Administration : " Let 's run this up the flagpole and see if anyone salutes . "
Socialism 's Last Stand
The global warming movement is not about global warming .
It is about the creation of an international political control arrangement by which bureaucrats who favor socialism can gain control over the international economy .
This strategy was stated boldly by economist Robert Heilbroner in 1990 .
Heilbroner , the multi-millionaire socialist and author of the best - selling history of economic thought , The Worldly Philosophers , wrote the manifesto for these bureaucrats .
He did this in an article , " Reflections : After Communism , " published by The New Yorker ( Sept. 10 , 1990 ) .
In this article , he made an astounding admission .
He said that Ludwig von Mises had been right in 1920 in his article , " Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth . "
Mises argued that without private ownership , central planners could not know what any resource is worth to consumers .
With no capital market , the planners would be flying blind .
Heilbroner said that for 70 years , academic economists had either ignored this article or dismissed it without answering it .
Then Heilbroner wrote these words : " Mises was right . "
Heilbroner was one of these people .
There is no reference to Mises in The Worldly Philosophers .
This admission was the preliminary section of Heilbroner 's manifesto .
He was cutting off all hope by socialists that there is a theoretically plausible response to Mises .
The free market economy will always outproduce a socialist economy .
Get used to it , he said .
Then , in the second section , he called on his socialist peers to get behind the ecology movement .
Here , he said , is the best political means for promoting central planning , despite its inefficiency .
In the name of ecology , he said , socialists can get a hearing from politicians and voters .
The article is not online .
An abstract is .
Here is the concluding thought of the abstract .
The direction in which things are headed is some version of capitalism , whatever its title .
In Eastern Europe , the new system is referred to as Not Socialism .
Socialism may not continue as an important force now that Communism is finished .
But another way of looking at socialism is as the society that must emerge if humanity is to cope with the ecological burden that economic growth is placing on the environment .
From this perspective , the long vista after Communism leads through capitalism into a still unexplored world that roust [ must ? ] be safely attained and settled before it can be named .
Heilbroner did not care that a worldwide government - run economic planning system would not be called called socialism .
He just wanted to see the system set up .
Heilbroner 's peers got the message .
That was what Kyoto was all about .
Conclusion
If you like poverty , inefficiency , and bureaucratic controls over the economy , and therefore control over your choices , the " climate change " movement is ideal .
If you want to subsidize China and India , neither of which will enforce the rules laid down by unelected international bureaucrats , this movement is for you .
If you want to pay more for less energy , there is no better way than to pass the cap and tax bill which the House has passed .
It will be sent to the U.S. Senate next week .
The rest of us should oppose it .

The Secret : Keep Dough Refrigerated .
It is easy to have fresh bread whenever you want it with only five minutes a day of active effort .
Just mix the dough and let it sit for two hours .
No kneading needed !
Then shape and bake a loaf , and refrigerate the rest to use over the next couple weeks .
Yes , weeks !
The Master Recipe ( below ) makes enough dough for many loaves .
When you want fresh - baked crusty bread , take some dough , shape it into a loaf , let it rise for about 20 minutes , then bake .
Your house will smell like a bakery , and your family and friends will love you for it .
I was trained as a scientist , not as a chef .
That helped in developing a new process for homemade bread , but I never could have brought the recipes to this level without the rigorous standards of a professional — my co-author Zoë is a Culinary Institute of America - trained pastry chef .
Over several years , we found how to subtract the various steps that make the classic technique so time - consuming , and identified a few that could n’t be omitted .
Then Zoë worked some pastry chef magic .
She figured out that we could use stored dough for desserts , too .
It all came down to one fortuitous discovery : Pre-mixed , pre-risen , high - moisture dough keeps well in the refrigerator .
Like most kids , my brother and I loved sweets , so dessert was our favorite time of day .
We ’d sit in the kitchen , devouring frosted supermarket doughnuts .
“ Those are too sweet , ” my grandmother would say .
“ Me , I ’d rather have a piece of good rye bread , with cheese on it .
It ’s better than cake . ”
Secretly , I knew she was right .
I could finish half a loaf of very fresh , very crisp rye bread by myself , with or without butter .
The right stuff came from a little bakery in Queens .
The crust was crisp , thin and caramelized brown .
The crumb was moist and dense , chewy but never gummy , and bursting with tangy yeast , rye and wheat flavors .
It made great toast , too — and yes , it was better than cake .
When I was a kid , handmade bread was available all over New York City , and it was n’t a rarefied delicacy .
Everyone took it for granted .
It was not a stylish addition to affluent lifestyles ; it was a simple comfort food brought here by modest immigrants .
But now the ubiquitous corner shops turning out great European breads are no longer so ubiquitous .
And nobody ’s grandmother would ever have paid $ 6 for a loaf of bread .
So Zoë and I decided to do something about it .
Our book , Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day , is our attempt to help people re-create the great ethnic breads of years past , in their own homes , without investing serious time or effort .
Using our straightforward , fast and easy recipes , anyone can create artisan bread and pastries at home with minimal equipment .
Traditional breads need lots of attention , especially if you want to use a “ starter ” for that natural , tangy taste .
Starters need to be cared for .
Dough needs to be kneaded until resilient , set to rise , punched down , allowed to rise .
Few busy people can go through this every day , if ever .
What about bread machines ?
The machines solve the time problem and turn out uniformly decent loaves , but unfortunately , the crust is soft and dull - flavored , and without tangy flavor in the crumb ( unless you use and maintain a time - consuming sourdough starter ) .
By pre-mixing high - moisture dough ( without kneading ) and then storing it , daily bread baking becomes easy ; the only steps you do every day are shaping and baking .
As the dough ages , it takes on sourdough notes reminiscent of great starters .
Because this dough is wetter than most , it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks .
And kneading this kind of dough would add little to the overall product ; it can actually limit the volume and rise that you ’ll get .
That , in a nutshell , is how you make artisan breads with the investment of only five minutes a day of active effort .
A one - or two - week supply of dough is made in advance and refrigerated .
Mixing it takes less than 15 minutes .
Every day , cut off a hunk of dough and quickly shape it without kneading .
Allow it to rest briefly on the counter and then toss it in the oven .
We do n’t count the rest time or baking time ( usually about 30 minutes to an hour each ) in our calculation , because you can do something else while that ’s happening .
If you bake after dinner , the bread will still be fresh the next day ( higher moisture breads stay fresh longer ) , but the method is so convenient that you ’ll probably find you can cut off some dough and bake a loaf every morning before your day starts .
If you want to have one thing you do every day that is simply perfect , this is it !
Bread Making Ingredients and Equipment
Great breads really only require four basic ingredients : flour , water , yeast and salt .
The rest is detail .
Here ’s a short guide to the basic ingredients and equipment you ’ll need to make artisan loaves .
Unbleached , white , all - purpose flour :
Has adequate protein ( around 10 percent ) to create a satisfying “ chew , ” but low enough to prevent heaviness .
We prefer unbleached flours because bleaching removes some protein , not to mention adding unnecessary chemicals .
- Advertisement -
Whole wheat flour : Contains the germ and bran , both of which are healthful and tasty .
Together they add a slightly bitter , nutty flavor that many people enjoy .
Bread flour :
For chewier bread , substitute bread flour ( about 12 percent protein ) for all - purpose white flour by decreasing the amount slightly ( by about a quarter cup for every 6 cups of all - purpose ) .
Yeast :
Use what ’s readily available and buy in bulk rather than packets , which are much more expensive .
Salt :
Use non-iodized coarse kosher or sea salt .
Baking stone :
Use a high - ­quality , half - ­inch - ­thick stone .
The porous stone absorbs moisture from your dough , allowing a thin , crackling , crisp crust to form — one of the keys to artisanal baking .
Pizza peel :
This long - handled board helps slide doughs onto a hot stone .
A cookie sheet or cutting board will work , but will be more difficult to handle .
Broiler tray : A pan to hold water for steam during baking .
The Master French Boule Recipe
The artisan free - form loaf called the French boule is the basic model for all the no-knead recipes .
The round shape ( boule in French means “ ball ” ) is the easiest to master .
You ’ll learn how wet the dough needs to be ( wet , but not so wet that the finished loaf wo n’t retain its form ) and how to shape a loaf without kneading .
And you ’ll discover a truly revolutionary approach to baking :
Take some dough from the fridge , shape it , leave it to rest , then let it bake while you ’re preparing the rest of the meal .
Keep your dough wet — wetter doughs favor the development of sourdough character during storage .
You should become familiar with the following recipe before going through any of the others .
Mixing and Storing the Dough
1 . Heat the water to just a little warmer than body temperature ( about 100 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
2 . Add yeast and salt to the water in a 5 - quart bowl or , preferably , in a resealable , lidded container ( not airtight — use container with gasket or lift a corner ) .
Do n’t worry about getting it all to dissolve .
3 . Mix in the flour by gently scooping it up , then leveling the top of the measuring cup with a knife ; do n’t pat down .
Mix with a wooden spoon , a high - capacity food processor with dough attachment , or a heavy - duty stand mixer with dough hook , until uniformly moist .
If hand - mixing becomes too difficult , use very wet hands to press it together .
Do n’t knead !
This step is done in a matter of minutes , and yields a wet dough loose enough to conform to the container .
4. Cover loosely .
Do not use screw - topped jars , which could explode from trapped gases .
Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse ( or at least flatten on top ) , approximately two hours , depending on temperature .
Longer rising times , up to about five hours , will not harm the result .
You can use a portion of the dough any time after this period .
Refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and easier to work with than room - temperature dough .
We recommend refrigerating the dough at least three hours before shaping a loaf .
And relax !
You do n’t need to monitor doubling or tripling of volume as in traditional recipes .
Baking Bread on Baking Day
5 . Prepare a pizza peel by sprinkling it liberally with cornmeal to prevent the loaf from sticking to it when you slide it into the oven .
Sprinkle the surface of the dough with flour , then cut off a 1 - pound ( grapefruit - sized ) piece with a serrated knife .
Hold the mass of dough in your hands and add a little more flour as needed so it wo n’t stick to your hands .
Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on four “ sides , ” rotating the ball a quarter - turn as you go , until the bottom is a collection of four bunched ends .
Most of the dusting flour will fall off ; it does n’t need to be incorporated .
The bottom of the loaf will flatten out during resting and baking .
6 . Place the ball on the pizza peel .
Let it rest uncovered for about 40 minutes .
Depending on the dough ’s age , you may see little rise during this period ; more rising will occur during baking .
7 . Twenty minutes before baking , preheat oven to 450 degrees with a baking stone on the middle rack .
Place an empty broiler tray for holding water on another shelf .
8 . Dust the top of the loaf liberally with flour , which will allow the slashing , serrated knife to pass without sticking .
Slash a 1 ⁄ 4 - inch - deep cross , scallop or tick - tack - toe pattern into the top .
( This helps the bread expand during baking . )
9 . With a forward jerking motion of the wrist , slide the loaf off the pizza peel and onto the baking stone .
Quickly but carefully pour about a cup of hot water into the broiler tray and close the oven door to trap the steam .
Bake for about 30 minutes , or until the crust is browned and firm to the touch .
With wet dough , there ’s little risk of drying out the interior , despite the dark crust .
When you remove the loaf from the oven , it will audibly crackle , or “ sing , ” when initially exposed to room temperature air .
Allow to cool completely , preferably on a wire rack , for best flavor , texture and slicing .
The perfect crust may initially soften , but will firm up again when cooled .
10 . Refrigerate the remaining dough in your lidded ( not airtight ) container and use it over the next two weeks :
You ’ll find that even one day ’s storage improves the flavor and texture of your bread .
This maturation continues over the two - week period .
Cut off and shape loaves as you need them .
The dough can also be frozen in 1 - pound portions in an airtight container and defrosted overnight in the refrigerator prior to baking day .
Tips to Amaze Your Friends
The “ 6 - 3 - 3 - 13 ” rule .
To store enough for eight loaves , remember 6 - 3- 3 - 13 .
It ’s 6 cups water , 3 tablespoons salt , 3 tablespoons yeast , and then add 13 cups of flour .
It ’ll amaze your friends when you do this in their homes without a recipe !
Lazy sourdough shortcut .
When your dough container is empty , do n’t wash it !
Just scrape it down and incorporate it into the next batch .
In addition to saving cleanup , the aged dough stuck to the sides will give your new batch a head start on sourdough flavor .
Variation : Herb Bread .
Add a couple teaspoons of your favorite dried herbs ( double if fresh ) to the water mixture .

I have been merging packages from debian unstable to ubuntu karmic lately and every so often I need to look at a merge conflict .
Sometimes it ’s not so obvious why a conflict occurred at all .
Here ’s an example conflict from the libsepol package :
1 <<<<<<< libsepol -2.0.32-1ubuntu1 ( ubuntu ) 3 /*
Get the scope info for this boolean to see if this is the declaration , 4 * if so set the state */ 5 scope = hashtab_search ( state->cur->policy ->p_bools_scope.table , id ) ; 6 if ( ! scope ) 7 return SEPOL_ERR ; 8 if ( scope - > scope == SCOPE_DECL ) 9 base_bool -> state = booldatum -> state ; 10 11 ======= 13 /*

In order to avoid staring at the screen until my eyes start to bleed 🙂 I came up with the following bash function :
1 function dsec ( ) { 2 xclip - selection clipboard -o > /tmp/patch-seg-to-diff.txt 3 rm -f /tmp/ubuntu-snippet.txt /tmp/debian-snippet.txt 4 ed /tmp/patch-seg-to-diff.txt > /dev/null 2 >&1 <<- EOUBUNTU 5 1 d 6 /^=== / , $ d 7 wq /tmp/ubuntu-snippet.txt 8 EOUBUNTU 9 ed /tmp/patch-seg-to-diff.txt > / dev/null 2 >&1 <<-EODEBIAN 10 1,/^===/d 11 $ d 12 wq /tmp/debian-snippet.txt 13 EODEBIAN 14 echo ' diff - Nru /tmp/ubuntu-snippet.txt /tmp/debian-snippet.txt | colordiff | less ' 15 diff - Nru /tmp/ubuntu-snippet.txt /tmp/debian-snippet.txt | colordiff | less 16 }
I can now use my favourite editor to copy the conflicting code to the clipboard .
When invoked on the command line the dsec function reads the clipboard content and chops it apart ( using the ed utility ) into a debian and an ubuntu snippet respectively .
Subsequently it invokes the diff utility on the two snippets showing me how they differ .
1 --- /tmp/ubuntu-snippet.txt
2009-06-26 12:42:04.000000000 +0200 2 +++ /tmp/debian-snippet.txt
2009-06-26 12:42:04.000000000 +0200 3 @@ - 1,5 +1,5 @@ 4 /* Get the scope info for this boolean to see if this is the declaration , 5 - * if so set the state */ 6 + * if so set the state */ 7 scope = hashtab_search ( state->cur->policy->p_bools_scope.table , id ) ; 8 if ( ! scope ) 9 return SEPOL_ERR ;
Hmm .. this looks like a white space issue .
Since the dsec function printed the actual diff command to the terminal , I can copy and paste that to the command line and add the - b parameter so that the diff utility ignores changes in the amount of white space and ..
1 $ diff - Nrub /tmp/ubuntu-snippet.txt /tmp/debian-snippet.txt 2 $ echo $ ?
3 0
.. voila !
the diff output this time around is empty .
In order for this to work the utilities used must be installed , so e.g. on a ubuntu system run :
sudo apt - get install xclip colordiff
And .. do n’t forget to have fun 🙂
The " Made in Oregon " sign saga will continue over summer as everyone involved tries to reach another compromise .
The Historic Landmark Commission on Monday delayed a final decision on the case until Sept. 14 .
In a preliminary decision two weeks ago , the landmarks group rejected a compromise worked out between the University of Oregon and Portland Commissioner Randy Leonard .
Members objected to a part of the deal that would allow a big neon " O " on a water tower near the sign .
The UO leases the building under the " Made in Oregon " sign and originally wanted it to read " University of Oregon " but settled for " Oregon " and the water tower " O " .
At the hearing earlier this month , the sign owner and the university turned down a suggestion to separate the issues to allow approval of the " Made in Oregon " sign while hashing out a deal on the " O " -- instead , they chose to bank on appealing the case to the five - member City Council .
But the prospects of a successful appeal changed when Leonard indicated he would n't vote because he was involved in crafting the original compromise .
Now UO wants more time to find a solution .

Real - time ( Historical ) Analysis
Obama “ Yes , We Can ” Speech Ranked With “ I have a Dream , ” “ Tear Down this Wall , ” and JFK Inaugural
AUSTIN , TX , November 7 , 2008 –
In an analysis completed earlier today , the Global Language Monitor has found that Barak Obama ’s “ Yes , We Can ” speech delivered Tuesday night in Chicago ’s Grant Park ranked favorably in tone , tenor and rhetorical flourishes with memorable political addresses of the recent past including Martin Luther King , Jr. ’s “ I have a Dream ” speech , “ Tear Down his Wall , ” by Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy ’s Inaugural Address .
GLM has been tracking the language used in the debates and speeches of the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates throughout the bruising 2008 campaign .
In nearly every category , from grade level to the use of passive voice , even the average numbers of letters in the words he chose , Obama ’s Victory Speech was very similar in construction to the speeches of King , Reagan , and Kennedy .
“ As is appropriate for a forward - looking message of hope and reconciliation , words of change and hope , as well as future - related constructions dominated the address , ” said Paul JJ Payack President and Chief Word Analyst of the Global Language Monitor .
“ Evidently , Obama is at his best at connecting with people at the 7th to 8th grade range , communicating directly to his audience using simple yet powerful rhetorical devices , such as the repetition of the cadenced phrase ‘ Yes , we can ’ , which built to a powerful conclusion . ”
Obama ’s Victory Speech also was similar in construction to his 2004 Democratic Convention address , which first brought him to widespread national attention .
The statistical breakdown follows .
Obama Victory Speech Obama 2004 Convention Words 2049 2238 Sentences / Paragraph 1.8 2 Words / Sentence 18.9 20.0 Characters / Word 4.2 4.3 Reading Ease 72.4 67.5 Passive 11 % 8 % Grade Level 7.4 8.3
For a future - oriented message of hope and vision , the passive voice was used frequently but effectively .
Examples include : “ There will be setbacks and false starts .
It was also noted that Obama spoke in the authoritative voice of the future Commander - in - Chief with such phrasings as “ To those who would tear the world down – We will defeat you .
Some commentators noticed the absence of the collapse of the World Trade Center ’s Twin Towers in the 2001 terrorist attacks from Obama ’s catalog of significant events of last 106 years .
Historical comparisons follow .
Kennedy Inaugural Address 10.8 Reagan ‘ Tear Down This Wall ” 9.8 Lincoln “ Gettysburg Address ” 9.1 Martin Luther King : ” I have a dream ” 8.8 Obama 2004 Democrat Convention 8.3 Obama Victory Speech “ Yes , we can ” 7.4
‘ Change ’ , ‘ Cataclysmic Events , ’ and ‘ Global Financial Tsunami ’ Dominate Concerns of the American Electorate on Nov. 4
AUSTIN , TX , November 4 , 2008 –
In an analysis completed just hours before voting began for the 2008 the USPresidential Elections , Austin , Texas - based Global Language Monitor has found that ‘ Change ’ , ‘‘ Cataclysmic Events , ’ and ‘ Global Financial Tsunami ’ related words and phrases dominate the Top Ten Concerns of the American Electorate on Nov. 4 , 2008 .
The results are based on an on - going 18 - month analysis of the political language and buzzwords used throughout the presidential since before the primaries began .
GLM ’s uses its PQI Index , a proprietary algorithm that scours the global print and electronic media , the Internet , and blogosphere for ‘ hot ’ political buzzwords and then ranks them according to year - over - year change , acceleration , and directional momentum .
Political buzzwords are terms or phrases that become loaded with emotional freight beyond the normal meaning of the word .
Top Ten Concerns of the American Electorate on November 4 , 2008 .
Change is key .
Change favors Obama over McCain 3:2 .
Cataclysmic events , global warming and climate change rank higher than all other issues except change .
The Global Financial Tsunami and related terms permeate the Election and are that persistent low - humming heard in the background .
Experience counts .
Experience favors McCain over Obama 4:3 .
Concerns persist about Obama ’s experience , background , and the past and current associations .
Gender is an ongoing issue : it began with Hillary and continues with Palin though it is disguised in all sorts of well - meaning platitudes .
For many in this campaign , gender actually trumps race .
For all the concern about race , it actually seems to be having a positive effect on the Obama campaign , in its an ongoing , just beneath the surface dialogue , with millions ( both black and white ) voting for Obama precisely BECAUSE he is a black man .
This is viewed as separating us ( and in some sense liberating us ) from a long , painful history .
Working Class
Whites are used as a code word for whites who are working class .
No other moniker , such as Reagan Democrats or Soccer Moms has caught on in this election cycle .
Obama , to his great credit , is no longer perceived as ‘ aloof ’ .
What ’s the advantage of the PQI over the Polls ?
According to Paul JJ Payack , president and chief Word Analyst of the Global Language Monitor :
The PQI is , perhaps , the ultimate ‘ It is what it is ’ measurement of consumer ( and in this case Political ) sentiment .
The PQI simply measures the occurrence of certain words or phrases in the print and electronic media ( traditional or otherwise ) , on the Internet , and across the Blogosphere .
It is by its very nature non-biased .
When we take a statistical snapshot for the PQI there is no adjustment for ‘ underrepresented ’ groups , there are no assumptions about probability of turnout , the proportions of newly registered voters , traditional models , or expanded modularities .
Rather we take our measurements , check for the rate of positive or negative change in the appearance of a searched word or phrase ( what we call velocity and ) and publish our results .
In other words , it is what it is .
Using this methodology , GLM was the only media analytics organization that foresaw the ’04 electorate voting with their moral compasses rather than their pocketbooks . ”
The Top Political Buzzwords for the 2006 Midterm Elections included : Throes , Quagmire , Credibility , Global Warming , and Insurgency ; the Top Political Buzzwords from the 2004 Campaign included : Swift Boats , Flip Flop , Quagmire , Fahrenheit 911 , Misleader , and Liar !
Top 10 Things Political Buzzwords Tell Us About the Vote
AUSTIN , TX , November 3 , 2008 – In an analysis completed just 48 hours before the US Presidential Elections the Global Language Monitor has announced the final installment of the Top Political Buzzwords of the 2008 Presidential Campaign .
GLM , has been tracking the buzzwords in this election cycle for some eighteen months .
Political buzzwords are terms or phrases that become loaded with emotional freight beyond the normal meaning of the word .
For example , the word surge has been in the English - language vocabulary since time immemorial .
However , in its new context as an Iraq
War strategy , it inspires a set of emotions in many people far beyond the norm .
According to Paul JJ Payack , president and chief word analyst of Global Language Monitor :
The electorate appears to be more advanced in its thinking than either party ( or platform ) .
Taken as a whole their concerns center upon uncontrollable , cataclysmic events such as the global financial meltdown and climate change ( Nos. 1 and 2 ) , while raising taxes ( No. 22 ) or cutting taxes ( No. 27 ) are lesser ( though still important ) concerns .
The phrase ‘ Financial Meltdown ’ has broken into the Top 20 , jumping some 2600 % in usage over the last month .
Change is the topmost concern .
Though change from what to what remains a good question .
‘ Change ’ is , without question the top word of this campaign .
Both candidates are benefitting from the mantra ; however Obama holds a 3:2 edge over McCain in this regard .
The second - most discussed term of the campaign barely surfaces in most media reports , and this is the combination of ‘ Climate Change ’ and / or ‘ Global Warming ’ .
Experience ( No. 5 ) counts .
A lot .
Especially , if that experience can serve as a guide through the current series of cataclysmic events .
McCain edges Obama 4:3 in the experience category .
But Obama is given significant credit as a quick ( and judicious ) study .
Everyone is talking about race ( No. 16 ) except , apparently , the electorate .
It is a Top Twenty issue , but it ’s nestled between Joe the Plumber and Obama ’s smoking .
Iraq is now a non-issue .
No. 8 , Surge , and its apparent success has settled the argument , so it is no longer a question of victory or defeat .
Even Al Qaeda has lost its grip on the electorate , falling some 11 spots in two weeks .
Palin ( Nos 14 and 21 ) is a ‘ go - to ’ subject for the media and campaigns alike , with both sides thinking they gain tremendous leverage in her disparagement or apotheosis .
Tony Rezko ( No. 23 ) , Acorn ( No. 24 ) and Jeremiah Wright ( No. 26 ) are indeed issues , but are viewed as minor , settled or both for the Obama campaign .
The word , aloof , as related to Obama is no longer on the list .
At the end of the Primary season in June , it was No 14 and a major concern of the Obama campaign .
Obama has apparently overcome this sense of aloofness .
The ranking of Top Election Buzzwords of the 2008 Presidential Campaign and commentary follow .
Presidential Campaign PQI 11.2.08 Comment Rank 1 Change Obama has a 3:2 Edge over McCain with Change 2 Climate Change Global warming within 1/2 of 1 % for the overall lead 3 Gasoline Up 2 this week as prices fall 4 Recession Does a global financial meltdown count as a recession ?

The Final Debate : Obama & McCain Differ Sharply
Obama Doubles Use of Passive Voice Over McCain
Memorable quotes : ‘ Joe the Plumber ’ ; ‘ I am not President Bush ’
AUSTIN , TX , October 16 , 2008 .
In a linguistic analysis of the final Presidential Debate between Barack Obama and John McCain , the Global Language Monitor has found that in sharp contrast to prior debates , Obama ’s use of the passive voice doubled that of McCain ( and was significantly higher than he typically uses ) .
The use of the passive voice is considered significant in political speech because audiences generally respond better to active voice , which they tend to view asmore direct .
On a grade - level basis , Obama came in at 9.3 with McCain scoring grade level , while McCain came in at 7.4 , a difference of nearly two grade levels .
The debate took place at Hofstra University , in Hempstead , New York .
The statistical breakdown follows .
Obama McCain Difference Words 7,146 6,562 584 Words / Sentence 19.4 15.2 4.2 Sentences / Paragraph 2.0 2.1 5 % Characters / Word 4.4 4.4 0 % Passive Voice ( %) 6 % 3 % 100 % Reading Ease 62.6 68.6 6 Grade level 9.3 7.4 1.9
Using industry - standard tools and techniques , GLM ranks the candidates ’ speech on a number of levels from grade - reading level , the use of the passive voice , a reading ease score ( the higher , the easiest to understand ) , the number of words per sentence , the number of characters per word , among others .
“ Again , word choice and usage speaks volumes , ” said Paul JJ Payack , GLM ’s President & Chief Word Analyst .
“ Obama came in at a higher grade level than his previous efforts , but McCain was somewhat easier to understand .
Obama ’s significantly higher use of the passive voice combined with his frequent use of the word ‘ I ’ perhaps indicated an impatience with his opponent last witnessed in his debates with Hillary Clinton . ”
Obama used the personal pronoun , ‘ I ’ about 158 times in the debate , while McCain used the word some 119 times .
Memorable phrases include more than a dozen references to ‘ Joe the Plumber , ’ one Joe Wurzelbacher of Holland , Ohio , and John McCain ’s ‘ I am not President Bush ’ retort to Sen .
Obama ’s attempt to link his policies to those of the current president .
For comparison purposes , here is the results last week ’s Town - hall style debate .
That debate was notable in the fact that the questions asked by the audience outdistanced both Obama and McCain in the grade - level ranking category .
Perhaps , the most memorable phrase from that debate is perhaps ‘’ That one ! ” the term McCain used to refer to Obama .
“ That One ” has already joined GLM ’s analysis of the Top Political Buzzwords of the 2008 Campaign .

Top Buzzwords of Presidential Campaign : Two Weeks Out
Bailout falls dramatically ; Experience and Gender Rise
‘ Change ’ and ’ Global Warming / Climate Change ’ in statistical tie for top
.
AUSTIN , TX , October 21 , 2008 – In an analysis completed just two weeks before the US Presidential Elections the Global Language Monitor has announced that Change and Climate Change remain in a statistical tie for top spot in its list of Political Buzzwords of the 2008 Presidential Campaign , with Bailout falling dramatically to No. 13 .
“ In the Change ranking , Obama outdistanced McCain by a 3:2 ratio , while in the No. 2 Experience ranking , McCain held a 3:2 edge over Obama , ” said Paul JJ Payack , President and Chief Word Analyst of the Global Language Monitor .
“ Joe the Plumber and ACORN voter registration references broke into the Top 25 , at No. 19 and No. 22 , respectively .
In a related finding , Gender ( No. 10 ) continued to rise as Race ( No. 20 ) continued to fall , raising the question if gender is the new race ? ”
Political buzzwords are terms or phrases that become loaded with emotional freight beyond the normal meaning of the word .
For example , the word surge has been in the English - language vocabulary since time immemorial .
However , in its new context as an Iraq
War strategy , it inspires a set of emotions in many people far beyond the norm .

The US Presidential Election and the Financial Tsunami
Seemingly chaotic events reflect normalcy of new reality
A Historical Inflection Point
AUSTIN , TX , October 13 , 2008 .
The worldwide financial tsunami that has captured the attention of the worldwide media ( as well as governments , corporations , and ordinary citizens ) , has come to dominate one of the great quadrennial media events of the post - Modern era .
No , we are not referring to the Olympics , most recently held in Beijing , or even football ’s World Cup but , rather , the US Presidential elections .
The immediate effect of this unprecedented upheaval of global markets is the obfuscation of the clear lines of division offered by the opposing parties in the US Presidential Elections .
There is the sense that we are witnessing an unprecedented historical event ; historical in the sense that we now appear to be standing astride ( or atop ) a cusp in history , a delta , a decision point , what is now called a point of inflection or inflection point .
Watching the nightly news and reading the traditional ( for the last two centuries , that is ) media , one has the distinct sense that what they perceive as unprecedented almost chaotic circumstances is actually that of the normalcy of the new reality , that of communications at the speed of light that the internet has foisted upon us .
We keep hearing about this most unusual of election cycles , but this is only true when looking through the prism ( and historical construct ) of the traditional news gathering operations .
What is called the 24 - hour News Cycle is actually just the tip of the Tsunami washing over the planet at a steady speed and ever - quicker pace .
Indeed , the nature of the beast has n’t change at all .
It is our outdated techniques , that have n’t kept up with the new reality :
News now emanates at the speed of thought , from tens of thousands or , even , millions of sources .
The nature of a Tsunami is little understood other than the tremendous damage it unleashes when it washes ashore .
What we do know , however , is that a tsunami travels in exceedingly long waves ( tens of kilometers in length ) racing through the oceanic depths at hundreds of kilometers per hour .
Only upon reaching the shore is its true destructive power unleashed for all to see ( if they survive to witness it at all ) .
In the same manner , the traditional media become transfixed with the roiling surface seas but fail to acknowledge the more sustained and significant , movements occurring just beneath the surface .
The surface swirls about in fascinating eddies , but the true transformation is occurring as the nearly undetectable waves rush through the open sea only occasionally , though dramatically , making their way onto shore .
In the same manner , the traditional media focuses on the Twenty - four - hour News Cycle but seem to miss the strong and prevalent currents immediately beneath the surface .
They vainly attempt to tie global , transformative , and unprecedented events to relatively parochial events and forces ( the Reagan Years , the Clinton administration , Bush 41 and 43 , the deregulation initiatives of Alan Greenspan of ‘ 99 ) that are being all but overshadowed ( and –whelmed ) by unyielding and all - but - irresistible forces .
There is an almost palpable sense and correct sense that things are 1 ) changing forever , 2 ) out of our control ( or even influence ) , and 3 ) will have a direct impact upon the planet for generations to follow .
What we can control , and make sense of , however , is a candidate ’s wink , smirk or disdainful reference .
We can emphatically pin down our opponents into convenient sound bites , hopefully , contradict earlier sound bites .
Do you personally take responsibility for Climate Change ?
( Does the fact that New York City was beneath 5,000 feet of Ice a few dozen centuries ago influence your vote today ?
A yes or no will suffice ! )
Is your personal philosophy , whatever it might be , grounded in a belief system that I can systematically debunk and demean .
( Yes or no . )
Are you for or against atom smashers creating minuscule black holes that may or may not swallow up the Earth ?
( Answer yes and you are a barbarian ; answer no and you have absolutely no respects of the future prospects of the human race . )
Did you ever consider yourself a loser ( at any point in your life ) ?
Did you ever make the acquaintance of fellow losers ?
Nevertheless , the US Presidential Election will proceed to its own conclusion on the first Tuesday of November in the year two thousand and eight .
For the preceding five years , The Global Language Monitor has attempted to clarify the course ( and future course ) of human events as documented in the English language .
The tools at our disposal have sometimes allowed us to peer into events and trends that become , otherwise , obscured , by the ‘ noise ’ of the Twenty - four Hour News Cycle .
Our goal was , and continues to be , to extricate ( and explicate upon ) the true currents underpinning the events we call news , and to better understand what they mean and how they are perceived with the new media reality in mind .
For example , back in the days preceding the 2004 Presidential election cycle , GLM discovered the fact that once ideas , words and phrases were launched into the vast , uncharted , oceanic Internet , they do not , indeed , die out after twenty - four hours but , rather , travel in deep , powerful currents and waves ( not unlike those of a tsunami ) that only grow stronger as they make their ways to distant shores .
In this new reality , tsunami - like ideas pass through vast seas of information of the Internet , nearly undetected and often unmeasured , until they crash upon our shorelines , where their full power ( and possibly fury ) is unleashed .
The fact that we only entertain them for 24 hours before they are dispatched into the archives of what is considered ‘ past ’ or ‘ passed ’ and readily discarded , is beyond the point .
We often hear that ‘ we ’ve never seen anything like this ’ before .
Of course not .
Think back a few hundred years to other information revolutions , such as that introduced along with mechanical type .
What do you think the fortunate few thought when they first laid their eyes upon the works of Aristotle , the Bible , or the Arabic translations of Euclid ?
No one had ever seen anything like that before !
Indeed .
And astonishment will only become more so as the future unfolds .

Vice Presidential Debate Linguistic Analysis :
Palin at 10th Grade - level ; Biden at 8th Grade - level
Palin ’s use of passive voice highest of the 2008 Debates
AUSTIN , TX , October 3 , 2008 .
The first and only vice presidential debate of the 2008 Campaign has resulted in Governor Sarah Palin , the republican nominee for vice president speaking at a 10th - grade level , with Senator Joe Biden coming in at an 8th - grade level .
Also noteworthy was the fact that Gov. Palin ’s use of passive voice was the highest ( at 8 % ) of the 2008 Presidential and Vice Presidential debates thus far .
The analysis was performed by The Global Language Monitor ( www.LanguageMonitor.com), the Austin , Texas - based media analytics and analysis company .
GLM ranks the candidates ’ speech on a number of levels from grade - reading level , the use of the passive voice , ‘ a readability ’ score ( the closer to one hundred the easiest to understand , the number of words per sentence , even the number of characters per word .
The statistical breakdown follows .
Vice Presidential Debate Biden Palin Comment Grade Level 7.8 9.5 Palin raises a few eyebrows here .
No. of Words 5,492 5235
This is a surprise ; shows tremendous restraint on the normally loquacious Biden .
Obama used 20 more words per minute than McCain .
Sentences / Paragraph 2.7 2.6 A statistical tie .
Words / Sentence 15.8 19.9 Palin even outdistances professorial Obama on this one ; Obama scored 17.4 Characters / Word 4.4 4.4
Everyone has apparently learned that shorter words are easier to understand ( rather than monosyllabic words facilitate comprehension ) .
Passive Voice 5 % 8 % Passive voice can be used to deflect responsibility ; Biden used active voice when referring to Cheney and Bush ; Palin countered with passive deflections .
Ease of Reading 66.7 62.4 100 is the easiest to read ( or hear ) .
Notes :
The excessive use of passive voice can be used to obscure responsibility since there is no ‘ doer of the action ’ .
For example , ‘ Taxes will be raised ’ is a passive construction , while ‘ I will raise ( or lower ) taxes ’ is an active construction .
Five percent is considered average ; low for a politician .
By way of comparison , the ranking by grade - levels for historical debates follow .
Historical Contrasts Grade level Lincoln in Lincoln - Douglas Debates 11.2 Joseph Lieberman 9.9 Ronald Reagan 9.8 John F. Kennedy 9.6 Sarah Palin 9.5 Richard Nixon 9.1 Dick Cheney 9.1 Michael Dukakis 8.9 Bill Clinton 8.5 Al Gore 8.4 George W. Bush 7.1 George H.W. Bush 6.6 Ross Perot 6.3
The number of words is considered approximate , since transcripts vary .
The methodology employed is a modified Flesch - Kincaid formulation .
The First Presidential Debate :
A ‘ Linguistic Dead Heat ’ — with One Exception
In true professorial fashion , Obama averages some 20 more words per minute
AUSTIN , TX , September 28 , 2008 .
The first presidential debate of the 2008 Campaign resulted in a ‘ Linguistic Dead Heat ’ according to an analysis performed by The Global Language Monitor ( www.LanguageMonitor.com).
In nearly every category , from grade level to the use of passive voice , even the average numbers of letters in the words they chose , the candidates remained within the statistical margin of error with one major exception .
In the Number of Words category that the candidates used to convey their messages , Obama , in true professorial style , outdistanced McCain by some thousand words , which breaks down to an average of about 20 more words per minute .
“ As in the famous Harvard - Yale game back in 1968 , Harvard declared a victory after securing a come - from - behind 29 - 29 tie .
In the same manner , both sides of the debate have declared victory in an essential deadlocked outcome , ” said Paul JJ Payack , President and Chief Word Analyst of GLM .
“ Look at the debate as a football game .
Both teams effectively moved the ball .
However , the scoring was low , and the quarterbacks performed as expected , with McCain completing some excellently thrown passes only to have others blocked by Obama .
Obama ’s ground game was more impressive , churning out the yards — but he had difficulty getting the ball over the goal line . ”
The statistical breakdown follows .
McCain Obama Sentences per paragraph 2.2 2.1 Words per sentence 15.9 17.4 Characters per word 4.4 4.3 Passive voice 5 % 5 % Ease of Reading ( 100 Top ) 63.7 66.8 Grade Level 8.3 8.2 Number of words ( approximate ) 7,150 8,068
Notes :
The excessive use of passive voice can be used to obscure responsibility since there is no ‘ doer of the action ’ .
For example , ‘ Taxes will be raised ’ is a passive construction , while ‘ I will raise ( or lower ) taxes ’ is an active construction .
Five percent is considered low .
McCain ’s Speech Comes in at the Third Grade Level : Most Direct of all Speakers at Either Convention
Palin & Obama Speech Score Nearly Identical
AUSTIN , TX , .
September 7 , 2008 . ( Updated )
In an exclusive analysis of the speeches made at the recently concluded Political Conventions , the Global Language Monitor found that John McCain spoke at a third - grade reading level , meaning that his speech was the easiest to comprehend of any delivered at either convention .
GLM also found that McCain scored the lowest of all convention speakers in use of the passive voice , an indication of ‘ direct ’ talk .
Higher use of the passive voice is often viewed as an indicator of ‘ indirect ’ and more easily confused speech because the doer of the action is obscured : ‘ Taxes will be raised ’ rather than ‘ I will raise taxes ’ .
In another finding , GLM found that both Sarah Palin ’s and Barack Obama ’s widely viewed ( 38 and 37 million viewers respectively ) , and much - acclaimed acceptance speeches were closely similar , delivered in language that reflected a ninth grade ( 9.2 and 9.3 respectively ) ‘ reading level ’ .
The basic language evaluation stats are shown below .
John McCain Sarah Palin Barack Obama 3.7 9.2 9.3 Grade Level 1.9 1.3 1.5 Sentences / Paragraph 4.4 4.4 4.4 Letters / Word 79.1 63.8 64.4 Reading Ease ( 100 is easiest ) 6.4 19.5 22.1 Words / Sentence 2 % 8 % 5 % Passive Sentences
It is widely believed that shorter sentences , words and paragraphs are easier to comprehend .
The analysis was performed by the Global Language Monitor , the media analysis , and analytics agency .
GLM used a modified Flesch - Kincaid formula for its analysis , which measures factors such as the number of words in a sentence , the number of letters in a word , the percentage of sentences in passive voice , and other indicators of making things easier to read and , hence , understand .
This release comes in at the second year of college level ( 14 + ) .
Warning : do not incorporate these words into presidential addresses .

Obama ’s “ Yes , We Can ” Speech Ranked with “ I have a Dream , ”
“ Tear Down this Wall , ” and JFK Inaugural
AUSTIN , TX , November 7 , 2008 –
In an analysis completed earlier today , the Global Language Monitor has found that Barack Obama ’s “ Yes , We Can ” speech delivered Tuesday night in Chicago ’s Grant Park ranked favorably in tone , tenor and rhetorical flourishes with memorable political addresses of the recent past including Martin Luther King , Jr. ’s “ I have a Dream ” speech , “ Tear Down his Wall , ” by Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy ’s Inaugural Address .
GLM has been tracking the language used in the debates and speeches of the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates throughout the bruising 2008 campaign .
In nearly every category , from grade level to the use of passive voice , even the average numbers of letters in the words he chose , Obama ’s Victory Speech was very similar in construction to the speeches of King , Reagan , and Kennedy .
Obama Speech a Winner
“ Complete Coverage of the for a forward - looking message of hope and reconciliation , words of change and hope , as well as future - related constructions dominated the address , ” said Paul JJ Payack President and Chief Word Analyst of the Global Language Monitor .
“ Evidently , Obama is at his best at connecting with people at the 7th to 8th - grade range , communicating directly to his audience using simple yet powerful rhetorical devices , such as the repetition of the cadenced phrase ‘ Yes , we can ’ , which built to a powerful conclusion . ”
Obama ’s Victory Speech also was similar in construction to his 2004 Democratic Convention address , which first brought him to widespread national attention .
The statistical breakdown follows .
Obama Victory Speech Obama 2004 Convention Words 2049 2238 Sentences / Paragraph 1.8 2 Words / Sentence 18.9 20.0 Characters / Word 4.2 4.3 Reading Ease 72.4 67.5 Passive 11 % 8 % Grade Level 7.4 8.3
For a future - oriented message of hope and vision , the passive voice was used frequently but effectively .
Examples include : “ There will be setbacks and false starts .
It was also noted that Obama spoke in the authoritative voice of the future Commander - in - Chief with such phrasings as “ To those who would tear the world down – We will defeat you .
Some commentators noticed the absence of the collapse of the World Trade Center ’s Twin Towers in the 2001 terrorist attacks from Obama ’s catalog of significant events of last 106 years .
Historical comparisons follow .
Kennedy Inaugural Address 10.8 Reagan ‘ Tear Down This Wall ” 9.8 Lincoln “ Gettysburg Address ” 9.1 Martin Luther King : ” I have a dream ” 8.8 Obama 2004 Democrat Convention 8.3 Obama Victory Speech “ Yes , we can ” 7.4

Change ’ , ‘ Cataclysmic Events , ’ and ‘ Global Financial Tsunami ’
Dominate Concerns of the American Electorate on Nov. 4
AUSTIN , TX , November 4 , 2008 –
In an analysis completed just hours before voting began for the 2008 the USPresidential Elections , Austin , Texas - based Global Language Monitor has found that ‘ Change ’ , ‘‘ Cataclysmic Events , ’ and ‘ Global Financial Tsunami ’ related words and phrases dominate the Top Ten Concerns of the American Electorate on Nov. 4 , 2008 .
The results are based on an on - going 18 - month analysis of the political language and buzzwords used throughout the presidential since before the primaries began .
GLM ’s uses its PQI Index , a proprietary algorithm that scours the global print and electronic media , the Internet , and blogosphere for ‘ hot ’ political buzzwords and then ranks them according to year - over - year change , acceleration , and directional momentum .
Political buzzwords are terms or phrases that become loaded with emotional freight beyond the normal meaning of the word .
Top Ten Concerns of the American Electorate on November 4 , 2008 .
1. Change is key .
Change favors Obama over McCain 3:2 .
2. Cataclysmic events , global warming and climate change rank higher than all other issues except change .
3 . The Global Financial Tsunami and related terms permeate the Election and are that persistent low - humming heard in the background .
4. Experience counts .
Experience favors McCain over Obama 4:3 .
5. Concerns persist about Obama ’s experience , background , and the past and current associations .
6 . Gender is an ongoing issue : it began with Hillary and continues with Palin though it is disguised in all sorts of well - meaning platitudes .
7 . For many in this campaign , gender actually trumps race .
8 . For all the concern about race , it actually seems to be having a positive effect on the Obama campaign , in its an ongoing , just beneath the surface dialogue , with millions ( both black and white ) voting for Obama precisely BECAUSE he is a black man .
This is viewed as separating us ( and in some sense liberating us ) from a long , painful history .
9. Working Class
Whites are used as a code word for whites who are working class .
No other moniker , such as Reagan Democrats or Soccer Moms has caught on in this election cycle .
10 . Obama , to his great credit , is no longer perceived as ‘ aloof ’ .
What ’s the advantage of the PQI over the Polls ?
According to Paul JJ Payack , president and chief Word Analyst of the Global Language Monitor :
The PQI is , perhaps , the ultimate ‘ It is what it is ’ measurement of consumer ( and in this case Political ) sentiment .
The PQI simply measures the occurrence of certain words or phrases in the print and electronic media ( traditional or otherwise ) , on the Internet , and across the Blogosphere .
It is by its very nature non-biased .
When we take a statistical snapshot for the PQI there is no adjustment for ‘ underrepresented ’ groups , there are no assumptions about probability of turnout , the proportions of newly registered voters , traditional models , or expanded modularities .
Rather we take our measurements , check for the rate of positive or negative change in the appearance of a searched word or phrase ( what we call velocity and ) and publish our results .
In other words , it is what it is .
Using this methodology , GLM was the only media analytics organization that foresaw the ’04 electorate voting with their moral compasses rather than their pocketbooks . ”
The Top Political Buzzwords for the 2006 Midterm Elections included : Throes , Quagmire , Credibility , Global Warming , and Insurgency ; the Top Political Buzzwords from the 2004 Campaign included : Swift Boats , Flip Flop , Quagmire , Fahrenheit 911 , Misleader , and Liar !
Top 10 Things Political Buzzwords Tell Us About the Vote
AUSTIN , TX , November 3 , 2008 – In an analysis completed just 48 hours before the US Presidential Elections the Global Language Monitor has announced the final installment of the Top Political Buzzwords of the 2008 Presidential Campaign .
GLM , has been tracking the buzzwords in this election cycle for some eighteen months .
Political buzzwords are terms or phrases that become loaded with emotional freight beyond the normal meaning of the word .
For example , the word surge has been in the English - language vocabulary since time immemorial .
However , in its new context as an Iraq
War strategy , it inspires a set of emotions in many people far beyond the norm .
According to Paul JJ Payack , president and chief word analyst of Global Language Monitor :
The electorate appears to be more advanced in its thinking than either party ( or platform ) .
Taken as a whole their concerns center upon uncontrollable , cataclysmic events such as the global financial meltdown and climate change ( Nos. 1 and 2 ) , while raising taxes ( No. 22 ) or cutting taxes ( No. 27 ) are lesser ( though still important ) concerns .
The phrase ‘ Financial Meltdown ’ has broken into the Top 20 , jumping some 2600 % in usage over the last month .
Change is the topmost concern .
Though change from what to what remains a good question .
‘ Change ’ is , without question the top word of this campaign .
Both candidates are benefitting from the mantra ; however Obama holds a 3:2 edge over McCain in this regard .
The second - most discussed term of the campaign barely surfaces in most media reports , and this is the combination of ‘ Climate Change ’ and / or ‘ Global Warming ’ .
Experience ( No. 5 ) counts .
A lot .
Especially , if that experience can serve as a guide through the current series of cataclysmic events .
McCain edges Obama 4:3 in the experience category .
But Obama is given significant credit as a quick ( and judicious ) study .
Everyone is talking about race ( No. 16 ) except , apparently , the electorate .
It is a Top Twenty issue , but it ’s nestled between Joe the Plumber and Obama ’s smoking .
Iraq is now a non-issue .
No. 8 , Surge , and its apparent success has settled the argument , so it is no longer a question of victory or defeat .
Even Al Qaeda has lost its grip on the electorate , falling some 11 spots in two weeks .
Palin ( Nos 14 and 21 ) is a ‘ go - to ’ subject for the media and campaigns alike , with both sides thinking they gain tremendous leverage in her disparagement or apotheosis .
Tony Rezko ( No. 23 ) , Acorn ( No. 24 ) and Jeremiah Wright ( No. 26 ) are indeed issues , but are viewed as minor , settled or both for the Obama campaign .
The word , aloof , as related to Obama is no longer on the list .
At the end of the Primary season in June , it was No 14 and a major concern of the Obama campaign .
Obama has apparently overcome this sense of aloofness .
The ranking of Top Election Buzzwords of the 2008 Presidential Campaign and commentary follow .
Presidential Campaign PQI 11.2.08 Comment Rank 1 Change Obama has a 3:2 Edge over McCain with Change 2 Climate Change Global warming within 1/2 of 1 % for the overall lead 3 Gasoline Up 2 this week as prices fall 4 Recession Does a global financial meltdown count as a recession ?

It was earlier reported that most of the passengers were Armenian , but officials later said the majority on board were Iranian .
A Caspian Airlines spokesman told Reuters news agency up to 25 of the passengers were Armenians .
There were also two Georgians on the plane , which had 153 passengers and 15 crew .
' Big explosion '
One witness said the Tu-154 circled briefly looking for an emergency landing site , while another said the plane 's tail was on fire .
A man who saw the crash said the aircraft exploded on impact .
ANALYSIS
Jon Leyne , BBC News
Iran has a notoriously bad air safety record .
Because of sanctions imposed by the United States , Iran relies on an increasingly ageing fleet of airliners , and has trouble buying spares .
There are tales of aircrew buying spare parts on flights to Europe , then sneaking them back to Iran in the cockpit .
While those sanctions do n't apply to aircraft from Russia and Ukraine , many planes from those countries in the Iranian fleet also appear well past their best .
For some people , flying in Iran can be a nerve - wracking experience .
Stepping on board , it often becomes quickly apparent you are in a plane that has done many years service .
There are also frequent delays because of the shortage of aircraft .
Iranian engineers and aircrew do their best to keep their fleets in service .
" I saw the plane crashing nose - down .
It hit the ground causing a big explosion .
The impact shook the ground like an earthquake .
Then , plane pieces were scattered all over the fields , " 23 - year - old Ali Akbar Hashemi told AP news agency .
Eight members of Iran 's national junior judo team and two coaches were on the flight , heading for training with the Armenian team .
Mohammad Reza Montazer Khorasan , the head of the disaster management centre at Iran 's health ministry , said : " All people aboard ... the crashed plane are dead , " according to AFP news agency .
Television footage showed a massive crater in a field , with smouldering debris over a wide area .
The Qazvin Fire Department Chief said : " The area of the disaster is very wide and wreckage of the crashed plane has been thrown around as far as 150 to 200m . "
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad offered his condolences to the families of the victims .
IRANIAN PLANE CRASHES Feb 2006 : Tupolev crashes in Tehran , kills 29 people Dec 2005 : C - 130 military transport plane crashes near Tehran , kills 110 Feb 2003 : Iranian military transport plane crashes in south of country , kills all 276 on board Dec 2002 : Antonov 140 commuter plane crashes in central Iran , kills all 46 people on board Feb 2002 : Tupolev crashes in west Iran , kills all 199 on board
Air disasters timeline The plane was built in Russia in 1987 .
It was the third deadly crash of a Tupolev Tu-154 in Iran since 2002 .
The BBC's Jon Leyne says Iran 's civil and military air fleets are made up of elderly aircraft , in poor condition due to their age and lack of maintenance .
Since the Islamic revolution of 1979 , trade embargoes by Western nations have forced Iran to buy mainly Russian - built planes to supplement an existing fleet of Boeings and other American and European models .

Advertisement The Stig , a mystery driver who tests high - performance cars on Top Gear , has been " revealed " as Michael Schumacher .
The seven - times Formula 1 champion dressed as the show 's famous driver and removed his helmet during an interview with presenter Jeremy Clarkson .
However , an appalling driving performance by Schumacher at the end of the show cast doubt on the " revelation " .
Clarkson told viewers : " I do n't think Michael Schumacher is the Stig " .
The presenter had earlier revealed in his column in the Sun that Stig 's identity would be a " staggering surprise " to viewers .
" As a television moment , it 's up there with Neil Armstrong walking on the ... corpse of JR Ewing , " he added .
Earlier , a BBC spokesman said : " As Jeremy said , in tonight 's Top Gear Stig will remove his helmet for the first time . "
I do n't think it was for real - it was good fun and nice to see Schumacher playing along
Peter Lawton , What Car ? magazine
After the show , a BBC spokeswoman would not confirm whether or not Schumacher was the genuine Stig , or a stunt to mark the first episode of a new series of Top Gear .
" You have to bear in mind that Top Gear is an entertainment programme .
We never reveal who or what The Stig is , " she said .
But fans of the show remain unconvinced as to his identity .
One fan , James2001 , wrote on a Digital Spy forum : " You 're very gullible if you believe it really is him . "
Another fan , Mijath , said : " People 's fascination with the identity of The Stig mystifies me .
Tonight 's unveiling was always going to be a joke , and a brilliant one it was . "
Peter Lawton , consumer editor of What Car ?
magazine told the BBC he thought it was " a nice publicity stunt " .
" I do n't think it was for real - it was good fun and nice to see Schumacher playing along , " he said .
He also said he knew who the real Stig was , but added : " My lips are sealed . "
Perry McCarthy , a former Formula 1 driver , was the original Stig , wearing black overalls for his appearances .
He left the show in 2003 - when a " new " Stig , dressed in white , took over - and later disclosed his identity in an autobiography .

What happened
At a town hall event in New Mexico , President Obama urged Congress to send him a bill to sign by Memorial Day that would curb what he described as misleading and abusive lending practices by credit card companies .
The House passed a version of the bill in April ; the Senate is still working on its version .
( The New York Times )
What the commentators said
The final law is up to House and Senate negotiators , said Brian Tumulty in New York ’s Lower Hudson Journal News , but the “ most significant change ” in both versions would bar lenders from raising your interest rate on existing debt , if you pay your bill on time .
They can raise your rates , with 45 days ’ notice , but you ’d always pay back the part of your card debt with the highest rate first .
Another possible change could dim plastic 's allure , said Sudeep Reddy in The Wall Street Journal , by making it easier for retailers to offer discounts to customers paying with cash or check .
Stores pay 1.5 percent to 2 percent of credit card transactions to the card networks , and a Senate amendment would keep the networks from punishing stores for offering cash - only prices .
The credit card industry has “ unsavory practices ” that need changing , said Barbara Kiviat in Time , but the problem “ is n’t just credit card companies — it ’s you , too . ”
There is “ piles of evidence ” that people make dumb money decisions when they pay with credit cards , even when they know the risks and fees .
Nothing Congress does can change that .
In a first concrete look at how California ’s fiscal crisis may dramatically reshape higher education in the state , California State University Chancellor Charles B. Reed said Tuesday that he will ask the university ’s trustees to approve an additional student fee hike of 15 % to 20 % for this fall , and enrollment reductions of 32,000 students in the year to follow .
The proposed increase would come on top of a 10 % hike approved in May and would bring average yearly undergraduate fees to $ 4,688 to $ 4,861 .
That figure includes additional charges set by each campus , but not the cost of books , transportation or room and board .
The chancellor ’s announcement , at a special board session called to grapple with a funding shortfall of at least $ 584 million projected for the Cal State system when the state budget is finally issued , came after Cal State faculty members bitterly denounced the trustees and Reed .
The professors said the Cal State leaders had failed to fight hard enough for new taxes or other fiscal measures to forestall precipitous cost-cutting .
“ The policy of appeasement has been a failure , ” California Faculty Assn .
President Lillian Taiz told Reed and the board .

Reed said the university system , which starts fall classes in August , was running out of time and options .
“ I have been in the public service business for more than 40 years , and never before have I ever seen such a devastating cut , ” the chancellor said .
Speaking to faculty members who lined up to publicly rail at administrators , Board of Trustees Chairman Jeffrey Bleich said , “ If we divide and demonize each other . . . and point fingers and pretend it ’s someone else ’s fault , we ’re not going to advance at all . ”
Reed said much of the fee hike will be covered by financial aid increases and education tax breaks promised by the Obama administration , but several professors called that assertion “ ludicrous . ”

“ What this means is dreams deferred , poverty entrenched and the door to the middle class slammed firmly on poor and working - class people , ” said Rita Ledesma , a professor at Cal State L.A .
Reed said he would call on presidents of the system ’s 23 campuses to make further reductions totaling $ 192 million .
He also warned of mass layoffs if the faculty union fails to go along with a separate proposal for a university - wide , two - day - a - month furlough plan designed to eliminate $ 275 million of the $ 584 - million budget gap .
Two unions representing 21,000 of Cal State ’s workforce of 47,000 employees have tentatively agreed to either accept or negotiate the furlough proposal .
But the faculty association , which represents 23,000 instructors and tenure - track professors , had demanded more information about how the overall deficit would be cut before polling its members .
Enrollment at Cal State , the nation ’s largest four - year university system , currently stands at about 450,000 students .
Administrators plan to slash 2010 - 11 enrollment by raising admission standards , pushing up application deadlines and limiting admission for some students to their local campuses , officials said .

To spread the reductions throughout the four - year institutions , officials said , the restrictions will apply to transfer students as well as incoming freshmen .
The university used similar methods in an attempt to reduce enrollment for the school year just ended by 10,000 students , but managed to bring the number down by only 3,000 to 4,000 .
Reed said he will issue final recommendations by July 10 , in time for a July 21 vote by the trustees .
“ It ’s going to be a very sad year for California students and their families , ” said Cal State Fullerton professor Diana Guerin , a member of the university ’s statewide academic senate .

A " man on the street " who turned out to be a intern for China 's state - run CCTV appeared on a CCTV newscast to testify about the evils of porn websites .
China 's controversial " Green Dam " censorship program is purportedly designed to block such memory - erasing evils for the protection of Chinese citizens .
Gao ( shown here during the broadcast ) complained that the pornographic content on Google.cn was particularly harmful .
He said in the interview , ' I have this fellow student and he 's been curious about these kinds of things .
He visited porn Web sites and ended up becoming absent - minded for a while . '
Which sounds pretty authentic .
Viewing porn sites causes memory loss .
Not a known syndrome but possible , possible .
Some viewers doubted the truth of Gao 's comments and suspected that he had been coached beforehand .
So an Internet search was carried out — there is no place to hide — and it appears that he is a current intern with CCTV .
His page on the popular Chinese social networking site Xiaonei.com seemed to support the claim that he was working for the state broadcaster at the time of the interview .
I recently spent an evening with Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche , the Tibetan lama who has been dubbed “ the happiest man in the world . ”
True , that title has been bestowed upon at least a few extremely upbeat individuals in recent times .
But it is no exaggeration to say that Rinpoche is a master of the art of well - being .
So how did he get that way ?
Apparently , the same way you get to Carnegie Hall .
Practice .
Photo by and courtesy of Marvin Moore
I ’ve had the pleasure of knowing Rinpoche a bit over the years , and always found him in good cheer .
This meeting was no different .
When I called him at his Manhattan hotel to arrange to get together before we were to discuss his new book , “ Joyful Wisdom ” at the 92nd St. Y , he told me he was in the middle of a shower – but not in the usual sense .
The shower , he told me , had run out of hot water midway .
When he called the front desk , he was told to wait several minutes and there would be more hot water .
In this situation , I probably would have been peeved .
But as Rinpoche told me this , he was laughing and laughing .
The only momentary glitch I ’ve witnessed — a few years back — was slapstick : he sat down in an office chair with a faulty seat that suddenly plunged several inches with a thump .
Once when this chair had done the same to me I cursed and groused about it for a while .
But Rinpoche just frowned for a second — and the next moment he was his upbeat self again .
Quickness of recovery time from upsets is one way science takes the measure of a happy temperament .
While annoyances like these are hardly life ’s greatest tests , handling them gracefully takes a composure that few of us seem to have at our disposal .
Mingyur Rinpoche was not born into wealth and comfort .
He spent his earliest years in a remote Himalayan village lacking even the most basic amenities .
Nor was he a lucky winner in the genetic lottery for moods .
In his book he recounts being extremely anxious as a child in Nepal , having had what a Manhattan psychiatrist would likely diagnose as panic attacks , and how he cured himself of this chronic anxiety by making his fears the focus of his meditation .
He has had to earn his good cheer .
Rinpoche seems eclectic in studying paths to well - being , including Western recipes .
A few years ago , he attended a five - day meeting at the Mind & Life Institute that brought together a group of neuroscientists and the Dalai Lama to discuss ways to overcome destructive emotions .
He found that the Western scientific findings on emotions had much in common with his own approach to cultivating well - being .
But when it comes to his own pursuit of happiness , Buddhist theory and practice are Rinpoche ’s chosen tools .
He has done several years - long meditation retreats , under the tutelage of some of the most renowned Tibetan masters .
Of course , what we mean by “ happiness ” can be elusive , what with the myriad varieties of good feeling running from ecstasy to equanimity .
One flavor of happiness at which Rinpoche seems to excel has been well - studied by scientists specializing in how emotions operate in our brains .
Richard Davidson , who heads the Laboratory for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin , has found one distinct brain profile for happiness .
As Davidson ’s laboratory has reported , when we are in distress , the brain shows high activation levels in the right prefrontal area and the amygdala .
But when we are in an upbeat mood , the right side quiets and the left prefrontal area stirs .
When showing this brain pattern , people report feeling , as Davidson put it to me , “ positively engaged , goal - directed , enthusiastic , and energetic . ”
Mingyur Rinpoche came to Davidson ’s lab as one of a dozen or so meditation adepts , each of whom had put in anywhere between 10,000 and 50,000 lifetime hours of meditation .
Research on expertise in any skill shows that world - class champs have put in at least 10,000 hours of practice ; these were Olympic - level meditators .
One of the first findings from the research showed that when these adepts meditated on compassion , activity in key brain areas increased up to 100 percent , notably more than was the case in a control group who were taught the same meditation practice .
The more lifetime hours of practice , the greater the increases tended to be .
All this seems to confirm the idea that in the realm of positive moods , as in nearly every endeavor , worldly or spiritual , practice matters .
So can we all get a taste of Rinpoche ’s bliss ?
Davidson worked with Jon Kabat - Zinn , a teacher of mindfulness meditation from the University of Massachusetts Medical Center , to see how a group of novices might gain from these methods .
Kabat - Zinn , who has pioneered this contemplative method with medical patients to ease their symptoms , taught mindfulness at a high - stress biotech company ; these beginners meditated for 30 minutes a day for eight weeks .
Davidson ’s measures showed that after the eight weeks they had begun to activate that left prefrontal zone more strongly — and were saying that instead of feeling overwhelmed and hassled , they were enjoying their work .
So while the Calvinist strain in American culture may look askance at someone sitting quietly in meditation , this kind of “ doing nothing ” seems to do something remarkable after all .
Of course , there ’s no guarantee of greater happiness from meditation , but the East has given us a promising path for its pursuit .
Another fruit of these spiritual practices seems to be a healthy dose of humility .
When Rinpoche told my wife that he was being billed as “ the happiest man in the world , ” he laughed as though that were the funniest joke he ’d ever heard .

Procrastinating variables ( PVar s ) are meant to be used in cases where you want to give someone a value that you do not have available yet , but will definitely have ready by the time that they need to use it .
PVar s have the advantage that you do not make the user of your value execute some kind of unwrapping routine in order to get access to the value within .
For example , this is useful when you are constructing closures that you want to go ahead and construct now even though some of the values that they contain are not available yet .
PVar s are implemented with a lazy thunk that reads from an IORef ; before the IORef is written to , it contains _|_ ( an exception with a descriptive error message ) so that an error is raised in the user code if the variable is accidently accessed before the value is ready .
Four years ago today , this country suffered a terrible atrocity at the hands of terrorists : 52 people were killed and many more horribly injured .
I stood at the dispatch box that day and spoke of the need to face down this barbarism .
In the subsequent weeks and months , I was proud of the calm and just way that the ordinary British citizen dealt with this assault and of the comparative absence of people trying to make scapegoats of the ordinary , decent Muslim community .
I was proud of the courage , sense of honour , tolerance and justice of our citizens at home .
I am afraid that I cannot be so complimentary about the actions of our government abroad .
In the last year , there have been at least 15 cases of British citizens or British residents claiming to be tortured by foreign intelligence agencies with the knowledge , complicity and , in some cases , presence of British intelligence officers .
One case – that of Binyam Mohammed – has been referred to the police by the attorney general , which implies that there is at least a prima facie case to answer .
The most salient others include Moazzam Begg , Tariq Mahmoud , Salahuddin Amin and Rashid Rauf , all in Pakistan , Jamil Rahman in Bangladesh , Alam Ghafoor in United Arab Emirates , and Azhar Khan and others in Egypt .
For each case , the government have denied complicity , but at the same time fiercely defended the secrecy of their actions , making it impossible to put the full facts in the public domain , despite the clear public interest in doing so .
Although the combined circumstantial evidence of complicity in all these cases is overwhelming , it has not so far been possible – because of the government 's improper use of state secrecy to cover up the evidence – to establish absolutely clear sequences of cause and effect .
In the case I am about to describe , we can follow the entire chain of events from original suspicion , through active encouragement of the Pakistani authorities to arrest and through the subsequent collaboration between UK and Pakistani agencies .
This is the case of Rangzieb Ahmed , a convicted terrorist , whose treatment I can describe in some detail .
As the house will realise , the account I am about to relay comes from several sources .
I cannot properly give my sources , given the vindictive attitude of this government , particularly the Foreign Office , to whistleblowers .
Indeed , in this case of Rangzieb Ahmed , the authorities were so paranoid that they threatened to arrest a journalist for reporting facts stated in open court .
Nevertheless , although I am prevented from naming my sources , I can say that I am confident of these facts beyond reasonable doubt .
I will not , of course , disclose any names , or anything that discloses intelligence agency techniques – other than torture – or other issues that threaten national security .
I should say that the individual whose case I am going to describe is not someone for whom I have any natural sympathy .
He is a convicted – indeed , self - confessed – terrorist .
So what I am talking about today is just as much about defending our own civilised standards as it is about deploring what was done to this man in the name of defending our country .
In 2005 - 06 , Rangzieb Ahmed was a suspected terrorist who was kept under surveillance for about a year before leaving the country to go first to Dubai and on a subsequent trip to Pakistan .
During that time , evidence was collected against him , on the basis of which he was later convicted .
Let me repeat that point , as it is very important to my subsequent argument – during that time , evidence was collected , on the basis of which he was subsequently convicted .
Despite the authorities having that evidence , he was – astonishingly – not arrested but instead allowed to leave the country .
To understand how odd this decision was , we should remember that this was only a year after the tragedy of 7/7 , after which agencies were criticised for allowing terrorist suspects to leave the country to go to Pakistan .
Since they knew he was leaving , since they knew where he was going , and since they had more than enough evidence to arrest him , allowing him to leave was clearly deliberate .
That the authorities knew his itinerary is demonstrated by the fact that he was kept under surveillance when he was in Dubai .
He later went on to Pakistan , where the Pakistani authorities were warned of his arrival by the British government .
The British intelligence agencies wrote to their opposite numbers in Pakistan – the members of the directorate for inter-services intelligence – suggesting that they arrest him .
I use the word " suggest " rather than " request " or " recommend " because of the peculiar language of the ISI 's communication .
No doubt the minister can confirm that for himself by asking to see the record .
We also know that the intelligence officer who wrote to the Pakistanis did so in full knowledge of the normal methods used by the ISI against terrorist suspects that it holds .
That is unsurprising , as it is common public knowledge in Pakistan .
The officer would therefore be aware that " suggesting " arrest was equivalent to " suggesting " torture .
Rangzieb Ahmed was arrested by the ISI on 20 August 2006 .
Once he was taken into custody in Pakistan by the ISI , the Manchester police and MI5 together created a list of questions to be put to him .
MI5 arranged for those questions to be given to the ISI .
Rangzieb Ahmed was viciously tortured by the ISI .
He says , among other things , that he was beaten with wooden staves the size of cricket stumps and whipped with a 3ft length of tyre rubber nailed to a wooden handle , and that three fingernails were removed from his left hand .
There is a dispute between Ahmed and British intelligence officers about exactly when his fingernails were removed , but an independent pathologist employed by the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that it happened during the period when he was in Pakistani custody .
Rangzieb was asked questions , under torture , about the UK by ISI officers .
He claims that he saw " UK / Pakistan Secret " on the question list used by the ISI .
That was presumably the list put together by the Manchester police and MI5 .
After about 13 days , he was visited by an officer from MI5 and another from MI6 .
He claims to have told them , during questioning , that he had been tortured .
They deny that , but it is significant that they did not return for further interviews .
By that stage , MI5 policy was not to return after any interview in which the subject claimed that he had been tortured .
The British agents did not return , but Rangzieb was subsequently questioned by Americans .
Is it also an extraordinary , if sinister , coincidence that the Manchester police accessed Rangzieb Ahmed 's medical records within days of the MI5 / MI6 interview ?
Why would they do that if he was in perfect health ?
Rangzieb Ahmed was kept in detention by the Pakistani authorities for a total of 13 months – first at the ISI centre , then at Rawalpindi and then at Adiyala jail – before being deported to the United Kingdom in September 2007 .
He was tried and convicted of terrorist offences in late 2008 – according to the prosecution , entirely on the basis of evidence obtained while he was under surveillance in the UK and Dubai in 2005 - 06 .
I cannot imagine a more obvious case of the outsourcing of torture , a more obvious case of " passive rendition " .
Let me recap .
Rangzieb
Ahmed should have been arrested by the UK in 2006 , but he was not .
The authorities knew that he intended to travel to Pakistan , so they should have prevented that ; instead , they suggested that the ISI arrest him .
They knew that he would be tortured , and they arranged to construct a list of questions and supply it to the ISI .
The authorities know full well that this story is an evidential showcase for the policy of complicity in torture , should that evidence ever come out .
One way in which the in camera veil of secrecy might be lifted would be a civil case by Mr Ahmed against the government for their complicity in torture .
Part of that process would involve challenging the in - camera rulings and revealing the details of agency involvement .
Just such a case was being considered by Mr Ahmed , and on 20 April this year he was visited in prison by his solicitor and a specialist legal adviser to discuss it .
Mr Ahmed tells us that a week later he was visited by an officer from MI5 and a policeman .
That is the story told today on the front pages of the Daily Mail and the Guardian .
During the course of their visit they said that they would like him to help in the fight against terror with information about extremism .
This is perfectly proper .
However , the sinister part of this visit was an alleged request to drop his allegations of torture : if he did that , they could get his sentence cut and possibly give him some money .
If this request to drop the torture case is true , it is frankly monstrous .
It would at the very least be a criminal misuse of the powers and funds under the government 's Contest strategy , and at worst a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .
I would normally be disinclined to believe the word of a convicted terrorist .
However , when he initially told his lawyer about it , he did not want to pursue the matter .
Also , in common with many other criminals , after the scandal of the taping of the current minister of state , Department for Transport , the right honourable member for Tooting [ Sadiq Khan ] , on a prison visit , he believes all these meetings are taped and he says this will back him up .
Given that belief , he is unlikely to have made an allegation that would be so easily proven wrong .
I do not believe the conversation was taped , but it would have been videoed and this could be used to check his story .
For reasons of policy and natural justice , it is imperative that the Crown Prosecution service investigates this allegation immediately , but that is not my principal concern today .
My questions to the minister are as follows .
First , will he undertake to look at the in - camera court records and the records of the police and intelligence agencies so that he can confirm for his own satisfaction that my account of the handling of Rangzieb Ahmed pre-trial is correct ?
That process should take only a few days .
Secondly , will he publish the current guidelines governing the agencies handling the suspected torture so that we can see whether the UK authorities broke those guidelines or whether it was the policy that was at fault ?
The prime minister has undertaken to publish the new guidelines , so if the minister cannot publish the current ones , can he explain why his approach is different to the prime minister's ?
Thirdly , I believe , but cannot be certain to an evidential level , that the judge in the court case intimated that disciplinary action should be considered within the intelligence agencies .
Was this done ?
If not , why not ?
Finally , can the minister now announce a proper judicial inquiry into the allegations of UK complicity in torture , since it is now clear that there is not just circumstantial evidence but hard evidence in government records for ministers to read , if they had but eyes to see ?
Let me conclude by saying that our handling of the subject of torture has , in my view , been completely wrong .
The Americans have made a clean breast of their complicity , while explicitly not prosecuting the junior officers who were acting under instruction at a time of enormous duress and perceived threat after 9/11 .
We have done the opposite .
As things stand , we are awaiting a police investigation that will presumably end in the prosecution of the frontline officers involved .
At the same time , the government are fighting tooth and nail to use state secrecy to cover up crimes and political embarrassments to protect those who are probably the real villains in the piece – those who approved these policies in the first place .
The battle against terrorism is not just a fight for life ; it is a battle of ideas and ideals .
It is a battle between good and evil , between civilisation and barbarism .
In that fight , we should never allow our standards to drop to those of our enemies .
We cannot defend our civilisation by giving up the values of that civilisation .
I hope the minister will today help me in ensuring that we find out what has gone wrong so we can return to defending those values once again .

A few months ago , when I first discovered the existence of a place called “ The Army Experience Center ” in a Philadelphia mall that enticed kids as young as 13 to not only play violent video games , but allowed them access to a real Apache helicopter , M - 16 rifle , automatic machine guns , an armored humvee and a tank , I decided that everyone who cared about our youth should be outraged and take action .
We could n’t allow the Department of Defense to use this first - of - its - kind center , which cost an initial investment of $ 12 million , and has over 14,000 sq. ft. of space which houses a “ Tactical Operations Center ” , gaming stations allowing kids to play the most violent video games available , and the back room where they can touch and feel weapons created for killing , to produce any more around the Country .
We decided to shut it down .
Yesterday , over 300 people from all over the northeast decided to take action .
A coalition of over 30 anti-war , peace and justice groups rallied at St. Luke ’s Church on Knights Road , just about a mile away from the Franklin Mills Mall , which houses the AEC .
Everyone was fired up about shutting this atrocity down , and you could feel the energy in the crowd that ranged from Viet Nam vets to Iraq Vets to young students .
Drums were heard , speeches and rallying cries to “ Shut it Down ! ”
With that , everyone took to the street and marched to the mall , ready to deliver the “ Private Criminal Complaint ” to the commanding officer at the AEC , as well as to the mall owners , who allow this place to exist .
The complaint states in part “ the Army Experience Center is involved in “ Endangering the Welfare of a Child ” and “ Criminal Solicitation of a Minor ” and “ Corruption of Minors ” – soliciting underage persons to act in a violent manner , and thereby supporting criminal and corrupt behavior … ”
Over 300 activists entered the mall banging drums and screaming their rallying cries to “ SHUT IT DOWN ! ” and “ WAR IS NO GAME ! ” as the complaint was handed to the recruiting officer in charge .
The complaint was read out loud , which had a profound effect on everyone who was there shopping , and visiting the various eateries .
People stopped to listen , and really could n’t believe what was happening .
I myself , was part of a group of protesters who donned death masks and the names of fallen soldiers and stood directly in front of the AEC , which was at that point surrounded by police .
But that did n’t stop us from demanding that it be closed and they should cease and desist corrupting our youth .
Those of us in death masks stood silently by and watched the rest of the group shouting at the recruiters .
“ Stop stealing our kids ” “ No wars for empire ” , “ SHAME ON YOU ! ” to the endless pounding of drums .
It seemed to me that the recruiters were becoming a bit unnerved , and the police were becoming extremely impatient .
This was a peaceful protest , as we were not only exercising our first amendment right of “ freedom of speech ” , but trying to get our youth de-militarized , and away from the clutches of bloody war games .
Of course , since the AEC is open to the “ public ” many demanded to go inside , but were n’t allowed .

Ann Wright at that point was speaking directly to the kids who had gathered to witness what we were doing and told them not to “ buy the recruiters stories ” of patriotic glory .
That there was “ nothing glorious ” about war , and it definitely was “ not a game . ”
Debra Sweet , National Director of World Ca n’t Wait , who co-sponsored and planned this event , took charge of the microphone and denounced the AEC and the government for allowing this place to exist , recruiting youth to participate in an illegal war , as well as enticing them with games when war is “ not a game . ”
Pat Elder of Peace Action , Montgomery , had packs of candy cigarettes which he labeled “ Warning : Allowing teens to shoot weapons at the mall is like a heavy dose of CANDY CIGARETTES ! ” and gave out to youth witnessing our protest .
After only one warning , the police decided to aggressively arrest seven of the protesters who were wearing death masks , peacefully standing in front of the AEC and not blocking the entrance .
Taken to a distant precinct , the civil affairs Captain vowed vengeance by trying to charge the seven with a “ misdemeanor in the third degree . ”
After 6 hours in the most deplorable conditions , they were released to return to court in June .
We Must All Take Action
What is happening right under our noses is a transformation of the way in which the military plans on re-wiring the brains of kids at a very young and impressionable age to turn them into silent killers .
By allowing anyone from the age of 13 to 18 to handle a machine gun , or use games that promote violence , it creates a generation that is wired to kill and think that killing is something that is easy and sanctioned .

I want to combine two things I 've previously discussed : Synthetic Differential Geometry ( SDG ) and Derivatives of Containers
SDG is all about working with values , d , such that d²=0 .
When this is true , we find that for suitable functions f ,
f( x+d ) =f( x ) +d f'( x ) ( Eq. 1 )
where f ' is the derivative of f .
Now consider derivatives of types .
I 've written a really sloppy description here but for a proper treatment there are papers like this one .
The curious idea is that if you ' differentiate ' the type of a container you find the type of the container with a hole in it .
Here 's a really quick example : let F [ X ] be the container that is a triples of X's .
In other words F [ X ] =X×X×X=XXX=X3 .
Here × is the usual product in the category of types .
By a container with a ' hole ' we mean a container with one of its elements missing , but with a ' hole ' left behind so we know where the element has gone missing from .
Consider the triple .
Either the first element is missing .
In this case there are two elements left , so we have something of type X2 .
On the other hand the middle element could be missing , and the remaining elements also give something of type X2 .
Or the last element could be missing .
Put these three cases together and we get X2+X2+X2=3X2 .
( The ' 3 ' in 3X ² indicates that we know which of the three elements has been replaced with a hole . )
If we use the prime symbol to mean differentiation we see that a triple with a hole in it is just dX3 / dX= F ' [ X ] .
This generalises to other types , you can read the papers for more details .
I think that 's the most amazing bit of computer science I 've seen in years .
And it 's even more fun with recursive types because you then get zippers .
Anyway , those are my ingredients and the following assumes that the above makes some kind of sense to you .
So the mad thought I had was this : if you can do calculus by introducing infinitesimals such that d2=0 , can we investigate containers with holes by introducing some kind of infinitesimal type with the bizarre property that
D2=0 ?
D is a type here , not a value .
I 'm hoping you can just play along here .
Clearly we 're talking about a weird kind of product when the product of a non-trivial object with itself is the zero object .
Presumably to make sense of this we 're not really talking about the usual categorical product , just as in the algebra[ d ] / ( d ) we 're not talking about the usual real number multiplication .
And note , of course , that I 'm not saying that D is the type of infinitesimal numbers - I 'm saying that the type itself is in some sense infinitesimal .
So what could D2=0 possibly mean ?
Well 0 is the type defined by the property that there are no values of type 0 .
So D2=0 simply means that you can't have a pair of objects of type D. So D is n't so weird at all , it corresponds to a type representing the singleton pattern .
( Do n't confuse this with the ' singleton ' type 1 .
There is only one object of type 1 but we can have as many of them as we like .
On the other hand , there may be many values an object of type D could take , but only one of those possible values can be realised . )
So now consider the type F [ X+D ] .
This is a container , each of whose elements are of type X or of type D. Consider the case that they 're all of type X .
Then we have something of type F [ X ] .
Now suppose that one of the elements is of type D.
Then what we have is an F - container of X's with a hole , with a D in the hole .
In other words , D×F ' [ X ] .
And now 's the fun bit - this is all of the possible cases because the container can only contain one D . After all only one D can exist .
Writing this out formally we get :
F[ X+D ] =F [ X ]+D F ' [ X ]
In other words , we have interpreted Equation 1 in the context of types .
As d can be thought of an infinitesimal value it makes sense to call D an infinitesimal type .
I 'm not sure how far you can run with this idea , but given that the argument above seems to make some kind of sense I expect a smarter person than me could give it rigorous form .
A final thought : D2=0 is n't really all that weird .
We 're already familiar with linear types and linear logic where we have things that can't be duplicated .
This is just a different language to say something similar .
Anyway , </ mad thought >
Lord Carter used to head up Ofcom
Communications minister Lord Carter , Gordon Brown 's ex-strategy chief , is to leave his post .
The government says the peer - who is heading up a review of plans to improve broadband access - was always planning to step down during the summer recess .
He will present his Digital Britain report to cabinet on Tuesday before setting out plans to implement its recommendations , it says .
Lord Carter is tipped to return to the private sector , The Times suggests .
He told the newspaper : " I 'm beavering away feverishly on my report , that 's my only preoccupation . "
Mr Carter was made Gordon Brown 's strategy chief in January 2008 .
He had headed up one of the city 's best known communication firms , Brunswick Group LLP , and used to be chief executive of media watchdog Ofcom .
The appointment followed a difficult few months for Mr Brown , following the run on Northern Rock , the loss of 25 m people 's child benefit records and negative press after the prime minister decided not to call an autumn election .
But nine months later he was moved to the department for business as a junior minister for communications , technology and broadcasting and elevated to the House of Lords .
In a statement , the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills said : " Lord Carter will present his report to Cabinet on Tuesday .
" We can confirm that he will step down at summer recess with the completion of his work , as originally intended and with the full agreement of the prime minister . "

Top 10 ugly plants
RHS experts have scoured the planet to produce a list of the world 's top 10 ugliest plants .
Their choice spans the spectrum from the spiky to the hairy .
An El Monte police officer was legally justified in kicking a car chase suspect in the head as he was lying on the ground at the end of a televised high - speed pursuit because it was a “ distraction blow , ” a police union attorney said Friday .
Dieter Dammier , attorney for the El Monte Police Officers Assn. , said the officer acted within his training and department policy when he delivered the kick .
“ Unfortunately these things never look good on video .
Sometimes officers have to use force when dealing with bad guys , ” Dammier said .
“ The officer initially came upon the suspect alone .
The suspect had n’t been searched and was a parolee and a gang member . ”
“ The individual officer saw some movement .
He feared the parolee might have a weapon or be about to get up .
So the officer did what is known as a distraction blow .
It was n’t designed to hurt the man , just distract him . ”

El Monte officers , he said , “ are trained to deliver a distraction blow to stop a [ suspect ] doing what they are planning on doing . ”
The decision by the officer to kick the head of a suspect who was surrendering has been criticized by use - of - force experts .
Samuel Walker , a criminology professor at the University of Nebraska , called the kick to the head “ unprovoked and unnecessary .
. . .
It ’s one of the worst incidents of this kind that I ’ve seen . ”
The incident began Wednesday afternoon when gang officers recognized a man they believed was a gang member driving a Toyota .
They were trying to determine if the car was stolen when the driver committed an unspecified traffic violation .

Richard Rodriguez sped off , blowing through stop signs and running red lights at speeds reaching 80 mph , department spokesman Lt. Ken Alva said .
Video shows Rodriguez being kicked in the face after he had put his hands up and fell to the ground with his arms above his head .
Two officers are seen in news footage giving each other high - fives .

Astronauts aboard the International Space Station noticed two mysterious dark circles in the ice of Russia 's Lake Baikal in April .
Though the cause is more likely aqueous than alien , some aspects of the odd blemishes defy explanation .
The two circles are the focal points for ice break - up and may be caused by upwelling of warmer water in the lake .
The dark color of the circles is due to thinning of the ice , which usually hangs around into June .
Upwelling would n't be strange in some relatively shallow areas of the lake where hydrothermal activity has been detected , such as where the circle near the center of the lake ( pictured below ) is located .
Circles have been seen in that area before in 1985 and 1994 , though they were n't nearly as pronounced .
But the location of the circle near the southern tip of the lake ( pictured above ) where water is relatively deep and cold is puzzling .
The lake itself is an oddity .
It is the largest by volume and the deepest ( 5370 feet at its deepest point ) , as well as one of the oldest at around 25 million years .
The photo above was taken by an astronaut from the ISS .
The photo below was taken by NASA 's MODIS satellite instrument .

Manchester United were outclassed in the Stadio Olimpico as Barcelona wrapped up the first ever La Liga , Copa Del Rey and Champions League treble
Good evening everybody , and a very warm welcome to one and all of you wherever you may be .
Here 's hoping for a wonderful game of football between Manchester United and Barcelona in Rome 's Stadio Olimpico tonight .
Before we get on with the fun , a brief safety announcement : the fire exits are there , here and off down there .
Pleasantries and formalities over , now we can get on with the ... oh , for the love and honour of sweet baby jesus , Sky anchorman Richard Keys is already saying that " on nights like these we 're all Englishmen " ... to an audience that boasts Dutchman Ruud Gullit and Scotland 's Graeme Souness and Planet Inanity 's Jamie Redknapp .
Obviously he 's implying that everyone in England wants Manchester United to win when he must know by now that nothing could be further from the truth .
My Kent Brockman -esque Two Cents : I do n't particularly mind who wins tonight so long as we get a decent ball - game , but it has become apparent to me in the build - up to this match that a lot of Manchester United fans , English journalists and other media pundits have been struck down with a mutant strain of the World Cup and European Championship fever that tends to strike in the build - up to major international tournaments .
Gripped by jingoistic fervour , they fly in the face of all available evidence to the contrary and confidently back England , only to see their horse stumble unimpressively through the group stages before being inhumanely destroyed by a vastly superior thoroughbred in the second round or quarter - finals .
While there can be no doubt in the mind of any sentient human being that Manchester United are considerably better than England , I think a lot of the cheerleaders who 've been predicting success for them tonight are basing their assessments of Barcelona on the only two matches they 've seen them play this season , in which they did n't perform as shabbily as some would have you believe despite the smothering tactics employed by Chelsea .
But anyone who watches Barcelona play week in and week out will know they 're capable of a lot better and , even though Sir Alex Ferguson will have a few tricks up his sleeve , I 'm going to predict a fairly comfortable win for Barca .
By all means crow if I get it horribly wrong , but bear in mind it 's only an opinion that 's no more valid than that of anyone else ... except you , obviously .
Yes you , sitting there in your office or bedroom , reading this on your PC monitor , possibly with several other screens open , each of them showing something that 's probably illegal in several American states .
A more precise prediction , you say ?
Oh , go on then : Manchester United 2 - 4 Barcelona .
Some ground - rules for some of our more excitable readers :
If you wish to send in an always welcome email , please bear in mind that I almost certainly wo n't get a chance to read more than a fraction of them during the game , unless it 's unspeakably tedious , in which case I may well switch over to BBC and start giving a minute - by - minute report on the latest antics of the chaffinch family on Springwatch .
Anyway , please desist from ( a ) firing off the same email over and over again , because the original is almost certainly already sitting in my inbox unopened ( or opened and unpublished because it 's a bit ... er , too good ) , ( b ) sending in emails that have absolutely no punctuation or capital letters where punctuation and capital letters are meant to be and ( c ) dispatching outraged accusations of bias just because I happen to describe a risible performance , misplaced pass or terrible shot by somebody playing for whatever team you support .
Much to my amusement , I recently had several impossibly outraged readers accusing me of bias because I happened to mention in a commentary that I had a bet on one of the teams participating .
The bloke who sent it was so deranged he actually seemed to think that I could affect the outcome by providing an imbalanced commentary .
If only ...
Barcelona , complete with Iniesta and Henry , but no Eric Abidal ( suspended ) , Danny Alves ( suspended ) or Rafael Marquez ( knacked ) : 1 - Victor Valdes ; 5 - Carles Puyol , 24 - Yaya Toure , 3 - Gerard Pique , 16 - Silvinho ; 28 - Sergio Busquets , 6 - Xavi , 8 - Andres Iniesta ; 10 - Lionel Messi , 9 - Samuel Eto'o , 14 - Thierry Henry .
Subs : Pinto , Caceres , Muniesa , Keita , Gudjohnsen , Bojan , Pedrito .
Manchester United , with added Park Ji-sung and Rio Ferdinand but no Carlos Tevez ( bench ) , Dimitar Berbatov ( bench ) , Darren Fletcher ( suspended ) or Howard Webb ( not selected by Uefa ) : 1 - Edwin van der Sar ; 22 - John O'Shea , 5 - Rio Ferdinand , 15 - Nemanja Vidic , 3 - Patrice Evra ; 13 - Park Ji-sung , 16 - Michael Carrick , 8 - Anderson , 11 - Ryan Giggs ; 7 - Cristiano Ronaldo , 10 - Wayne Rooney .
Subs : Kuszczak , Rafael Da Silva , Evans , Nani , Scholes , Berbatov , Tevez .
Referee : Massimo Busacca ( Switzerland * )
* Spare me the jokes about neutrality .
You 're better than that .
First email of the night : " Am standing in line outside the Stadio Olimpico , " writes Nick Lesser to minute - by - minute reporter sitting in a chair in a Kings Place office .
" Every gate has over 500 metres of queueing .
This could get problematic , to put it very mildly , if people do n't get in in time .
Visca EL Barça anyway ! "
Was that a threat or an observation ?
It read like a threat to me .
Carbineri , you have been warned - let Nick Lesser in or there 'll be hell to pay .
Here 's an observation of my own : I can't believe people still bother to actually go to football matches when there 's a service as good as the Guardian 's minute - by - minute report available .
They obviously mus n't have heard about it yet .
Spread the word , Nick Lesser .
Tell all those people there 's no need to stand in line if they head for the nearest internet cafe .
Another email , this time from Christopher Davis : " Is James Richardson the man whipping the crowd into a Frenzy in the ground tonight ? " he asks .
" If so I trust you 'll keep us updated on him and his gags / gaffs ! "
It gives me no pleasure to reveal that James did n't get that particular gig this year .
Apparently Bob Carolgees and Spit the Dog were available .
But I can reveal that AC Jimbo will be here tomorrow for our Champions League Football Weekly Extra special ( subscribe now on iTunes if you have n't done so already ) , and his usual post - Champions League newspaper round - up , which will be up on the site just as soon as he 's finished recording it on the bank of the land - fill that passes for a canal out the back of our offices .
Sir Alex speaks : " We 've got a strong bench ... could be a deciding factor for us ... great players ...
Scholes , Berbatov , Tevez can make a difference ...
Giggs starting in the middle to support Cristiano up front ... a hat - trick of Champions League titles would be nice , but we 'll talk about that once the game is over . "
Sky pundit Graeme Souness speaks : " Manchester United are set up to punish Barcelona at the back ... I think we 're in for a classic game of football ...
I think Chelsea put the fear of God in Barcelona and may have done Manchester United a huge favour .
Inside the Stadio Olimpico :
The centre - circle is covered by a large red Champions League flag .
In the middle of the pitch , which is surrounded by one of my pet hates - a running track ( I even hate them when they 're not surrounding football pitches ) - there 's some sort of pre-match opening ceremony involving a lot of heavily made - up dancers with black bob hairstyles , dressed in long , predominantly red dresses and holding shields gadding about in formation in each half , while a shiny lady dressed as a Roman deity is behaving in a god - like fashion and making off with the European Cup .
Apparently they 're showing the similarities between ancient Rome and modern day football .
Insert your own " greed " , " gluttony " , " orgy " and " betrayal " jokes here .
With Andrea Bocelli providing the soundtrack on the pitch , the players emerge from the tunnel and line up .
They exchange handshakes , discard their tracksuit tops and get ready for what I hope is going to be a marvellous game of football .
The skippers Ryan Giggs and Carles Puyol exchange pennants in the centre - circle then the ref tosses the coin .
Game on : Barcelona kick off , playing from right to left , work the ball back to their goalkeeper , Victor Valdes , who immediately concedes a throw - in deep inside his own half after being put under pressure by Ronaldo .
United 's players are dressed in virginal white tonight .
1 min : Brilliant block by Gerard Pique , who stops Park Ji-sung from side - footing home the rebound from a Cristiano Ronaldo free - kick from 30 yards out .
Victor Valdes could only parry .
3 min : It 's all United very early doors - Barcelona 's players are n't being given a moment to settle on the ball .
4 min : " Park !
Park !
Wherever you may be !
You eat dogs in your home country !
But it could be worse , you could be Scouse !
Eating rats in your council house ! " sing the United hordes .
For my money , the greatest football chant of all time as it manages to be simultaneously endearing and offensive on a number of levels .
5 min : Rio Ferdinand sends a raking cross - field ball towards Rooney , who traps it perfectly on the left wing .
He plays a weighted pass to the byline for Ryan Giggs to chase , but there 's a little too much weight on the ball and it rolls wide .
6 min : Cristiano Ronaldo tries his luck from distance , letting fly from about 40 yards .
His effort fizzes wide of Valdes ' left stick .
8 min : Another shot from Cristiano Ronaldo , who attempts to volley a dropping ball diagonally across the face of goal and into the bottom right hand corner .
Wide .
GOAL ! Barcelona 1 - 0 Man United ( Eto'o 9 ) Barcelona land a sucker - punch on United , scoring with their first attack .
With alarming ease , Iniesta drifts past Anderson and slips the ball to Eto'o in the right channel .
He cuts inside Vidic and toe - pokes the ball past Van der Sar into the botom left - hand corner despite a fruitless last - ditch lunge from Carrick .
10 min :
There 's no respite for United as Barcelona win a corner on the back of a lazy pass from Vidic .
It 's sent in from the left and drops nicely for Messi , who swings and misses .
United clear .
Where 's the defending ?
12 min : The Barcelona nerves that were evident in the opening 10 minutes have disappeared .
Their tails are up and Manchester United 's players are the ones who look a bit shell - shocked .
The goal came about as a result of very slack play from Anderson , while Vidic , who was left hoirribly exposed , will be very disappointed he let Eto'o get past him so easily .
13 min : Assorted Barcelona midfielders stroke the ball over and back across midifeld , slowly advancing on the United goal .
A misplaced pass by Messi allows United to break and Ronaldo goes on the chase after a through ball , where Pique blocks him cynically .
He does n't get booked , but he does concede a free - kick about 28 yards from goal , right of centre .
15 min : Giggs takes the free - kick , sendning it high and wide .
Everyone in the wall jumped - there was definitely a case for him to drill it low and hard towards the near post ... although he'd have looked a bit of a chump if he 'd pursued thatt particular course of action and those in the wall had n't jumped .
18 min : Barcelona attack down the right wing , where Samuel Eto'o pulls the ball back to Leo Messi , who pulls the trigger from distance and rifles the ball over the bar .
Edwin van der Sar is unhappy with Rio Ferdinand , who was slow about closing the Argentinian down .
20 min : Cristiano Ronaldo waves his hand by way of apology after toe - poking a shot from distance wide when a pass inside to his Wayne Rooney would have been the more sensible option .
21 min : Great diagonal ball from Michael Carrick in the centre - circle , who quarter - backs it towards wide receiver Wayne Rooney on the left flank .
He keeps it in play and wins a corner , from which Cristiano Ronaldo heads well over despite slack marking from Barcelona 's defenders .
23 min : A quarter of the match gone and it's been very entertaining so far .
Barcelona are in the lead , but Manchester United have had more clear - cut scoring chances .
Wayne Rooney has been noticably quiet thus far , which is kind of understandable because Cristiano Ronaldio seems determined to win the game single - handedly for Manchester United .
25 min : Barcelona win the ball from Manchester United and show no sign that they 're about to give it back any time soon .
After a patient build - up in the final third , Xavi tries to thread the ball through United 's centre - halves for Messi to run on to , but Rio Ferdinand cuts it out .
26 min : Barca win a free - kick about 30 yards out from goal on the left channel .
Xavi curls the ball wide , but not too wide , of Van der Sar 's right upright .
Even if his effort had been on target , the big Dutchman had it covered .
28 min : " In an email entitled ' Another George classic ' , correspondent Michael Friel reveals that " acording to the renowned RTE commentator George Hamilton , Barcelona 's play is not poetry in motion but ' geometry in motion ' ... it 's all about the angles you see . "
29 min : Half an hour gone and the time has flown by .
There 's been a few fouls , but nothing serious and no dirty play , diving or maggot - acting .
The only penalty shout so far has been a half - hearted one from Manchester United fans when Park Ji-sung was beaten to a through - ball by Victor Valdes , who hoofed it cleanly in to the stands .
32 min : Tip , tap , tip ... tap .. tip .. stroke ... tap ... tip ... languids flick ... ooh laa ... Manchester United throw - in off Thierry Henry .
34 min : Corner for Barcelona .
Nemanja Vidic cut out a low , hard cross from the right by Carles Puyol .
Thierry Henry was waiting in the centre if the big Serb had missed it .
35 min : From that corner , Barca win another one , from which Vidic just beats the onrushing Pique , getting something , possibly an arm , to the ball and sending it out for a throw - in , from which nothing comes .
36 min : Judging by the number of nerdish , Inspector Logic - type emails in my inbox begnning with : " Excuse me , I think you 'll find that in the 13th minute ... "
Gerard Pique may have been booked for that block on Ronaldo .
It seems the lenses in my spectacles may not have been thick enough for me to notice the flash of yellow .
40 min : Oh crumbs !
Busquets ( crumbs , Busquets ... geddit ? ) gives the ball away to Giggs , who sends Park skipping down the right flank , only to be dispossessed by Yaya Toure .
41 min : A promising Barca attack down the left flank comes to naught when Eto'o is beaten to a Lionel Messi pass by Park Ji-sung , who sets off on the counter .
Speaking of Park , could the handful of readers who 've written in to label me a racist for reproducing the lyrics of an affectionate song Manchester United fans composed about their industrious and much - loved South Korean please stop wringing your hands , moaning and get a life .
I 'm not a racist and I have nothing against Scousers .
44 min : Messi drills a low ball across the edge of the six - yard box which Van der Sar should gather comfortably but does n't .
He spills the ball from his grasp and Rio Ferdinand is forced to step in hack clear .
Half - time
A brief summary of Sky 's half - time analysis , except without the inane interruptions of Jamie Redknapp which are quite evidently a constant source of irritation for Graeme Souness : " Xavi and Iniesta being allowed run the show ... Vidic and Ferdinand frighten me they 're so poor ...
Giggs now playing as a second striker leaving Barcelona too much room in midfield ... Anderson doing nothing . "
It 's all fair comment , that .
Second half : Manchester United substitution : Anderson off , Carlos Tevez on .
Manchester United kick off .
Expect Ryan Giggs to play alongside Michael Carrick in the centre of midfield , with Wayne Rooney playing on the right , Park on the left and Tevez and Ronaldo up front .
46 min : During half - time , Souness said that he'd never seen the Manchester United defence look as scared as they do tonight .
He added that Vidic and Ferdinand should stop passing the ball back to their goalkeeper all the time , start making braver decisions and try play the ball out of defence .
I have to say that I 've been quite impressed with his punditry tonight .
He 's obviously learning well from his stints beside comedy double - act John Giles and Eamon Dunphy on RTE .
48 min : Henry goes close , so very close , for Barcelona , exploiting the massive John O'Shea - shaped hole that was left at the back when United were dispossessed and caught on the break .
Henry galloped up the left channel , cut inside Rio Ferdinand and then shot straight at Van der Sar when he had only the keeper to beat from about 10 yards out .
50 min : With Manchester United 's players being ( a ) knackered from chasing shadows all night and ( b ) having to go for it , Barcelona go close twice more while exploiting the gaping holes being torn in the United defence .
Eto'o goes close ...
Messi goes close ... then appeals for a penalty when he goes down under a John O'Shea challenge while trying to get on the end of an Eto'o through - ball .
Did he get a nudge ?
I do n't know .
In all the excitement , I should add that Xavi has also hit the post with a free - kick .
52 min : Barcelona win a free - kick , a couple of yards outside the penalty area , straight in front of goal .
Xavi curls it round the wall and Van der Sar puts it out for a corner with a strong left hand .
Manchester United are getting their arses handed to them on a plate here .
53 min : Carrick pings the ball towards Rooney on the right touchline and he sends a cross into the penalty area , where ... none of his team - mates are waiting to get on the end of it .
55 min : Rooney sends in another cross from the right .
It eludes Ronaldo , who flung himself at it , then Park was beaten by the bounce .
A throw - in for Barca which could n't be deeper inside their own half .
57 min : Stroke … pass … triangle … slide - rule pass … back - heel … tip … tap … slide - rule pass … neat triangle … neat triangle … neat tirangle … through - ball … languid stroke … flick … trap … deft touch … chest … clatter … hoof ... yaroo!
Free - kick for Barcelona .
59 min : Cristiano Ronaldo gets caught this much offside while trying to chase a low through - ball down the left flank from Michael Carrick .
60 min : Carrick dinks a ball to the byline for Rooney to chase .
Once again , there 's too much weight on it and Barca get the goal - kick .
The difference between United / Carrick and Barcelona / Iniesta is that the wee Catalan just does n't make mistakes like that .
62 min : Barcelona concede a corner , which is sent in from the right .
The delivery is poor and the ball goes out for a Barcelona throw - in .
On the touchline , Dimitar Berbatov is stripping off his tracksuit and receiving instruction from Sir Alex Ferguson .
I foresee more goals in this match .
I could n't tell you who'll score them , but I 'm pretty confident they 're coming .
64 min : Barcelona go forward , working the ball out to Henry on the left .
He cuts inside and shoots weakly at Valdes .
65 min : Manchester United substitution : Park off , Berbatov on .
Manchester United score an average of one goal every 13 minutes whenever Ronaldo , Berbatov , Tevez and Rooney are on the pitch together .
Bear in mind they 've only been on the pitch together for about 110 minutes all season .
67 min : " Evening , good game this , " writes Alex Warwick .
" But you have to say that Tim Lovejoy had a point when he said Barca only have one way of playing .
I mean , c'mon , look at this pass ... pass ... move ... move stuff .
Useless !
The first touch of these Barce players is just so good , but you know that Man U will bag one later on , just to give the idiot Tyldesley something to bang on about . "
GOAL ! Barcelona 2 - 0 Manchester United ( Messi 70 ) Messi breaks his scoring duck against an English team as John O'Shea stands staring at him with slack - jawed astonishment .
After being gifted possession by Evra , the advancing and unimpeded Xavi only has one target to aim at when he sends an inch - perfect cross towards the far post where , unmarked , the diminutive Argentinian leaps on the edge of the six - yard box , contorts in the air , arches his neck backwards and steers a cushioned header across Van der Sar and into the far corner .
That is a marvellous goal , but the defending was abysmal .
72 min : Berbatov and Giggs blow excellent opportunities to pull one back for United , with the former volleying wide from the edge of the six yard box after Giggs had won a corner at the end of a goalmouth scramble that should have resulted in a United goal .
73 min : Free - kick for Barcelona on the right flank , between penalty area and touchline .
Xavi sends the ball across the edge of the six - yard box , where Puyol is first to it and plants a meaty header straight at Van der Sar .
If he 'd aimed anywhere else it would have been a goal .
76 min : Barcelona are playing keep - ball , Manchester United 's players are still chasing shadows .
Some substitution news : Scholes has replaced Giggs on the field and as captain .
Henry 's gone off for Barcelona but I 'm not sure who replaced him .
78 min :
An increasingly petulant Cristiano Ronaldo gets booked for a foul on Carles Puyol .
Moments later , Scholes joins him in the book for one of his trade - mark lunges on Busquets .
He could have had no complaints if he'd been sent off for that .
80 min : Between those bookings , Iniesta wasted an opportunity by picking up the ball on the left , cutting inside and shooting straight at Van der Sar .
81 win : Nine minutes to go and Manchester United need a goal .
They finally win possession and manage to hold on to it for a while , which is not something that 's happened too often in this half .
Their attack breaks down when Evra has to stretch for a pass and clatters into Messi .
82 min : Barcelona go forward again with Iniesta on the ball .
He 's been the man of the match tonight , without question .
His passing is just so unerringly accurate .
84 min : Brilliant play from Barcelona , whose patient passing culminates with them ripping United 's defence asunder , leaving a gaping space for Carles Puyol to run into .
His attempt to chip the onrushing Van der Sar fails .
Good save .
87 min : Berbatov 's been leaden - footed of touch , inaccurate of shot and generally worse than useless since coming on - it 's time Ferguson cut his losses , admitted buying the Bulgarian was a mistake and got rid of him .
Pique , who was more than happy to get rid of last year , covers brilliantly for Yaya Tour , who 'd made a mess of a clearance leaving Carlos Tevez clean through on goal .
90 min :
There 'll be three minutes of injury time .
How many of them will Barcelona use up taking this corner ?
90+1 min : Manchester United are 2 - 0 down in injury - time in a Champions League final and their opponents are taking the piss out of them , stroking the ball around the edges of their ( the United ) penalty area .
Their humiliation is complete .
90+2 min : Barcelona substitution : their conductor , Iniesta , makes way for Pedrito .
Peep !
Peep !
Peep !
The excellent referee ( credit where it 's due , we give them plenty of grief when they make mistakes ) Massimo Busacca ends the game and the engraver gets his chisel out to inscribe the big cup : Barcelona , Spain 's league and cup double winners , are the new champions of Europe .
Post - match niceties :
The celebrations of the Barcelona players are fairly muted , possibly because victory came so easy to them .
They bossed Manchester United from the 10th minute on , pressurising them into repeatedly giving the ball away , while Xavi and Iniesta were allowed to do as they pleased in midfield throughout .
Just as Barcelona 's players are n't celebrating too raucously or wildly , Manchester United 's do n't look too gutted , probably because they know they were lucky to escape an even more embarrassing hiding .
9.45 pm : Sir Alex Ferguson is standing on the pitch looking very dazed and confused .
He 's been let down by plenty of his big - name players tonight : O'Shea , Vidic , Ferdinand , Evra , Carrick , Anderson , Rooney , Giggs , Berbatov , Scholes ... were all very , very poor .
United collect their runners - up medals : Followed by Ryan Giggs and the troops , Sir Alex Ferguson leads his side up the steps to where a party of dignitaries including Prince William , Michel Platini and Silvio Berlusconi - more of an indignitary - shake their hands .
Barcelona 's players go up the red and gold steps surrounding what looks a bit like the bridge of an alien spaceship on Star Trek or Flash Gordon , receive their medals and wait for Carles Puyol to arse his way through the throng ( " we 're gonna need a bigger stage " ) and receive the trophy from Michel Platini .
He hoists it into the Rome sky , the ticker - tape cannons explode and Barcelona 's players set off on their lap of honour .
Sir Alex speaks : " A bad start for us ... they can keep the ball all night ... we got some half - chances ... we were n't at our best ... to be fair we were beaten by a better team ... the heat did n't bother us , it was a nice night ... cough , splutter ... they defended very well ... we thought we'd be able to get at their back four but we could n't ... we 're still a young team and we can improve from this . "
A lot of journalists in England left looking very stupid tonight ... and I 'm not one of them .
Yahoo !
I honestly could n't believe how many tabloid johnnies and supposed broadsheet behemoths were breezily predicting a win for Manchester United this morning .
On what grounds were they basing this nonsense ?
A text from my good friend and colleague Scott Murray " Liverpool always win in Rome , " he says , archly .
This from Michael Hatcher : " So , those Manchester United finals in full : Benfica 68 - awfully well done ; Bayern 99 - played off park for 91 mins , then do a Bolton ; Chelsea '08 - win a scrappy affair on pens - just ; Barca '09 - played off park by a team with a makeshift defence .
Not all that really , is it ? "
If you backed Thierry Henry to be the first player to put the trophy on his head , go and collect .
Interestingly , Gerard Pique has procured a big pair of scissors from somewhere and is busy cutting up the goal nets .
It 's not random vandalism , as he 's being very methodical and meticulous about it , carefully measuring out squares before snipping .
Perhaps he has a basketball hoop in his back garden that needs replacing ?
This from Andrew Cummings , who is watching in Spain .
" On TV , they 've just mentioned ( in between the adverts ) that seven of the Barcelona starting 11 came through the youth team .
Chelsea might like to have a think about that ! "
If your name 's Patrice Evra , look away now .
" Men against boys , as a certain Man Utd defender may have said recently , " writes David Junggren .
Corrections and clarifications : " May I point out that Iniesta is not a wee Catalan ( 60 min ) but from Albacete , which is in Castilla La Mancha ( yes , like Don Quijote ) , " writes Alberto Tobias .
" He is pretty wee though . "
" Their heads are on swivels ! " exclaims Jamie Redknapp in Sky central , marvelling at Xavi and Iniesta 's ability to see what 's going on around them .
" Their heads are on swivels ! " he repeats .
Yes Jamie , their heads are on swivels ... and so is yours .
It 's called your neck .
Right - oh , that 's me done for the night , the tournament and indeed the season .
There 'll be somebody here for minute - by - minute coverage of the FA Cup final on Saturday afternoon and we 'll be recording a Champions League final Football Weekly ...

Ladies and gentlemen of the Hot Air community , I have discovered an unfair disparity in access to a vital resource based on the economic condition of the consumer .
This disparity is not just egregious , but it threatens the very core of our American way of life .
People routinely get denied adequate and competent service on the basis of their ability to pay , even though they have a right to it , while the rich eat up all the resources with their ability to access the best and brightest in the field .
And in the interest of fairness , the federal government needs to find a solution and impose it on the industry as a whole .
I refer , of course , to legal representation .
Oh , sure , in an emergency , the government will foot the bill for a public defender to represent the poor and indigent , but that ’s hardly a comfort to those who needed a lawyer before getting into the emergency condition in the first place .
Besides , while we have many dedicated public defenders , it ’s hardly a news flash that the wealthy can afford much better representation and have a much better chance of prevailing in court in criminal cases .
When the poor , working class , and middle class end up in that emergency situation , they can lose their homes and property to pay for decent legal care — and that should n’t happen in America , should it ?
After all , unlike health care , Americans actually do have a Constitutional right to legal representation in court .
Some will scoff and say the lack of a lawyer , or a bad lawyer , ca n’t cause your death .
Those critics may want to talk with the inmates who got freed from Death Row and lifetime prison sentences after having mediocre attorneys lose cases when the defendant was really innocent .
Bad or nonexistent legal representation can take years off of your life , and can definitely get you killed .
Even beyond that , though , the wealthy and connected have access to a much wider range of legal services than even the middle class can afford .
Estate planning , trust funds , tax shelters — all of these can be expertly provided to those with the resources to afford them , while other Americans get second - class status in our legal system .
For those who aspire to egalitarianism of result , this arrangement should be such an affront that it demands real action — now .
I propose that the government impose a single - payer system on the legal profession .
Instead of charging private fees , all attorneys would have to send their bills to LegalCare , a new agency in the federal government .
Because the government can bargain collectively , they can impose rational fees for legal services instead of the exorbitant billing fees attorneys now charge .
Three hundred dollars an hour ?
Thing of the past .
Everyone knows that the government can control costs through price - setting ; now we can see this process applied to the legal system , where the government has a large interest in seeing cost savings .
How will we pay for LegalCare ?
I take a page from the House surtax method here , which will disproportionately hit doctors in a wide variety of disciplines .
In this case , I propose a 5.4 % surtax on lawyers , judges , lobbyists , and political officeholders at the state and federal level .
They ’re the ones who have enriched themselves through this inequity in the legal system .
After all , why should we all have to pay for the single - payer legal system when we can penalize lawyers instead ?
Now , this will have some impact on the legal - services market .
On the downside , we ’ll have fewer attorneys .
Law schools will get a lot less competitive as students avoid the law and the limited amount of money available through LegalCare , and existing attorneys may leave the profession as well as they fail to make enough money from the price - controlled compensation they get from the government .
All this will mean longer wait times and rationing of services as people flood attorneys ’ offices to demand services disconnected from the actual cost to provide them .
It may take a couple of years to get a will done , so start when you ’re young .
On the plus side … we ’ll have fewer attorneys .
And politicians !
Best of all , everyone will get the same level of legal care regardless of their ability to pay , thanks to LegalCare and the government - imposed rationing of a resource to which we have a right to access at any time we want , for any reason we want .
Addendum :
In case anyone misses the point , this is a satire .
However , I would n’t put it past certain statists to consider this a pretty good idea …
I can get a slurpee in Hong Kong and Buenos Aires , but not in Atlanta ?
Ok , that is n't really true , there is 1 store according to g-maps ... 45 min away from my location .
Some things are just ** wrong **.
As you may well know , PlayStation LifeStyle leaked the first trailer of [ shal ] Project Trico [ / shal ] , now officially known as [ shal ]
The Last Guardian [ / shal ] , a few weeks before E3 .
The third game from the creator of Ico and [ shal ] Shadow of the Colossus [ / shal ] , The Last Guardian had been developed under a shroud of secrecy for many years , and no one was more surprised about the leak than [ shal ] Shuhei Yoshida [ / shal ] , president of Sony WorldWide Studios .
This is what he had to say :
“ I ’d be lying if I said I was n’t disappointed .
Maybe there ’s a reason the person who leaked it waited until just before E3 .
But the reason we did n’t show early footage was because the team wanted to feel comfortable that the vision they created could be delivered .
So everything we showed here was from the game engine , and they ’ve got to the point where they know they can make this game and can see how it ’ll be completed . ”
The newest trailer for The Last Guardian can be viewed below .

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says he hopes the Continental Hockey League will expand to include clubs in central and western Europe .
The Interfax news agency reported that Putin said the KHL , which comprises teams from Russia , Belarus , Latvia and Kazakhstan , should expand beyond the former Soviet Union and " become a pan-European league . "
Putin says if that does happen , it would be " without any administrative domination " by Russia , meaning that Moscow would not seek to control the league .
Speaking to the Russian sports newspaper Sovietsky Sport , Putin said clubs from nations such as Sweden , the Czech Republic , Slovakia and Switzerland could join , according to Interfax .

If most people had a whole day named in their honor , they would probably sit back , relax in some air - conditioning , and sip on an Arnold Palmer .
Not Caron Butler .
If you 're looking for an exemplary member of the community who practices the recently popular issue of change , then look no further than the man they call Tuff Juice .
Two years ago , June 8 was declared " Caron Butler Day " by Racine , Wisc. , Mayor Gary Becker .
At the time , the Wizards all - star returned home to host a basketball camp and 10 days of charity events .
Unfortunately , the Racine mayor was since arrested on child porn and internet sexual solicitation of a minor charges .
C'mon Becker ... arrested for allegedly trying to meet a 14 - year old in the Mall ?
Really ?
But that has n't stopped Butler from putting in work , with new Mayor John Dickert keeping the tradition .
To perhaps best what he 's done in the past , calling even more attention to community service , today Caron has a packed an 11 - hour schedule throughout Root City , as highlighted by the Racine Journal Times .
From sponsoring a youth essay contest with the United Way , to celebrating last year 's Juneteenth Day in Racine , to working out in the very early hours of the morning to be around his daughter more , to recently attending the Uncommon Height awards , sponsored by Dr. Dorothy Height and the National Council of Negro Women ( NCNW ) , Butler sets a standard of enacting change through service that should make us all look in the mirror and ask ourselves what we are doing to make the world around us better .
Butler 's accomplishments as a player are great , but adding those to his work as a person makes him as close to untouchable as they come in the trade department .
Hopefully one day , Butler 's championship campaign will bring success to his Wizards party .
And perhaps on one June 8 in the future , the people of Racine will be watching Tuff Juice serve it up in the NBA Finals .

Most often when people think of the web they think of it as a place to get new information .
Companies are told they must constantly update their website while customers and citizens look for the latest updates .
But because the web is relatively new , it is strongly biased towards digitally displaying and archiving “ new ” information .
What happens when the web gets older ?
One possibility … it could change how we study history .
Again , nothing is different per se – the same old research methods will be used – but what if it is 10 times easier to do , a 100 times faster and contains with a million time the quantity of information ?
With the archives of newspapers , blogs and other websites readily available to be searched the types of research once reserved for only the most diligent and patient might be more broadly accessible .
Consider this piece in the New York Times published on November 5th 1999 .
It essentially defines ground zero of the financial crisis :
Congress approved landmark legislation today that opens the door for a new era on Wall Street in which commercial banks , securities houses and insurers will find it easier and cheaper to enter one anothers businesses .
The measure , considered by many the most important banking legislation in 66 years , was approved in the Senate by a vote of 90 to 8 and in the House tonight by 362 to 57 .
The bill will now be sent to the president , who is expected to sign it , aides said .
It would become one of the most significant achievements this year by the White House and the Republicans leading the 106th Congress .
” Today Congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the Great Depression and replace them with a system for the 21st century , ” Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said .
” This historic legislation will better enable American companies to compete in the new economy . ”
Here is what may be the defining starting point of the financial crisis .
The moment when the tiny little snowball was gently pushed down the hill .
It would take 10 years to gather the mass and momentum to destroy our economy , but it had a starting point .
I sometimes wish that the New York Times had run this article again in the last few months , just so we could get reacquainted with the individuals – like Larry Summers – and political parties – both – that got Americans into this mess .
Indeed , as an aside , it ’s worth noting the degree by which the legislation passed .
90 votes to 8 in the senate .
362 votes to 57 in the House .
There was clearly a political price to pay to vote against this bill .
Indeed , it fits in nicely with the thesis Simon Johnson outlined in his dark , but important , piece The Quiet Coup :
“ … these various policies — lightweight regulation , cheap money , the unwritten Chinese - American economic alliance , the promotion of homeownership — had something in common .
Even though some are traditionally associated with Democrats and some with Republicans , they all benefited the financial sector ”
Still more fascinating is how accurately the legislation ’s detractors predicted it ’s dire consequences .
Check out Senator Dorgan ’s comments at the time :
” I think we will look back in 10 years ’ time and say we should not have done this but we did because we forgot the lessons of the past , and that that which is true in the 1930 ’s is true in 2010 , ” said Senator Byron L. Dorgan , Democrat of North Dakota .
” I was n’t around during the 1930 ’s or the debate over Glass - Steagall .
But I was here in the early 1980 ’s when it was decided to allow the expansion of savings and loans .
We have now decided in the name of modernization to forget the lessons of the past , of safety and of soundness . ”
Or Senator Wellstone’s :
‘ Scores of banks failed in the Great Depression as a result of unsound banking practices , and their failure only deepened the crisis , ” Mr. Wellstone said .
” Glass - Steagall was intended to protect our financial system by insulating commercial banking from other forms of risk .
It was one of several stabilizers designed to keep a similar tragedy from recurring .
Now Congress is about to repeal that economic stabilizer without putting any comparable safeguard in its place . ”
And of course , it worth remembering what the legislation ’s supporters said in response :
Supporters of the legislation rejected those arguments .
They responded that historians and economists have concluded that the Glass - Steagall Act was not the correct response to the banking crisis because it was the failure of the Federal Reserve in carrying out monetary policy , not speculation in the stock market , that caused the collapse of 11,000 banks .
If anything , the supporters said , the new law will give financial companies the ability to diversify and therefore reduce their risks .
The new law , they said , will also give regulators new tools to supervise shaky institutions .
” The concerns that we will have a meltdown like 1929 are dramatically overblown , ” said Senator Bob Kerrey , Democrat of Nebraska . ”
What is most fascinating about this piece is that it shows us how the financial crisis was n’t impossible to predict , that it did n’t come out of nowhere and that it could have been eminently preventable .
We simply chose not to .
It also goes back to the type of journalism that I believe we are missing today and that I wrote about in my post on the Death of Journalism .
Here is a slow moving crisis , one that is highly complex , but not impossible to see .
And yet we chose not to “ see it . ”
This , I believe , has to do with the fact that today , much of our journalism is gotcha journalism ( or what Gladwell refers to as mysteries ) .
It looks to finding the insider or the smoking gun that will bust open the story .
I suspect that in a networked world – one of increased complexity and interconnectedness – finding the smoking gun is irrelevant .
For an increasing number of stories there simple is no smoking gun .
There are whole series of cascading action that are what Galdwell calls open secrets .
Our job is to “ see them ” and painstakingly connect the dots to show how our decisions are allowing for the scary and unpredictable event – the black swan event – to become a near certainty .
What the above article shows me is that while the very tools and forces that make these scary events more likely – the internet , globalization our interconnectedness – they may also make the the open secrets easier to identify .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A California company accusing a Chinese rival of stealing its code for anti-pornography software has demanded that U.S. PC makers Dell , Hewlett - Packard and Gateway stop shipping computers loaded with the program “ Green Dam ” .
Solid Oak Software Inc , which said it found pieces of its CyberSitter Internet - filtering software in a similar Chinese program , said it had faxed cease - and - desist letters to Dell , HP and Gateway , and to the U.S. units of Sony , Toshiba , Acer , and Lenovo .
Solid Oak executives have warned that they may seek a court injunction to try to stop PC manufacturers from shipping to China machines loaded with “ Green Dam ” , developed by Jinhui Computer System Engineering Inc and now mandatory on PCs sold in China , the world ’s third - largest economy .
“ With the cease - and - desist letters , we ’ve asked them to not ship the units as well as make accounting for any units that had been shipped , ” Solid Oak spokeswoman Jenna DiPasquale said .
She said that Solid Oak had not heard from the PC makers .
“ We ’re really hoping to have an amicable ” resolution , ” DiPasquale said .
“ This is n’t their fault , it ’s just something they ’ve been asked to do . ”
The Chinese government has required that all new computers made or shipped by July 1 come with “ Green Dam ” pre-installed , to protect children against pornography .
“ Green Dam ” filters out words , images and Web addresses .
Jinhui has denied stealing anything , but Solid Oak has contended that some of the stolen content included a list of terms to be blocked and instructions for updating the software .
Dell spokesman David Frink said “ along with the rest of the industry and relevant trade associations , we ’re still reviewing the ‘ Green Dam ’ policy initiative and working with government officials and others to understand its application . ”
HP did not respond to a request for comment .
Experts say piracy is on the rise as the global recession deepens .
U.S. corporations have long complained about piracy and lax enforcement of intellectual property rights in China .
The U.S. Trade Representative in April put China and Russia at the top of a list of countries with the worst record on preventing piracy and counterfeiting of U.S. goods .
China also made the top of the USTR ’s priority watch list for the fifth straight year .
Critics have said that China ’s “ Green Dam ” initiative raises issues of cybersecurity and Internet freedom .
Analysts said the action also raised concerns among U.S. PC makers , which fear they could face criticism in the West if they comply with the order , or lose market share in China if they do not .
China ’s PC market is forecast to be the world ’s largest by 2011 , with nearly 50 million units shipped annually by 2012 .
DiPasquale said Solid Oak might be open to some sort of licensing agreement with PC producers , but that would need to be discussed .
She said her company had engaged “ independent researchers ” to monitor and examine the Chinese software , but had not yet tried to contact Jinhui directly .
“ We ’re taking this a step at a time , ” she said .

In a move that can only be called unbelievable Republican Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina took to the Senate floor yesterday to defend RJ Reynolds for marketing a new mint flavored candy like tobacco product that seems designed to get kids hooked on nicotine , which is being tested in Ohio , Oregon , and Indiana .
CNN reported on May 27 that the product that RJ Reynolds is testing comes in three forms , sticks that dissolve as you suck them , breath strips , and orbs that look and are packaged like candy .
Critics claim that this the latest trick by tobacco companies to get kids hooked on nicotine , and according to the Indiana Poison Control Center one Camel dissolvable equals 300 % of the nicotine in a cigarette .
However , Sen. Richard Burr ( R - NC ) came to the tobacco company ’s defense yesterday , by defending the product as not candy .
Yep , his whole defense is that the product is n’t candy .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :

Burr said , “ But when CNN did their story .
Take a guess on the angle that they took .
They labeled it as candy .
Candy !
Even though it ’s not candy flavored .
They said it was candy .
…
No , they said it was candy .
That ’s where they labeled it .
…
They portrayed Reynolds America as being deceptive and luring children .
No candy .
It ’s not going in the candy section .
It ’s in the tobacco section where smokeless and stick products is . ”
Even though the products are sold in bright colored packaged , some of which are shaped like cell phones , Burr contends that this product is n’t aimed at kids .
Of course , his argument is ridiculous because it is illegal for tobacco products to be sold in the candy aisle .
The problem here is that this form of tobacco product is unregulated right now , this how the products can contain 300 % more nicotine than is found in one cigarette .
It would be more convenient for people me who do n’t smoke if nicotine junkies got their fix in a smokeless manner .
In all honesty , the tobacco industry depends on getting new and younger people addicted .
This is a way to get new consumers hooked on their product without the messiness of smoking .
However as Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D - OH ) said , “ For years , tobacco companies have deceived consumers and marketed products to children — continually trying to replace the 400,000 customers they lose each year to tobacco - related deaths and illnesses .
There is no doubt that smokeless tobacco products are aimed squarely at children .
We have a responsibility to protect children from suggestive marketing and dangerous products . ”
It is clear that this is another attempt to market their product to kids .
Once the product is regulated , I say let it stay on the market .
The hypocrisy within the government ’s anti-smoking crusade has always been that they try to get people to quit , while it the same they are depending on the tax revenue that smokers generate .
I am a live and let live kind of guy , if people want to smoke , it is their business , but these companies ca n’t be allowed to market their products to children .
According to the WHO , 41 % of Europeans do not engage in any kind of physical activity , but they are not the only ones : the entire western population and not only is involved in a ...
I think we ’ve covered the bases for general preparations , so now it ’s time to start making that print !
This is really the first step in producing a fine art print , but it ’s not any more or less important than the other steps .
If I could give just one piece of advice in this article , it would be to make the final print at the highest quality humanly possible .
Before we jump in , I should make my own printing situation very clear so there are no misconceptions .
I use a local professional printer to produce my digital prints : Oscar Medina of San Diego Pictures .
He ’s the real brains behind the whole printing thing , and he provides me with a top notch service .
I do n’t handle any of the technical aspects of printing — I just bring him the files and give him the thumbs - up to press the go -button .
So any technical information I provide here may be somewhat or completely wrong .
As for darkroom prints …
I do those myself , so I can speak to it with more confidence .
And again , we ’re just skimming the surface of this topic in this article — please ask specific questions and discuss technical stuff in the comments below .
The following tips mostly apply to digital printing rather than traditional darkroom printing .
PREPPING YOUR DIGITAL PHOTOS
Fine art photos are all about “ high quality ” — and that starts before you even see the image .
Make sure that you ’re shooting at the highest quality available with your equipment .
Shoot RAW , AdobeRGB , no downsizing , no compression , etc .
Use high quality glass if you can , and avoid camera shake by shooting at a fast enough shutter speed , etc , etc .
When you process the image , workflow is important .
Use 16 - bit color depth and a high quality color space ( I use AdobeRGB for color and Gray Gamma 2.2 for b/w ) .
Watch your histograms while processing , and do n’t let your colors , blacks , or whites jump off the scale — you ’ll be throwing away good information .
Obviously , make the photo look how you want , but do n’t go crazy on the adjustments if you ’re trying for a “ natural ” photo .
Calibrate your monitor so that you see a true representation of your image as you process it .
Whether you print yourself or if you have somebody else do it for you , the printer will assume that your photo was processed with a properly calibrated monitor .
When I take my digital files to Oscar , they look perfect on his monitor and they look perfect when they come out of the printer .
We both use a color managed workflow [ pdf 4.5 MB ] .
My typical image prep involves processing RAW files via Adobe Camera Raw ( same thing as Lightroom ) , and occasionally some Photoshop work if needed .
I ’ll work with the colors , highlights , shadows , and midtone contrasts to get the image looking the way I want .
I also put on a very small amount of sharpening and noise correction — just enough to make any artifacts go away .
In the last article , Andrew Ferguson asked “ I do n’t know what needs to be done to prepare them for print , workflow wise .
I ’m reasonably sure I need to convert to CMYK , but I do n’t know how else to optimize my files ( both b&w and colour ) to ensure that what I see on the monitor is what I see on the final print . ”
Maybe we can touch on this more in the comments , but I always shoot , process , and print using AdobeRGB for color images ( I process and print black and white images with gray gamma 2.2 ) .
From what I understand , printers will do their own conversion from RGB to CMYK or grayscale .
The important thing is to have a calibrated monitor and a calibrated printer —
I know Oscar spends a good deal of time keeping up with this stuff to ensure that what we see on his screen is what we see coming out of the printer .
I could probably go on and on about this stuff in more detail , but we need to talk about other things !
Chat - it - up in the comments .
PRINTER , PAPER , AND INK
After your digital file is prepped , you ’ll need to decide on a printer .
There are so many different types of printers and inks out there , I ’m not even going to try speaking to the technical side of this .
Just do your homework and find a system or method that suits your artistic needs .
Chances are , you ’ll either have your own printer or you ’ll need to find a printing service ( including PODs ) or a local professional with the right equipment .
With the current technology , any professional printer should be using top - notch equipment capable of producing archival prints ready for any gallery wall .
Paper , on the other hand , is more of the artist ’s decision than the printer or the ink .
There are a lot of different papers out there , and each of them has a unique visual quality suited for different applications .
You ’ll need to decide between gloss , semi-gloss , matte , metallic , canvas , watercolor , and other fine art papers with varying textures and colors .
Even with all the choices available , keep the quality and archival life in mind — fine art prints are supposed to last a long time .
Oscar actually has a book of the same image printed on various papers so you can see the different effects and outcomes .
This is super - handy when deciding on papers !
I usually go for the glossy paper because I like my prints shiny , but it ’s an easy paper to damage and scratch .
I ’m considering trying out a few canvas prints at the suggestion of Oscar … I just need to find the right photos for it .
SIZING , SHARPENING , AND NOISE REDUCTION
Print size is a big decision — do n’t underestimate it !
If you want to go really big , you ’ll need the pixels to back it up .
As a rule of thumb , I try to keep my stuff above 100 pixels per inch .
So a 12 MP digital photo can be printed up to about 20 ″ x 30 ″ without a huge loss of quality .
Once you get at or below 150 pixels per inch , you ’ll want to consider upsizing the image on the computer so you can get a better quality on the printer .
So for that same 12 MP photo , once I go above 20 ″ wide on the long dimension I ’ll probably resize the image to larger dimensions to avoid printing artifacts .
This can be done with Photoshop ( or other post processing software ) , but something like Genuine Fractals will do a better job for you .
If you need to up - res your photo in order to print at the size you require , it ’s best to do your sharpening and noise reduction at the very end .
If you ’re printing from the original ( not resized ) photo , just make sure to apply these things at the very end of your processing .
And do n’t go overboard … make sure you view your digital file at 100 % before finalizing the sharpening settings .
Over - sharpening will definitely show up on the print .
[ UPDATE ]
Gary Crabbe left a good comment below : it might be a bit clearer if it read , “ You should * Always * do your output sharpening * After * the image has been ( re -) sized to the final output measurements . ”
I think it might also be good to squeeze in a comment warning of over sharpening , and checking for sharpening artifacts at both “ Print Size ” and at “ Actual Pixels ” .
Agreed !
Thanks Gary !
One last thing on print size — know what size you want to print and WHY you want to print at that size .
Take into account things like viewing distance , intended border , where you ’ll be signing the print ( if at all ) , how it will be matted and framed , and how you ’re planning on transporting the print to the final owner .
Most of these things will make more sense to some of you as we proceed through this series — so stay tuned for the next couple of articles .
PRINTING , HANDLING , AND SHIPPING
When you finally get to the point of printing , most of your prep - work should be done .
If you ’ve done you job right , you should n’t have any problems .
But no matter how much preparation you ’ve done , it ’s always a good idea to print a test strip in order to evaluate the quality .
Choose a section of your photo that contains critical information such as deep shadows , bright highlights , important colors , or people ’s faces .
Print that section and make sure everything looks right .
If it does , go for it .
If it does n’t , go fix stuff .
You ’ll save a lot of time and material cost if you work with test strips before making the final print .
After the final print comes rolling off the printer , make sure you handle it like a newborn baby .
There ’s nothing worse than putting all that effort into a print only to bend it , crease it , or put a fingerprint on an otherwise perfect print .
Use lint - free gloves to handle the print .
Lay it out on acid - free paper .
And do n’t force it into any position that it wo n’t go naturally .
Larger prints can be rolled without damaging them — they can be flattened later .
For anything larger than 11 × 14 , I lay them face - down on acid - free paper and roll them into a 2 ″ - 3 ″ tube .
Before rolling these prints , be sure that they ’ve had time to properly dry so the ink does n’t smudge .
Other than that , use common sense !
When it comes to shipping , be careful how you package things .
If the print is fairly small , you can use photo mailers available for 8×10 or 11 × 14 prints .
Anything larger and you ’ll probably want to send it in a tube .
Even with tubes , some extra precaution should be taken .
I actually had a print damaged recently because the Post Office just does n’t care that you ’re sending sensitive material .
After talking with Oscar , he mentioned that he likes to roll his prints about 1 ″ smaller than the diameter of the shipping tube and float it in the center by placing extra packing paper at the ends .
So even if the tube gets crushed or bent ( which mine did just recently — sorry Mom ) , the print will likely survive due to that extra buffer of airspace .
FOR THE ANALOG FREAKS
Probably not the most popular topic , but I know at least one or two of you are interested in my darkroom workflow .
First of all , I use high quality enlarger lenses and easels .
Enlargers are no different than cameras , only opposite — so use good stuff .
Also , for signed prints , I use fiber base paper and I tone with selenium for archival longevity .
Proper fix and wash are also key in the quality of the print .
I do n’t have actual data points to back up my suspicions , but I ’d expect my darkroom prints to last at least 100 years , probably more .
At any rate : print on fiber , do n’t skimp on the fix and wash , and tone your prints .
These things take FOREVER to print and finish , but it ’s totally worth it .
If you analog printers have any specific questions , hit me up in the comments — I could talk for days on this stuff .
SO WHAT DID I MISS ?
The topic of printing requires a huge series of article on it ’s own , so I ’m sure we did n’t cover everything here .
If you have specific questions about printing methods , techniques , and theories — do ask !!!
I spoke with Oscar ( my professional printer and fellow artist ) about this article and asked him to chime in on the technical stuff .
He ’s more than willing to answer our questions and take part in the discussion .
This guy is a fountain of knowledge on the topic , so do n’t pass up the opportunity to tap into him !
Murder , torture , abuse and photos of the same .
We 've seen some of them , of course .
Now , evidently under pressure from his top generals , President Obama has decided to fight the release of other grim photos from the dark side of the Bush years of offshore injustice -- on the grounds that their publication might inflame opinion in the Middle East and our various war zones ( as if fighting to suppress their publication wo n't ) .
In this way , just as the president is in the process of making Bush 's wars his own , so he seems to be making much of the nightmare legacy of those years of crime , torture , and cover - up his , too .
The photos his Justice Department will fight to suppress ( for how long or how successfully we do n't yet know ) are now officially " his " ; next , assumedly , come those military commissions , suspended as Obama took office , which are evidently about to be reborn as Obama era tools of injustice .
( This brings to mind , in grimmer form , the old saw about how military justice is to justice as military music is to music . )
And with those commissions comes that wonderfully un-Constitutional idea of detaining chosen prisoners indefinitely either entirely without trial or with trials that will be mockeries .
And with that , evidently , goes the idea of possibly setting up some sort of new " national security court " to try some detainees .
( Keep in mind that the Obama administration is already hanging on tightly to Dick Cheney 's " state secrets " privilege to block various lawsuits by those wronged in all sorts of ways in the Bush years . )
In other words , if you can't go to court and get the punishments you want , the solution is simply to create courts jiggered in such a way ( and surrounded by enough secrecy ) that you 'll get the decisions you desire .
If that is n't a striking definition of American justice , I do n't know what is .
Obama 's national security world is now coming into view -- and it's not a pretty picture , but then , as Noam Chomsky points out , in a tour de force piece below , it has n't been a pretty picture for a long , long time .

For one thing , even without inquiry , it was reasonable to suppose that Guantanamo was a torture chamber .
Why else send prisoners where they would be beyond the reach of the law -- a place , incidentally , that Washington is using in violation of a treaty forced on Cuba at the point of a gun ?
Security reasons were , of course , alleged , but they remain hard to take seriously .
The same expectations held for the Bush administration 's " black sites , " or secret prisons , and for extraordinary rendition , and they were fulfilled .
The torture memos released by the White House elicited shock , indignation , and surprise .
The shock and indignation are understandable .
The surprise , less so .

Security reasons were , of course , alleged , but they remain hard to take seriously .
The same expectations held for the Bush administration 's " black sites , " or secret prisons , and for extraordinary rendition , and they were fulfilled .
More importantly , torture has been routinely practiced from the early days of the conquest of the national territory , and continued to be used as the imperial ventures of the " infant empire " -- as George Washington called the new republic -- extended to the Philippines , Haiti , and elsewhere .
Keep in mind as well that torture was the least of the many crimes of aggression , terror , subversion , and economic strangulation that have darkened U.S. history , much as in the case of other great powers .
Accordingly , what 's surprising is to see the reactions to the release of those Justice Department memos , even by some of the most eloquent and forthright critics of Bush malfeasance : Paul Krugman , for example , writing that we used to be " a nation of moral ideals " and never before Bush " have our leaders so utterly betrayed everything our nation stands for . "
To say the least , that common view reflects a rather slanted version of American history .
Occasionally the conflict between " what we stand for " and " what we do " has been forthrightly addressed .
One distinguished scholar who undertook the task at hand was Hans Morgenthau , a founder of realist international relations theory .
In a classic study published in 1964 in the glow of Camelot , Morgenthau developed the standard view that the U.S. has a " transcendent purpose " : establishing peace and freedom at home and indeed everywhere , since " the arena within which the United States must defend and promote its purpose has become world - wide . "
But as a scrupulous scholar , he also recognized that the historical record was radically inconsistent with that " transcendent purpose . "
We should not be misled by that discrepancy , advised Morgenthau ; we should not " confound the abuse of reality with reality itself . "
Reality is the unachieved " national purpose " revealed by " the evidence of history as our minds reflect it . "
What actually happened was merely the " abuse of reality . "
The release of the torture memos led others to recognize the problem .
In the New York Times , columnist Roger Cohen reviewed a new book , The Myth of American Exceptionalism , by British journalist Geoffrey Hodgson , who concludes that the U.S. is " just one great , but imperfect , country among others . "
Cohen agrees that the evidence supports Hodgson 's judgment , but nonetheless regards as fundamentally mistaken Hodgson 's failure to understand that " America was born as an idea , and so it has to carry that idea forward . "
The American idea is revealed in the country 's birth as a " city on a hill , " an " inspirational notion " that resides " deep in the American psyche , " and by " the distinctive spirit of American individualism and enterprise " demonstrated in the Western expansion .
Hodgson 's error , it seems , is that he is keeping to " the distortions of the American idea , " " the abuse of reality . "
Let us then turn to " reality itself " : the " idea " of America from its earliest days .
" Come Over and Help Us "
The inspirational phrase " city on a hill " was coined by John Winthrop in 1630 , borrowing from the Gospels , and outlining the glorious future of a new nation " ordained by God . "
One year earlier his Massachusetts Bay Colony created its Great Seal .
It depicted an Indian with a scroll coming out of his mouth .
On that scroll are the words " Come over and help us . "
The British colonists were thus pictured as benevolent humanists , responding to the pleas of the miserable natives to be rescued from their bitter pagan fate .
The Great Seal is , in fact , a graphic representation of " the idea of America , " from its birth .
It should be exhumed from the depths of the psyche and displayed on the walls of every classroom .
It should certainly appear in the background of all of the Kim Il - Sung - style worship of that savage murderer and torturer Ronald Reagan , who blissfully described himself as the leader of a " shining city on the hill , " while orchestrating some of the more ghastly crimes of his years in office , notoriously in Central America but elsewhere as well .
The Great Seal was an early proclamation of " humanitarian intervention , " to use the currently fashionable phrase .
As has commonly been the case since , the " humanitarian intervention " led to a catastrophe for the alleged beneficiaries .
The first Secretary of War , General Henry Knox , described " the utter extirpation of all the Indians in most populous parts of the Union " by means " more destructive to the Indian natives than the conduct of the conquerors of Mexico and Peru . "
Long after his own significant contributions to the process were past , John Quincy Adams deplored the fate of " that hapless race of native Americans , which we are exterminating with such merciless and perfidious cruelty among the heinous sins of this nation , for which I believe God will one day bring [ it ] to judgement . "
The " merciless and perfidious cruelty " continued until " the West was won . "
Instead of God 's judgment , the heinous sins today bring only praise for the fulfillment of the American " idea . "
The conquest and settling of the West indeed showed that " individualism and enterprise , " so praised by Roger Cohen .
Settler - colonialist enterprises , the cruelest form of imperialism , commonly do .
The results were hailed by the respected and influential Senator Henry Cabot Lodge in 1898 .
Calling for intervention in Cuba , Lodge lauded our record " of conquest , colonization , and territorial expansion unequalled by any people in the 19th century , " and urged that it is " not to be curbed now , " as the Cubans too were pleading , in the Great Seal 's words , " come over and help us . "
Their plea was answered .
The U.S. sent troops , thereby preventing Cuba 's liberation from Spain and turning it into a virtual colony , as it remained until 1959 .
The " American idea " was illustrated further by the remarkable campaign , initiated by the Eisenhower administration virtually at once to restore Cuba to its proper place , after Fidel Castro entered Havana in January 1959 , finally liberating the island from foreign domination , with enormous popular support , as Washington ruefully conceded .
What followed was economic warfare with the clearly articulated aim of punishing the Cuban population so that they would overthrow the disobedient Castro government , invasion , the dedication of the Kennedy brothers to bringing " the terrors of the earth " to Cuba ( the phrase of historian Arthur Schlesinger in his biography of Robert Kennedy , who considered that task one of his highest priorities ) , and other crimes continuing to the present , in defiance of virtually unanimous world opinion .
American imperialism is often traced to the takeover of Cuba , Puerto Rico , and Hawaii in 1898 .
But that is to succumb to what historian of imperialism Bernard Porter calls " the saltwater fallacy , " the idea that conquest only becomes imperialism when it crosses saltwater .
Thus , if the Mississippi had resembled the Irish Sea , Western expansion would have been imperialism .
From George Washington to Henry Cabot Lodge , those engaged in the enterprise had a clearer grasp of just what they were doing .
After the success of humanitarian intervention in Cuba in 1898 , the next step in the mission assigned by Providence was to confer " the blessings of liberty and civilization upon all the rescued peoples " of the Philippines ( in the words of the platform of Lodge 's Republican party ) -- at least those who survived the murderous onslaught and widespread use of torture and other atrocities that accompanied it .
These fortunate souls were left to the mercies of the U.S. - established Philippine constabulary within a newly devised model of colonial domination , relying on security forces trained and equipped for sophisticated modes of surveillance , intimidation , and violence .
Similar models would be adopted in many other areas where the U.S. imposed brutal National Guards and other client forces .
The Torture Paradigm
Over the past 60 years , victims worldwide have endured the CIA 's " torture paradigm , " developed at a cost that reached $ 1 billion annually , according to historian Alfred McCoy in his book A Question of Torture .
He shows how torture methods the CIA developed from the 1950s surfaced with little change in the infamous photos at Iraq 's Abu Ghraib prison .
There is no hyperbole in the title of Jennifer Harbury 's penetrating study of the U.S. torture record : Truth , Torture , and the American Way .
So it is highly misleading , to say the least , when investigators of the Bush gang 's descent into the global sewers lament that " in waging the war against terrorism , America had lost its way . "
None of this is to say that Bush - Cheney - Rumsfeld et al. did not introduce important innovations .
In ordinary American practice , torture was largely farmed out to subsidiaries , not carried out by Americans directly in their own government - established torture chambers .
As Allan Nairn , who has carried out some of the most revealing and courageous investigations of torture , points out : " What the Obama [ ban on torture ] ostensibly knocks off is that small percentage of torture now done by Americans while retaining the overwhelming bulk of the system 's torture , which is done by foreigners under U.S. patronage .
Obama could stop backing foreign forces that torture , but he has chosen not to do so . "
Obama did not shut down the practice of torture , Nairn observes , but " merely repositioned it , " restoring it to the American norm , a matter of indifference to the victims .
" [ H ] is is a return to the status quo ante , " writes Nairn , " the torture regime of Ford through Clinton , which , year by year , often produced more U.S. - backed strapped - down agony than was produced during the Bush / Cheney years . "
Sometimes the American engagement in torture was even more indirect .
In a 1980 study , Latin Americanist Lars Schoultz found that U.S. aid " has tended to flow disproportionately to Latin American governments which torture their citizens , ... to the hemisphere 's relatively egregious violators of fundamental human rights . "
Broader studies by Edward Herman found the same correlation , and also suggested an explanation .
Not surprisingly , U.S. aid tends to correlate with a favorable climate for business operations , commonly improved by the murder of labor and peasant organizers and human rights activists and other such actions , yielding a secondary correlation between aid and egregious violation of human rights .
These studies took place before the Reagan years , when the topic was not worth studying because the correlations were so clear .
Small wonder that President Obama advises us to look forward , not backward -- a convenient doctrine for those who hold the clubs .
Those who are beaten by them tend to see the world differently , much to our annoyance .
Adopting Bush 's Positions
An argument can be made that implementation of the CIA 's " torture paradigm " never violated the 1984 Torture Convention , at least as Washington interpreted it .
McCoy points out that the highly sophisticated CIA paradigm developed at enormous cost in the 1950s and 1960s , based on the " KGB 's most devastating torture technique , " kept primarily to mental torture , not crude physical torture , which was considered less effective in turning people into pliant vegetables .
McCoy writes that the Reagan administration then carefully revised the International Torture Convention " with four detailed diplomatic ' reservations ' focused on just one word in the convention 's 26 - printed pages , " the word " mental . "
He continues : " These intricately - constructed diplomatic reservations re-defined torture , as interpreted by the United States , to exclude sensory deprivation and self - inflicted pain -- the very techniques the CIA had refined at such great cost . "
When Clinton sent the UN Convention to Congress for ratification in 1994 , he included the Reagan reservations .
The president and Congress therefore exempted the core of the CIA torture paradigm from the U.S. interpretation of the Torture Convention ; and those reservations , McCoy observes , were " reproduced verbatim in domestic legislation enacted to give legal force to the UN Convention . "
That is the " political land mine " that " detonated with such phenomenal force " in the Abu Ghraib scandal and in the shameful Military Commissions
Act that was passed with bipartisan support in 2006 .
Bush , of course , went beyond his predecessors in authorizing prima facie violations of international law , and several of his extremist innovations were struck down by the Courts .
While Obama , like Bush , eloquently affirms our unwavering commitment to international law , he seems intent on substantially reinstating the extremist Bush measures .
In the important case of Boumediene v. Bush in June 2008 , the Supreme Court rejected as unconstitutional the Bush administration claim that prisoners in Guantanamo are not entitled to the right of habeas corpus .
Salon.com columnist Glenn Greenwald reviews the aftermath .
Seeking to " preserve the power to abduct people from around the world " and imprison them without due process , the Bush administration decided to ship them to the U.S. prison at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan , treating " the Boumediene ruling , grounded in our most basic constitutional guarantees , as though it was some sort of a silly game -- fly your abducted prisoners to Guantanamo and they have constitutional rights , but fly them instead to Bagram and you can disappear them forever with no judicial process . "
Obama adopted the Bush position , " filing a brief in federal court that , in two sentences , declared that it embraced the most extremist Bush theory on this issue , " arguing that prisoners flown to Bagram from anywhere in the world ( in the case in question , Yemenis and Tunisians captured in Thailand and the United Arab Emirates ) " can be imprisoned indefinitely with no rights of any kind -- as long as they are kept in Bagram rather than Guantanamo . "
In March , however , a Bush - appointed federal judge " rejected the Bush / Obama position and held that the rationale of Boumediene applies every bit as much to Bagram as it does to Guantanamo . "
The Obama administration announced that it would appeal the ruling , thus placing Obama 's Department of Justice , Greenwald concludes , " squarely to the Right of an extremely conservative , pro-executive - power , Bush 43 - appointed judge on issues of executive power and due- process - less detentions , " in radical violation of Obama 's campaign promises and earlier stands .
The case of Rasul v. Rumsfeld appears to be following a similar trajectory .
The plaintiffs charged that Rumsfeld and other high officials were responsible for their torture in Guantanamo , where they were sent after being captured by Uzbeki warlord Rashid Dostum .
The plaintiffs claimed that they had traveled to Afghanistan to offer humanitarian relief .
Dostum , a notorious thug , was then a leader of the Northern Alliance , the Afghan faction supported by Russia , Iran , India , Turkey , and the Central Asian states , and the U.S. as it attacked Afghanistan in October 2001 .
Dostum turned them over to U.S. custody , allegedly for bounty money .
The Bush administration sought to have the case dismissed .
Recently , Obama 's Department of Justice filed a brief supporting the Bush position that government officials are not liable for torture and other violations of due process , on the grounds that the Courts had not yet clearly established the rights that prisoners enjoy .
It is also reported that the Obama administration intends to revive military commissions , one of the more severe violations of the rule of law during the Bush years .
There is a reason , according to William Glaberson of the New York Times : " Officials who work on the Guantanamo issue say administration lawyers have become concerned that they would face significant obstacles to trying some terrorism suspects in federal courts .
Judges might make it difficult to prosecute detainees who were subjected to brutal treatment or for prosecutors to use hearsay evidence gathered by intelligence agencies . "
A serious flaw in the criminal justice system , it appears .
Creating Terrorists
There is still much debate about whether torture has been effective in eliciting information -- the assumption being , apparently , that if it is effective , then it may be justified .
By the same argument , when Nicaragua captured U.S. pilot Eugene Hasenfuss in 1986 , after shooting down his plane delivering aid to U.S. - supported Contra forces , they should not have tried him , found him guilty , and then sent him back to the U.S. , as they did .
Instead , they should have applied the CIA torture paradigm to try to extract information about other terrorist atrocities being planned and implemented in Washington , no small matter for a tiny , impoverished country under terrorist attack by the global superpower .
By the same standards , if the Nicaraguans had been able to capture the chief terrorism coordinator , John Negroponte , then U.S. ambassador in Honduras ( later appointed as the first Director of National Intelligence , essentially counterterrorism czar , without eliciting a murmur ) , they should have done the same .
Cuba would have been justified in acting similarly , had the Castro government been able to lay hands on the Kennedy brothers .
There is no need to bring up what their victims should have done to Henry Kissinger , Ronald Reagan , and other leading terrorist commanders , whose exploits leave al - Qaeda in the dust , and who doubtless had ample information that could have prevented further " ticking bomb " attacks .
Such considerations never seem to arise in public discussion .
There is , to be sure , a response : our terrorism , even if surely terrorism , is benign , deriving as it does from the city on the hill .
Perhaps culpability would be greater , by prevailing moral standards , if it were discovered that Bush administration torture had cost American lives .
That is , in fact , the conclusion drawn by Major Matthew Alexander [ a pseudonym ] , one of the most seasoned U.S. interrogators in Iraq , who elicited " the information that led to the US military being able to locate Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the head of al - Qa'ida in Iraq , " correspondent Patrick Cockburn reports .
Alexander expresses only contempt for the Bush administration 's harsh interrogation methods : " The use of torture by the U.S. , " he believes , not only elicits no useful information but " has proved so counter - productive that it may have led to the death of as many U.S. soldiers as civilians killed in 9/11 . "
From hundreds of interrogations , Alexander discovered that foreign fighters came to Iraq in reaction to the abuses at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib , and that they and their domestic allies turned to suicide bombing and other terrorist acts for the same reasons .
There is also mounting evidence that the torture methods Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld encouraged created terrorists .
One carefully studied case is that of Abdallah al - Ajmi , who was locked up in Guantanamo on the charge of " engaging in two or three fire fights with the Northern Alliance . "
He ended up in Afghanistan after having failed to reach Chechnya to fight against the Russians .
After four years of brutal treatment in Guantanamo , he was returned to Kuwait .
He later found his way to Iraq and , in March 2008 , drove a bomb - laden truck into an Iraqi military compound , killing himself and 13 soldiers -- " the single most heinous act of violence committed by a former Guantanamo detainee , " according to the Washington Post , and according to his lawyer , the direct result of his abusive imprisonment .
All much as a reasonable person would expect .
Unexceptional Americans
Another standard pretext for torture is the context : the " war on terror " that Bush declared after 9/11 .
A crime that rendered traditional international law " quaint " and " obsolete " -- so George W. Bush was advised by his legal counsel Alberto Gonzales , later appointed Attorney General .
The doctrine has been widely reiterated in one form or another in commentary and analysis .
The 9/11 attack was doubtless unique in many respects .
One is where the guns were pointing : typically it is in the opposite direction .
In fact , it was the first attack of any consequence on the national territory of the United States since the British burned down Washington in 1814 .
Another unique feature was the scale of terror perpetrated by a non-state actor .
Horrifying as it was , however , it could have been worse .
Suppose that the perpetrators had bombed the White House , killed the president , and established a vicious military dictatorship that killed 50,000 to 100,000 people and tortured 700,000 , set up a huge international terror center that carried out assassinations and helped impose comparable military dictatorships elsewhere , and implemented economic doctrines that so radically dismantled the economy that the state had to virtually take it over a few years later .
That would indeed have been far worse than September 11 , 2001 .
And it happened in Salvador Allende 's Chile in what Latin Americans often call " the first 9/11 " in 1973 .
( The numbers above were changed to per-capita U.S. equivalents , a realistic way of measuring crimes . )
Responsibility for the military coup against Allende can be traced straight back to Washington .
Accordingly , the otherwise quite appropriate analogy is out of consciousness here in the U.S. , while the facts are consigned to the " abuse of reality " that the naïve call " history . "
It should also be recalled that Bush did not declare the " war on terror , " he re-declared it .
Twenty years earlier , President Reagan 's administration came into office declaring that a centerpiece of its foreign policy would be a war on terror , " the plague of the modern age " and " a return to barbarism in our time " -- to sample the fevered rhetoric of the day .
That first U.S. war on terror has also been deleted from historical consciousness , because the outcome cannot readily be incorporated into the canon : hundreds of thousands slaughtered in the ruined countries of Central America and many more elsewhere , among them an estimated 1.5 million dead in the terrorist wars sponsored in neighboring countries by Reagan 's favored ally , apartheid South Africa , which had to defend itself from Nelson Mandela 's African National Congress ( ANC ) , one of the world 's " more notorious terrorist groups , " as Washington determined in 1988 .
In fairness , it should be added that , 20 years later , Congress voted to remove the ANC from the list of terrorist organizations , so that Mandela is now , at last , able to enter the U.S. without obtaining a waiver from the government .
The reigning doctrine of the country is sometimes called " American exceptionalism . "
It is nothing of the sort .
It is probably close to a universal habit among imperial powers .
France was hailing its " civilizing mission " in its colonies , while the French Minister of War called for " exterminating the indigenous population " of Algeria .
Britain 's nobility was a " novelty in the world , " John Stuart Mill declared , while urging that this angelic power delay no longer in completing its liberation of India .
Similarly , there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Japanese militarists in the 1930s , who were bringing an " earthly paradise " to China under benign Japanese tutelage , as they carried out the rape of Nanking and their " burn all , loot all , kill all " campaigns in rural North China .
History is replete with similar glorious episodes .
As long as such " exceptionalist " theses remain firmly implanted , however , the occasional revelations of the " abuse of history " often backfire , serving only to efface terrible crimes .
The My Lai massacre was a mere footnote to the vastly greater atrocities of the post - Tet pacification programs , ignored while indignation in this country was largely focused on this single crime .
Watergate was doubtless criminal , but the furor over it displaced incomparably worse crimes at home and abroad , including the FBI - organized assassination of black organizer Fred Hampton as part of the infamous COINTELPRO repression , or the bombing of Cambodia , to mention just two egregious examples .
Torture is hideous enough ; the invasion of Iraq was a far worse crime .
Quite commonly , selective atrocities have this function .
Historical amnesia is a dangerous phenomenon , not only because it undermines moral and intellectual integrity , but also because it lays the groundwork for crimes that still lie ahead .
